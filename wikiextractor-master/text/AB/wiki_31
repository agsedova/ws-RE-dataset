The Unit aims to reduce offending by the use of empirically sound risk assessment tools and a brokerage case management model, which targets criminogenic needs.\n\nThe Corrections Program Unit was established in 2001 as the Rehabilitation Programs Unit. The Unit incorporates existing programs and services that focus on targeted intervention and supervision of offenders. The services of the Unit are consistent with a focus on specific programs for offenders that address identified risks and criminogenic needs.\n\nCustodial Operations consists of the following:\n\nIt also formerly consisted of the Belconnen Remand Centre and Symonston Temporary Remand Centre. The Belconnen Remand Centre opened in 1976 and closed in 2009.\n\nCustodial Operations administrates the Remand Centres Act 1976 (RCA) which establishes remand centres in the ACT. The Superintendent is responsible for directing and controlling the operations of the ACT adult custodial facilities. The facilities main objective is to carry out the mandate of the court and to ensure the provision of safe care and secure accommodation to those in custody in a controlled environment. The facilities have a responsibility to address a duty of care for each individual, accommodating both genders and a variety of cultures.\n\nUnder section 6A of the RCA an Official Visitor is appointed. The duties of this officer involve visiting and inspecting the facilities at least once each week, and inquiring into complaints by detainees.\n\nPeriodic detention provides an effective alternative sentencing option for ACT offenders. Currently this sentencing option is served on weekends, starting on Friday 7.00 pm and ending on Sunday 4.30 pm. Detainees make a positive contribution to the community while serving their period of detention by performing unpaid community work. To accommodate the increased number of periodic detainees, ACT Corrective Services is currently investigating the possibility of extending periodic detention to mid-week.\n\nThe Court Transport Unit is responsible for transporting prisoners between interstate correctional centres and the ACT, transporting prisoners and remandees (including juveniles) within the ACT, and the provision of safe and secure custody of prisoners and remandees in ACT Courts.\n\n"}

As is still typically the case in contemporary parliamentary politics, the members of the Council were selected from the parliament or \"Sejm\" of the Commonwealth. Even though it exerted some constructive influence in Polish politics and government, because of its unpopularity during the Partitions period, in some Polish texts it was dubbed as \"Zdrada Nieustająca\" - Permanent Betrayal.\n\nThe establishment of an institution of permanent council, an early form of executive government in the late years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was originally recommended by the political reformer Stanisław Konarski. It was intermittently under consideration, as permitted by Poland's intrusive neighbors, during the period of government reforms, beginning with the Convocation Sejm of 1764. The Permanent Council was actually created in 1775 by the Partition Sejm, when Empress Catherine the Great of Russia and her ambassador to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, became convinced that it was a way of securing the Empire's influence over the internal politics of Poland (control over the \"Sejm\" and the King). The Council had remained in continuous operation and was therefore largely immune from szlachta's \"liberum veto\" obstructionism, which could be pursued only during the sessions of the \"Sejm\". The Council was also much less prone than the \"Sejm\" to other distractions from minor gentry. Empress Catherine and Ambassador Stackelberg believed that the Council would be dominated by anti-royal magnates and that it would put an end to the King's push toward reforms. \n\nThe Council was composed of King Stanisław August Poniatowski (who acted as a modern prime minister and had two votes instead of one), 18 members from the Senate and 18 members from the \"Sejm's\" lower chamber. The Council, in addition to its administrative duties, would present to the King three candidates for each nomination to the Senate and other main offices. The meetings were supervised by Marshal Roman Ignacy Potocki. \n\nIn reality all the Council's members were nominated in accordance with the wishes of Ambassador Stackelberg, who acted as a representative of the Empress, protectress of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth since 1768. Soon after its creation, the Council became an instrument of Russian surveillance over Poland.\n\nThe council was divided onto 5 separate ministries called Departments:\n\nAmong the prerogatives of the Council was heading the state administration, preparation of projects of laws and \"Sejm\" acts, which were to be later accepted by the parliament, control over law enforcement and interpretation of the law. Although heavily criticized, most notably by the Familia and the so-called Patriotic Party, the Council managed to give rise to a period of economic prosperity in Poland. Its functioning strengthened (despite the intentions of some of its creators) the power of the monarch and reduced the power of the already existing and highly influential magnate-ministers, who were placed under the Council's supervision. The Permanent Council was eliminated in 1789 by the Four-Year Sejm and briefly reinstated in 1793 by the Sejm of Grodno. However, this time it was directly headed by the Russian ambassador. Majority of the Council's members were then bribed by the Russian embassy in Warsaw.\n\n\n"}

Among his most influential works is the 1984 book \"Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain\".\n\nBorn in Hull in 1927, Peter Fryer was awarded a scholarship to attend Hymers College in 1938. After joining the Young Communist League in 1942, he left school in 1943 to become a reporter on the \"Yorkshire Post\". In 1945 he became a member of the Communist Party. In 1947 he was dismissed from his job after refusing to leave the party.\n\nIn 1948 Fryer joined the staff of the \"Daily Worker\", becoming its parliamentary correspondent but also covering foreign affairs. In 1949 he reported on the show trial of the Hungarian communist László Rajk, who had falsely confessed to being an agent of Tito and others. After Rajk's execution and eventual \"rehabilitation\" early in 1956 Fryer felt guilty about his acquiescence in the trial.\n\nIn October 1956 Fryer was sent to Hungary to cover the uprising. His dispatches, including a description of the suppression of the uprising by Soviet troops, were either heavily censored or suppressed, and he left the paper. His resignation had in fact taken place several months earlier, but he had been persuaded to serve a year's notice. He wrote a book about the uprising (\"Hungarian Tragedy\", 1956) and was expelled from the Communist Party for criticising its suppression in the \"capitalist\" press. \"Hungarian Tragedy\" is still in print. The most recent edition also contains some articles he completed after the book, which was published very quickly after the events he witnessed.\n\nFryer then became the editor of \"The Newsletter\", the journal of The Club, a Trotskyist organisation led by Gerry Healy, and with Healy was a founder member of the Socialist Labour League. He parted company with Healy, however, and was delighted when Healy's organisation expelled him in 1985. Fryer wrote a weekly column for the \"Workers Press\", the paper of the organisation that had expelled Healy, for several years after 1985. As a socialist journalist he was inspiring and painstaking, and wrote articles about how to write for the widest political audience, later collected in his book \"Lucid, Vigorous and Brief\" (1993).\nIn 1948 Fryer had covered the arrival at Tilbury Docks in Britain of bringing settlers from the Caribbean. His interest in their experiences ultimately resulted in the writing of \"Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain\" (1984). Two short related books by Fryer, originally given as lectures, are also in print: \"Aspects of British Black History\" and \"The Politics of Windrush\".\n\nAt the time of his death Fryer was working on a study of life in Mississippi in the 19th and 20th centuries, under the working title \"Behind the Blues\". He intended this book to rework black American history and hoped that it would be as influential as \"Staying Power\" had been. He had also just found out that he was to be honoured by the Hungarian government, in recognition of his \"continuous support of the Hungarian revolution and freedom fight\". Fryer was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary at a reception at the Hungarian Embassy in London.\n\n"}

{"id": "1953926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1953926", "title": "Meshwesh", "text": "Meshwesh\n\nThe Meshwesh (often abbreviated in ancient Egyptian as Ma) were an ancient Libyan tribe from Cyrenaica. According to Egyptian hieroglyphs, this area is where the Nasamones and Mermidae inhabited.\n\nEarly records of the Mae date back to the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt from the reign of Amenhotep III. During the 19th and 20th dynasties (c. 1295 – 1075 BC), the Meshwesh were in almost constant conflict with the Egyptian state. During the late 21st Dynasty, increasing numbers of Libyans began to settle in the Western Delta region of Egypt. They would ultimately take control of the country during the late 21st Dynasty first under Osorkon the Elder. After an interregnum of 38 years, during which the native Egyptian kings Siamun and Psusennes II assumed the throne, the Meshwesh ruled Egypt throughout the 22nd and 23rd Dynasties under such powerful pharaohs as Shoshenq I, Osorkon I, Osorkon II, Shoshenq III and Osorkon III.\n\nThat the Meshwesh were of Libyan origin is explicitly stated in a genealogy contained on the stela of Pasenhor (dated to the reign of Shoshenq V), where the great chiefs of the Meshwesh (including the kings of the 22nd Dynasty) are stated to be the descendants of \"Buyuwawa the Libyan.\" The Libyo origin of the Ma is also indicated in their personal names (such as Osorkon, Takelot, Nimlot, Shoshenq, etc.) and a handful of non-Egyptian titles used by these people that are related to the Libyan Language , a different language from Other North African Languages. This language has been identified as \"Old Libyan\" (French \"vieux libyque\"), an ancestral language of the Berber dialects. After the Egyptians, the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various other tribes in Libya. Later tribal names differ from the Egyptian ones but, probably, some tribes were named in the Egyptian sources and the later ones, as well.\n\nThe Meshwesh are known from ancient Egyptian texts as early as the 18th Dynasty, where they are mentioned as a source of cattle provided to king Amenhotep III's palace at Malkata. This indicates there may have been some trade relations between the Meshwesh and the Egyptians at the time. At the very least, it can be said that the Egyptians were familiar with the Meshwesh. For the remainder of the 18th Dynasty, information about Meshwesh or Libyans in general is sketchy. There are, however, representations of Libyans (perhaps Meshwesh) from the reign of Akhenaten, including a remarkable papyrus depicting a group of Libyans slaying an Egyptian. However, the papyrus is fragmentary, so it is not known what the historical context was. The Meshwesh or Ma were nomad hunter pastoralists, living off their goats, camels and other livestock while hunting and gathering at the same time. Milk, meat, hides and wool were gathered from their livestock for food, tents and clothing.\n\nThe first Ancient Egyptian sources described the Meshwesh men with tattoos and long hair with longer side locks in the front, while centuries later they appear with shorter hair of Egyptian influence but braided and beaded, neatly parted in both sides from their temples and decorated with one or two feathers attached to leather bands around the crown of the head. They still used the same robes as before, a thin mantle of antelope hide, dyed and printed, crossing one of their shoulders and coming down until mid calf length to make an open robe over a loincloth with an adorned phallus sheath, being the only exception of the new addition of a kilt above the knees and an animal tail in the Egyptian manner of king Narmer and the phallus adornment over it. Men wore facial hair trimmed except at their chin and the older men kept their longer chin tufts braided. Women wore the same robes as men, plaited, decorated hair and both genders wore heavy jewelry. Later images showed them to have accepted and adapted some Greek or Macedonian tunics. Weapons included bows and arrows, hatchets, spears and daggers.\n\nThe relations between the Libyans and the Egyptians during the Ramesside Period were typically one of constant conflict. Battle reliefs at Karnak from the reign of Seti I depict the king in combat with Libyan masses; however the text only describes the Libyans as being \"Tjehenu\", one of the generic terms for \"Libyan\" in the Egyptian language, rather than a specific tribal designation. During the following reign, that of Ramesses II, the Egyptians constructed a series of coastal fortresses running west to the region of Marsa Matruh, including at al-Alamayn and Zawayat Umm al-Rakham. The presence of these fortresses indicates a serious threat from the west, and Ramesses does claim to have overthrown Libyans in various rhetorical texts. However, as with Seti I, he does not specify if Meshwesh were involved or not.\nDuring the reign of Merneptah it seems that the early-warning system from his father's time had fallen into disrepair, as there was an unexpected Libyan invasion into the Nile Delta and the Western Oases in Year 5 of his reign. Unlike his predecessors, Merenptah states in his battle reliefs at Karnak that it was primarily the Libu tribe who led the conflict, but that Meshwesh and Sea People allies were also involved. Indeed, Merenptah claims that \"9,100 swords of the Meshwesh\" were captured. (This conflict is also described on the Merneptah Stele, also known as the \"Israel Stele\".)\n\nAbout twenty-five years later, during the reign of Ramesses III, the growing conflict between the Egyptians and Libyans came to a head. This time, it was the Meshwesh who instigated the conflict, though other Libyan tribes and their Sea People allies were involved in fighting two major campaigns against the Egyptian king, in Ramesses III's Regnal Years 5 and 11. The Year 11 campaign was concerned almost exclusively with the Meshwesh, however. Ramesses claimed victory, and settled the Meshwesh in military concentration camps in Middle Egypt in order to force their assimilation into Egyptian culture and press them into military service for the Egyptian state. According to Papyrus Harris I, Ramesses \"settled [them] in strongholds of the Victorious King, they hear the language of the [Egyptian] people, serving the King, he makes their language disappear.\"\n\nA Third Intermediate Period text mentions there being at least five \"Fortresses of the Meshwesh\" in the area of Herakleopolis Magna; these were probably the ones established by Ramesses. Throughout the 20th Dynasty, various texts on ostraca and papyri mention attacks by Meshwesh tribesmen as far south as Thebes, where the workmen of Deir el-Medina were forced to seek protection inside the mortuary temple of Medinet Habu.\n\nDuring the late Third Intermediate Period, the Nile Delta hosted the four great chiefdoms of the Meshwesh, each ruled by a \"Great Chief of the Ma\", whose seats of power were in the cities of Mendes, Sebennytos, Busiris and Per-Sopdu respectively; other lesser chiefdoms, led by a simple \"Chief of the Ma\", were located at Sais and Pharbaithos.\n\nIn the 8th century, the Napatan kings (whose capital was located in Jebel Barkal, Sudan), founders of the 25th Dynasty, dominated the Libyan kinglets and leaders (Meshouesh, Rebu, etc.), presenting themselves as being the only legitimate pharaohs through the divine recognition of the god Amun.\n\n\n"}

The same name was later used to refer to the formal language of the inputs to this planner. This language is the base for most of the languages for expressing automated planning problem instances in use today; such languages are commonly known as action languages. This article only describes the language, not the planner.\n\nA STRIPS instance is composed of:\n\n\nMathematically, a STRIPS instance is a quadruple formula_1, in which each component has the following meaning:\n\n\nA plan for such a planning instance is a sequence of operators that can be executed from the initial state and that leads to a goal state.\n\nFormally, a state is a set of conditions: a state is represented by the set of conditions that are true in it. Transitions between states are modeled by a transition function, which is a function mapping states into new states that result from the execution of actions. Since states are represented by sets of conditions, the transition function relative to the STRIPS instance formula_1 is a function\n\nwhere formula_10 is the set of all subsets of formula_2, and is therefore the set of all possible states.\nThe transition function formula_12 for a state formula_13, can be defined as follows, using the simplifying assumption that actions can always be executed but have no effect if their preconditions are not met:\n\nThe function formula_12 can be extended to sequences of actions by the following recursive equations:\n\nA plan for a STRIPS instance is a sequence of actions such that the state that results from executing the actions in order from the initial state satisfies the goal conditions. Formally, formula_17 is a plan for formula_18 if formula_19 satisfies the following two conditions:\n\nThe above language is actually the propositional version of STRIPS; in practice, conditions are often about objects: for example, that the position of a robot can be modeled by a predicate formula_22, and formula_23 means that the robot is in Room1. In this case, actions can have free variables, which are implicitly existentially quantified. In other words, an action represents all possible propositional actions that can be obtained by replacing each free variable with a value.\nThe initial state is considered fully known in the language described above: conditions that are not in formula_5 are all assumed false. This is often a limiting assumption, as there are natural examples of planning problems in which the initial state is not fully known. Extensions of STRIPS have been developed to deal with partially known initial states.\n\nA monkey is at location A in a lab. There is a box in location C. The monkey wants the bananas that are hanging from the ceiling in location B, but it needs to move the box and climb onto it in order to reach them.\n\nDeciding whether any plan exists for a propositional STRIPS instance is PSPACE-complete. Various restrictions can be enforced in order to decide if a plan exists in polynomial time or at least make it an NP-complete problem.\n\nIn the Monkey and banana problem, the robot monkey has to execute a sequence of actions to reach the banana at the ceiling. A single action provides a small change in the game. To simplify the planning process, it make sense to invent an abstract action, which isn't available in the normal rule description. The super-action consists of low level actions and can reach high-level goals. The advantage is that the computational complexity is lower, and longer tasks can be planned by the solver. \n\nIdentifying new macro operators for a domain can be realized with genetic programming. The idea is, not to plan the domain itself, but in the pre-step, a heuristics is created which allows to solve the domain much faster. In the context of reinforcement learning, a macro-operator is called an option. Similar to the definition within AI planning, the idea is, to provide a temporal abstraction (span over a longer period) and to modify the game state directly on a higher layer.\n\n\n"}

This song is also loosely based on the song \"Oh, where, oh, where, has my little dog gone?\" \n\nThe best-known version of the song was the original, recorded by Patti Page on December 18, 1952, and released in January 1953 by Mercury Records as catalog numbers 70070 (78 rpm) and 70070X45 (45 rpm) under the title \"The Doggie in the Window\", with the flip side being \"My Jealous Eyes\". It reached No. 1 on both the \"Billboard\" and \"Cash Box\" charts in 1953, and sold over two million copies. Mercury, however, had poor distribution in the United Kingdom. Therefore, a recording by Lita Roza was the one most widely heard in the UK, reaching No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1953. It distinguished Roza as the first British woman to have a number-one hit in the UK chart. It was also the first song with a question in the title to reach number 1.\n\n\"Doggie\" was one in a series of successful novelty songs since the 1930s, following on the success of songs such as Bing Crosby's \"Pistol Packin' Mama\" and Merv Griffin's \"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\". Prior to the release of \"Doggie\", composer Bob Merrill penned \"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake\". The original Page recording included the sounds of dogs barking, credited on the label as \"Barks by Joe and Mac\" (her arranger, Joe Reisman, and a violinist). The recording also features Page's signature multi-part tight harmonies, all sung by Page. Throughout the years, she recorded several other versions as well.\n\nOn April 4, 1953, singer Patti Page's rendition of \"The Doggie in the Window\" went to No. 1 in the US \"Billboard\" magazine chart, staying at that top spot for eight weeks. The song was wildly popular across a wide demographic. The song had school children \"yipping\"; Mercury Records was besieged with requests for free puppies; and the American Kennel Club's annual registrations spiked up by eight percent. In all, Page's record sold over 2 million copies.\n\nFollowing the top ten entrance of Lita Roza's cover version on March 14, 1953, the Patti Page version of the song was released in the UK on March 28, renamed \"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window\" (sans question mark), under Mercury's \"Oriole Records\" label. Given the delay getting to market in the UK, it was not as successful as the Roza version, only entering the charts at number nine before leaving the charts altogether five weeks later. The Roza version went to number one, lasting in that spot for one week. But for five weeks between 28 March 1953 and 25 April 1953, there were two versions of \"Doggie\" in the UK top twelve singles chart.\n\nAccording to rock historian Michael Uslan, \"novelty songs\" like \"Doggie\" led to the \"fervent embrace of rock & roll\" by 1955. \"A lot of songs at that time were extremely bland, squeaky-clean stuff. The music field was ripe for something new, something vibrant to shake the rafters.\"\n\nThe song has since become a popular children's song. Bob Merrill's lyrics were reworked by Iza Trapani into her 2004 children's book, \"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?\".\n\nThe phrase \"How much is that doggie in the window?\" seemed innocent enough in 1953, but in modern times it has become synonymous with the trade in puppies from pet shops, often originating in puppy mills.\n\nIn 2009, Patti Page recorded a version of the song with a new title (\"Do You See That Doggie in the Shelter\") together with new lyrics by Chris Gantry, with the hopes of emphasizing the adoption of homeless animals from animal shelters. The rights to that song were given exclusively to the Humane Society of the United States. Said Page:\n\nA season five episode of Cold Case, \"Devil's Music\", used Patti Page's recording in the opening.\n\nThe 2007 video game \"BioShock\" does not use the original overdubbed Mercury recording. Instead a 1966 re-recording by Patti Page with full orchestra for Columbia Records was substituted.\n\nRoza was a singer with The Ted Heath jazz band during the 1950s. During this period, she was voted Favourite Female Vocalist in a \"Melody Maker\" poll from 1951 to 1955 and a similar poll in \"New Musical Express\" from 1952 to 1955.\n\nIn 1951, she recorded \"Allentown Jail\" with the Heath Band, which led to her A&R Dick Rowe asking her to sing \"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\". Her initial response was negative, \"I'm not recording that, it's rubbish.\" She recalled that he pleaded with her, responding \"It'll be a big hit, please do it, Lita.\" She relented, saying she would record it but never sing it again afterwards.\n\n\"Doggie\" was a new entry in the UK charts on 14 March 1953 at number nine. It moved up to number three in its second and third week of release before dropping down to number four on 4 April. On 11 April it moved up to number two for a week, before becoming number one on 18 April. This made Lita Roza both the first female vocalist to top the UK singles chart and the first person from Liverpool, long before the success of The Beatles or Cilla Black. It held the top spot for one week, before gradually dropping down the top ten over the next five weeks, with its final week in the top ten being at number nine on 23 May.\n\nLita Roza was widely reported to have strongly disliked her song. In an interview in 2004 she revealed that she had kept her promise never to perform the song, \"I sang it once, just one take, and vowed I would never sing it again. When it reached number one, there was enormous pressure to perform it but I always refused. It just wasn't my style.\" However, she would go on to be most widely remembered for that song. In 2001, Roza opened Liverpool's Wall of Hits on Matthew Street, home of The Cavern Club. On display were various discs from every British number-one from Merseyside, the first being her own.\n\nThe song returned to the spotlight briefly during the 1980s as the result of an interview with \"Smash Hits\" magazine, wherein Margaret Thatcher, who was then serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, admitted that Lita Roza's version of \"Doggie\" was her favourite song of all time.\n\nFollowing Roza's death in August 2008, she left £300,000 in her will to charities, of which £190,000 went to three dog-related charities: Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, and The Cinnamon Trust.\n\nThe song has also been parodied a few times, including:\n\n\n"}

The name \"water net\" comes from the (usually pentagonal or hexagonal) mesh structure of their colonies, which can extend several decimeters.\n\nAlgae in the genus can reproduce asexually or sexually. Asexual reproduction takes place by biflagellated (having two flagella) zoospores formed by the thousands inside a cell. However, the zoospores hardly move, as they are packed very densely. The zoospores form a cell wall, become cylindrical in shape, and arrange themselves in a hexagonal pattern, much like the mature tissue. The mother cell disintegrates, releasing the microscopic daughter net.\n\nDuring sexual reproduction, which takes place by iso-gametes (gametes of the same size) even smaller than the zoospores, the iso-gametes escape through a hole in the cell wall of the mother cell. Two gametes fuse, forming a zygote, which then develops a thick cell wall and becomes angular in shape. After a rest period, 2-5 zoospores, which are bigger than the ones formed by asexual reproduction, are produced. The zoospores then enlarge into polygonal cells. The cytoplasm of the cells then divide into new zoospores which lose their flagella and form a new net by lying against each other.\n\n"}

Its best-known version was recorded by Guy Mitchell in 1952. The song reached #18 on the \"Cashbox\" charts in August 1952. The song also reached #2 on the UK charts in November 1952, becoming the first ever number two record in the UK.\n\nThe narrator of the song is a former lowlife who is reforming so he can set a good example for his newborn son, whom he loves. The title refers to the tradition of spanking a newborn baby just after birth, to ensure it draws breath.\n"}

{"id": "1953991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1953991", "title": "TNT KaTropa", "text": "TNT KaTropa\n\nThe TNT KaTropa (formerly known as the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters) is a professional basketball team currently owned by Smart Communications, a subsidiary of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), playing in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) since 1990.\n\nThe franchise began in 1990 when Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. (PCPPI) acquired a PBA franchise. Under PCPPI, the franchise played under the names Pepsi and 7 Up. In 1996, the franchise came under the control of Pilipino Telephone Corporation (Piltel) and played under the name Mobiline. In 2001, the franchise was renamed Talk 'N Text after the operations of Piltel was absorbed by Smart Communications.\n\nThe team is currently one of three PBA teams under the control of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan – the others are the Meralco Bolts and NLEX Road Warriors. To date, the franchise has won seven official PBA titles (and one special PBA tournament championship), it also remains as one of the league's powerhouses and it is one of the oldest teams in PBA.\n\nPepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. was accepted as one of two new members of the PBA during the 1990 season, joining soft drink rival Pop Cola. They were known as the Pepsi Hotshots in their maiden year 1990. Their first coach was Ed Ocampo, assisted by Olympian Bobby Littaua, and the team manager was Steve Watson.\n\nAfter winning its inaugural game against another expansion team Pop Cola, 149–130, with import Derek Hamilton scoring 77 points, the Hotshots lost all their remaining games in the first conference. Their 15-game losing streak stretched into the All-Filipino, before they finally won over Diet Sarsi, formerly Pop Cola. In the third conference, San Miguel Beermen assistant coach Derrick Pumaren replaced Ed Ocampo as the Hotshots' head coach, and the Pepsi franchise went 0 wins, 10 losses in the season-ending tournament.\n\nIn 1991, Pepsi acquired Manny Victorino from Presto, and the team increased its number of wins, but still failed to make it past eliminations in the first two conferences. They attempted to become a competitive team by offering a 5-year, P25 million contract to Purefoods TJ Hotdogs' top gun Alvin Patrimonio. Patrimonio stayed with Purefoods after his mother team matched the offer. However, this did not stop Pepsi from entering the semifinals and finishing fourth among the eight teams in the third conference.\n\nIn 1992, Pepsi acquired ROY Eugene Quilban in a trade which sent Jun Reyes to Alaska. The Hotshots placed 7th in the first conference. After the Pepsi \"349\" controversy, the team was renamed as the 7 Up Uncolas.\n\n7 Up placed runner-up in the 1992 Reinforced Conference. Their import was an NBA veteran point guard, Dell Demps. They were swept by the Swift Mighty Meaties, led by Tony Harris in the finals, 4–0. Prior to the finals, 7 Up and Swift were fined on a so-so game where Swift intentionally lost the match in order to eliminate Ginebra from the finals race. 7 Up was bannered by players Manny Victorino, Abet Guidaben, Eugene Quilban and Naning Valenciano. Quilban recorded 28 assists during a game that year, which is still a PBA record.\n\nDespite getting 2nd overall pick Victor Pablo, 7 Up failed to reach the semifinals in the first two conferences of the season. In the third conference, the team's name reverted to Pepsi, but to be known as the Pepsi Mega Bottlers. They eventually placed fourth in the 1993 Governors' Cup.\n\nBefore the 1994 PBA Governor's Cup, Pepsi and Sunkist were involved in a rare coaching trade that saw Derrick Pumaren moving to the RFM franchise for Yeng Guiao. Despite the coaching change, Pepsi's on-and-off performance continued with their best finish, taking third place in the 1994 Governors' Cup with import Ronnie Coleman. In the 1995, even with a strong start in the Governors' Cup, they had a 5–2 win-loss card but never took home a trophy at the end of the tournament.\n\nPepsi was also known as a hard-luck PBA team because it never found considerable success after finishing runner-up in the 1992 Reinforced Conference. After it failed to land Alvin Patrimonio in 1991, the ballclub attempted again in 1995 to dangle a 5-year, P28.8 million contract to Sta. Lucia Realtors' main man Jun Limpot. However, Sta. Lucia matched the offer and Pepsi had to contend with blue-collar players in Alvin Teng (acquired from San Miguel in exchange for Victor Pablo), Dindo Pumaren (from Purefoods in exchange for Richie Ticzon), Eugene Quilban and Boy Cabahug to lead the team.\n\nBefore the start of the 1996 season, Frederick Dael took over as the new president of Pepsi Cola Products Philippines, Inc. As such, a change in marketing priority took effect and they are mulling to disband the PBA franchise. To prevent the team in disbanding, Luis, \"Moro\" Lorenzo, chairman of PCPPI, intended to sell the PBA franchise to Duty Free Philippines, a company he also owned, for one peso (P1) to retain its ownership. Should Duty Free will disband the PBA franchise, it will be returned to Pepsi. The sale was rejected by the Board of Governors on a special meeting on January 5 since Duty Free was not majority-owned by Lorenzo. The Hotshots continued on with their campaign in the All-Filipino Cup, finishing last with a 4–10 record.\n\nAfter the All-Filipino Cup, PBA Board of Governors approved the ownership transfer of the franchise from Pepsi Cola Products Philippines, Inc. to Lapanday Holdings Corporation, a holding company of the Lorenzo family. This will enable the Lorenzos to market and use a different brand for their PBA team. Pagemark Philippines, Inc., a company under Lapanday Holdings and Pilipino Telephone Corporation (PILTEL) were tasked to find a new name for the team. After negotiations, the team was rechristened as the Mobiline Cellulars.\n\nSince the Lorenzos still owned the team through their holding company, the records of the Pepsi team were retained. Point guard Eugene Quilban and power forward Alvin Teng led the team.\n\nMobiline acquired the first overall pick from Pop Cola and used it to draft Filipino-American Andrew John Seigle. The Cellulars also drafted Tony Boy Espinosa and signed Patrick Fran from free agency. Mobiline hired former San Miguel coach Norman Black, and acquired 1995 Rookie of the Year Jeffrey Cariaso from Alaska via an offer sheet bearing a three-year contract worth P18.3 million.\n\nIn the All-Filipino Conference, the Cellulars advanced to the semifinals but faltered in the Commissioner's Cup with Isaiah Morris as reinforcement. In the Governor's Cup, they paraded Artemus \"Tee\" McClary and hired a new coach, Derrick Pumaren, with Tommy Manotoc as consultant. Mobiline posted a decent finish in the Governor's Cup but failed to enter the semis.\n\nIn 1998, the Phone Pals struggled in the All-Filipino with a 4–7 record. In the Commissioner's Cup, it hired former Purefoods mentor Eric Altamirano. The Pals, as in the '97 Governor's Cup, were eliminated in the quarterfinals with Terquin Mott as import.\n\nAndy Seigle and Jeffrey Cariaso were borrowed by the national team for the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok. They captured the 1998 PBA Centennial (the Philippines was then celebrating its 100th anniversary of the independence from Spain) Cup by beating Shell by a hairline, 67–66, in overtime led by imports Silas Mills and McClary, with the help of veteran locals Glen Capacio and Al Solis. However, the Centennial Cup was a special tournament and the title was not considered an official championship.\n\nThe records after the elimination round of the tournament was carried over in the Governor's Cup. The Pals retained their winning way and advanced to the finals in a rematch with the Zoom Masters. Mobiline held a 3–2 series lead but lost the last two games to wind up in second place. Mills ended up winning the Best Import of the Governors' Cup.\n\nSeeking for bigger things in 1999, Mobiline acquired Filipino-Tongan Pauliasi Taulava to man the Pals' frontline along with Seigle. Mobiline started the All-Filipino with a 7–0 record before losing a crucial game to San Miguel. The Pals ended up with the best record after the elimination phase but were defeated by a gritty Barangay Ginebra Kings squad despite a twice to beat advantage on Bal David's incredible last second shot.\n\nThe rest of the year, Mobiline was eliminated in the quarters during the Commissioner's and Governor's Cup, while Taulava's eligibility as a legitimate Filipino-foreigner was questioned. During the midseason, Mobiline traded Andy Seigle to Purefoods for veteran Jerry Codinera.\n\n2000 saw some lineup changes for the Phone Pals, as the team acquired Vic Pablo in the three-team trade that sent Jeffrey Cariaso to Tanduay and Mark Telan to Shell Velocity.\n\nTaulava was deported later in the year as the Pals were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the All-Filipino with new coach Louie Alas. The Pals wound up with the best record in the elimination phase of the Governor's Cup. After surviving a quarterfinals meeting with Barangay Ginebra, Purefoods eliminated Mobiline in four games. The Phone Pals finished 4th after losing to Batang Red Bull Thunder in a knockout game for third place.\n\nIn 2001, Mobiline tried to acquire Kenneth Duremdes through free agency, but Alaska matched Mobiline's offer sheet of a reported 48 million pesos, and Duremdes stayed with the Aces. The Phone Pals drafted former Manila Metrostar Gilbert Demape, but the Phone Pals, for the sixth time in seven conferences, were eliminated by top seed Shell in the quarterfinals. In the Commissioner's Cup, the Pals bannered Michigan University standout Jerod Ward, who exploded for 61 points in his debut. Later, Taulava returned to the Philippines after an approval by the Justice Department; despite this, the Phone Pals failed to get past the quarterfinals. The Governor's Cup also held the same fate for the Phone Pals despite changing their name to \"Talk 'N Text\" and having Brandon Williams as import.\n\nBeginning in the 2001 Governors' Cup, the franchise came under the control of Smart Communications after the company absorbed the operations of Pilipino Telephone Corporation. The team changed its name to \"Talk 'N Text Phone Pals\".\n\nBefore the 2002 season, Talk 'N Text fired Alas and hired former UNLV coach Bill Bayno, despite numerous calls by the nationalist Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines to ban the American mentor. Although they lost Asi Taulava and Patrick Fran to the National Pool, Talk 'N Text was bannered by Richie Frahm and Jerald Honeycutt, a replacement for an original import. The Phone Pals ended up as the top team in the elimination phase of the Governor's Cup but suffered the same fate as in 1999, when the eighth seed San Miguel Beermen upset the Pals.\n\nTalk 'N Text finally broke the spell in the Commissioner's Cup, led by Honeycutt and Pete Mickeal, when the seventh seeded Phone Pals defeated Sta. Lucia in the quarterfinals and Alaska in a five-game semis affair to enter their third Finals appearance in team history, and the first since 1998. In the end, Red Bull defeated Talk 'N Text in seven grueling games.\n\nBayno later left the team, but without some parting shots on the PBA when he accused the league of favoring the San Miguel Corporation teams.\n\nIn the All-Filipino, Taulava returned to the team after his national team stint in the Asian Games, but the Phone Pals got the early boot in the quarterfinals under new head coach Paul Woolpert, another American coach who replaced the departed Bill Bayno.\n\nIn 2003, the Phone Pals used two first round picks to draft Fil-Americans Harvey Carey and Jimmy Alapag, who was with the RP national pool in 2002. The Pals struggled early in the All-Filipino. Midway to that tournament, Woolpert left the team and was replaced with Ateneo coach Joel Banal, who had led the Blue Eagles to the UAAP title in 2002.\n\nTalk 'N Text rose to the tournament and captured the All-Filipino Cup over defending champion Coca-Cola in six games. After an overtime win in Game Five, the Phone Pals became the first team since 1982 to come back from a 0–2 deficit to win the next four games after a hard-fought Game Six victory. Taulava was named as the PBA Finals MVP, after winning the Best Player of the Conference award.\n\nThey also qualified in the 2003 PBA Invitationals, where four guest teams were invited. Joel Banal left the team for the moment to concentrate on his Ateneo Blue Eagles stint in the UAAP. The Phone Pals did not qualify for the semis, but not without controversy. Needing to win by eight points over Red Bull Barako to qualify, the Phone Pals deliberately fouled several Red Bull players in the last two minutes to force an overtime or even reach the needed eight point margin. The game turned out to be more disgraceful when Jojo Manalo tried to hit a three-pointer on Red Bull's basket. The incident led to a hefty fine and a five-game suspension for acting coach Ariel Vanguardia.\n\nIn the revived Reinforced Conference, Talk 'N Text was bannered by Damian Cantrell but finished with a 7–6 mark, good for 4th place in Group B. They upset the top seeded Red Bull Barako 2–1 that ended with Jimwell Torion's clothesline on Jimmy Alapag's face that led to the latter's suspension for eight months, which was later reduced.\n\nIn the semis, Talk 'N Text was swept by eventual champions Coca-Cola, but the Phone Pals captured third place in the tournament after beating Sta. Lucia in a one-game playoff for third place.\n\nAsi Taulava became the first Filipino-foreign player since Ricardo Brown in 1985 to win the coveted Most Valuable Player award. Jimmy Alapag won the Rookie of the Year honors to wrap up the Phone Pals' incredible year.\n\nJoel Banal resigned as Ateneo head coach to concentrate on the Talk 'N Text team. In the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference, the Phone Pals were bannered by 2002 MVP Willie Miller and Yancy de Ocampo in separate deals with Red Bull and FedEx.\n\nThe Phone Pals made it to the semis of the tournament, but lost in a three-game showdown with crowd favorite Barangay Ginebra Kings.\n\nIn the 2004–05 Philippine Cup, the Phone Pals placed second in the classification phase to qualify for the semifinals. They swept the Shell Turbo Chargers but were defeated in six games by Barangay Ginebra.\n\nDuring this tournament, Asi Taulava was considered by the Department of Justice as one of six Filipino-foreigners suspected of falsifying their documents. Taulava was suspended by the PBA indefinitely, along with five other players.\n\nTaulava gained some advantage from the Quezon City RTC, but the PBA still didn't give Taulava the go-signal. In the Finals of the Philippine Cup, the Phone Pals used Taulava despite the league's refusal to allow Taulava. Talk 'N Text reasoned a court order that allowed Asi to play in the series. The Phone Pals wound up winning Game One by double figures, but the game was forfeited two days later, awarding the win to Barangay Ginebra. The Phone Pals later announced that they would not allow Taulava to play for the rest of the series.\n\nIn the 2004–05 Fiesta Conference, the Phone Pals finished first after the classification phase, earning an outright semifinals berth. In the semis, the Phone Pals eliminated the soon departing Shell Turbo Chargers, 3–1, to face San Miguel in the finals series.\n\nTaulava was once again used by Talk 'N Text, but this time the league gave the go-signal for Taulava to return and play for his mother ballclub. Asi showed rustiness during the series as the Phone Pals lost the series to San Miguel, 4–1. Willie Miller was named as the Best Player of the Conference.\n\nTalk 'N Text acquired rookies Jay Washington and Mark Cardona from the Air21 Express for Yancy de Ocampo and Patrick Fran in separate deals.\n\nThe Phone Pals were considered as top favorites in the 2005–06 Fiesta Conference. However, the Phone Pals lost in five grueling games to Air21 in the quarterfinals. During the series, import Damien Cantrell was replaced by former Detroit Piston and NBA champion Darvin Ham. However, Ham did not fit in Talk 'N Text's system, and struggled.\n\nAfter the disappointing finish in this tournament, Joel Banal resigned as head coach and was replaced by returning coach Derrick Pumaren (his second stint after the 1997 season). The change made some good strides in the early stages of his second stint with Talk 'N Text. With Pumaren using the star players Asi Taulava and Jimmy Alapag, and mixing Harvey Carey and seldom-used rookie Mark Cardona, the Phone Pals went 5–4 through nine games of the Philippine Cup.\n\nHowever, the Phone Pals suffered three succeeding losses, prompting team officials to land Ren-Ren Ritualo from Air21 for Leo Avenido and a future first round draft pick, Don Allado from Alaska for Willie Miller, John Ferriols and a future first round pick on May 8. The move saw the Phone Pals as a potential title contender with the squad boasting a group of star players from their past teams along with Taulava, Alapag, Cardona and Carey. Even with a strong lineup, the trade put the Phone Pals in a deeper hole, losing three more games before a win against Coca-Cola gave them a disappointing 6–10 card.\n\nIn the wildcard phase, the Phone Pals did not win a single game in the round-robin format. In their initial game, Talk 'N Text lost to Barangay Ginebra, eliminating them from quarterfinal contention before losing their final two games to Air21 and Sta. Lucia.\n\nThe Phone Pals had a shot of taking the No. 1 pick in the draft but they traded that rights to Air21 in a trade months ago, which dealt a big blow to the franchise. Rumors then speculated that TNT management was set to make drastic changes for the team after their disappointing season.\n\nTalk 'N Text released Poch Juinio, while the contracts of Vergel Meneses and Chris Cantonjos were not renewed, leaving the team with only 10 players. The Phone Pals participated in the 2006 NBA Summer Pro League. In the 2006 PBA Draft, they selected Mark Andaya in the first round, their only pick in the draft.\n\nTalk 'N Text managed to start off big in the 2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup, but a string of losses put them beneath the standings. A late surge, followed by a crucial Christmas Day victory over Ginebra, gave the team a 10–8 record and a quarterfinals berth against Purefoods. The Phone Pals won the series 3–1, dethroning the defending Philippine Cup champions by winning the next three games by convincing margins. At the semifinals, they took crowd favorite Barangay Ginebra Kings to six games but they were eliminated by the eventual champions; they defeated Red Bull Barako in the third-place game.\n\nIn the 2007 PBA Fiesta Conference, the Phone Pals barged into the Finals after surviving a quarterfinal scare against the Air21 Express and upsetting first seed Red Bull Barako to face the Alaska Aces. The Aces drew first blood by taking game 1 but fell behind with a 1–2 series deficit after newly crowned Best Player of the Conference Mark Cardona scoring big. Newly crowned MVP candidate Willie Miller erupted for 29 points to tie the series. Cardona then had an answer when he top-scored all locals on Game 5.\n\nCardona gave the ball away in the dying seconds for the Aces to tie the series 3-all. Game 7 was a tight affair but the Aces broke through with a Miller steal off Cardona to seal Talk 'N Text's third successive Finals defeat.\n\nTalk 'N Text was a rising powerhouse team after the 2007 Fiesta Conference Finals, with a star-studded line-up bannered by Asi Taulava, Jimmy Alapag, Don Allado, Jay Washington, Harvey Carey, Renren Ritualo, Mac-Mac Cardona, and Yousif Aljamal. However, former MVP Taulava's point production dipped when he opted to concentrate on the defensive end. His dismal performance on the team cost him his slot at the Phone Pals roster. On November 26, 2007, the Asi Taulava era at Talk 'N Text officially ended when the prized Fil-Tongan center was shipped to the Coca-Cola Tigers in exchange for Ali Peek and a 2008 first-round draft pick.\n\nTaulava and the Tigers then had a 5-game winning streak, while the Phone Pals could only muster a three-win streak of their own. On the final game of the elimination round, with TNT needing to win to force a playoff for the last quarterfinal berth, Taulava and the Tigers beat the Phone Pals to deny them the playoff and instead arranged a sudden death wildcard game between the two teams. With Taulava and another ex-Phone Pal Mark Telan playing inspired basketball, the Tigers eliminated the #6 seed Phone Pals in the first wildcard round.\n\nThis led to rumors of team management firing Derrick Pumaren and his staff, but after a meeting with the players, it was decided to defer the decision until after the next tournament, the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference.\n\nHowever, on January 28, 2008, it was announced that former San Miguel Beermen head coach Chot Reyes would replace Pumaren as coach.\n\nIn the 2008 Fiesta Conference, Talk 'N Text had a 5-game losing streak after starting with a 7–3 record to finish with a 9–9 record. This caused them to go through the wildcard phase once again; after beating Purefoods in a fight-marred contest, the Phone Pals dropped at the second wildcard round against the Sta. Lucia Realtors to deny them of quarterfinal qualification for the 2007–08 season.\n\nThe team announced a new name for the 2008–09 season, the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters. They drafted Jared Dillinger and Singapore Slingers' Jayson Castro, who had left the team after the team left Australia's National Basketball League, center Robert Reyes. The Texters relied on Mark Cardona to finish with an 11–7 record, good for second place and a semifinal berth, behind Alaska. Cardona participated in the last two plays that led to their Finals qualification, beating the San Miguel Beermen in Game 6. The Texters and the Aces faced off anew in the Finals, this time with Talk 'N Text winning in seven games, thanks to Cardona, Alapag and Ranidel de Ocampo's plays down the stretch in Game 7.\n\nDuring the off-season, Tropang Texters signed Nic Belasco and dealt 18th draft pick Kevin White to the Gin Kings. They have also transferred Yousif Aljamal and Rob Reyes to the Barako Bull. After a lot of deliberation, Japeth Aguilar finally was ousted from the Burger King Whoppers as he was forwarded to the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters in exchange for four first round future picks (2010, 2012, 2013, 2014) and undisclosed amount of money.\n\nTNT walk out against Ginebra during their Game 4 of the Quarter Finals and they failed to defend their title. As a preparation for the Fiesta Conference they traded Ren-Ren Ritualo and Yancy de Ocampo to the Air 21 in exchange for JR Quinahan, Mark Yee and Aaron Aban. While TNT has 8–2 win/lose record, They traded Pong Escobal, Ali Peek and Nic Belasco to Sta Lucia Realators in exchange of Kelly Williams, Ryan Reyes and Charles Waters. After the trade, they had a 7-game winning streak, but lost to their last assignment Bmeg gave them a 15–3 win/lose record good for 1st place. In the semis, They lost to the Tim Cone mentored Alaska Aces into seven games, due to foul out early Talk N Text's import Shawn Daniels.\n\nThe beginning of the 2010s saw the dominance of the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, who nearly got the Grand Slam in the 2010–11 season when winning the 2010–11 PBA Philippine Cup and 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup, but they eventually were the runner-up in the 2011 PBA Governors' Cup, where Petron was the champion.\n\nTNT won the 2010–2011 Philippine Cup Championship on February 4, 2011 after beating San Miguel Beermen in Game 6 with a score of 95–82. Jayson Castro and his teammate, Jimmy Alapag were awarded as co-MVP of the finals. The team won the Championship in the 2011 Commissioner's Cup on May 8, 2011 in an epic overtime win against Barangay Ginebra Kings in Game 6 of their best-of-seven series with a score of 99–96. The Finals MVP were once more awarded to both Jayson Castro and Jimmy Alapag. This was the team's 4th Championship of which 3 were achieved under coach Chot Reyes's tenure.\n\nComing into the Governor's Cup, TNT were heavy favorites as they aimed for the rare triple crown conference. They ended up at first place in the elimination with a 6–2 win-loss record, and added three wins against two losses in the semifinal round to secure the first finals seat, eventually facing the depleted Petron Blaze Boosters in a full seven game series which started with a buzzer beater win by Petron in game 1. Their shot at the Grandslam was revived when they recovered from a 3–2 deficit to force a Game 7 but eventually lost to Petron, 85–73 in game 7.\n\nThis was the first time that Talk 'N Text and Powerade faced each other in the finals, since the 2003 PBA All-Filipino Cup, which Talk 'N Text won the series in five games.\n\nTalk 'N Text won the championship series, 4–1 becoming the first team in league history to win back-to-back All-Filipino crown after 27 years, since 1985.\n\nTalk 'N Text defeated Rain or Shine by sweeping the series, 4–0 and winning their third consecutive Philippine Cup taking permanent possession of the Jun Bernardino Trophy, which is awarded to the champions of the tournament since the 2006–07 season.\n\nIn Philippine cup Tropang Texters are qualified in eliminations, finishing with 8–6 record, but lost to San Mig Coffee Mixers in best of 3 quarter finals matches. Before the playoffs started, Talk 'N Text was traded Sean Anthony, rookie Eliud Poligrates and a 2016 first-round pick to Air21 in exchange for Niño \"KG\" Canaleta.\n\nTalk 'N Text finished the elimination round of 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup undefeated with 9–0 and they defeated Barangay Ginebra San Miguel on the quarterfinals with twice to beat advantage in only first game and they defeated and sweep once again the semifinals against their former rival Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, 3–0 to extend the streak which makes them the first team in 34 years to enter the PBA Finals undefeated with 13–0 (or since Crispa went 17–0 to enter 1980 All-Filipino Finals). Their import Richard Howell recorded a career high 30 rebounds, surpassing his previous record of 20, in an 85–72 victory over the Alaska Aces in his first game for the Texters. They will defend their streak as they will face the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers on the best of 5 series in the finals. They got their first loss to the Mixers on the game 1 of the finals but they were able to bounce back on game 2 to tie the series to 1–1 but lost again to the Mixers on game 3, 77–75.

The Texters fought the San Miguel Beermen on a best of seven of the semifinals and due to lack of legitimate center, they got swept by the Beermen, 4–0.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the Texters' long-time Team Captain Jimmy Alapag formally announced his retirement during a press conference at the Smart Araneta Coliseum prior to the second game of the 2014–15 PBA Philippine Cup Finals between the Alaska Aces and the San Miguel Beermen. However, he took on a new role as the team manager.\n\nAs the new Team Manager Jimmy Alapag first move was to bring back the 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup Best Import, Richard Howell, as they prepared for 2015 PBA Commissioner's Cup. On January 25, 2015, The 37-year-old, two-time MVP Willie Miller, in an interview with InterAksyon.com, said that he has agreed to terms with the Tropang Texters, a franchise he played several seasons for in the past.

Sammy Kaye's version peaked at No. 11 (U.S.) in 1952. In the United Kingdom, Tony Brent's cover version reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1953.\n\nThe song is a prodigal son allegory about a young man (the story's metaphorical \"robin\") who could not fly and could only walk all the way back to his old home in Missouri, following a life of partying in the big city jazz scene - or the repercussions that happened as a result. During the course of the song, it transpired that he had \"met a birdie who looked so nice\", who, until the end, was secretly having an affair with someone else. While the song does not make any details of the revelation, it can be gleaned from the last verse that the protagonist was forced out of his comfort zone and likely lost money: \"His dreams are battered, his feathers bent/And he hasn't got a cent/He feels like his heart is gonna break\". The song, at the end, urges the listeners to show this \"robin\" some kindness if he ever approaches them, because the mistake is an easy one to make.\n\n"}

{"id": "1954004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954004", "title": "Philippine Navy", "text": "Philippine Navy\n\nThe Philippine Navy (PN; Filipino: Hukbong Dagat ng Pilipinas; Spanish: Fuerza Naval de Filipinas) is the naval warfare service branch of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It has an estimated strength of 25,000 active service personnel, including the 7,500-strong Philippine Marine Corps. It operates 115 ships and 25 aircraft. It shares the responsibility of patrolling the maritime borders with the Philippine Coast Guard, a formerly attached unit which became a separate maritime law enforcement agency in 1998.\n\nBefore the Spanish arrived in the Philippines the ancient peoples there were engaging in naval warfare, trade, piracy, travel and communication using balangay. A flotilla of balangay was discovered in the late 1970s in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte.\nPhilippine ships, such as the \"karakao\" or \"korkoa\", were of excellent quality and some of them were used by the Spaniards in expeditions against rebellious tribes and Dutch and British forces. Some of the larger rowed vessels held up to a hundred rowers on each side besides a contingent of armed troops. Generally, the larger vessels held at least one \"lantaka\" at the front of the vessel or another one placed at the stern. Philippine sailing ships called \"praos\" had double sails that seemed to rise well over a hundred feet from the surface of the water. Despite their large size, these ships had double outriggers. Some of the larger sailing ships, however, did not have outriggers.\n\nAntecedent to this raids, sometime between A.D. 1174 and 1190, a traveling Chinese government bureaucrat Chau Ju-Kua reported that a certain group of \"\"ferocious raiders of China’s Fukien coast\"\" which he called the \"Pi-sho-ye,\" believed to have lived on the southern part of Formosa.\nIn A.D. 1273, another work written by Ma Tuan Lin, which came to the knowledge of non-Chinese readers through a translation made by the Marquis D’Hervey de Saint-Denys, gave reference to the \"Pi-sho-ye\" raiders, thought to have originated from the southern portion of Formosa. However, the author observed that these readers spoke a different language and had an entirely different appearance (presumably when compared to the inhabitants of Formosa).\n\nIn the Battle of Manila in 1365 is an unspecified and disputed battle occurring somewhere in the vicinity of Manila between the forces of the Kingdoms in Luzon and the Empire of Majapahit.\n\nEven though the exact dates and details of this battle remain in dispute, there are claims of the conquest of the area around Saludong (Majapahit term for Luzon and Manila) according to the text \"Nagarakretagama\"\n\nNevertheless, there may have been a battle for Manila that occurred during that time but it was likely a victory for Luzon's kingdoms considering that the Kingdom of Tondo had maintained its independence and was not enslaved under another ruler. Alternatively, Luzon may have been successfully invaded but was able to regain its independence later.\n\nThe Republic's need for a naval force was first provided for by Filipino revolutionaries when they included a provision in the Biák-na-Bató Constitution. This authorised the government to permit privateers to engage foreign enemy vessels.\n\nOn May 1, 1898, the first ship handed by Admiral George Dewey to the Revolutionary Navy is a small pinnace from the Reina Cristina of Admiral Patricio Montojo, which was named \"Magdalo\".\n\nThe Philippine Navy was established during the second phase of the Philippine Revolution when General Emilio Aguinaldo formed the Revolutionary Navy which was initially composed of a small fleet of eight Spanish steam launches captured from the Spaniards. The ships were refitted with 9-centimeter guns. The rich, namely Leon Apacible, Manuel Lopez and Gliceria Marella de Villavicencio, later donated five other vessels of greater tonnage, the \"Taaleño\", the \"Balayan\", the \"Bulusan\", the \"Taal\" and the \"Purísima Concepción\". The 900-ton inter-island tobacco steamer further reinforced the fleet, \"Compania de Filipinas\" (renamed as the navy flagship \"Filipinas\"), steam launches purchased from China and other watercraft donated by wealthy patriots.\n\nNaval stations were later established to serve as ships' home bases in the following:\n\nOn September 26, 1898, Aguinaldo appointed Captain Pascual Ledesma (a merchant ship captain) as Director of the Bureau of the Navy, assisted by Captain Angel Pabie (another merchant ship captain). After passing of the Malolos Constitution the Navy was transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Relations to the Department of War (thereafter known as the Department of War and the Navy) headed by Gen. Mariano Trías.\n\nAs the tensions between Filipinos and Americans erupted in 1899 and a continued blockade on naval forces by the Americans, the Philippine naval forces started to be decimated.\n\nThe American colonial government in the Philippines created the Bureau of the Coast Guard and Transportation, which aimed to maintain peace and order, transport Philippine Constabulary troops throughout the archipelago, and guard against smuggling and piracy. The Americans employed many Filipino sailors in this bureau and in the Bureaus of Customs and Immigration, Island and Inter-Island Transportation, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Lighthouses. They also reopened the former Spanish colonial \"Escuela Nautica de Manila\", which was renamed the Philippine Nautical School, adopting the methods of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. The U.S. Naval Academy accepted its first Filipino midshipman in 1919, and Filipinos were able to enlist in the U.S. Navy, just as they were formerly able to do in the Spanish Navy.\n\nIn 1935, the Commonwealth Government passed the National Defense Act, which aimed to ensure the security of the country. This was criticized because it placed the burden of the defense of the Philippines on ground forces, which in turn, was formed from reservists. It discounted the need for a Commonwealth air force and navy, and naval protection was provided by the United States Asiatic Fleet.\n\nWhen World War II began, the Philippines had no significant naval forces after the United States withdrew the Asiatic Fleet following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Philippines had to rely on its OSP with headquarters located at Muelle Del Codo, Port Area, Manila, composed of five high-speed Thorneycroft Coast Motor Boat (CMB) and PT boats, also known as Q-boats, to repel Japanese attacks from the sea.\n\nDuring the course of the war, the OSP were undaunted by the enemy's superiority which they fought with zeal, courage and heroism. For its intrepid and successful missions and raids on enemy ships, the unit was dubbed the \"Mosquito Fleet\" mainly because of its minuscule size, speed and surprise, it showed its capability to attack with a deadly sting. The unit was cited for gallantry in action when its Q-boats Squadron shot three of nine Japanese dive bombers as they were flying towards shore installations in Bataan. The OSP participated in the evacuation of high Philippine and U.S. government officials from Manila to Corregidor when Manila was declared an open city.\nSurviving personnel of the Offshore Patrol that didn't surrender after April 9, 1942 to the Japanese, conducted the recognized guerrilla and local military troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were hit-and-run attacks against the occupying Japanese forces until the return of U.S. Forces. By the end of the war, 66 percent of its men were awarded the Silver Star Medal and other decorations for gallantry in action.\n\nIn 1945, after the liberation of the Philippines, the OSP was reactivated and led by Major Jose Andrada, to reorganize and rebuild from a core of surviving OSP veterans, plus additional recruits. The OSP was strengthened in 1947 after President of the Philippines Manuel Roxas issued Executive Order No. 94. This order elevated the Patrol to a major command that was equal with the Philippine Army, Constabulary, and Air Force. The OSP was renamed the Philippine Naval Patrol, later on changed its name again to the Philippine Navy on January 5, 1951. The first commanding officer of the Navy, Jose Andrada, became its first Commodore and Chief. This was also the year when the naval aviation arm of the Navy was formed, now the Naval Air Group.\n\nIn 1950, Secretary of Defense Ramon Magsaysay created a marine battalion with which to carry out amphibious attacks against the Communist Hukbalahap movement. The next year, President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 389, re-designating the Philippine Naval Patrol as the Philippine Navy. It was to be composed of all naval and marine forces, combat vessels, auxiliary craft, naval aircraft, shore installations, and supporting units that were necessary to carry out all functions of the service.\n\nThe Philippine Navy participated in the Korean War, as well as the Vietnam War, supporting in civil and medical operations. By the 1960s, the Philippine Navy was one of the best-equipped navies in Southeast Asia. In 1967, the maritime law enforcement functions of the Navy were transferred to the Philippine Coast Guard. The duties stayed with the coast guard and in the 1990s it became an independent service under the Department of Transportation.\n\nAfter the 1960s, the government had to shift its attention towards the Communist insurgency and this led to the strengthening of the Philippine Army and the Philippine Air Force while naval operations were confined to troop transport, naval gunfire support, and blockade.\n\nThe Cold War era had reached its endpoint as tensions between the two ideological rivals, the United States and the Soviet Union, simmered down as a result of the dissolution of the latter and the massive change of political system among its allies.\n\nThe fate of the US military bases in the country was greatly affected by these circumstances, aside from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 which engulfed the installations with ash and lava flows. The nearby Clark Air Base was eventually abandoned afterwards, while the Philippine Senate voted to reject a new treaty for Subic Naval Complex, its sister American installation in Zambales. This occurrence had effectively ended the century-old US military presence in the country, even as President Corazon Aquino tried to extend the lease agreement by calling a national referendum, leaving a security vacuum in the region and terminated the inflows of economic and military aid into the Philippines.\n\nConcerns about the Chinese incursion to the sea features claimed by the Philippines and other Southeast Asian states were more pronounced in the last years of the 20th century. This was more evident after the Chinese construction of a military outpost at the Mischief Reef on 1995. As a response, the Philippine Navy dispatched the BRP Sierra Madre and deliberately ran it aground in the Second Thomas Shoal, 5 miles from the Chinese facility and south of the rumored oil-rich Reed Bank, which it maintains as its own station today. \n\nThe importance of territorial defense capability was highlighted in the public eye in 1995 when the AFP published photographs of Chinese structures on Mischief Reef in the Spratlys. Initial attempts to improve the capabilities of the armed forces happened when a law was passed in the same year for the sale of redundant military installations and devote 35% of the proceeds for the AFP upgrades. Subsequently, the legislature passed the AFP Modernization Act. The law sought to modernize the AFP over a 15-year period, with minimum appropriation of 10-billion pesos per year for the first five years, subject to increase in subsequent years of the program. The modernization fund was to be separate and distinct from the rest of the AFP budget.\n\nThe Asian Financial Crisis which struck the region on 1997, greatly affected the AFP Modernization Program due to the government's austerity measures meant to turn the economy around after suffering from losses incurred during the financial crisis.\n\nIn 1998, following the bases' closure, the Philippines-US Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) was signed which contained guidelines for the conduct and protection of American troops visiting the Philippines and stipulated the terms and conditions for the American military to enter Philippine territory. The VFA is a reciprocal agreement that also outlines the requirements for Philippine troops visiting the United States. The Visiting Forces Agreement led to the establishment of the Balikatan exercises, an annual US-Philippine military exercise, as well as a variety of other cooperative measures including the Philippine Bilateral Exercises (PHIBLEX) between the naval forces of the two countries.\n\nThe next decade ushered in a cordial relationship between China and its maritime neighbours including the Philippines until 2011 when tensions rose again after consecutive incidents occurred in the disputed territories. In 2012, a Philippine surveillance aircraft identified Chinese fishing vessels at the then Philippine-controlled Scarborough Shoal, causing the Philippine Navy to deploy the to the area. In response, China sent surveillance ships to warn the Navy to leave the area claimed by both countries, prompting a standoff. The two nations eventually agreed to withdraw their deployed vessels as the arrival of the typhoon season drew near. Following a 3-month standoff between Philippine and Chinese vessels around Scarborough Shoal, China informed the Philippines that Chinese coast guard vessels will remain permanently on the shoal as an integral part of their 'Sansha City' in the Woody island of the Paracels, a separate archipelago disputed by China and Vietnam. Under the control of Hainan Province. the Chinese government plans the island-city to have administrative control over a region that encompasses not only the Paracels, but Macclesfield Bank, a largely sunken atoll to the east, and the Spratly Islands to the south.\n\nThe incidents with the Chinese presence in the South China Sea prompted the Philippines to proceed with formal measures while challenging the Chinese activities in some of the sea features in the disputed island chain. Hence, the South China Sea Arbitration Case was filed by the Philippines in 2013 at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Reminiscent to what occurred on 1995, the Congress passed the Revised AFP Modernization Act of 2012, this was meant to replace the older AFP Modernization Act of 1995, when the 15-year program expired in 2010. Major naval assets for acquisition under the new AFP modernization program include: 2 frigates, 2 corvettes, 2 strategic sealift vessels (SSV), 6 offshore patrol vessels, missile and other weapon systems upgrade, among others.\n\nThe Philippine Navy is administered through the Department of National Defense (DND). Under the AFP structure, the Chief of Staff, AFP (CSAFP), a four-star general/admiral (if the officer is a member of the Philippine Navy), is the most senior military officer. The senior naval officer is the Flag Officer-in-Command (FOIC), usually with a rank of vice admiral. He, along with his or her air force and army counterparts, is junior only to the CSAFP. The FOIC is solely responsible for the administration and operational status of the Navy. The FOIC's counterpart in the U.S. Navy is the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nCurrently, the navy establishment is actually composed of two type commands, the Philippine Fleet and Philippine Marine Corps (PMC). It is further organized into seven naval operational commands, five naval support commands, and seven naval support units. Considering the vastness of the territorial waters that the Navy has to protect and defend, optimal deployment of naval resources is achieved through identification of suitable locations where the presence of these units are capable of delivering responsive services.\n\nThe Philippine Fleet, or simply the \"Fleet\", is under the direct command of the Commander Philippine Fleet while the marine corps is answerable to the commandant, PMC (CPMC). The Flag Officer-In-Command (FOIC) has administrative and operational control over both commands.\n\nThe seven Naval Operation Commands are as follows:\n\nNAVFORWEM and NAVFOREM were formed in August 2006 when Southern Command was split to allow more effective operations against Islamist and Communist rebels within the region.\n\nThe five Naval Support Commands are as follows:\n\nThe Naval Sea Systems Command (NSSC), formerly known as Naval Support Command (NASCOM), provides quality and integrated naval system support and services in order to sustain the conduct of naval operations. It is the biggest industrial complex of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It operates the country's military shipyards, develops new technologies for the Navy, and conducts maintenance on all the Navy's ships. NSSC's principal facilities are at the offshore operating base at Muelle de Codo and at Fort San Felipe in Cavite City.\n\nThe Naval Education, Training & Doctrine Command (NETDC) is the Philippine Navy's institution of learning. Its mission is to provide education and training to naval personnel so that they may be able to pursue progressive naval careers. NETDC is located in Naval Station Leovigildo Gantioqui, San Antonio, Zambales.\n\nThe Naval Reserve Command (NAVRESCOM) organizes, trains, and administers all naval reservists (which includes the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Units midshipmen and midshipwomen). It is responsible for recalling reservists to provide the PN the base for expansion to meet sudden spikes in military manpower demand, as for war, rebellion or natural disaster/calamities and to assist in the socio-economic development of the country. The NAVRESCOM is presently based at Fort Santiago, Manila. It was formerly known as the Home Defense Command.\n\nThe Naval Combat Engineering Brigade (NCEBde), more popularly known as the Seabees, is tasked with combat engineering and amphibious construction in support of Fleet-Marine operations. Naval combat engineers perform tasks such as mobility, counter-mobility, assault, survivability and construction in the conduct of ground combat and amphibious operations. It executes under combat conditions the construction of roads, bridges and other vital infrastructures; the rehabilitation of piers, harbors and beach facilities; and harbor clearing and salvage works. Along with the Philippine Marine Corps, the NCEBde is charged with the manning and security of naval garrisons in shoals and islands located in the West Philippine Sea. The motto of the Seabees is \"We build, We fight!\"\n\nThe Naval Installation Command (NIC), formerly Naval Base Cavite, provides support services to the Philippine Navy and other AFP tenant units in the base complex, such as refueling, re-watering, shore power connections, berthing, ferry services, tugboat assistance, sludge disposal services and housing.\n\nThe 9 Naval Support Units are as follows:\n\nThe names of commissioned ships of the Philippine Navy are prefixed with the letters \"BRP\", designating \"\"Barko ng Republika ng Pilipinas\"\" (Ship of the Republic of the Philippines). The names of ships are often selected to honor important people and places. The Philippine Navy is currently operating 115 ships as follows:\n\n\nThe Naval Air Group has 25 naval air assets. It prepares and provides these forces for naval operations with assets mainly for maritime reconnaissance and support missions. Its headquarters is located at Danilo Atienza Air Base, Cavite City. It has four units which operates several variant of aircraft: 32nd Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Squadron (Beechcraft King Air C-90), Naval Aviation Squadron MF-30 (BN-2A Islander), Naval Aviation Squadron MH-40 (AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat, AgustaWestland AW109E Power, and MBB Bo 105C) and Naval Air School Center NATS-50 (Cessna Skyhawk 172M and Robinson R22 Beta II).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first two were against Bangladesh, the bottom-ranked test team. England started this series ranked second in the LG ICC Test Championship table.\n\nThe remaining tests were played for the Ashes against Australia, the top-ranked team in the world. The series is widely regarded as one of the best ever played.\n\nMichael Vaughan won the toss and put Bangladesh in to bat at 10.30am on the first day at Lord's. The first ten overs of bowling by Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard were lacklustre, as neither mastered the early-morning swing and they bowled a wide line. A stronger side would have scored more runs in this period, by Bangladesh made only 31 before losing their first wicket. Bangladesh captain, Habibul Bashar then came and went with suicidal hoick when he was on three. The rest of the team succumbed quickly, often to bad balls as they failed to adjust to the English conditions. The English mixed the odd good length ball with the short and wide stuff, inducing edges through to the slips at regular intervals – although, admittedly, the Bangladeshis would never have been out if they'd tried to play a bit more defensively.\n\nJaved Omar was the pick of the batsmen, scoring 22 before being caught by Marcus Trescothick off the most accurate of the English bowlers, Simon Jones. With six batsmen out in single figures, only Aftab Ahmed looked in control, before he also edged Andrew Flintoff to slip. In the end, Bangladesh made just 108 in 38.2 overs, despite being boosted by 12 English no-balls – eight from Hoggard, four from Harmison. Few batsmen even displayed the standard practice of getting behind a swinging ball and playing with a straight bat, preferring instead to stay still and nudge at the ball.\n\nMarcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss then batted to tea with composure, taking the boundaries off Test debutant Shahadat Hossain in particular, and the pair made 70 runs before tea – meaning that England were only 38 off with ten wickets in hand after two sessions. An hour after tea, England brought up the lead, with Strauss having notched his fifty despite looking slightly shaky against Anwar Hossain Monir bowling, and then being dropped on 51. Trescothick then made his fifty with a four off Mohammad Rafique. The opening partnership eventually was worth 148, as Strauss was nearly lbw on 69 with an inswinging ball on one ball and then finally lbw on the next, Mashrafe Mortaza getting rewards for his patient bowling.\n\nEngland, however, continued to paste the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan was lucky on more than one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. It was all too embarrassing for Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good as it got for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.\n\nBangladesh's reply was a sorry one. Yet again, they failed to play the short ball well enough, and lost five wickets – Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff the main culprits, taking two each – for a miserable 65 before Khaled Mashud and Aftab Ahmed took some responsibility and guided them to stumps with 95 for 5. It was not to last, though. Only six balls into the third day, Hoggard bowled a good off-cutter to Aftab Ahmed, who failed to play it properly and was hit on the pads – out for a fine 32, Bangladesh's highest score in the Test series so far.\n\nSteve Harmison then bowled the next over from the Pavilion End, removing spinner Rafique for a duck on his second ball of the over as he was caught behind and then having Mortaza bowled as Mortaza missed the ball only to have it graze his pad and roll behind him to hit his leg stump. Bangladesh had lost three wickets for two runs in the space of nine balls, and Harmison nearly added another wicket to his tally as he hit Anwar Hossain Monir on the pad in front. However, umpire Hariharan wasn't convinced it was going to hit the stumps, and Harmison was denied the hat-trick.\n\nThe end looked to be even more abrupt than people could think before the third day had started. However, a no-ball-aided recovery and some fine batting from wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud, who surpassed Aftab Ahmed's score, sent the match into a slow-death period. Anwar Hossain and Khaled Mashud did, however, manage to put on 58 together for the ninth wicket, Bangladesh's best partnership of the match. Simon Jones eventually broke through the defences, though, as Anwar Hossain Monir got a standard thick edge to first slip Trescothick, and thus the ninth wicket fell – 156 for 9. An over later, Khaled Mashud was finally out, giving an awkward edge off Andrew Flintoff's bowling to Graham Thorpe at short leg and ending the innings on 159 all out – giving England an innings and 261 run win just before noon, half an hour before lunch, on the third day. Gareth Batty – England's spin-bowler, who came in to replace the injured Ashley Giles – was only mentioned on the official scorecard once, as he did not bat, did not bowl, and did not hold a catch. Trescothick was named man of the match for his 194. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nMichael Vaughan won the toss again, just like in the first Test, and put Bangladesh into bat. A thoroughly professional bowling performance from the England bowlers followed, with Harmison, playing at his home ground, making the most of the conditions to take 5 wickets as the clearly outclassed Bangladeshis succumbed for 104. Only Javed Omar and Khaled Mashud made it into double figures. In reply, England quickly overcame the deficit for the loss of just Andrew Strauss, the only English batter who averaged less than 80 in this Test series. By close on the first day England were 269 for 3, with pundits reckoning the game would not reach the third day.\n\nOn the second day, Ian Bell became the first Englishman to score 100 before lunch in a Test match for 70 years, the last one being Les Ames, as both Bell and Thorpe hit out ahead of the predicted lunchtime declaration, which happened with England on 447 for 3. What followed was what the series had been crying out for earlier: a spirited Bangladeshi performance with proper cricketing shots. Whilst some Bangladeshis did get out to wild shots, the senior players got behind the ball, selected which ball to play, and made the most of the aggressive field placings chosen by England to make partnerships and build innings.\n\nFirst out was Nafees Iqbal, caught behind for 15 with the score on 50. Iqbal was unlucky, as the video replays suggested the ball had bounced before going into Geraint Jones's gloves, but despite returning to the pitch to appeal to the umpires, Iqbal had to go. Opener Javed Omar, captain Habibul Bashar and Aftab Ahmed all made half-centuries as it was touch and go as to whether England would wrap it up in the two days. When the seventh wicket fell at 245 in the last over of normal play, it allowed England to claim the extra half-hour. But only one more wicket fell as Bangladesh restored some pride. England wrapped up the game within 20 minutes on the third day, but Bangladesh, albeit against an attacking field had made 316, 27 short of making the hosts bat again.\n\nEngland therefore won the two Test series 2–0, taking both matches by more than an innings. This was their fifth successive Test series win, and the first time that the English had won five successive Test series since 1971. With their first three innings all being over before the Bangladeshis made 200, the series was clearly England's, who consolidated their position at second in the ICC Test Championship table. Bangladesh remain bottom in tenth place. Afterwards England captain Michael Vaughan said, \"It's difficult to judge how much we've got out of these games because we've won so easily. We've not had those real tough-in sessions and fight-through sessions where we've lost a batch of wickets. We have had stages when we had to knuckle down but it has been easier than I expected. To win two Test matches in almost two days each is obviously quite an easy series victory.\" (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nA low-scoring first day of cricket at Lord's included two batting collapses, first from Australia and then from England who got their go at batting just before tea. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and after Steve Harmison had shaken up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers, in particular one that had Justin Langer on the elbow, a procession of wickets began. Matthew Hoggard was inaccurate, but the early swing under the cloud suited him, and the ball that he did get on line swung between bat and pad to smash into Matthew Hayden's off stump. Australia still scored quickly, helped by aggressive field placings from England, but Harmison got the reward for short and pacy bowling when Ricky Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer, who had looked immaculate all morning and taken on the bowlers, was next to depart, Michael Vaughan getting reward with his bowling changes as Andrew Flintoff lured Langer into an expansive pull to Harmison at square-leg. And when Simon Jones was brought on in the sixteenth over, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn gone for 2. Another man came and went before lunch, Michael Clarke, and Australia were five down after the first session of play.\n\nAdam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all played a part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison – coming back for a second spell – wrapped them up with variations in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs – before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England a glimmer of hope, pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward edge off Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.\n\nEngland's difficulties continued in the morning. Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking twenty-one runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some streaky accumulation, pairing up for 33 – the fifth-highest partnership of the game thus far – to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.\n\nIn fact, the entire top order apart from Langer batted to high scores, but Clarke needed an extra life to do it. Pietersen dropped him on 21, with the Australian score 139 for 3, and instead of England getting the vital breakthrough Clarke and Martyn ran away with it, hitting 155 in 34.3 overs. Flintoff was smashed to all corners, and his figures read for 84 runs in nineteen overs, but England fought back late in the day – in the frantic last ten overs, started by an inside-edge from Clarke off Hoggard, Australia lost four wickets for 24 runs. However, Australia had gained a lead of 314 runs by the end of the second day, and still had Katich there on 10.\n\nFour overs into the morning, Ashley Giles returned what could arguably be said to be his most useful contribution of the match, having Brett Lee run out for 8. However, the always defensive Jason Gillespie proved too difficult to get out for England, Harmison menacing him with bouncers and yorkers but not managing it, and it was the quietly toiling Jones who finally got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off-stump – after having a number of catches dropped, one especially simple one by namesake Geraint. Glenn McGrath and Katich continued with a partnership of 43, as England was set what would be a world record 420 to win.\n\nThey started positively, riding their luck and good favour with the umpires – a number of lbw appeals were turned down both before and after tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic pace-man's short-ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, suggesting that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne just kept pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, there was nowhere to hide for England, and not even an unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.\n\nRain frustrated both Australia and neutral fans on the morning of the fourth day, but after four hours the sun finally broke through and the covers were taken off. It only took ten overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last – Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones all gone for ducks – as England could only add 24 runs, 22 of them from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after the first match.\n\nThe psychological battles before the match saw Australia planting many stories in the press about England already being in trouble. England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it would choose to bowl first and would win. England's mind games paid dividends when Ricky Ponting did just that, as Michael Vaughan admitted that if he had won the toss, he'd have batted, and as the match progressed, it became clearer and clearer that the pitch would take plenty of turn near the end.\n\nEngland took advantage of being inserted and came back strongly, especially considering the 239-run drubbing they had received at Lord's a couple of weeks earlier. The Australian bowlers were smashed to all corners on the first day as, for the first time in their 493-Test history, Australia conceded more than 400 runs in a first day of Test cricket. The English mentality seemed to be to attack from the outset, and it was helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match. During a warm-up (playing rugby), the pace-man accidentally stood on a cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and on a pitch where inaccurate bowling was immediately punished, McGrath's line and length would surely have been useful.\n\nInstead, Marcus Trescothick made innumerable smashes off Brett Lee to the cover boundary. Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie for his runs, and their 112-run opening partnership was the highest by England in the Ashes series so far this year – indeed, the second highest of the series thus far, only beaten by Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke's 155 at Lord's. They continued on their fine form from Lord's, where they had made 80 in the second innings, and the jitters from the one-day series seemed to have vanished with McGrath. Admittedly, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, but few remembered that as he crafted his way to 90 – being second out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2, after only 32.3 overs.\n\nEngland lost both Ian Bell, who continued his relatively poor Ashes series with his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee, in the space of the next five overs, but still pounded on. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit ten fours and one six, and forged a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff, which turned the match back to England's favour. Flintoff's 68 was scored quickly, including five sixes, and again Lee got the most stick – he was taken for 26 in the 18 balls he faced.\n\nLee did get one wicket, though, and Australia could have been forgiven for thinking it was the most important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England would have to get something extraordinary out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.\n\nHowever, the quick scoring and the first Test result led many people to believe that Australia would come back with a vengeance on the second day of the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The dismissal was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ricky Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid-off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.\n\nThe pair looked to close England's lead, but again the England bowlers intervened – this time in the shape of the invisible man in England's attack, Simon Jones, who got plenty of reverse swing and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's tail – thought to be strengthened by the absence of McGrath, were all dismissed for single-figure scores, Andrew Flintoff taking the two last men lbw with the two last balls, although there was some argument about the first dismissal.\n\nHowever, England got their 99-run lead and continued to hack away at the Australian bowlers before stumps. After Trescothick and Strauss had smashed boundaries at will against the seamers, Ponting brought on Warne in the seventh over, and Warne broke through with his second ball of the match – a leg break that came into the left-hander's stumps and broke them completely, and Strauss was bowled for 6. Nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard survived four balls to end the day – England still leading by 124, with nine wickets in hand.\n\nThe third day was just as exhilarating to spectators as the first two; a total of seventeen wickets fell as Shane Warne and Andrew Flintoff took centre stage in an enthralling contest. First up, however, it was Brett Lee, who shattered England with three quick wickets – Trescothick slashed at a wide delivery, skipper Vaughan disappointed yet again with the bat as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and Hoggard naturally had to go eventually – edging to Hayden in the slips for 1.\n\nEngland were shaken, with the score at 31 for 4, and with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen could consider himself lucky to survive, after a suggestion he had been caught first ball. He survived, and went on to make 20, only to be given out off a similar situation from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell steadied things somewhat, and there were hopes among England fans that Bell would make his first significant score against the tourists. Instead, he fell two overs after Pietersen, having given the tiniest of edges to Gilchrist for 21.\n\nSo, with the score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, this time from Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had suffered a shoulder injury and looked in obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave an edge to Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually felt the need to play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, and it was all up to Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.\n\nThat they did. Jones kept his head, managing 12 runs in his 42-minute stay at the crease with some streaky fours, while Flintoff smacked Lee everywhere. Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz, with one over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no-balls. At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, something rarely seen in cricket. One six hit by Flintoff landed on top of the stands. Flintoff ended with 73 – the only man to pass 25 for England – before being bowled by Warne. Warne finished with stunning figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end – but, as luck and Australia's batsmen would have it, his failure to get Flintoff out earlier would be crucial.\n\nMatthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking runs off the occasional bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and before anyone noticed, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were well on the way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came in to bowl his first over. The ball was hurled down the pitch, and swung enough to deceive the Australian batsmen – Flintoff got Langer and Ponting out in the same over, and Australia were struggling again, the score on 48 for 2.\n\nA few overs of relative calm followed, Hayden forging runs with Martyn but never looking too assured, and his dismissal, came in an over where Australia had actually looked on top. However, Simon Jones got the last laugh over Hayden – only to later be reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept muscling on, and despite never playing on top of their game they got four more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.\n\nAn extra half-hour of play was allowed, as a result was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne was lucky on more than one occasion, playing streaky shots that could easily have got him out, but he did smash Giles for 12 in one over. He was not out overnight – however, Steve Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slow delivery that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. England now only needed two wickets on the fourth day – Australia, however, needed 107 runs for the victory.\n\nOn the fourth day, Australia defied all predictions with a 45-run partnership between Warne and Lee, before Warne was forced back onto his stumps by Flintoff to get dismissed hit wicket. Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison. The pair had England on the back foot as their victory target neared closer and closer, edging virtually everything. With three to win, and three results possible, Harmison had Kasprowicz caught behind, with replays showing that the ball hit the batsman's hand when it was off the bat. If the hand had been on the bat, it would have been a correct decision – as it stood, it was incorrect to give him out. However, that mattered little to most viewers, who recognised the difficult job of the umpire. England were thus victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series very much alive. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nRather than engaging in the victory celebrations, the immediate reaction of Flintoff to the winning dismissal was to console the despondent batsmen—a gesture which was widely commented upon as indicative of the good sportsmanship and mutual respect between the teams which characterised the series.\n\nEngland's two run victory is the narrowest result in Ashes cricket history (there have been two Tests won by a margin of only three runs). It is also the second narrowest run victory in all Test cricket history. (other narrow victories given here)\n\nWith the series square after England's close win in the second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham, the stakes of the third Test at Old Trafford in Manchester had risen significantly. The day began with England winning the toss, and choosing to bat first, thus giving Shane Warne a chance to become the first man to take 600 Test wickets in England's first innings, and he did so against Marcus Trescothick who mistimed a sweep shot and was caught behind by Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, earning Warne a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nAfter naming an unchanged line-up, England were immediately faced by the pairing of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. There were doubts about whether these could play before the match started, due to injuries sustained earlier, but they both passed fitness tests. England's wickets fell slowly, with many a missed opportunity for Australia helping the hosts to run up a big first innings total. This was also helped by a fruitful partnership between Trescothick and Michael Vaughan, who added 137 before Trescothick was dismissed after lunch. Vaughan became the first man in the series to get a century.\n\nThe frustrated Australia team faced a fearless England side who challenged them at every turn, and recovered nicely even after the dismissals of Trescothick and Vaughan, who couldn't resist smacking a full toss from Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary. Vaughan was dismissed after 166 runs, which was destined to be the highest individual score in the series. Australia were also faced with a more defiant Ian Bell, who had struggled in the first two Tests. Picking up where Vaughan left off after tea, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed out the day for England with the score 341 for 5.\n\nBell did not add to his overnight score, being given out caught behind in controversial circumstances, as replays indicated he did not make contact with the ball. Following a brief rain interval England then lost two more wickets just before lunch, Andrew Flintoff after scoring a quick-fire 46 and Geraint Jones for 42. After lunch Australia quickly dispatched the remaining two wickets for just a further 10 runs, bowling England out for a score of 444, with Glenn McGrath finishing on his worst-ever Test figures of nought for 86.\n\nAustralia started their innings tentatively with Matthew Hoggard dropping a low catch Matthew Hayden off his own bowling. Just before tea Australia lost their first wicket with Hayden out caught at short leg from Ashley Giles first over. After tea Australia lost another couple of wickets, Ricky Ponting caught for seven and Hayden given out lbw for 34. Gilchrist put on 30 before edging the first ball of Simon Jones' spell to Geraint Jones.\n\nThis brought in Michael Clarke who had been recuperating at the team hotel after damaging his back on the first day. Due to this injury, Clarke needed Hayden to act as a runner. Warne made inroads with the bat, just like at Edgbaston four days previously, but Clarke only managed to add seven runs before being deceived by a slower ball from Simon Jones. Warne and Jason Gillespie saw the day out with Warne finishing on 45 not out.\n\nThe day finished with Australia on 214 for 7, 230 behind and needing another 31 runs to avoid a follow-on. The score was adjusted from 210 overnight due to an umpire failing to signal a four byes.\n\nRain delayed the start of play until 16:00 BST, and even then only 8 overs were possible before play was again suspended, although a further 6 overs were bowled later on before yet more rain meant that play was abandoned for the day. Australia had the better of the short day's play, adding 50 runs without loss to pass the follow-on target, although Warne was lucky to survive on two occasions thanks to errors by Geraint Jones: when Warne had 55 he missed a relatively straightforward stumping opportunity, and on 68 he was dropped after edging a ball from Flintoff. Australia closed on 264 for 7, still 180 in arrears, but England probably felt that they missed several opportunities to put the game beyond their opponents.\n\nHaving been hampered by a rain-shortened day three, the Australians were ready to put more wood to the ball on day four, and they did not disappoint. Warne continued his march towards his maiden Test century before holing out with a hook shot to a well placed Giles at 90. Simon Jones mopped up the other two wickets to bowl Australia out for 302, Jones finishing the innings with a career best figures of six for 53.\n\nThe English opening batsmen of Andrew Strauss and Marcus Trescothick began England's response, scoring 26 before lunch. After lunch, Trescothick played on to be bowled after scoring 41 giving McGrath his first wicket of the match. Strauss put together a fine century, his sixth from just 17 matches, scoring 106 before getting out caught. Gilchrist demonstrated how difficult wicket-keeping was by missing two stumping opportunities to remove Bell and failing to hold a catch to remove Flintoff. Bell capitalised on Gilchrist's errors, partnering Strauss for 28 overs and recording a well-deserved 65. Geraint Jones also added a swift 27 with England more concerned about scoring quickly than staying at the crease, and England declared on 280 to give them a spell at Australia in the evening and a chance of winning the match the next day. McGrath recorded another five-wicket haul in an innings, but was expensive, giving away 115 runs. Warne, despite bowling 25 overs, failed to take a wicket, recording figures of nought for 74.\n\nAustralia needed 423 to win, which would be a record fourth innings total to win a match. Australia saw out the last 10 overs without losing a wicket and put 24 runs, leaving 399.\n\nEnglish hopes of a win were high, and 20,000 people were locked out of the stadium in addition to the 23,000 capacity crowd. Australia started the day needing 399 runs from 98 overs if they were to claim an unlikely victory. The day started poorly for them with Langer falling for 14 on the seventh ball of the day, nicking a ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard behind to Geraint Jones. Ponting narrowly survived being run out early on and this proved crucial in the context of the match as the momentum gradually swung in Australia's direction. At one point Australia racked up runs at such a rate that a win became a real possibility. Despite losing Clarke and Jason Gillespie in quick succession to send the team to 264 for 7, Ponting battled on before eventually succumbing to Harmison after seven hours on the crease to record the first Australian century of the series with a score of 156. This was good enough to earn Man of the Match honours.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Ponting, Australia were 354 for 9 with only four overs remaining, and another thrilling climax occurred with England having a real chance of snatching victory in similar fashion to the second Test. However the unfancied pairing of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath handled the remaining 24 deliveries to finish on 371 for 9, 52 short of victory but sufficient to draw the game and leave the series tied at 1–1. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nGlenn McGrath was once again ruled out due to injury, this time to his elbow, and Australia also dropped the out-of-form Jason Gillespie, leaving them with a seam attack of Brett Lee, debutant Shaun Tait and Michael Kasprowicz. England, having been on top in the last two Tests, were unchanged.\n\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat, and they got off to a flyer. Boosted by no-balls from the seamers — a total of 18 before lunch — Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss made hay quickly, and enjoyed batting on a pitch which gave the bowlers no aid. They recorded their second 100-run opening partnership of the series, before Strauss was freakishly dismissed for 35, sweeping Shane Warne onto his boot and into Matthew Hayden's waiting hands at slip — a wicket confirmed by the third umpire. Michael Vaughan continued on his fine form from Old Trafford, though, punishing bad balls from Brett Lee to go into lunch with his score on 14. Trescothick, meanwhile, rode his luck, as he was bowled off a no-ball on 55, much to Lee's displeasure. At lunch England were 129 for 1.\n\nOnly 3.1 overs were possible in the afternoon session due to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Shaun Tait, who used the cloud cover to good effect and swung the ball well. However, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards the end of the day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket — that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.\n\nAustralia dismissed Pietersen at the beginning of the morning's play, edging a full outswinger from Lee through to wicket-keeper Gilchrist. But an unbeaten century partnership from Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones took England's score to 344 for 5 at lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, the pair continued to score quickly for another hour, and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit runs through the off side on the way to his highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones — including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off — saw England to 477 all out at tea.\n\nIn the evening session, England's bowlers, especially Matthew Hoggard, managed to find much more swing than the Australian bowlers had done, and ripped through the Australian top order. The first three wickets fell in a crucial period of 11 balls (although the third, which dismissed Damien Martyn lbw, was a debatable decision — television replays indicated that the ball might have hit the bat before the body). By stumps Australia had been reduced to 99 for 5 to complete an excellent day for England.\n\nSimon Katich and Adam Gilchrist decided that attack was the best form of defence, adding 58 in only 8.5 overs in the morning, before England came back to take the next four wickets for the addition of only 18 runs, leaving Australia perilously placed at 175 for 9. Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Brett Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Simon Jones's bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.\n\nMichael Vaughan then gambled, by enforcing the follow-on on the visitors (the first time Australia had followed on in 17 years). By lunch, Australia had reached 14 without loss in their second innings, and they powered on in the afternoon session, only losing Matthew Hayden and adding 100 more runs before tea. For England, the afternoon session was their worst of the match — to compound their misery, Simon Jones showed signs of injury, and Andrew Strauss dropped Justin Langer on 38.\n\nIn the evening session, England managed to take three wickets, but also dropped a catch and missed a stumping. Australia thus finished the day still 37 runs in arrears but with six wickets still in hand. Simon Jones also went off the field during the evening session with an ankle injury, and was taken to hospital for an ankle scan. While Jones was off the field receiving attention, substitute fielder Gary Pratt ran out Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who verbally expressed his displeasure at England's use of subs to the players, umpires and administrators as he left the field.\n\nDay Four began in earnest with Michael Clarke and Simon Katich continuing their partnership from the previous day. However, Katich had already twice flirted with dismissal, saved only by chance both times. In the words of BBC cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, \"It's very much a game of chess – white-flannelled figures on green grass.\" The English and the Australians proceeded into a cold war for a good part of the morning, with England attempting to frustrate the Australian batting, but with the latter refusing to take the bait. England's lead slowly evaporated without a wicket falling, but Matthew Hoggard's taking of Clarke's and then Adam Gilchrist's scalps on either side of the lunch break swung the initiative back into England's hands.\n\nThe injury to Simon Jones became somewhat obvious as the pacers struggled to capture the magic that Jones had created the previous day that had forced Australia to follow on. Despite this, the Australian run rate remained low as both sides stared each other down. Mistakes by Geraint Jones and Kevin Pietersen were quickly nullified by the dismissal of Warne for 45 and Kasprowicz for 19, and after a few overs' resistance Tait was bowled middle stump for 4, leaving 129 for the English to chase after tea.\n\nEngland then proceeded to send the game into a nailbiter — English wickets fell quickly as Shane Warne took four wickets (including those of Marcus Trescothick (27), Michael Vaughan (0) and Andrew Strauss (23)). Brett Lee dismissed Ian Bell (3) and at 57 for 4 England were in trouble. Andrew Flintoff (26) and Kevin Pietersen (23) then steadied the ship with an invaluable partnership of 46 before both fell in quick succession to Lee. Despite Geraint Jones (3) being dismissed cheaply, the partnership of Ashley Giles (7) and Matthew Hoggard (8) guided the English home. Man of the match honours went to Andrew Flintoff, but more importantly this gave the English a crucial 2–1 edge heading back to London for the fifth and final Test, ensuring that they could not lose the series. However, with the Ashes going to Australia in the event of a drawn series, there was still all to play for at The Oval.\n\n(BBC Scorecard)<br>\nAshes Reactions from the public (last day)\n\nAustralia named Glenn McGrath, recovered from an elbow injury, to replace Michael Kasprowicz. England's Simon Jones did not recover from his ankle injury from the previous Test in time to be included in the England team, and was replaced after much speculation by all-rounder Paul Collingwood, in preference to specialist fast bowler James Anderson.\n\nThe final match to decide the fate of the legendary Ashes urn finally began, and the proverbial first blood was drawn by England as Michael Vaughan won his third toss of the series (much to the delight of the Brit Oval crowd). Vaughan elected to have his English side to bat first, and the English first innings got underway. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 82 for the first wicket, as England's batsmen looked to take on the Australians, but subtle spin variations bowled from Shane Warne yielded three wickets as England went to lunch on 115 for 3.\n\nShane Warne continued after lunch by taking the wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Andrew Strauss, before to falling to Glenn McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his 2nd century of the series, before being dismissed by Shane Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was thought, might wipe up to a day of action or more from the ledger.\n\nDay two began positively for the Australians, with Jones being bowled for 25 off Brett Lee, and Matthew Hoggard managing a meagre 2 before being dismissed by McGrath. However, Ashley Giles and Steve Harmison frustrated the Australians by taking the score past 370, before Warne trapped Giles lbw shortly before midday, leaving England all out for 373.\n\nThe Australian first innings got off to a solid start, with Justin Langer forging a 100 partnership with fellow opener Matthew Hayden — the first opening-partnership century of the series by the Australian cricket team. Langer played some blistering strokes off Giles' bowling in particular, but survived a sharp chance to Marcus Trescothick at first slip. The Australians were offered the light immediately after tea, despite the English protesting and wanting to bowl Giles. The Australians accepted it, and the light never improved, with light rain coming down later. Thus, the day concluded with Australia 112/0, 261 runs behind England.\n\nAfter a delay for wet field conditions, the third day began with a flurry of action, as both Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays suggested should have been out, and shies at the stumps that just missed. However, no batsman was given out in the morning session, where only 14 overs of play was possible due to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.\n\nAfter lunch Hayden and Langer continued their solid batting, frustrating the England bowlers, with Langer reaching his 22nd Test century. Shortly afterwards, England gained a minor victory as Harmison dismissed Justin Langer, who departed to a rapturous ovation. Ricky Ponting should then have been dismissed for a bat-pad catch off Giles, but Bowden turned down the appeal. Hayden also achieved three-figure success later in the day, while Flintoff's hostile and accurate bowling was rewarded with the wicket of Ricky Ponting, caught at slip by Strauss. With this wicket, Andrew Flintoff equalled Ian Botham's hitherto unique achievement of 300 runs and 20 wickets in an Ashes series. Flintoff had a later appeal for a catch behind turned down by Rudi Koertzen, despite it hitting the bat.\n\nThe Australian batsmen once again ended the day early by accepting an offer of bad light, bringing a much-interrupted day to a close after only 45.4 overs. Thanks to dogged batting and at least four umpiring decisions in their favour on the third day, they finished 96 runs behind with eight wickets of their first innings intact.\n\nThe fourth day started brightly for England, Damien Martyn hooking a short ball from Flintoff straight into the hands of Collingwood, in the third over of the day, having added only one to his overnight score of nine. Further wickets fell, with an excellent knock by Matthew Hayden been brought to an end by Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff continued with impetus and trapped Simon Katich lbw for 1, before Hoggard had Adam Gilchrist lbw with an inswinger at the stroke of lunch. Gilchrist, however, had added a quick 23 that could be vital, as Australia went into the pavilion 17 runs behind with four wickets in hand.\n\nHowever, it only took six post-lunch overs for England to end the Australian effort. Geraint Jones dropped a catch off Michael Clarke's bat, but it did not prove to be crucial, as Clarke was lbw to Hoggard in the next over. Warne and McGrath both went for ducks, caught off a mistimed hook and in the slips respectively. Finally Hoggard had Brett Lee (6) caught in the deep and Australia were bowled out for 367. Flintoff finished with five wickets, the second five-for of his career, while Hoggard's four for 97 was his best return of the series.\n\nThus England, who had expected to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took a very quick wicket, that of Andrew Strauss, who was dismissed again by Shane Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play due to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.\n\nBBC day four synopsis\n\nThe fifth day began with the game still finely balanced. Ponting put his trust in his two proven wicket takers – McGrath and Warne. England batted well for forty minutes, with Vaughan taking the game to the Australian bowlers, but McGrath produced two beautiful outswingers to dismiss him and Ian Bell with consecutive deliveries. The Australian charge was diminished by a couple of uncharacteristic dropped catches, but Warne and McGrath combined to take 4 wickets before lunch, leaving England 133 runs ahead with 5 wickets remaining.\n\nThe afternoon session was anchored by Pietersen, the beneficiary of three dropped catches, who scored his maiden Test century, with obdurate support from Collingwood and Giles. The session saw only two wickets fall, Collingwood was caught acrobatically by silly mid-off Ponting for 10, and Geraint Jones (1) decisively bowled when he was deceived by a rapid Tait delivery. Pietersen was finally dismissed for 158, a superlative innings including 15 fours and 7 sixes, while Ashley Giles added 59 and Steve Harmison was dismissed for a duck to bring Australia into bat with less than 19 overs remaining.\n\nAs the Australians began their innings, it was clear that not enough time remained for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing-rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes for the first time since 1987.\n\nKevin Pietersen, having scored his maiden Test century at a crucial point, was voted Man of the Match by Channel 4 viewers. Andrew Flintoff was chosen by Australian coach John Buchanan as English Man of the Series while English coach Duncan Fletcher selected Shane Warne as the Australian Man of the Series. The new Compton-Miller Award for the overall man of the series (as selected by each side's chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns and David Graveney) was also presented to Andrew Flintoff. Finally, the replica urn was presented to jubilant English skipper Michael Vaughan, thus ending the series in favour of the home side.\n\nThe next series, scheduled for 2006–2007, will be played in Australia with England defending the Ashes.\n"}

It has edible fruit, referred to by the same name.\n\nThe tree is small to medium in size, reaching in height. The branchlets are not glabrous or finely pubescent, long, usually deciduous; the leaves are simple, subsessile and closely set along branchlets, light green, resembling pinnate leaves. The flowers are greenish-yellow. The fruit is nearly spherical, light greenish-yellow, quite smooth and hard on appearance, with six vertical stripes or furrows.\n\nRipening in autumn, the berries are harvested by hand after climbing to upper branches bearing the fruits. The taste of Indian emblic is sour, bitter and astringent, and it is quite fibrous.\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, half an amalaka fruit was the final gift to the Buddhist sangha by the great Indian emperor Ashoka. This is illustrated in the Ashokavadana in the following verses: \"A great donor, the lord of men, the eminent Maurya Ashoka, has gone from being lord of Jambudvipa [the continent] to being lord of half a myrobalan\"\n(Strong, 1983, p. 99). In Theravada Buddhism, this plant is said to have been used as the tree for achieving enlightenment, or Bodhi, by the twenty first Buddha, named Phussa Buddha.\n\nPratapgarh is one of the largest producers and suppliers of Indian gooseberries. In this region, the fruit is commonly pickled with salt, oil, and spices. The amla fruit is eaten raw or cooked into various dishes. In Pratapgarh, tender varieties are used to prepare \"dal\" (a lentil preparation), and \"amle ka murabbah\", a sweet dish made by soaking the berries in sugar syrup until they are candied. It is traditionally consumed after meals.\n\nIn the Batak area of Sumatra, Indonesia, the inner bark is used to impart an astringent, bitter taste to the broth of a traditional fish soup known as \"holat\".\n\nIn traditional Indian medicine, dried and fresh fruits of the plant are used. All parts of the plant are used in various Ayurvedic medicine herbal preparations, including the fruit, seed, leaves, root, bark and flowers. According to Ayurveda, amla fruit is sour (\"amla\") and astringent (\"kashaya\") in taste (\"rasa\"), with sweet (\"madhura\"), bitter (\"tikta\") and pungent (\"katu\") secondary tastes (\"anurasas\"). Its qualities (\"gunas\") are light (\"laghu\") and dry (\"ruksha\"), the postdigestive effect (\"vipaka\") is sweet (\"madhura\") and its energy (\"virya\") is cooling (\"shita\").\n\nIn Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations, Indian gooseberry is a common constituent, and most notably is the primary ingredient in an ancient herbal \"rasayana\" called \"Chyawanprash\".\n\nCommonly used in inks, shampoos and hair oils, the high tannin content of Indian gooseberry fruit serves as a mordant for fixing dyes in fabrics.\n\nThese fruits are reputed to contain high amounts of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and have bitter taste that may derive from a high density of ellagitannins, such as emblicanin A (37%), emblicanin B (33%), punigluconin (12%), and pedunculagin (14%).

She was one of the main attractions of the Maritime Museum Rotterdam, also known as the Prince Hendrik Museum, named after its founder, Prince Henry (Hendrik) \"The Navigator\", who had a naval career and established the basis of the museum back in 1874. In October 2013 the ship moved to Hellevoetsluis and is again open for public.\n\nBuilt in 1868 by Robert Napier and Sons in Glasgow, Scotland, HNLMS \"Buffel\" was the first ship of the Royal Netherlands Navy without sails but with a steam engine and two propellers, that gave her a maximum speed of almost . Her radius of action at was about . Her main task as an armor-clad ram ship was to play a role in the Dutch coastal defense together with two sister ships and two so-called monitor ships.\n\nHer armament was first of all the ram on her bow, mainly against wooden ships, and originally two , Armstrong guns, with a total weight of 25 metric tons, in one turret. These were later replaced by a single gun, and the armament was enhanced by a couple of smaller guns; two , four , and two Hotchkiss revolving cannons.\n\nThe crew consisted of 150 men, officers, petty-officers, and sailors.\n\nThe ship's only ocean voyage took place on her maiden trip in 1868 from Glasgow to Den Helder. During the voyage, the vessel rolled very much and took on a lot of water. From that day on \"Buffel\" remained in the North Sea (in accordance with her role) and her only foreign port of call was Antwerp, Belgium in 1871.\n\n\"Buffel\" participated in many national exercises with the Royal Netherlands Army until 1894 when she was retired from active duty. This was followed by a short, two-year period as a training ship for and from 1896 she acted as a lodging or accommodation ship. She was berthed in several naval establishments in the Netherlands, the last 25 years mainly in Amsterdam. She had the (NATO) pennant number A 884 on her bow, A for Auxiliary and 8 as the first cipher for all Royal Netherlands naval ships.\n\nIn 1973 \"Buffel\" was decommissioned. In 1974, the vessel was sold to the city of Rotterdam to be modified into a museum ship. From 1979 she was opened for visitors. The ship was moved to Hellevoetsluis in 2013 in order to cut costs. \"Buffel\" arrived in Hellevoetsluis on 5 October and was moored temporarily in the brick-built Jan Blanken dry dock. This was all done on a three-year lease. On 7 February 2015 she arrived at her final berthing place at the Koningskade 2, in Het Groote Dock in Hellevoetsluis where a historic naval quarter has been developed.

The ship is now operated by volunteers from Stichting Museumschip de Buffel.\n\nIn October 2016 Stichting Museumschip de Buffel decided not to renew the three year lease. The group of volunteers then took up the idea to try to save the historical value of the ship for the future.

It is a cross between a serval and a domestic cat.\n\nThe Savannah cat is the largest of the cat breeds. A Savannah cat is a cross between a domestic cat and a serval, a medium-sized, large-eared wild African cat. The unusual cross became popular among breeders at the end of the 1990s, and in 2001 The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted it as a new registered breed. In May 2012, TICA accepted it as a championship breed.\n\nJudee Frank crossbred a male serval, belonging to Suzi Woods, with a Siamese (domestic cat) to produce the first Savannah cat (named Savannah) on April 7, 1986. \nIn 1996, Patrick Kelley and Joyce Sroufe wrote the original version of the Savannah breed standard and presented it to the board of The International Cat Association. In 2001, the board accepted the breed for registration. The Savannah cat can come in different colors and patterns, however, The International Cat Association (TICA) breed standards only accept spotted patterns with certain colors and color combinations.\n\nThe Savannahs' tall and slim build give them the appearance of greater size than their actual weight. Size is very dependent on generation and sex, with F1 hybrid male cats usually being the largest.\n\nF1 and F2 generations are usually the largest, due to the stronger genetic influence of the African serval ancestor. As with other hybrid cats such as the Chausie and Bengal cat, most first generation cats will possess many or all of the serval's exotic looking traits, while these traits often diminish in later generations. Male Savannahs tend to be larger than females.\n\nEarly-generation Savannahs can weigh , with the most weight usually attributed to the F1 or F2 neutered males due to genetics. Later-generation Savannahs are usually between . Because of the random factors in Savannah genetics, size can vary significantly, even in one litter.\n\nThe coat of a Savannah should have a spotted pattern, the only pattern accepted by the TICA breed standard. The spotted pattern is the only accepted pattern because it is the only pattern found on the African Serval Cat. Non-standard patterns & colors include: Rosetted, marble, snow color (point), blue color, cinnamon color, chocolate color, lilac (lavender) and other diluted colors derived from domestic sources of cat coat genetics.\n\nThe International Cat Association (TICA) breed standard calls for brown-spotted tabby (cool to warm brown, tan or gold with black or dark brown spots), silver-spotted tabby (silver coat with black or dark grey spots), black (black with black spots), and black smoke (black-tipped silver with black spots) only.\n\nDomestic out-crosses from the early days in the 1990s have greatly impacted the breed's development in both desired and non-desired traits. As of 2012 most breeders perform Savannah to Savannah pairings; using out-crosses is considered less than desired. There are no longer any permitted domestic out-crosses for the Savannah breed now that TICA championship status has been achieved. Previously domestic out-crosses for the Savannah breed that were permissible in TICA were the Egyptian Mau, the Ocicat, the Oriental Shorthair, and the Domestic Shorthair.\n\nOutcrosses that are \"impermissible\" according to the TICA breed standard breeds include the Bengal and Maine Coon cats. These impermissible breeds can bring many unwanted genetic influences. Outcrosses are very rarely used as of 2012, as many fertile savannah males are available for studs. Breeders prefer to use a Savannah with the serval to produce F1s, rather than a non-Savannah breed in order to maintain as much breed type as possible.\n\nA Savannah's exotic look is often due to the presence of many distinguishing serval characteristics. Most prominent of these include the various color markings; tall, deeply cupped, wide, rounded, erect ears; very long legs; fat, puffy noses, and hooded eyes. The bodies of Savannahs are long and leggy; when a Savannah is standing, its hind-end is often higher than its prominent shoulders. The small head is taller than wide, and it has a long, slender neck. The backs of the ears have ocelli, a central light band bordered by black, dark grey or brown, giving an eye-like effect. The short tail has black rings, with a solid black tip. The eyes are blue as a kitten (as in other cats), and may be green, brown, gold or a blended shade as an adult. The eyes have a \"boomerang\" shape, with a hooded brow to protect them from harsh sunlight. Ideally, black or dark \"tear-streak\" or \"cheetah tear\" markings run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose to the whiskers, much like that of a cheetah.\n\nAs Savannahs are produced by crossbreeding servals and domestic cats, each generation of Savannahs is marked with a filial number. For example, the cats produced directly from a serval/domestic cat cross are termed F1, and they are 50% serval.\n\nF1 generation Savannahs are very difficult to produce, due to the significant difference in gestation periods between the serval and a domestic cat (75 days for a serval and 65 days for a domestic cat), and sex chromosomes. Pregnancies are often absorbed or aborted, or kittens are born prematurely. Also, servals can be very picky in choosing mates, and often will not mate with a domestic cat.\n\nF2 Savannahs can be as high as 75% serval. All 75% F1s (technically a backcross, or BC1) are the offspring of a 50% F1 (true F1) female bred back to a serval. Cases of 87.5% F1 (technically BC2) Savannah cats are known, but fertility is questionable at those percentage Serval levels. More common than a 75% F1 is a 62.5% F1, which is the product of an \"F2A\" (25% serval, female) bred back to a serval. The F2 generation, which has a serval grandparent and is the offspring of the F1 generation female, ranges from 25% to 37.5% serval. The F3 generation has a serval great grandparent, and is at least 12.5% Serval.\n\nA Savannah cross may also be referred to by breeders as \"SV xSV\" (SV is the TICA code for the Savannah breed), in addition to the filial number. Savannah generation filial numbers also have a letter designator that refers to the generation of SV-to-SV breeding. The designation A means one parent is a Savannah and the other is an outcross. B is used for both parents are Savannahs with one of them being an A. The C designation is when both parents are Savannahs and one of them is a B. Therefore, A x (any SV) = B; B x (B,C,SBT) = C; C x (C, SBT) = SBT, SBT x SBT = SBT. F1 generation Savannahs are always A, since the father is a nondomestic outcross (the serval father). The F2 generation can be A or B. The F3 generation can be A, B or C. The F4 generation is the first generation that can be a \"stud book tradition\" (SBT) cat, and is considered \"purebred\".\n\nBeing hybrids, Savannahs typically exhibit some characteristics of hybrid inviability. Because the male Savannah is the heterogametic sex, they are most commonly affected, in accordance with Haldane's rule. Male Savannahs are typically larger in size and sterile until the F5 generation or so, although the females are fertile from the F1 generation. As of 2011, breeders were noticing a resurgence in sterility in males at the F5 and F6 generations. Presumably, this is due to the higher serval percentage in C and SBT cats. The problem may also be compounded by the secondary nondomestic genes coming from the Asian leopard cat in the Bengal outcrosses that were used heavily in the foundation of the breed.\n\nFemales of the F1-F3 generations are usually held back for breeding, with only the males being offered as pets. The reverse occurs in the F5-F7 generations, but to a lesser degree, with the males being held as breeding cats, and females primarily offered as pets.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>The cats are known for their loyalty, and they will follow their owners around the house. They can also be trained to walk on a leash and to fetch.\n\nSome Savannahs are reported to be very social and friendly with new people and other cats and dogs, while others may run and hide or revert to hissing and growling when seeing a stranger. Exposure to other people and pets is most likely the key factor in sociability as Savannah kittens grow up.\n\nAn often-noted trait of the Savannah is its jumping ability. They are known to jump on top of doors, refrigerators and high cabinets. Some Savannahs can leap about 8 feet (2.5 m) high from a standing position. Savannahs are very inquisitive. They often learn how to open doors and cupboards, and anyone buying a Savannah will likely need to take special precautions to prevent the cat from getting into trouble.\n\nMany Savannah cats do not fear water, and will play or even immerse themselves in water. Some owners even shower with their Savannah cats. Presenting a water bowl to a Savannah may also prove a challenge, as some will promptly begin to \"bat\" all the water out of the bowl until it is empty, using their front paws.\n\nAnother quirk Savannahs have is to fluff out the base of their tails in a greeting gesture. This behavior is not to be confused with the fluffing of fur along the back and full length of the tail in fear. Savannahs will also often flick or wag their tails in excitement or pleasure.\n\nVocally, Savannahs may either chirp like their serval fathers, meow like their domestic mothers, both chirp and meow, or sometimes produce sounds which are a mixture of the two. Chirping is observed more often in earlier generations. Savannahs may also \"hiss\" – a serval-like hiss, quite different from a domestic cat's hiss – sounding more like a very loud snake. It can be alarming to humans not acquainted to such a sound coming from a cat.\n\nThere are three basic factors that affect the character of the Savannah cat behavior: lineage, generation, and socialization. These three factors all follow the nature and nurture argument with nature being breed lines combined with generation and nurture being social upbringing. the Savannah breed development is still in its infancy and most Savannah cats have a very broad range of behaviors.\n\nIf a breed line has a tendency for a specific behavior over other behaviors it is likely to be passed to the breed lines offspring. As outside lines are used there is a merging effect of the base behaviors.\n\nWhen breeding lines starting from early generations such as first filial and second filial generations (F1 and F2 Savannahs), behavior stemming from the wild out cross, the Serval, is more apparent. Behaviors like jumping, fight or flight instincts, dominance, and nurturing behaviors are more noticeable in early generations. Since fertile males that are F5 and F6 are used in most breeding programs, later generation Savannah cats behaviors tend to act more like traditional domestic cats. Overlying behavior traits for all generations are high activity and high curiosity.\n\nProbably the most influential factor is early socialization. Kittens can be socialized with human contact from birth, and human interaction each day reinforces kitten and cat human interaction behavior that lasts throughout the cats' life span. Kittens within litters will tend to have varied social skills, with some that like human interaction and others that fear it. If kittens that fear humans never grow past that fear they will tend to exhibit a more shy behavior and are likely to hide when strangers are present. Kittens that look forward to human visits and likely to engage in play with humans tend to grow to cats that are more welcoming of strangers and less frightened of new environments. These cats tend to become the life of the party versus a cat that will find a hiding place until the party is over. Human cat socialization should be practiced each day with positive reinforcement for a kitten to grow into a well-rounded social Savannah cat. Kittens that go for long periods of time without human interaction and only interact with their mothers or siblings usually do not develop a strong bond with humans and tend to be less trusting of humans. These kittens tend to be shy and are likely to hide when unknown people are present.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a health concern in many pure breed cats. A link has recently been found between Bengal cat (a similar hybrid) and HCM there are cases that indicate that HCM may also be a reoccurring health issue in servals. Several responsible Bengal Breeders have their breeder cats scanned for HCM on an annual basis, though this practice is not as widespread in the Savannah community.\n\nSome veterinarians have noted servals have smaller livers relative to their body sizes than domestic cats, and some Savannahs inherit this, but the medical consequence of this is unrecognized and is likely to be of no consequence. There are no known medical peculiarities of hybrid cats requiring different medical treatments than that of domestic cats, despite what many breeders may believe. The blood values of Savannahs are not known to be different from the typical domestic cat, despite its serval genes.\n\nLike domestic cats, Savannahs and other domestic hybrids (such as Bengals) require appropriate anesthesia based on their medical needs but do not have specific requirements as breeders sometimes erroneously infer. It is unclear among the veterinary community how a particular anesthetic agent, specifically ketamine, has been listed as causing ill effects when this has not been found to be accurate. It is possible this comes from a misunderstanding of the drug and its common effects, since ketamine is an anesthetic that cannot be used alone.\n\nKetamine has been proven safe, when used in servals, together with medetomidine (Domitor, Dorbene, Dormilan, Medetor, Sedastart, Sedator, Sededorm) and butorphanol (Alvegesic, Dolorex, Torbugesic, Torbutrol, Torphasol) with the antagonist atipamezole (Alzane, Antisedan, Atipam, Revertor, Sedastop).\n\nIn the United States, rabies vaccines are recommended but not approved for non-domestic cats. If a non-domestic cat bites someone it will be treated as \"unvaccinated\" whether it has been given a vaccine or not. This means a state veterinarian may require a cat who has bitten someone to be euthanized or quarantined according to state laws.\n\nSome breeders state Savannah cats have no known special care or food requirements, while others recommend a very high quality diet with no grains or byproducts. Some recommend a partial or complete raw feeding/raw food diet with at least 32% protein and no byproducts. Some recommend calcium and other supplements, especially for growing cats and earlier generations. Others consider it unnecessary, or even harmful. Most Savannah breeders agree that Savannahs have a need for more taurine than the average domestic cat, and therefore recommend taurine supplements, which can be added to any food type.\n\nLaws governing ownership of Savannah cats in the United States vary according to state. The majority of states follow the code set by the United States Department of Agriculture, which defines wild or domesticated hybrid crosses as domesticated. Some states have set more restrictive laws on hybrid cat ownership, including Hawaii, Massachusetts, Texas and Georgia. Some cities may have laws that differ from the state. For example, Savannahs more than five generations from the serval are allowed to be owned in New York state, but not in the city of New York.\n\nThe Australian Federal government has banned the importation into Australia of the Savannah cat, as the larger cats could potentially threaten species of the country's native wildlife not threatened by smaller domestic cats. A government report on the proposed importation of the cats has warned the hybrid breed may introduce enhanced hunting skills and increased body size into feral cat populations, putting native species at risk. The report states the Savannah cats are not worth the risk.\n\nSavannah cats are legal in every province of Canada, although some provinces have restrictions on the ownership of F1 and F2 generations, and importing Savannahs from the United States requires rabies vaccination and special permits.\n\nMany other nations have few or no restrictions on F2 and later generations.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the northeastern part of the Chagos Archipelago, near Speakers Bank and Blenheim Reef. The reef is 8 km long, and measures 1 to 2 km across. Breakers are visible only during heavy seas.\n\nThis submerged atoll is named after Alden Partridge Colvocoresses who in the 1970s together with John P. Snyder and John L. Junkins developed the Space-oblique Mercator projection.\n\nThe least charted depth is above the reef. This sounding was one of only a few that were ever incorporated into US nautical charts, having been derived not from sonar or lead line data, but from radiometric data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery.\n\nColvocoresses Reef is unique in that it was discovered by use of images taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Landsat Satellite (Originally called Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS). Note that these early Landsat images covered a footprint on the surface of the earth of about on a side. They also had a picture element (pixel) footprint of and could only detect features near that size. The original Landsat Multispectral Scanners (MSS) (On Landsat/ERTS 1-5) imaged the earth with several spectral bands. Each band provides a black-and-white image that is taken through a spectral filter. It has two non-thermal infrared bands for sensing plant vigor. These bands have very limited water penetration. Landsat also has two visible wavelength bands: red and green. Although the red band penetrates clear water to only about , the green band has been proven to see through clear ocean waters to depths of about . Since light is exponentially attenuated through the water column, given clear water and similar bottom reflectances, deeper water will appear darker on the Landsat images.\n\nThe original depth data for the shallow water areas on Chagos Archipelago nautical charts had been collected in the mid-1830s. Except for the areas around Diego Garcia, much of the data on the current small scale charts of the archipelago is from the 1830s data. In 1975, the Defense Mapping Agency's Hydrographic Center, subsequently incorporated into the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), requested NASA to collect Landsat images over the Chagos Archipelago. The images revealed the previously uncharted Colvocoresses Reef as well as errors in positioning of numerous other reefs in the Archipelago. Some were out of position by as much as .\n\nBy the summer of 1976 a new edition of the Chagos Archipelago nautical chart (#61610) was printed showing the corrected positions of the banks and shoals as well as Colvocoresses Reef. This was the first nautical chart known to have been completely revised using the Landsat imagery. The link at footnote #6 goes to an article that describes the updating of the chart from Landsat and shows images, old and new charts.\n\nThe brightness of the reef was compared with the brightness of other reefs that had known depths and similar bottom reflections. It was deemed advisable to give in a notice to mariners a probable depth range for the reef with a caution on the chart that there were probably shallower features on the reef.\n\n\n"}

Sigismund was rumored to be expected to become his successor on the Polish throne. Being just an adolescent, he commanded his own banner of the Army of the Crown in the victorious Battle of Grunwald in 1410.\n\nHis elder sister, Olena (Helena) had been married to an important magnate of Bohemian kingdom, duke Jan of Opava and Ratiborz.\n\nAs a regent of Bohemia for Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas, he was commissioned to lead his army to Bohemia in April 1422. The army of Sigismund of Hungary retreated to Hungary in avoidance of the encounter. Sigismund Korybut arrived in Prague on 16 May 1422, and was acknowledged ruler of Bohemia. He became commander of local Hussites, and fought in Hussite internal disputes. Pope Martin V insisted that Vytautas and Jogaila recall Sigismund from Bohemia. On 24 December 1423, under Jogaila's agreement with Sigismund of Hungary, Sigismund Korybut left Prague with his army.\n\nHowever, he could not refuse an offer of the Bohemian throne and on 29 June 1424 he once again came to Prague with 1,500-strong army, this time without Vytautas' and Jogaila's consent; their primary objective had been a successful implementation of the Treaty of Melno, thus a conflict with Sigismund of Hungary was undesirable. Therefore, Jogaila ordered a confiscation of Sigismund's estates, and the Papal legate excommunicated him. Meanwhile, as a governor of Prague, he dismissed the city's council, summoned a new one and succeed in ending the internal discords between Jan Žižka and the Utraquists, enabling a successful Hussite military campaign to Moravia against Emperor Sigismund. After Žižka's death, he became a supreme commander of his army, leading it to victory in the Battle of Usti nad Labem on 16 June 1426.\n\nSigismund Korybut began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary, with an intention to reconcile the Catholics and Hussites. However, his political career came to an end in 1427, when by the initiative of suspicious Prague Taborites, he was imprisoned in Valdštejn Castle for the organization of a revolt in Prague. After release from prison in 1428, Sigismund participated in Taborite battles in Silesia. The decisive loss in the Battle of Lipany forced him to return to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nSigismund Korybut was among the commanders in the Battle of Pabaiskas on the side of his uncle Švitrigaila on 1 September 1435. His army was decisively defeated by Sigismund Kęstutaitis' forces. Sigismund Korybut was wounded during the battle, however he fought till the end. According to Jan Długosz, the cause of his death was severe infection of his wounds (\"extremo mortis horrendae supplicio\").\n\n\n\n"}

She was outfitted with powerful 8-inch guns and assigned, as a gunboat, to the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America.\n\n\"Varuna\", the first U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was originally intended for merchant service between New York City and New Orleans. She was laid down in late January or early February 1861 at the Mallory Yard, Mystic, Connecticut; launched there in the following September; and purchased by the Navy at New York City on 31 December 1861.\n\nOn 10 February 1862, she was ordered to remain in New York until \"Monitor\" was ready for action so that she might escort the new ironclad from New York to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to protect the wooden-hulled Union blockaders there from the Southern armored ram, CSS \"Virginia\".\n\nHowever, these orders were revoked later that same day; and \"Varuna\" was assigned to the newly established West Gulf Blockading Squadron. En route south late in February, \"Varuna\" put into Port Royal, South Carolina, for repairs, where the ship's commanding officer, Commander Charles S. Boggs, assumed temporary command of the harbor on 24 February during Flag Officer Samuel F. Du Pont's absence. The gunboat finally joined Rear Admiral David G. Farragut's West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 6 March.\n\nOn 24 April 1862, \"Varuna\" was with the squadron during Farragut's daring nighttime dash past Confederate works guarding the Mississippi below New Orleans – Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip.\n\nAt the height of the melee, \"Varuna\" was rammed twice by the steamer CSS \"Governor Moore\" and struck twice again immediately thereafter by the cotton-clad ram CSS \"Stonewall Jackson\". After striking \"Varuna\", CSN Lt. Beverly Kennon, in command of one of the Confederate warships, \"Governor Moore\" – found himself unable to depress his guns far enough to fire upon the Union vessel. So he shot through the bow of his own ship and used the resulting hole as a gun port.\n\nFatally damaged, \"Varuna\" backed off from the Confederate vessels and continued to subject them to a withering fire until rising water silenced her guns. Eight sailors of the \"Varuna\" received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle: Seaman Thomas Bourne, Landsman Amos Bradley, Captain of the Forecastle John Greene, Third Class Boy George Hollat, Seaman William Martin, Quartermaster John McGowan, Coxswain William McKnight, and Second Class Boy Oscar E. Peck.\n\nRear Admiral Farragut's stunning victory at and subsequent capture of New Orleans itself electrified the North. \"Varuna's\" part in the Union triumph was soon commemorated in George Henry Boker's poem, \"The Varuna\", which appeared in the \"Philadelphia Press\" on 12 May.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954056", "title": "Valiant tank", "text": "Valiant tank\n\nThe Tank, Infantry, Valiant (A38) was a British tank design of the Second World War that only reached the prototype stage. Intended to meet the specification for a lightweight but heavily armoured tank for use in the war in the Far East, it proved to be a failure. The sole example was retained by the School of Tank Technology after the war as a lesson to its students.\n\nThe Valiant, under General Staff specification A38, began as a candidate for an assault tank, with the thickest armour on the lowest possible weight, for use in the Far East. It was to be similar in intention to the 40-ton A33 Excelsior although far lighter. As the Valiant managed the same 114 mm frontal armour with only 27 tons, it managed to achieve its primary goal, but only by making unacceptable compromises elsewhere. At a time when British tank design was already at its nadir, this \"terrible price for the weight concession\" led to what is probably the worst British tank of the war.\n\nThe design brief of December 1943 called for three prototypes of a small, heavily armoured tank for the Far East. Speed across open country was less important, as was performance against armour. Design work started with Vickers, but they soon passed it to Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon, then finally Ruston & Hornsby, who built the single prototype in 1944. Vickers' original intention may have been to use parts of their Valentine infantry tank where possible, but this did not survive the production choices of the other manufacturers, nor was the running gear of the far lighter Valentine compatible with the needs of such heavy armour. The largest point of commonality was the choice of engine, the 210 bhp General Motors 6004 two-stroke diesel, as used in later marks of Valentine.\n\nConstruction was like that of the Matilda infantry tank – large cast armour pieces bolted together. Suspension was by six equally sized wheels on each side, with independent wishbone suspension units for each, rather than bogies. Concern was expressed about the possible fragility of these units in combat, but Valiant was never taken seriously off-road to test them. The drivetrain was to the rear, from a 210 bhp diesel. This low power limited the tank to a predicted top speed of 12 mph, although this was still acceptable to both the infantry tank and \"assault tank\" concepts.\n\nFollowing from the later Valentine VIII and XI models, the turret was to accept either the QF 6 pounder or the QF 75 mm, with space for a turret crew of three (commander, gunner, loader). This was achieved at the cost of a large heavy turret with near-vertical faces and a massive cast front face with distinctively prominent bolts. The mantlet was internal and a weak point against accurate fire at close range. Unlike the late model Valentines it had a co-axial machine-gun.\n\nThe Valiant's suspension was tested by the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment (FVPE) at Chertsey in May 1945. The first day gave minor problems and was abandoned after only of easy on-road driving. However, the driver was already exhausted by this time, finding that the steering levers needed his full weight to operate and that the seat, footbrake and gear lever all carried risk of physical injury in using them. The Officer in Charge decided to abandon the trials there and then as it was impossible and unsafe to continue, reporting that \"in his view the entire project should be closed\". There were also issues with weight distribution and the ground clearance of only 9 inches, and by that point of the war there was no longer a need for the tank. The Valiant project was terminated.\n\nA Valiant II was mentioned in late 1943, but little more was heard of it. In February 1944 there was more detailed discussion of a \"Heavy Valiant\", which may have been the same and has been reported as such in some sources.\n\nThe Heavy Valiant was a substantially different vehicle, only using the turret and driver's compartment of the Valiant on a hull derived from the A33 Excelsior and its T1 suspension. This gave armour of 9 (hull front) and 10 inches (turret) thickness. Weight was now estimated at 42 tons, which is comparable with the original Excelsior despite almost doubling the armour thickness, and so this must have been a much smaller tank. Power was doubled to cope with the weight, using the new and compact 400 bhp Rolls Royce Meteorite engine (a cut-down V8 Meteor) and an improved transmission. The mistake of the Valentine was to be repeated, where the turret was up-gunned to the 95mm howitzer of the Centaur IV at the cost of forcing the commander to take over the loader's task in a two-man turret. There is a record of a prototype having gone to the ranges at Lulworth Cove for trials in January 1945, but no other record of what it looked like.\n\nThe sole Valiant was retained by the School of Tank Technology, where students were treated to an inspection of it at the end of their course and invited to find fault. David Fletcher wrote of this: \"One hopes they started early in the morning.\"\n\nThe Valiant can now be seen at The Tank Museum.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954058", "title": "Economic history of India", "text": "Economic history of India\n\nThe economic history of India begins with the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1300 BCE), whose economy appears to have depended significantly on trade and examples of overseas trade. The Vedic period saw countable units of precious metal being used for exchange. The term \"Nishka\" appears in this sense in the Rigveda. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the next three millennia, starting around the 1st millennia BCE and ending around the beginning of British Raj.\n\nAround 600 BCE, the Mahajanapadas minted punch-marked silver coins. The period was marked by intensive trade activity and urban development. By 300 BCE, the Maurya Empire had united most of the Indian subcontinent. The resulting political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity.\n\nThe Maurya Empire was followed by classical and early medieval kingdoms, including the Cholas, Guptas, Western Gangas, Harsha, Palas, Rashtrakutas and Hoysalas. During this period, Between 1 CE and 1000 CE, the Indian subcontinent is estimated to have accounted for one-third, to one-fourth of the world's population, and product, though GDP per capita was stagnant. According to the Balance of Economic Power, India had the largest economy for most of the interval between the 1st century and 18th century, the most of any region for a large part of the last two millennia. Up until 1000 CE, India had a large share of the world population, but its GDP per capita was not much higher than subsistence level.\n\nIndia experienced per-capita GDP growth in the high medieval era after 1000 CE, during the Delhi Sultanate in the north and Vijayanagara Empire in the south, but was not as productive as Ming China until the 16th century. By the late 17th century, most of the Indian subcontinent had been reunited under the Mughal Empire, which became the largest economy and manufacturing power in the world, producing about a quarter of global GDP, before fragmenting and being conquered over the next century. During the medieval times, India was the world leader in manufacturing, producing 25% of the world's industrial output up until the mid-18th century, prior to British rule. Bengal Subah, the empire's wealthiest province, that solely accounted for 40% of Dutch imports outside the west, was a world leader in the productive agriculture, textile manufacturing and shipbuilding, and as its result, the proto-industrialization was emerged. \n\nBy 18th century, Mysoreans embarked on an ambitious economic development program that established the Kingdom of Mysore as a major economic power, with some of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century. During this period, Mysore overtook the wealthy Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with highly productive agriculture and textile manufacturing. Mysore's average income was five times higher than subsistence level at the time. The Maratha Empire also managed an effective administration and tax collection policy throughout the core areas under their control and extracted chauth from vassal states.\n\nIndia experienced deindustrialisation and cessation of various craft industries under British rule, which along with fast economic and population growth in the Western World resulted in India's share of the world economy declining from 24.4% in 1700 to 4.2% in 1950, and its share of global industrial output declining from 25% in 1750 to 2% in 1900. Due to its ancient history as a trading zone and later its colonial status, colonial India remained economically integrated with the world, with high levels of trade, investment and migration.\n\nThe Republic of India, founded in 1947, adopted central planning for most of its independent history, with extensive public ownership, regulation, red tape and trade barriers. After the 1991 economic crisis, the central government launched economic liberalisation, allowing it to emerge as one of the world's fastest growing large economies.\n\nIndus Valley Civilisation, the first known permanent and predominantly urban settlement, flourished between 3500 BCE and 1800 BCE. It featured an advanced and thriving economic system. Its citizens practised agriculture, domesticated animals, made sharp tools and weapons from copper, bronze and tin and traded with other cities. Evidence of well-laid streets, layouts, drainage system and water supply in the valley's major cities, Dholavira, Harappa, Lothal, Mohenjo-daro and Rakhigarhi reveals their knowledge of urban planning.\n\nAlthough ancient India had a significant urban population, much of India's population resided in villages, whose economy was largely isolated and self-sustaining. Agriculture was the predominant occupation and satisfied a village's food requirements while providing raw materials for hand-based industries such as textile, food processing and crafts. Besides farmers, people worked as barbers, carpenters, doctors (Ayurvedic practitioners), goldsmiths and weavers.\n\nReligion played an influential role in shaping economic activities.\n\nPilgrimage towns like Prayagraj, Benares, Nasik and Puri, mostly centred around rivers, developed into centres of trade and commerce. Religious functions, festivals and the practice of taking a pilgrimage resulted in an early version of the hospitality industry.\n\nEconomics in Jainism is influenced by Mahavira and his philosophy. He was the last of the 24 Tirthankars, who spread Jainism. Relating to economics he explained the importance of the concept of 'anekanta' (non-absolutism).\n\nIn the joint family system, members of a family pooled their resources to maintain the family and invest in business ventures. The system ensured younger members were trained and employed and that older and disabled persons would be supported by their families. The system prevented agricultural land from splitting with each generation, aiding yield from the benefits of scale. Such sanctions curbed the spirit of rivality in junior members and instilled a sense of obedience.\n\nAlong with the family- and individually-owned businesses, ancient India possessed other forms of engaging in collective activity, including the gana, pani, puga, vrata, sangha, nigama and Shreni. Nigama, pani and Shreni refer most often to economic organisations of merchants, craftspeople and artisans, and perhaps even para-military entities. In particular, the Shreni shared many similarities with modern corporations, which were used in India from around the 8th century BCE until around the 10th century CE. The use of such entities in ancient India was widespread, including in virtually every kind of business, political and municipal activity.\n\nThe Shreni was a separate legal entity that had the ability to hold property separately from its owners, construct its own rules for governing the behaviour of its members and for it to contract, sue and be sued in its own name. Ancient sources such as \"Laws of Manu\" VIII and Chanakya's \"Arthashastra\" provided rules for lawsuits between two or more Shreni and some sources make reference to a government official (\"Bhandagarika\") who worked as an arbitrator for disputes amongst Shreni from at least the 6th century BCE onwards. Between 18 and 150 Shreni at various times in ancient India covered both trading and craft activities. This level of specialisation is indicative of a developed economy in which the Shreni played a critical role. Some Shreni had over 1,000 members.\n\nThe Shreni had a considerable degree of centralised management. The headman of the Shreni represented the interests of the Shreni in the king's court and in many business matters. The headman could bind the Shreni in contracts, set work conditions, often received higher compensation and was the administrative authority. The headman was often selected via an election by the members of the Shreni, and could also be removed from power by the general assembly. The headman often ran the enterprise with two to five executive officers, also elected by the assembly.\n\nPunch marked silver ingots were in circulation around the 5th century BCE. They were the first metallic coins minted around the 6th century BCE by the Mahajanapadas of the Gangetic plains and were India's earliest traces of coinage. While India's many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, barter was still widely prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their crops as revenue while its craftsmen received a stipend out of the crops for their services. Each village was mostly self-sufficient.\n\nDuring the Maurya Empire (c. 321–185 BCE), important changes and developments affected the Indian economy. It was the first time most of India was unified under one ruler. With an empire in place, trade routes became more secure. The empire spent considerable resources building and maintaining roads. The improved infrastructure, combined with increased security, greater uniformity in measurements, and increasing usage of coins as currency, enhanced trade.\n\nMaritime trade was carried out extensively between South India and Southeast and West Asia from early times until around the fourteenth century AD. Both the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts were the sites of important trading centres from as early as the first century BC, used for import and export as well as transit points between the Mediterranean region and southeast Asia. Over time, traders organised themselves into associations which received state patronage. Historians Tapan Raychaudhuri and Irfan Habib claim this state patronage for overseas trade came to an end by the thirteenth century AD, when it was largely taken over by the local Parsi, Jewish, Syrian Christian and Muslim communities, initially on the Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.\n\nOther scholars suggest trading from India to West Asia and Eastern Europe was active between the 14th and 18th centuries. During this period, Indian traders settled in Surakhani, a suburb of greater Baku, Azerbaijan. These traders built a Hindu temple, which suggests commerce was active and prosperous for Indians by the 17th century.\n\nFurther north, the Saurashtra and Bengal coasts played an important role in maritime trade, and the Gangetic plains and the Indus valley housed several centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was carried out via the Khyber Pass connecting the Punjab region with Afghanistan and onward to the Middle East and Central Asia. Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, barter was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while their craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.\n\nBefore and during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE), Islam underlay a cosmopolitan civilization. It offered wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks. They spanned large parts of Afro-Eurasia, leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system.\n\nThe period coincided with a greater use of mechanical technology in the Indian subcontinent. From the 13th century onwards, India began widely adopting mechanical technologies from the Islamic world, including water-raising wheels with gears and pulleys, machines with cams and cranks, papermaking technology, and the spinning wheel. The worm gear roller cotton gin was invented in the Indian subcontinent during the 13th–14th centuries, and is still used in India through to the present day. The incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin first appeared in the Indian subcontinent some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire. The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India during the Delhi Sultanate era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production.\n\nIndia's GDP per capita was lower than the Middle East from 1 CE (16% lower) to 1000 CE (about 40% lower), but by the late Delhi Sultanate era in 1500, India's GDP per capita approached that of the Middle East.\n\nAccording to economic historian Angus Maddison in \"Contours of the world economy, 1–2030 CE: essays in macro-economic history\", the Indian subcontinent was the world's most productive region, from 1 CE to 1600.\n\nEconomy of India under Mughal Empire, Maratha Empire and among others was prosperous into the early 18th century. Parthasarathi estimated that 28,000 tonnes of bullion (mainly from the New World) flowed into the Indian subcontinent between 1600 and 1800, equating to 20% of the world's production in the period.\n\nAn estimate of the annual income of Emperor Akbar the Great's treasury, in 1600, is £17.5 million (in contrast to the tax take of Great Britain two hundred years later, in 1800, totaled £16 million). The South Asia region, in 1600, was estimated to be the second largest in the world, behind China's.\n\nHistorian Shireen Moosvi estimates that Mughal India had a per-capita income 1.24% higher in the late 16th century than British India had in the early 20th century, although the difference would be less if increasing purchasing power in terms of manufactured goods were taken into account. She also estimates that the secondary sector contributed a higher percentage to the Mughal economy (18.2%) than it did to the economy of early 20th-century British India (11.2%).\n\nBy the late 17th century, the Mughal Empire was at its peak and had expanded to include almost 90 percent of the Indian subcontinent. It enforced a uniform customs and tax-administration system. In 1700, the exchequer of the Emperor Aurangzeb reported an annual revenue of more than £100 million, or $450 million, more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France, while controlling just 7 times the population.\n\nBy 1700, Mughal India had become the world's largest economy, ahead of Qing China and Western Europe, containing approximately 24.2% of the World's population, and producing about a quarter of world output. Mughal India produced about 25% of global industrial output into the early 18th century. India's GDP growth increased under the Mughal Empire, exceeding growth in the prior 1,500 years. The Mughals were responsible for building an extensive road system, creating a uniform currency, and the unification of the country. The Mughals adopted and standardized the rupee currency introduced by Sur Emperor Sher Shah Suri. The Mughals minted tens of millions of coins, with purity of at least 96%, without debasement until the 1720s. The empire met global demand for Indian agricultural and industrial products.\n\nCities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization (15% of its population lived in urban centres), more urban than Europe at the time and British India in the 19th century. Multiple cities had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people, while some including Agra (in Agra Subah) hosted up to 800,000 people and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million. 64% of the workforce were in the primary sector (including agriculture), while 36% were in the secondary and tertiary sectors. The workforce had a higher percentage in non-primary sectors than Europe at the time; in 1700, 65–90% of Europe's workforce were in agriculture, and in 1750, 65–75% were in agriculture.\n\nIndian agricultural production increased. Food crops included wheat, rice, and barley, while non-food cash crops included cotton, indigo and opium. By the mid-17th century, Indian cultivators had begun to extensively grow two crops from the Americas, maize and tobacco. Bengali peasants learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal Subah as a major silk-producing region. Agriculture was advanced compared to Europe, exemplified by the earlier common use of the seed drill.\nThe Mughal administration emphasized agrarian reform, which began under the non-Mughal Emperor Sher Shah Suri. Akbar adopted this and added more reforms. The Mughal government funded the building of irrigation systems, which produced much higher crop yields and harvests.\n\nOne reform introduced by Akbar was a new land revenue system called \"zabt\". He replaced the tribute system with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency. The revenue system was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton, indigo, sugar cane, tree-crops, and opium, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, adding to rising market demand. Under the \"zabt\" system, the Mughals conducted extensive cadastral surveying to assess the cultivated area. The Mughal state encouraged greater land cultivation by offering tax-free periods to those who brought new land under cultivation.\n\nAccording to evidence cited by economic historians Immanuel Wallerstein, Irfan Habib, Percival Spear, and Ashok Desai, per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century Mughal India was higher than in 17th-century Europe and early 20th-century British India.\n\nUntil the 18th century, Mughal India was the most important manufacturing center for international trade. Key industries included textiles, shipbuilding and steel. Processed products included cotton textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute products, metalware, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter. This growth of manufacturing has been referred to as a form of proto-industrialization, similar to 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.\n\nEarly modern Europe imported products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, spices, peppers, indigo, silks and saltpeter (for use in munitions). European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. In contrast, demand for European goods in Mughal India was light. Exports were limited to some woolens, ingots, glassware, mechanical clocks, weapons, particularly blades for Firangi swords, and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India to pay for South Asian imports. Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.\n\nThe largest manufacturing industry was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos and muslins, available unbleached in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade. The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around Dhaka. Bengal alone accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch. Bengali silk and cotton textiles were exported in large quantities to Europe, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nMughal India had a large shipbuilding industry, particularly in the Bengal Subah province. Economic historian Indrajit Ray estimates shipbuilding output of Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at 223,250 tons annually, compared with 23,061 tons produced in nineteen colonies in North America from 1769 to 1771.\n\nBengal Subah was the Mughal's wealthiest province, generating 50% of the empire's GDP and 12% of the world's GDP. According to Ray, it was globally prominent in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding. Bengal's capital city Dhaka was the empire's financial capital, with a population exceeding one million. It was an exporter of silk and cotton textiles, steel, saltpeter and agricultural and industrial products.\n\nDomestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles.\n\nIn the early half of the 18th century, Mughal Empire fell into decline, with Delhi sacked in Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire, the treasury emptied, tens of thousands killed, and many thousands more carried off, with their livestock, as slaves, weakening the empire and leading to the emergence of post-Mughal states. The Mughals were replaced by the Marathas as the dominant military power in much of India, while the other smaller regional kingdoms who were mostly late Mughal tributaries, such as the Nawabs in the north and the Nizams in the south, declared autonomy. However, the efficient Mughal tax administration system was left largely intact, with Tapan Raychaudhuri estimating revenue assessment actually increased to 50 percent or more, in contrast to China's 5 to 6 percent, to cover the cost of the wars. Similarly in the same period, Maddison gives the following estimates for the late Mughal economy's income distribution:\nAmong the post-Mughal states that emerged in the 18th century, the dominant economic powers were Bengal Subah (under the Nawabs of Bengal) and the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore (under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan). The former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal, which experienced six invasions, over a decade, claimed to have killed hundreds of thousands, blocked trade with the Persian and Ottoman empires, and weakened the territory's economy to the point the Nawab of Bengal agreed to a peace treaty with the Marathas. The agreement made Bengal Subah a tributary to the Marathas, agreeing to pay Rs. 1.2 million in tribute annually, as the Chauth of Bengal and Bihar. The Nawab of Bengal also paid Rs. 3.2 million to the Marathas, towards the arrears of chauth for the preceding years. The chauth was paid annually by the Nawab of Bengal, up to his defeat at the Battle of Plassey by the East India Company in 1757.\n\nSivramkrishna states that the economy of the Kingdom of Mysore then overtook that of Bengal, with real income five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, Maddison estimates the 1820 GDP per-capita (PPP 1990 $) of the Netherlands at $1,838, and $1,706 for Britain.\n\nJeffrey G. Williamson argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire, and that British rule later caused further deindustrialization. According to Williamson, the Mughal Empire's decline reduced agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then nominal wages, and then textile prices, which cost India textile market share to Britain even before the latter developed factory technology, though Indian textiles maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles until the 19th century. Prasannan Parthasarathi countered that several post-Mughal states did not decline, notably Bengal and Mysore, which were comparable to Britain into the late 18th century.\n\nThe British East India Company conquered Bengal Subah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. After gaining the right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the East India Company largely ceased importing gold and silver, which it had hitherto used to pay for goods shipped back to Britain. \n\nIn addition, as under Mughal rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. Consequently, in the period 1760–1800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished. The closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates and the standardization of coinage added to the economic downturn.\n\nDuring the period 1780–1860 India changed from an exporter of processed goods paid for in bullion to an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. In the 1750s fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa, while by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. From the late 18th century the British cotton mill industry began to lobby their government to tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in—and then inundate—Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from £5.2 million in 1850 to £18.4 million in 1896. The abolition of slavery encouraged Caribbean plantations to organize the import of South Asian labor.\n\nIndia accounted for 25% of the world's industrial output in 1750, declining to 2% of the world's industrial output in 1900. Britain replaced India as the world's largest textile manufacturer in the 19th century. In terms of urbanization, Mughal India had a higher percentage of its population (15%) living in urban centers in 1600 than British India did in the 19th century.\n\nSeveral economic historians claimed that in the 18th century real wages were falling in India, and were \"far below European levels\". This has been disputed by others, who argued that real wage decline occurred in the early 19th century, or possibly beginning in the late 18th century, largely as a result of \"\"globalization forces\"\".\n\nClingingsmith and Williamson argue India deindustrialized, in the period between 1750 and 1860, due to two very different causes, before reindustrialization. Between 1750 and 1810, they suggest the loss of Mughal hegemony allowed new despotic rulers to revenue farm their conquered populations, seeing tax and rent demands increase to 50% of production, compared to the 5–6% extracted in China during the period, and levied largely to fund regional warfare. Combined with the use of labour and livestock for martial purposes, grain and textile prices were driven up, along with nominal wages, as the populus attempted to meet the demands, reducing the competitiveness of Indian handicrafts, and impacting the regional textile trade. Then from 1810 to 1860, the expansion of the British factory system drove down the relative price of textiles worldwide, through productivity advances, a trend that was magnified in India as the concurrent transport revolution dramatically reduced transportation costs, and in a sub-continent that had not seen metalled roads, the introduction of mechanical transport exposed once protected markets to global competition, hitting artisanal manufacture, but stabilizing the agricultural sector.\n\nAngus Maddison states:\n\nAmiya Bagchi estimates:\n\nDuring this period, the East India Company began tax administration reforms in a fast expanding empire spread over , or 35 percent of Indian domain. Indirect rule was established on protectorates and buffer states.\n\nRay (2009) raises three basic questions about the 19th-century cotton textile industry in Bengal: when did the industry begin to decay, what was the extent of its decay during the early 19th century, and what were the factors that led to this? Since no data exist on production, Ray uses the industry's market performance and its consumption of raw materials. Ray challenges the prevailing belief that the industry's permanent decline started in the late 18th century or the early 19th century. The decline actually started in the mid-1820s. The pace of its decline was, however, slow though steady at the beginning, but reached a crisis by 1860, when 563,000 workers lost their jobs. Ray estimates that the industry shrank by about 28% by 1850. However, it survived in the high-end and low-end domestic markets. Ray agrees that British discriminatory policies undoubtedly depressed the industry's exports, but suggests its decay is better explained by technological innovations in Britain.\n\nOther historians point to colonization as a major factor in both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution. The capital amassed from Bengal following its 1757 conquest supported investment in British industries such as textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution as well as increasing British wealth, while contributing to deindustrialization in Bengal. Colonization forced the large Indian market to open to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to heavily taxed local Indian producers. In Britain protectionist policies such as high tariffs restricted Indian textile sales. By contrast, raw cotton was imported without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles and sold them back to India. British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.\n\nIndian textiles had maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century, when Britain eventually overtook India as the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer. In 1811, Bengal was still a major exporter of cotton cloth to the Americas and the Indian Ocean. However, Bengali exports declined over the course of the early 19th century, as British imports to Bengal increased, from 25% in 1811 to 93% in 1840. By 1820, India had fallen from the top rank to become the second-largest economy in the world, behind China.\n\nHistorians have questioned why India failed to industrialise in the 19th century. As the global cotton industry underwent a technological revolution in the 18th century, while Indian industry stagnated after adopting the Flying shuttle, and industrialisation began only in the late 19th century. Several historians have suggested that this was because India was still a largely agricultural nation with low Commodity money wage levels, arguing that nominal wages were high in Britain so cotton producers had the incentive to invent and purchase expensive new labour-saving technologies, and that wages levels were low in India so producers preferred to increase output by hiring more workers rather than investing in technology.\n\nEconomic historians such as Prasannan Parthasarathi have criticized this argument, pointing to earnings data that show Real wages in 18th-century Bengal and Mysore were higher than in Britain. Instead, Parthasarathi argues that Indian textile prices were lower because of India's lower food prices, which was the result of higher agricultural productivity. Compared to Britain, the silver coin prices of grain were about one-half in Mysore and one-third in Bengal, resulting in lower silver coin prices for Indian textiles, giving them a price advantage in global markets. According to evidence cited by Immanuel Wallerstein, Irfan Habib, Percival Spear and Ashok Desai, per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century Mughal India was higher than in 17th-century Europe and early 20th-century British India.\n\nStephen Broadberry and Bishnupriya Gupta gave the following comparative estimates for Indian and UK populations and GDP per capita during 1600–1871 in terms of 1990 international dollars.\nHowever, Parthasarathi criticised the per-capita GDP estimates from Broadberry and Gupta. Workers in the textile industry, for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore. Others such as Andre Gunder Frank, Robert A. Denemark, Kenneth Pomeranz and Amiya Kumar Bagchi also criticised estimates that showed low per-capita income and GDP growth rates in Asia (especially China and India) prior to the 19th century, pointing to later research that found significantly higher per-capita income and growth rates in China and India during that period.\n\nEconomic historian Sashi Sivramkrishna estimates Mysore's average per-capita income in the late 18th century to be five times higher than subsistence, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain. According to economic historian Paul Bairoch, India as well as China had a higher GDP per capita than Europe in 1750. For 1750, Bairoch estimated the GNP per capita for the Western world to be $182 in 1960 US dollars ($ in 1990 dollars) and for the non-Western world to be $188 in 1960 dollars ($ in 1990 dollars), exceeded by both China and India. Other estimates he gives include $150–190 for England in 1700 and $160–210 for India in 1800. Bairoch estimated that it was only after 1800 that Western European per-capita income pulled ahead.\n\nIn 1787, a Gunpowder Factory was established at Ishapore; it began production in 1791, it is now the Rifle Factory Ishapore, beginning in 1904. In 1801, Gun & Shell Factory, Calcutta was established and the production began on 18 March 1802. There were eighteen ordnance factories before India became independent in 1947.\n\nThe formal dissolution of the Mughal Dynasty heralded a change in British treatment of Indian subjects. During the British Raj, massive railway projects were begun in earnest and government jobs and guaranteed pensions attracted a large number of upper caste Hindus into the civil service for the first time. British cotton exports absorbed 55 percent of the Indian market by 1875. In the 1850s the first cotton mills opened in Bombay, posing a challenge to the cottage-based home production system based on family labour.\n\nAfter its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000, and then moved to join Britain on a gold monetary standard. France, the US, and other industrialising countries followed Germany in adopting gold in the 1870s. Countries such as Japan that did not have the necessary access to gold or those, such as India, that were subject to imperial policies remained mostly on a silver standard. Silver-based and gold-based economies then diverged dramatically. The worst affected were silver economies that traded mainly with gold economies. Silver reserves increased in size, causing gold to rise in relative value. The impact on silver-based India was profound, given that most of its trade was with Britain and other gold-based countries. As the price of silver fell, so too did the exchange value of the rupee, when measured against sterling.\n\nThe Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1890 to 1910, matching population growth. The result was no change in income levels. Agriculture was still dominant, with most peasants at the subsistence level.\n\nEntrepreneur Jamsetji Tata (1839–1904) began his industrial career in 1877 with the Central India Spinning, Weaving, and Manufacturing Company in Bombay. While other Indian mills produced cheap coarse yarn (and later cloth) using local short-staple cotton and simple machinery imported from Britain, Tata did much better by importing expensive longer-stapled cotton from Egypt and buying more complex ring-spindle machinery from the United States to spin finer yarn that could compete with imports from Britain.\n\nIn the 1890s, Tata launched plans to expand into the heavy industry using Indian funding. The Raj did not provide capital, but aware of Britain's declining position against the U.S. and Germany in the steel industry, it wanted steel mills in India so it promised to purchase any surplus steel Tata could not otherwise sell.\n\nBritish investors built a modern railway system in the late 19th century—it became the then fourth-largest in the world and was renowned for the quality of construction and service. The government was supportive, realising its value for military use and for economic growth. The railways at first were privately owned and operated, and run by British administrators, engineers and skilled craftsmen. At first, only the unskilled workers were Indians.\n\nA plan for a rail system was first advanced in 1832. The first train ran from Red Hills to Chintadripet bridge in Madras, inaugurated in 1837. It was called \"Red Hill Railway\". It was used for freight transport. A few more short lines were built in the 1830s and 1840s. They did not interconnect and were used for freight forwarding. The East India Company (and later the colonial government) encouraged new railway companies backed by private investors under a scheme that would provide land and guarantee an annual return of up to five percent during the initial years of operation. The companies were to build and operate the lines under a 99-year lease, with the government retaining the option to buy them earlier. In 1854 Governor-General Lord Dalhousie formulated a plan to construct a network of trunk lines connecting the principal regions. A series of new rail companies were established, leading to rapid expansion.\n\nIn 1853, the first passenger train service was inaugurated between Bori Bunder in Bombay and Thane, covering a distance of . The route mileage of this network increased from in 1860 to in 1880 – mostly radiating inland from the port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Most of the railway construction was done by Indian companies supervised by British engineers. The system was sturdily built. Several large princely states built their own rail systems and the network spread across India. By 1900 India had a full range of rail services with diverse ownership and management, operating on broad, metre and narrow gauge networks.\n\nHeadrick argues that both the Raj lines and the private companies hired only European supervisors, civil engineers and even operating personnel, such as locomotive engineers. The government's Stores Policy required that bids on railway contracts be submitted to the India Office in London, shutting out most Indian firms. The railway companies purchased most of their hardware and parts in Britain. Railway maintenance workshops existed in India, but were rarely allowed to manufacture or repair locomotives. TISCO first won orders for rails only in the 1920s. Christensen (1996) looked at colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service and private-versus-public interests. He concluded that making the railways dependent on the state hindered success, because railway expenses had to go through the same bureaucratic budgeting process as did all other state expenses. Railway costs could therefore not respond to needs of the railways or their passengers.\n\nIn 1951, forty-two separate railway systems, including thirty-two lines owned by the former Indian princely states, were amalgamated to form a single unit named the \"Indian Railways\". The existing rail systems were abandoned in favor of zones in 1951 and a total of six zones came into being in 1952.\n\nDebate continues about the economic impact of British imperialism on India. The issue was first raised by Edmund Burke who in the 1780s vehemently attacked the East India Company, claiming that Warren Hastings and other top officials had ruined the Indian economy and society, and elaborated on in the 19th century by Romesh Chunder Dutt. Indian historian Rajat Kanta Ray (1998) continued this line of reasoning, saying that British rule in the 18th century took the form of plunder and was a catastrophe for the traditional economy. According to the economic drain theory, supported by Ray, the British depleted food, and money stocks and imposed high taxes that helped cause the terrible famine of 1770, which killed a third of the people of Bengal. Ray also argued British India failed to offer the necessary encouragement, technology transfers, and protectionist frameworks, to permit British India to replicate Britain’s own industrialisation, before its independence.\n\nBritish historian P. J. Marshall reinterpreted the view that the prosperity of the Mughal era gave way to poverty and anarchy, arguing that the British takeover was not a sharp break with the past. British control was delegated largely through regional rulers and was sustained by a generally prosperous economy through the 18th century, except for the frequent, deadly famines. Marshall notes the British raised revenue through local tax administrators and kept the old Mughal tax rates. Instead of the Indian nationalist account of the British as alien aggressors, seizing power by brute force and impoverishing the region, Marshall presents a British nationalist interpretation in which the British were not in full control, but instead were controllers in what was primarily an Indian-run society and in which their ability to keep power depended upon cooperation with Indian elites. Marshall admitted that much of his interpretation is rejected by many historians.\n\nBritish colonial rule created an institutional environment that stabilized Indian society, though they stifled trade with the rest of the world. They created a well-developed system of railways, telegraphs and a modern legal system. Extensive irrigation systems were built, providing an impetus for growing cash crops for export and for raw materials for Indian industry, especially jute, cotton, sugarcane, coffee, and tea.\n\nThe Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), headed by Dorabji Tata, opened its plant at Jamshedpur in Bihar in 1908. It became the leading iron and steel producer in India, with 120,000 employees in 1945. TISCO became an India's symbol of technical skill, managerial competence, entrepreneurial flair, and high pay for industrial workers.\n\nDuring the First World War, the railways were used to transport troops and grains to Bombay and Karachi en route to Britain, Mesopotamia and East Africa. With shipments of equipment and parts from Britain curtailed, maintenance became much more difficult; critical workers entered the army; workshops were converted to make artillery; locomotives and cars were shipped to the Middle East. The railways could barely keep up with the sudden increase in demand. By the end of the war, the railways had deteriorated badly. In the Second World War the railways' rolling stock was diverted to the Middle East, and the railway workshops were again converted into munitions workshops.\n\nNon-royal private wealth was encouraged by colonial administrations during these times. Houses of Birla and Sahu Jain began to challenge the Houses of Martin Burn, Bird Heilgers and Andrew Yule. About one-ninth of the national population were urban by 1925.\n\nThe 20-year economic boom cycle ended with the Great Depression of 1929 that had a direct impact on India, with relatively little impact on the modern secondary sector. The colonial administration did little to alleviate debt stress. The worst consequences involved deflation, which increased the burden of the debt on villagers. Total economic output did not decline between 1929 and 1934. The worst-hit sector was jute, based in Bengal, which was an important element in overseas trade; it had prospered in the 1920s but prices dropped in the 1930s. Employment also decline, while agriculture and small-scale industry exhibited gains. The most successful new industry was sugar, which had meteoric growth in the 1930s.\n\nGold-Silver ratio peaked at 100-1 by 1940. The Bank of England records the Indian central bank held a positive balance of £1,160 million on 14 July 1947, and that British India maintained a trade surplus, with the United Kingdom, for the duration of the British Raj eg.\n\nSource: Indian sterling balances, p. 2, 15 Jan.1.1947, Bank of England (BoE), OV56/55.\n\nThe newly independent but weak Union government's treasury reported annual revenue of £334 million in 1950. In contrast, Nizam Asaf Jah VII of Hyderabad State was widely reported to have a fortune of almost £668 million then. About one-sixth of the national population were urban by 1950. A US Dollar was exchanged at 4.79 rupees.\n\nModern economic historians have blamed the colonial rule for the dismal state of India's economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony. Under British rule, India's native manufacturing industries shrank. During the British East India Company's rule in India, production of food crops declined, mass impoverishment and destitution of farmers and numerous famines. The economic policies of the British Raj caused a severe decline in the handicrafts and handloom sectors, with reduced demand and dipping employment; the yarn output of the handloom industry, for example, declined from 419 million pounds in 1850 to 240 million pounds in 1900. The result was a significant transfer of capital from India to England, which led to a massive drain of revenue rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the Indian economy.\n\nThe phrase \"Hindu rate of growth\" is used to refer to the low annual growth rate of the economy of India before 1991. It remained around 3.5% from the 1950s to 1980s, while per capita income growth averaged 1.3% a year. During the same period, South Korea grew by 10% and Taiwan by 12%.\n\nBefore independence a large share of tax revenue was generated by the land tax. Thereafter land taxes steadily declined as a share of revenues.\n\nThe economic problems inherited at independence were exacerbated by the costs associated with the partition, which had resulted in about 2 to 4 million refugees fleeing past each other across the new borders between India and Pakistan. Refugee settlement was a considerable economic strain. Partition divided India into complementary economic zones. Under the British, jute and cotton were grown in the eastern part of Bengal (East Pakistan, after 1971, Bangladesh), but processing took place mostly in the western part of Bengal, which became the Indian state of West Bengal. As a result, after independence India had to convert land previously used for food production to cultivate cotton and jute.\n\nGrowth continued in the 1950s, the rate of growth was less positive than India's politicians expected.\n\nToward the end of Nehru's term as prime minister, India experienced serious food shortages.\n\nBeginning in 1950, India faced trade deficits that increased in the 1960s. The Government of India had a major budget deficit and therefore could not borrow money internationally or privately. As a result, the government issued bonds to the Reserve Bank of India, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated devaluation. India was told it had to liberalise trade before aid would resume. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Defence spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of expenditure, the highest in the period from 1965 to 1989. Exacerbated by the drought of 1965/1966, the devaluation was severe. GDP per capita grew 33% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 142% in the 1970s, before decelerating to 41% in the 1980s and 20% in the 1990s.\n\nFrom FY 1951 to FY 1979, the economy grew at an average rate of about 3.1 percent a year, or at an annual rate of 1.0 percent per capita. During this period, industry grew at an average rate of 4.5 percent a year, compared with 3.0 percent for agriculture.\n\nThe 20-year economic boom cycle ended in 1971 with the Nixon shock. In 1975 India's GDP (in 1990 US dollars) was $545 billion, $1,561 billion in the USSR, $1,266 billion in Japan, and $3,517 billion in the US.\n\nPrime minister Indira Gandhi proclaimed a national emergency and suspended the Constitution in 1975. About one-fifth of the national population were urban by 1975.\n\nPrime Minister Nehru was a believer in socialism and decided that India needed maximum steel production. He, therefore, formed a government-owned company, Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL) and set up three steel plants in the 1950s.\n\nEconomic liberalisation in India in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century led to large economic changes.\nAbout one-fourth of the national population was urban by 2000.\nThe Indian steel industry began expanding into Europe in the 21st century. In January 2007 India's Tata bought European steel maker Corus Group for $11.3 billion. In 2006 Mittal Steel (based in London but with Indian management) acquired Arcelor for $34.3 billion to become the world's biggest steel maker, ArcelorMittal, with 10% of world output.\n\nThe GDP of India in 2007 was estimated at about 8 percent that of the US. The government started the Golden Quadrilateral road network connecting Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata with various Indian regions. The project, completed in January 2012, was the most ambitious infrastructure project of independent India.\n\nThe top 3% of the population still earn 50% of GDP.\n\nThe 20-year economic boom cycle ended in 2012. Productivity stagnated and economic activity remains limited by poor infrastructure such as dilapidated roads, electricity shortages and a cumbersome justice system.\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is converted at 9.46 rupees. Despite continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2009, the Indian economy is mired in bureaucratic hurdles. This was confirmed by a World Bank report published in late 2006 ranking Pakistan (at 74th) well ahead of India (at 134th) based on ease of doing business.\n\n\n\n\nFrankel, Francine R. \"India's Political Economy, 1947–1977: The Gradual Revolution\" (1978).\n\n"}

{"id": "1954084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954084", "title": "Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline", "text": "Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline\n\nAlexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622) was a Scottish lawyer, judge and politician. He served as Lord President of the Court of Session from 1598 to 1604, Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1604 to 1622 and as a Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.\n\nBorn at Seton Palace, East Lothian, Alexander was the son of George Seton, 7th Lord Seton and Isobell Hamilton. The Setons remained a Roman Catholic family after the Scottish Reformation of 1560, and continued to support Mary, Queen of Scots after her abdication and exile in England. Alexander was educated at the German and Roman College in Rome from June 1571 to December 1578. Alexander was noted learning Italian and science (philosophy) in Rome by Baptista da Trento in 1577 in a letter describing plots to marry Elizabeth I of England to the Earl of Leicester and re-instate Mary in Scotland. The family historian Viscount Kingston heard it said that he was skilled in mathematics, heraldry and architecture, and Alexander might have been made a Cardinal if he had stayed at Rome.\n\nIn 1583, Alexander joined his father's embassy to France. William Schaw, the Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland was his companion. They left from Leith in Andrew Lamb's ship. According to the Jesuit Robert Parsons, Lord Seton even considered sending the youthful Alexander back to Scotland as his representative at one point.\n\nAlexander became a Privy Councillor in 1585 and was appointed a Lord of Session as Lord Urquhart in 1586. He rose to be Lord President of the Court of Session and was created Lord Fyvie on 4 March 1598. From July 1593 he led a council convened to manage the estates of Anne of Denmark, and she made him 'bailie and justiciary of the regality of Dunfermline on both sides of Forth on 15 February 1596. In December 1596 Richard Douglas wrote that Seton's mother was a great favourite of Anne of Denmark, and that she \"rules the king her husband\" as an explanation for his promotions.\n\nAt the end of August 1596 according to James Melville, the King arranged a Convention of the Estates at Falkland Palace which included the allies of the forfeited earls. Alexander Seton made a speech like those of Coriolanus or Themistocles calling for the re-instatement of these earls to strengthen the country. The reference to Themistocles, who spoke about naval power to the Athenians, perhaps refers to the forfeited Lord High Admiral of Scotland, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. \n\nOn 7 November 1598 he was made burgess, Guild-brother and Provost of Edinburgh. In March 1598 he took delivery of Spanish and Bordeaux wine, probably for the banquet for Ulrik, the younger brother of Anne of Denmark at Riddle's Court. Other notes in the town's records include a dozen torches supplied by a waxmaker for the baptism of Princess Margaret in April 1599, and another dozen for the baptism of Prince Charles.\n\nHis was regarded as one of the finest legal minds of the time, and he became an advisor to James VI and guardian and tutor to Prince Charles, then called the Duke of Albany. After the Union of the Crowns, Seton remained on the committee supervising Anne's Scottish incomes, while James VI went to England, and the infant Charles remained with Seton at Dunfermline Palace. On 14 March 1604 Seton wrote to Robert Cecil on the subject of the union and opinion in Scotland;This Union is the most at this time of all men's hearts and speeches. I find none of any account here but glad in heart to embrace the same in general: some suspect the particular conditions may engender greater difficulties. I hope the wisdom of the Prince who is both the ground and the cornerstone of this happy Union, with your and other wise men's assistance shall set by all such difficulties: as also I think there can be no particular condition desired for the weal (commonwealth) of one of the nations, but it must be profitable to the other, nor nothing prejudicial to one, but must be hurtful to the other, albeit only by the distracting of their due concord which wise men will think of greater consequence, nor any particular may be subtly cozened (brought) in. This is all I can write even of our thoughts here-away: I doubt not there are divers apprehensions there also.\"\n\nIn 1604 he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland and was created Earl of Dunfermline in 1605. Alexander Seton brought Prince Charles, Duke of Albany, to England in August 1604. He stayed in London till January 1605 in London, co-inciding with the visit of the Ulrik, Duke of Holstein, and had a tour of armouries of the Tower of London. While he was at Whitehall, Viscount Cranborne arranged for him to read the original Treaty of Greenwich, which had led to the war of the Rough Wooing in 1543, and other documents, which he returned to Cecil on 3 November.\n\nAlexander returned to Scotland with more funding to reward his keeping of Prince Charles, made Duke of York on Twelfth Night, and his expenses for his 'pains in the Union' amounting to £200 a year. In February 1616 he was in London and saw Anne of Denmark at Greenwich, writing that he spoke to her in the old familiar manner, although she was ill and kept to her bedchamber. He felt that the Scots were left out of government business as \"we ar leitill bettir nor idill cifres heir\" - \"we are little better than idle ciphers here.\"\n\nLater in 1616, in preparation for the royal visit to Scotland, he was required by the Privy Council of Scotland to declare what remained of the Scottish Royal tapestry collection at Dunfermline Palace. He stated there were 10 pieces \"of auld and worne tapestrie of the storie of Aeneas, the storie of Troy, and of the story of Mankynd.\"\n\nHis modern humanist and neo-stoic attitude was demonstrated by his energetic defence of Geillis Johnstone accused of witchcraft in 1614.\n\nA portrait of his wife Margaret Hay, painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger in 1615 is in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Part of a painted ceiling bearing his monogram and heraldry is displayed at Edinburgh's Huntly House museum: his painted long gallery is still preserved at Pinkie House, now Loretto School. Of Pinkie House the family historian wrote, \"he built ane noble house, brave stone dykes about the garden and orchards, with other commendable policie about it.\" Archaeologists have discovered parts of his garden at Fyvie.\n\nHis will referred to tapestry of \"portrait and forest work\" and gilt leather hangings and curtains, almost as valuable as his library at Fyvie and Pinkie. A catalogue of a part of his library at Pinkie survives.\n\nIn 1599 Robert Pont, the father of the cartographer Timothy Pont dedicated his book, \"A Newe Treatise of the Right Reckoning of Yeares and Ages of the World\", to Alexander Seton. The dedication addressed Seton as \"amongst the rare Maecenases of this Land.\" In 1617, John Napier of Merchiston dedicated his \"Rabdologiae seu Numerationis per virgulas libri duo\" to Seton. The book describes the method of multiplication using the rods called \"Napier's bones,\" and its Latin dedication acknowledges the help of Seton as the \"illustrious Scottish Maecenas.\"\n\nAlexander Seton also commissioned the tomb of his friend the architect William Schaw at Dunfermline Abbey.\n\nAfter 15 days of illness, Alexander died on Sunday 16 June 1622 at Pinkie. On the 19 June his body was taken by boat across the Forth to his house at Dalgety Bay near Dunfermline. He was buried in his vault in Dalgety Church, on 9 July 1622. A manuscript describes in detail the elaborate procession from the house (long demolished) to the kirk, which included his Master Stabler riding in full armour, and his Master Household with a black flag painted with a skull and tears. John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St Andrews gave the sermon.\n\nAlexander Seton first married Lilias Drummond, daughter of Patrick Drummond, 3rd Lord Drummond, their children were;\n\nAlexander Seton married secondly in 1601, Grizel Leslie, a daughter of James Leslie, Master of Rothes, their children were;\n\nAlexander Seton married thirdly, circa 1607, Margaret Hay, daughter of James Hay, 7th Lord Hay of Yester.\nSeton's widow Margaret Hay married James Livingstone, Lord Almond and Earl of Callendar, in 1633.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954092", "title": "X3: Reunion", "text": "X3: Reunion\n\nX3: Reunion is a single-player space trading and combat video game developed by Egosoft and published by Deep Silver. It is the third installment in the \"X\" series and the sequel to \"\" (2003), which in turn followed \"\" (1999). \"X3: Reunion\" was released originally for Windows in 2005. The game was later ported to Mac OS X and Linux.\n\nThe original retail version of \"X3\" reception improved after update patches by Egosoft according to players and critics, one remained skeptical.\n\nEgosoft have continued to expand and develop this game since release, adding new ships and equipment, a new kind of station as well as new modding tools, and a new series of missions. New material for this game - official and fan made - is frequently released through Egosoft's official website.\n\n\"X3: Reunion\" incorporates open-ended \"sandbox\" gameplay. The main quest can be postponed or ignored as the player explores the expansive universe and spends the most time in control of a ship, doing tasks of their own choosing. Different ships are available for various tasks: small, fast scouting ships; freighters; powerful battleships; and massive carriers for moving a fleet. Most ships seen in the game can be bought or captured, and flown by the player. The player is free to go anywhere in the X-Universe at any time and explore, complete plot-related goals or to fulfil their own personal goals.\n\n\"X3\" uses a new, specifically developed graphics engine to give highly detailed renders of ships and stations, along with photo-realistic planets and a host of new effects, including lighting, shadow and reflection. Graphically, Egosoft redesigned everything from scratch. The stations are restructured, larger and more detailed. Few contain the internal docking ports of the prior games, instead featuring external docking clamps. Ship sizes have been redesigned according to a logical scale. Egosoft ensured a pilot would actually fit in their cockpit, and that a carrier vessel was actually large enough to carry a given number of ships. As such, ships and stations are noticeably different in size from prior games.\n\nThe HUD has also been altered. Egosoft removed non-functional internal cockpit graphics, giving the player a largely unobstructed view of space. There are now markers over game objects such as ships, stations and large asteroids, and each object is selectable by a simple mouse click, or through a keyboard or controller. \"X3\" uses a new interface designed to be faster, more user friendly, and compatible with a console controller. The game carries over many of the same short-cut keys from previous games, but now the mouse too can be used for functions including menu navigation, target selection, flying and combat.\n\nThe economy has been redesigned to be more sophisticated, with non-player ships now in direct competition with the player. New tools have been added to help the player compete in the X-Universe, including a new way of linking factories together into complexes which can be self-sustaining to varying degrees. There are also new in-game software products that allow a player to automate operations. In addition, Egosoft presents the player with a number of new scripting tools encouraging computer literate players to write their own functions into the game. This is further supported through Egosoft's scripts and Modding forum, where players share ideas.\nCombat AI is improved, and enemy behavior redesigned. Many pirates now travel in gangs, often heavily armed, making them much more threatening than in earlier games. There are also smugglers, pirates who remain hidden until their cargo is scanned for contraband wares. There are now pirate missions available to the player, as well as a new pirate faction, known as the Yaki. Xenon and Kha'ak remain the primary antagonists; both races are entirely hostile and will often mount full scale sector invasions.\n\nStatus has far more relevance than in previous games. Now, many kinds of weapon, ship, and factory are not purchasable until the player has earned sufficient reputation with the vendor race. With some races, reputation can be earned through trade; with others, the player must earn respect by killing unwanted visitors in the race's space - such as pirates, Khaak, or Xenon. Some races appreciate both. By choosing to be an upstanding citizen, the player can earn the right to buy powerful new weapons, ships and technologies. By engaging in piracy, destruction, smuggling or other crime the player may lose reputation, and so may lose the privilege to buy things. The persistent wrongdoer may lose the right to land at stations, or even to enter sectors, being attacked on sight. Eventually, the player may find it impossible to buy many of the game's most powerful ships, weapons and technologies (although such things may still be possible to acquire through less orthodox means).\n\nBy \"X3\", the X-Universe consists of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations and up to four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player to go where they like, when they like, doing whatever they like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force of the game is to acquire credits (the universal currency) and status.\n\nThe game contains numerous races. Status affects how individuals in different races respond to the player and what kind of missions are offered. A player's status is categorised according to \"Mercantile\" skill, \"Combat\" skill and a \"Notoriety\" ranking for each race.\n\nUsing credits, a player can buy wares from stations. These wares may be used, or flown to another station where they can be sold, ideally for a profit. However, prices vary depending on demand; the less of a ware there is, the higher its price. As such, the X-Universe has a truly dynamic market-driven economy. A player can capitalise on emergent trends, meeting demand to make vast profits, or as easily, can waste money and time on a bad cargo choice. In \"X3\", many NPC ships have the same plan, and the player can easily miss their intended market if another ship arrives first.\nAs players builds profit they can buy equipment, weapons, ships, and even their own factories.\n\nFactory stations consume power and resources to produce products, which can then be sold into the X economy. If the product is rare, and the resources are cheap and plentiful, the factory can make profit. If not, it is possible to lose money. By filling a gap in the economy, a player can make solid and consistent profit through a factory. However, \"X3\"s economy is self-adjusting; NPCs are also able to build factories and can similarly profit. As such, \"X3\" has the most advanced, realistic, and arguably the most competitive economy of all the X games.\n\nThe player can acquire an unlimited number of ships and stations, of varying size, shape and function. Starting with little, the players can build their empire, set their own goals, and choose their own path in how they wish to shape the universe.\n\nThere are many different wares in \"X3\". Some are produced, others are constantly available such as software upgrades. Example classes of ware include lasers, missiles, shields, energy, minerals, foodstuffs, technological and biological.\n\nFactories are stations which use resources to create one or many products. The needed resources and produced wares need to be transported by a ship. Traders in the universe must move wares between the factories to keep production going; if supply exceeds demand a factory will often stop producing goods. The player can build factories by buying them at a shipyard and loading them on board a large transport ship (TL class). The player factories can own their own ships to buy resources and sell products. There are many factory options to configure the trader ships behaviour and job. Player factories can also connect to each other to share resources and products. The factories are connected through tubes and the docking bay is moved to a central complex hub.\n\nTrading Stations are usually found in every established sector. They each have a list of wares which they buy and sell at a fixed price. Equipment docks are trading stations which are aimed at the distribution of ship upgrades and equipment. They trade in missiles, lasers, shields, software and upgrades. All types of ships can dock at an equipment dock. Wares in both stations gradually deplete over time, ensuring a steady demand for higher-tier goods.\n\nShipyards sell ships and stations to the player. The player can sell and repair their ships at shipyards.\n\nPirate bases are located around the \"X-universe\". The player can buy and sell illegal goods in these stations. The player can also hire a hacker to change stations from hostile to friendly, allowing the player's ships to dock at stations they would not normally be able to trade with.\n\nThere are a handful of special stations which do not produce any goods. These are used in the plot.\n\nTrading ships move wares from one station to another. The NPC traders can specialise in one or more classes of ware and provide factories with their resources. Unlike previous games in the X-Series, NPC traders are not owned by a single factory or station, but are instead all freelance traders, looking for the best trade runs between stations.\n\nA range of different ship classes are available to fill different game functions. With some exceptions, each race produces their own kind of ship for each class.\n\nThe game is set in Earth year 2935 (X Universe year X 765), in a universe (seemingly) far removed from our own. The player reprises the role of Julian Gardna, also known as Julian Brennan, from the .\n\nAfter his arrival at Argon Prime, Julian is contacted by his old friend Ban Danna of the Argon Secret Service. Danna informs him that the Argon military has suffered heavy losses in their war with the Kha'ak, and asks Julian to help in training some new pilots. Julian agrees and soon a series of events unfold, leading Julian to hunt down the seeds, ancient alien artifacts that may hold the key to making jump-gates, and allow a reunion with the lost planet Earth.\n\nFor X3s plot, Egosoft hired an experienced game and TV writer, Andrew S. Walsh.\n\n\"X3: Reunion\" picks up where X2 left off—the Kha'ak are assaulting all areas of the X Universe, and Julian's father, Kyle, is still in a coma after being rescued from the Kha'ak. The player is then involved in an intricate plot, revealing the reason for the Kha'ak attack, the quest to open a portal to Earth with special gem artifacts, the introduction of a mysterious alien race, Kyle's re-awakening, and the arrival of Terran (Earth) forces in the X Universe.\n\nA mysterious alien only referred to as \"Sargon\" manipulates events during the story. A Goner named \"Ion\" tasks Julian with finding three crystals and an artifact referred to as the \"seed\" to help open a gate to Earth. During the storyline, Julian meets the pirate \"Don Toni Marani\" and his daughter, who help in later missions. Ion attempts to run off with the artifacts once he gets them, but when captured he reveals he was being manipulated by Sargon. Kyle re-awakens from his coma; however, his brain waves are still linked to the Kha'ak, leading them to conduct another assault in Paranid space. The Argon Federation declare Kyle to be an enemy to appease the Paranid.\n\nJulian is also marked an enemy by the Argon Federation, hoping to avoid a war with the Paranid, who accuse Julian of committing crimes in their territory. The Paranid are finally revealed to have provoked the Kha'ak into attacking the races of the X-Universe, after one of their scouting missions found the Kha'ak's home world. The Paranid also have been strip mining the valuable Nividium asteroids, which further anger the Kha'ak, who make their homes from Nividium. The mined Nividium alongside synthesised versions of the artifacts were being fashioned into jump gates, by which the Paranid hoped to manipulate the economy.\n\nA gate to Earth is opened, which Kyle passes through, causing the Kha'ak to discover it. They try to go through it and fight a combined Teladi, Boron and Argon fleet led by Ban Danna, inflicting large casualties. Julian and Ion try to stabilise the gate with the Teladi station, which sends them both through it, killing Ion. Julian survives and finds himself floating at a gate near Earth, with a massive fleet moving towards him. It is the Terran fleet, and with Kyle and Julian on board it passes through the jump hole and helps the overwhelmed defenders against the Kha'ak. The Terrans afterwards harbor distrust towards the X Universe races, even the Argon humans, prompting Kyle to return to Earth to try to correct the situation. Julian is released, pardoned of his crimes by the Argon Federation and the Paranid Empire, and the player is left to do whatever he wants in the post-plot universe.\n\n\"X3: Reunion\" was developed by Egosoft and published by Deep Silver. It began as project \"X2: The Return\", Egosoft's planned extension for \"X2: The Threat\". However, as the project advanced, it soon outgrew the constraints of the \"X2\" Engine. In April 2005, Egosoft announced that \"X2: The Return\" was cancelled and that the game, using the new \"X3\" Engine, would become \"X3: Reunion\". A month later, they demonstrated the power of the \"\"X3 Reality Engine\"\" in May 2005's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), stunning industry insiders with high-definition moving renders of space stations, planets and other scenes. \"X3\" was released later in October.\n\n\"X3: Reunion\" was released five months after the E3 in the EU on October 28, 2005 for Windows and on November 4, 2005 in North America. The game has been later ported to Linux and Mac OS X; Mac OS X for release in August 2007; the Linux version followed on December 5 2008.\n\nThe game was also intended to be Egosoft's first multiplatform release on both Windows and Xbox. However, shortly before release it was announced that the Xbox version had been cancelled. No Xbox version is available.\n\nThe original retail release version of \"X3: Reunion\" was plagued by a number of bugs and issues - including a bug which prevented the player from completing the game.\n\nSubsequently, Egosoft released a series of patches, first to resolve problems and later to add new features, expanding the game. Patches 1.2 to 1.4 were primarily aimed at eliminating bugs, improving performance and resolving compatibility issues.\n\nOn December 31, 2005, an updated manual was released for the game in a PDF file. This can be obtained from the downloads section of the official page. At 97 pages long, it is 16 pages longer than the first version. It contains information about the changes in the v1.4 patch, and corrections to errors in the earlier manual that shipped with the game.\n\nOn July 22, 2006 both X3 and its predecessor X2 became available via Valve's Steam online content delivery system, with the StarForce copy protection system removed. The in November 2015 released version on online content delivery system gog.com is fully DRM-free.\n\nOn November 11, 2006 Egosoft released version 2.0.01 of \"X3: Reunion\" including the Bala Gi Expansion. This contained many new ships, features, new sectors and further bug fixes. Bala Gi's missions are available to players who have logged 10 game hours, have at least 5 million credits on account, have a good reputation with the Boron, are not an enemy of the Split or Paranid, and own at least one station. Rewards include the Player Headquarters, the unique M7 frigate class prototype ship the Hyperion, and the ability to build the new M3+ class of Heavy Fighters. The availability of these missions is not dependent on the main plot and saved games from previous versions are able to receive the new missions and mission rewards.\n\nThe game itself was relaunched as a budget PC DVD-ROM titled \"X3 Reunion 2.0\". The re-release has the 2.0 patch already applied, and contains no trace of StarForce Copy Protection.\nThe original version of \"X3: Reunion\" for Mac OS X used the \"Cider\" \"wrapper\" technology developed by Transgaming. On June 29, 2010, Virtual Programming issued a new version of the game that eschewed Cider. Virtual Programming CEO Mark Hinton was quoted as saying: \"We weren't happy with X3: Reunion's performance when using Cider, and it turned out many of our customers weren't either. As a gesture of goodwill, we reengineered the game as a native port that's a free update for existing customers. Starting today, new X3: Reunion customers will receive the updated version of the game.\"\n\nOn August 16, 2010, the \"X Superbox\" was announced by Deep Silver and Egosoft, which includes all of the games from the X Series.\n\n\"X3\" first showed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in May 2005, where it received considerable praise for its visuals, described as \"beautiful\" (GameSpot), \"all very stylish and sharp\" (IGN), and \"by far the most visually impressive game at the booth.\" (The Inquirer)\n\nOn release, the response was mixed. Some sources praised its vision, freedom and scope, but others complained of a buggy implementation, under-performance, and a steep learning curve.\n\nPC Zone hailed it as \"one of the few games that has the power to engage your imagination with pretty pictures, then actually live up to your imaginings when you get your hands on it\". and GameZone gave it \"Editor's Choice\", calling it \"a bona fide winner\". However, GameSpy asked \"How much slack can you give a game that in many ways manages to achieve [its] lofty goal, but buries it under a painfully incomplete implementation?\". Reviewers complained of low frame rates, frequent crashes, and bugs that made it impossible to complete the game; \"the game was simply unplayable out of the box\". \"[I]t's not that X3 is a bad game, or that it isn't fun - it just isn't done.\" Complaints were also made about its complicated interface, exacerbated by an unhelpful manual which references \"features and options that aren't even in the final version\".\n\nOn the review aggregator GameRankings, it has an average score of 75% based on 39 reviews. On Metacritic, the game has an average score of 71 out of 100, based on 32 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.\n\nWhile post-release reviews consistently criticised \"X3\"s numerous bugs and poor performance, Egosoft's released series of patches and an improved manual addressed these issues mostly. \"Three patches on,\" Computer Gaming World's Matt Peckham wrote, \"something nigh-miraculous occurred: With doubled performance and many of the mission-busting bugs fixed, X3 evolved from a Byzantine hodgepodge to an actually accessible, massively multiform space sim. The bottom line: It's back on my hard drive, this time to stay\".\n\n\"X3: Reunion\" was named around 2013 as one of the 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1954114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954114", "title": "Opus Dei and politics", "text": "Opus Dei and politics\n\nOpus Dei and politics is a discussion on Opus Dei's view on politics, its role in politics and its members involvement in politics. There were accusations that the Catholic personal prelature of Opus Dei has had links with far-right governments worldwide, including Franco's and Hitler's regimes. Recent studies meanwhile have done much to counter these claims, especially the work of John L. Allen, Jr. who spent a year studying the organization. He says that Josemaría Escrivá was staunchly nonpolitical, and that Opus Dei's cardinal principle is that \"it can never take political positions corporately. It would compromise the notion of secularity—that political thinking is something for lay people to do, not for a church organization to do. Therefore, on questions that don't deal with faith and morals, there's great pluralism.\"\n\nAllen states: \"two of the most visible Opus Dei politicians in the world—(Paola) Binetti (a senator-elect) in Italy, and Ruth Kelly, a former Minister of Education in England—are now women who belong to center-left parties,\" \"still there is a sociological reality that the kind of people attracted to Opus Dei tend to be conservative, theologically and politically.\"\n\nResearchers, historians and writers on Opus Dei have said that Opus Dei has a novel approach to political matters whereby Christians are free and personally responsible in temporal affairs. They have seen that Opus Dei members follow Escrivá's teachings: \"There are no dogmas in temporal matters.\" \"Respect for its members' freedom is an essential condition for Opus Dei's very existence,\" says Escrivá. \"If Opus Dei had been involved in politics, even for an instant,\" he once wrote, \"in that moment of error I would have left Opus Dei.\" (Le Tourneau 1989, p. 49)\n\nV. Messori says that Escrivá set up inviolable and perpetual rules to establish the essential conditions for Opus Dei's life. Among them is this clause from the Statutes: \"Each faithful of the Prelature enjoys the same liberties as other Catholic citizens in what concerns professional activity, social, political doctrines, etc. The authorities of the Prelature, however, must abstain from giving any counsel in matters of this nature. Therefore this full liberty can be diminished only by the norms that apply to all Catholics and are established by the bishop or Bishop's Conference.\" (88.3)\n\nAfter investigating into the actual implementation of these rules and spirit, Messori concludes that (1) the members of Opus Dei receive nothing else but spiritual advice, (2) they do not operate as a herd in political affairs, but (3) consider respect for pluralism in matters not concerning the faith one way of obeying a central conviction of the founder. (See Messori 1997, p. 175)\n\nMoreover, aside from those working on the right side of the political spectrum, there are numerous Opus Dei members in many others parts of the world, e.g. Latin America, Europe, Asia, who are involved in left-wing politics and organizations: labor unions, left-of-center political parties, organizations working for the marginalized, poverty alleviation and reduction programs, etc. It is impossible, according to supporters, for all of them to be herded into one political agenda.\n\nSome theologians and observers of religious phenomena also say that \nthe many criticisms against Opus Dei show that it is a sign of contradiction, \"a sign that is spoken against.\"\n\nOpus Dei has been accused of supporting Totalitarianism, during the first part of the 20th century, and afterward far-right governments. Opus Dei's history parallels that of Francisco Franco's conservative dictatorship in Spain, and was first developed during the troublesome years of the interwar period, along with the dictatorships of António de Oliveira Salazar and Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. Some of Franco's ministers were from Opus Dei.\n\nHowever, supporters of Opus Dei point out that accusations of support to Hitler, Franco or totalitarianism have been often based in scattered information and individual testimonies of former members of the organisation. They also note that the main position of the Socialist and Communist parties in the 1920s and 1930s was against organized religions, especially in mainly Catholic countries such as Spain, where the Church massively took side for Franco during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). These circumstances could make Opus Dei appear, on the one hand, closer to the Right Wing movements of the era; on the other, these could have overemphasized information that do not show an explicit or an implicit support of any of these dictatorships. Thus, some writers state that it is arguable that neither Josémaría Escrivá nor the Opus Dei organisation itself have ever explicitly supported totalitarianism of any kind and some writers state that there is no evidence whatsoever that Opus Dei was involved in any political action whether right-wing, left-wing or centre.\n\nThe Unofficial Opus Dei Webpage says: Father Vladimir Felzmann, an ex-Opus Dei member and leader, tells about a discussion with José Maria Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei : after he (Escrivá) insisted that with Hitler's help the Franco government had saved Christianity from Communism, he added: \"Hitler against the Jews, Hitler against the Slavs, this means Hitler against communism.\"\n- a statement that did not bar the way to subsequent sainthood. An article in the \"Telegraph\" also reports that Felzmann heard Escriva, \"Vlad, Hitler couldn't have been such a bad person,\" the Father apparently said. \"He couldn't have killed six million. It couldn't have been more than four million.\" Opus Dei supporters state that Fr. Felzmann, on saying these things, is being inconsistent with a testimony he wrote in 1980 saying that Escrivá is \"a saint for today.\" (\"Documentation Service\" Vol V, 3, March 1992) They claim that former members, called \"apostates\" by their former organization, often lend their voices to coalitions fighting their previous religious organizations (see Dr. Bryan R. Wilson).\n\nThe aforementioned testimony, particularly in regards to Judaisim, is negated by video evidence from 1975 in which Josemaría Escrivá mentions his \"love for the Jewish people\" . In addition, according to Opus Dei supporters, the one oral testimony regarding the supposed sympathies of Escrivá towards Hitler is negated by various documented testimonies of non-members and members who state that Escrivá vigorously condemned Hitler, whom he called \"an obsessed man, a rogue and tyrant.\" He also condemned Nazism for being a \"heresy,\" \"anti-Christian,\" \"pagan,\" \"totalitarian,\" \"a political aberration,\" and \"racist.\" About the Nazi persecution against the Christians and the Jews, he was reported to say: \"one victim is enough to condemn it\". (Urbano 1995, p. 118-199) He condemned it, even going against Spain's public and official attitude of keeping silent about Nazism, despite the Holy See's condemnation of Hitler's ideology. Thus, del Portillo, the Opus Dei prelate who succeeded Escrivá, said that the attacks against the founder of Opus Dei are \"a patent falsehood,\" part of \"a slanderous campaign.\" (del Portillo 1996, p. 22-25). Various Jewish officials, Opus Dei supporters say, also came out publicly to Escrivá's defense.\n\nOpus Dei was founded in 1928 by an Aragonese Roman Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá, and it was subsequently recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as its first secular religious institution, then later a personal prelature, a secular jurisdictional structure of the Catholic Church akin to a diocese. Although attention has been drawn primarily to its activities in Spain, it is an international body with members and associates throughout the world. Members make a commitment to dedicate their professional talents to the service of God and to seek to win converts through their missionary zeal. The organization in Spain and everywhere else has emphasized professional excellence, whether they are farmers or teachers, and it has expected its members who have talents for politics to serve in government positions, in accord, it says, with the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThere are many history books and books written by investigative journalists, particularly those written outside Spain like the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy, which agree that Opus Dei was and continues to be \"apolitical\", meaning that Opus Dei has no purposeful strategy as a whole or secret agenda as some have suspected. John Allen (2005), an American journalist, drawing from the latest historical research, said that \"some members worked in Franco's Spain, became ministers of his. But Opus Dei people are free to do whatever they wish politically. Other members were against Franco.\" Allen cites the dissident Rafael Calvo Serer, who was driven into exile in the early 70s and saw the newspaper he published closed by the government. Allen confirms that by the latter stages of the Franco era, Opus Dei members in Spain were divided \"50/50\" over the regime.\n\nAllen also recounts the story of Giovanni Benelli and Josemaría Escrivá. Cardinal Benelli - right-hand man of Paul VI- wanted a Catholic Party in Spain similar to Italy's Democrazia Cristiana and wanted all Spanish Roman Catholics to adhere to this policy. Escrivá, who was truly desperate in asking the help of Benelli to talk to Paul VI about the foremost concern in his mind, the juridical problem of Opus Dei which can be resolved by becoming a \"personal prelature\" status for Opus Dei, refused Benelli. And he later complained to Benelli for holding Opus Dei hostage so Benelli could have his way. Allen says: \"The Benelli story offers a good case for testing whether Escriva was serious about Opus Dei having no political agenda. If ever there was a set of circumstances propitious for a \"power grab\", this situation presented them. ...If Opus Dei led the way in the creation of Spanish version of Christian Democracy, its imaginable that its total of 8 ministers in 36 years under Franco would have been swamped by its representation in a new Spanish government.\"\n\nCritics, however, point to a letter written on 23 May 1958 by Escrivá to General Francisco Franco, dictator of Spain. They also say that Escrivá supported Franco. On the other hand, members of Opus Dei say that the letter of Escrivá (written 8 years after the US, the UN and Allies recognized Franco) shows his exemplary virtues as a citizen and a Catholic priest, as he says: \"Although a stranger to any political activity, I cannot help but rejoice as a priest and Spaniard\" that Spain's Head of State should proclaim that Spain accepts the law of God according to the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, a faith which will inspire its legislation. Escrivá tells him that \"It is in fidelity to our people's Catholic tradition that the best guarantee of success in acts of government, the certainty of a just and lasting peace within the national community... will always be found.\" According to supporters, by saying this Escrivá was encouraging Franco (together with hundreds of Spaniards who wrote to Franco) to respect human rights, human dignity and freedom. They say that Escrivá acknowledged Franco's role in bringing order to the country but he totally rejected any form of clericalism whereby Catholics have a single-party mentality or use public power as a secular arm of the Church. Supporters also refer to an immediate correction given by Escrivá to Franco when one of the numeraries was insulted by the regime as \"a person without a family.\" (del Portillo, 1996, p. 25-28) However, historians agree that the Catholic Church, of which Escrivá was a member, was a bulwark of the Franco regime, notwithstanding the dictatorship's brutal repression against Republicans and Communists following the Spanish Civil War.\n\nJohn Allen in \"Opus Dei: Secrets and Power in the Catholic Church\" (2005) states that from the very beginning to the end of the Franco regime Escrivá maintained a complete silence about Franco's government. He claims that there is not one public statement on the records from Escriva — either critical of the regime or in favor. In the 1930s and 1940s, this silence was even interpreted as passive opposition. By the 1960s and 1970s, when the overwhelming sentiment in Spanish Roman Catholicism had become critical of Franco, his silence was interpreted as a kind of covert support. This silence, according to Allen, meant there was no corporate position of Opus Dei towards Franco.\n\n“[I]t’s worth noting that in the context of the Spanish Civil War, in which anticlerical Republican forces killed 13 bishops, 4,000 diocesan priests, 2,000 male religious, and 300 nuns, virtually every group and layer of life in the Catholic Church in Spain was ‘pro-Franco.’” Allen goes on to note that despite this fact, “there is no instance in which [Escrivá] either praised or criticized the regime” throughout its long reign. “In the 1930s and 1940s, when the overwhelming sentiment in Catholic Spain was pro-Franco, Escrivá’s silence was therefore often read to betoken a hidden liberalism; by the 1960s and 1970s, when Catholic opinion had shifted, that same silence was interpreted as masking a pro-Franco conservatism,” he writes. “The overall impression one gets is that Escrivá strove to maintain neutrality with respect to the Franco regime, even if privately he felt some sympathy for a leader trying by his lights to be an upright Christian,” Mr. Allen concludes. “A charge of ‘pro-Franco’ cannot be sustained, except in the generic sense that most Spanish Catholics were initially supportive of Franco... The most one can say is that Escrivá was not ‘anti-Franco’ either.”\n\nCritics underline that several Opus Dei members were appointed ministers in General Francisco Franco's government. They say that this is evidence of the organization's penetration into the highest echelons of Spain's Fascist regime. Others note the origins of Opus Dei itself and the decision of its founder, Escrivá de Balaguer, to flee first to France during the Spanish Civil War and then to join the insurgent generals in Burgos, then capital for the rebels seeking to overthrow Spain's democratically elected leftist government. It is worth noting that Opus Dei's first offices in Madrid were in the same building as the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nTo cite the ministers who served under Franco as proof of the link between fascism and Opus Dei, is, according to Prof. Berglar, a gross calumny. First, because as hardworking professionals striving after excellence, many Opus Dei members had the personal qualifications to be appointed in government as technocrats assisting in the NATO-USA supported economic Spanish miracle. \"In 1957 Franco restructured his cabinet with a view to restoring the economy of Spain and guiding the nation toward a modern fiscal system. With such purposes in mind, he appointed a number of talented young bankers and economists,\" Berglar states. The technocrats who were members of Opus Dei, belonged to different persuasions. They were largely responsible for devising, introducing, and later administering the economic stabilization program that formed the basis of Spain's economic development. These technocrats encouraged competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth, and they favored economic integration with Europe. Although these policies implied eventual political as well as economic liberalization, this was not Opus Dei's avowed goal, for the group officially does not have any political goal.\n\nPaul Preston, one of the best known among the leading specialists on the Spanish Civil War and Franco, states the following: \"The arrival of the technocrats has been interpreted variously as a planned take-over by Opus Dei and a clever move by Franco to 'fill vacant seats in the latest round of musical chairs'. \"In fact, the arrival of the technocrats was neither sinister nor cunning but rather a piecemeal and pragmatic response to a specific set of problems. By the beginning of 1957, the regime faced political and economic bankruptcy. Franco and Carrero Blanco were looking for new blood and fresh ideas.\" To be acceptable, new men had to come from within the Movimiento, be Catholic, accepted the idea of an eventual return to the monarchy and be, in Francoist terms, apolitical. López Rodó, Navarro Rubio and Ullastres were ideal. López Rodó was the nominee of Carrero Blanco. The dynamic Navarro Rubio was the Caudillo's choice. Franco had known him since 1949. He was a Procurador en Cortes for the Sindicatos and had been highly recommended by the outgoing Minister of Agriculture, Rafael Cavestany. Both López Rodó and Navarro Rubio suggested Ullastres...Bright, hard-working functionaries were emerging who were more concerned to get top jobs in the state apparatus than to implement the ideology of Falangism. \"That was entirely true of men like López Rodó and Navarro Rubio who were labelled as being primarily of Opus Dei but were more accurately seen as being part of what came to be called the 'bureaucracy of number ones', those who had won competitive civil service examinations or university chairs while still very young.\"\" (Italics added)\n\nBrian Crozier also states: \"The charge that Opus Dei had been aiming at political power, and had achieved it at last, was heard in February 1957, when Ullastres and Navarro Rubio joined Franco’s cabinet. In this bare form, \"the charge seems to be unfounded because based on a misconception of what Opus Dei is.\" It is not, as its enemies either think or want others to think, a political party; nor is it a political pressure group. Nor, for that matter, is it a kind of super labour-exchange for politicians... What happened was more pragmatic and less sinister. \"Franco had heard of the intellectual and technical merits of Ullastres and Navarro Rubio and sent for them; they happened to be members of Opus Dei.\" On the same occasion, he had heard of the intellectual and technical merits of Castiella and Gual Villalbi and sent for them; but Castiella and Gual Villalbi happened not to be members of Opus Dei. \"In other words, Opus Dei was not a group to be conciliated by being given a share in power, as the Monarchists were, or the Falange, or the Army.\"\" (Italics added)\n\nMessori, who is not a member of Opus Dei, also states that there were only 8 members of Opus Dei (5 of whom served for only one term or but a few months) of the 116 ministers under Franco's regime, and they started serving only after 1956, a few years after the Allies recognized it. There was no Opus Dei member in his last cabinet. They were never a majority: \"The myth of an Opus Dei dominated Franco government is just that--a myth\" (Messori 1997, p. 30) (Berglar 1994, p. 186). \n\nA number of historians say that there were members who were sentenced to prison or left Spain under Franco because they did not agree with the politics of Franco and his regime. (See ) Antonio Fontán and Rafael Calvo Serer are examples of journalists who fought for democracy and press freedom and were persecuted by Franco's Regime. Antonio Fontan would later become the Senate President. Falangists, the main political organization supporting Franco, suspected Escrivá of \"internationalism, anti-Spanish sentiment, and freemasonry,\" according to Berglar, who states that \"during \"the first decade of Franco's regime, Opus Dei and Escrivá were attacked with perseverance bordering on fanaticism, not by enemies but by supporters of the new Spanish state\". Escrivá was even reported to the 'Tribunal for the Fight against Freemasonry.'\" (Berglar 1994, p.180-181; see also Vasquez de Prada 1997).\n\nInvestigative journalist John Allen, who is not a member of Opus Dei, supports Berglar's statements. John Allen also says that there were Opus Dei priests who were involved in opposition movements. He also states that the only Spanish bishop who was put in jail during the Franco era is one of the two Opus Dei cardinals, Cardinal Julián Herranz, who was a young Opus Dei layman at that time fighting for agrarian revolution in Andalusia, Spain.\n\nAllen also states that Opus Dei members (sociologically speaking and not institutionally speaking) acted towards Franco as all Spanish Catholics would. Sociologically at the beginning of Franco's regime, they hailed him as a savior who liberated them from the communism and anarchism of the Second Spanish Republic; this attitude evolve through time and in the end, like most Catholics, they were 50-50 for Franco. At present many Opus Dei members are politically conservative, but rather in the sense of Christian Democracy than in the sense of Clero-Fascism.\n\nJournalists John L. Allen, Jr. and Vittorio Messori claim that Opus Dei as an institution was neither pro-Franco nor anti-Franco. It was \"savagely attacked\" says Allen by its enemies, starting with certain Jesuits immediately after the civil war. These Jesuits did not understand the novelty of its theological doctrine on the universal call to holiness, says Allen. And, according to Messori, its reputation was besmirched deliberately by some groups of the Falange for they wrongly viewed it as a political rival, since these Spaniards tended to have a Catholic one-party mentality in politics, and did not understand Escriva's new doctrine on the freedom and responsibility of each Catholic in temporal matters. They failed to see, says Messori, that there were many other members of Opus Dei who were against the Franco Regime, like Rafael Calvo Serrer and Antonio Fontán. This deliberate campaign of the Falange led to the Black Legend that Opus Dei is a type of political party, he says. Brian Crozier, an English historian, says that \"Opus Dei is neither a political party nor a political pressure group as its enemies want people to believe.\" Messori says that Opus Dei's fidelity to the Catholic faith makes it capable of new ideas and its members contributors for the advancement of society.\n\nPope John Paul II, who viewed the orthodox Catholicism of the organization with favor, established it as personal prelature, a part of the socio-administrative organization of the Catholic Church. Escriva claimed in interviews in the 1960s that the influence of Opus Dei was not socio-economic but ethical. He declared that Opus Dei goal is for rich and poor to work together in building a more just, more human and more progressive society. Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer was beatified by John Paul II, a choice which has been criticized by progressive sectors of the Church.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1954123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954123", "title": "Atlanta Chiefs", "text": "Atlanta Chiefs\n\nThe Atlanta Chiefs were an American professional soccer team based in Atlanta, Georgia. The team competed in the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) in 1967 and the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1968 to 1973 and again from 1979 to 1981. For the 1973 season, the team played as the Atlanta Apollos.\n\nFounded in 1967 as a charter member of the NPSL, the club was the brainchild of Dick Cecil, then Vice President of the Atlanta Braves baseball franchise who was the Chiefs' owners. Cecil was intrigued with the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England and decided that a professional soccer team would add valuable events for Atlanta Stadium. From 1967 to 1972, the stadium would serve as the Chiefs' home field for all seasons except 1970, when the Chiefs played their home games at Tara Stadium.\n\nIn 1973, the team was sold and rebranded as the Atlanta Apollos. They played their home games at Grant Field before folding at the end of the 1973 season. The Chiefs' brand would later be revived by Cecil and Ted Turner in 1979 after the Colorado Caribous of the NASL relocated to Atlanta. The Chiefs again played at Atlanta—Fulton County Stadium, as well as the Omni Coliseum for two seasons of indoor soccer before the franchise again folded in 1981.\n\nKaizer Chiefs F.C., a professional soccer team that plays in the South African Premier Soccer League, was founded by Kaizer Motaung, who played for the Atlanta Chiefs in their initial incarnation. The Kaizer Chiefs' name and logo were inspired by those of the Atlanta club.\n\nThe idea for a professional soccer team in Atlanta was first posed by Dick Cecil in 1966, who at the time was the Vice President of the Atlanta Braves, a member club of Major League Baseball (MLB). While Cecil had never before seen a soccer match, he became intrigued by the sport after reading accounts of the 1966 FIFA World Cup and became convinced that soccer games could be a profitable draw for the recently built Atlanta Stadium, which also served as the Braves' home stadium. The Chiefs were one of several professional sports teams to begin play in Atlanta during the late 1960s, which also included the Braves (MLB, 1966), the Atlanta Falcons (NFL, 1966), and the Atlanta Hawks (NBA, 1968).\n\nIn 1966, under Cecil's direction, the Atlanta Braves chartered a franchise in the newly created National Professional Soccer League. The team name was chosen based on its association with the Braves, which like the Chiefs also used Native American imagery in their branding. On September 8, Cecil made one of the first hires on the team with Phil Woosnam as head coach and player. Team tryouts were held on the campus of Emory University, which also housed the Chiefs' training facility. The initial roster included notable international players such as Vic Crowe, Peter McParland, and Vic Rouse. The Chiefs opened their first season with an away game against the Baltimore Bays on April 16, 1967. The game, a 1–0 loss for the Chiefs, is notable for being the first professional soccer match to be televised in the United States. Before the game, the players on both teams were introduced holding flags of the countries they were from, and a band played \"Dixie\" prior to kick-off. The Chiefs would finish their debut season with a win–loss–tie record of 10–9–12. Following the 1967 season, the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League.\n\nIn 1968, the Chiefs hosted two exhibition matches against Manchester City F.C. of the Football League First Division, which at the time was the top tier in the English football league system. In the first game, held May 28, the Chiefs upset City 3–2. Shortly after the defeat, assistant manager of Manchester City Malcolm Allison said of the Atlanta team, \"They couldn't play in the fourth division in England.\" Following the loss, Manchester City requested a rematch, which was held June 15 and saw the Chiefs again beat the visiting team, this time 2–1. Addressing the upset status of these two games, Atlanta Chiefs captain Ray Bloomfield, an Englishman, said, \"It would be like some of your boys coming over here to play American football and then beating the team that won the Super Bowl.\" That same season, the Chiefs would host Santos FC in an August 28 match, losing to the Brazilian team 6–2 in front of over 25,000 attendees, which was at the time the largest crowd for a soccer game in Atlanta. Notably, Pelé played in the game several years before he would join the New York Cosmos of the NASL in 1975.\n\nThe Chiefs capped off the 1968 season by defeating the San Diego Toros in the NASL Final 1968 at Atlanta Stadium in front of approximately 15,000 spectators. In doing so, they became both the first champions of the NASL as well as the first professional sports franchise in Atlanta to win a championship. Atlanta would not host another championship-winning professional sports team until the Atlanta Braves won the 1995 World Series, and the city would not see another championship soccer team until Atlanta United FC won the MLS Cup 2018. Following the championship, state representative Elliott H. Levitas issued a congratulatory proclamation from the Georgia General Assembly, and players on the team were given championship rings by Braves owners, which is fairly common in North American sports, but was uncommon in soccer.\n\nFollowing the 1968 season, Woosnam left the team to become the commissioner of the NASL. He was succeeded as team manager by Rouse.\n\nFollowing the 1968 season, the NASL experienced a period of sharp decline. Between the 1968 and 1969 seasons, 12 of the 17 teams of the NASL had folded, and the television contract the league had with CBS had expired. With only five teams remaining in the league, the 1969 season was split into two halves. The first half, called the International Cup, was a double round robin tournament in which the remaining NASL clubs were represented by teams imported from the United Kingdom. The Chiefs were represented by Aston Villa F.C.. The team tied for third in the Cup with a 2–4–2 record. For the second half of the 1969 season, the teams returned to their normal rosters and played a 16 game schedule with no playoffs. The Chiefs, with an 11–2–3 record, were declared runners-up to the Kansas City Spurs in the NASL Final 1969 who, despite having a worse record than the Chiefs, narrowly edged out the Atlanta team in points that season.\n\nAfter the 1969 season, the high cost of operation at Atlanta Stadium led the team to seek a new home venue. Initially, DeKalb Memorial Stadium was selected as the home venue, but after negotiations fell through, Tara Stadium in nearby Clayton County was selected and would serve as the Chiefs' home venue for the 1970 season. The Chiefs would return to Atlanta Stadium for the subsequent season. Also in 1970, Sonny Carter became the first American-born player to sign with the team, having previously played the sport for Emory's collegiate team. The 1971 season saw the Chiefs win their division and advance to the NASL Final 1971, where they lost to the Dallas Tornado.\n\nAfter the 1972 season, the team owners sold the team to the owners of the Atlanta Hawks. After the sale, the team was renamed the Atlanta Apollos and played their home games at Grant Field on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology for the 1973 season. The Apollos experienced their worst season in franchise history in 1973, posting a 3–7–9 record just two seasons removed from playing for the championship. Following the 1973 season, the franchise folded.\n\nThe Chiefs brand would remain dormant for several years until the name and logo (altered slightly) were revived in 1979 when the Colorado Caribous franchise moved to Atlanta, with Cecil and Ted Turner as owners. Turner had purchased the Caribous franchise for $1.5 million and relocated them following a conversation he had with Cecil about the sport. This new franchise included notable players such as Victor Nogueira, Adrian Brooks, Mark MacKain, Carl Strong, Webster Lichaba, Jomo Sono, and Louis and George Nanchoff. After the 1979 season, David Chadwick was hired away from the Fort Lauderdale Strikers to serve as team manager. Keith Furphy was also traded to the Chiefs from the Detroit Express before the 1980 season. After an abysmal 7–25 season in 1980, Chadwick brought Brian Kidd to the team on a loan from Bolton Wanderers F.C. While the team's prospect improved during the 1981 season, including increased attendance and a division championship, a lack of profitability led Turner to pull the plug on the team after that season. For these three seasons the team once again played at Atlanta Stadium (by this time renamed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium), while also playing at Omni Coliseum for two NASL Indoor seasons.\n\nOne of the biggest legacies of the Chiefs was introducing the game of soccer to the people of Atlanta and the surrounding region. According to a 1968 report by the Chiefs, at the time of the team's arrival in Atlanta, fewer than 150 people in the city were playing organized soccer, a number which had grown to about 16,000 by mid-1968. Furthermore, the Chiefs are purported to have held over 390 soccer clinics throughout the state during their existence. These extensive outreach efforts, primarily lead by Woosnam, also lead to the creation of the Atlanta District Amateur Soccer League and the soccer program at Georgia State University.\n\nKaizer Chiefs F.C. of the South African Premier Soccer League was founded in 1970 by Kaizer Motaung, who had played for the Atlanta Chiefs in the 1968 and 1969 seasons. Motaung based the name and logo of the team on that of the Atlanta franchise. Addressing this, Motaung stated that, \"We wanted to model ourselves against what my experiences were in Atlanta.\"\n\nNASL Championships (1)\n\nNASL Regular Season Premierships (1)\n\nDivision Titles (5)\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nLeague Goal Scoring Champion\n\nLeague Scoring Champion\n\nAll-Star First Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Second Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Honorable Mentions\n\nU.S. Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nIndoor Soccer Hall of Fame\n\n"}
{"id": "1954144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954144", "title": "Philippine Coast Guard", "text": "Philippine Coast Guard\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) (Filipino: \"Tanod Baybayin ng Pilipinas\") is an armed and uniformed service tasked primarily with enforcing laws within Philippine waters, conducting maritime security operations, safeguarding life and property at sea, and protecting marine environment and resources; similar to coast guards around the world. The Coast Guard also serves as an attached service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in wartime.\n\nIt is an agency attached to the Department of Transportation of the Philippines. It currently maintains a presence throughout the archipelago, with thirteen Coast Guard Districts, fifty-four CG Stations and over one hundred ninety Coast Guard Sub-Stations, from Basco, Batanes to Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard is the oldest and only humanitarian armed service in the Philippines. Its beginnings could be traced back to the early 20th century when coast guarding was related to the protection of the customs services of the country and in patrolling the coastlines and harbors.\n\nWhen the Americans came in 1898, one of the first steps that the military government undertook was the reopening of the port and customs facilities of Manila. Soon after, the civilian Insular Government, through the Philippine Commission, enacted a law on October 17, 1901 that created the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation, which was placed under the Department of Commerce and Police. The Captain of the Port was designated as Bureau Director.\n\nRecognition of the difficulty of administering such a vast island area without reliable government transportation resulted in the requirements to establish a transportation system for government services. The resulting report recommended purchase of 21 small steamers to establish 21 circuits supporting communication between provincial capitals and coastal towns as well as prevent smuggling and landing contraband. The average circuit would be . . The vessels required should be all weather of about in length capable of with light armament. Two small stern paddle steamers were recommended for river use on the Cayagen River and the Rio Grande de Mindanao and connected lakes. The bureau concentrated its early days on the contracts for the fifteen vessels with the result ten were to be built by Farnham, Boyd & Company in Shanghai, China and five by Uraga Dock Company in Uraga, Japan.\n\nThe ten Chinese contracted cutters were \"Balabac\", \"Basilan\", \"Busuanga\", \"Corregidor\", \"Luzon\", \"Masbate\", \"Negros\", \"Palawan\", \"Polillo\", and \"Tablas\". The five Uraga cutters were to be \"Marinduque\" and \"Romblon\", which were delivered, and \"Bohol\", \"Cebu\", and \"Jolo\" which were cancelled after serious deficiencies were found on delivery of \"Marinduque\" and \"Romblon\". The China built cutters began arriving in Manila by mid 1902 and were found to generally meet requirements. The Uraga built cutters, arriving in January and April 1903, had serious defects, to the extent the inspector in Japan was dismissed for negligence, and costly negotiations led to cancellation of the three others that were in process of completion. Five additional cutters were ordered from China, those being \"Leyte\", \"Mindanao\", \"Mindoro\", \"Panay\", and \"Samar\".\n\nThe lighthouse service was placed under the Bureau. In 1902, the Coast Guard fleet of 15 steamers from China and Japan was established and were assigned for the lighthouse service inspection trips of top government officials, for transport to Culion Island, for patrolling against illegal entry of aliens, and for troop movement of the Philippine Constabulary.\n\nThe Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation was abolished on October 26, 1905 and the Bureau of Navigation took over its functions. The Bureau of Navigation was authorized to create a commissioned and enlisted service, and to adopt its own manual of court martial patterned after the US Navy.\n\nSubsequently, however, the Bureau was also abolished on December 19, 1913 and the organization and its functions were transferred to the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Public Works until the establishment of the Commonwealth Government. After gaining independence from the United States, the Philippine government ceded some of the coast guard functions, such as the revenue cutter and lighthouse services, to the Philippine Naval Patrol, which eventually became the Philippine Navy. A Coast Guard unit was activated within the Philippine Navy to implement these functions.\n\nOn August 6, 1967, the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act 5173 of the Philippine Coast Guard Law, which made the PCG a major unit of the Philippine Navy under a flag officer. The PCG was activated on October 10, 1967 and its coast guard functions were transferred from the navy.\n\nThe civilian nature of the PCG functions led to the separation of the Coast Guard from the Philippine Navy on March 30, 1998 by virtue of Executive Order 475 signed by President Fidel Ramos. It order effectively transferred the PCG from the Department of National Defense to the Office of the President, and eventually to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) on April 15, 1998 by virtue of Executive Order 477.\n\nThese executive orders provided inter alia that the PCG shall continue to the agency primarily responsible for the promotion of safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the maritime environment as mandated under the Philippine Coast Guard Law and Presidential Decrees 600, 601, 602, and 979, as a mended.\n\nThe transformation of the PCG into a non-military organization has a tremendous impact and significance. Its civilian character has allowed it to receive offers of vessels, equipment, technology, services, cooperation and other needed assistance from other countries, something which would not be readily offered to a military agency.\n\nWith enactment of Republic Act 9993, also known as the Coast Guard Law of 2009, as well as its implementing rules and regulations, the PCG has been vested with the necessary authority and responsibility to perform preventive measures in ensuring the safety of merchant vessels. The new law also strengthened PCG's authority to meet new challenges and increasing demands for marine resources, technological advancement and climate change. Further, the law has defined the PCG's rightful niche in the bureaucracy as the premier maritime agency and its vital role in nation building.\n\nCommissioned Officer Ranks\n\n\nNon Commissioned Officer/Enlisted Ranks\n\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard's functional command units include:\n\nThe PCG used to be with the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the Philippine Navy before it was transferred to the Department of Transportation. The PCG is considered the third armed and uniformed service of the country primarily tasked with enforcing all applicable laws within the Philippine waters, conducting maritime security operations, safeguarding of life and property at sea and protecting the marine environment and resources. \n\nDue to the M/V Super Ferry 14 bombing incident in 2004, the PCG activated the Task Force Sea Marshals a composite team from the PCG, AFP and Philippine National Police. These Sea Marshals ride on many passenger ferries traveling to and from Manila, and maintain a security presence aboard these ferries.\n\nThe Coast Guard Aviation Force (CGAF), then known as Coast Guard Air Group was formally activated on May 18, 1998 during the incumbency of Commodore Manuel I de Leon PCG as Commandant, Philippine Coast Guard. Accordingly, Commander Noel O Monte PCG was designated as its first Commander holding office at the former PADC Hangar Nr. 3, Domestic Airport Complex, Pasay City.\n\nOn January 22, 1999, after eight months of existence, PCGAG acquired its first aircraft, a BN Islander from the Philippine National Oil Company – Energy Development Corporation (PNOC – EDC). After six months of intensive inspection and rehabilitation, it was commissioned into Coast Guard service on June 26, 1999 as PCG–251. On June 1999, the first helicopter, a MBB BO-105CB was acquired from PADC and commissioned with the tail number PCG–1636. Another aircraft, a Cessna 421B \"Golden Eagle\" was acquired without cost from the Bureau of Soils and Water Management sometime in the early part of 2000. However, due to budgetary constraints, the aircraft rehabilitation is not yet completed to date. In the same year, another BN Islander with the tail number PCG–684 was acquired. It was commissioned and activated on June 2002 after it underwent rehabilitation. On March 30, 2001, the helm of the CGAG was transferred to Captain Lino H Dabi PCG. In search of a bigger home for its growing inventory, on November 21, 2002, with the support of Pantaleon Alvarez, the Secretary of Transportation and Communications, the Manila International Airport Authority allowed CGAG to occupy its present location. Extensive renovation work was undertaken to make the hangar suitable as the nerve center of all Coast Guard Air Operations. On March 28, 2003, the CGAG acquired another BO – 105C helicopter from PADC and was commissioned into the service as PCG – 163 during the Group's 5th Founding Anniversary.\n\nWith the intense need to have the capability to extract survivors from water, the said helicopter was fitted with a rescue hoist through the courtesy of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Another significant milestone unfolded in the history of the group when PCG leadership was turned over to Vice Admiral Arthur Gosingan PCG. Through the endorsement of the CGOF Commander, Rear Admiral Damian Carlos PCG in recognizing the importance of the air unit in coast guard operations and their outstanding accomplishments granted the aviators their most aspired yearning of their careers by approving the group's position paper on the Command Pilot Rating. This enabled aviators to have an equal opportunity with officers that acquired a Command at a Sea Badge to assume positions of higher responsibilities in the Coast Guard hierarchy.\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard's Special Operations Force (CGSOF) is the special forces unit of the Philippine Coast Guard. It performs underwater operations, domestic counter-terrorism and other law enforcement operations. Their notable accomplishments include the operations to the Laoag Air crash at Manila Bay, the aftermath of the 2004 M/V Super Ferry 14 bombing and the Search and Recovery operations to the ill-fated M/V Princess of the Stars incident.\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary is the civilian support group of the Philippine Coast Guard. Although a volunteer, civilian organization, the PCGA uses a military structure for organizational purposes. Like other volunteer sea rescue organizations around the world, it performs non-military and non-police activities in support of its national navy or coast guard. This endeavor includes search and rescue, environmental protection, disaster relief, community service, and marine safety.\n\nThe ranks of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary follow those of the Philippine Coast Guard.\n\nNote: the PCGA should not be confused to be similar or equivalent to any reserve unit of the military. Since military reservists go through actual pre-entry training and are assigned serial numbers which is kept for life and not maintained by membership fees paid on a yearly basis. Hence, PCGA members are called Auxiliarists.\n\n! style=\"text-align:left; background: #aabccc;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background: #aabccc;\"|Photo\n! style=\"text-align:left; background: #aabccc;\"|# of Ships\n! style=\"text-align:left; background: #aabccc;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left; background: #aabccc;\"|Note\n\nThe Project ensures that each of the Philippine Coast Guard's 12 Coast Guard District Headquarters will be assigned two Rubber Boats each for Rescue missions. Furthermore, all 63 Coast Guard Stations and the 237 Coast Guard Detachments will have one Aluminum Boat. Also, all 63 Coast Guard Stations will be equipped with one Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB). Other RHIBs and Rubber Boats will be assigned to PCG Special Units and Search and Rescue vessels.\n\nAll the 300 Aluminum Boats, 81 RHIBs and 50 Rubber Boats will be equipped with 2 units VHF handheld marine-type Radio, 2 units Operators' Life Vests, 6 units of Common Life Vests, 1 Megaphone and 4 units of Flares.\n\nIt is projected to minimize the instances when PCG personnel borrowing boats from fishermen, or other private entities to perform their duties during emergencies. This resulted in delays in the PCG's response time, making rescue operations less efficient.\n\nUnder this same project but under a different public bidding document, 15 units of M35 6×6 Trucks and 40 units rubber boats were purchased. 3 units of the trucks and all 40 rubber boat units are currently assigned with the National Headquarters of the PCG. The remaining 12 units of the M35 trucks are assigned to each of the 12 Coast Guard Districts. It is expected to further facilitate timely response to disaster situations.\n\nThe Project aims to strengthen and further develop the coast watch/patrol and search and rescue capabilities of Philippine Coast Guard by procuring additional patrol vessels. This will support the PCG in fulfilling its mandate and in complying with the international commitments of the Philippines on maritime safety, security and environmental protection. The vessels are to be deployed in ten (10) PCG Districts Manila, Tacloban, Zamboanga, Puerto Princesa, La Union, Iloilo, San Fernando (La Union), Davao, Legaspi and Cagayan de Oro.\n\nThis JICA Project supports PCG, who is responsible of Maritime Safety, to enhance its capabilities to quickly and appropriately respond to coastal maritime incidents, such as search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, etc., by providing Multi-Role Responsive Vessels (MRRVs), thereby increasing the vessel/maritime area rate of each of the 12 districts. The Project is also in line with development policy of the Philippines and assistance strategy of Japan. Therefore, it is relevant that JICA supports the implementation of the Project.\n\nDuring Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs visit to Philippines on January 2013, Minister Fumio Kishida underscored the role of Japan as the Philippines' strategic ally. In the conference, he stressed Japan would provide 10 patrol vessels to the Philippine Coast Guard on a loan basis.<ref name=\"www.timawa.net/forum\"></ref> Shinzo Abe confirmed that 10 patrol boats will be swiftly donated to the Coast Guard. President Aquino and Prime Minister Abe witnessed the signing of a $187-million (18.732 billion yen) loan for the Philippines’ acquisition of multi-role response vessels to boost the capability of its coast guard to conduct maritime patrols.\n\nThe project involves the acquisition of two (2) heavy weather, high endurance 94-meter Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), to provide the PCG with vessels with a cruising range capability of 4,000 nautical miles, can be used in Sea-State 6 (wave height of up to 6 meters) in rough sea condition, and are capable to conduct continuous maritime patrol up to 15 days at 15 knots. Each vessel, as claimed by PCG, will enable them to recover as much as 500 passengers in the event of a maritime disaster, as well as provide the country with wider maritime coverage for strategic and national security purposes.\nGiven these upgraded vessel capacities, the project now costs PhP8 billion and with the NEDA Board approval, are expected to be delivered by November 2020 and March 2021 for each vessel, respectively.\n\nThe project aims to strengthen the Philippine Coast Guard's capability to promote safety of life, protect the marine environment and enforce maritime laws through procurement of four brand new 24-meter OCEA FPV 72MKII patrol boats and one 82-meter 270 MKII offshore patrol vessel.\n\nThe budget from this project came from the loan balance of a French loan that financed the cancelled Greater Maritime Access Ports Project of the Arroyo administration.<ref name=\"GMA Ports/DOTC/France\"></ref>\n\nThe project involves the procurement of seven Maritime Disaster Response (MDR) helicopters for the Philippine Coast Guard to strengthen and expand their MDR capabilities during maritime incidents and natural disasters and calamities. The project will also involve the training of pilots and technical crew, procurement of mission equipment, procurement of maintenance tools and spare parts for five years, and the construction of hangars for the helicopters and offices for the pilots and technical crew. It was supposed to be funded by the Credit Agricole of Germany.\n\n\n"}

At the time they were 16 and 22, respectively. Such relationships were in vogue in pre-modern Japan, a tradition known as shudo. The love pact signed by the two, in University of Tokyo's Historical Archive, documents Shingen's pledge that he was not in, nor had any intentions of entering into, a sexual relationship with a certain other retainer, and asserts that \"since I want to be intimate with you\" he will in no way harm the boy, and calls upon the gods to be his guarantors. (Leupp, pp. 53–54)\n\nKōsaka is known as one of the three Danjō that served the Takeda family, along with Sanada Yukitaka and Hoshina Masatoshi (Danjō stands for a formal title, Danjōchū; 弾正忠). Among these three, Kōsaka was known as the \"Nige Danjō\" (逃げ弾正; literally, the fleeing Danjō), because of his cautious commanding and skillful retreats.\n\nAs the general in command of Kaizu castle, Kōsaka played an important role in the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima. He informed Takeda via signal fires of the movements of Uesugi Kenshin's army as it approached, and then led the sneak attack up Saijo-yama in order to drive Uesugi's men down to the plain where they could be surprised by Takeda's army. Even though that tactic failed, Kōsaka led his men back down the hill, attacking Uesugi's army from the rear, turning the tide of the battle.\n\nKōsaka Masanobu is known to have openly criticized Katsuyori numerous times. Because of this, Kosaka was forced to \"retire\" from service in 1578 and died later from illness.\n\n\n"}

Lucia Realtors were a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) from 1993 to 2010. Prior to joining the PBA, it played in the Philippine Basketball League (PBL) from 1987 to 1992.\n\nIn 2015, a new Sta. Lucia Realtors team debuted in the inaugural conference of the Pilipinas Commercial Basketball League (PCBL).\n\nThe Sta. Lucia Realtors began in the Philippine Amateur Basketball League (PABL) in 1986 PABL Filipino Cup, when it played as ESQ-Sta. Lucia, in partnership with ESQ Marketing. The following season, ESQ Marketing left the league and Sta. Lucia played as the Sta. Lucia Realtors. The PABL was renamed the Philippine Basketball League (PBL) in 1990. The Realtors won two PBL championships - the 1990 PBL Philippine Cup and the 1991-1992 PBL Maharlika Cup.\n\nThe franchise transferred to the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) by acquiring the franchise of Great Taste/Presto in 1992 and debuted in the 1993 season.\nPrior to their PBA debut, the franchise was left with a few holdovers from the old Presto lineup including Vergel Meneses, Bong Hawkins (later traded to Swift and Alaska, respectively), and Gerry Esplana. Other players who joined the team within the season (through trades and free agent signings) were Bong Alvarez, Ric Ric Marata, Jack Tanuan and Johnedel Cardel.\n\nSta. Lucia had the top pick in the draft and selected amateur star Zandro \"Jun\" Limpot of De La Salle University-Manila. With Limpot carrying the new Sta. Lucia team for the 1993 season, the Realtors managed to surprise everyone with a semi-finals appearance that led to a fourth-place finish in the All-Filipino Cup. Limpot was named as the Rookie of the Year after the season.\n\nOne of Sta. Lucia's first imports was Lambert Shell, who played during the Commissioner's Cup. The team's head coach during its first few years was former PBA coach Nat Canson.\n\nIn 1995, Sta. Lucia selected University of Santo Tomas star Dennis Espino as their first round draft pick. But his PBA debut was further delayed after suffering a nose injury during an exhibition game held in the Middle East.\n\nFilipino-American Chris Jackson and Jose Francisco were also acquired in the 1993 draft, veteran shooter Romy dela Rosa later joined the team to form a solid squad to complement Limpot and Espino.\n\nEspino managed to return to Sta. Lucia late in the season. The Realtors then copped a third-place trophy in the Governor's Cup.\n\nTwo more third-place finishes were collected by Sta. Lucia during the 1995 All-Filipino and Commissioner's Cups, with Frederick Pea as import. From 1996, Sta. Lucia captured another third-place finish in the Commissioner's Cup with Adonis Tierra as head coach.\n\nSta. Lucia's best year was in 1997 when the Realtors finished third in the All-Filipino Cup, and fourth in the Commissioner's Cup and Governor's Cup. The Realtors had Jason Webb as the third overall pick in the 1997 PBA Draft and Chot Reyes calling the shots.\n\nReyes left the team in 1998, replacing him was Derrick Pumaren, Limpot's former coach at La Salle and Magnolia in the PABL. Esplana and Jackson were later traded to Formula Shell for Ronnie Magsanoc. It was at this time when Magsanoc hit his 1,000 career three-pointer. The Realtors entered the semis of the All-Filipino Cup, but were defeated by San Miguel in a do-or-die match for the last Finals berth.\n\nThe Realtors struggled in the Commissioner's Cup with Ronnie Coleman, brother of then-Philadelphia 76ers forward Derrick Coleman, missing the quarterfinals. Espino and Limpot were later loaned to the Philippine Centennial Team and the Realtors continued to struggle in the Governor's Cup.\n\nIn 1999, Limpot and Espino returned for Sta. Lucia but lost Romy dela Rosa to the Metropolitan Basketball Association. The Realtors then added former MBA star and 1992 PBA MVP Ato Agustin with Tierra returning as the head coach. Still, the Realtors placed dead last in the All-Filipino Cup.\n\nFil-American Robert Parker and Parker's college teammate Kwan Johnson joined the team in the 1999 Commissioner's Cup. The addition of both Parker and Johnson revived the franchise and eventually led to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. However, it was proven that Parker was a fake Filipino-American and left the Philippines afterwards, leaving Johnson as Sta. Lucia's import for the Governor's Cup. Sta. Lucia owner Exy Robles and the Realtors management were charged by the government for hiring Parker. The charges were later dropped.\n\nThe departure of Parker left the Realtors to a struggling performance in the season-ending Governor's Cup. Johnson was eventually replaced by Joe Temple during the course of the tournament.\n\nBefore the 2000 season, Limpot was traded to the Barangay Ginebra Kings for Marlou Aquino, to solidify the big man position of the team. Former grand slam-winning coach Norman Black took over as Sta. Lucia's new coach. They also had the number-one pick in the draft and took University of the Philippines guard Paolo Mendoza. The Realtors made it to the quarterfinals of the All-Filipino Cup.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, Ansu Sesay was signed by Sta. Lucia as an import. After placing second in the eliminations, they made it to the championship series for the first time in franchise history, only to lose to the talented San Miguel Beermen in five games. Sesay was named as Best Import of the said tournament.\n\nWith Joe Temple as import for the Governor's Cup, the Realtors did not make it past the quarterfinals. The same results can be said to the 2001 All-Filipino Cup and Commissioner's Cup.\n\nHowever, in the Governor's Cup, Sta. Lucia signed Damian Owens as import, and the Realtors quickly dominated the tournament to secure their second finals appearance against the heavily favored San Miguel team.\n\nAfter both teams split their series in Game Four, the Realtors won both Games 5 and 6. Game Six was tightly contested. After San Miguel import Lamont Strothers tied the game at 72 with an off-balanced runner, Chris Tan hit a 24-foot three-pointer with three seconds remaining to give Sta. Lucia the lead for good. The Game 6 win gave them their first-ever PBA championship with a 75–72 win and a 4–2 series victory.\n\nOwens was then awarded the Best Import of the Conference while Gerard Francisco received the Finals Most Valuable Player award.\n\nIn 2002, Sta. Lucia was not able to return to the Finals in each of the three conferences, thus failing to defend their Governor's Cup crown. After the season, Norman Black announced his resignation as head coach of Sta. Lucia, replacing him with former Tanduay mentor and Black's chief assistant Alfrancis Chua.\n\nEven with the vast array of talent present in his squad, Chua failed to produce a championship in his tenure as the Realtors' coach.\n\nDuring the 2003 PBA Draft, Sta. Lucia shocked everyone by trading their fifth overall pick to Alaska for 1998 MVP and the Aces' star player Kenneth Duremdes. With Duremdes joining Aquino and Espino, the Realtors became one of the favorites to win any of the three conferences in the 29th season.\n\nHowever, Sta. Lucia placed fourth in the All-Filipino, did not qualify for the special PBA Invitational tournament, and placed another fourth-place finish in the Reinforced Conference. Espino and Aquino, however, made it to the Mythical Team during the annual awards.\n\nIn the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference, with former Purefoods import Derrick Brown as reinforcement, the Realtors blew a double-digit lead to lose to eventual champion Barangay Ginebra Kings in the wildcard knockout phase of the tournament. This caught the ire of Chua, who even brought the whole team to the Commissioner's Office to protest the way officiating was handled.\n\nThe Realtors were again eliminated in the wildcard phase of the 2004–2005 Philippine Cup after they were swept by San Miguel. In the 2005 Fiesta Conference, Sta. Lucia blew a twice-to-beat advantage in the wildcard phase and was eliminated by the soon departing Shell Turbo Chargers. Former Cincinnati Bearcat Ryan Fletcher was the Sta. Lucia import during the conference.\n\nIn the 2005 PBA Draft, Sta. Lucia used the second-overall pick to draft point guard Alex Cabagnot. Cabagnot had a solid performance in the 2005–2006 Fiesta Conference, along with former PBL refugee Chester Tolomia, but Sta. Lucia only managed to finish seventh in the classification phase. The Realtors were swept by Alaska in the quarterfinals, losing the two games by huge margins.\n\nThe Realtors finished with a 4–12 record in the classification phase of the Philippine Cup. The Realtors then played in the wildcard playoff phase. However, the Realtors won only one game during the wildcard phase and bowed out of the tournament with a 1–2 record, defeating Talk 'N Text in their final game of the season.\n\nIn the off-season, the Sta. Lucia management had a big dispute with their ace point guard Alex Cabagnot, after the latter returned to the United States before a scheduled postseason team meeting. After months of failing to communicate with the team, and also playing for a Los Angeles-based summer league squad, the team handed out an indefinite suspension. But Cabagnot has since mended fences with the Realtors management and was able to play during the season.\n\nDuring the 2006 PBA Draft, the Realtors selected Filipino-American Kelly Williams as its first overall pick in the draft. They also nabbed Mark Isip as 6th overall and Mark Magsumbol as 13th overall in the said draft.\n\nIn the Philippine Cup, Sta Lucia was able to pull off a surprising start in the conference, due to great performances by their young player such as Williams, Cabagnot and veterans Marlou Aquino, Dennis Espino, and Kenneth Duremdes. However, a late slump followed a one-game playoff loss to Purefoods that relegated the Realtors to the wildcard phase. Despite a 1–2 win-loss record, Sta. Lucia was able to gain a berth in a knockout game due to their superior record in both the classification and wildcard phase. The Realtors defeated the Air21 Express 121–118 to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since the 2003 Reinforced Conference. However, Sta Lucia lost 3–1 to Red Bull in the five-game series despite a Game 1 victory.\n\nAfter the tournament, Alfrancis Chua was relieved of his duties as head coach and was moved to a position as team consultant. He was replaced by assistant coach Boyet Fernandez.\n\nThe Realtors paraded Rock Winston as import for the 2006–2007 Fiesta Conference. Sta. Lucia then dealt Kenneth Duremdes, Alex Cabagnot, and Ricky Calimag to Coca-Cola for Denok Miranda, Manny Ramos, and a 2008 second round draft pick. Later in the tournament, they replaced Winston for Jamaal Williams. They went 2–6 with Williams and got booted out in the wild card phase of the tournament by the San Miguel Beermen.\n\nSta. Lucia ended the elimination round of the All-Filipino Cup with 8 straight wins to get one of the two outright semi-finals slots along with the Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants. In the semifinals that reached the maximum seven games, the Realtors relied on Kelly Williams and Ryan Reyes to barge into their first Philippine Cup finals berth by beating the Alaska Aces. They further shocked PBA aficionados by winning the championship series in seven games against the number one seed Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants to win the 2007–08 PBA Philippine Cup, the 2nd championship title of the franchise since entering the league in 1993. PCU stalwart Nelbert Omolon gunned for 40 points to beat the Air21 Express in their last elimination game. Sta. Lucia won the first automatic semifinal berth and cruised through the playoffs, beating Alaska in the semifinal. The real challenge from the young Realtors team came in the finals when they went 2–0 but lost two straight games. The series went down to the deciding Game 7, with Sta. Lucia winning the game and the series against Purefoods. Kelly Williams was named Conference MVP while Dennis Espino was the Finals MVP.\n\nThe Realtors underwent a major overhaul in their roster. Nurse Coach Boyet Fernandez retained only 6 players from the previous roster and went on to tap undiscovered talent on the rookie free agent pool. Fernandez decided to get deserving players who have not got the chance to play in the PBA. The Realtors got Ryan Reyes, a standout from the PBL, and John Paul Limpo, from Malolos, Bulacan in the draft. Sta. Lucia also obtained the services of Dennis Daa, Christian Coronel, and Philip Butel from the rookie free agent pool. The team also added former Green Archer Joseph Yeo.\n\nDue to insufficient funds, Sta. Lucia was forced to make alterations in their roster. They traded Dennis Miranda to San Miguel Beermen for a draft pick and Dennis Espino to Coca-Cola Tigers for Jason Misolas and two second-round draft picks. They signed free agents Josh Urbiztondo, Chris Pacana and Ardy Larong to fill in the slots. Coach Boyet Fernandez was said to be very unhappy of losing their two powerhouse players. On May 13, 2010, after a long trade speculations, Sta. Lucia finally traded Kelly Williams, Ryan Reyes and Charles Waters to Talk n' Text exchange for Nic Belasco, Ali Peek, Pong Escobal, and Ogie Menor and Yousif Aljamal via Barako Bull. Sta Lucia team owner Buddy Encarnado was very sad of releasing their two powerhouse players again. Because of struggling mid-season, the Coca-Cola Tigers acquired former No. 1 pick Paolo Mendoza exchange for rookie Chris Ross.\n\nOn June 2010, there were reports that Meralco expressed interest in joining the PBA and intends to buy either Sta. Lucia's or Barako Bull's franchise after both teams unloaded most of their major players. After Barako Bull informed the board that they intend to stay with the league for the 2010–11 season, Sta. Lucia filed a \"leave of absence\". On August 10, the PBA board finally approved the sale of the Sta. Lucia franchise to Meralco. It is also announced that Ryan Gregorio will be its head coach.\n\nSta. Lucia had a policy of fielding all pure-Filipino lineup, which meant for the team to acquire only those players who have no foreign blood. This was criticized by many PBA fans because of Sta. Lucia's reluctance to improve their team. Some blamed center Marlou Aquino for this implementation. Aquino is a staunch opponent against fake Fil-foreign players that have invaded the PBA since the arrival of Asi Taulava, Eric Menk and others in 1999, in which he had appeared in several Senate committee hearings in the past.\n\nAnother conflict is the case of Alex Cabagnot. Cabagnot is considered by many as a Filipino-American after spending his high school and collegiate studies in the United States. However, the PBA listed him as a local player since he was born in the Philippines to Filipino parents. He was the Sta. Lucia Realtors' second overall pick in the 2005 PBA Draft.\n\nThis policy was later scrapped after the team drafted Filipino-American Kelly Williams in the 2006 PBA Draft.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Warner Bros. motion picture was based on a novel by Stephen Longstreet.\n\nSisters Fiona, Evelyn, and Susie Gaylord, are orphaned when first their mother goes down with the \"Lusitania\" and then their wealthy father, Major Penn Gaylord, is killed in France in World War I. Before Penn left for France, he told Fiona, the eldest, that the Gaylords have never sold the land they have acquired.\n\nHowever, their half billion dollar inheritance is held up in probate for decades; Fiona complains that they have practically grown up in court. Though they have a New York City Fifth Avenue mansion, the sisters have had to borrow money to live. A French charity claims that Penn made a later will before he died, leaving 10% of the Gaylord estate to it. Though the Gaylords are now willing to give up the 10%, their real antagonist, Charles Barclay, who wants their mansion, and the choice land on which it sits too, so he can tear it down as part of his real estate development, Barclay Square. Fiona is determined not to give in to this.\n\nMeanwhile, Evelyn has married an English nobleman, now fighting in the RAF, while Susie is in love with painter Gig Young, despite being married herself. Susanna only stayed with her husband for a few hours, but he refuses to grant her an annulment unless she pays him a great deal of money, to which of course she does not have access. When Evelyn returns home from England, she becomes attracted to Gig herself and tries to steal him away.\n\nIn 1941, Fiona fires the longtime Gaylord lawyer, Hershell Gibbon, when he appears to be too sympathetic to Charles. She hires Ralph Pedloch as his replacement. It is revealed that Fiona and Charles have a prior history together. Six years before, a relative died and left the sisters $100,000 on condition that Fiona be married. Fiona decided to go through with a sham marriage to a cousin, but ran into Charles, then a construction crew foreman, and found him much more attractive. Within a few days, she manipulated the lovestruck man into proposing. On their wedding night, she pretended to faint. While he went to purchase some medicine, she packed up, leaving a letter with $25,000, her wedding ring and an explanation. However, he returned before she left and forced her to have sex before letting her go. Fiona gave birth to a boy, Austin, and had him raised by a trusted friend. When that friend died, Fiona brought the now six-year-old to live with her. Unexpectedly, she finds herself becoming very fond of the child.\n\nWhen Susie tries to commit suicide after it appears that she has lost Gig, Fiona finally realizes the toll her stubborn determination has exacted on her family. She gives up the mansion and grants Charles sole custody of Austin. In the end, Gig chooses the now-single Susie, and Charles tells Fiona he still loves her. Fiona embraces and kisses him.\n\n\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,728,000 domestically and $857,000 foreign.\n"}

Players are automatically inducted if they reach career totals of 2,000 hits, 200 wins, or 250 saves (added in December 2003) in the Japanese professional leagues. \n\nInductees are awarded a special jacket, and participate in various baseball-related events during the off-season. Meikyukai members mostly makes appearances in charity and volunteer events, and holds annual meetings and a golf tournament, which is often broadcast on television. All of the money raised from the golf tournament is donated to the Red Cross.\n\nKaneda founded Meikyukai on July 24, 1978. In addition to Kaneda, the founding members of the club were Kazuhisa Inao, Masaaki Koyama, Keishi Suzuki, Tetsuya Yoneda, Shinichi Etoh, Sadaharu Oh, Morimichi Takagi, Masahiro Doi, Shigeo Nagashima, Katsuya Nomura, Isao Harimoto, Yoshinori Hirose, Kazuhiro Yamauchi, Takao Kajimoto, Mutsuo Minagawa and Minoru Murayama.\n\nHiromitsu Ochiai reached 2,000 hits in 1995, but declined membership because Kaneda and other members had repeatedly criticized him during his career.\n\nFirst baseman Kihachi Enomoto (with 2,314 career hits) didn't decline membership, but never participated in any of the club's meetings or events, and was not recognized as a member. (He died in 2012.)\n\nIn 2008, founder Masaichi Kaneda passed on club leadership to home run champion Sadaharu Oh after running it for more than 30 years.\n\nThe most recent inductee is Takashi Toritani, who got his 2000th career hit on 8 September 2017.\n\nThe founding members of the club limited membership to players born after 1926, partly because they only wanted members that had begun their career after the two-league system of Japanese baseball was established in 1950 (when the Japanese Baseball League reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball), but mostly because Kaneda did not want to include qualified members, such as Tetsuharu Kawakami, that were older than he was. According to current regulations, only players born between 1926 and 1988 can join, but the rules will probably be changed for younger players to be inducted in the near future.\n\nRecords in Major League Baseball (MLB) are also valid in counting the numbers; However, Meikyukai only takes records from the point where the player started his NPB career (i.e.: records before debut in NPB don't count). For example, Alex Ramírez's 86 hits in MLB before his NPB career were excluded and he was not inducted until he recorded his 2,000th NPB hit on April 6, 2013.\n\nThough other records such as home runs, stolen bases, and strikeouts are not officially included in the qualifications, Yutaka Fukumoto was specially inducted when he reached 800 career stolen bases (he would later mark 2,000 career hits).\n\nNationality is not officially regarded as a qualification, but since MLB records before starting a NPB career do not count, only one non-Japanese player (Alex Ramírez) so far has met the milestone.\n\n\n\n"}

He survives the sentence, but he has not disclosed the whereabouts of his vast treasure. The Royal Navy hatches a plot to increase his sentence by 140 years, knowing that he will escape to set out for his treasure. He does so, recruiting a motley crew of companions. He had left a map of the treasure in the chimney of his wife's pub, but she burned it and had the map tattooed on their son's head. Things go wrong when his traitorous former bosun Mr. Moon (Peter Boyle) takes over the ship. With the Head of the British Secret Service (Eric Idle) hot on their trail, they eventually find the island, where the terrible despot \"El Nebuloso\" (Tommy Chong) and his majordomo \"El Segundo\" (Cheech Marin) have taken residence with the treasure, and the battle for the prize commences.\n\nPeter Cook remembered \"It all started when Keith Moon, Sam Peckinpah, Graham Chapman and myself were dining at Trader Vic's. Keith suggested doing a movie about pirates and we were all discussing it and being enthusiastic, when I saw Sam, who was too tired to actually go to the lavatory, relieving himself in the artificial palm tree by the table. It was then that I thought the whole thing was rather unlikely to get off the ground.\"\n\nThe original concept for the film was funded by Chapman's close friend Moon, who wanted to play the lead role, but was dropped early on because of his deteriorating health.\n\nThe film has a complicated development history, largely due to the amount of time taken to get funding. There are at least four versions of the script drafts. The one that is \"truest to Chapman and McKenna's original version\" is published in the book \"Yellowbeard: High Jinks on the High Seas\". Major differences between Chapman and McKenna's script, and that altered at Hollywood's request, are that the original has less emphasis on minor characters, and more emphasis on the overall plot. Cook is credited as a writer because in October 1980, Chapman asked Cook to help with one of the rewrites.\n\nAmong the bewildering number of changes was the change of the romantic lead from Adam Ant to Sting to Martin Hewitt. Adam Ant was frustrated with production delays and quit. Sting wanted to play the role, but the Hollywood producers thought the film was becoming too British. Hewitt is quoted as saying that \"Sting should have had my part. For crying out loud, I would have hired Sting over me any day.\"\n\nChapman's friend Harry Nilsson created a preliminary soundtrack, including one song specifically for the film. This was not used because the producers felt he could not be relied on to finish it.\n\nThree ships in the film were portrayed by Bounty II, built by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the 1962 version of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". The pirate ship was named \"Edith\", after Chapman's mother.\n\nMarty Feldman died of a heart attack while filming in Mexico City in December 1982. His work on the film was nearly finished except for the scene of his character's death, filmed a few days later using a stunt double. Chapman said about Feldman's death: \"I try to look at the positive side...I take pleasure knowing that Marty was back on form for his last role.\"\n\nChapman was not allowed to assist with the editing, and his comments on the first cut were ignored; these included shortening the credits, so that audience expectation was not too far raised, and making the jokes less obvious.\n\nThe film received some praise, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" writing that \"There are many moments of hilarity here\". But it was not a big box-office success, and received mostly negative reviews. Various reasons are suggested, such as the peculiar combination of British and American humour, and it being poorly timed given the movie climate, with other kinds of comedy being popular. \"DVD Verdict\" gives it 75 out of 100, but writes \"It is, at times, hilarious, and contains all of the pieces of a great comedy. These pieces never come together to make a great film.\" Roger Ebert gave the film one-and-a-half stars, and said \"\"Yellowbeard\" is soon over and soon forgotten.\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 22% approval rating based on reviews from 9 critics.\n\nCleese played a part out of loyalty to Chapman. He said he found the script to be one of the worst he had read, although it is unclear which version he was referring to. In an interview given in 2001, Cleese described \"Yellowbeard\" as \"one of the six worst films made in the history of the world\".\n\nEric Idle mentioned \"Yellowbeard\" as one of the worst films he has ever made, but said he enjoyed making it. \"Sometimes, the best times can be on the worst movies and vice versa, e.g. \"Yellowbeard\", which I wouldn't have missed for the world.\"\n\nDuring the production of \"Yellowbeard\", Michael Mileham and Phil Schuman produced and directed a 45-minute behind-the-scenes documentary for Orion Pictures, entitled \"Group Madness: The Making of Yellowbeard\". Mileham said he wanted to make the documentary because \"Yellowbeard\" had \"more comics in it than any film since [1963's] \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\"\". Mileham and his crew followed the \"Yellowbeard\" filmmakers and cast to locations in England and Mexico, documenting their off-screen antics and interviewing many cast members, including Chapman, Idle, Cleese, Feldman, Boyle, Cook and Kahn.\n\nNear the time of the 1983 release of \"Yellowbeard\", \"Group Madness\" was syndicated to 75 television stations in the United States and broadcast only once on NBC on 11 June 1983, pre-empting \"Saturday Night Live\". In the mid-90s, video copies of the documentary could be ordered from Mileham; it was eventually released on DVD in 2007 and later streamed on Amazon.com.\n\n"}

They lost in the playoffs to eventual league champion Los Angeles Aztecs. When Eusebio came to Boston in 1975 (by which time the team had relocated to Nickerson Field) it seemed as though things would continue to look up.

In the playoffs the Minutemen lost to Miami in extra time.\n\nFor the 1976 season, team owner John Sterge announced the Minutemen would relocate again, this time to Harvard Stadium, but that deal collapsed before the start of the season and the team ended up playing in a hodge-podge of grounds: Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough, Veteran's Memorial Stadium in Quincy, and Sargent Field in New Bedford.\nBy this time Sterge was having financial difficulties (which ended in action by the Securities and Exchange Commission) and was compelled to sell off many of his players, including Eusebio, who went to the eventual champions Toronto Metros-Croatia.

He graduated in Economics from Queen Mary College, University of London. From 1986 to 2007, he owned the \"Daily Sport\" and \"Sunday Sport\" which he sold for £40 million.\n\nAccording to The \"Sunday Times Rich List\" in 2019, Sullivan is worth £1.15 billion.\n\nHe is the Joint-Chairman and largest single shareholder of Premier League football team West Ham United F.C. He was previously Joint-Chairman of Birmingham City F.C.\n\nBorn in Cardiff, the son of an RAF serviceman, Sullivan grew up living in a Penarth council house. When Sullivan was 10 years old his father was posted to Aden, Yemen where they lived for a year before moving to England to live in Hornchurch, Essex. He attended the Abbs Cross school and gained ten O Levels. After his family moved to Hertfordshire he attended Watford Grammar School for Boys obtaining three A levels. He read Economics at Queen Mary College, narrowly missing a first.\n\nWith his business partner, David Gold, Sullivan's first venture was selling soft pornography photos. They expanded into sex shops, adult magazines and several low-budget blue movies, making Sullivan a millionaire by the age of 25. By the late 1970s, he was in control of half of the UK adult magazine market, including major titles such as \"Playbirds\" and \"Whitehouse\", 80% of the adult mail order market, and 150 shops.\n\nIn the late 1970s, he produced several low-budget British sex movies including \"Come Play with Me\" (1977) (directed by Harrison Marks). This was followed by \"The Playbirds\" (1978), \"Confessions from the David Galaxy Affair\" (1979) and \"Queen of the Blues\" (1979), all starring his then-girlfriend Mary Millington. After Millington's suicide in August 1979 he continued with \"Mary Millington's True Blue Confessions\" (1980) and \"Emmanuelle in Soho\" (1981).\n\nIn 1982, Sullivan was convicted of living off immoral earnings of prostitutes. He successful appealed and was released after serving 71 days in prison. Sullivan explained that he did not feel embarrassed about the initial source of his early fortunes. \"I've made a lot of people happy,\" he said. \"If I was an arms manufacturer or a cigarette manufacturer, and my products killed millions of my clients, I'd have a bit of doubt about the whole thing. I was a freedom fighter. I believe in the right of adults to make their own decisions.\"\n\nSullivan operates an investment company, Conegate, which owns property in London including Russell & Bromley's flagship shopbuildings in Oxford Street near to Bond Street tube station.\n\nIn 1993, Sullivan bought into Birmingham City, with David Gold and Ralph Gold. The landmark deal saw the new owners secure an 80% stake of the Midlands outfit.\n\nIn 2007, Sullivan expressed his first desire to sell his share in Birmingham City and openly admitted three reasons for a possible departure. \"One, the geographical distance. I've said for years the journey to Birmingham is killing me. Two, I think deep down the public have had enough of us. They think we should have mortgaged our houses to buy more players to compete with Chelsea and Arsenal. The honeymoon is long over and we're at the divorce stage now, unfortunately. And I also feel we've had no support from Birmingham Council.\"\n\nAfter 16 years at the club, Birmingham managing director Karren Brady and chairman David Sullivan agreed to step down from their posts on completion of Carson Yeung's takeover in Autumn 2009.\n\nThen manager Alex McLeish was quick to praise the Sullivan-Gold duo in the press for providing the club with financial stability, admitting he had a huge amount of respect for them and what they had achieved.\n\nOn Sullivan's departure from Birmingham he expressed his intentions to remain in football. Less than one year on in January 2010 he and David Gold acquired a 50% share in West Ham United giving them operational and commercial control and valuing the Premier League club at £105 million. Karren Brady, who had also played a significant role in turning around City's fortunes, joined the Hammers as vice-chairman.\n\nOn the day the takeover was confirmed, an emotional Sullivan said: \"It's going to take time to sink in. We've been wanting to sit here for 20 years and together we owned 27 per cent of the club 22 years ago and it's taken us 22 years to get to where want to be.\nBoth me and David are supporters, I went to university here and I lived in Hornchurch. David lived 50 yards from the ground for 20 years of his life and played for West Ham's youth team. We just want to be here where we've always wanted to be. There is no other club we would want to be at so for us we have come home and that's what it's all about.\"\n\nWithin five months the Sullivan and Gold duo pledged a further commitment to the club and on 25 May 2010 they increased their stake to 60% (Sullivan with 30%). Vice-chairman Karren Brady later explained the move gave the football club \"the much-needed stability.\"\nIn September 2012 Sullivan revealed that together with Gold they were personally funding the club's transfer business because the 'cupboard was left bare' by its former Icelandic owners. He told the Daily Mail that 'as a business venture, buying West Ham made no sense at all.' He said, 'Not the deal we did. The club was £120 million in debt with very few assets. It was a mess. But David [Gold] and I are not in it for the money. We want to put the best possible team on the pitch for the supporters of West Ham because we are supporters too.'\n\nAs part of his long-term aspirations for the club Sullivan backed West Ham's bid to move into the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal, with the stadium planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–2017 season. In July 2013 Sullivan became the largest single shareholder of West Ham United acquiring a further 25% of shares in the club. In March 2018, there were protests against Sullivan at the London Stadium during a 3–0 home defeat to Burnley. There were four pitch invasions and Sullivan was escorted from his seat before the end of the match. Sullivan was also hit by a coin thrown by one of the supporters.\n\nOn 26 March 2018 an HMRC tax tribunal ruled that Sullivan had used West Ham United to avoid paying £700,000 tax for his own family business, Conegate Ltd. Sullivan used Conegate to buy £2m of shares in the holding company that owns West Ham. The same day the shares were converted to \"deferred shares\", deemed practically worthless and sold back for £1 back to the holding company. Conegate thereby used the £2m loss to reduce its tax bill.\n\nSullivan lives in Birch Hall, near Theydon Bois, Essex. It was built by Ashby and Horner to Sullivan's design in 1992 and set in around 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land, at a cost of £7.5m for the land and building. This is in addition to a commercial property empire worth an estimated £500m. His girlfriend is Emma Benton-Hughes, the sister of Jonny Trunk. The couple have two children, David and Jack. Jack Sullivan frequently provides updates on West Ham's transfer dealing via Twitter with his tweets being used by the press for information on possible transfers. In 2013, he apologised after tweeting \"\"I am very sorry about this news Chamakh has sign a 6-month loan deal! not my pick\"\" relating to the loan signing of Marouane Chamakh from Arsenal. In June 2015, Jack Sullivan was given his own news column on West Ham's website, www.whufc.com. In May 2017, Jack Sullivan was appointed as managing director of West Ham United Women.\n\nSullivan is a philanthropist and has been a patron of Prostate Cancer UK for over 15 years. He is also an active supporter of the Teenage Cancer Trust along with several other charities nationwide. Sullivan celebrated West Ham's promotion to the Premier League in May 2012 by donating a five figure sum to a charity for children with autism.\n\n\n\n"}

It was remastered by Lee Herschberg.\n\nThe album is sometimes referred to as Randy Newman Creates Something New Under The Sun, which was written on the reverse of the album sleeve. In 2017, \"Randy Newman\" was ranked the 97th greatest album of the 1960s by \"Pitchfork\".\n\nNewman later commented on the lack of influence from rock and roll on the album. \n\n\"It's like I'd never heard The Rolling Stones. I thought you could move things along just with the orchestra, that it was somehow cheating to use drums. What Van Dyke and I, and Harry Nilsson to some degree, were doing, it was like a branch of homo sapiens that didn't become homo sapiens. Homo erectus,\" he said.\n\nNewman said in 2017, that he signed away the publishing rights on his first album, doesn't see any money from people doing covers of those songs and advised people getting into the business to never sign away their publishing.\n\nAs with many of Newman's early albums, several Newman-penned songs had been previously recorded by other artists.\n\n\n\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\" b/w \"The Beehive State\" was issued as a single on Reprise 0284. Reprise also issued this single on a promotional 10\" vinyl 78 rpm record as the first (and only) release under their proposed \"Reprise Speed Series\" of 78 RPM releases (the series was discontinued by Reprise due to a lack of interest and sales a few months after this release).\n\nRolling Stone noted, \"the mood of a bitter longing for affection that characterizes the album. \n\nDenny Cordell has called Randy “the foremost practitioner of suburban blues,” and certainly “Love Story” is the blues of Middle America. The song marks out a simple pattern of life: boy meets girl, gets married, lives in suburbia, has children, dies. Randy moves in on The Dream in an uncommon way: “When our kids are grown/They’ll send us away to a little home in Florida/ We’ll play checkers all day/Till we pass away.”\"\n\nCritic Ellen Willis feels that the songs on the album, \"show an intimate familiarity with, and an affection for, all the nuances of American life - the setting and characters, the family relationships, the romantic fantasies, the euphemisms - as well as an unsparing awareness of our oppression of old people, fat people, and other nonmainstream types.\"\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann in an AllMusic retrospective review feels that Newman's lyrics are \"intent upon taking clichés and using them to satirize social conventions, a popular parlor game in the late '60s.\" Overall he considers the album \"an audacious first album by a major, if extremely quirky, talent.\"\n\nIn 2000 it was voted number 716 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". \n\nAll songs written and arranged by Randy Newman.\n\n\n"}

Their home field was Mile High Stadium. The arrival of the Caribous marked the return of professional first division soccer to Denver after a two-year absence caused by the departure of the Denver Dynamos to Minneapolis in 1976.

{"id": "1954241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954241", "title": "Automotive design", "text": "Automotive design\n\nAutomotive design is the process of developing the appearance, and to some extent the ergonomics, of motor vehicles, including automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, buses, coaches, and vans.\n\nThe functional design and development of a modern motor vehicle is typically done by a large team from many different disciplines included within automotive engineering, however, design roles are not associated with requirements for Professional or Chartered-Engineer qualifications. Automotive design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept. Automotive design as a professional vocation is practiced by designers who may have an art background and a degree in industrial design or transportation design.\nTerminology used in the field is found in the glossary of automotive design.\n\nThe task of the design team is usually split into three main aspects: exterior design, interior design, and color and trim design. Graphic design is also an aspect of automotive design; this is generally shared amongst the design team as the lead designer sees fit. Design focuses not only on the isolated outer shape of automobile parts, but concentrates on the combination of form and function, starting from the vehicle package.\n\nThe aesthetic value will need to correspond to ergonomic functionality and utility features as well. In particular, vehicular electronic components and parts will give more challenges to automotive designers who are required to update on the latest information and knowledge associated with emerging vehicular gadgetry, particularly dashtop mobile devices, like GPS navigation, satellite radio, HD radio, mobile TV, MP3 players, video playback, and smartphone interfaces. Though not all the new vehicular gadgets are to be designated as factory standard items, some of them may be integral to determining the future course of any specific vehicular models.\n\nThe design team(s) responsible for the exterior of the vehicle develops the proportions, shape, and surface details of the vehicle. Exterior design is first done by a series of manual sketches and digital drawings. Progressively, drawings that are more detailed are executed and approved by appropriate layers of management, followed by digital rendering to images. Consumer feedback is generally sought at this point to help iteratively refine vehicle concepts according to the targeted market, and will continue throughout the rest of the design refinement process. After more progressive refinement, industrial plasticine and or digital models are developed from and along with the drawings and images. The data from these models are then used to create quarter-scale and finally full-sized mock-ups of the final design. With three- and five-axis CNC milling machines, the clay model is first designed in a computer program and then \"carved\" using the machine and large amounts of clay. Even in times of high-class 3D (three dimensional) software and virtual models on power walls, the clay model is still the most important tool for final evaluation of the exterior design of a vehicle and, therefore, is used throughout the industry.\n\nThe designer responsible for the vehicles' interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for the instrument panel, seats, door trim panels, headliner, pillar trims, etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).\n\nThe color and trim (or color and materials) designer is responsible for the research, design, and development of all interior and exterior colors and materials used on a vehicle. These include paints, plastics, fabric designs, leather, grains, carpet, headliner, wood trim, and so on. Color, contrast, texture, and pattern must be carefully combined to give the vehicle a unique interior environment experience. Designers work closely with the exterior and interior designers.\n\nDesigners draw inspiration from other design disciplines such as: industrial design, fashion, home furnishing, architecture, and sometimes product design. Specific research is done into global trends to design for projects two to three model years in the future. Trend boards are created from this research in order to keep track of design influences as they relate to the automotive industry. The designer then uses this information to develop themes and concepts that are then further refined and tested on the vehicle models.\n\nThe design team also develops graphics for items such as: badges, decals, dials, switches, kick or tread strips, liveries.\n\nThe sketches and rendering are transformed into 3D Digital surface modelling and rendering for real-time evaluation with Math data in initial stages. During the development process succeeding phases will require the 3D model fully developed to meet the aesthetic requirements of a designer and well as all engineering and manufacturing requirements.\nThe fully developed CAS digital model will be re-developed for manufacturing meeting the Class-A surface standards that involves both technical as well as aesthetics. This data will be further developed by Product Engineering team. These modelers usually have a background in Industrial design or sometimes tooling engineering in case of some Class-A modelers. Autodesk Alias and ICEM Surf are the two most widely used software tools for Class-A development.\n\nSeveral manufacturers have slightly varied development cycles for designing an Automobile, but in practice these are the following.\nThe design process occurs concurrently with other product Engineers who will be engineering the styling data for meeting performance, manufacturing and safety regulations. From mid-phase, back and forth interactions between the designers and product engineers culminates into a finished product be manufacturing ready.\n\nApart from this the Engineering team parallelly works in the following areas. Product Engineering (Body In White Sheetmetal Design and Plastic engineering), NVH Development team, Prototype development, Powertrain engineering, Physical Vehicle validation, Tool and Die development and Manufacturing process design.\n\nThe Design team for a specific model consists of a chief designer and an Exterior as well as interior designer. In some cases all three roles are done by one designer. Several junior designers are involved in the development process as well who make specific contributions all overseen by the chief designer. Apart from this the Color and trim designer works closely with other designers. The Clay model team and Digital model team works closely with the styling team all located within the studio. \nApart from this there would be studio head, studio managers and prototype engineers who would work across all teams in the studio.\nThe total team size for developing a full sedan usually ranges from 25 to 40 members and the development time lasts for more than 24 months till signed-off for tooling and production. Thereafter a smaller team would be working until vehicle launch.\n\nIntegration of an automobile involves fitting together separate parts to form a monocoque body or units and mounting these onto a frame, the chassis.\n\nAn automobile chassis basically comprises the following:\n\nThe chassis is complete in itself as a road vehicle. It can drive and control itself just as in case of a complete car and therefore, in many motor works, the chassis is usually tested on the road before the complete body of the vehicle is attached as the chassis alone can behave as the propulsion means.\n\nIn the United States, automotive design reached a turning point in the 1920s when the American national automobile market began reaching saturation. To maintain unit sales, General Motors head Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners that they needed to buy a new replacement each year, an idea borrowed from the bicycle industry (though Sloan usually gets the credit, or blame). Critics called his strategy planned obsolescence. Sloan preferred the term \"dynamic obsolescence\". This strategy had far-reaching effects on the auto business, the field of product design, and eventually the American economy.\n\nThe smaller automakers could not maintain the pace and expense of yearly re-styling. Henry Ford did not like the model-year change because he clung to an engineer's notions of simplicity, economics of scale, and design integrity. GM surpassed Ford's sales in 1931, and became the dominant company in the industry thereafter. The frequent design changes also made it necessary to use a body-on-frame rather than the lighter but less adaptable monocoque design used by most European automakers.\nSome U.S. designers include Gordon Buehrig, who was responsible for the Auburn 851, as well as the Cord 810 and 812 (hence also the Hupmobile Skylark and the Graham Hollywood).\n\nIn the 1930s, Chrysler's innovations with aerodynamics helped launch the Chrysler Airflow in 1934, which was revolutionary and radical compared to the contemporary vehicles. However, inadequate consumer acceptance of the advanced appearance of the cars forced a re-design of succeeding models of the Airflow. This marketing experience made the entire industry take note of the high risks involved in incorporating major design advancements into their production cars.\n\nA major influence on American auto styling and marketing was Harley Earl, who brought the tailfin and other aeronautical design references to auto design starting with the rear fenders of the 1948 Cadillac. Another notable designer was Chrysler group's designer Virgil Exner, who developed the Forward look design in the mid-1950s. Exner is also credited with using wind tunnel testing to justify incorporating tailfins, thus moving the company away from boxy-looking cars into more aerodynamic and futuristic designs. Raymond Loewy was responsible for a number of Studebaker vehicles, such as the Starlight (including the bullet-nose).\n\nStarting in the 1960s, Richard A. Teague, who spent most of his career with American Motors Corporation (AMC), originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings, starting with the AMC Cavalier. Teague was responsible for unique automotive designs such as the two-seat AMC AMX muscle car, the subcompact Gremlin, the Pacer, and Matador coupe, as well as the original and market segment-creating, Jeep Cherokee (introduced in 1983, and built to 2001 in the U.S. and through 2005 in China).\n\nAdditionally during the 1960s, Ford's first generation Ford Mustang and Thunderbird marked another era leading into new market segments from Detroit. The Ford Mustang achieved record sales in its first year of production and established the pony car segment.\n\nPersonal injury litigation has had an effect on the design and appearance of the car in the 20th century.\n\nUntil World War I, most of the automakers were concerned with mechanical reliability rather than its external appearance. Later, luxury and aesthetics became a demand and also an effective marketing tool. Designs from each nation with its own strong cultural identity, reflected in their exterior and interior designs. World War II slowed the progress, but after the early-1950s, Italian designers set the trend and remained the driving force until the early part of the 1980s.\n\nIn France notable designs came from Bugatti and Avions Voisin. Of the mass selling cars Citroën, launched their vehicles with innovative designs and engineering and mostly aided by the styling of Flaminio Bertoni as evident from Citroën DS. After World War II, with the disappearance of the coach building industry, French automakers (except Citroën) followed British and other popular trends until they gained financial stability. During the 1980s, manufactures like Renault cultivated their own strong design identities with designers like Patrick Le Quement. Peugeot, which was dependent on Pininfarina since early post-war period, later established its own brand identity from the 1980s onwards. Its other company, Citroën, still retains its distinctive French innovations for its designs.\n\nGreat Britain was Europe's leading manufacturer of automobiles until the late-1960s. During that era there were more British-based automakers than in the rest of Europe combined. The British automobile industry catered to all segments ranging from compact, budget, sports, utility, and luxury-type cars. Car design in Britain was markedly different from other European designs largely because British designers were not influenced by other European art or design movements, as well as the British clay modelers used a different sweep set.\n\nBritish cars until World War II were sold in most of the British colonies. Innovations in vehicle packaging and chassis engineering combined with global familiarity with British designs meant vehicles were acceptable to public tastes at that time. British skilled resources like panel beaters, die machinists, and clay modelers were also available also partly due their involvement with motorsport industry.\n\nStill during the 1960s, British manufacturers sought professional help from the Italians, such as Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, and Pininfarina. Notable British contributions to automobile designs were Morris Mini by Alec Issigonis, several Jaguar Cars by Sir William Lyons and Malcolm Sayer, Aston Martin DB Series, and several cars from Triumph and MG. Ford Europe based in Great Britain, is notable for the Ford Sierra line, a creation of Uwe Bahnsen, Robert Lutz, and Patrick le Quément. Other British designers were William Towns for Aston Martin cars and David Bache for Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles.\n\nGermany is often considered the birthplace of industrial design with Bauhaus School of Design. However, the Nazi regime closed down the design school. Ferdinand Porsche and his family played a significant role in German design. Mercedes Benz passenger cars were also in luxury segment and played more importance to aesthetics. After the 1980s, German design evolved into a distinctive Teutonic style often to complement their high engineered cars suited to Autobahns. The early German design clues of present-day owes some part to Italian designers like Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, and Giorgetto Giugiaro. During the mid- and late-20th century one of the most influential coach builder/designer in Germany was Karmann.\n\nGerman designs started gaining popularity after the 1980s, notable after the formation of Audi. Volkswagen, which was dependent on Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Karmann, later formed the contemporary design language along with Audi. BMW entered the automobile design with a sporty-looking everyday sedans using Giovanni Michelotti. These models were later enhanced by Ercole Spada into the 1980s, and Klaus Luthe until the mid-1990s. The American-born designer Chris Bangle was hired by BMW in the late-1990s to re-define the brand. Bangle incorporated new single press technology for compound curves to add controversial styling elements to his designs.\n\nThe Porsche family contribution were instrumental in the evolution of Porsche cars, while the Italian designer Bruno Sacco helped create various Mercedes Models from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nIn Italy, companies like Fiat and Alfa Romeo played a major role in car design. Many coach builders were dependent on these two major manufacturers. Italian manufacturers had a large presence in motorsports leading to several sport car manufacturers like Ferrari, Lancia, Lamborghini, Maserati, etc. During the late-1950s, Italian automobile designs gained global popularity coinciding with the modern fashion and architecture at that time around the world. Various design and technical schools in Turin turned out designers in large scale. By the late-1960s almost all Italian coach builders transformed into design studios catering to automakers around the world. The trend continued in the 1990s, when the Japanese and Korean manufacturers sourced designs from these styling studios. One example is Pininfarina.\n\nItalian designers whose designs services were sought globally are Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Walter de Silva.\n\nSweden had Volvo and Saab as domestic automakers, and the nation's northern location required that cars needed to withstand Nordic climate conditions. The Scandinavian design elements are known for their minimalism and simplicity. One of the early original Scandinavian designs was the Saab 92001 by Sixten Sason and Gunnar Ljungström.\n\nPrior to World War II and until the early-1990s, Czechoslovakia had strong presence in the automotive industry with manufacturers like Skoda, Jawa, Tatra, CZ, Praga, and Zetor. Czech automobiles were generally known for their originality in mechanical simplicity and designs were remarkably Bohemian as evident from Tatra cars and Jawa motorcycles. During the Communist regime, design started falling back and ultimately the domestic automakers ended up as subsidiaries of EU-based companies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954244", "title": "Marcel Granet", "text": "Marcel Granet\n\nMarcel Granet (29 February 1884 – 25 November 1940) was a French sociologist, ethnologist and sinologist. As a follower of Émile Durkheim and Édouard Chavannes, Granet was one of the first to bring sociological methods to the study of China. Granet was revered in his own time as a sociological sinologist, or sinological sociologist, and member of the Durkheimian school of sociology.\n\nGranet was born in Luc-en-Diois (Drôme), France. His father was an engineer, and his grandfather, a landowner. He attended lycée at Aix-en-Provence and then at the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, which traditionally attracted bright students striving to gain entrance to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.\nGranet passed the \"baccalauréat\" examination and entered the École Normale in 1904, just as the tumultuous Dreyfus Affair was coming to a close and the French educational system was changing. The École Normale was reunited with the University of Paris at the Sorbonne in 1903, and the former's students, called \"normaliens\", took classes at the Sorbonne with University students. Émile Durkheim, the sociologist and founder of \"Année Sociologique\" in 1898, who would greatly influence the life and work of Granet, began teaching a course on pedagogy at the Sorbonne—it was compulsory for all students from 1904 until 1913. Therefore, Granet first became introduced to Durkheim and his theories during his first year at the École.\nAt the École Normale, Granet embraced philosophy, law, and history, along with sociology, though his work in any field would adopt a Durkheimian character. He became part of an elite group of students which included future medieval historian and founder of the \"Annales school\" of history Marc Bloch, the geographer Philippe Arbos, sociologist Georges Davy, Hellenist and future librarian of the École Normale Paul Étard, mathematician Paul Lévy, and more. In 1905, Granet joined a socialist study group whose membership included Durkheimian sociologist, anthropologist, major contributor to the \"Année\" and nephew of Durkheim himself, Marcel Mauss; future ancient Greek specialist and editor of \"Année\" Louis Gernet; and future Durkheimian sociologist, philosopher and contributor to \"Année\", Maurice Halbwachs.\nAfter earning his \"agrégation\" in history in 1907, Granet was appointed to teach history at a \"lycée\" at Bastia, on the island of Corsica. In 1908, he received a grant through the Fondation Thiers to pursue research on feudalism. He apparently spoke to Lucien Herr—the librarian of the École Normale from 1888 to 1926 who was associated with Durkheim and his students, and who was active in the socialist movement and the Dreyfus Affair—who advised Granet, when the latter thought of considering the Japanese case, to seek the advice of respected sinologist Edouard Chavannes, then apparently the nearest Granet could get in Paris to an expert on Japan. Chavannes in turn counseled Granet to begin with Chinese as the necessary first step towards Japanese studies, warning him that he would get entangled in Chinese, never to reach Japanese.\nGranet spent three years at Thiers, working alongside fellow pensioners Bloch and Louis Gernet, both former \"normaliens\". Granet's own work on feudalism, often framed in Durkheimian sociological theory, apparently influenced and oriented the work of Bloch and Gernet, in particular Bloch's interest in rites and myths.\nIn 1911, Granet published his first work, a socialist pamphlet titled “Contre l’alcoolisme, un programme socialiste,” and that same year, left the Fondation Thiers upon receiving a grant from the French government to study classical Chinese texts in China. Interest in the country was high at the time. In Beijing (then known in anglophone countries as \"Peking\"), he met the Frenchman who possessed great knowledge of Chinese and Chinese scholars. In 1912 Granet sent Chavannes a paper, “Coutumes matrimoniales de la Chine antique” upon the latter's request, which Chavannes submitted for publication in the \"T’oung Pao\", a major sinological journal. In March of that year, Granet was caught in the middle of the Chinese revolution, as the Republic of China was replacing the Qing dynasty. Granet wrote to friends at home, “We pack up: the twenty-four historians, in their frail cases, decorated with green characters, make a shaky structure. The \"Année Sociologique\" is in my hand bag. I stuff my suitcases.” (Freedman)\nUpon returning from China in 1913, Granet earned a teaching position in the history department at the Lycée de Marseille in March, and in October, at the Lycée de Montpellier. In December, he replaced Chavannes as Directeur d’Études pour les religions d’Extrême-Orient at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, after Chavannes resigned his post.\nLike most men of his era, and of his promotion, Granet served in World War I from 1914–1918, earning the Croix de Guerre. He stayed briefly in Beijing in 1918 while on a mission there. Throughout the war he continued his studies of China and worked on two doctoral theses.\nIn 1919, Granet returned to France and in June, married Marie Terrien, after which he resumed his academic life. In January 1920, he was examined for his doctorate, the jury for which included the British anthropologist Sir James Frazer. In 1922, upon a request from Maurice Solovine to write a short book for the series “science et civilization,” Granet composed \"La religion des Chinois\" (\"The Religion of the Chinese People\") in six weeks while traveling back and forth between Paris and Tonnerre (Yonne), where his wife taught at a \"lycée\" and cared for their infant son. In December 1922, Granet replaced Mauss, when the latter scalded his foot, as a member of the committee for Georges Davy's thesis, “The Swearing of Faith,” and subsequently published harsh criticism of it in the \"Journal de Psychologie Normale et Pathologie\".\nAcknowledging the decline of \"Année\" following Durkheim's death in 1917, several Durkheimians met in March 1923 in Paris to design a plan to resuscitate the journal. Also in attendance at the meeting were Henri Hubert, Henri and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, and Mauss. Granet was to work on the sections of religious sociology and legal sociology. In 1925, he was named professor of geography, history, and institutions of the Far East at the École Nationale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, and in 1926, helped to establish the Institut des Hautes Études Chinoises. From then on, he acted there as administrator and professor of Chinese and Chinese civilization.\nTwo years after his friend and colleague Mauss became president of the fifth section of religious science at l’École Pratique, Britain declared war on Germany, and in 1940, Granet replaced his friend upon the latter's resignation. Mauss, of Jewish heritage, sought to “safeguard the interests” of the school. (Fournier)\nOne month later, after the defeat of the French Republic, Granet died at Sceaux, outside Paris, at the age of 56. Mauss had considered Granet “one of [his] best and most beloved friends.” (Fournier)\nAs a teacher, Granet, “a bristling and cantankerous disputant, a rich mind powerfully stimulating those of others” (Gille) apparently instructed his students to “read slowly and always slowly.” According to one student, Polish sinologist Witold Jablonski, Granet did “not care for popularity”: \"He is a scholar, he is a thinker, sometimes, perhaps, a wizard.” (Jablonski) The sinologist shared his commitment to learning the language of the texts he studied, and analyzing all materials, whether primary or secondary, critically. He divided his teaching into the \"mythique\" and the \"juridique\" (the latter primarily consisting of rights and duties of kinship and marriage), though he did not necessarily succeed in eliciting in his students the same enthusiasm he possessed for both areas simultaneously. Among his students were also Korean-Japanese Itsuo Tsuda, who developed the \"école de la respiration\" and several future sinologists. Granet's work, meanwhile, brought Durkheimian sociology into the classical Chinese realm, from his analysis of the Book of Odes to a sociological study of Chinese numerology. Although he is remembered as a significant figure of both Durkheimian sociology and French sinology, his two roles are rarely recognized or thoroughly understood in tandem.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954257", "title": "Ubayd Zakani", "text": "Ubayd Zakani\n\nNizam al-Din Ubaydullah Zakani (), or simply Ubayd-i Zakani ( c. 1300 – 1371 CE), was a Persian poet and satirist of the 14th century from the city of Qazvin, Persia. He studied in Shiraz under the best masters of his day, but eventually moved back to his native town. He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin, as he was a court poet in Shiraz for \"Shah Abu Ishaq\", where a young Hafez was present as well.\n\nHis work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices. He wrote the \"Resaleh-ye Delgosha\", as well as \"Akhlaq al-Ashraf\" (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\") and the famous humorous fable \"Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh\" (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of Persian literature. He is one of the most remarkable poets, satirists and social critics of Iran, whose works have not received proper attention in the past. His books are translated into Russian, Danish, Italian, English, and German (by Joachim Wohlleben, 2009: seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language).\n\nWhile pursuing his studies in Shiraz Ubayd became one of the most accomplished men of letters and learning of his time, acquiring complete proficiency in every art, and compiling books and treatises on them. He subsequently returned to Qazvin, where he had the honour of being appointed to a judgeship and was chosen as the tutor and teacher of sundry young gentlemen. At that time the Turks in Persia had left no prohibited or vicious act undone, and the character of the Persian people, by reasons of association and intercourse with them, had become so changed and corrupted that Ubayd Zakani, disgusted at the contemplation thereof, sought by every means to make known and bring home to them the true conditions of affairs. Therefore, as an example of the corrupt morals of the age and its people, he composed the treatise known as \"Akhlaq-i Ashraf\" \"Ethics of the Aristocracy\", which was not intended as mere ribaldry, but as a satire containing serious reflections and wise warnings. So, likewise, in order to depict the level of intelligence and degree of knowledge of the leading men of Qazwin each one of whom was a mass of stupidity and ignorance, he included in his \"Risala-i Dilqusha\" \"Joyous Treatise\" many anecdotes of which each contains a lesson for persons of discernment.\n\nAs a measure of his accomplishments, experience, learning and worldly wisdom, his \"Risala-i-Sad\" \"Tract of a Hundred Counsels\" and his \"Ta'rifat\" \"Definitions\" are a sufficient proof. Moreover, he composed a treatise \"Ilm-i-Ma'ni u Bayan\" \"Rhetoric\" which he desired to present to the king. The courtiers and favorites, however, told him that the King had no need for such rubbish. Then he composed a fine panegyric, which he desired to recite, but they informed him that the king did not like to be mocked with the lies, exaggerations and fulsome flattery of poets. Thereupon 'Ubayd-i-Zakani said, 'In that case I, too, will pursue the path of impudence, so that by these means I may obtain access to the King's most intimate society, and may become one of his courtiers and favorites', which he accordingly did.\n\nThen he began recklessly to utter the most shameless sayings and the most unseemly and extravagant jests, whereby he obtained innumerable gifts and presents, which none dared to pose and contend with him. Thus 'Ubayd-i-Zakani a serious writer, a moralist and a panegyrist was compelled by circumstances to become a ribald satirist.\n\nThe most striking feature of the serious poems of 'Ubayd-i-Zakani is the constant references to Fars and its capital, Shiraz, which evidently held the affection of the poet far more than his native city of Qazvin.\n\nUbayd wrote religious poems, praise of God, Muhammad and the Rashidun caliphs; but he neither claimed nor desired to lead a virtuous life.\n\nPoverty and debt were the usual lots of 'Ubayd.\n\nAmong his works are the Masnavi of Mush o-gorbeh (Mouse and Cat), and \nTract of hundred counsels.(short sayings of Wisdom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) A guy got married. On their first night together, his wife started piercing her ears with a needle. When they had sex a bit later, he found she was not a virgin. He said: \"my lady, the hole you must have created while in your father's house, you're making here, and the one you should make here you've already made there\".\n\n2) A guy from Qazvin was screwing his wife in the summer heat. The woman kept farting every now and then. \"What are you doing?\" he protested. \"Blowing air at your balls so they don't overheat\", she responded.\n\n3) A good-looking Christian boy converted to Islam. The sheriff ordered his circumcision, on the first day, and raped him that very night. The next day his father asked him: \"how did you find Muslims?\" \"Strange peoples\", he responded. \"Whoever accepts their faith, they cut his dick in the day and tear his ass in the night.\" \n\n4) A guy went to a religious scholar and said: \"I get an erection whenever I pray. What should I do?\" The scholar said: \"think of your parents passing\". \"Doesn't work\", he responded. \"Your own last breath\", \"no use\". Whatever the scholar said didn't work. He finally got mad and said: \"so just come fuck me you ass\". The guy responded: \"your holiness's wish is my command\". \n\n5) A guy from Shiraz was making love to his wife. He noticed that she had not removed her pubic hair. He said: \"this is no problem between us as husband and wife, but make sure you're careful about these things with strangers as it would cause huge embarrassment\".\n\n6) A king had three wives: Persian, Arab and Coptic. One night, he was in bed with the Persian wife. \"What time is it?\" he asked. \"It must be dawn\", the wife responded. \"How do you know?\", \"The scent of fresh grass and flowers has risen and the birds are singing\", she responded. The next night he asked the Arab wife the same question. \"It must be dawn as the pearls of my necklace feel cool on my breasts\", she answered. On the third night, he asked the same question to the Coptic wife. \"It must be dawn as I really have to shit\", she said.\n"}

{"id": "1954268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954268", "title": "Dallas Tornado", "text": "Dallas Tornado\n\nThe Dallas Tornado was a soccer team based in Dallas that played in the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1967 to 1981. Of the twelve teams that comprised the US in 1967, the Tornado franchise played the longest–15 seasons.\n\nTheir home fields were Cotton Bowl (1967–1968), P.C. Cobb Stadium (1969), Franklin Field (1970–1971), Texas Stadium (1972–1975, 1980–1981) and Ownby Stadium on the SMU campus (1976–1979). The club played Indoor soccer at Reunion Arena for one season (1980–81), and hosted the two-day 1975 Regionals at Fair Park Coliseum.\n\nThe franchise was one of the original clubs that played in the United Soccer Association, one of the two precursors to the NASL, in 1967. That year overseas clubs played in U.S. cities as American teams. The team that played as the Dallas Tornado were Dundee United of the Scottish Football League.\n\nThe following season when the USA merged with the NPSL, owners Lamar Hunt and Bill McNutt had to build a new team from scratch. They hired Bob Kap, a Serbian born soccer coach who had escaped with his family during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Kap had studied with Ferenc Puskás at the Soccor Academy in Hungary. Kap was recruited from Toronto, Canada, where he had relocated after the 1956 Revolution.\nDuring the first 6 months as coach, Kap traveled throughout Europe to form the new Dallas Tornado, hiring young players from England to Turkey.\n\nThe fledgling Dallas Tornado learned to play as a team on their world tour during seven months in 1967–68, where they played 45 games in 26 countries spanning five continents. Their world tour took them from England to India, from Indonesia to Vietnam during the height of the war. The Tornado consisted 8 players from England, 5 from Norway, 2 each from Sweden and the Netherlands; there was only one American player, Jay Moore. The Tornado played in front of crowds of up to 50,000, and they played several well-established teams, such as a 2–2 draw against Fenerbahçe, as well as playing Spanish second-division side Real Oviedo, and the Japan national team. The tour gave the new Dallas Tornado team an international face at a time when American soccer was relatively unknown. The gallant effort resulted in a record of 10 wins, nine draws and 26 defeats\n\nFollowing the 1968 NASL season, the league was in trouble with ten franchises having folded. The 1969 season was split into two halves. The first half was called the International Cup, a double round robin tournament in which the remaining NASL clubs were represented by teams imported from the United Kingdom. The Tornado was represented again by Dundee United. The Tornado came in tied for third in the Cup with a 2–4–2 record. For the second half of the 1969 season, the teams returned to their normal rosters and played a 16-game schedule with no playoffs.\n\nFortunes improved for the club as they won the NASL championship in 1971, defeating the Atlanta Chiefs 2–0 in the final game of a three-game series, Mike Renshaw scoring the winning goal. The road to that title was marathon that, barring a rule change, might never be duplicated. In Game 1 of the best-of-three semifinal against the Rochester Lancers, league scoring champion Carlos Metidieri mercifully ended the match 2–1, late in the 6th 15 minute-overtime period in the 176th minute, less than four minutes shy of playing two complete games in one day. Three days later Dallas evened the series at one game each with a 3–1 regulation win. In the rubber match four days later, the two teams ended regulation tied again at 1 goal apiece. The game reached 4OTs before Bobby Moffat sent Dallas into the Finals in the 148 minute. Four days after that, Dallas lost Game 1 of the NASL Championship Series, 2–1 in the 3OTs to Atlanta after 123 minutes. All totaled, Dallas had played 537 minutes of football (3 minutes short of six games) in 13 days time. Finally the Tornado were able to get control of the series pulling away in games 2 and 3 by scores of 4–1 and 2–0 respectively.\n\nSeveral division titles followed in the years after that league title. The face of the team was Kyle Rote, Jr., son of former New York Giants wide receiver and TV broadcaster Kyle Rote. In 1973, Rote Jr. led the league in scoring and won the league Rookie of the Year award. Rote Jr. further boosted his public profile by winning ABC Sports \"Superstars\" competition in 1974, 1976, and 1977. On June 15, 1975, the Tornado played the New York's Cosmos in Pele's NASL debut, a match broadcast nationally on CBS. Steve Pecher won the league Rookie of the Year award in 1976. The Tornado sold Rote Jr. at the end of the 1978 season to the Houston Hurricane for $250,000.\n\nAs was the case with most NASL clubs, a drop in attendance contributed to the demise of the club in 1981. The \"Dallas Morning News\" estimated Hunt and McNutt's cumulative financial loss over 15 years at a minimum of $20 million.\nAfter the 1981 season Hunt and McNutt decided to merge their team with the Tampa Bay Rowdies franchise, while retaining a minority stake in the Florida club.\n\nLamar Hunt did not give up on soccer in America, however, and was one of the founding owners in Major League Soccer.\n\nEx-Manchester United goalkeeper, Alex Stepney played for Dallas.\n\nIn March 1971 the league staged its first ever indoor event, a four-team Hoc-Soc tournament at the St. Louis Arena. Dallas won both of its matches, 2–1 and 3–0, and the title. In the winter of 1975, the NASL organized a two-tiered, 16 team indoor tournament with four regional winners meeting in a \"final-four\" style championship. Dallas hosted their region at the Fair Park Coliseum and won the group. Though they lost in the semi-final, the Tornado rebounded to win the 3rd place game 2–0 over New York at the Cow Palace. In 1976 they again advanced out of their group, this time as a wild card, but lost both the semi-final and the third-place match at the Bayfront Center. In January 1979 the Tornado joined the Tulsa Roughnecks, Ft. Lauderdale Strikers and host Tampa Bay Rowdies for the two-day Budweiser Invitational. They won both games, and the mini-tournament itself on goal differential. Tornado forward Jimmy Ryan was the leading scorer of the invitational with 7 goals. Dallas participated in only one full NASL indoor season, 1980–81, before folding.\n\nNASL Championships (1)\n\nNASL Season Premierships (1)\n\nNASL Indoor Championships (2)\n\nDivision/Region Titles (5)\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nLeague Scoring Champion\n\nLeague Goal Scoring Champion\n\nLeague Leading Goaltender\n\nIndoor MVP\n\nIndoor Scoring Champion\n\nIndoor Leading Goaltender\n\nAll-Star First Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Second Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Honorable Mentions\n\nIndoor All-Stars\n\nU.S. Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nIndoor Soccer Hall of Fame\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954269", "title": "Candy Jones", "text": "Candy Jones\n\nCandy Jones, originally known as Jessica Arline Wilcox (December 31, 1925 – January 18, 1990), was an American fashion model, writer and radio talk show hostess.\n\nBorn in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, she was raised and educated in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, she was a leading model and pin-up girl, and afterward, established a modeling school and wrote several books on modeling and fashion. In 1972, Jones married the popular radio show host Long John Nebel (he was her second husband), and became the co-host of his all-night talk-show on WMCA in New York City. The show dealt with paranormal, UFO, and conspiracy theory claims.\n\nJones controversially claimed to be a victim of Project MKULTRA, the CIA mind-control program, in the 1960s.\n\nCandy Jones was born to a well-off family. Jones reported vivid, conscious memories of physical abuse by her parents and vague memories of sexual abuse in her youth. She was shuttled among relatives, and her mother, Jones insisted, often kept her cloistered or locked in dark rooms. As a child, Jones said she had an imaginary friend named Arlene to help through her lonely episodes.\n\nJones grew into an attractive, statuesque young woman, about . Changing her name, she pursued a career as a fashion model. She was a quick success, becoming a runner up for Miss New Jersey in the Miss America contest. Jones was able to parlay this into a hostess job at the main Miss America contest, and a successful career. She was one of the leading pin-up girls of the World War II era: In one month in 1943, she appeared on 11 magazine covers.\n\nDuring a lengthy United Service Organizations (USO) tour in the Philippines, Jones fell ill in 1945, and was treated by a doctor who was still alive when Candy publicised her mind-control claims; Donald Bain gave this doctor the alias \"Gilbert Jensen\". According to researcher Martin Cannon, who interviewed Jones before she died in 1990, the \"Marshall Burger\" alias in Bain's book who worked with Jensen on the Jones case was actually Dr. William S. Kroger, a psychologist at one time associated with UCLA.\n\nIn 1946, Jones married fashion czar Harry Conover, one of the first model agents. They had three sons, and Jones says she didn't realize Conover was bisexual until some years into their marriage. She recognized some people might consider this naive, but Jones insisted her abusive childhood had made her wary of intimate relationships, and though she had many suitors, she was sexually inexperienced when she married. She reported that Conover initiated sexual activities with her very few times, and only when he was intoxicated.\n\nWithout notice, Conover disappeared in late 1958. Jones notified police, and Conover's absence made the news. When he returned after a long binge, Jones sued for divorce in 1959. After the divorce, she was left with $36, and considerable debts.\n\nJones opened a modeling school, and she began appearing regularly on NBC's weekend radio news program \"Monitor\".\n\nOn December 31, 1972, Jones married radio host Long John Nebel after a one-month courtship; they briefly met decades earlier when Nebel was a photographer. Jones was soon the regular co-host of Nebel's popular overnight radio talk show, which usually discussed various paranormal topics.\n\nShortly after their marriage, Nebel said he noted that Jones exhibited violent mood swings, and at times, seemed to display a different personality. Nebel called this \"The Voice ... a look, a few moments of bitchiness.\" 'The Voice' usually vanished rather quickly, but the change was so drastic from Jones's usually pleasant demeanor that Nebel was startled and distressed.\n\nColin Bennett writes, \nA few weeks after their marriage, [Jones] did tell Nebel that she had worked for the FBI for some time, adding mysteriously that she might have to go out of town on occasion without giving a reason. This left Nebel wondering whether there was a connection between the 'other' personality within Candy and the strange trips she said she made for the FBI.\n\nNebel began hypnotising Jones, and uncovered an alternate personality named \"Arlene\". Under hypnosis, Jones related a lengthy, elaborate account of her being trained in a CIA mind-control program, often at west coast colleges and universities. Jones and Nebel eventually recorded hundreds of hours of these hypnotic sessions.\n\nJones said she had some conscious memories of her involvement in the mind-control program: it began in 1960, she said, when an old USO acquaintance (an unnamed retired army general) asked to use Jones' modeling school as a mailing address to receive some letters and packages. Jones agreed, she said, out of a sense of patriotism.\n\nEventually, said Jones, she was asked to deliver a letter to Oakland, California on a business trip she had scheduled. Again, Jones reported she agreed, and was surprised to discover the letter was delivered to the same Dr. Jensen who had treated her in the Philippines nearly two decades earlier. Jones said that Jensen and his associate, Dr. \"Marshall Burger\" (another alias) offered hefty amounts of cash if she was willing to engage in further plans; in their earlier meetings, Jensen had noted that Jones was an ideal subject for hypnosis. Jones agreed, she said, because her modeling school was faltering, and she wanted to keep her sons in their costly private schools.\n\nDuring hypnosis sessions, an alternate personality called \"Arlene\" was reportedly groomed by Jensen, so that Jones would have no memory of Arlene's activities. Jones allegedly made trips to locations as far away as Taiwan. While hypnotized, Jones claimed that she was subjected to painful torture in order to test the effectiveness of the alternate personality. Donald Bain writes, \"[Jones] would be a messenger for the agency in conjunction with her normal business trips.\"\n\nAgain with the USO, Jones visited South Vietnam in 1970; she later suspected her visit had some connection to a disastrous attempt to free American prisoners of war from North Vietnam.\n\nJones's and Nebel's claims were first made public in 1976 (in Donald Bain's \"The Control of Candy Jones\", published by Playboy Press). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a hoaxer of long standing and as he was not above hoaxing his radio audience, some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's past were genuine. Later skeptics would argue that an alleged false memory syndrome was a more plausible explanation.\n\nSeveral years later, Jones' story gained more notice after the public disclosure of MK-ULTRA in 1977.\n\nBain reported that associates in Jones' modeling schools asserted that Jones indeed had some puzzling absences – supposed business trips where little or no business seemed to be conducted. Bain also writes that another piece of evidence came forth when \"Candy inadvertently held onto a passport of 'Arlene Grant': Candy in a dark wig and dark makeup\". Jones says she had no memory of dressing in such an outfit or of posing for a passport in a different name.\n\nBain also claimed that a tape-recorded message on an answering machine was left on Jones and Nebel's home telephone number on July 3, 1973:\n\nThis is Japan Airlines calling on oh-three July at 4.10 p.m. ... Please have Miss Grant call 759-9100 ... she is holding a reservation on Japan Airlines Flight 5 for the sixth of July, Kennedy to Tokyo, with an option on to Taipei. This is per Cynthia that we are calling. \n\nWhen Jones telephoned the number and asked for Cynthia, she was told that no one of that name worked at the reservations desk.\n\nAdditionally, Brian Haughton notes that \n\nThere was also a letter [Jones] wrote to her attorney, William Williams, to cover herself in case she died or disappeared suddenly or under unusual circumstances; she told him she was not at liberty to reveal exactly what she was involved in. Bain wrote to Williams who corroborated this fact.\n\nBain also notes that in 1971, an article by hypnosis expert George Estabrooks was published in \"Science Digest\", wherein Estabrooks openly discussed the successful creation of amnesiac couriers of the type Jones claimed to have been.\n\nDr. Herbert Spiegel, a nationally recognized hypnosis expert, wrote the foreword to \"The Control of Candy Jones\".\n\nCandy Jones is the subject of the Exit Clov song \"MK ULTRA.\"\n\nThe story of her mind-control claims was featured in an episode of \"\" in a segment entitled \"Sexy Secret Agent\".\n\nJones died of cancer on January 18, 1990 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and had been living in Manhattan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954272", "title": "Currys", "text": "Currys\n\nCurrys is a British electrical retailer operating in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, owned by Dixons Carphone. It specialises in selling home electronics and household appliances, with 295 megastores and 73 high street shops. Smaller shops also trade under the Currys Digital brand in the United Kingdom, which was introduced to rebrand all former Dixons shops in April 2006.\n\nDixons shops in Ireland followed in August 2008, without the Digital suffix. Many of its physical shops in the United Kingdom now trade under the combined Currys PC World brand.\n\nCurrys was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry (born in Leicester in 1850), when he started to build bicycles full time at 40 Painter Street, Leicester, England. He opened his first shop in 1888, at 271 Belgrave Gate, Leicester. In 1890, he moved to larger premises at 296 Belgrave Gate, then in 1900 to 285–287 Belgrave Gate. There was an unrecorded fire in one of the shops in 1891.\n\nThe company was put on a proper financial footing in 1897, when Curry formed a partnership with his sons, calling the company H. Curry & Sons. The business continued to grow and floated on the stock exchange in 1898. \n\nBy this time, the shops sold a wide variety of goods including bicycles, toys, radios and gramophones. Currys pulled out of cycle manufacturing in 1932, when they closed their Leicester factory, but continued to retail bikes (badged as Currys) until the 1960s. \n\nMeanwhile, particularly under the directorship of family member Dennis Curry between 1967 and 1984, Currys underwent considerable expansion becoming a major high street supplier of televisions and whitegoods (refrigerators, washing machines and other domestic appliances); by 1984 Currys Group PLC (Currys) was a chain of 570 shops, twice as many as the company which was then to acquire it.\n\nCurrys was taken over by Dixons (now Dixons Carphone, owners of the Dixons electrical products retail chain) in 1984, but maintained its separate brand identity. In April 2006, DSG announced that its Dixons shops (except in Ireland and in duty free areas in airports) would be rebranded as Currys.digital, making a total of 550 Currys shops in all. \n\nHowever, in August 2008, the Dixons shops in Ireland were rebranded as Currys, similar to the move in the United Kingdom, but without the \".digital\" suffix and with a new Currys logo. Before the Dixons rebranding, the chain contained only a few small town centre shops compared with its much greater number of large out of town megastores. \n\nThese shops are generally split into four main departments; computing, home entertainment, major domestic appliances and small domestic appliances. The shops are a mix of display products and self service sections. On 17 January 2007, group chief executive John Clare announced that when the leases on the remaining 'Currys High Street' shops (not the rebranded Currys.digital shops) expired, it would be unlikely that they would be renewed: thus the shops will be closed at the earliest opportunity.\n\nDixons Retail began a trial combining Currys and PC World shops in January 2015, and in August declared it to be a success. A number of shops have since been combined, with their shop formats merged into one. In some cases, this has also involved the physical knocking together of some shops which were adjacently located. All advertising for the electronics side of both chains has now been merged.\n\nDuring the Dixons Carphone Christmas 2015 to 2016 results update to shareholders; Sebastian James, group chief executive for Dixons Carphone, revealed that over the following financial year the three in one shop format (shops featuring Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse branding under one roof) would be rolled out across the company's entire portfolio on the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nThe programme is expected to generate around £20 million of incremental annual earnings, due to recurring costs savings as a result of removing property from the portfolio.\n\nOn 14 May 2020 an article reported customer problems with orders during the period of the coronavirus. \n\nIn December 2011, Currys opened a new high end concept shop named \"Black\" in Birmingham, UK. The new shop stocks high end ranges, and is laid out in a more fashionable way including mannequins and 'collection' displays. The new branding and layout aims to attract more female shoppers, whom research shows feel alienated in the larger shops.\n\n"}

Early in his life he became a monk in the Benedictine abbey of Gembloux.\n\nHe was born near Gembloux which is now in the Province of Namur, Belgium, about 1030. He was apparently not of Germanic background, but seems to have been of Latin descent. He received his education at the Abbey of Gembloux, where at an early age he became a monk. Later he was for a long time a teacher at the Abbey of St. Vincent at Metz; about 1070 he returned to Gembloux. He was universally admired and venerated, and had charge there of the abbey school until his death, occupied in teaching and writing.\n\nAfter his return from Metz he became a violent imperial partisan in the great struggle between the empire and the papacy that culminated in the Investiture Controversy. He was an enemy of the papal pretensions and he took part in the momentous contest between Pope Gregory VII and the Emperor Henry IV. Of his three treatises on this question, being very serviceable to the imperial cause to the contest, one is lost; this was an answer to the letter of Gregory VII, written in 1081 to Bishop Hermann of Metz, in which Gregory asserted that the popes have the right to excommunicate kings and to release subjects from the oath of loyalty. In the second treatise Sigebert defended the masses said by married priests, the hearing of which had been forbidden by the pope in 1074. When Paschal II in 1103 ordered the Count of Flanders to punish the citizens of Liège for their adherence to the emperor and to take up arms against him, Sigebert attacked the proceeding of the pope as unchristian and contrary to Scripture.\n\nHe died at Gembloux on 5 November 1112.\n\nSigebert's most celebrated work is a \"Chronicon sive Chronographia\", or universal chronicle, that Auguste Molinier found to be the best work of its kind. It contains many errors and little original information. He desired probably merely to give a chronological survey; consequently, there is only a bare list of events even for the era in which he lived, though the last years, including 1105–1111, are treated in more detail. It covers the period between 381 and 1111, and its author was evidently a man of much learning. The first of many printed editions was published in 1513; the best is in \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica. Scriptores\" vol. VI, with introduction by Ludwig Conrad Bethmann. After Sigebert's death his chronicle was continued by Anselm of Gembloux.\n\nThe chronicle was very popular during the later Middle Ages; it gained a very high reputation, was circulated in numberless copies, and was used by many writers and found numerous continuators, serving as the basis of many later works of history. Notwithstanding various oversights and mistakes, the industry and wide reading of Sigebert deserve honorable mention. The original autograph manuscript is in the Royal Library of Belgium.\n\nOther works by Sigebert are a life of the Frankish king Sigebert III (\"Vita Sigeberti III regis Austrasiae\"), founder of the monastery of St. Martin at Metz. While at Metz he wrote the biography of Bishop Theodoric I of Metz (964–985), and also a long poem on the martyrdom of St. Lucy, whose relics were venerated at the Abbey of St. Vincent. After his return to Gembloux he also wrote similar works for this abbey, namely a long poem on the martyrdom of the Theban Legion—as Gembloux had relics of its reputed leader St. Exuperius (d. 262)—and a history of the early abbots of Gembloux to 1048 (\"Gesta abbatum Gemblacensium\").\n\nHe also made a catalogue of one hundred and seventy-one ecclesiastical writers and their works from Gennadius to his own time, \"De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis\", which mentions his own work.\n\nSigebert was also a hagiographer. Among his writings in this connexion may be mentioned revisions of the biographies of St. Maclovius and the two early bishops of Liège, Theodard of Maastricht and Lambert of Maastricht; further the \"vita\" of Dietrich, bishop of Metz (d. 984) who was the founder of the abbey of St Vincent in that city (\"Vita Deoderici, Mettensis episcopi\") and of Wicbert or Guibert (d. 962) who founded the abbey of Gembloux (\"Vita Wicberti\").\n\n\n\n"}

It has been host to concerts and sporting events. It was formerly the home of the New England Nightmare of the Women's Football Alliance (WFA). It is now the home of USL Championship club Hartford Athletic. The UConn Huskies men's and women's soccer teams played a majority of their 2019 matches at Dillon Stadium after starting their seasons at Al-Marzook Field in West Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nFounded by football coach John Dillon, Dillon Stadium was the home of two minor league football teams in the 1960s and 70s: the Hartford Charter Oaks of the Atlantic Coast Football League and Continental Football League, owned by the Brewer family, and the Hartford Knights, also of the ACFL and Seaboard Football League. Dillon is now used primarily for high school football teams, including the Bulkeley Bulldogs, the Sport Medical Tigers, the Prince Tech Falcons, and the Capital Prep Trailblazers. Dillon also hosts the annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Game between Hartford Public Owls and the Weaver Beavers. Lights were added in 1964 to accommodate the Oaks. The stadium also hosted occasional club-level college football games hosted by the University of Hartford. The Hartford Colonials of the United Football League, in part because of a change of management at Rentschler Field, experienced significant delays in renewing their lease for the 2011 season and had backup plans to relocate to Dillon Stadium (or Willow Brook Park), although neither venue was believed to be ideal for the UFL. The Colonials did sign a deal with Rentschler in June, but suspended operations on August 10, 2011; the league later folded it outright.\n\nHartford City FC, a projected indoor soccer franchise that also hoped to compete in the outdoor North American Soccer League, announced plans to reconstruct Dillon Stadium to create a 15,000 seat soccer-only stadium for the 2017 season.\n\nIn 2014, the city awarded a $12 million contract to Premier Sports Management to redevelop the stadium in hopes of attracting a professional soccer team. The company was unable to interest various soccer leagues and instead partnered with an outside investor seeking to build a larger stadium on the site with city funding. However, the city ended the project in October 2015 over financial and legal concerns with the investment group, who were later found guilty of embezzling $1 million from the redevelopment fund.\n\nOn February 17, 2018, the State Bond Commission approved $10 million in public funding. This would help the Hartford Sports Group establish a USL club in 2019.\n\nOn June 27, 1966, The Rolling Stones played in Dillon Stadium, supported by The McCoys (with their up-and-coming guitarist, Rick Derringer). Near the end of the Stones' performance, fans rushed the stage, so electricity to the amplifiers was cut. Mick Jagger threw his microphone stand out into the crowd, and the Stones then left the venue, as fans began breaking chairs. Police gathered the crowd towards the exits.\n\nThe Beach Boys performed there in 1972 and again in 1973.\n\nOn July 16, 1972, the Grateful Dead played in Dillon Stadium and were joined on stage by Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley and Jai Johanny Johanson of the Allman Brothers. Their July 31, 1974, performance at the field was released as an album titled \"Dave's Picks Volume 2\".\n\n"}

It is sometimes placed in the genus \"Spilosoma\". The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1766. It is found throughout the temperate belt of the Palearctic region south to northern Turkey, Georgia, Kazakhstan, southern Siberia (excluding Buryatia), eastern Mongolia, Amur Region, China, Korea and Japan.\n\nThe wings of this species are buffish yellow (the males tend to be more yellow than the females) and are typically marked with a diagonal row of dark spots on the forewing and a few other scattered spots on both forewings and hindwings. The extent of black markings varies considerably, however, from almost spotless examples to largely black melanic forms. The wingspan is 34–42 mm. The species flies from May to July in the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range. It is attracted to light.\n\nThe larva is pale brown and very hairy. It is polyphagous, feeding on a wide variety of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants (see list). This species overwinters as a pupa.\n\nSome larval food plants include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954283", "title": "Eastern New Mexico University", "text": "Eastern New Mexico University\n\nEastern New Mexico University (ENMU or Eastern) is a public university with a main campus in Portales, New Mexico, and two associate degree-granting branches, one at Ruidoso and one at Roswell. ENMU is New Mexico's largest regional comprehensive university and is the most recently founded state university in New Mexico (legislated in 1927, opened in 1934). It is a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution and a member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. The ENMU System consists of three campuses.\n\nThe New Mexico legislature approved the construction and staffing of a normal school in eastern New Mexico in 1927, and approved appropriation for construction in 1929, but the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression hindered the school's opening, which was delayed until 1934 (construction had begun in 1931).\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, the institution, first named Eastern New Mexico Junior College (ENMJC) operated as a community college. In 1940, the third and fourth years of college were first offered, leading to a bachelor's degree, and the institution was renamed Eastern New Mexico College (ENMC). ENMC was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools as a four-year liberal arts college in 1946–47. Graduate work leading to the master's degree in some departments was added in 1949, and on April 5, 1949, the Board of Regents approved the change of the institution's name to Eastern New Mexico University.\n\nENMU's main campus (ENMU-Portales), consisting of over , is located in Portales on the extreme eastern border of New Mexico, in the Eastern New Mexico/Llano Estacado region about halfway between the northern and southern boundaries of the state. (Portales is northeast of Roswell, southwest of Amarillo, Texas, and northwest of Lubbock, Texas.) ENMU owns KENW (TV) and KENW-FM, a public television and radio station that are housed and operated on the main campus. The president of ENMU-Portales also serves as the chancellor for the ENMU System.\n\nThe ENMU Ruidoso Campus, ENMU-Ruidoso, is a two-year college or community college (one of 18 in New Mexico) and an official branch of ENMU (branch status being granted in July 2005). Undergraduate and graduate coursework completed at the ENMU-Ruidoso campus is transferable for credit toward an undergraduate or graduate degree at ENMU-Portales, and, typically other undergraduate/graduate institutions in the United States. In 1991, the Ruidoso location had been established as the ENMU Ruidoso Branch Community College and offered two-year college academic and vocational programs. ENMU-Ruidoso offers Certificates of Completion, Associate of Science, Associate of Arts, and Associate of Applied Science degrees, as well as community education classes, customized training workshops, and adult basic education courses. It operates a One-Stop Career Center which provides free employment services for employers and job seekers in Lincoln County. The center offers both an academic and vocational curriculum. (Ruidoso is located southwest of Portales, in a mountainous region of south-central New Mexico.)\n\nThe ENMU Roswell Campus, ENMU-Roswell, also a two-year branch, offers a wide variety of programs. ENMU-Roswell was established in the fall of 1958. In the spring of 1967, the institution moved to 12 buildings on of the former Walker Air Force Base. Roswell is one of New Mexico's larger cities, located in the southeast section of the state.\n\nENMU also offers online degrees. ENMU's online degrees in the fields of business and education are the most affordable in the U.S.\n\nENMU-Portales consists of four colleges and a graduate school:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong ENMU's other facilities are 5 museums, an art gallery, and a library.\n\nThe Golden Student Success Center (GSSC) construction was completed in 2018 replacing the original Golden Library building. The building now houses the Golden Library, the Runnels Gallery and the offices of Tutoring and Supplemental Instruction and Distance Learning.\n\nThe Golden Library features General Collections, Special Collections and Government Information. Special Collections includes the Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library, Southwest Collection (including New Mexico collections), University archives, and local history. The General Collection includes newspapers, serials, juvenile books, and K-12 curriculum materials.\n\nThe Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library is part of the Special Collections and has one of the top science fiction collections in the world with over 30,000 volumes, including science fiction books, science fiction pulp magazines dating back to the early 1900s, manuscripts, correspondence, and photographs.\n\nThe Runnels Gallery is an exhibit space open to the public that features art by ENMU students, ENMU faculty, and guest artists. Runnels Gallery has hosted national juried exhibitions for artists working in various mediums including two-dimensional, three-dimensional and photography.\n\nThe Dr. Antonio Gennaro Natural History Museum is affiliated with the ENMU Department of Biology. The purpose of the museum is to educate the public about the diversity of life while emphasizing the natural heritage of eastern New Mexico and the greater Southwest, particularly the Llano Estacado. Formerly known as the Eastern New Mexico University Natural History Museum, the museum was renamed and dedicated to Dr. Gennaro in spring 2016. In addition to the taxidermy and study skins on display, the museum features a live animal exhibit with both native and non-native species. Gennaro came to ENMU in 1966 as an associate professor of biological sciences and went on to become a nationally recognized researcher. He started ENMU's vertebrate collection for the museum. He authored and published two books, \"Nature's Way\" and \"Wildlife Falsehoods\".\n\nThe original Blackwater Draw Museum opened in 1969 at the midway point between Clovis and Portales to display artifacts uncovered at the Blackwater Locality No. 1 site and illustrate life at the Blackwater Draw site during the Clovis period (over 13,000 years ago) through the recent historic period. In 2017, the museum was moved to the ENMU campus and expanded to more broadly incorporate anthropology and related topics.\n\nThe Miles Mineral Museum features a comprehensive collection of geological specimens representative of the Pecos River valley area, as well as a sampling of specimens from other regions, including several meteorites. The bulk of the objects contained within the museum were once part of the private collection of amateur geologists and mineral enthusiasts, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Miles. ENMU purchased the [approximately] 2,500 piece collection of geological, archaeological, and anthropological specimens from the couple in 1967. Many additional specimens have been added to the museum over the years since that time. The entire collection was originally displayed at a single ENMU facility named the Miles Museum, which opened in 1969. In 1984 the objects in the collection were divided up into two categories, and two separate museums were formed to display them; the Miles Mineral Museum and the Miles Anthropology Museum. The Miles Mineral Museum is now located in Roosevelt Hall, adjacent to the Dr. Antonio Gennaro Natural History museum, on the ENMU campus.\n\nMr. Fred Miles and Mrs. Gladys Miles began collecting mineral and fossil specimens along the Pecos River after they moved to Roswell, New Mexico, in 1928. They were prolific collectors for 40 years, scouring the Pecos River valley for specimens. They particularly enjoyed finding native American artifacts and a specific type of quartz crystal formation referred to as Pecos Diamonds. For several decades they displayed the majority of their enormous collection at a Texaco service station in Roswell operated by Mr. Miles, who enjoyed showing it to inquisitive customers.\n\nThe Miles Anthropology Museum is home to various anthropological and archeological specimens collected by amateur anthropologists Fred and Gladys Miles, as well as to other collections from digs in the region. The private collection of Mr. and Mrs. Miles was also used as the foundation of the Miles Mineral Museum. Both museums are located in Roosevelt Hall in a space that was once the first dining hall on the campus.\n\nENMU's athletic teams participate in the NCAA Division II Lone Star Conference. The men's and women's teams are nicknamed the Greyhounds. Prior to 2015, the women's teams were nicknamed the Zias. In early 2015, students, faculty and staff voted to discontinue the Zia nickname and the women's teams become Greyhounds alongside the men's teams. ENMU vacated five seasons of wins in several sports starting from the 2008–09 season after the university self-reported over 100 eligibility violations.\n\nENMU currently features two active associated social fraternities and two active associated social sororities. Historically, the school featured several additional social fraternities. The school also features several honors fraternities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His poem \"Jours Passés\" was set in music by Léo Delibes under the title \"Regrets\".\n\nHis volumes of verse include:\n\nThe poet was also a contributor to \"Gil Blas\" and other Parisian journals, distinguishing himself by the licence he permitted himself.

{"id": "1954311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954311", "title": "Silent Night, Deadly Night", "text": "Silent Night, Deadly Night\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night is a 1984 American slasher film directed by Charles E. Sellier, Jr., and starring Robert Brian Wilson, Lilyan Chauvin, Gilmer McCormick, Toni Nero, Linnea Quigley, Britt Leach, and Leo Geter. The story concerns a young man named Billy, who suffers from posttraumatic stress over witnessing his parents' murder on Christmas Eve and his subsequent upbringing in an abusive Catholic orphanage. In adulthood, the Christmas holiday leads him into a psychological breakdown, and he emerges as a spree killer donning a Santa suit.\n\nThe film was released by TriStar Pictures on November 9, 1984, where it received substantial controversy over its promotional material and content, which featured a killer Santa Claus. In addition to receiving negative reviews, it was pulled from theaters a week after its release. However, it was a success during its opening week, grossing $2.5 million on a budget of $750,000. Since its release, it has developed a cult following and spawned a series, consisting of four sequels, with the fourth and fifth installments having no connection to the original film, as well as a loose remake in 2012.\n\nIn 1971, five-year-old Billy Chapman and his family go to visit a nursing home where his catatonic grandfather stays; when Billy remains alone with him for a few minutes, his grandfather suddenly awakens and tells Billy to fear Santa Claus, as he gives presents only to the children who have been good all year, and punishes the ones who have been naughty, no matter how briefly. While driving back, a man dressed in a Santa outfit seemingly has car trouble and gets Billy's family's attention to pull over and help. As they pull over, the Santa-clad criminal shoots the father with a pistol and forcibly removes the mother and slashes her throat with a switchblade in front of Billy and his baby brother Ricky. Billy runs off to hide, leaving Ricky in the car.\n\nThree years later in 1974, Billy and Ricky are celebrating Christmas in an orphanage run by Mother Superior, a strict disciplinarian who persistently strikes children who misbehave and considers punishment to be a necessary and good thing. Sister Margaret, the only one who sympathizes with the children, tries to help Billy play with the other children, but Billy is constantly subject to Mother Superior's scrutinizing eyes and regularly punished. On Christmas morning, the orphanage invites a man in a Santa Claus suit to visit the children; Billy gets dragged by Mother Superior and he punches the man before fleeing to his room in horror.\n\n10 years later, in the spring of 1984, a now-adult Billy leaves the orphanage to find a normal life, and obtains a job as a stock boy at a local toy store, thanks to Sister Margaret. At the store, he develops a crush on his co-worker Pamela; he has sexual thoughts regarding her which are often interrupted by morbid visions of his parents' murders. On Christmas Eve, the employee who plays the store's Santa Claus has been injured the night before and as a result Billy's boss Mr. Sims makes him take his place. After the store closes, the staff has a Christmas Eve party. Billy (still dressed in a Santa Claus suit) tries to have a good time at the party, but he keeps having memories of his parents' murders, causing him to feel depressed. At one point, he sees his co-worker Andy making out with Pamela and they both walk into the back room. Billy walks after them and sees Andy trying to rape Pamela. This finally, psychologically, triggers his insanity; he hangs Andy with a string of Christmas lights and stabs Pamela with a utility knife, uttering darkly that punishment is good. \n\nA highly intoxicated Mr. Sims goes into the back room to check on the noises he heard. Just when he is about to leave, Billy murders him with a hammer. Billy turns off the store's lights, causing his manager, Mrs. Randall, to go check out the back room. She screams at the sight of Mr. Sims' corpse and tries to call police, but Billy cuts the phone line using a double-bit axe, causing her to run and hide. Billy walks around the store trying to find her and, at one point, Mrs. Randall jumps out and trips Billy, stealing his axe. Before she can escape, Billy shoots and kills her with a bow and arrow.\n\nAs Sister Margaret discovers the carnage and returns to the orphanage to seek help via telephone, Billy breaks into a nearby house where a young couple named Denise and Tommy are having sex and a little girl named Cindy is sleeping; Billy then impales Denise on a set of deer antlers and throws Tommy through a window. When this awakens Cindy, Billy then confronts her and asks her if she has been nice or naughty; she says she has been nice, and he gives her the utility knife he had used earlier. After this, he witnesses bullies picking on two sledding teenage boys and decapitates one of the bullies with his axe as the other screams in horror.\n\nThe next morning, the orphanage is secured with Officer Barnes and Captain Richards aided by Sister Margaret, who knows that Billy has committed the murders. The deaf pastor, Father O'Brien, who was dressed in a Santa outfit, is mistakenly shot by Barnes upon coming forward, mistaking him to be Billy. Barnes is then axed by Billy while distracted. Due to his Santa outfit, Billy gains access into the orphanage and confronts Mother Superior, now in a wheelchair. She taunts Billy due to her disbelief in Santa Claus and just as he prepares to kill her with his axe, Richards appears and shoots him in the back, much to Sister Margaret's shock. As the dying Billy lays on the ground, he utters to the nearby children \"You're safe now, Santa Claus is gone.\" before succumbing to his wounds. As the children gather around, Ricky, coldly staring at Mother Superior, utters \"Naughty\".\n\nInitially throughout production, the film was titled as \"Slayride\", before TriStar decided to change the title to \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\". The film was shot on location in Salt Lake City and Heber City, Utah.\n\nBecause director Charles E. Sellier Jr. was uncomfortable with shooting the death scenes, the film's editor Michael Spence came in as the co-director for the film.\n\nThe film was released theatrically by TriStar Pictures on November 9, 1984, opening in 398 theaters in the North East and Midwest United States. On its opening weekend, the film finished eighth, grossing $1,432,800. It outgrossed Wes Craven's landmark slasher \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", which opened the same day (albeit in 235 fewer theaters). Before being pulled from theaters, it grossed over $2.4 million in its first 10 days of release.\n\nIn November 2013, it was announced that \"Fangoria\" in association with Brainstorm Media and Screenvision would be re-releasing the film to theaters in the United States throughout December 2013.\n\n\"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" was one of the most controversial films of the 1980s due to its advertising campaign, particularly its posters and TV spots, that made significant emphasis on the killer being dressed as Santa Claus. The PTA fought to have this film removed from theaters due to its subject matter and the fact that it was shown around Christmas, although an earlier film with a similar premise, \"Christmas Evil\", had gone unnoticed. Television advertisements, which aired between episodes of family-friendly series such as \"Three's Company\" and \"Little House on the Prairie\", led to parents complaining that their children were terrified of Santa Claus. Large crowds (mostly angry families) formed at theaters and malls around the nation to protest the film; at the film's East Coast premiere at the Interboro Quad Theater in The Bronx in New York City, protesters picketed the theater and sang Christmas carols in protest. \n\nIn response, TriStar Pictures, the film's original distributor, pulled all ads for the film six days after its release on November 15, 1984. The film itself was also withdrawn shortly thereafter, due to the controversy. In response to the public outcry, producer Ira Barmak told \"People\" magazine: \"People have taken offense at Santa being used in a scary context... Santa Claus is not a religious figure, he's a mythic character. I didn't deliberately ride roughshod over that sensitivity and I didn't anticipate the objection to it.\" An editorial published in \"Variety\" stated: \"Most protests were generated by the feeling that the depiction of a killer in a Santa Claus suit would traumatize children and undermine their traditional trust in Santa Claus.\" When the film was castigated at length by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, the backlash against the film became louder and more widespread.\n\nThe film was due to be re-released by an independent distributor, Aquarius Films, in May 1985, with an ad campaign replacing the original \"Twas the night before Christmas\"-themed trailer with a new one that centered on the controversy surrounding the film and edited out all close-up shots of Billy, in the Santa suit, with weapons. The print ad material also replaced the original 'Chimney' picture with one that talked about the controversy. However, the film only had further test engagements.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the movie was never submitted for certification to the BBFC, and its sequel was denied a video certificate in 1987 after the distributors refused to make the cuts required for an '18' certificate. However, in 2009, Arrow Films submitted the film to the BBFC for classification, who passed the film uncut with an 18 certificate. The UK DVD was released on November 23, 2009.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" holds a 32% approval rating based on 19 critic reviews, with an average rating of 3.94/10.\n\nSiskel and Ebert condemned the film and Siskel went as far as to read names of the film's production crew on air, telling them, \"Shame on you\". Siskel also said that all the money the filmmakers were making off of this film was blood money. Leonard Maltin also denounced the film, calling it a \"...worthless splatter film\", giving it zero stars and asking: \"What's next, the Easter Bunny as a child killer?\" A \"Daily Variety\" review argued that whatever arguments the film was making on the commercialism of Christmas was overshadowed by the graphic violence, which the reviewer saw as off-putting. Michael Wilmington wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\": \"[it's] safe to predict that \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\"… will start making ‘Worst Movie of All Time’ lists almost immediately\". One positive notice came from Kirk Ellis from \"The Hollywood Reporter\", who complimented director Sellier's \"workmanlike competence\" and praised the cinematography and Gilmer McCormack's performance as Sister Margaret.\n\nThe film was originally released on VHS in 1986 through USA Home Video. In 1987, The film was re-released on VHS tape by International Video Entertainment. By 1991, the film's home video rights were transferred to Avid Home Entertainment, which was released that same year.\n\nThe film was released three times on DVD in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment. The first release was a double feature disc alongside sequel \"Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2\" in 2003. The second release was in 2007. The first two Region 1 releases are currently out of print.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2009 by Arrow Video; this set includes an audio interview with director Charles E. Sellier Jr., poster, booklet including \"Deadly Director: Charles Sellier Interviewed by Calum Waddell\" and \"Silent Night, Sex Night: The Slice and Times of Linnea Quigley\".\n\nOn December 4, 2012, the film was again released alongside \"Part 2\" as a two-disc \"Christmas Survival Double Feature\", containing the same archival bonus features as the 2003 release.\n\nOn September 16, 2014, the film was released on Blu-ray by Anchor Bay/Starz Entertainment. No new special features were included, with the exception of a few new commentaries, none of which any of the actors participated in. The Blu-ray contains exactly the same release as previous DVD editions with the extended scenes edited back into the film with noticeable picture quality changes. There has yet to be a release of the full, uncut print from a single source.\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Shout! Factory, under its Scream Factory label, released the film in a two-disc set collector's edition on Blu-ray and DVD. It contains the film remastered in a 4K resolution from the original negative. It also contained new special features such as an interview and audio commentary from actors Robert Brian Wilson and Linnea Quigley, co-executive producers Scott J. Schneid and Dennis Whitehead, writer Michael Hickey, music composer Perry Botkin, and editor Michael Spence. It also contained a new documentary on the making of the film entitled \"Slay Bells Ring: The Story of Silent Night, Deadly Night\" which included interviews from the cast and crew. The original theatrical trailer, radio and TV spots are included. It also contained the original special features from the 2003 and 2012 DVD and 2014 Blu-ray releases as well.\n\nScream Factory also released a limited edition deluxe offer that contained the collector's edition set along with a 18x24 size poster of the new artwork for the film, as well as an 8\" tall figure of Billy in his Santa suit holding his double-bit axe. This offer was limited to 2,000 orders and pre-orders started on September 7, 2017.\n\nDue to the minor success of the film, four sequels were created, two of which, \"Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2\" and \"\", focus on Billy's younger brother Ricky turning evil and becoming a serial killer similar to his older brother, in which he was killed from having become insane because of his past. \"\" and \"\", however, are entirely different, and each focuses on a different Christmas-themed horror story.\n\nA loose remake of the film, titled \"Silent Night\", was released on December 4, 2012, starring Jaime King and Malcolm McDowell.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954315", "title": "Hackathon", "text": "Hackathon\n\nA hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest; a portmanteau of \"hacking marathon)\" is a design sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.\n\nThe goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created.\n\nThe word \"hackathon\" is a portmanteau of the words \"hack\" and \"marathon\", where \"hack\" is used in the sense of exploratory programming, not its alternate meaning as a reference to breaching computer security.\n\nOpenBSD's apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where ten developers came together to avoid legal problems caused due to export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States. Since then, a further three-to-five events per year have occurred around the world to advance development, generally on university campuses.\n\nFor Sun Microsystems, the usage referred to an event at the JavaOne conference from June 15 to June 19, 1999; there John Gage challenged attendees to write a program in Java for the new Palm V using the infrared port to communicate with other Palm users and register it on the Internet.\n\nStarting in the mid to late 2000s, hackathons became significantly more widespread and began to be increasingly viewed by companies and venture capitalists as a way to quickly develop new software technologies, and to locate new areas for innovation and funding. Some major companies were born from these hackathons, such as GroupMe, which began as a project at a hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2010 conference; in 2011 it was acquired by Skype for $85 million. The software PhoneGap began as a project at the iPhoneDevCamp (later renamed iOSDevCamp) in 2008; the company whose engineers developed PhoneGap, Nitobi, refocused itself around PhoneGap, and Nitobi was bought by Adobe in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nHackathons typically start with one or more presentations about the event, as well as about the specific subject, if any. Then participants suggest ideas and form teams, based on individual interests and skills. Then the main work of the hackathon begins, which can last anywhere from several hours to several days. For hackathons that last 24 hours or longer, especially competitive ones, eating is often informal, with participants often subsisting on food like pizza and energy drinks. Sometimes sleeping is informal as well, with participants sleeping on-site with sleeping bags.\n\nAt the end of hackathons, there is usually a series of demonstrations in which each group presents their results. To capture the great ideas and work-in-progress often people post a video of the demonstrations, blog about results with screenshots and details, share links and progress on social media, suggest a place for open source code and generally make it possible for people to share, learn from and possibly build from the ideas generated and initial work completed. There is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given. At many hackathons, the judges are made up of organisers and sponsors. At BarCamp-style hackathons, that are organised by the development community, such as iOSDevCamp, the judges are usually made up of peers and colleagues in the field. Such prizes are sometimes a substantial amount of money: a social gaming hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference offered $250,000 in funding to the winners, while a controversial 2013 hackathon run by Salesforce.com had a payout of $1 million to the winners, billed as the largest-ever prize.\n\nSome hackathons focus on a particular platform such as mobile apps, a desktop operating system, web development or video game development.\n\nMobile app hackathons like Over the Air, held at Phoenix Park, Ireland, can see a large amount of corporate sponsorship and interest.\n\nMusic Hack Day, a hackathon for music-related software and hardware applications, is a popular event, having been held over 30 times around the world since 2009. Also Music Tech Fest, a three-day interdisciplinary festival for music ideas bringing together musicians with hackers, researchers and industry, features a hackathon. Similarly, Science Hack Day, a hackathon for making things with science, has been held over 45 times in over 15 countries around the world since 2010.\n\nHackathons have been held to develop applications that run on various mobile device operating systems, such as Android, iOS and MeeGo. Hackathons have also been held to develop video-based applications and computer games. Hackathons where video games are developed are sometimes called game jams.\n\n\"TV Hackfest\" events have been held in both London and San Francisco, focusing mainly on social television and second screen technologies. In TV Hackfests, challenge briefs are typically submitted by content producers and brands, in the form of broadcast industry metadata or video content, while sponsors supply APIs, SDKs and pre-existing open source software code.\n\nHackathons have also been used in the life sciences to advance the informatics infrastructure that supports research. The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ran two hackathons for its member projects in 2002 and 2003, and since 2010 has held 2-day \"codefests\" preceding its annual conference. The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has co-organized and sponsored hackathons for evolutionary bioinformatics since 2006. BioHackathon is an annual event that started in 2008 targeted at advancing standards to enable interoperable bioinformatics tools and Web services. Neuroscientists have also used hackathons to bring developers and scientists together to address issues that range from focusing on a specific information system (e.g., Neurosynth Hackathon and the Allen Brain Atlas Hackathon) and providing reserved time for broad scientific inquiry (e.g., Brainhack), to using specific challenges that focus hacking activity (e.g., HBM Hackathon).\n\nThere have been hackathons devoted to creating applications that use a specific language or framework, like JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5 and Ruby on Rails.\n\nSome hackathons focus on applications that make use of the application programming interface, or API, from a single company or data source. Open Hack, an event run publicly by Yahoo! since 2006 (originally known as \"Hack Day\", then \"Open Hack Day\"), has focused on usage of the Yahoo! API, in addition to APIs of websites owned by Yahoo!, like Flickr. The company's Open Hack India event in 2012 had over 700 attendees. Google has run similar events for their APIs, as has the travel guide company Lonely Planet.\n\nThe website Foursquare notably held a large, global hackathon in 2011, in which over 500 developers at over 30 sites around the world competed to create applications using the Foursquare API. A second Foursquare hackathon, in 2013, had around 200 developers. The IETF organizes Hackathons for each IETF meetings which are focused on IETF Internet Draft and IETF RFC implementation for better inter-operability and improved Internet Standards.\n\nThere have been a number of hackathons devoted to improving government, and specifically to the cause of open government. One such event, in 2011, was hosted by the United States Congress. Starting in 2012, NASA has been annually hosting the International Space Apps Challenge.\n\nIn 2014, the British government and HackerNest ran DementiaHack, the world's first hackathon dedicated to improving the lives of people living with dementia and their caregivers. The series continues in 2015, adding the Canadian government and Facebook as major sponsors.\n\nThe Global Game Jam, the largest video game development hackathon, often includes optional requirements called 'diversifiers' that aim to promote game accessibility and other causes.\n\nVarious hackathons have been held to improve city transit systems. Hackathons aimed at improvements to city local services are increasing, with one of the London Councils (Hackney) creating a number of successful local solutions with a two-day Hackney-thon. There have also been a number of hackathons devoted to improving education, including Education Hack Day and on a smaller scale, looking specifically at the challenges of field work based geography education, the Field Studies Council hosted FSCHackday. Random Hacks of Kindness is another popular hackathon, devoted to disaster management and crisis response.\nThePort instead is a hackathon devoted to solving humanitarian, social and public interest challenges. It's hosted by CERN with partners from other non-governmental organizations such as ICRC and UNDP.\n\nA number of hackathons around the world have been planned in memory of computer programmer and internet activist Aaron Swartz, who died in 2013.\n\nSome hackathons are intended only for programmers within a certain demographic group, like teenagers, college students, or women.\n\nHackathons at colleges have become increasingly popular, in the United States and elsewhere. These are usually annual or semiannual events that are open to college students at all universities. They are often competitive, with awards provided by the University or programming-related sponsors. Many of them are supported by the organization Major League Hacking, which was founded in 2013 to assist with the running of collegiate hackathons.\n\nPennApps at the University of Pennsylvania was the first student-run college hackathon; in 2015 it became the largest college hackathon with its 12th iteration hosting over 2000 people and offering over $60k in prizes. The University of Mauritius Computer Club and Cyberstorm.mu organized a Hackathon dubbed \"Code Wars\" focused on implementing an IETF RFC in Lynx in 2017.\n\nShamHacks at Missouri University of Science and Technology is held annually as an outreach activity of the campus's Curtis Laws Wilson Library. ShamHacks 2018 focused on problem statements to better quality of life factors for US veterans, by pairing with veteran-owned company sponsors.\n\nSome companies hold internal hackathons to promote new product innovation by the engineering staff. For example, Facebook's Like button was conceived as part of a hackathon.\n\nSome hackathons (such as StartupBus, founded in 2010 in Australia) combine the competitive element with a road trip, to connect local tech communities in multiple cities along the bus routes. This is now taking place across North America, Europe, Africa and Australasia.\n\nIn some hackathons, all work is on a single application, such as an operating system, programming language, or content management system. Such events are often known as \"code sprints\", and are especially popular for open source software projects, where such events are sometimes the only opportunity for developers to meet face-to-face.\n\nCode sprints typically last from one week to three weeks and often take place near conferences at which most of the team attend. Unlike other hackathons, these events rarely include a competitive element.\n\nThe annual hackathon to work on the operating system OpenBSD, held since 1999, is one such event; it may have originated the word \"hackathon\".\n\n\n\n"}

It covers the escape of convict Lamar Pye and two accomplices from a penitentiary in the mid-western USA, and highway patrol officer Bud Pewtie's attempts to track them down.\n\nThe events in the novel are set in between \"Point of Impact\" and \"Black Light\", the first and second novels in the Bob Lee Swagger series.\n\nThe opening chapters of \"Dirty White Boys\" articulately sets an impressionable tone for the remainder of the novel, as the story's main antagonist, Lamar Pye, a physically powerful, charismatic, aggressive, and intelligent \"alpha male\" in his late thirties, uses brutal violence to avoid being raped by a giant black inmate in the showers at McAlester State Penitentiary (the Mac). Despite his position as a \"Prince\" (a ranking prisoner) amongst the Dirty White Boys, a white gang element of the prisoner populace, the rape was ordered as revenge for a slight made by Lamar's retarded, behemoth cousin Odell against the white gang chief. After his sale to the black inmate gang, Lamar knows that the revenge is inevitable if he remains in the prison. Richard, Lamar's failed artist cell mate, a timid man imprisoned for the gruesome murder of his own mother, joins Lamar as he uses his quick wit and unrestrained capacity for violence to abscond \"the Mac\" with Odell.\n\nBud Pewtie, the novel's main protagonist, is a State Trooper called to participate in the search for the escaped criminals. He is initially portrayed as a responsible father with two teenage boys, but it quickly emerges that he is having an affair with the young wife of his partner, Ted, a confused young man with unarticulated doubts about his role as a trooper. The troopers are briefed about the escape by the embittered alcoholic Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation Lieutenant C. D. Henderson, a once star law enforcement officer who once served with Earl Swagger as a detective. A series of tips leads the troopers to the remote farmhouse of an old couple, where the Pyes and Richard have taken refuge, arming themselves with the old man's firearms. An ambush by the Pyes ensues, with Pewtie and Ted ducking for cover. While Pewtie performs distinctly well under fire of the Pyes, Ted caves under the pressure of the assault. As a result, Pewtie is severely wounded and left for dead by Lamar, and watches in horror as Lamar brutally executes his helpless partner.\n\nThe Pyes escape but Pewtie survives having been unknowingly shot by Lamar with lightweight bird hunting shot. The Pyes flee to the remote house of a mentally ill young woman, Ruta Beth Tull, who has been writing confused letters to Richard about their \"mystic connection\". Tull, it later emerges, murdered her own parents as a juvenile and sees this as her link to Richard. Tull immediately takes to Lamar and the group forms into a twisted family unit as the search for them loses momentum. Pewtie returns to the house where he was ambushed to thank the owner, who also survived being kidnapped by Lamar and raised the alarm about the shootout. While at the house he is given pictures of lions drawn by Richard, and overlooked by investigators, as Richard's value to Lamar rests on his ability to draw pictures as Lamar orders him to; Lamar being amused and intrigued by the artist's ability. Pewtie also returns to his affair with his dead partner's wife Holly and frustrations at the conflicting demands of his newfound romance and his family life continue to build.\n\nLamar and his \"family\" carry out a bloody robbery of a restaurant in a small Texas town from which Lamar narrowly escapes with his life. The bloodshed of the robbery intensifies the manhunt for Lamar and Pewtie is one of the officers who drops by the scene of the crime. There he finds more pictures of lions drawn by Richard at the restaurant. He is questioned by a suspicious LT Henderson about his find but does not explain it or the earlier pictures. Lamar now reveals to his family that Richard has in fact been working on the design for a tattoo and they begin a search for a top quality tattoo artist to carry out the work and finding Jimmy Ky outside a small town. After discussing the drawings with a local art teacher Bud also begins to suspect that Lamar is working on a tattoo, and obtains information about Jimmy Ky. The stage is now set for the second bloody confrontation between Bud Pewtie and Lamar. Pewtie literally stumbles in as Lamar is being tattooed and watched over by Odell. A gunfight ensues which ends with Pewtie killing Odell in a gun battle that only ends after Bud expends all his ammunition from his 3 handguns into Odell and blasting two fingers off Lamar's left hand. Pewtie himself is once again badly injured and Lamar escapes after the intervention of Richard and Ruta.\n\nAs Bud struggles with his choices Lamar plots a terrible revenge for the death of his cousin.\n\nThe stage is set for the final confrontation between Pewtie and Lamar. Pewtie fails at first to shoot Lamar with a rifle, his bullet deflected just enough by an unseen glass door to miss his intended target and wound Ruta. The firefight leads to Lamar breaking out of a window using Holly as a shield while running across the fields towards a patch of trees with Pewtie chasing. Holly breaks away from Lamar and runs back towards the house leaving Bud to face Lamar. Bud again confirms to Holly that they are through. Lamar ambushes Bud in the patch of trees but fails to shoot him with his final bullet; the two men begin a desperate hand-to-hand struggle for Bud's gun, which the physically stronger Lamar is sure to win. As the men fight, Pewtie desperately manages to fire a shot, which hideously wounds Lamar. The fight finishes as Bud uses his back-up gun to shoot Lamar twice in the head. As the medics and SWAT teams arrive all seems to be settled, but Richard is still alive and decides he should help Lamar. He finds Bud near a creek with the just-arrived Henderson. Both of the policemen talk quietly to Richard, trying to convince him to drop his gun and telling him that they know he was not responsible for the crimes committed by the Pyes. Richard responds by firing at Bud with the gun that Lamar took from Pewtie after their first confrontation at the old couples' farmhouse.\n\nHenderson moves in front of Bud and takes the brunt of the bullet's damage, though the bullet hits Pewtie after going through Henderson. Bud is severely injured but lives as Henderson dies. The final scene is of a recovered Richard (having been shot by other policemen after firing) being transferred back to \"the Mac\" where he finds his previous fear of the prison and its brutal inmates is gone and he is a feared member of the criminal community.\n\nLamar Pye - A physically powerful, ultra-aggressive career criminal with high intelligence and considerable charisma. Lamar is depicted as the misshapen product of a violent, impoverished upbringing with the strong suggestion that under different circumstances he may have been a better man. Lamar is motivated by his contempt for the seemingly arbitrary rules of normal society, his desire to protect his retarded cousin Odell, his own love of danger and his violent tendencies.\n\nOdell Pye - A deformed and mentally disabled man, rescued from a brutally abusive parent by Lamar, who has been looking after him ever since.\n\nRichard Peed - A terrified, but artistically gifted inmate. Lamar is pleased with the art he produces, and in return for drawing more pictures, Lamar protects him from the violence and rape that is prevalent in the prison. When Lamar escapes, Richard goes with him because he knows he would be doomed without his protection.\n\nBud Pewtie - A courageous, but flawed police officer who is tasked with tracking the three escapees down. He is shot and nearly killed by Lamar, but recovers.\n\nIn 2014, Fox commissioned David Benioff and D. B. Weiss to write, direct and produce a feature film adaptation of \"Dirty White Boys.\"\n"}

Record labels competed to sign them but, when they finally ended up at Columbia Records, their single \"Gypsie Rider\" did not fare well commercially.\n\nIn 1976, they got the opportunity to become The Universal Robot Band along with underground disco producers Patrick Adams and Greg Carmichael. This project was more successful than their former projects. They made the single \"Barely Breaking Even\" alongside singer Leroy Burgess, and they also recorded an album.

The most mentionable are \"Keep Your Body Workin'\", \"Tonight's the Night\", \"Winners\", \"Intimate Connection\", and \"Get Tough\".

The family lived at Murrayfield House in west Edinburgh.\n\nAfter attending Edinburgh Academy, he proceeded to the University of St. Andrews, and thence to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he distinguished himself in classics, winning the Gaisford Greek prizes for prose (1862) and verse (1863). \nHe graduated B.A. with a first class in the final classical school in 1865.\n\nHe afterwards attended law lectures in Edinburgh, and became a member of the Juridical Society, of which he was librarian in 1872–3, and of the Speculative Society (president 1869–71). \nHe was called to the English bar (from the Inner Temple) on 10 June 1870, and on 19 July 1870 passed to the Scottish bar, where he rapidly obtained a large practice. \nThough not one of the crown counsel for Scotland, he was specially retained for the prosecution at the trial of the City of Glasgow Bank directors (January 1879), became sheriff of chancery in 1885, and procurator and cashier for the Church of Scotland in 1886.\n\nIn 1887, he was knighted, and was appointed sheriff of Renfrew and Bute in 1888 and of Perthshire in 1889. Pearson was a conservative, though not a keen politician, and in 1890 was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in Lord Salisbury's second administration, and was elected (unopposed) as Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. In the same year he became Q.C.\n\nIn 1891, he succeeded James Patrick Bannerman Robertson, as lord advocate, and was sworn of the Privy Council. At the general election of 1892, he was again returned unopposed for Edinburgh and St. Andrews Universities. After the fall of Lord Salisbury's ministry in 1892, he ceased to be lord advocate, and was chosen dean of the Faculty of Advocates. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh University in 1894, and on the return of the conservatives to power in the following year became again lord advocate, and resigned the deanship. In 1896, on the resignation of Andrew Rutherfurd-Clark, Lord Rutherfurd-Clark, he was raised to the bench, from which he retired, owing to bad health, in 1909.\n\nIn later life he lived at 7 Drumsheugh Gardens, a large Victorian townhouse in Edinburgh's West End.\n\nHe died at home in Edinburgh on 15 August 1910, and was buried in the Dean Cemetery.

It is one of the most extreme examples of the cost-cutting strategy of limited animation. The method was developed by cameraman Edwin \"Ted\" Gillette in the 1950s in order to simulate talking animals in television commercials. Gillette filed the technique on February 4, 1952, and obtained patent #2,739,505 on March 27, 1956.\n\nBecause animating a mouth in synchronization with sound was difficult, Syncro-Vox was soon used as a cheap animation technique, such as in the cartoons produced by Cambria Studios: \"Clutch Cargo\", \"Space Angel\", and \"Captain Fathom\", in which actors' lips voicing the scripted dialogue were laid over the animated figures.\n\nThe Syncro-Vox technique was short-lived in serious form. The three Cambria Studios cartoons listed above were some of the few examples of the technique being used straight, and the fourth and final Cambria Studios cartoon, The New Three Stooges, didn't use it. Although Syncro-Vox has long since fallen into disuse as a serious animation method (other than when a computerized version was used in the short-lived, and ultimately controversial, \"Mrs. Munger's Class\" shorts of the 1990s), it has survived sporadically in comedic form, most notably on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" where a celebrity's face is superimposed with live video of the moving lips of one of Conan's writers. This comedy bit was reused on Conan O'Brien's 2010 talk-show, \"Conan\" and the \"In Hot Water\" podcast on Compound Media.\n\nA spoof of Cambria Studios' Syncro-Vox cartoons called \"Mr. Incredible and Pals\" was also included as a special feature on the 2005 DVD release of \"The Incredibles\" (2004). The technique was also used in the Barenaked Ladies music video \"Thanks, That Was Fun\", which combined clips from previous videos with new mouth movements. Painty, the talking pirate painting that asks \"Are you ready, kids?\" in the introduction to \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" cartoons imitates the Syncro-Vox technique with modern animation technology. It was also featured in the episodes \"Karate Choppers\" and \"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy VI: The Motion Picture\". Syncro-Vox was used in the \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" episodes \"The Magic Tree of Nowhere\" and \"The House of Discontent\". It was also featured in some \"That '70s Show\" episodes imitating Farrah Fawcett and Richard Nixon. Syncro-Vox was again used in the December 20, 2010 episode of \"WWE Raw\". during a promo in which The Miz spoofed Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\". In 2011, Syncro-Vox was used in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Seahorse Seashell Party\". It was also used in the \"Looney Tunes\" short \"Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers\" when a Daffy Duck doppelgänger tells Bugs Bunny he accepted duck season. Syncro-Vox is used for most of the characters in \"The Annoying Orange\" (2009–), Têtes à claques, most of the characters in the toy parodies from \"The Adam and Joe Show\" and is common on \"Songify the News.\" A variation of the technique, animated mouths on actual toy action figures, is used on \"Robot Chicken\". In the first \"Star Wars\" special of the aforementioned show, the segment \"Mid-Nite with Zuckuss\" (a parody of the aforementioned \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", whose host voiced the titular character) featured an actual use of the Synchro-Vox technique on an \"interview\" with Emperor Palpatine as a means to mock the latter. Director Richard Elfman paid tribute to Syncro-Vox in a scene from his 1980 cult film The Forbidden Zone, during the scene wherein a character mimes to Machito and Miguelito Valdez' novelty dance song, \"Bim Bam Boom;\" the usage was necessary because the actor hired to lip sync the song suddenly developed stage fright and froze on-camera.\n\n"}

It is one of the three components, along with sales (both physical and the digital) and streaming activity, that determine the chart positions of songs on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nRadio airplay has always been one of the component charts of the Hot 100. Prior to the establishment of the Hot 100, \"Billboard\" published a radio airplay chart, a singles sales chart and a jukebox play chart, the last of which was discontinued in 1959 as jukeboxes lost their popularity. During the 1960s and 1970s, \"Billboard\" continued to collect airplay data as a component of the Hot 100 but did not make the chart public.\n\nThe airplay-only chart in its current form debuted as a 30-position chart on October 20, 1984. It was expanded to 40 positions on May 31, 1986, and to 75 positions on December 8, 1990.\n\nEach week, the Radio Songs chart ranks the 100 songs with the most airplay points (frequently referred to as audience impressions, which is a calculation of the number of times a song is played and the audience size of the station playing the tune). A song can pick up an airplay point every time it is selected to be played on specific radio stations that \"Billboard\" monitors. Radio stations across the board are used, from Top 40 Mainstream (which plays a wide variety of music that is generally the most popular songs of the time) to more genre-specific radio stations such as urban radio and country music. Paid plays of a song or treatment as bumper music do not count as an impression.\n\nDuring the early years of the chart, only airplay data from top 40 radio stations were compiled to generate the chart. Effective from issue dated July 17, 1993, adult contemporary stations were added to the panel, followed by modern rock few months later. However, beginning in December 1998, the chart profile expanded to include airplay data from radio stations of other formats such as R&B, rock and country. To preserve the notion of the former chart, the Top 40 Tracks chart (now defunct) was introduced at the same time.\n\nPer \"Billboard\" (as of October 2011):\n\"1,214 stations, encompassing pop, adult, rock, country, R&B/hip-hop, Christian, gospel, dance, jazz and Latin formats, are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by Nielsen Broadcast Data System.

He was an entertainer to the troops during World War II and is best known for his work on countless television, film and radio programs.\n\nHe was born Louis Neistat in Hartford, Connecticut, son of Joseph Neistat and Jennie Sherman. His sister Rose Neistat was born in 1917. Although Nye, who pronounced his given name as Louie, later claimed he was born in 1922, he is listed as age six in the 1920 Hartford County, Connecticut, Federal Census.\n\nNye's parents were both Yiddish speaking Jews from the Russian Empire. They emigrated to the United States in 1906, and became naturalized citizens in 1911. His father owned a small grocery store, which his wife helped him run. Louis Nye attended Weaver High School, but he was not a good student. \"My marks were so low,\" he explained, \"that they wouldn't let me in the drama club. So I went down to WTIC Radio, auditioned, and got on a show.\"\n\nNye decided to go to New York City, where he worked in radio, playing various roles on soap operas. He recalled \"I still think of myself as an actor. In the radio days, I was busy playing rotten Nazis, rich uncles and emotional juveniles -- the whole span -- and the only time I tried to be funny was at parties.\"\n\nNye served in the United States Army during World War II, and because he earned laughs by mimicking other soldiers, he was assigned to run the recreation hall. Following his discharge, he returned to New York and began working in live television. He also appeared in several plays on Broadway, and made many appearances on television variety shows such as \"The Jack Benny Program\" (including one memorable turn as a crying cab driver), \"The Jimmy Durante Show\", \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom\" and \"The Victor Borge Show\".\n\nHe earned his greatest fame as a regular on \"The Steve Allen Show\", performing with Allen, Don Knotts, Tom Poston, Pat Harrington Jr., Dayton Allen, Gabriel Dell and Bill Dana. He primarily played urbane, wealthy, and often fey bon vivants; as part of the weekly \"Man on the Street\" sketches, his characterization of the pretentious country-club braggart Gordon Hathaway, with his catchphrase, \"Hi-ho, Steverino,\" plus Allen's inability to resist bursting into hysterical laughter at his ad-libs, made Nye one of the favorites on Allen's show. When production moved to Los Angeles, Nye went too and became a character actor in Hollywood.\n\nNye was cast as a guest star on many television series, including \"Make Room for Daddy\"; \"Guestward, Ho!\"; \"Burke's Law\"; \"The Munsters\"; \"Love, American Style\"; \"Laverne & Shirley\"; \"Starsky and Hutch\"; \"Police Woman\"; \"Fantasy Island\"; \"St. Elsewhere\"; and \"The Cosby Show\".\n\nNye played dentist Delbert Gray on several episodes of \"The Ann Sothern Show\" from 1960 to 1961, the romantic interest of Olive Smith, played by Ann Tyrrell (1909–1983). Nye also played Sonny Drysdale, the spoiled rich stepson of Milburn Drysdale on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" during the 1962 season. He did six episodes, and received more mail than from anything else he had ever done on television, but the character was dropped. It was rumored that someone in the CBS network, or a sponsor, thought Sonny was too \"sissified\". However, Nye revived the character briefly during the 1966 season.\nDuring this period, Nye appeared in several television commercials for various products, including Rath brand lunch meats and the Better Business Bureau.\n\nNye was a member of the cast of the \"Needles and Pins\", playing Harry Karp. The sitcom, which starred Norman Fell, ran for 14 episodes in the autumn of 1973.\n\nNye appeared as a celebrity judge on \"The Gong Show\" during the late 1970s. He also recorded a few comedy LPs, doing a variety of characterizations. Unfortunately, he never had the opportunity to reach his potential in movies. Many of his character roles were little more than cameos. Nevertheless, he performed with Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, Dean Martin, Walter Matthau, Robert Mitchum, Jack Webb and Joanne Woodward, and others. Nye also appeared on the lecture circuit, in concerts and in nightclubs, and did voice work in animation, such as \"Inspector Gadget\" with Don Adams.\n\nNye never retired. He completed a 24-city tour of the country for Columbia Artists, ending the tour with a two-week stint at the Sahara in Las Vegas. At age 92, he continued to work, appearing in his recurring role of Jeff Greene's father on HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" from 2000 to 2005.\n\nNye lived in Pacific Palisades, California with his wife, pianist-songwriter Anita Leonard, who wrote the standard, \"A Sunday Kind of Love.\" Married since the late 1940s, they had a son, artist Peter Nye. Nye was also the great uncle of filmmakers Casey Neistat and Van Neistat and stuntman Dean Neistat.\n\nLouis Nye died of lung cancer. He was cremated and is remains are interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954432", "title": "Westies", "text": "Westies\n\nThe Westies were a New York City-based Irish American organized crime gang, responsible for racketeering, drug trafficking, and contract killing. They were partnered with the Italian-American Mafia and operated out of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. \n\nAccording to crime author T.J. English, \"Although never more than twelve to twenty members—depending on who was in or out of jail at any given time— \nthe Westies became synonymous with the last generation of Irish in the birthplace of the Irish Mob.\" According to the NYPD Organized Crime Squad and the FBI, the Westies were responsible for 60–100 murders between 1968 and 1986.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mickey Spillane stepped into a power vacuum that had existed in Hell's Kitchen since gang leaders fled the area in the early 1950s to avoid prosecution. A mobster from Queens, named Hughie Mulligan, had been running Hell's Kitchen; Spillane, a native, was his apprentice until assuming leadership. \n\nSpillane sent flowers to neighbors in the hospital and provided turkeys to needy families during Thanksgiving, in addition to running gambling enterprises such as bookmaking and policy, accompanied inevitably by loansharking. Loansharking led to assault, and Spillane had burglary arrests as well. However, among all his criminal activities, the most audacious was his \"snatch\" racket (kidnapping and holding local businessmen and members of other crime organizations for ransom).\n\nHe was able to add to his neighborhood prominence by marrying Maureen McManus, a daughter of the prestigious McManus family which had run the Midtown Democratic Club since 1905. The union of political power with criminal activity enhanced the gang's ability to control union jobs and labor racketeering, moving away from the declining waterfront and more strongly into construction jobs and service work at the New York Coliseum, Madison Square Garden, and later the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Irish mob saw an increased threat from the Italian Mafia as the Genovese crime family sought control over the soon to be built Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Since the convention center was located in Spillane's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Spillane refused to allow any involvement by the Italians. Although the Italian gangsters greatly outnumbered the Irish mob, Spillane was successful in keeping control of the convention center and Hell's Kitchen. The Italians, frustrated and embarrassed, responded by hiring a rogue Irish-American hitman named Joseph \"Mad Dog\" Sullivan to assassinate Tom Devaney, Eddie \"the Butcher\" Cummiskey, and Tom \"the Greek\" Kapatos, three of Spillane's top lieutenants.\n\nIn 1977, Spillane was assassinated by Roy DeMeo in a hit set up by Jimmy Coonan, who wanted to take over from Spillane. Coonan recruited the infamous DeMeo after a deal was struck between the two. By rubbing out Spillane, DeMeo's crew would then do business with his successor. DeMeo initially came into contact with Coonan after the latter had murdered and dismembered loan shark Ruby Stein. \n\nThe war began when an 18-year old Coonan swore revenge against Spillane, following the Spillane-initiated kidnapping and pistol whipping of Coonan's father. In 1966, Coonan fired a machine gun at Spillane and his associates from atop a Hell's Kitchen tenement building. Although Coonan wounded no one, Spillane understood that the younger hoodlum was not to be taken lightly. Spillane went to Coonan's father, slapped him around and told him to get his son under control. Coonan was imprisoned for a short period for murder and kidnapping charges that were pleaded down to Class C Manslaughter. He was released in late 1971 and continued his war with the Westside Gang.\n\nHell's Kitchen was no longer safe for Spillane and his family, and he moved to the then-Irish working-class neighborhood of Woodside, Queens. With Spillane gone, his control of the rackets in Hell's Kitchen began to deteriorate; Coonan became the neighborhood's boss, although some still viewed Spillane as boss. On the New York Commission, Spillane was still viewed as the Irish Mob boss on the Westside, putting the Javits Convention Center construction site under his control. Anthony Salerno, a high-ranking member of the Genovese crime family, wanted the center for himself and reached an agreement with Jimmy Coonan. If Coonan became boss, Salerno would run the construction site and give Coonan a taste of the proceeds.\n\nSalerno then reached out to Buffalo Crime Family associate and freelance hitman, Joseph Sullivan, to eliminate the three main Spillane supporters in Hell's Kitchen, Tom Devaney, Tom Kapatos, and Edward Cummiskey. Cummiskey had apparently switched sides to the Coonan camp after they both killed and dismembered Patrick \"Paddy\" Dugan for killing Cummiskey's best friend, but Salerno and Sullivan were not aware of the switch. Devaney and Cummiskey were killed in late 1976, and Kapatos was killed in January 1977. Spillane was out of the picture, and Coonan was the undisputed boss of Hell's Kitchen. It was felt that Spillane still had to die. Roy DeMeo, a Gambino crime family soldier, murdered Spillane as a favor to Coonan. Mickey Featherstone stood trial for the murder and was found not guilty.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Coonan tightened the alliance between the Westies and the Gambinos, then run by Paul Castellano. Coonan's main contact was Roy DeMeo. In 1979 both Coonan and Featherstone were acquitted of the murder of a bartender, Harold Whitehead. Another Westie (and top enforcer), James McElroy, was acquitted of the murder of a Teamster in 1980.\n\nAlthough both Westies leaders were imprisoned in 1980 — Coonan on gun possession charges, Featherstone on a federal counterfeiting rap — the gambling, loansharking, and union shakedowns continued on the West Side. After DeMeo himself was murdered, Coonan's Gambino connection became Danny Marino, a capo from Brooklyn. Coonan eventually interacted directly with John Gotti, who took over the Gambinos after Castellano's murder in December 1985. Gotti appointed Joe Watts as the liaison to the Westies. From time to time, the Westies worked for the Gambinos as a contract killer squad.\n\nFeatherstone was convicted of murder in early 1986 and began cooperating with the government in hopes of getting the conviction overturned, and because he believed the rest of the Westies had framed him for the murder. The information he and his wife Sissy provided, and the recordings they helped make, achieved this aim. In September 1986 the prosecutor who oversaw Featherstone's conviction told the presiding judge that post-conviction investigation had revealed that Featherstone was innocent. The judge overturned the verdict. At that point the information provided by the Featherstones resulted in the arrest of Coonan and several other Westies on state charges of murder and other crimes.\n\nShortly afterward, federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani announced a devastating RICO indictment against Coonan and others for criminal activities going back twenty years. Featherstone testified in open court for four weeks in the trial that began in September 1987 and concluded with major convictions in 1988. Coonan was sentenced to sixty years in prison on assorted charges. Other leading gang members were also sentenced to long prison terms, including McElroy, who was sentenced to 60 years, and Richard \"Mugsy\" Ritter, a career criminal sentenced to 40 years on loan-sharking and drug related charges.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the old demographic of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood was disappearing. The blue-collar Irish-American community was being displaced by a more affluent and ethnically diverse group of residents. With this change came a decrease in street crime and a change in leadership. Bosko Radonjich, an American-Serbian nationalist and onetime anti-communist started his Westies affiliation as a low-level associate of Jimmy Coonan in 1983. He became the boss of the Westies when Kelly went on the lam and was instrumental in the \"fixing\" of John Gotti's 1986 racketeering trial.\n\nAround 1992, Radonjich fled the country to avoid jury tampering charges. He was eventually arrested by U.S. Customs officials during a stopover in Miami, Florida, in 1999. However, Radonjich was released when the main witness in the case, Sammy Gravano, was deemed unreliable. Radonjich returned to his native Serbia where he operated a casino and nightclub until he died in 2011 from poor health In 1992, a man named Brian Bentley was identified as a member of the Westies and was implicated in a burglary ring responsible for victimizing over 1,000 businesses throughout Manhattan. When Michael G. Cherkasky, chief of the Investigations Division of the District Attorney's Office, was asked how much still remained of the Westies, he said: \"Too much,\" and that \"it's not the end\" of the gang.\"\n\n"}

In particular, it features a hierarchy of source repositories, and allows atomic updates of multiple files, features found in later version-control systems such as Subversion and Perforce. TeamWare allows distributed development by copying a repository to another which might reside on another machine or network.

Pacemakers are frequently employed by race organisers for world record attempts with specific instructions for lap times. Some athletes have essentially become professional pacemakers. A competitor who chooses the tactic of leading in order to win is called a front-runner rather than a pacemaker.\n\nPacemakers may be used to avoid the tactics of deception that are possible in competition by those who, for example, race away from the start line (and are likely to subsequently slow down), giving the other runners the impression that they are far behind. A trusted team of pacemakers who are paid to keep the runners at a speed that they can manage for the rest of the race become useful in such a situation. Pacemakers are also used on world record attempts in order to make sure that the runner knows where their invisible 'opponent' predecessor is at that stage of the race. Pacemakers serve the role of conveying tangible information about pacing on the track during a race. Pacemakers may also facilitate drafting.\n\nPacemaking gained much usage after Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway successfully paced Roger Bannister to break the four-minute mile for the first time in 1954.\n\nPurists argue that employing pacemakers detracts from the competitive nature of racing. Original rules frowned on a competitor who was not actively trying to win, and pacemakers were required to finish a race for any record to count. This rule has now been dropped, though the pacemaker must still start with the other athletes in the race as a registered entrant. A lapped competitor may not act as a pacemaker.\n\nThe 1500 metres at the Bislett Games in 1981 became part of track folklore when star athletes including Steve Ovett chose not to follow pacemaker Tom Byers but race among themselves. Ovett's last lap was almost 10 seconds faster than Byers's, but Byers held on to win by a few metres. A similar case occurred in the 1994 Los Angeles Marathon when veteran marathoner Paul Pilkington was paid to set a fast pace then drop out. When the elite athletes failed to follow his pace, he kept going, ultimately winning $27,000 and a new Mercedes to the surprise of the expected favourites. That year, the L.A. Marathon was the National Championship race, so he also became the United States National Champion. Brazilian Vanderlei De Lima, later the marathon bronze medalist in the 2004 Summer Olympics, was a pacemaker at the Reims Marathon in 1994. It was his first competitive marathon, and he was supposed to be a pacemaker up to the 21 km point, but won the race.\n\nDuring the Berlin Marathon in 2000, Simon Biwott was hired as a pacemaker, but crossed the finish line as the winner.\n\nThe rules for pacemakers state, three of them at most are dedicated to one group of runners.\n\nIn the 2003 Berlin Marathon, Paul Tergat (Kenya) set a new world record with 2:04:55. In the run, the pacemaker Sammy Korir finished 1 second behind in second place. At 21.5 miles into the run, Korir tried to make a move on Tergat which came out unsuccessfully.\n\nPacemakers are also used in horse racing, where in \"classic\" distance races (over one mile, or eight furlongs) horses who are better at sprint distances (roughly 5-6 1/2 furlongs) may be entered into major races specifically to set the pace for the top horses from the same stable. On a few occasions, pacemakers have finished ahead of the horses they were setting the pace for, such as when Summoner won the 2001 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and At First Sight running second in the 2010 Epsom Derby ahead of his two more-favoured stablemates.\n\n"}

He moved to Southport, Lancashire, with his family in 1929, and worked with his father as a builder. He joined an amateur dramatic society, and in a local production there met Mabel Cecilia Myerscough (1906–1989), all of whose family had been connected with the stage.\n\nHe remained a proud Yorkshireman, and having been selected by the BBC as an announcer for its North Regional radio service, he went on to be an occasional newsreader on the BBC Home Service during the Second World War. He was the first newsreader to speak in a regional accent rather than Received Pronunciation, \"a deliberate attempt to make it more difficult for Nazis to impersonate BBC broadcasters\", and caused some comment by wishing his fellow northerners \"Good neet\".\n\nHis first professional appearance was as an extra in Henry Baynton's production of \"Julius Caesar\" at the Theatre Royal in Halifax in the 1920s. Pickles soon became a radio celebrity, and pursued an acting career in London's West End theatre, on television and on film.\n\nHis most significant work was as host of the BBC Radio show \"Have A Go\", which ran from 1946 to 1967 and launched such catchphrases as \"How do, how are yer?\", \"Are yer courting?\", \"What's on the table, Mabel?\" and \"Give him the money, Barney\". He appeared in the show with his wife Mabel, whom he had married at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, Ainsdale, Southport on 20 September 1930.\n\nThe series attracted a weekly audience of over 20 million and a mailbag of around 5,000 letters. Contestants could earn £1/19s/11d by sharing \"their intimate secrets\". In May 1954, he took the show to television with the programme \"Ask Pickles\" which ran until 1956. The show was publicized enthusiastically by the BBC:\nIn 1948, a children's board game entitled \"Ask Pickles\" was published by jigsaw puzzle manufacturer Tower Press.\n\nHe was the guest castaway on BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\" on 2 January 1953; his chosen book was \"The Oxford Book of English Verse\" edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch, and his luxury a yellow waistcoat.\n\nOn television, among many performances, he appeared in \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook\" and \"For the Love of Ada\", co-starring with Irene Handl.\n\nHe was in the play \"Come Laughing Home\" by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall on BBC Radio 4 in 1970. In 1971, he was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\".\n\nIn 1955, Wilfred Pickles published an anthology of poetry and prose of the \"north counties\" of England. The book, \"My North Countrie\", featured verses from a range of poets and writers including two Lancashire dialect verses, \"A Bird Song Away\" and \"Th' Art Lookin' Sackless\", from the award-winning weaver-poet Nicholas Freeston.\n\nIn 1950, he was awarded the OBE for services to broadcasting.\n\nIn 1955, he opened the Wilfred Pickles' School for Spastics at Tixover Grange, Rutland. Also in 1955, he and wife Mabel celebrated their silver wedding anniversary by returning to the Sacred Heart Church in Southport, when they gave money for a statue of Saint Teresa Margaret of the Sacred Heart, which still stands in the church. They recorded an edition of \"Have a Go\" from the church hall (now demolished), and later performed a version of the show in the adjacent school for the children.\n\nHe appeared, to great credit and dramatic effect, in the film of \"Billy Liar\", starring Tom Courtenay - as his son.\n\nPickles died in Brighton on 27 March 1978, aged 73, and is buried with his wife Mabel in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.\n\nWilfred Pickles was the uncle of judge James Pickles, actors Vivian Pickles and Christina Pickles, and great-uncle of actor Carolyn Pickles.\n\nThe now-defunct \"Portman & Pickles\" public house in Market Street, Halifax, was named after him and film actor Eric Portman.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Entercom, its studios are located at Two Prudential Plaza in the Chicago Loop, while the station transmitter—diplexed with sister station WSCR—resides in the nearby suburb of Bloomingdale. \n\nWBBM is a Class A station that broadcasts on a clear-channel AM frequency, powered with 35,000 watts by day and 42,000 watts at night, using a non-directional antenna. Its daytime signal provides at least grade B coverage to most of the northern two-thirds of Illinois (as far south as Springfield) as well as large portions of Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Indiana. Its city-grade coverage reaches as far north as Milwaukee. At night, WBBM can be heard across much of North America with a good radio, but is strongest in the Midwest.\n\nIn addition to a standard analog transmission, WBBM broadcasts over HD Radio using the in-band on-channel standard, is simulcast over WCFS-FM (105.9), and is available online via Radio.com.\n\nThe most-common \"program\" on WBBM is a live rolling \"news wheel\" that begins at the top of each hour, structured into segments of news, traffic, weather, sports, and business updates from Bloomberg Radio. The scheduling of these segments is similar to that of several co-owned all-news stations including WCBS in New York City, KNX in Los Angeles, KCBS in San Francisco and WWJ in Detroit. This news wheel can be interrupted for breaking local or national news events that necessitate longer-form coverage.\n\nOther programs featured on WBBM include: \"Noon Business Hour\", hosted by Cisco Cotto and Kris Kridel; \"At Issue\", public affairs interviews with Craig Dellimore; \"CBS News Weekend Roundup\"; old-time radio program \"When Radio Was\"; audio portions of \"60 Minutes\" and \"Face the Nation\"; and live broadcasts of all 22 games that involve the Chicago Bears football team from August to January.\n\nWBBM also broadcasts 60 second light segments throughout the day, such as \"Real Estate Feature\", \"Made In Chicago\", \"Innovation Minute\", \"Eating Right\", among others. These segments are also available as podcasts. Current on-air staff includes: Pat Cassidy, Felicia Middlebrooks, Cisco Cotto, Keith Johnson, Nick Young, and Rob Hart.\n\nWBBM was first licensed on January 31, 1924 to the Frank Atlass Produce Company at 110 Park Place in Lincoln, Illinois. The station's primary founder, 29-year-old Harry Leslie \"Les\" Atlass, had extensive earlier radio experience. In 1911, he had reportedly constructed a simple spark transmitter set. Three years later his then 11-year-old younger brother, Ralph, constructed an apparently unlicensed amateur radio station at the family home, that was described as \"chief wireless station\" of the newly-formed Lincoln United Wireless Association. \n\nWith the April 1917 entrance of the United States into World War I the federal government took full control of the radio industry, and it became illegal for civilians to operate radio transmitters and receivers. After the conclusion of the war the civilian radio restrictions were lifted. Les Atlass' continuing interest in radio led in mid-1923 to his obtaining a license to operate an amateur radio station, 9DFC.\n\nAlthough the original spark radio transmitters were only capable of producing the dots-and-dashes of Morse code, the development of vacuum tube transmitters made audio transmissions practical. In the early 1920s this led to the introduction of organized broadcasting, and by the end of 1922 over 500 broadcast stations were operating in the United States. Amateur radio stations were not permitted to make broadcasts intended for the general public. However, during April 1923 Les Atlass, in conjunction with the \"Lincoln Courier\" newspaper, broadcast local election results over 9DFC, claiming as a technicality that instead of a prohibited public broadcast, he was merely transmitting information to a second amateur, which by chance (and through newspaper publicity) others might overhear.\n\nA few months later Atlass procured a proper broadcasting station license with the call sign WBBM, which made its debut on the evening of February 6, 1924, transmitting on 1330 kHz. The station's call letters had been randomly assigned from an alphabetic list maintained by the Department of Commerce, and during the inaugural broadcast Atlass adopted a representative slogan of \"We Broadcast Better Music\". Over the years, additional slogans would include \"We Broadcast Broadmoor Music,\" \"World's Best Broadcast Medium,\" and \"Where Better Broadcasts Materialize\".\n\nWBBM's time in Lincoln was brief. In mid-February 1924, it was announced that the Frank Atlass Produce Company, the family business where Les Atlass was president, had been sold, and he was preparing to move to Chicago. The last reported broadcast in Lincoln occurred on April 14th, after which the station was dismantled, and its equipment shipped to Les Atlass' newly purchased Chicago home. The station was officially deleted a few months later.\n\nShortly after moving to Chicago, Les Atlass returned to the airwaves, and received a new license for a broadcasting station operated from his home at 7421 Sheridan Road, again with the call letters WBBM and transmitting on 1330 kHz, now with himself as the licensee.\n\nIn 1925, station ownership was transferred to the Atlass Investment Company, with the station located at 1554 Howard Street, now transmitting with 1,500 watts. On June 4, 1925, studios and transmitter were moved to the Broadmoor Hotel in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood. \"95.99%\" of the station's programming was devoted to music during this period, including live musical broadcasts aired from a small studio in the lobby of the hotel. In 1926, the Stewart-Warner corporation leased the station's full schedule, and began producing all of its programming.\n\nOn June 15, 1927 WBBM moved to 770 kHz with 1,000 watts, sharing time with Chicago stations WAAF (now WNTD) and WJBT. Later in the year power was increased to 5,000 watts. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of General Order 40, the Federal Radio Commission reallocated frequencies on the AM broadcasting band. WAAF was reassigned to 920 kHz, while WBBM and WJBT remained at 770 kHz, with the frequency now designated a \"clear channel\" assignment. WJBT's license was acquired by the Atlass Investment Company, and the two stations were consolidated as WBBM-WJBT, although the latter call sign was rarely, if ever, used. Its transmitter was moved to Glenview, Illinois, and its studios were moved to the Wrigley Building. Powers for clear channel stations could potentially be up to 50,000 watts, and WBBM's was increased to 10,000 watts in 1928 and 25,000 watts the following year.\n\nThe station began a long association with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) on September 27, 1928, when it joined as Chicago's second network affiliate. WMAQ (now WSCR) had joined the network at its launch one year earlier. CBS bought a controlling interest in WBBM in 1929, and in 1931 it purchased the remaining station stock. Les Atlass remained at the station, while Ralph left and purchased station WLAP, then in Louisville. \n\nOn May 15, 1933, the station discontinued the WJBT dual call letter usage and reverted to just WBBM, after the Federal Radio Commission requested that stations using only one of their assigned call letters drop those that were no longer in regular use.\n\nAs part of the November 11, 1928, AM band reorganization, KFAB in Lincoln, Nebraska, had also been assigned to transmit on 770 kHz. WBBM and KFAB were far enough apart to allow concurrent operation during the daytime, but their longer range nighttime signals required coordination to avoid mutual interference. Initially the stations established a timesharing agreement for nighttime hours. However, in early 1932 KFAB switched network affiliation from the NBC Red Network to CBS. With much of their evening programming the same, the two stations establishing simultaneous \"synchronized\" broadcasting of their common network programming. The synchronized operation began on January 27, 1934.\n\nWBBM's power was increased to 50,000 watts in 1935. In March 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), both WBBM and KFAB were shifted to 780 kHz. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the resulting U.S. entry into World War II, there was an increase in air traffic at Naval Air Station Glenview. The Navy asked WBBM to move its towers to a new location. As a result, the station's towers and transmitter were moved to Itasca, Illinois, on May 1, 1942. During World War II, much of WBBM's programming was devoted to the war effort.\n\nIn 1948, KFAB was relocated to Omaha, and was also reassigned to 1110 kHz, freeing up WBBM to begin operating fulltime on 780 kHz, ending the nighttime synchronized broadcasts. In 1956, WBBM's studios were moved to North McClurg Court, with the rest of CBS' Chicago operations, where it remained until moving to Two Prudential Plaza in 2006. Les Atlass held various senior level management positions with WBBM and CBS until his retirement November 29, 1959 on his 65th birthday. He died the next year.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to television, WBBM maintained a personality-based middle of the road (MOR) format until 1964. At that point, it eliminated music and switched to a news/talk format. WBBM adopted its current all-news format in May 1968 (after co-owned WCBS New York City switched to all news in 1967 and KNX Los Angeles made the change in Spring of 1968). The station has been the flagship station of the Chicago Bears since 2000, and in its history has also aired Chicago White Sox baseball games and Chicago Blackhawks hockey games.\n\nOver the years, WBBM fended off competition from other all-news stations that were attempted in the Chicago radio market: McLendon-owned WNUS-AM-FM (1390 AM, now WGRB and 107.5 FM, now WGCI-FM), NBC's WNIS-FM (now WKQX) and Group W's WMAQ (now WSCR), which came under the CBS umbrella when Westinghouse Electric Corporation purchased CBS in 1995. \n\nFrom the 1950s through the 90s, WBBM had been in a spirited battle with rival news/talk/sports station WGN for the position of the #1 radio station in the Chicago market. In the June 2009 ratings period, as estimated by Arbitron, WGN held a slight edge over WBBM in PPM-metered listener ratings. However, since the fall of 2009, WBBM has maintained a lead while WGN's listenership began to decline. \n\nAnother challenge to WBBM's news radio domination came from Merlin Media, operated by former Tribune Company executive Randy Michaels. Michaels purchased FM station WKQX (the successor to WNIS-FM) in June 2011 with plans to switch formats to all-news as \"FM News 101.1\", but in a preemptive move, CBS Radio launched a simulcast of WBBM over WCFS-FM that August 1. Previously, WBBM had been simulcast over WCFS's HD2 subchannel. \n\nThe FM station's call letters were retained and should not be confused with WBBM-FM; WCFS-FM's former adult contemporary format moved to the HD2 channel, effectively switching signals with WBBM's audio. \n\nOn June 5, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that the flagship station for their radio broadcasts would be moved from WGN to WBBM for the 2015 season under a seven-year deal. The switch to WBBM ended the team's 90-year association with WGN; that station had broadcast Cubs games from its establishment in 1924, became its exclusive broadcaster in 1958, and was co-owned with the Cubs by Tribune Company from 1981 to 2009. \n\nCubs games were only broadcast on WBBM's AM feed; while the games were being played, WCFS-FM continued to broadcast WBBM's regular all-news programming uninterrupted. \n\nThe arrangement lasted only one season; after co-owned sports radio station WSCR lost the White Sox to WLS for the 2016 season, an option was invoked which moved the Cubs to WSCR, giving the sports station another Chicago baseball team. Interestingly, WLS only aired White Sox games for one season, in 2017, the White Sox relocated to WGN. \n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States. The sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust to avoid a tax liability. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating the WBBM radio stations (both 780 and FM 96.3) plus WCFS-FM from Channel 2 WBBM-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. \n\nDespite the ownership change, WBBM radio and WBBM-TV maintain a partnership, with WBBM radio making use of some WBBM-TV local news and weather reporting. On March 1, 2018, Entercom launched a new website for WBBM alone on the company's Radio.com portal, breaking it off from the former CBS Chicago portal.\n\nShortly after the move of the transmitter to the WSCR site, WBBM adjusted its news wheel for some segments for the first time in decades, presumably due to lengthening traffic reports and the adjustment of some ad breaks. The sports news segment moved to :16/:46, with business news coverage moving to :23/:53 past the hour, and hourly feature segments moving to :21 past the hour.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a major effect on the station's daily operations, with only three people at a time in the station's newsroom and most of the station's anchors and news writers working from home. Traffic reports were temporarily reduced, the station's sportscasts were reduced, and some airshifts, mainly overnights, do not feature traffic reports, with some news hours pre-recorded with only reference to the minutes rather than anchors being live, though breaking news in overnight hours is still covered live.\n\nIn 2018, WBBM was granted an FCC construction permit to move its transmitter to WSCR's tower site in Bloomingdale. That allowed Entercom to sell the Itasca transmitter site to commercial and residential land developers. \n\nWBBM's power was reduced to 35,000 watts during the day and 42,000 watts at night, from the previous 50,000 watt signal it had maintained since 1935. Entercom engineers say the reduction in transmitting power will not be apparent to most listeners, except in some fringe areas. The move was completed on July 18, 2019, with the previous transmitter in Itasca, Illinois, coming down shortly thereafter. Despite the reduction in power, WBBM is still considered a Class A station broadcasting on a clear channel frequency.\n\n"}

The album is notable for its experimental and heavy use of digital samplers which were not commonly used until the mid-to-late 1980s, resulting in a more minimalist sound compared to their previous work.\n\nIt is considered the first released album to feature mostly samples and loops, influencing the heavy use of sampling and looping in popular music. Yellow Magic Orchestra's approach to sampling music was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.\n\nIn 2016, the Canadian post-punk group Preoccupations covered the track \"Key\" as a part of a 7\" vinyl that came with pre-orders of their self-titled album alongside a cover of The Raincoats' 1979 track \"Off-Duty Trip\".\n\nMost of the sampling was made with an , a custom-built digital sampler developed by Toshiba-EMI engineer Kenji Murata. The LMD-649 was the first PCM digital sampler, capable of playing and recording PCM samples with a 12-bit audio depth and 50 kHz sampling rate, stored in 128 KB of dynamic RAM memory. It also had sampling drum machine capabilities. Notable samples used include Indonesian kecak chanting (\"Neue Tanz\"), gamelan and short looped vocals (\"paa\", \"fuku\", \"chiki\") for percussion in \"Seoul Music\", and the final two tracks feature factory noises. The LMD-649 was later used by other Japanese synthpop artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as and Logic System in 1982.\n\nThe album also features use of speech through a two-way radio, a prepared piano, a Roland TR-808 drum machine (previously used in \"BGM\"), and Prophet-5 synthesizers. In another departure from previous albums, Haruomi Hosono has a more prominent role playing the bass guitar as opposed to playing bass lines on synthesizers (this trend appears again on the album \"Service\").\n\nAs with many of YMO's releases, song titles are printed in both Japanese and English. For \"Seoul Music\", the kanji \"京城\" are used, referring to Gyeongseong (경성; known as Keijou in Japan), the name of Seoul when Korea was under Japanese rule. \"灯\" refers to the light of a lantern. \"Neue Tanz\" is German for \"New Dance\", while \"Taisō\" is Japanese for \"gymnastics\" or \"calisthenics\".\n\nYellow Magic Orchestra – Arrangements, Electronics, Sampler, Mixing engineers, Producers\n\nGuest musicians\n\nStaff\n"}

General James Murray (1721-1794) was his younger brother; as was Alexander Murray, who gained some notoriety as a Jacobite, not least during the 1750 by-election in Westminster. He was uncle of Major Patrick Ferguson killed at the Battle of King's Mountain in 1780.\n\nAlthough admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1722, he soon turned from legal to military pursuits, becoming an ensign in the army, and subsequently major in Ponsonby's foot and lieutenant-colonel in Wynyard's marines. \nWith the latter regiment he served at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1740.\n\nAfter the failure of that expedition Murray quit the army. \nHe had married in 1735, and had succeeded his father as Lord Elibank the next year. Returning to Scotland, he associated chiefly with the members of the legal profession, among whom he had been brought up, and seems to have been very popular ; but his chief interests were literary. \nHe was long in intimate relations with Lord Kames and David Hume, and the three were regarded in Edinburgh as a committee of taste in literary matters, from whose judgment there was no appeal. \nHe was the early patron of Dr. Robertson, and of John Home the tragic poet, both of whom were at one time ministers of country parishes near his seat in East Lothian.\n\nUpon the accession of George III, Elibank, like many other Jacobites, rallied to the house of Hanover ; and when Lord Bute came into power it was determined to bring him into the House of Lords. \nThis plan was, however, foiled by a severely sarcastic article by Wilkes in the \"North Briton\" on his presumed services to the Pretender. \nWilkes had been an unsuccessful candidate for the governorship of Canada when that office was conferred on Elibank's brother, General James Murray.\n\nWhen in Scotland in 1773, Dr. Johnson paid Elibank a visit at his house of Ballencrieff Castle, Haddingtonshire. He was member of the Cocoa Tree Club and The Poker Club.\n\nHis Edinburgh address in his final years is given as James Court on the Lawnmarket.\n\nElibank died at Ballencrieff on 3 August 1778.\n\nHe was married in 1735 to Maria Margaretta, daughter of Cornelis de Jonge van Ellemeet, receiver-general of the United Provinces, and widow of William North, 6th Baron North; but there was no issue of the marriage. \nLady Elibank's jointure-house was Kirtling Park, Cambridgeshire, the ancient seat of the North family, now pulled down, and there she and Elibank often resided. \nShe died in 1762.\n\nElibank's works were : \n\n"}
{"id": "1954484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954484", "title": "The Cat's Meow", "text": "The Cat's Meow\n\nThe Cat's Meow is a 2001 historical drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and starring Kirsten Dunst, Eddie Izzard, Edward Herrmann, Cary Elwes, Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly. The screenplay by Steven Peros is based on his play of the same title, which was inspired by the mysterious death of film mogul Thomas H. Ince that occurred on William Randolph Hearst's yacht during a weekend cruise celebrating Ince's birthday in November 1924. Among those in attendance were Hearst's longtime companion and film actress Marion Davies, fellow actor Charlie Chaplin, writer Elinor Glyn, columnist Louella Parsons, and actress Margaret Livingston. The film provides a speculative assessment on the unclear manner of Ince's death.\n\nAn international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, \"The Cat's Meow\" was primarily shot in Greece, which served as a stand-in for coastal Southern California. The film premiered at the Locarno International Film Festival in 2001, and was released theatrically in the United States by Lionsgate in April 2002. It grossed $3.6 million worldwide, and received largely favorable reviews from film critics.\n\nOn November 15, 1924, various individuals board the luxury yacht \"Oneida\" in San Pedro, California, including its owner, publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, and his mistress, silent film star Marion Davies; motion picture mogul Thomas H. Ince, whose birthday is the reason for the weekend cruise, and his mistress, starlet Margaret Livingston (who would portray \"the Woman From the City\" in F.W. Murnau's \"\" three years later); international film star Charlie Chaplin; English writer Elinor Glyn; and Louella Parsons, a film critic for Hearst's \"New York American\".\n\nSeveral of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of \"A Woman of Paris\" and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old Lita Grey (who appeared in his film \"The Kid\"), is in the midst of preparing \"The Gold Rush\". Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in Cosmopolitan Pictures. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.\n\nHearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.\n\nArmed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn. Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin. She states \"I never loved him\" just as Hearst arrives behind them. Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince. The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.\n\nHearst arranges to dock in San Diego and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted suicide when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's ulcer flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the Hearst Corporation, thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.\n\nAfter seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.\n\nThe film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them:\n\nTom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death. Very few newspapers reported it, no police action was taken, and of all the people on board only one was ever questioned. It is concluded that in Hollywood, \"the place just off the coast of the planet Earth,\" no two accounts of the story are the same.\n\nFilm scholar Jonathan Rosenbaum, editor of the 1992 book \"This is Orson Welles\" — a record of interviews Peter Bogdanovich conducted with Orson Welles — began his April 2002 review of \"The Cat's Meow\" with this exchange about \"Citizen Kane\" (1941):\n\nOW: In the original script we had a scene based on a notorious thing Hearst had done, which I still cannot repeat for publication. And I cut it out because I thought it hurt the film and wasn’t in keeping with Kane’s character. If I’d kept it in, I would have had no trouble with Hearst. He wouldn’t have dared admit it was him.<br>PB: Did you shoot the scene?<br>OW: No, I didn’t. I decided against it. If I’d kept it in, I would have bought silence for myself forever.\n\n\"The incident Welles alluded to in this exchange is the subject of \"The Cat’s Meow\", directed by Bogdanovich and adapted by Steven Peros from his own play,\" Rosenbaum wrote. \"Bogdanovich may see Welles as the inspiration for his film, but I have no idea where Peros got his facts.\"\n\nRosenbaum did find a similar story in the 1979 edition of \"The Film Encyclopedia\" by Ephraim Katz, in the entry on Thomas Ince; and in the 1971 essay on \"Citizen Kane\" by Pauline Kael:\n\nHer principal source was John Houseman, script supervisor for cowriter Herman Mankiewicz, and it seems safe to conclude, even without her prodding, that some version of the story must have cropped up in Mankiewicz’s first draft of the script, which Welles subsequently edited and added to. According to Kael, the only trace of the subplot left in the script is a speech made by Susan Alexander, who was loosely based on Davies, to the reporter Thompson about Kane: “Look, if you’re smart, you’ll get in touch with Raymond. He’s the butler. You’ll learn a lot from him. He knows where all the bodies are buried.” Kael writes, “It’s an odd, cryptic speech. In the first draft, Raymond \"literally\" knew where the bodies were buried: Mankiewicz had dished up a nasty version of the scandal sometimes referred to as the Strange Death of Thomas Ince.\"\n\n\"I don’t think we’re likely ever to know for sure what happened on Hearst’s yacht on November 19, 1924,\" Rosenbaum concluded.\n\n\"No director is more steeped in Hearst/Welles/Kane/Hollywood lore than Bogdanovich,\" wrote film critic Roger Ebert, who heard the Orson Welles version of Thomas Ince's death from Bogdanovich. \"It happened that as Bogdanovich told me this story, we were aboard the QE2, crossing to Southampton on the 25th anniversary voyage of the Telluride Film Festival in 1998. When Bogdanovich returned to New York, there was a script waiting for him. It was an adaptation of Steven Peros' play about the very same scandal. Fate was sending him a message.\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview Bogdanovich said, \"I was talking to Orson for my book, \"This is Orson Welles\" in 1969 and he said, “You know about the thing that happened on Hearst’s yacht?” He said Welles had been told the story by screenwriter Charles Lederer, Marion Davies's nephew, and that Bogdanovich subsequently confirmed the account with Lederer. \"And when Orson told me that story it was virtually the same story as what Steven Peros has written. The particulars in terms of the letter or the hat, those where details hypothesized by Steven, based on his research, but the actual plot — of what happened and who was doing what and why — that was all the same.\"\n\nBogdanovich cast Kirsten Dunst in the role of Marion Davies, as she had \"always wanted to do a twenties story. She has a wonderful period face, looks great in those clothes, and had great instincts.\" In the role of William Randolph Hearst, a different actor had been cast, but Edward Herrman replaced the unnamed actor after he backed out of the project. Eddie Izzard, who Bogdavonich had seen performing stand-up comedy (and who was primarily known as a comedian) was given the role of Charlie Chaplin, as Bogdavonich felt his comedic sensibilities were compatible with the character of Chaplin, who himself was a comedic performer. Cary Elwes was cast as Thomas Ince, while Joanna Lumley obtained the role of novelist Elinor Glyn. Jennifer Tilly was subsequently cast as Louella Parsons, the forthright and nosy journalist aboard the yacht, and was offered the part by Bogdanovich, who had acted opposite Tilly in the 1997 television film \"Bella Mafia\".\n\nThough set in California, filming of \"The Cat's Meow\" took place in coastal Greece, and Berlin, Germany. Bogdanovich wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white to capture the feel of the silent era, but studio heads objected. (Black-and-white scenes of Ince's funeral, resembling old newsreel footage, bookend the film.) To compensate, the director ordered costume designer Caroline de Vivaise to dress the cast in only black and white. With only a few weeks to prepare prior to the start of filming, she resorted to shopping in secondhand stores for vintage clothing. Bogdanovich agreed to her request to have some silver and gold on the costumes when many of the pieces she found were trimmed with those colors.\n\nThe vessel used to represent the Oneida was actually the \"Marala\". She was originally named \"Evadne\", the private yacht of Charles Fairey of Fairey Aviation, and had patrolled the approaches to Bermuda, and its Royal Naval Dockyard, during the Second World War as HMS \"Evadne\".\n\nComposer Ian Whitcomb's score was augmented by original recordings that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. These included \"Avalon,\" \"Toot Toot Tootsie,\" and \"California, Here I Come\" by Al Jolson; \"Everybody Loves My Baby\" and \"Wild Cat Blues\" by Clarence Williams; \"Stumbling,\" \"Say It With Music,\" \"Somebody Loves Me,\" and \"Linger Awhile\" by Paul Whiteman; and \"Wabash Blues\" by Fletcher Henderson. In addition, Ian Whitcomb & His Bungalow Boys performed many tunes from the era, among them \"Ain't We Got Fun,\" \"I'm Just Wild About Harry,\" \"St. Louis Blues,\" \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,\" \"I'm Nobody's Baby,\" \"Rose of Washington Square,\" \"If You Were the Only Girl in the World,\" \"Margie,\" \"How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?,\" and \"Alice Blue Gown.\"\n\nAfter the film had been completed, music supervisor Joel C. High realised the version of \"Charleston\" heard in the birthday party scene was a jazz-tinged arrangement from the 1950s and had Ian Whitcomb & His Bungalow Boys record an authentic 1920s rendition to replace it. Bogdanovich preferred the livelier, more contemporary sound of the 1950s version but finally was convinced by High to use the more accurate recording.\n\nThe film premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in August 2001. It was shown at the 2001 Flanders International Film Festival in Belgium, the 2001 MIFED Film Market in Italy, the 2002 International Film Festival Rotterdam, and the 2002 Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina before going into limited release in the US in April 2002.\n\nThe film grossed $3,209,481 in the United States and $437,513 internationally for a worldwide total of $3,646,994.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 74% based on reviews from 125 critics.\n\n\"New York Times\" film critic A. O. Scott called the film \"a modest, restrained picture, as small and satisfying as one of Woody Allen's better recent efforts. There is little to distinguish it visually from a made-for-cable historical drama. We observe the events from a polite distance, rather than being plunged into the swirl of decadent Jazz Age high life. The suave camera movements never quite dispel the feeling that we are watching a filmed play. But Mr. Bogdanovich … shows his mastery in his work with the actors, who turn dusty Tinseltown lore into a spry and touching entertainment.\"\n\n\"Apart from its theory about the mistaken death of Ince and its cover-up, the movie's most intriguing theory is that Parsons witnessed it, which might explain her lifetime contract with the Hearst papers,\" wrote Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". \"The film is darkly atmospheric, with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst's forced avuncular chortles. Dunst is as good, in her way, as Dorothy Comingore in \"Citizen Kane\" in showing a woman who is more loyal and affectionate than her lover deserves.\"\n\n\"In some ways, Dunst gives the film’s most impressive performance,\" wrote Jonathan Rosenbaum, who called the film a must-see. \"What’s masterful about Bogdanovich’s direction is the cumulative detail, which adds complexity to incidental as well as central characters. He has a graceful way of switching viewpoints from one character to another and an uninsistent yet mainly persuasive sense of period. … This picture might well be considered a more impressive accomplishment than many of his early pictures. But it speaks with a quieter voice, and what it says seems substantially more personal and thoughtful.\"\n\nIn the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle stated, \"Bogdanovich takes a tale of old Hollywood and infuses it with velocity and enthusiasm. He avoids his twin demons, freneticism and cuteness, and delivers his best picture in years ... His deft use of a single location, his intelligent handling of his ensemble cast and his graceful camera work mark this as a true return to form.\"\n\nDerek Elley of \"Variety\" described the film as \"playful and sporty … Dunst gives her best performance to date amid a skilled older cast. Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy.\"\n\n\"Elegant, funny and unexpectedly touching, this whodunit about a murder aboard the yacht of William Randolph Hearst represents a bracing comeback for Peter Bogdanovich,\" wrote \"Rolling Stone\" film critic Peter Travers. \"Dunst, the teen queen of \"Bring It On\" and \"Crazy/Beautiful\", is showstoppingly good, finding humor, heart and surprising gravity in a character often dismissed as a gold digger.\"\n\nJames Christopher of \"The Times\" wrote, \"The unexpected charm of Bogdanovich's film is that he paints a social scenario worthy of \"Decline and Fall\". His cast are comically hollow and effortlessly insincere … Kirsten Dunst is a marvellous tease as Marion; Eddie Izzard is a manly Chaplin; and Herrmann is hypnotic as the infatuated host who is richer than God.\"\n\nIn the \"Los Angeles Times\", Kevin Thomas stated, \"Peter Bogdanovich, who knows his Hollywood history probably better than any other American director, works from Steven Peros' amusing yet poignant script to tell the popular version of the legend in clever and entertaining fashion, loaded with authentic and convincing details.\"\n\n\"What a tonic to be treated to a movie for that most uncourted, ignored and generally dissed of demographics: the grown-ups,\" wrote Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\". \"Based on an urban legend that has been quietly circulating around Hollywood for almost four decades, \"The Cat's Meow\" would be grounds for libel if the libeled one were still alive … Bogdanovich directs \"The Cat's Meow\" with unfussy clarity, introducing a crowded cast of characters with quick scenes that immediately convey who they are and what they're up to. In the 1970s films \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"Paper Moon\", Bogdanovich coaxed some wonderful performances from his actors, and he clearly hasn't lost that touch: Herrmann inhabits Hearst completely (he even bears an uncanny physical resemblance to the late publisher). Dunst, heretofore relegated to kittenish teen roles, comes as close to capturing Davies' effervescence and spontaneity as anyone has (and no one has). Izzard is also very good as Chaplin.\"\n\n\"Bogdanovich's silent crosscutting between close-ups of the characters helps to shorn the film of its theatrical origins,\" wrote Peter Tonguette in \"The Film Journal\". \"Bogdanovich's sensitivity towards his characters and outright insistence that we see even the most gluttonous and poisonous among them as human beings is rare, and commendable, indeed.\"\n\nKirsten Dunst was named Best Actress at the Mar del Plata Film Festival.\n\nLions Gate Entertainment released \"The Cat's Meow\" on VHS (UPC 031398809531) and DVD (UPC 031398809920) in 2002. A signature series DVD (UPC 031398849520) was released in 2003.\n\n"}

Since the balloon is not controllable, the delivery of a balloon mail is left to good fortune; often the balloon and postcard are lost. A found balloon should be returned to the sender (by conventional post) with an indication of the discovery site, so that the sender can determine how far their balloon flew. Frequently balloon mail is sent as part of a balloon competition.\n\nHistorically, balloons were used to transport mail from Paris during the Siege of Paris of 1870-71. About 66 unguided mail balloons were released from Paris to communicate with the outside world, of which the great majority succeeded in delivering their cargo. As the Prussian forces surrounded the city, telegraph lines were cut and messengers were captured, shot or turned back. Two services were proposed, by \"ballon monté\" (manned balloon) and \"ballon non-monté\" (unmanned). In practice only manned flights were used. After the siege, Anglo-French scientist Dr Pierre Wesby travelled to Burton-on-Trent, where in 1873 he started a business to transport mail across the Irish Sea to Dublin, from England. It is not known how this venture turned out; the records of Wesby's company were lost in 1916, when a bomb from the Zeppelin L 19 destroyed them.\nIn 1877, a 5-cent stamp for balloon postage was privately printed in Nashville, Tennessee to carry mail on a June 18 flight of the \"Buffalo Balloon\" from that city to Gallatin, Tennessee. Of the three hundred stamps produced, only 23 were used.\n\nBalloon mail was sent from Przemyśl, Poland (near the Ukrainian border) during World War I.\n\nBalloon mail has been used for spreading information and propaganda materials, in particular for spreading propaganda to the population in countries with dictatorial governments. A balloon can be released from outside the sphere of influence of these governments and, wind permitting, can travel several hundred kilometers. This method of balloon mail has been used by private activists to distribute leaflets to Warsaw Pact countries from West Germany in the mid-1950s; and by South Koreans to North Korea discussing the health of their leader, Kim Jong-il.\n"}

{"id": "1954499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954499", "title": "Stan Tracey", "text": "Stan Tracey\n\nStanley William Tracey (30 December 1926 – 6 December 2013) was a British jazz pianist and composer, whose most important influences were Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. Tracey's best known recording is the 1965 album \"Jazz Suite Inspired by Dylan Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\"\", which is based on the BBC radio drama \"Under Milk Wood\", by Dylan Thomas.\n\nThe Second World War meant that Tracey had a disrupted formal education, and he became a professional musician at the age of sixteen as a member of an ENSA touring group playing the accordion, his first instrument. He joined Ralph Reader's Gang Shows at the age of nineteen, while in the RAF and formed a brief acquaintance with the comedian Tony Hancock. Later, in the early 1950s, he worked in groups on the transatlantic liners \"Queen Mary\" and \"Caronia\" and toured the UK in 1951 with Cab Calloway. By the mid-1950s, he had also taken up the vibraphone, but later ceased playing it. At this time he worked widely with leading British modernists, including drummer Tony Crombie, clarinettist Vic Ash, the saxophonist-arranger Kenny Graham and trumpeter Dizzy Reece.\n\nIn February 1957, he toured the United States with Ronnie Scott's group, and became the pianist with Ted Heath's Orchestra in September for two years (1958–59), including a US tour with singer Carmen McRae. Although Tracey disliked Heath's music, he gained a regular income and was well featured as a soloist on both piano and vibes, and contributed compositions and arrangements that stayed in the Heath book for many years. The following year he recorded his first album as leader, \"Showcase\", for English Decca (also Heath's label) and \"Little Klunk\" in 1959; he had first recorded in 1952 with the trumpeter Kenny Baker. At Decca Records, Tracey met his future wife, Jackie Buckland (3 April 1929 – 13 August 2009); the couple had two children Clark and Sarah.\n\nFrom March 1960 until about 1967 (some sources give 1968), Tracey was the house pianist at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, London, and he had the opportunity to accompany many of the leading musicians from the US who visited the club. Recordings of some of these performances appeared on LP and others have appeared in recent years on the Jazz House and Harkit labels, recorded by the journalist Les Tomkins, but with non-professional sound quality. In this context he gained some high-profile admirers; Sonny Rollins asserted at one concert: \"Does anyone here know how good he is?\". It is Tracey on piano that film viewers hear behind Rollins on the soundtrack of the Michael Caine version of \"Alfie\" (1966).\n\nHowever, the experience of working in Scott's club affected Tracey's health; the long hours led to him taking various illicit stimulants, and the low wages also meant that he had to take the workman's bus back home to Streatham at 3am.\n\nAt the same time he became active in Michael Horovitz's New Departures project, mixing poetry performances with jazz, where the musicians interacted spontaneously with the words. The New Departures group recorded an album in 1964 with saxophonist Bobby Wellins, a partnership that continued for several decades. Both men contributed original compositions to the album.\n\nTracey's 1965 album (its full title is \"Jazz Suite Inspired by Dylan Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\"\") is one of the most celebrated jazz recordings made in the United Kingdom. Tracey was inspired to compose the suite by hearing the original 1953 BBC broadcast on an LP his wife Jackie had acquired. The track \"Starless and Bible Black\", a quote from the opening monologue, is probably the best demonstration of Wellins' lyricism and the highlight of Tracey's whole career. Such is the affection with which these pieces are held that Tracey has re-recorded them on several occasions, something that is unusual for British jazz musicians to do. \"Under Milk Wood\" was followed by \"Alice in Jazzland\", an album for big band, the next year featuring many of his former Ted Heath colleagues. Later in the decade, Tracey made the arrangements for an Acker Bilk record, \"Blue Acker\", and his first album dedicated to Duke Ellington compositions (both recorded in 1968), in this case to commemorate Ellington's 70th birthday the following year.\n\nThe early 1970s were a bleak time for Tracey. Around 1970, he almost chose to retrain as a postman under pressure from the Unemployment Benefits' office – \"I would have quite a good pension by now\" he quips – but his wife, formerly involved in public relations, took a more direct role in the development of Tracey's career.\n\nHe began to work with musicians of a later generation, who worked in a free or avant-garde style, including Mike Osborne, Keith Tippett and John Surman. Tracey continued to work in this idiom with Evan Parker at the UK's Appleby Jazz Festival for several years, but this was always more of a sideline for Tracey, who said that he \"took more out of free music into the mainstream than I did from mainstream into free\". Neil Ferber founder and organiser of the Appleby Jazz Festival built the festival around Stan Tracey and the musicians who worked with him, booking Stan to appear at every festival for the 18 years that it existed.\n\nIn the mid-1970s he formed his own record label, Steam, and through it reissued \"Under Milk Wood\" (the major label that held the rights to it had allowed it to fall out of print). Over the next decade he also used the outlet to issue recordings of a number of commissioned suites. These included \"The Salisbury Suite\" (1978), \"The Crompton Suite\" (1981) and \"The Poets Suite\" (1984).\n\nHe led his own octet from 1976 to 1985 and formed a sextet in 1979 (later called Hexad), touring widely in the Middle East and India. In this context he had a longstanding performance partnership from 1978 with saxophonist (and physician) Art Themen, and his own son, the percussionist Clark Tracey. He was able to share the billing with arranger Gil Evans in a 1978 concert at the Royal Festival Hall, such was Tracey's pre-eminence in the UK. In private, he played Ellington recordings for Evans that the latter had not previously heard. Tracey continued to record with American musicians on occasion as well, with dates taking place with Sal Nistico in 1985 and Monk associate, Charlie Rouse in 1987.\n\nThe Steam label ceased trading in the early 1990s, reportedly because of difficulties caused by the retail trade's need for its inventory to carry a barcode. However, in 1992 Tracey benefited from Blue Note's brief interest in UK musicians, leading to the \"Portraits Plus\" album and the commercial issue of the BBC's recording of the concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of Tracey's first professional gig, as well as \"Under Milk Wood\"′s debut on CD.\n\nIn 1995 his new quartet featuring Gerard Presencer recorded the \"For Heaven's Sake\" album and also performed gigs together. In 2003 Tracey was the subject of a BBC Television documentary \"Godfather of British Jazz\", a rare accolade nowadays for any jazz musician, let alone one from Britain. Tracey's catalogue from the LP era is being reissued on ReSteamed Records.\n\nAlready an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.\n\nTracey died of cancer on 6 December 2013; he was survived by his son, Clark Tracey; his daughter died in 2012.\n\n\nWith Prince Lasha\n\n"}

The verse occurs in where John the Baptist is berating the Pharisees and Sadducees. He has previously called them a brood of vipers and warned them of the wrath to come in this verse he urges them to repent.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:8.\n\nLike the rest of this section this verse is mirrored in the Gospel of Luke, with this passage appearing in . Since it is not found in Mark most scholars feel it is most likely taken from Q. The lone difference from Luke is that the word \"fruit\" is pluralized in Matthew.\n\nThis is the first appearance of a fruit metaphor that will recur in and appears in other parts of the New Testament. As the growing of fruit is the clear and outward manifestation of a healthy tree the term is seen as a metaphor for the good works of a true Christian. The call for repentance echoes and links into the eschatological tone of this chapter.\n\nHow these good works link to repentance is a source of much dispute. There are two different interpretations of this passage. The phrase could be read as saying that the Pharisees and Sadducees should do good works in order to be repentant. The other view is that good works are only an outgrowth of internal repentance as a fruit is the product of a healthy tree. The first interpretation is that held by Catholics and the second by Protestants. According to Clarke the modern scholarly consensus is that the wording of this verse is ambiguous and both interpretations are plausible.\n\nThis verse thus became a part of the larger debate over the Protestant doctrine of the justification of faith. Protestants adopted the fruit metaphor in a number of important works. The Augsburg Confession, for instance, states that \"it is taught among us that such faith should produce good fruits and good works and that we must do all such good works as God has commanded, but we should do them for God’s sake and not place our trust in them as if thereby to merit favor before God.\"\n\n"}

Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride. Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas, or several bounces before coming to rest.\n\nMost drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower, with a tower for smaller children from tall, and a tower having a restriction.\n\nDrop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower.

Held in Panama City from 22 June to 15 July of that year, the meeting proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. \n\nIt was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia (comprising the modern-day nations of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela), Peru, the United Provinces of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica), and Mexico. Chile and the United Provinces of South America (Argentina) declined to attend, out of mistrust of Bolívar's enormous influence. The Empire of Brazil did not send delegates, because it expected a hostile reception from its Hispanic neighbours due to its ongoing war with Argentina over modern Uruguay. The isolationist Paraguay (which refused previous delegates from Bolívar) was not invited.\n\nThe grandly titled \"Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation\" that emerged from the congress was ultimately only ratified by Gran Colombia, and Bolívar's dream soon foundered irretrievably with civil war in that nation, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of nationalism. The Congress of Panama also had political ramifications in the United States. President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay wanted the US to attend the congress, to which they had only been invited due to pressure on Bolívar; but as Hispanic America had outlawed slavery, politicians from the Southern United States held up the mission by not approving funds or confirming the delegates. Despite their eventual departure, one of the two US delegates, (Richard Clough Anderson Jr.), died en route to Panama, and the other (John Sergeant) only arrived after the Congress had concluded its discussions. Thus Great Britain, which attended with only observer status, managed to acquire many good trade deals with Latin American countries.\n\n\n\n"}

The first design was rejected due to its difficult and heavy construction. After a re-design in 2002, a license agreement was closed, and the ride was produced in 2005 by Huss Maschinenfabrik GmbH, now HUSS Park Attractions. The first Topple Tower, El Volador, was placed in 2005 at Bellewaerde Park in Belgium.\n\nThe Topple Tower consists of a single 40-person circular gondola, centred on an 18-metre tower. Passengers sit in the gondola, facing outward. When the ride cycle is started, the gondola is raised towards the top of the tower, and begins to rotate at between 9 and 11 rpm. When the rotating gondola reaches the top of the tower, the tower itself begins to rock back and forth.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of the Huss Maschinenfabrik GmbH in July 2006, a lawsuit against the new Huss company, (Huss Park Attractions) was held in November 2008 at Düsseldorf court, in which the Design Company, van Orsouw Amusement Ride Design Service (van Orsouw ARDS) claimed all the rights of the design of the Topple Tower. There were rumours that van Orsouw ARDS was, in fact, a blind-trust company of another, until today unknown, Amusement Ride manufacturer. Following the conclusion of the trial, no noteworthy design activities of van Orsouw ARDS have been observed, though legally the company still exists. Future buyers of the Topple Tower, therefore, run the risk of the blind trust company becoming active again and resuming litigation.\n\nA Topple Tower was purchased by Marineland of Canada in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. It was operated for a few seasons starting in 2007, but it was shut down in 2011 due to a structural crack and has not operated since.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, the Topple Tower installation (known as Timber Tower) at Dollywood became stuck after a faulty safety sensor engaged. The tower was in an upright position with the gondola at the top. The safety system would not let operators override the sensor, leaving 40 passengers stranded on the ride, some for as many as 6 hours. As of the 2012 season, Dollywood has removed Timber Tower from the park, with a lawsuit between Huss and Dollywood resolved behind closed doors. In 2017, Dollywood opened a new ride in place of Timber Tower called Drop Line.\n\n"}

In South Africa, there are between 3 and 4 million Anglicans out of an estimated population of 45 million.\n\nThe primate is the Archbishop of Cape Town. The current archbishop is Thabo Makgoba, who succeeded Njongonkulu Ndungane in 2006. From 1986 to 1996 the primate was Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu.\n\nThe first Anglican clergy to minister regularly at the Cape were military chaplains who accompanied the troops when the British occupied the Cape Colony in 1795 and then again in 1806. The second British occupation resulted in a growing influx of civil servants and settlers who were members of the Church of England, and so civil or colonial chaplains were appointed to minister to their needs. These were under the authority of the governor.\n\nThe first missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel arrived in 1821. He was William Wright, a priest. He opened a church and school in Wynberg, a fashionable suburb of Cape Town. Allen Gardiner, a missionary of the Church Missionary Society went to Zululand, and arranged for a priest, Francis Owen to be sent to the royal residence of King Dingane. Owen witnessed the massacre of Piet Retief, the Voortrekker leader, and his companions, who had come to negotiate a land treaty with Dingane, and left soon afterwards.\n\nThe Anglican Church in Southern Africa at this time was under the Diocese of Calcutta, which effectively included the East Indies and the entire Southern Hemisphere. Bishops en route for Calcutta sometimes stopped at the Cape for confirmations, and occasionally ordination of clergy, but these visits were sporadic. It became apparent that a bishop was needed for South Africa, and in 1847 Robert Gray was consecrated as the first Bishop of Cape Town in Westminster Abbey. The new bishop landed in Cape Town in 1848.\n\nSome Anglican parishes in the then-Cape Colony refused to join the Church of the Province of South Africa when it was constituted in 1870; these parishes constituted themselves as the Church of England in South Africa (CESA). CESA has subsequently renamed itself as Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa.\n\nDesmond Tutu rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid. Tutu was elected and ordained the first black South African Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and primate of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986.\n\nIn 2006, the name Church of the Province of Southern Africa was dropped as the name was confusing to some people. The church was renamed the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.\n\nIn July 2012, Ellinah Wamukoya of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa became the bishop-elect of Swaziland and the first woman to be elected a bishop in any of the twelve Anglican Provinces in Africa. She was consecrated on 17 November 2012 at All Saints Cathedral, Mbabane. On 19 January 2013, Margaret Vertue was consecrated the diocesan bishop of False Bay.\n\nThe polity of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa is episcopal, like that of other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. The province is divided into various dioceses, each led by its own bishop.\n\nThe Anglican Church in Southern Africa has used the following prayer books:\n\nThe Anglican church was a product of the English Reformation and political contexts of the sixteenth century. Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, was instrumental in determining the form Anglicanism was to take, not by writing confessional statements or significant theological treaties, but through his authoring of the Book of Common Prayer in 1549 and 1552. All expressions of Anglicanism forever after defined itself in relation to the concept of the Prayer Book, whether being faithful to the Reformed tradition or seeking different approaches. Other denominations have found unity in confessional documents, or doctrinal formularies, or a systematically articulated theology, or the pronouncements of magisterial authorities.\n\nWhen the work of revising the liturgy in the twentieth century was undertaken it was with the understanding that it was touching the nerve-centre of the Anglican ethos, since Anglican identity takes a more intangible form, deeply dependent upon the influence and binding effect of its liturgical worship. The most recent revision of the Prayer Book resulted in the publishing of \"An Anglican Prayer Book (1989).\" The Anglican Prayer Book stands alongside the South African Book of Common Prayer (1954). Both the 1989 and 1954 prayer books have the English 1662 Book of Common Prayer as a common source.\n\nThe work of the revision reflected the worldwide liturgical renewal, most notably in relation to the Roman Catholic Church as a result of decisions reached at its Second Vatican Council. Another influence was the charismatic renewal, which has had a marked impact on the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. Particular care was taken to meet evangelical concerns in a Province that is historically High Church rather than Low Church in its main emphasis. Theological breadth – catholic, evangelical, charismatic, and liberal – was aimed at in order to achieve balance and to accommodate these various convictions.\n\nThese sensitivities and influences are most evident in the Eucharistic liturgy. Four Eucharistic prayers are given to accommodate different theological preferences. Two are taken from the Church of England, one is borrowed with permission from the Roman Catholic Canon, and pride of place is given in the First Eucharistic Prayer to an indigenous product. The influence of the liturgical movement can be seen in the overall structure and language of the Eucharist, including seeking a sense of continuity with the early, apostolic church.\n\nIn tracing this line of continuity from the Lord’s Table to the Communion Table, a prayer traditionally ascribed to Hippolytus (ca. 215), bishop of Rome, called the Apostolic Tradition, captured the imagination of contemporary liturgists and now appears in the modern liturgical books of different churches both Roman Catholic and Protestant. The opening lines of all four Eucharistic prayers closely mirror the wording of Hippolytus. The fourth Eucharistic prayer most closely maintains the link with the Hippolytus liturgy, but allows slight variation with respect to the wording of \"we offer you\" and \"we bring before you\" to accommodate different theological persuasions. This is an example of how the Anglican Church of Southern Africa in making revisions for the 1989 Anglican Prayer Book adopted a more conciliatory approach to the various ecclesiastical factions, foreshadowing the conciliatory context of South African politics in the early 90s in regard to political factions and political change.\n\nThere are a wide range of beliefs among Anglicans, from Evangelical to Anglo-Catholic, from liberal to traditional, but what unites Anglicans is common prayer \"Lex orandi, lex credendi\".\n\nThe centre of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, (contained in the catechism), include:\n\n\nThe threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Southern Africa embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used. The Church is known for having Anglo-Catholic leanings.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Southern Africa is regarded as the most liberal Anglican province in Africa with respect to the ordination of women and homosexuality. The church ordained the first woman as a deacon in 1985 followed by ordaining three women to the priesthood in 1992. In 2012, the church consecrated Ellinah Wamukoya as the bishop of Swaziland. Later, the church consecrated Margaret Vertue as bishop of False Bay. In 2014, the church appointed the first woman to lead the provincial residential theological college.\n\nThe canon law of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa states that \"marriage by divine institution is a lifelong and exclusive union partnership between one man and one woman.\" The church also does not have an official stance on homosexuality itself. The Church does not allow gay marriage or civil unions but does allow \"same-sex relationships if they are celibate.\" The Diocese of Saldanha Bay has approved of blessing rites for same-sex civil unions. Regarding ordination, the church does not have an official position on the ordination of clergy who identify as gay or lesbian. As examples, in 2003, Rowan Smith, a former dean of St. George's Cathedral, and Douglas Torr, from Johannesburg, came out as gay. An openly gay and celibate bishop, Mervyn Castle, was consecrated in Cape Town. Archbishop Emeritus Ndungane was supportive of the consecration of the first openly partnered gay bishop, Gene Robinson in 2003. Ndungane now supports same-sex marriage blessings. Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, affirmed same-sex marriages and church blessings. Thabo Makgoba, the current Primate and Archbishop, was quoted as being \"one among few church leaders in Africa to support same-sex marriage.\"\n\nThe Diocese of Cape Town, after a synod in 2009, passed a resolution calling the bishops of the church to give pastoral guidelines for homosexual couples who lived in \"covenanted relationships.\" The resolution agreed to \"Affirming a pastoral response to same-sex partnerships of faithful commitment in our parish families.\" It also approved an amendment to the resolution that the guidelines give \"due regard of the mind of the Anglican Communion.\" In 2009 the synod declared that \"[g]ays and lesbians can be leaders within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa as long as they remain celibate\". The Diocese of False Bay has also been supportive of LGBTI people celebrating the ministry of a gay priest. Mervyn Castle, who is openly gay, was consecrated as bishop of False Bay by Desmond Tutu, the then archbishop of Cape Town in 1994. The Diocese of False Bay removed a priest for anti-gay views in 2011. In 2013, the Provincial Synod, governing the church, adopted a resolution that \"urged its bishops to provide guidelines for giving pastoral care to same-sex couples who have entered civil unions under South African law.\" The resolution \"request[s] the Synod of Bishops to work towards finalising the Guidelines for pastoral ministry in response to Civil Unions as soon as possible.\" The resolution says that it \"affirms\" in \"2.1 That God calls us to love and minister to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, while at the same time upholding God’s standards of holiness; 2.2 That this is a highly complex and emotive area which affects many people deeply and has a far reaching impact on the mission of the Church.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Mpho Tutu, the daughter of Desmond Tutu, married her female partner in a civil ceremony in the Netherlands. In 2016, the Revd Charlotte Bannister-Parker, a Church of England priest, presided with her bishop's permission over a service of celebration, and Archbishop Tutu was able to give a blessing for his daughter and her partner. Tutu decided to surrender her license to avoid controversy. Bishop Raphael Hess, of Saldanha Bay, supporting same-sex unions, is seeking to change church policy to allow her to serve. The bishops discussed the issue in February 2016. The official statement said that the church \"cannot advise the legitimizing or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions\". Makgoba also said \"we also tried at the Synod of Bishops to draw up guidelines for clergy wanting to bless couples in same-sex unions, or who want to enter same-sex unions themselves...[but] on this issue, I had to report back...that we were not of one mind.\" The bishops also affirmed members in same-gender marriages as full and equal members of the Church. The message was \"that gay, lesbian and transgendered members of our church share in full membership as baptised members of the Body of Christ.\" In August 2016, the Diocese of Saldanha Bay proposed that the church bless same-gender unions and permit LGBTI priests to marry. A motion to this effect was put the Provincial Synod meeting in September 2016; The voting was as follows:\nArchbishop Makgoba \"added that 'all is not lost.' He said the issue might hopefully be taken up again at the next Provincial Synod in 2019...He also said the issue could be discussed at the local level in parishes and dioceses.\" Makgoba further added \"I was deeply pained by the outcome of the debate.\" After the vote, priests in Saldanha Bay declared they would bless same-gender marriages individually. At least one priest, who is in a same-sex relationship, has said the church ordained him knowing of his relationship.\n\nOn 2 March 2017, the bench of bishops stated that they are working on \"pastoral guidelines for ministry to those in same-sex relationships, which are still incomplete. [The bishops] asked Archbishop Thabo to set up a small group of bishops to work on completing them, together with others who could help the process.\" Archbishop Ndungane also advocated for a same-sex blessing rite. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba set up a working group \"... to amend Canon 34 which will enable ministry to those in Same Sex Unions and the LGBTI Community in the context in which ACSA operates in Southern Africa.\" In 2019, the Provincial Synod voted to establish a permanent commission on human sexuality and to send a report to dioceses, for \"reflection and study,\" that recommends allowing each diocese to choose whether to offer services of prayer following a same-sex civil union during a trial period; a third motion to request that Bishops develop guidelines for pastoral ministry to LGBTQ persons was deadlocked, and did not pass, in a vote of 75 in favour to 75 against.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Southern Africa is a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.\n\nSouth Africa's Anglican church has a more liberal tradition that sets it apart from its more conservative African counterparts. The province has been associated with the most liberal Anglican provinces concerning homosexuality and the acceptance of same-sex unions, such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and South India.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Southern Africa, despite being the most liberal Anglican province in Africa, is a member of the Global South, that unites the most theologically conservative provinces of the Anglican Communion. Moderate conservative Bishop Johannes Seoka, of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, represented the province at the Global South Fourth Encounter that took place in Singapore on 19–23 April 2010 and at their subsequent meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, on 18–20 July 2012. The ACSA adopted the Anglican Communion Covenant proposed by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, as a way to preserve the unity of the Anglican Communion at their provincial synod held in 2010 and ratified the decision at their following meeting in October 2013. At the same time, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba emphasised his province's role of \"being at the heart of Anglican life, often acting as a bridge-builder, and drawing on its own experiences of living with considerable diversity and wrestling with difference.\"\n\nBethlehem Nopece, Bishop of Port Elizabeth, has been the leading name of the Anglican realignment in the province since he strongly opposed the consecration of partnered homosexual Gene Robinson as a bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2003. Nopece was the only bishop of the ACSA to have attended the Global Anglican Future Conference that took place in Jerusalem on 23–28 June 2008. He decided the following year to launch the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans in South Africa after the resolution on 22 August 2009 of the Anglican Diocese of Cape Town to pass pastoral guidelines to members of the church who live in same-sex unions. Nopece presided at the launching of the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans at St. John's Church, Port Elizabeth, on 3 September 2009, with the presence of a retired Anglican Archbishop of Kenya, Benjamin Nzimbi. The event was greeted with messages of support from some of the leading names of the Anglican realignment, archbishops Peter Akinola of the Church of Nigeria, Peter Jensen of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, Robert Duncan of the Anglican Church in North America and Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali of the Church of England. Nopece led a 10 members delegation, which included Bishop Nathaniel Nakwatumbah of the Anglican Diocese of Namibia, to the GAFCON II that took place at Nairobi, Kenya, on 21–26 October 2013. Bishop Nopece led once again the province's delegation to GAFCON III, held in Jerusalem, on 17–22 June 2018, comprised by 18 members, 16 from South Africa, Bishop Vicente Msosa, of the Anglican Diocese of Niassa, as the only delegate from Mozambique, and another one from Namibia.\n\n"}

It sits at the most-southwestern point in all of Rhode Island. It came to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th century as an exclusive summer resort, with wealthy families building sprawling Victorian-style \"cottages\" along the peninsula. Watch Hill is characterized by \"The New York Times\" as a community \"with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth,\" in contrast with \"the overpowering castles of the very rich\" in nearby Newport.\n\nThe area was occupied by Niantic Indians in the 17th century, led by Harman Garrett. Colonists used the hill as an important lookout point during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War, hence the community's name. Some landmarks in the village include the Watch Hill Lighthouse, the first of which was built in 1745; 1880's The Flying Horse Carousel, the oldest operating suspended-horse carousel in the United States and a National Historic Landmark; the Ocean House hotel; and the 1916 Olympia Tea Room.\n\nOne point of interest in Watch Hill is the ruins of Fort Mansfield, an old coastal artillery post situated at the end of Napatree Point. It was one of a series of such forts constructed to guard the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound as part of the coastal defense network for New York City during the Spanish–American War. It was in operation between 1901 and 1909, then was closed down over the course of several years. The land was sold in 1926, and all the government buildings were demolished during the winter of 1928–29. The three concrete gun emplacements were left behind and remain there to this day, offering tunnels and underground rooms to explore. Occasionally at low tide, some remains can be seen of the Battery Connell.\n\nFort Road connected Watch Hill to Fort Mansfield, but the Hurricane of 1938 wiped it out and destroyed 39 houses, the Yacht and Beach Clubs, and a bathing pavilion. Fifteen people were killed and others survived by clinging to wreckage, as they were swept across the bay to Connecticut. Several breachways were created in Napatree Point after the hurricane passed. To this day, Sandy Point remains an island, rather than the northern extension of Napatree. The shortened Napatree Point is now a barrier beach without any roads or houses. It is open to the public, and offers bird watching and surf casting.\n\nWatch Hill sits at the most southwestern point of Rhode Island on a stubby peninsula jutting into Block Island Sound. It includes a smaller peninsula known as Napatree Point, a -long sandy spit that extends west from the Watch Hill business district, and Sandy Point, which was once attached to Napatree Point. Both Napatree and Sandy Point shelter Little Narragansett Bay and have made Watch Hill a popular harbor around which the business district has grown.\n\nWatch Hill is a two-hour drive from Boston and a three-hour drive from New York City. On clear days, there are views of Montauk, New York to the south and Block Island, Rhode Island to the southeast.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Watch Hill was historically home to \"a select group of wealthy families\" whose lives revolved around \"golf and tennis at the Misquamicut Club, bathing and yachting at the Watch Hill Yacht Club, and tea and cocktails at Ocean House and Watch Hill's other grand hotels.\" Wealthy families built sprawling Victorian-style \"cottages\" along the peninsula. The village was known as \"a somewhat staid and family-oriented community compared to glittering Newport, Rhode Island's other, more famous summer colony.\" Famous guests to the seaside resort included Albert Einstein, Douglas Fairbanks, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Groucho Marx, David Niven and Jean Harlow. Stephen Birmingham described Watch Hill as \"an Andorra of Victoriana on the New England shore.\"\n\nFor several generations, the community has maintained its \"old-money summer colony\" atmosphere, even as traditional summer communities have developed, namely Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and the Hamptons. New England traditions are evident in the popular hobbies of its residents, such as golf, sailing, and tennis, as well as the \"privacy-loving, multigenerational families tucked into century-old shingled houses\", with the majority being passed down in families for several generations. \"The New York Times\" notes that \"Watch Hill impresses visitors with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth—the rambling, old-fashioned, turreted and gingerbreaded Victorian summer houses with piazzas and softly rolling lawns have little in common with the overpowering castles of the very rich in Newport, a place rarely mentioned in Watch Hill even though it is barely 30 miles distant.\"\n\nThe waterfront was once lined with huge Victorian hotels. However, fire and hurricanes destroyed almost all during the 20th century. The two remaining hotels are the Ocean House and the Watch Hill Inn; both went through major renovations during the 2000s. The Ocean House was originally opened in 1868; it was torn down in 2005, then completely rebuilt and reopened in 2010. The Ocean House today consists of both hotel rooms and condominiums. It is the only Forbes Five-Star and AAA Five Diamond Hotel in Rhode Island and has been described by \"The New York Times\" as a place which \"conjures up another age, when women wore white gloves to tea and golf was a newfangled pastime.\" Celebrities have holidayed at the hotel, including Hugh Jackman and Regis Philbin.\n\nThe village is listed as a census-designated place. Watch Hill Historic District is a historic district in the village that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. As a state-charted Fire District (1901), the Watch Hill area is authorized to tax residents to fund their volunteer fire department, but the bulk of property taxes go to the town to fund municipal services and schools.\n\nNotable current and former residents of Watch Hill include: \n\n\n"}

Princess Mako has a younger sister, Princess Kako, and a younger brother, Prince Hisahito. She was educated at the Gakushūin School in her Primary, Girls' Junior and Senior High School years. She studied English at University College, Dublin (UCD), in July–August 2010. She had an informal talk with the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, and she visited Northern Ireland.\n\nPrincess Mako graduated from the International Christian University in Mitaka, Tokyo on 26 March 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Art and Cultural Heritage. She obtained Japanese national certification in curation as well as a driver's licence while she was an undergraduate student. On 17 September 2014, she left for the United Kingdom where she studied Museum Studies at the University of Leicester for a year, receiving a Master's degree in January 2016. She also studied art history at the University of Edinburgh for nine months, from September 2012 to May 2013.\n\nShe has been something of an internet idol since 2004, when images of her in sailor fuku appeared on television. An image repository was set up, and a video featuring fanart of Princess Mako was uploaded onto the popular video-sharing website Nico Nico Douga, attracting over 340,000 views and 86,000 comments. The Imperial Household Agency, responding to a request for comment, stated that they are not sure how they should handle this phenomenon, since they see no signs of slander or insults against the Imperial Family.\n\nIn 2011, Mako came of age and was conferred Grand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown on 23 October. Since then, she has been attending official events as an adult member of the Imperial Family.\n\n\nIn August 2006, Mako visited Vienna, Austria for two weeks on a school-sponsored homestay program. She stayed in the home of an Austrian man who was a colleague of Tatsuhiko Kawashima, her maternal grandfather. Because Mako is interested in art and architecture, she visited the museums, St. Stephen's Cathedral and Schönbrunn Palace.\n\nIn July 2011, she worked as a volunteer in the affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami without revealing her identity.\n\nShe is able to communicate using Japanese Sign Language and is interested in the Deaf community, like her mother, Princess Akishino.\n\nShe became the project researcher of the University of Tokyo's museum on 1 April 2016.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that the Princess was expected to marry Kei Komuro, a graduate of International Christian University (ICU). It is anticipated that like her paternal aunt, Sayako, Princess Nori, and other princesses who married commoners in recent decades she will formally lose her title and become a commoner upon marriage. On 3 September 2017, the Imperial Household Agency announced the engagement, which was followed by a press conference attended by the couple. The wedding was originally expected to take place on 4 November 2018, but it was later announced that it would be postponed until 2020. Mako will become the ninth female member of the family to marry a commoner since the passage of the Imperial Household Law. As a result of her marriage, she will give up her imperial title and leave the Japanese Imperial Family, as required by law. At present, the marriage has been put on hold due to Kei Komuro and his family having a financial dispute of which the imperial family disapproves.\n\nMako is known as \"Her Imperial Highness\" Princess Mako.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1954570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954570", "title": "European Single Market", "text": "European Single Market\n\nThe European Single Market, Internal Market or Common Market is a single market which seeks to guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour – the ‘four freedoms‘ – within the European Union (EU). The market encompasses the EU's 27 member states, and has been extended, with exceptions, to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the Agreement on the European Economic Area, to Switzerland through bilateral treaties, and to the United Kingdom through the duration of its transition period as specified in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nA number of potential EU accession candidates have Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU, which allow for limited participation in selected sectors of the Single Market, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. In addition, through three individual agreements on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU, the post-Soviet countries of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine have also been granted limited access to the Single Market in selected sectors. Turkey has access to the free movement of some goods via its membership in the European Union–Turkey Customs Union.\n\nThe market is intended to be conducive to increased competition, increased specialisation, larger economies of scale, allowing goods and factors of production to move to the area where they are most valued, thus improving the efficiency of the allocation of resources. It is also intended to drive economic integration whereby the once separate economies of the member states become integrated within a single EU-wide economy. Half the trade in goods within the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU. The creation of the internal market as a seamless, single market is an ongoing process, with the integration of the service industry still containing gaps. It also has an increasing international element, with the market represented as one in international trade negotiations.\n\nOne of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community (EEC) was the development of a common market offering free movement of goods, service, people and capital (see below). Free movement of goods was established in principle through the customs union between its then-six member states.\n\nHowever the EEC struggled to enforce a single market due to the absence of strong decision-making structures. It was difficult to remove intangible barriers with mutual recognition of standards and common regulations due to protectionist attitudes.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the economy of the EEC began to lag behind the rest of the developed world, Margaret Thatcher sent Arthur Cockfield, Baron Cockfield, to the Delors Commission to take the initiative to attempt to relaunch the common market. Cockfield wrote and published a White Paper in 1985 identifying 300 measures to be addressed in order to complete a single market. The White Paper was well received and led to the adoption of the Single European Act, a treaty which reformed the decision-making mechanisms of the EEC and set a deadline of 31 December 1992 for the completion of a single market. In the end, it was launched on 1 January 1993.\n\nThe new approach, pioneered at the Delors Commission, combined positive and negative integration, relying upon minimum rather than exhaustive harmonisation. Negative integration consists of prohibitions imposed on member states banning discriminatory behaviour and other restrictive practices. Positive integration consists of approximating laws and standards. Especially important (and controversial) in this respect is the adoption of harmonising legislation under Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\nThe Commission also relied upon the European Court of Justice's \"Cassis de Dijon\" jurisprudence, under which member states were obliged to recognise goods which had been legally produced in another member state, unless the member state could justify the restriction by reference to a mandatory requirement. Harmonisation would only be used to overcome barriers created by trade restrictions which survived the \"Cassis\" mandatory requirements test, and to ensure essential standards where there was a risk of a race to the bottom. Thus harmonisation was largely used to ensure basic health and safety standards were met.\n\nBy 1992 about 90% of the issues had been resolved and in the same year the Maastricht Treaty set about to create an Economic and Monetary Union as the next stage of integration. Work on freedom for services did take longer, and was the last freedom to be implemented, mainly through the Posting of Workers Directive (adopted in 1996)<ref name=\"Directive 96/71/EC\">Directive 96/71/EC</ref> and the Directive on services in the internal market (adopted in 2006).<ref name=\"Directive 2006/123/EC\">Directive 2006/123/EC</ref>\n\nIn 1997 the Amsterdam Treaty abolished physical barriers across the internal market by incorporating the Schengen Area within the competences of the EU. The Schengen Agreement implements the abolition of border controls between most member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial co-operation.\n\nEven as the Lisbon Treaty came into force in 2009 however, some areas pertaining to parts of the four freedoms (especially in the field of services) had not yet been completely opened. Those, along with further work on the economic and monetary union, would see the EU move further to a \"European Home Market\".\n\nThe \"Four Freedoms\" of the single market are:\n\nThe customs union of the European Union removes customs barriers between member states and operates a common customs policy towards external countries, with the aim \"to ensure normal conditions of competition and to remove all restrictions of a fiscal nature capable of hindering the free movement of goods within the Common Market\".\n\nAspects of the EU Customs area extend to a number of non-EU-member states, such as Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Turkey, under separately negotiated arrangements.\n\nArticle 30 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\") prohibits border levies between member states on both European Union Customs Union produce and non-EUCU (third-country) produce. Under Article 29 of the TFEU, customs duty applicable to third country products are levied at the point of entry into EUCU, and once within the EU external border goods may circulate freely between member states.\n\nUnder the operation of the Single European Act, customs border controls between member states have been largely abandoned. Physical inspections on imports and exports have been replaced mainly by audit controls and risk analysis.\n\nArticle 30 of the TFEU prohibits not only customs duties but also charges having equivalent effect. The European Court of Justice defined \"charge having equivalent effect\" in \"Commission v Italy\".\n\nA charge is a customs duty if it is proportionate to the value of the goods; if it is proportionate to the quantity, it is a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty.\n\nThere are three exceptions to the prohibition on charges imposed when goods cross a border, listed in Case 18/87 Commission v Germany. A charge is not a customs duty or charge having equivalent effect if:\n\nArticle 110 of the TFEU provides:\n\nIn the \"taxation of rum case\", the ECJ stated that:\n\nFree movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, ‘Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States’. In \"Procureur du Roi v Dassonville\" the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in \"Commission v France\" French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \"manifestly and persistently abstained\" from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36, which outlines all of the justifiable instances. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property\". In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an over-riding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. The \"Eyssen v Netherlands c\"ase from 1981 outlined a disagreement between the science community and the Dutch government whether niacin in cheese posed a public risk. As public risk falls under article 36, meaning that a quantitative restriction can be imposed, it justified the import restriction against the Eyssen cheese company by the Dutch government. \n\nMore generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in \"Schmidberger v Austria\" the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \"fundamental pillars of a democratic society\", against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.\nOften rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case \"Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein\", the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In \"Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA\" the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, \"Commission v Italy\" Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \"neutral and objective statement\" was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, \"Commission v Italy\", the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.\n\nIn contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In \"Keck and Mithouard\" two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In \"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini\" the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In \"Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB\" the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \"race to the bottom\", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.\n\nFree movement of capital was traditionally seen as the fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed to the extent necessary for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, \"all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited\". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and financial transaction tax, are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In \"Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren\" the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a \"definite influence\" through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In \"Commission v Germany\" the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in \"Commission v Portugal\" the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a \"deterrent effect on portfolio investments\" and reduing \"the attractiveness of an investment\". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.\n\nCapital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one country to another (except that Greece currently has capital controls restricting outflows, and Cyprus imposed capital controls between 2013 and April 2015). All intra-EU transfers in euro are considered as domestic payments and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member States of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the Eurozone are also charged as domestic; however, paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.\n\nThe final stage of completely free movement of capital was thought to require a single currency and monetary policy, eliminating the transaction costs and fluctuations of currency exchange. Following a Report of the Delors Commission in 1988, the Treaty of Maastricht made economic and monetary union an objective, first by completing the internal market, second by creating a European System of Central Banks to co-ordinate common monetary policy, and third by locking exchange rates and introducing a single currency, the euro. Today, 19 member states have adopted the euro, while 9 member states have either determined to opt-out or their accession has been delayed, particularly since the Eurozone crisis. According to TFEU articles 119 and 127, the objective of the European Central Bank and other central banks ought to be price stability. This has been criticised for apparently being superior to the objective of full employment in the Treaty on European Union article 3.\n\nWithin the building on the Investment Plan for Europe, for a closer integration of capital markets, in 2015, the Commission adopted the Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) setting out a list of key measures to achieve a true single market for capital in Europe, which deepens the existing Banking Union, because this revolves around disintermediated, market-based forms of financing, which should represent an alternative to the traditionally predominant (in Europe) bank-based financing channel. The EU's political and economic context call for strong and competitive capital markets to finance the EU economy. The CMU project is a political signal to strengthen the Single Market as a project of all 28 Member States, instead of just the Eurozone countries, and sent a strong signal to the UK to remain an active part of the EU, before Brexit.\n\nAs well as creating rights for \"workers\" who generally lack bargaining power in the market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the \"freedom of establishment\" in article 49, and \"freedom to provide services\" in article 56.\n\nIn \"Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano\" the Court of Justice held that to be \"established\" means to participate in economic life \"on a stable and continuous basis\", while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporary basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, should claim for breach of establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In \"Reyners v Belgium\" the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in \"Commission v Italy\" the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no \"prima facie\" infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.\nIn regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in \"R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury\" that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in \"Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen\" the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state of Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \"Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH\" the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in \"Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt\" the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.\n\nThe \"freedom to provide services\" under TFEU article 56 applies to people who provide services \"for remuneration\", especially commercial or professional activity. For example, in \"Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid\" a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In \"Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds\" Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in (Germany). The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. \"Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht\" held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.\n\nIf an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or over-riding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In \"Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën\" a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In \"Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn\" a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In \"Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa\" the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed.\n\nIn May 2015 the Juncker Commission announced a plan to reverse the fragmentation of internet shopping and other online services by establishing a Single Digital Market that would cover digital services and goods from e-commerce to parcel delivery rates, uniform telecoms and copyright rules.\n\nThe free movement of people means EU citizens can move freely between member states for whatever reason (or without any reason) and may reside in any member state they choose if they are not an undue burden on the social welfare system or public safety in their chosen member state. This required reduction of administrative formalities and greater recognition of professional qualifications of other states. Fostering the free movement of people has been a major goal of European integration since the 1950s.\n\nBroadly defined, this freedom enables citizens of one Member State to travel to another, to reside and to work there (permanently or temporarily). The idea behind EU legislation in this field is that citizens from other member states should be treated equally to domestic citizens and should not be discriminated against.\n\nThe main provision of the freedom of movement of persons is Article 45 of the TFEU, which prohibits restrictions on the basis of nationality.\n\nSince its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe.<ref name=\"Case 43/75\">\"Defrenne v Sabena (No 2)\" (1976) Case 43/75, [10]</ref> Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in \"Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie\", a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties appear to have utilised concerns about immigrants taking jobs and benefits.\nThe Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the \"Belgian Football Association v Bosman\", a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In \"Groener v Minister for Education\" the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in \"Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA\" a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In \"Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker\" the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in \"Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg\" the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In \"Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute\" the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in \"Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen\" the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".\n\nFor workers not citizens of the union but employed in one member state with work permit, there is not the same freedom of movement within the Union. They need to apply for a new work permit if wanting to work in a different state. A facilitation mechanism for this process is the Van Der Elst visa which gives easier rules should a non-EU worker already in one EU state need to be sent to another, for the same employer, because of a service contract that the employer made with a customer in that other state.\n\nBeyond the right of free movement to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply by being a human being. But although the Court of Justice stated that ‘Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States’, political debate remains on who should have access to public services and welfare systems funded by taxation. In 2008, just 8 million people from 500 million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority of them workers. According to TFEU article 20, citizenship of the EU derives from nationality of a member state. Article 21 confers general rights to free movement in the EU and to reside freely within limits set by legislation. This applies for citizens and their immediate family members. This triggers four main groups of rights: (1) to enter, depart and return, without undue restrictions, (2) to reside, without becoming an unreasonable burden on social assistance, (3) to vote in local and European elections, and (4) the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host state, but for social assistance only after 3 months of residence.\nFirst, article 4 of the Citizens Rights Directive 2004 says every citizen has the right to depart a member state with a valid passport or national identity card. This has historical importance for central and eastern Europe, when the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall denied its citizens the freedom to leave. Article 5 gives every citizen a right of entry, subject to national border controls. Schengen Area countries (of which Ireland is not included) have abolished the need to show travel documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in TFEU article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of \"sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system\". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, TEU article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the European Parliament wherever a citizen lives.\nFourth, and more debated, article 24 requires that the longer an EU citizen stays in a host state, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services, on the basis of equal treatment. This reflects general principles of equal treatment and citizenship in TFEU articles 18 and 20. In a simple case, in \"Sala v Freistaat Bayern\" the Court of Justice held that a Spanish woman who had lived in (Germany) for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to child support, without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one. In \"Trojani v Centre public d’aide sociale de Bruxelles\", a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the \"minimex\" allowance from the state for a minimum living wage. In \"Grzelczyk v Centre Public d’Aide Sociale d’Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve\" a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the \"minimex\" income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in \"R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing\" the Court of Justice held that it was lawful to require a French UCL economics student to have lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional \"settled status\". Similarly, in \"Commission v Austria\", Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid \"structural, staffing and financial problems\" if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem. However, in \"Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig\", the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny child support to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked.

{"id": "1954579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954579", "title": "Cody (Final Fight)", "text": "Cody (Final Fight)\n\nCody first appears as the lead character of the 1989 beat-em-up \"Final Fight\", where he is one of the three playable characters in the game, with Cody being the well-balanced character of the trio. In the game, he is a martial artist whose girlfriend Jessica has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang. He teams up with his friend and rival Guy, and Jessica's father Haggar, to defeat the gang. In the game, he wears hand wraps, a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and tennis shoes.\n\nAfter the events of \"Final Fight\", Cody is mentioned in the SNES sequel, \"Final Fight 2\", where he is shown in the opening flashback to be the one delivering the finishing blow to the Mad Gear gang's leader, Belger, from within the first game, but Cody himself does not appear from within the second game at all. His absence from the second game was explained in that he was taking a vacation with Jessica during the time of \"Final Fight 2\".\n\nCody makes a cameo appearance in Guy's \"Final Fight\"-themed home stage in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", where he is being cuddled by his girlfriend Jessica at the left corner of the stage; if a female character is in front of Cody, he will draw his attention away from Jessica and towards the female fighter for a moment until an envious Jessica slaps Cody in the face and regains his attention. The couple makes a similar cameo appearance in \"Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter\", in which they're among the spectators watching the fight at the background of the \"Mall Madness\" stage.\n\nHis next major appearance was in 1998's \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", being the fourth \"Final Fight\" character to appear in the \"Alpha\" sub-series. In this game, Cody had ended his relationship with Jessica (who has since left Metro City to study abroad in Europe) and became a convicted felon, having been thrown into jail after becoming a vigilante. Bored with his peaceful life, Cody had wandered the streets looking for any riffraff he could find, and subsequently beat them into submission until he was finally caught and jailed. Instead of his jeans and white T-shirt from \"Final Fight\", Cody's wardrobe now consists of a blue-and-white striped prison uniform with handcuffs on his wrists (which he is actually able to remove when he taunts his opponent, but fights wearing them anyway) and stubble on his face. His fighting style in the game is modeled after his abilities from \"Final Fight\". During his single-player storyline, Cody is challenged by Birdie and ends up joining forces with his friend and former ally Guy in his fight against M. Bison.\n\nCody would appear in two subsequent \"Final Fight\" games following his appearance in \"Alpha 3\". \"Final Fight Revenge\", an American-developed 3D fighting game based on \"Final Fight\" also released in 1998, features Cody from within his depiction in the original \"Final Fight\". In his character's ending, he gets arrested by police officer Edi E. after being framed by the surviving members of Mad Gear and he is shown in Poison's ending wearing the same jailbird outfit he wears in \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\". A second American-produced \"Final Fight\" spinoff, 2006's \"\", features Cody Travers as the elder brother and mentor of the new main character, Kyle Travers. Cody wears his classic original outfit, but with an orange prison shirt over the T-shirt. Prior to the events of the game, Cody was willingly incarcerated for an unspecified crime committed by Guy, causing a fallout between the two former friends. Upon getting out of prison, Cody's constant fighting had taken its toll upon his own knees, in which he had developed arthritis from within them and that Cody himself was forced to retire from mainstream fighting, becoming a cornerman for Kyle during his run from within Metro City's underground pit fighting circuit. During the events of \"Final Fight Streetwise\", Kyle learns that Cody had been taking a new street drug known as \"GLOW\", which is said to give the user immense strength and power, but turns them violent and dangerous at the same time. Eventually, Cody is kidnapped by Father Bella (who is later revealed to be the younger brother of Belger) and is used as a brainwashed guinea pig by Bella, who seeks revenge against him for the death of his brother. In the end, Cody regains his senses and helps Kyle defeat Bella.\n\nCody returned as one of the new characters in \"Super Street Fighter IV\", breaking out of prison to try to cure his boredom. His rival is Guy, who tries to convince him to team with him to fight Seth. In his ending after he defeats Seth, Cody runs into Guy once again and after deflecting Guy's praise, leaves to return to his cell where he claims he belongs. Cody is also featured as a playable character via DLC in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", with Guy as his official tag partner.\n\nCody returned as a playable character in \"Street Fighter V\" as part of its third season of downloadable content. Now free from prison and no longer forced to wear the uniform and handcuffs, Cody succeeds Mike Haggar as the new Mayor of Metro City, though he is bored with the bureaucracy of the position and misses fighting the city's gangs.\n\nIn \"Final Fight\", Cody is the balanced character, with both moderate strength and speed; he is also the only player capable of stabbing when armed with a knife. By the time of his appearance in \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", Cody has gained new special moves and super combos. His trademark attacks are the \"Bad Stone\", in which he throws a normal rock with the force of other fighter's projectiles; the \"Criminal Upper\", in which he throws an uppercut that releases a multi-hitting tornado that blocks projectiles; the \"Ruffian Kick\", a charging kick attack that varies on attack level depending on which button is used; and the ability to use a knife lying in the middle of the stage in all of his fights, which Cody can pick up and use.\n\n\"Final Fight: Streetwise\" sees an alternate version of Cody, dubbed \"Death\", as he was chosen by a Metro City priest, Father Bella, to be a living incarnation of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This version of Cody has a more demonic look to him due to the fact that Cody is drugged with a mysterious substance that is dubbed \"The GLOW\" (in reference to how the eyes of the user looked after taking the drug) and has a version of the \"Criminal Upper\" that emits a greenish glow. In addition, he gains the ability to throw waves of green energy that travel along the ground like many projectiles in SNK fighting games, as well as the ability to rain green energy down around himself.\n\nIn the \"Street Fighter\" series, Cody's attack speed has been reduced. Similar to Makoto, he relies on hard-hitting strikes from multiple directions to keep the opponent guessing. As a callback to \"Final Fight\", Cody can use a knife to augment his attacks. In \"Super Street Fighter IV\", he also uses a pipe and wrench during certain attacks.\n\nAn episode of the American \"Street Fighter\" animated series titled \"Final Fight\" adapts the plot of the original 1989 beat-em-up game, with Cody portrayed as a slow-witted, short-tempered character with a southern accent. In the episode, Cody and Guy, after learning that Cody's girlfriend and Haggar's daughter Jessica is kidnapped by the Mad Gear gang, go off to fight them on their own accord, while Ryu and Ken are hired by Haggar to infiltrate the gang in order to help find and save his daughter. Cody knocks Belger from the top window of his penthouse (although Belger is not killed), and rescues Jessica. He also appears in some of the \"Street Fighter\" comics by UDON. In \"Resident Evil Zero\", Billy Coen can have Cody's prison outfit as an extra costume as a DLC. Professional wrestler Kenny Omega portrayed Cody for a live action \"Street Fighter V\" trailer.\n\nCody's reception has been mostly positive. Cody was one of the seven characters that IGN wished most to see in \"Street Fighter IV\", while WhatCulture included him among the ten characters they wished to see appear in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". In the official survey by Namco, Cody is the 16th most requested character to be added to the roster of \"Tekken X Street Fighter\" on the \"Street Fighter\" side. He was ranked the 45th top \"Street Fighter\" character by UGO.com. Ryan Woo of \"Complex\" included Cody from the early \"Final Fight\" games on 2011 list of 25 most stylish video game characters. That same year, \"Complex\" also ranked him as the 38th \"most dominant\" fighting game character, as \"a shining example\" of \"a fallen hero becomes a kickass crook when being the good guy gets boring\", adding, \"Who else you know can manage to fight with handcuffs on the whole time?\" Actor Robin Williams named his son Cody Williams after a video game character, which is believed to be Cody from \"Final Fight\". In a 2018 worldwide poll by Capcom, Cody was voted fifth most popular \"Street Fighter\" character.\n"}
{"id": "1954581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954581", "title": "Detroit Express", "text": "Detroit Express\n\nThe Detroit Express was a soccer team based in suburban Detroit that played in the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1978 to 1980. Its home field was the Pontiac Silverdome. The Express were co-owned by Roger Faulkner and by famed English soccer pundit Jimmy Hill who was also the managing director and chairman of the English club Coventry City. The team was coached by Ken Furphy.\n\nThe Express were Detroit's first professional soccer team since the ASL's Detroit Mustangs disbanded in 1973, and the city's first NASL entry since the Detroit Cougars played their last season in 1968. The club made a splash by signing by England forward Trevor Francis; he missed the first third of the season (arriving only after the European season ended in May), but still led the team with 22 goals and ten assists in 19 games. The coach's son, forward Keith Furphy, was second in scoring with 11 goals and 12 assists, while David Bradford and Alan Brazil added nine goals each. \nOn July 12, Francis scored five times as the Express slaughtered the San Jose Earthquakes, 10–0, which as of 2019 is still the widest margin of victory in an American major pro soccer match (NASL or MLS). Detroit went on to win the NASL American Conference Central Division title with a 20–10 mark, and Francis had the only tally in a 1–0 defeat of the Philadelphia Fury in the first round of the playoffs. In the second round, the Express split a pair of games with Fort Lauderdale Strikers, but lost the mini-game immediately afterward, 1–0. Despite their on-field success, however, the Express were only mediocre at the box office, with an average attendance of 12,194, good enough for seventh place in the 24-team NASL but less than the league average of 13,084.\n\nBack in England, Francis made history as the first player in the UK to command a £1 million transfer when he was purchased by Nottingham Forest from Birmingham City. Forest was not keen to allow their new asset to return to the States, but they relented and Francis returned just past the midway point of the 1979 season. He drew large crowds and contributed 14 goals and 8 assists in 14 games, tying Keith Furphy for the team lead; Ted MacDougall added nine goals and 11 assists. But the Express struggled to a 14–16 season and a third-place finish. They were then swept out of the playoffs 2–0 in the first round by the Tampa Bay Rowdies. Despite the disappointment on the field, attendance improved at the cavernous Pontiac Silverdome, up to 14,058 per match, right around the NASL average of 14,201.\n\nAfter 1979, though, Trevor Francis would not return to the NASL. Widely recognized as one of the finest forwards to play in the NASL, Francis notched 36 goals with 18 assists in just 33 regular-season matches—which placed him one spot ahead of Pelé on the all time NASL scoring list, despite playing 23 fewer games. (Francis also had three goals and three assists in five playoff games.) He was a first team all-star selection in 1978 and 1979 alongside Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia, Johan Cruyff, Carlos Alberto and Rodney Marsh and other international greats., and the only Detroit player ever to be selected to the NASL first XI. (Francis would return to the Express in 1981 for an exhibition game against the ASL All-Stars; the All-Stars won, 2–0, in front of 14,500 at the Silverdome.)\n\nThe Express headed indoors that winter to play in the 1979–80 NASL Indoor season. They had competition, as the Major Indoor Soccer League also decided to place a franchise in the Motor City: the Detroit Lightning. The Express managed a 7–5 record, third place in the Eastern Division and a playoff spot; unfortunately, the same Tampa Bay Rowdies that beat Detroit in the outdoor playoffs crushed them in the first round, 12–1, in St. Petersburg. (Tampa Bay would go on to beat Memphis to claim the championship.) Neither of Detroit's indoor soccer teams did much at the box office: The Express drew 3,937 fans per match at the Silverdome, while the Lightning could only manage 3,520 a game at Cobo Hall. (The Lightning would move to San Francisco and then Kansas City.)\n\nWithout Francis, the Express slipped to a 14–18 mark, missing the playoffs and drawing only 11,198 a game—not all that bad by NASL standards, but not enough to pay the bills, either. Argentinian Pato Margetic was signed to replace Trevor Francis at the forward spot and he led the team with 11 goals and 11 assists. Gary Bannister and Adam Oates added 10 goals each, while Bradford finished with 16 assists. Wearing the number 10 shirt, David Bradford scored 14 goals and had 38 assists in his three years with the Express.\n\nThe Express' second and last indoor season produced only a 7–11 record, and they missed the playoffs. Attendance improved to 4,761, a bit below league average, but it wasn't enough to save the Express. In the spring of 1981, Jimmy Hill won a court battle to move the team to RFK Stadium to become the new Washington Diplomats, replacing the old franchise of that name which had folded. The Express-turned-Diplomats lasted just one season in D.C. before going out of business. Hill reportedly lost £2 million because of the failed venture, prompting his son to claim <nowiki>\"We've lost all the family money. All we have left is our home.\"</nowiki>\n\nThe Detroit Express name and logo was retained by local businessman Sonny Van Arnem, who started the new Express team in the 1981 season. The ASL version of the Express won the league title in 1982, but the league folded after the 1983 season. The NASL collapsed after the 1984 season.\n\nGeorge Best also appeared for the Express during a tour of Europe in September 1978. Best played two games in Austria with the Express before the team headed to Switzerland.\n\nIn the November 2009 episode of \"How I Met Your Mother\" called \"Bagpipes\", Ted wears an old Detroit Express shirt when trying to complain to his neighbors about their bagpiping.\n\nMac also wears a Detroit Express shirt in the Season 5 (2009) episode \"The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention\" of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\".\n\n"}

The team was brought to Edmonton by local entrepreneur and Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, after witnessing the strong support for Brian Rice's Edmonton Black Gold team in 1978. Previous to playing in Edmonton, the team was known as the Oakland Stompers, Hartford Bicentennials and Connecticut Bicentennials.\n\nJoe Petrone was the Drillers general manager for their entire existence. The Drillers were coached in 1979 and 1980 by Hans Kraay, who brought a number of players with him from the Netherlands. After Kraay, Timo Liekoski took over as coach in 1981, while Patrone would serve as the team's final caretaker coach until the team folded at the end of the 1982 season.\n\nDuring the outdoor season, the Drillers played their home games at Commonwealth Stadium, but dwindling crowds during the final year saw the team move to much older and smaller Clarke Stadium, which led to even fewer fans attending the games. The Drillers played their two seasons of indoor soccer at Northlands Coliseum and also at Edmonton Gardens. The outdoor team was characterized by a strong defensive style of play, but their indoor style was built upon a run-and-go style of attack. Attendance for the outdoor games ranged greatly from 10,000 in the early stages of the franchise to 4,000 per game in 1982. By comparison, the more successful and profitable indoor games had attendances ranging between 5,000 and 7,000 paying fans per game in 1981 and 1982.\n\nBecause the Northlands Coliseum was booked, Game 1 of the 1981 NASL indoor finals was instead played at the slated-for-demolition Edmonton Gardens. On March 2, 1981 the Drillers defeated the Chicago Sting, 9–6, in front of 5,089 fans to lead the series.\nIn Game 2, played five days later, Edmonton came from behind to down the Sting, 5–4, in front of a then-record NASL indoor crowd of 16,257 at Chicago Stadium to sweep the finals and claim the 1981 NASL indoor championship.\n\nIn 1982, costs were skyrocketing for the team as they were with a number of the other NASL franchises. In Edmonton's case in particular, the following have been speculated as factors connected with the team's collapse: poor support by local media; difficulties stemming from a tricky deal with the owners of the Coliseum and Commonwealth Stadium relating to the attendance, concessions and parking at the indoor games; and as admitted by John Colbert, the Drillers' business manager in 1982, a business strategy that consisted a \"top-down construction\" for the team (i.e., bringing in expensive international players as opposed to developing cheaper local talent).\n"}

They played from 1978 to 1980. Their home field was the Astrodome. Their colors were orange, white and red.\n\nThe team was the last of six expansion teams granted for the 1978 season and had about three months to sign players and sell tickets. Though the coach, Timo Liekoski, who had been an assistant with the Dallas Tornado, was capable, assembling a competitive team in so short a time would be daunting. In any case, the Hurricane placed last in its first season with ten wins of thirty matches (there were no draws in the NASL) and drew a miserable average attendance of 5,806, with only the Chicago Sting and San Diego Sockers drawing less in the 24-team league.\n\nIn the 1979 season, the Hurricane produced the second best record in the league, winning the division with 22 wins in thirty matches. Timo Liekoski was awarded Coach of the Year honors. But the Hurricane couldn't replicate those results in the playoffs, losing to the Philadelphia Fury in two straight. Average attendance was better at 6,211 but was still next to last in the league - the worst being Philadelphia. Kyle Rote, Jr. had joined the Hurricane that season, but left the team after the season on a relief mission to Cambodia and later retired from soccer.\n\nThe Hurricane didn't do as well in what turned out to be their final season, placing second in the division and again losing in the playoffs versus the Edmonton Drillers. They won fourteen and lost eighteen in the expanded schedule, and attendance fell to 5,818 a match, with only the Atlanta Chiefs and, again, Philadelphia being the only teams with worse gates.

Its proponents are involved in a global \"anti-structural revolt\" against modernity and post-modernity, largely in the form of loosely connected intellectual communities that strive to diffuse a similar far-right philosophy in European societies.\n\nENR leaders are generally opposed to liberalism, individualism, egalitarianism, and the nation-state. They endorse a communitarian and organicist world view, and advocate the concept of ethnopluralism, which they describe as a global project where collective identities would coexist peacefully within separated geographical spaces. They do not share, however, a standard and collective political agenda. Instead, ENR leaders promote their ideas via a common \"metapolitical\" practice of politics to eventually achieve cultural hegemony within Europe.\n\nAlthough the extent of the relationship is debated by scholars, the European New Right has influenced the ideological and political structure of the Identitarian Movement. Part of the alt-right also claims to have been inspired by Alain de Benoist's writings, arguably the most influential figure of the movement.\n\nThe European New Right (ENR) emerged in France from the Nouvelle Droite, an intellectual movement linked to the ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE, established in 1968 by Alain de Benoist and Dominique Venner. The original prominence of the French nucleus has declined over the decades, and the movement now appears in the form of a European network of various groups, parties and intellectuals, all sharing ideological similarities and affinities between each other. Among them are the Neue Rechte in Germany, New Right (defunct) in the United Kingdom, Nieuw Rechts (defunct) and Deltastichting in the Netherlands and Flanders, Forza Nuova in Italy, Imperium Europa in Malta, Nova Hrvatska Desnica in Croatia, or Noua Dreapta in Romania. In Italy, the Nueva Destra emerged from the initiative of a group of young members of the neo-fascist party Italian Social Movement.\n\nThe ENR has gone through several re-synthesis since its emergence in the late 1960s. The last attempt at a common doctrine dates back to the manifesto \"The New Right in the year 2000\". Its leading ideas were \"the critique of liberalism and of the commodification of the world; the rejection of individualism; an attachment to an organicist and communitarian view of society; the rejection of egalitarianism and of the various forms of monotheism from which it arose; the promotion of well-rooted collective identities and of the \"right to difference\"; the rejection of the nation-state as a form and the promotion of a federalist model that applies the principle of subsidiarity; and a view of international relations based on the idea of a multi-polar world in which Europe would be endowed with its own nationhood, apart from American omnipotence, which is designated the chief enemy of the European peoples.\"\n\nAccording to Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, the essential idea of the ENR is their rejection of the \"eradication of cultural identities\", caused in their views by the principles of standardization and egalitarianism contained in the idea of human rights, what Alain de Benoist calls the \"ideology of sameness\". New Right thinker Tomislav Sunić emphasized Oswald Spengler's influence in the ENR, especially his assumption that mankind does not exist as such, that \"each culture passes through various cycles\", and that the concept of universal history is a non-sense, as there are only a \"plurality of histories and their unequal distribution in time and space.\"\n\nENR thinker believe that the West is living in an \"interregnum\" that will give way sooner or later to a new era. According to Roger Griffin, they developed in response a worldview founded on a \"maze-way re-synthesis\" of old and new ideological and ritual elements, combined in a \"palingenetic metanarrative\". The current political order is portrayed as needing to be abandoned or purged of its impurity, so that the \"redemptive community\" can leave the phase of liminal crisis to usher in the new era. Additionally, ENR leaders frequently invoke a legendary and mythical past they want to symbolically re-ground in the new society about to emerge, not in a spirit of nostalgia for the return of an ancient golden age, but rather \"to create a rooted futurity, a new reality re-established on firm metaphysical foundations.\" This idea is particularly embodied in the concept of archeofuturism promoted by Guillaume Faye.\n\nSome ENR thinkers, part of a neo-völkisch leaning in the movement, focus on the ethnic concept as the core dimension of \"identity\". This has led to violent rejection of the \"difference\", Faye calling for a \"total ethnic war\", and Pierre Vial for an \"ethnic revolution\" and a \"war of liberation\".\n\nRoger Griffin and Tamir Bar-On argue that the ENR is at the origin of a subtle strategy to reinvent the general framework of fascism while preserving the original fascist world view and ideas. They compare the metapolitical stance of ENR leaders to the strategy advocated by neo-fascist thinker Maurice Bardèche in his 1961 book \"What is Fascism?\", where he averred that fascism could survive the 20th century in a new guise:\n\n"}

The NASL incarnation of the club was Jacksonville's first professional soccer team, and the first major league-level sport franchise ever based in the city.\n\nThe team originated as the New England Tea Men, based in Foxborough, Massachusetts, retaining their Boston Tea Party-themed name after moving to Jacksonville. They played both outdoor and indoor soccer, with the Gator Bowl Stadium and the Jacksonville Coliseum serving as their home fields. Though they performed well on the field in their first year, they were ultimately unable to overcome the financial difficulties that had plagued them since New England, and were disbanded by the NASL after the 1981–1982 season. A new owner brought the Tea Men into the minor league-level American Soccer League the next season, where they won the 1983 ASL Championship. They moved into the new United Soccer League in 1983, but financial pressures caused the team to fold after the end of the season.\n\nThe team originated as the New England Tea Men, who joined the North American Soccer League (NASL) as an expansion team for the 1978–1979 season. Their owner was the tea company Lipton, who gave the team its unusual name in reference to the Boston Tea Party. In their first season the Tea Men had a contract to play at Foxboro Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the New England Patriots National Football League (NFL) team. The team made the league playoffs and sold well in their first season, but were forced out of their stadium the next year, and sales declined precipitously. They were able to return to Foxboro 1980, but under a new, restrictive lease that forced them to play many games at off times. Ticket sales plummeted even further, and Lipton decided to relocate the team to Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nAs such, Jacksonville got its first ever professional soccer team, as well as its first major league-level team in any sport. Lipton, which had already lost $1 million on its franchise, decided to retain the Tea Men name, not wanting to lose the marketing tie-in or spend any further money on rebranding. Many commentators, and even the players themselves, noted the name made no sense in a Florida city with no connection to tea, but it stuck regardless. The team's indoor games were played at Jacksonville Coliseum, while their outdoor games were played at the Gator Bowl Stadium.\n\nThe Tea Men entered the playoffs in their first year in Jacksonville, advancing to the conference semifinals. However, despite drawing strong crowds to their first games, peaking with a crowd of 17,128 at their first outdoor game, attendance waned later in the season, eventually dropping to around 10,000. Lipton, which announced that it had lost $2 million since the relocation decided to pull out. At the urging of mayor Jake Godbold, a group of Jacksonville investors raised funds to lease the team from Lipton and keep it operating the next season. However, the team struggled through the year on and off the field, finishing dead last in the NASL and drawing an average of only 7,160 fans per game, the second worst in the league. The NASL disbanded the struggling franchise.\n\nHowever, Jacksonville businessman Ingo Krieg took over the Tea Men, with the intention of keeping the club alive in the minor leagues. The Tea Men joined the American Soccer League (ASL) for the 1983 season. There they found immediate success, going on to win the 1983 league championship. However, Krieg became concerned about that the ASL was not financially solvent, and withdrew the team to join the new United Soccer League. The Tea Men played through the season, but were unable to overcome their lingering financial difficulties. They folded before the beginning of the 1985 season, marking the end of the franchise.\n\nDuring their time in the NASL the Tea Men's coach was Irishman Noel Cantwell, former manager of Coventry City (1967–1972) and Peterborough United (1972–1977). The assistant coach was Dennis Viollet, former player for Manchester United. Viollet remained in Jacksonville, where he coached the minor league Tea Men and later, the Jacksonville University Dolphins men's college soccer team. Notable players include goalkeeper Arnie Mausser, midfielder Archie Gemmill and strikers Alan Green and Ricardo Alonso.\n\n\nLeague Goal Scoring Champion\nLeague Leading Goaltender\nNASL All-Stars\nU.S. Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nASL MVP\n\nASL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR\n\n\n"}

Running perpendicular to Saint Catherine Street, Crescent Street descends from Sherbrooke Street south to René Lévesque Boulevard.\n\nCrescent Street is a popular attraction for both tourists and locals. North of De Maisonneuve Boulevard, there are many luxury boutiques and art galleries in a Victorian architectural setting. To the south of de Maisonneuve is a concentration of nightclubs, bars, and restaurants.\n\nThe street, which opened around 1860, was originally in the form of a crescent, and was just north of Dorchester Boulevard.\n\nThe first bar on Crescent Street opened in 1967. Until then, the street had mainly professional offices. The first bar was the Sir Winston Churchill Pub, a pub partly owned by Johnny Vago, a Hungarian immigrant who once participated in the Cuban Revolution. Vago's discotheque, originally known as the Don Juan, was first on nearby Stanley Street. It relocated as a basement pub without a dance floor on Crescent after the basement of the Stanley Street building had to be re-engineered since parts of the Don Juan's dance floor had begun to fall into the Montreal Metro tunnel that was then being dug beside it.\n\nA few months later, the basement of the adjoining Crescent Street building was opened up as the Boiler Room, a somewhat noisier pub, replete with large \"quart\" (22 oz.) bottles of beer, cheaper meals, a dance floor, and its jukebox, catering more to the local students and bohemian crowd, leaving the original Winston Churchill as a quieter pub for the older crowd. The two bars were served by a common kitchen.\n\nAnother key business on the street in the 1970s was Librairie L'Androgyne, the city's first LGBT-oriented bookstore.\n\nA few years later (c. 1975), the Boiler Room was closed and redone by Vago as an extension to the Winston Churchill but keeping the Boiler Room's dance floor. A few years later, the Winston Churchill expanded upstairs to the first and then the 2nd floors of the building and eventually became a very large restaurant and bar complex occupying the whole building.\n\nVago eventually ended up owning many bars on the block, but he has since sold his businesses.\n\nGiven the success of the first establishment, other restaurants and bars would settle in the mid-1970s.\n\nCrescent Street merchants formed the Crescent Street Merchants Association in 1998 to promote the street's businesses.\n\nSince the early 2000s, the Crescent Street Merchants Association have organized activities related to the city's sports and entertainment events. The most popular event is the Grand Prix Festival, which takes place each year at the time of the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix in June.\n\nCrescent Street is home mostly to pubs, restaurants, and night clubs. One such business is the Lebanese restaurant Boustan, north of De Maisonneuve Boulevard. Crescent Street is known for its nightclubs that cater to both locals and tourists.\n\nCrescent Street was also home to the Russian restaurant The Troika, which closed in April 2012 and has now replaced by the Brass Door Pub & Grill.\n\nCrescent Street merchants hold an annual street fair, known as the Grand Prix Festival, the week prior to the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix. There are open-air free concerts, terraces for the bars into the streets, street vendors, and racing displays. The festival unofficially kicks off Montreal's festival season.\n\n\n"}

The original exposure draft was distributed in February 2002.\n\nSAS 99, which supersedes SAS 82, was issued partly in response to contemporary accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Tyco. The standard incorporates recommendations from various contributors including the International Auditing & Assurance Standards Board. SAS 99 became effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2002.\n\nSAS 99 defines fraud as an intentional act that results in a material misstatement in financial statements. There are two types of fraud considered: misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting (e.g. falsification of accounting records) and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets (e.g. theft of assets or fraudulent expenditures). The standard describes the fraud triangle. Generally, the three 'fraud triangle' conditions are present when fraud occurs. First, there is an incentive or pressure that provides a reason to commit fraud. Second, there is an opportunity for fraud to be perpetrated (e.g. absence of controls, ineffective controls, or the ability of management to override controls.) Third, the individuals committing the fraud possess an attitude that enables them to rationalize the fraud.\n\nThis requirement is a new concept in audit standards and it has two primary objectives. The first objective is so the engagement team will have an opportunity for the seasoned team members to share their experiences with the client and how a fraud might be perpetrated and concealed. The second objective is to set the proper \"tone at the top\" for conducting the engagement. The brainstorming session is to be conducted in a manner that models the proper degree of professional skepticism and sets the culture for the entire audit.\n\nSAS 99 requires auditors to ask management questions about their awareness and understanding of fraud. Auditors will then make a decision as to whether they need to 'educate' management about fraud and the types of controls that will deter and detect fraud. The standard also requires auditors to make inquiries of the audit committee, internal audit personnel and others within the entity.\n\nThis section provides guidance and support on how to identify and assess risks. It challenges auditors to change the way they think about assessing fraud risks. Auditors should identify risks and synthesize how those risks could lead to a material misstatement. This section specifically requires that improper revenue recognition and management override of controls be considered.\n\nSAS 99 provides specific examples of programs and controls for both large and small businesses. The auditor should consider which controls mitigate the identified fraud risks.\n\nThe standard provides examples of conditions that may be identified during the audit that might indicate fraud. One example is management denying the auditors access to key IT operations staff including security, operations, and systems development personnel. The auditors must determine whether the results of their tests affect their assessment.\n\nThe standard requires that any evidence that fraud may exist must be communicated to management and others. The level of severity is insignificant.\n\nSAS 99 significantly extends the documentation requirements of the previous standard. Auditors must document: (1) how and when the brainstorming session occurred and who participated, (2) procedures performed to obtain information to identify and assess fraud risk, (3) specific risks of material misstatement due to fraud (must specifically include discussion of revenue recognition) and the auditor's response to those risks, (4) results of the procedures performed to address the risk of management override of controls, (5) conditions and analytical relationships that led to additional audit procedures or other responses, and (6) nature of communications about fraud made to management and others.\n\nThe primary criticism of the standard is that many procedures are suggested rather than required. For example, it is suggested that auditors consider surprise procedures like showing up unannounced for an inventory count. In actual practice auditors often tell clients which inventory locations they are going to 'observe.' Telling clients which locations are going to be audited makes it easier to commit inventory fraud.\nA similar criticism is that SAS 99 doesn't close expectation gaps. The guidelines and suggestions provided in the standard increase expectations on the profession. As a result, auditors must consider the requirements of SAS 99 as the minimum level of work required to detect fraud. They must be prepared to defend any decision not to pursue one of the recommended procedures listed in SAS 99.\n\n\nInformation Technology Audit\n\n"}

The verse occurs in where John the Baptist is berating the Pharisees and Sadducees. He has previously called them a brood of vipers and warned them of the wrath to come and has urged them to repent. In this verse he warns that their links to Abraham will not save them\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:9.\n\nFrance does not believe that John the Baptist was attacking them for their reliance on bloodlines, rather he sees the phrase \"Abraham for our father\" as a reference to the exalted position within the political and religious hierarchy that the Pharisees and Sadducees felt would guarantee their salvation. This links with the overall theme of John's preaching that true repentance is the only path to salvation. Jesus uses the same reference to attack hypocrites in -.\n\nA second interpretation is that John is rejecting the then popular notion of \"merits of the fathers\" or Zekhut Avot. This principle was that because of the righteousness of Abraham and the other patriarchs, all Jews were now the chosen people and could count on goodwill from God. John is saying that no such lineage would save them from judgement. The reference to creating new children of Abraham out of stone is an illustration of God's omnipotence and that he has no need for his current worshipers.\n\nThe \"raising up of children to Abraham from these stones\" is generally seen as wordplay as in Hebrew the word for stones is \"abanim\" and children is \"banim\". France also believes the line is a reference to - which calls Abraham \"the rock from which you were hewn.\"\n\n"}

In 2006, the stadium was upgraded with artificial turf and track to match the other district high schools. Over the summers of 2014 and 2015, a group of Tesoro students painted most of the school hallways, themed by subject and adding a unique, vibrant mood to the walls.\n\nTesoro High School has 20 portable classrooms that have been placed on what used to be a blacktop and basketball court. This is an attempt to deal with the overcrowding at Tesoro. This is the third lowest amount of portables of the district's high schools after Capistrano Valley and San Juan Hills. Tesoro has 193, in permanent buildings and 19, in portable buildings. A two-story building is expected to replace the portables in Fall 2016 or 2017. There is 212, in all on the campus.\n\nIn 2009, Tesoro High School's mock trial team won the Constitutional Rights Foundation's Orange County Mock Trial Competition for the first time in school history. The team defeated Woodbridge High School, and proceeded to the state finals competition in San Jose, CA. In 2005 and 2011, they were county finalists, losing to Woodbridge in the finals on both occasions. In 2012, Tesoro's mock trial team once again made it to county finals, but lost to Saddleback Christian Academy.\n\nAs of 2014, Tesoro has over 75 clubs, in addition to chapters of the National Honor Society, California Scholarship Federation, and Impact Freshman Transition Program. All extracurricular activities, including dances and graduation, are under the direction of the Associated Student Body.\n\n\nIn 2005, two star football players, Scott McKnight and Sam Smith, were expelled for writing explicit and graphic death threats that involved sexual actions. The students wrote the journals for a class assignment that the teacher, to whom they were referring, collected and then promptly notified school officials.\n\nOn June 19, 2008 it was reported that two students, Omar Khan and Tanvir Singh, broke into the school to steal tests and change their own, and others' grades, by hacking into the school's computer network. Both students were charged with multiple felony violations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954622", "title": "Mekere Morauta", "text": "Mekere Morauta\n\nSir Mekere Morauta, KCMG (born 12 June 1946) is a Papua New Guinean economist and political figure. He was Prime Minister from 1999-2002. Mekere Morauta is also the most important opposition politician when not in office. His opposition against the O’Neill/Abel government was a major factor in the change of government. However this did not result in gaining office in the Marape government. He lost with 8 votes against 101 votes for James Marape in June 2019 \nSir Mekere was born in 1946 in Kukipi, a coastal village east of Kerema in the Gulf Province of Papua New Guinea. He was educated at local primary schools, at Kerema High and at Sogeri National High. He went on to study at the University of Papua New Guinea, where he obtained a Bachelor of Economics in 1970. He was also an exchange student at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nAfter graduating from university he worked as an economist in both the public and private sectors. In 1975 he was the first Papua New Guinean to be appointed Secretary of the Department of Finance, a position which he held until 1982. Other positions he has held include Managing Director of the government's commercial bank, the Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (1983–1992), and Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea (July 1993 – September 1994), PNG's central bank. Morauta was also a successful businessman after he retired from governing the central bank. From 1994 to 1997, he was executive chairman of Morauta Investments, Ltd. (Delta Seafoods and Morauta and Associates). After entering politics he withdrew from actively managing the firm and his wife Lady Roslyn Morauta took over the management of his businesses. Sir Mekere was a member of the so-called \"Gang of Four\", a group of influential young civil service chiefs who played a leading role in holding together public administration and public policy in the formative decade or so after Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975. The other members of the group were Charles Lepani, Sir Rabbie Namaliu and Sir Anthony Siaguru. Namaliu also later went on to become Prime Minister. Morauta maintained from that period on a strong professional and warm personal relationship with the Australian economist Ross Garnaut.\n\nSir Mekere entered the national parliament in July 1997 as the member for Moresby North-West. He was in 1998/99 Minister for Fisheries in the government of Bill Skate that emerged from the 1997 elections. The Skate government did not cope with the economic and political crises that beset PNG then and the government was defeated in a vote of no confidence. Sir Mekere was then, in July 1999 elected by parliament as Prime Minister with a huge majority : 99 votes for Sir Mekere and 5 votes for his challenger. His government was a reforming government and developed policies to deal with the crises. Sir Mekere was reelected in Moresby North West in 2002 and 2007. However he was manoeuvered out of government by Sir Michael Somare after the 2002 elections., Somare's National Alliance Party (NA) was the biggest party with 19 out of the 109 seats as compared to 12 for Mekere's People's Democratic Movement. Somare excluded Morauta in the coalition building after the elections and Morauta became leader of the opposition.However he was also deposed from that post by a coup within his party and spent 2004-2207 on the government bench. This is in PNG distinct from being in government. He was in government again in the period of the 2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis. Morauta was then Minister for Public Enterprises in the Peter O'Neill/Belden Namah cabinet that was formed in 2011 after a vote of no confidence made an end to the Somare/Abal government. In May 2012 he announced that, after fifteen years in Parliament, he would not stand for re-election and so left Parliament in June 2012 However, he became during the O’Neil/Leo Dion government in the period 2012–2017 a player in major controversies. This resulted in calls on him to stand again. He decided therefore to give in to major pressures and stood again successfully in Moresby North-West in 2017.\n\nHe joined parliament in 1997 as a member of the People's Democratic Movement (PDM). PDM was founded by Paias Wingti who lost his seat in the 1997 election and Morauta became the party leader. During his time as Prime Minister, between 1999 and 2002, Morauta was also leader of the PDM. When Michael Somare took over as Prime Minister after the 2002 general elections, it was expected that Morauta would be leader of the opposition. However, he was challenged from within his own party by John Muingnepe, the deputy leader of the party. Muingnepe dismissed Morauta as leader of the party in favor of Paias Wingti who had had succeeded to return to parliament in 2002. PDM split then into two groups. After being deposed as leader Morauta left to form his own party, the Papua New Guinea Party. Morauta had advocated already to change of name of PMD to indicating a fresh start. Morauta was installed as leader of the opposition after a successful appeal to the Registrar of Political Parties and the Ombudsman Commission against the actions of Muingnepe. He did however not manage to gain acceptance among his colleagues in the opposition and therefore became part of the government bench. After the 2007 election, he became again leader of the opposition until he joined the O'Neill/Namah government in 2011. He stood as an independent in the 2017 election. Morauta then joined the ranks of the Pangu Pati under the leadership of Sam Basil together with 4 other Independent MP's. This did not last long: the Pangu Pati joined the government bench and Morauta was again an independent. Party identification and formation is not a determinant factor in PNG politics: coalition building is crucial. Morauta is a politician who as a strong regional base in Gulf and Western province because of the economic importance of his fishing interests as well as the benefits brought by the Ok Tedi mine. He has also a solid base in Port Moresby. He was elected four times in the same constituency. However, power eludes him often because of difficulties in forging coalitions.\n\nThe Morauta government was in office from 14 July 1999 till 5 August 2002 and deployed far reaching initiatives. The most urgent task when coming to power was macro economic stabilization . Morauta looked back with satisfaction in his last budget speech before the election in 2002 on lower interest rates, lower inflation and a more stable currency. This had been achieved with the support of the International Financial Institutions and the Australian government. Second, the financial structure of PNG was reformed. The independence of the Central Bank was restored and reinforced. The government withdrew from the banking sector. Government used to be a major player in the banking sector through the Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (PNGBC). This bank was privatised. The state owned enterprises (SOES) were brought together under a holding company called the Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC). This was supposed to be a shell company that refrained as much as possible from direct management of the businesses under its control. Its core function was to stimulate the privatisation of SOES and managing the dividends that came from those enterprises. Thirdly there were major political reforms aimed at strengthening party formation. MPs used to shift allegiances easily and created therefore political instability. The Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC) had as its main provision that MPs had to remain loyal to the Prime Minister they had chosen whether they had supported the PM on a party platform or as independents. It proscribed crossing the floor on virtual all issues. It also laid down a framework for the organisation and registration of political parties. Similarly the electoral system was changed from a First Past the Post system to a system of Limited Preferential Voting. The idea was that candidates under such a system would approach other candidates searching for support in voters casting second or more preferences. This would stimulate cooperation between candidates and encourage stable party formation. Fourthly, government involvement in the natural resources sector was reorganised. Previous governments had involved themselves more and more with managing such resources through equity participation. Orogen Minerals Ltd was the major vehicle to bring government and private investment together in natural resources projects. The Morauta government sold the government's 51% controlling interest in Orogen to Oil Search Ltd. Government withdrew therefore from direct management and was merely drawing dividends from Oil Search. A different vehicle was created for the big Ok Tedi mine in Western Province. BHP was the controlling interest and manager of this mine. A tailings dam broke and BHP was faced with big claims of environmental damages. BHP wanted to avoid these and these were settled by transferring their shares to an entity representing the people of Western Province : the Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Fund. Income from these shares was used for development projects in Western province and Papua New Guinea as a whole. However, one third of that income was paid in a trust account in Singapore as a reserve for the people in Western Province when the mine would be exhausted. The Mineral Resources Development Corporation (MRDC) remained in existence. It was originally also a vehicle for government equity participation. However, its mission was limited when Orogen was established. MRDC's task was merely to administer the equity interest of landowner groups and provincial governments in natural resources projects.\n\nThe Morauta government faced stiff opposition after the first benefits of macro economic stabilization were realized and economic reforms were on the table. This opposition was primarily directed against austerity and privatization demanded by the International Financial Institutions and the Australian government. Soldiers rebelled when a report was leaked proposing the cutailment of the army and even merging it with the police into a mere paramilitary force. Soldiers protested not only against these plans but also strongly against the terms of retrenchment. A widespread protest movement of soldiers, workers and especially students emerged against the influence of the World Bank, IMF and the Australian government. During student protests against the privatizations in 2001, three students were shot dead by police. At a meeting with the parents of a dead student, Sir Mekere referred to the previous loss of his son and he described the events as “the blackest day in our nation's history. Morauta entered the elections of 2002 as a highly respected reformer, but this did not find favor with the voters. His PMD party declined from 42 seats to 17 seats. The National Alliance Party had fought a hard campaign against privatization and won the largest number of seats and therefore could invite the prime minister. Michael Somare succeeded in bringing together a large coalition of 88 votes in the 106 parliament. The PDM party boycotted this election. Somare put further privatisations on hold but he did not backtrack on the reforms that had already been implemented.\n\nThe long lasting beneficial effects of the reforms by the Morauta cabinet were most clearly felt in the macro economic situation. The Bank of PNG could operate independently of political influence and this was especially felt in debt management. Public debt decreased from 72.3% in 2000 to 25.5% in 2010. External debt fell also spectacularly from over 50% of GDP in 2000 to just 10% in 2010. The decade 2000–2010 was in contrast to the decade of 1990–2000 characterized by a stable currency (kina), low and stable inflation and a sharp decline in interest rates. Prime Minister Michael Somare, left the reforms of the Morauta government intact and could benefit from those.A fiscally conservative attitude of the Somare government as well as high commodity prices in the second half of the decade were important as well \nThe political reforms left a much more mixed legacy. The Somare government that followed the Morauta government was the first PNG government that made a full term. The increased stability in political life seems at first sight to be due to the reforms. However, closer inspection makes this doubtful. The reforms did not lead to a decrease in the number of parties or the emergence of policy driven parties. PNG politics remained dominated by opportunistic diverse coalitions. The ban on switching allegiance to a particular prime minister did not work, if only because the prime minister switched seeking support. The increased stability is in the first place due to organizational arrangements in parliament: first, a long grace period during which votes of no-confidence are not allowed and second, scheduling sessions advantageously for the government due to a coalition between the speaker of parliament and the prime minister. Finally, the Supreme Court considered in 2010 the provisions in OLIPAC contrary to the freedoms guaranteed in the constitution.\nThe third set of reforms : privatization and regulating income from natural resources became the major issue in the opposition by Sir Mekere. The reorganization of the natural resources sector by the Morauta government led to a stable income from the sector. Rent from Natural Resources provided in the decade 2000–2010 a large share of GDP: on average 45.74% as compared to an average of 28.9% in the whole period 1970–2014. However, the Somare governments returned to increased state intervention in the sector through equity participation. This gave rise to opposition by Morauta. Sir Mekere Morauta gave himself a review of the achievements of that cabinet when departing from politics in 2012 and stressed that the reforms were incomplete: much work still needed to be done..\n\nMekere Morauta had the same two crucial concerns in the variety of political positions he had between 2002 and 2017. Primary and above all, he was concerned about the concentration of power in PNG. He protested against the emasculation of parliament and the rise of politically sanctioned economic power outside parliament. He advocated as much privatisation as possible and when there was government ownership he pleaded for a maximum distance between politics/government and the enterprises involved. There should be as little opportunity as possible for sticky fingers in the government pie. This was linked to his second major concern: the management of PNG's natural resources and especially government participation in such projects.From 2012 onwards his criticism of the governance of the O\"Neill broadened: he became increasingly pessimistic about the economy as a whole.\nThe power of parliament: Somare proposed immediately after the defeat of Morauta in 2002 an extension of the grace period for the government in power from 18 months to 36 months. During the grace period no-confidence motions cannot be tabled. Parliament rejected this proposal twice but government did not relent. Morauta challenged this attempt to ignore parliament before the courts. There were various attempts at votes of no confidence when the grace period of this Somare government ended in 2004. Morauta was not active in these and this has to be seen in the light of being ousted from the post of leader of the opposition. In response to being slighted by the opposition, he joined the government bench. After the elections in 2007 he returned as leader of the opposition and the concentration of power outside parliamentary control became a main theme. He protested against granting IPBC power to raise loans outside the normal controls of the Ministry of finance and the Central Bank. The Minister, Arthur Somare, was securing loans in Abu Dabi just by himself. He strongly objected against further concentration of power when Arthur Somare was appointed as Minister of Finance on top of his appointment as Minister for Public Corporations. When the grace period ended in 2009 Morauta actively proposed a vote of no confidence in 2009. This was blocked by the speaker resorting to procedural matters such as leaving the issue in committee through adjournment. This resistance was overcome in 2011 and the Speaker allowed a no confidence vote. The Abal government was brought down. Abal was a caretaker while Michael Somare was in hospital in Singapore.. Morauta became Minister of Public enterprises in the O’Neil/Namah government that succeeded the Abal government. Morauta charged Arthur Somare, his predecessor, in that position, with bad management, corruption and theft. The loss of parliamentary oversight and ignoring the parliamentary approved legal framework was crucial in these criticisms: “The failure of Public Enterprises to obtain legally required approvals has played a significant role in their financial decline and in substantial costs to the taxpayer. The old IPBC had become a secretive, unaccountable organisation that disregarded due process.” ) At the time when Morauta decided to return to politics in 2016/2017, the same criticisms returned: “The National Parliament is in danger of becoming a rubber stamp for the decisions taken by the Prime Minister, surrounded by a small group of unelected advisers, high-priced foreign consultants and vested interests. In recent years the Office of the Prime Minister and those who influence it have come to dominate the structures and processes of decision-making by the Parliament and the Executive,” \nThe management of natural resources: When Morauta left office in 2012 there was no government holding company specifically for natural resources projects. Morauta's policy was that there should be an arms length distance between the management of enterprises and the government. The independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) supervised all the enterprises in which the government participated and a minister was in charge of that company. It was definitely not meant to be involved in direct management, Arthur Somare changed that policy when he was Minister of Public Corporations. He established Petromin which was meant to be more than merely a holding company: the management of natural resources moved out of the mere control of IPBC. Government went into business.\n\nThe IPIC loan. Arthur Somare, then niminster of public enterprises, wanted to promote government's shareholding in enterprises in line with that policy . This became an urgent concern in the LNG/PNG gas project. Government was facing a cash call, but it had no money. Therefore, he financed the acquisition of equity in LNG/PNG through a loan from the International Petroleum Investment Corporation (IPIC) in Abu Dhabi. Government income therefore became dependent upon profit and a change in taxation led to more dependence upon profit instead of income or output.\nArthur Somare only maintained corporation tax -a tax on profits-and waived income tax, GST and withholding tax for LNG. Mekere Morauta as leader of the opposition protested strongly in 2002 against this loss of revenue for the government of PNG, Morauta protested as well against the loan from the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Abu Dhabi (IPIC). The loan from IPIC was secured through the government interest in enterprises under PNG's Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC). Moreover, IPIC got the option to be repaid by the government shareholding in Oil Search plus the amount that the value of the shares would fall short of the amount loaned at the time of redemption. In the meantime government had to pay interest on the loan. Morauta considered the arrangement risky as government could loose valuable assets and he also considered it unwise as it had to be repaid before the income stream from LNG PNG was available to service the loan. He proved right. The PNG government could not service the loan and the shares plus the difference between the value of the shares and the loan went to IPIC.\nOkTedi and SNDP Morauta's decision to leave politics in 2012 was stymied by the decision of prime minister O’Neil to nationalise without compensation the Ok Tedi mine and the majority owner of the mine: Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Program (PNGSDP) The mine was according to O’Neil run for the benefit of foreigners and local people still suffered from the environmental problems under the new ownership that should have tackled these. O’Neill declared as an opening shot the chairman of the Ok Tedi board, the economist Ross Garnaut, a friend of Morauta, a prohibited immigrant. Morauta proposed that the government should pay compensation for the mine to the SNDP. The SNDP was according to him owned by the people of Western Province, O’Neill refused and took possession of the mine. Morauta divested as much as possible the assets of PNGSDF within PNG and distributed this in Western Province, The external fund of PNGDSP to the tune of US$1,5 billion was located in Singapore and therefore out of reach for the O’Neil government. That fund was meant to be used for projects when the mine was exhausted and was under control of Morauta. The fund became subject of protracted legal battles; Morauta as chairman of PNGSDP embarked on a case for arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington. PNGSDP requested a restitution of the shares taken by government, The case was not considered admissible to the court of arbitration because the government of PNG had not assented to the arbitration. The PNGSDP started at the same time a court case at the Supreme Court in Singapore protesting against the government's removal of directors and its chairman, Morauta. The PNG government retaliated with a case in the High Court in Singapore alleging misappropriation of funds in PNGSDP . The claim of misappropriation was thrown out. However the High Court in Singapore gave government representatives as directors the right to inspect the books of PNGSDP. The government appealed. Morauta started two cases within the PNG court system. In one case it sought the rights of PNGSDP to dividends from the OkTedi mine. Morauta has as well started a court case as a private citizen in the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea challenging the constitutionality of the Act appropriating the OKTedi mine. It was decided that he had no standing in the case: the case had to be brought by the company PNGSDP. That company has been taken over by the government and can therefore not be plaintiff and defendant at the same time Production and profitability at the mine dropped significantly after nationalisation. This is also caused by climatological factors, but for Morauta the cause is in the first place in the management: “They show that a well-managed and very profitable company under PNGSDP’s majority ownership has been turned into a corporate disaster under Mr O’Neill, as I predicted,” Sir Mekere said. The Singapore high court came to a verdict on the ownership of PNGSDP in April 2019. The judge produced a 149 page judgment in which it considered the reasoning of the government compelling but wanting in one crucial respect: there was no evidence to back up the argument. Prime Minister Peter O’Neil announced immediately to appeal against the ruling. The change of government in 2019 brought no difference in the government’s position. The new prime minister, James Marape, travelled very soon after taking power to Singapore in an attempt to take control over the fund. He intended to avoid the courts and hoped to put pressure on those professionals who managed the fund. He was accompanied by politicians from Western province. The latter take an ambiguous position: they welcomed the Singapore ruling and asked at the same time to bring the management of the fund back to PNG.\n\nThe UBS loan. The government of PNG had thus lost the shares in OilSearch in exchange for shares in LNG/PNG. The PNG government made however an agreement with Oil Search that it could buy shares from an expanded share capital. UBS Australia loaned the government of PNG $A 1.3 billion in 2013 to buy a ten percent share in Oil Search. Oil Search wanted to use that money to buy a participation in the next big gas development, the Elk/Antelope field. The PNG government wanted to service the loan from UBS through the proceeds from the previous gas field, the LNG/PNG project. The loan was secured by a claim on the government's Oil Search shares. Morauta did not comment immediately after the loan was made. However, in October 2015 when maturity of the loan was nearing, he asked together with the ex-prime minister Michael Somare for more transparency and information on the loan. The loan was according to them illegal and posed a danger to the PNG economy. The PNG government failed to repay when the loan matured in mid 2016. When te loan matured, it was refinanced but its ultimate fate was reached in 2017. The government lost in that process the shares in Oil Search and a big sum of money Mekere Morauta as MP asked for a full government enquiry after the termination of the loan agreement: Prime Minister O’Neil and Oil Search Manager Peter Botten should testify.Prime minister Marape has installed a Commission of inquiry under the leadership of the chief justice and with the head of the anti corruption Task force Sweep as council. Its brief is limited to the legality of the events and it has to report within three months.\n\nThe hopes on a PNG Sovereign Wealth Fund was essential in Morauta's analysis of the economy. Proceeds from the gas fields should be channelled into a Sovereign Wealth Fund under mixed government and private sector management dedicated to building and maintaining infrastructure. Such hopes appear idle after these debacles.\n\nSir Mekere Morauta is a highly praised and at the same time controversial politician. It is logical that his political opponents, for example Arthur Somare and Peter O’Neil do not appreciate his ideas. However, the criticism of Morauta is broader. For example: Mao Zeming, who was his deputy prime minister between 1999 and 2002 was highly critical when Morauta reentered politics. Zeming queried the successes of the Morauta government as well as his leadership.\n\nIn 1990 Morauta was made a Knight Bachelor. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nSir Mekere is married to Lady Roslyn Morauta, an economist and had a previous marriage with Louise Morauta, an anthropologist. James Morauta, a philosophy lecturer in Adelaide is the surviving son from the first marriage.\n"}

A number of Jews had joined the NSB, which initially was not antisemitic. Once war broke out that changed, and all Jews were removed from NSB ranks. Villa Bouchina, the parsonage, had become temporarily empty when Rev. J.TH. Meesters was taken to camp Amersfoort on 11 September 1942 for his participation in the Dutch resistance, where he was executed on 15 October 1942. They had a cleaning lady as well as a cook. There were no guards. Despite them having been removed from the NSB, their original membership marked them as traitors. On April 21, these Jews were taken to Camp Theresienstad. They lived in Villa Bouchina not because they were of particular interest to the Dutch non-existing government or the Germans, but because they were under the direct protection of Anton Mussert. Mussert was executed in 1946.\n\nThe reservation camp was part of Plan Frederiks. The idea was to protect certain Jews who had been and would be beneficial to the Netherlands.

In this context, the lengthened vowel in words such as \"bath\", \"laugh\", \"grass\", \"chance\" in accents affected by the split is referred to as a broad A (also, in the UK, long A). Phonetically, the vowel is in Received Pronunciation (RP); in some other accents, including Australian and New Zealand accents, it is a fronter vowel ( or ), and it tends to be a rounded and shortened in Broad South African English. A split also occurs in the accents of the Middle Atlantic United States (New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia accents), but it results in very different vowel qualities to the aforementioned British-type split and so, to avoid confusion, is usually referred to in American linguistics as a 'short-\"a\" split'.\n\nIn accents unaffected by the split, words like \"bath\", \"laugh\", etc. usually have the same vowel as words like \"cat\", \"trap\", \"man\": the short A or flat A. Similar changes took place in words with ; see \"lot–cloth\" split.\n\nThe sound change originally occurred in southern England, and ultimately changed the sound of to in some words in which the former sound appeared before , leading to RP for \"path\" and for \"sample\", etc. The sound change did not occur before other consonants; thus accents affected by the split preserve in words like \"cat\". (See the section below for more details on the words affected.) The lengthening of the \"bath\" vowel began in the 17th century but was 'stigmatised as a Cockneyism until well into the 19th century'.\n\nThe presence or absence of this split is one of the most noticeable differences between different accents of English English. An isogloss runs across the Midlands from the Wash to the Welsh border, passing to the south of the cities of Birmingham and Leicester. North of the isogloss, the vowel in most of the affected words is usually the same short-\"a\" as in \"cat\"; south of the isogloss, the vowel in the affected words is generally long.\n\nThere is some variation close to the isogloss; for example in the dialect of Birmingham (the so-called 'Brummie') most of the affected words have a short-\"a\", but \"aunt\" and \"laugh\" usually have long vowels. Additionally, some words which have in most forms of American English, including \"half\", \"calf\", \"rather\", and \"can't\", are usually found with long vowels in the Midlands and Northern England.\n\nIn northern English dialects, the short A is phonetically , while the broad A varies from to ; for some speakers, the two vowels may be identical in quality, differing only in length ( vs ). John Wells has claimed that Northerners who have high social status may have a split and has posted on his blog that he grew up with the split in Upholland, Lancashire. AF Gupta's study of students at the University of Leeds found that (on splitting the country in two halves) 93% of northerners used in the word 'bath' and 96% of southerners used . However, there are areas of the Midlands where the two variants co-exist and, once these are excluded, there were very few individuals in the north who had a trap–bath split (or in the south who did not have the split). Gupta writes, 'There is no justification for the claims by Wells and Mugglestone that this is a sociolinguistic variable in the north, though it is a sociolinguistic variable on the areas on the border [the isogloss between north and south]'.\n\nIn some West Country accents of English English where the vowel in \"trap\" is realised as rather than , the vowel in the \"bath\" words was lengthened to and did not merge with the of \"father\". In those accents, \"trap\", \"bath\", and \"father\" all have distinct vowels , , and ..\n\nIn Cornwall, Bristol (as well as towns around Bristol), and in many forms of Scottish English, there is no distinction corresponding to the RP distinction between and .\n\nIn Received Pronunciation (RP), the trap–bath split did not happen in all eligible words. It is hard to find a clear rule for the ones that changed. Roughly, the more common a word the more likely that the change from flat to broad took place. It also looks as if monosyllables were more likely to change than polysyllables. The change very rarely took place in open syllables, except where closely derived from another word with . Thus \"passing\" is closely derived from \"pass\", and so has broad A : \"passage\" is not so closely derived, and thus has flat A . Here is the set of words that underwent transition, and counterexamples with the same environment:\n\nFor the words in the last row, subsequent sound changes have altered the conditions initially responsible for lengthening\n\nThere are some words in which both pronunciations are heard among southern speakers:\n\n\nUse of broad A in \"mass\" is distinctly conservative and rare now: other international fluctuations are both common, but with further complications.\n\nWhile \"graph, telegraph, photograph\" can have either (now in Received Pronunciation, they have broad A), \"graphic\" and permutations always have a flat A.\n\nBroad A fluctuates in dialects that include it; before \"s\" it is a more common alternative when in its common voiceless variant ( rather than ) (in \"transfer\" , \"transport\" and variants) than when it is voiced (thus \"translate\" , \"trans-Atlantic\" ).\n\nSome research has concluded that many people in the North of England have a dislike of the vowel in words. AF Gupta writes, 'Many of the northerners were noticeably hostile to , describing it as \"comical\", \"snobbish\", \"pompous\" or even \"for morons\".' Whilst writing on a Labovian study of speech in West Yorkshire, K. M. Petyt wrote in 1985 that several respondents 'positively said that they did not prefer the long-vowel form or that they really detested it or even that it was incorrect'. However, Joan Beal said in a 1989 review of Petyt's work that those who disliked the pronunciation still associated it with the BBC and with the sort of professional jobs that they would aspire to.\n\nEvidence for the date of the shift comes from the Southern Hemisphere accents, those of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\nIn Australian English, there is generally agreement with southern British in words like \"path, laugh, class\". However, with the exception of South Australian English, before or , such as \"dance, plant, example\", most Australians use a flat A; the words \"aunt, can't, shan't\", are invariably pronounced with a broad A. Phonetically, the broad A is . In Australia there is variation in the word \"castle\", both pronunciations are commonly heard. For more information, see the table at Variation in Australian English. In South Australian English the broad A is usually used.\n\nSouth African and New Zealand English have a distribution of sounds similar to that of RP.\n\nMost accents of American English and Canadian English are unaffected by the split. The main exceptions are parts of New England (\"see Boston accent\") and in the Plantation South, where the broad sound can be used in some of the same words as in southern England, such as \"aunt, ask, bath\" etc. ('Aunt', though, is unique, as the broad-a pronunciation is found sporadically throughout the US, not only in New England.) By the early 1980s, the broad was in decline in New England.\n\nRelated, but distinct, phenomena include the following:\n"}

Jansen won 65 international caps with the Netherlands national football team and played in the Dutch teams that reached the 1974 and 1978 World Cup Finals.\n\nHe spent most of his playing career with his hometown team, Feyenoord, between 1965 and 1980. At Feyenoord, Jansen won four League Championships, one Dutch Cup, one UEFA Cup in 1974, and the European Cup in 1970 when Feyenoord defeated Celtic 2–1 in Milan.\n\nJansen signed for the American side Washington Diplomats in 1980, but after playing 27 games for them, he returned to the Netherlands to sign for Ajax, on the advice of Johan Cruyff, who played together with Jansen at the Washington Diplomats.\n\nJansen would play as libero and fill a gap in the Ajax defence after the departure of Ruud Krol in the summer of 1980. By November 1980, after 13 rounds of the Eredivise Ajax were 8th, by the end of the season they had picked up form and finished as runners-up behind AZ and in front of FC Utrecht. The next season Ajax went on to win the Eredivisie with Jansen in the team. Feyenoord fans didn't like former player Jansen playing for their main rivals Ajax. On his Ajax debut (which, incidentally, was away to Feyenoord. Ajax lost 4–2) a snowball was thrown at his eye and Jansen had to leave the field for treatment. Jansen stayed at Ajax until summer 1982 when he retired at age 35.\n\nHe began his management career at his old club Feyenoord, where he worked as a coach, and then as assistant manager, between 1983 and 1987. After a season as manager of Belgian club SC Lokeren, he was appointed as Technical Director at second division SVV, where he won the league alongside his manager – future Rangers manager Dick Advocaat.\n\nIn 1991, he returned to Feyenoord as manager, winning the Dutch Cup in 1991 and 1992 and taking them to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991–92. He became Technical Director in 1992, with Hans Dorjee being appointed as manager, but Dorjee became ill and Jansen took over as manager again. Dorjee later resigned and was replaced as manager by Jansen's old teammate, Willem van Hanegem. Feyenoord won the Dutch Championship in 1993 and the Dutch Cup again the following season, but after a dispute with the executives of the club, Jansen left to work as assistant manager of Saudi Arabia alongside Leo Beenhakker. Between 1994 and 1997 he also managed Japanese side Sanfrecce Hiroshima.\n\nOn 3 July 1997, Wim Jansen was appointed as head coach of Celtic, replacing the sacked Tommy Burns. He went on to guide them to their first Scottish league championship in 10 years, ending the hopes of rival Rangers to win a tenth consecutive championship. Despite winning the league and the Scottish League Cup during his only season in charge, Jansen left the club less than 48 hours after the title was secured due to an inability to work with general manager Jock Brown. His most notable transfer was the signing of Henrik Larsson from Feyenoord.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2008–09 season Jansen took up the position of assistant to the head coach of the Feyenoord first team, Gertjan Verbeek.\n\nWim Jansen has lived in Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht since the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The song describes the legendary river in a poetic and nostalgic way, that it is surrounded by mountains, its sources are near the city of Surakarta, that it ends in the sea, and that the merchants use it. Many versions of the songs in different languages exist.\n\nWritten in 1940 by Gesang Martohartono, it is in the local kroncong style, a popular folk style with influences from Portuguese.\n\nThe song's widespread popularity began soon after its composition. Locally it is strongly associated with the Japanese occupation and the society of the time. In 1940 Gesang, then a young, destitute and untrained musician, composed \"Bengawan Solo\" on a bamboo flute and began to sing it at local functions and gatherings in his hometown of Surakarta. It soon became well-known, and the song then achieved national acclaim after it was broadcast to a wider audience by radio stations.\n\nThe song was very popular with the Japanese who occupied the Indonesia during World War II. The soldiers brought \"Bengawan Solo\" home with them to Japan after the war. There, and in the rest of Asia and later worldwide, the song became very famous. In 1991, a group of appreciative Japanese war veterans arranged for a statue of Martohartono to be erected in a park in Surakarta. Gesang himself was still resident in the city, now a nationally renowned figure.\n\nIts melodies appealed to the occupying Japanese soldiers as well as the non-Indonesian prisoners (mainly Dutch civilians) in the internment camps. \"Bengawan Solo\" was taken back to Japan by the returning soldiers, where it (with the lyrics translated to Japanese) gained great popularity after singers such as Toshi Matsuda released recorded versions of it which became best-sellers. The song has become almost synonymous with the perception of Indonesian music in Japan.\n\nThe tune became a big hit among Chinese communities after Malaysian singer Poon Sow Keng sang it with Mandarin lyrics for Hong Kong Pathe in 1956. Its popularity was further boosted by Koo Mei, who made her rendition for Philips Records shortly thereafter. (Pathe and Philips were major competitors at that time.) Since then, many Chinese language singers have written their own lyrics for the tune, making it well known in Chinese oldies music.\n\nAn English version, titled \"By the River of Love\", was recorded by Rebecca Pan in from early 1960s Hong Kong. The lyrics describe a romantic evening beneath twinkling stars and swaying palms. The period recording by Rebecca Pan can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2000 movie \"In the Mood for Love\" by director Wong Kar-wai. Pan also has a role in the movie, playing Mrs. Suen.\n\nMany artistes have recorded \"Bengawan Solo\" in Indonesian, among whom are Waljinah, Anneke Grönloh, Frances Yip, P.Ramlee and Saloma.\n\n\n\n"}

Their home arena was Riverfront Coliseum, and they were the only major league hockey team based in Cincinnati.\n\nThe Stingers franchise was awarded in 1974 as part of the WHA's ill-conceived attempt at expansion. They entered the league for the 1975-76 season along with the Denver Spurs. Most of the league's existing teams were not financially stable, and franchise relocations were commonplace. Nonetheless, the Stingers achieved enough stability that they were the only one of the WHA's five expansion teams that lasted through the end of the league. However, they were left out of the WHA-NHL merger that took place in the summer of 1979. The WHA insisted on including all three of its surviving Canadian teams, though below-average attendance made it unlikely that the Stingers would have made the cut in any event. The Stingers, along with the Birmingham Bulls, were paid to disband when the WHA ceased operations.\n\nThe Stingers were the first professional team of long-time NHL stars Mike Gartner and Mike Liut, and the second pro team for Mark Messier. Messier was placed on a line with Robbie Ftorek, one of the top scorers in the league, but managed only one goal.\n\nAfter the WHA shut down, a minor professional version of the Cincinnati Stingers began the 1979–80 season in the Central Hockey League (CHL).

{"id": "1954673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954673", "title": "Denver Spurs", "text": "Denver Spurs\n\nThe Denver Spurs were a professional ice hockey team based out of Denver, Colorado. The Spurs began play in the Western Hockey League in 1968, and played at the Denver Coliseum. The Spurs became the first professional sports team in Colorado to win a championship in 1971–72. After the WHL folded in 1974, the team transferred to the Central Hockey League for the 1974–75 season.\n\nIn June, 1974, Ivan Mullenix, owner of the CHL Spurs, was awarded a \"conditional\" NHL franchise for the 1976-77 season. With the McNichols Sports Arena already complete by 1975, he looked to enter the NHL a year early, and the league attempted to broker an arrangement whereby Mullenix would acquire the California Golden Seals (then under league ownership) and move them to Denver in lieu of an expansion team. At the same time, the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins would be sold to a Seattle group who also held a conditional franchise, which would have been named the Seattle Totems.\n\nThe proposed arrangement fell through, and with the continuing franchise difficulties, the NHL called off the 1976-77 expansion. Mullenix accepted an offer from the WHA to join that league for the 1975-76 season. The Spurs were the second WHL refugee to join the WHA, following the Phoenix Roadrunners.\n\nThe WHA Spurs claimed most of the players in a dispersal draft from the Chicago Cougars, who had folded in 1975, and some players from the CHL Spurs were also retained.\n\nA \"Sports Illustrated\" preview on the upcoming WHA season noted that it was stalwart Gordie Howe's 28th year in major league hockey, and the Spurs' first. The magazine picked the expansion team to finish last in the WHA's Western Division. It also said that unless the Spurs drew well immediately, \"Denver's stay in big-league hockey could be exactly 27 years shorter than Gordie Howe's.\"\n\nThe Spurs' first exhibition game, against Howe's Houston Aeros, proved to be a microcosm of their brief stay in the WHA. No beer was available because Mullenix was unable to get a liquor license, there was no flag to face during the national anthem, and the scoreboards didn't work. Only 5,000 fans showed up. The situation didn't get much better during the regular season; they only averaged 3,000 fans in a 16,800-seat arena. The most widely cited reason for the poor attendance was hard feelings over being spurned by the NHL. Denver-area fans had been banking on an NHL team after three years of advertising and did not consider the WHA to be a major league.\n\nThe situation wasn't much better on the ice either. Veteran Ralph Backstrom was one of the Spurs' few experienced players, but at 38 his career was in decline. Still, he wound up leading the team with 50 points in 41 games. The rest of the roster was filled with cast-offs and career minor-leaguers, such as Don Borgeson, who had played for the WHL Spurs from 1971–73; he finished second to Backstrom in points scored with 41. They could never find an answer in goal; one of their goalies ran up a staggering 15.00 goals against average (GAA).\n\nThe Spurs played their first regular-season game at home against the Indianapolis Racers. Before only 5,000 fans, the Spurs scored the first goal, only to give up seven unanswered goals en route to a 7-1 loss. By December 30, they were in the Western Division cellar with a 13–20–1 mark, despite an overtime win over the Racers that night in Denver. It would turn out to be the last game the Spurs would play in Colorado.\n\nRumors had abounded even before the Spurs got on the ice that the NHL was planning to move either the Seals or the Kansas City Scouts to Denver. By late December, Mullenix got word that the Scouts were in very serious discussions about moving to Denver for the following season. Knowing he couldn't hope to compete with an NHL team, Mullenix began the process of selling the team to the \"Founders Club,\" a group of businessmen based in Ottawa, on New Year's Eve. He had initially begun negotiations with the Founders Club a month into the season when the first rumors cropped up of a Scouts move to Denver. Soon after Mullenix reopened the Ottawa feelers, the Founders Club insisted that Mullenix move the team to Ottawa immediately. In the middle of a road trip, Mullenix quietly moved the Spurs to Ottawa on January 2, 1976, where they were renamed the Ottawa Civics. The players reportedly only learned of the move to Ottawa when they stood on the ice in Cincinnati (in their Denver colors) and suddenly heard \"O Canada\" being played in honor of it being the national anthem of the nation of their new \"home city\". \n\nDespite playing to sellout crowds at two home games in Ottawa, Mullenix and the Founders Club were unable to reach a deal, and Mullenix was not willing to operate the team in Ottawa. Negotiations for the sale were called off on January 15, however, and the team folded for good two days later. The Spurs/Civics' 41-game existence made them easily the shortest-lived franchise in WHA history, and one of the shortest-lived franchises in North American professional sports history.\n\nThe Spurs' abrupt departure turned out to be a prescient move, as the Scouts indeed moved to Denver for the following season, becoming the Colorado Rockies. The Rockies only lasted six seasons, though, before relocating again and becoming the New Jersey Devils. It would not be until the relocation of the Quebec Nordiques (ironically, a former WHA franchise) to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 that Denver would enjoy lasting success in major league hockey.\n\nThe last active Spurs player in the NHL was Ron Delorme, who retired after the 1984-85 season. As well, Spurs draft pick Mel Bridgman played in the NHL until 1989, but never played in the WHA.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n"}

The team, which hastily adopted its identity in midseason when the Denver Spurs announced plans to sell the team and relocate to Ottawa, existed only for approximately two weeks, folding after only seven games.\n\nThe Denver Spurs began play in the Western Hockey League in 1968, and had been modestly successful in the minors before moving to the WHA in 1975. However, fans in Denver had been expecting an NHL team after Spurs owner Ivan Mullenix won a conditional NHL expansion franchise to begin play in 1976-77, only to see those plans fizzle out.\nThe Spurs were plagued by financial difficulties and poor attendance (less than 3,000 per game), widely attributed to the Denver fanbase rejecting the WHA as a minor league. However, they were also dogged by rumors that the NHL was planning to move either the Kansas City Scouts or the league-owned California Golden Seals to Denver; the Scouts would indeed eventually move to Denver as the Colorado Rockies in the 1976 offseason.

While the Spurs were on a road trip in January 1976, the team was quietly moved to Ottawa without even a press release and renamed the Civics. Allegedly, the players only learned of the move at their next road game that night in Cincinnati, when they stood on the ice in their Denver jerseys and suddenly heard \"O Canada\" being played. They lost that night and again the following night in Houston, then knocked off the Minnesota Fighting Saints (another squad headed for oblivion before the season was over) in Minnesota, 5-2, on January 4. It would be only victory in the Civics' short life.\n\nThe Civics played two home games at the Ottawa Civic Centre in front of sellout crowds–against the New England Whalers on January 7, and against Gordie Howe's Aeros on January 15. However, the Founders Club simply did not have the means nor the money to close the purchase, and Mullenix was not interested in operating a team in Ottawa. After the first home game, he gave the Founders Club an ultimatum–come up with $1.2 million within 10 days, or he would fold the team. When it was apparent that the money was not forthcoming, the Civics folded on January 17, 1976 after only playing 7 games as Ottawa.\n\nBecause of the rushed nature of the move, the Civics did not adopt a logo or colours, and continued to wear the Spurs' orange road uniforms for all 7 of their games including their two home games. Major league hockey would not return to Ottawa until the reborn Senators joined the NHL in the 1992-93 season. The last active Spurs/Civics player in the NHL was Ron Delorme, who retired after the 1984-85 season.\n\nThe Civics' 7-game, two-week existence made them easily the shortest-lived team in the WHA's seven-year history, and one of the shortest-lived teams to have ever played a major professional sport. Only the Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen, whose one week in the National Football League in 1921 stands as the current record, have a shorter known time span of existence. Combined with the 34 games played as the Spurs, the 41 games was also easily the shortest-lived franchise in WHA history.\n\n\"This listing includes 34 games played as the Denver Spurs.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n"}

In 2007, he became a member of the rock supergroup S.K.I.N. and in 2009 founded his own company, J-glam. He toured worldwide several times, with over 250 shows in 30 countries as of 2015. As of 2016, he released ten solo albums and 27 singles.\n\nIn 2014, Miyavi appeared in the motion picture \"Unbroken\", directed by Angelina Jolie and went on to undertake smaller roles in American productions such as \"\" and \"Stray\". Since 2013, Miyavi has been a volunteer at UNHCR, visiting refugee camps around the world. In November 2017, he was appointed an official Goodwill Ambassador.\n\nMiyavi was born in the Nishikujō district in Konohana-ku ward, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, to a Japanese mother and a Korean Japanese father. After the first grade, he moved to Kawanishi. His father's family, surnamed Lee, came from Jeju Island. Miyavi says that as a child he was a good student and enjoyed playing football. He was accepted into the junior team of Cerezo Osaka, a J-League team. In the second year of junior high school, a sports injury prevented him from pursuing a professional career in sports. Instead, at the age of fifteen, he learned to play the guitar. He bought a guitar and began covering songs by Ray Charles.\n\nHe was particularly fond of visual kei acts such as X Japan and Luna Sea but also listened to the blues, Motown, hard rock such as Metallica and L.A. Guns, and industrial music such as Nine Inch Nails. In his third year of junior high school, he started playing with his first band, a visual kei group named Loop.\n\nIn 1999, at the age of 17, Miyavi moved to Tokyo, and joined the visual kei rock band Dué le quartz, where he went by the stage name \"Miyabi\". Besides being a guitarist, he wrote lyrics, composed, and arranged. When the band split up in 2002, he started his solo career and changed his name to Miyavi. He signed a contract with the independent record label PS Company, and on October 31, his debut studio album \"Gagaku\" was released. Before the end of the year three more singles were released: \"Shindemo Boogie-Woogie\", \"Pop Is Dead\" and \"Jingle Bell\", of which only the third managed to enter the top forty on the Oricon charts.

In June his seventh single, \"Ashita, Genki Ni Naare\", was released, which charted twenty-second, and number one on the indies chart. In August a small, free, fan-club-only event was organized in Tokyo Dome, and on the 31st he held his last indie concert at the Nippon Budokan. In October, he signed a major contract with Universal Music Group, but was still co-managed by PS Company. This was followed by the release of his first major (double) single, \"Rock no Gyakushuu\"/\"21sekikei Koushinkyoku\", which entered the top ten on the charts.\n\nDuring May 2005 another single, \"Freedom Fighters -Icecream wo Motta Hadashi no Megami to, Kikanjuu wo Motta Hadaka no Ousama-\", was released, which charted tenth, and on June 1, his first major album, \"Miyavizm\", was released. It was his first album to enter the top ten in the charts. It was followed by the third major single, \"Kekkon Shiki Uta\"/\"Are You Ready to Rock?\", which is his best charting single, along with \"Dear My Friend\"/\"Itoshii Hito\", released in 2006; both reached number six. In December he performed at the first \"Peace & Smile Carnival\" organized by PS Company.\n\nIn late 2005 and for most of 2006, Miyavi shifted to an acoustic/pop sound reflected in his second and third major albums, \"MYV Pops\" and \"Miyaviuta: Dokusō\", released on August 2 and September 13 respectively. They charted at fifteenth and twenty-fifth. The first album singles, \"Señor Señora Señorita\"/\"Gigpig Boogie\" and \"Kimi ni Negai o\", are not different in style. They charted as tenth and twenty-sixth respectively. Miyavi showcased his new acoustic style for the first time in the \"25 Shūnen Kinen Koen\" concert series held at Tokyo Geijutsu Gekijo for five days in September around his 25th birthday. Miyavi left for America for the next six months to study the English language and take dance classes, and, on the weekends, went to Venice Beach and gave street performances.\n\nOn February 17, Miyavi, having been invited by the break dancer Mr. Freeze, performed with the local DJ and percussionist at his first solo concert in the United States, at the Tabu Ultra Lounge in the MGM Grand, Las Vegas.

It is his third single to enter the top ten. On March 19, his fourth major studio album was released, titled, \"This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock\", which charted as twenty-fifth. In May, it was followed by his very first worldwide tour, \"This Iz The Japanese Kabuki Rock Tour 2008\", with 33 concerts in the United States, Chile, Brazil, Germany, England, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Finland, France, Taiwan, South Korea, mainland China and Japan. The tour covered a distance of approximately 48,385 miles, equivalent to almost two trips around the world, and the majority of the concerts were sold out and covered extensively by media organizations. It was the most successful international tour undertaken by a Japanese artist in history. On June 27, a compilation album, \"Azn Pride -This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock-\", was released in Korea and Taiwan, later also in Japan, which charted as forty-fourth.

It is his best-selling album so far, reaching number eight on the Oricon charts. \n\nOn October 12, 2013, it was announced that Miyavi would venture into professional acting with his international debut in the film \"Unbroken\". He played the role of Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed \"The Bird\", in what was Angelina Jolie's second feature film as director. It was released in December 2014. Miyavi commented that as the movie was somewhat sensitive to the Japanese people, he had hesitated as to whether he should take this role. However, after meeting with Jolie, and given that the underlying theme of this story is forgiveness, he wholeheartedly decided to accept it. Miyavi was featured in the same month's edition of Vogue Italia.\n\nIn 2013 Miyavi was nominated for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Japanese Act, and at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan he won the Best Collaboration category with Yuksek.

New students with siblings that already attend SDA are automatically enrolled to the school.\n\nOne hallmark of a San Dieguito Union High School District academy is a \"4x4\" class schedule as opposed to a more traditional \"rotating block schedule\". This means that students may take four 90-minute classes every day during an 18-week course, completing eight classes (80 credits) a year.\n\nIn 1998, the school had roughly 1000 students, and by 2002, had 1500 (population limits of district high schools and academies are required to grow relative to the district).

These drivers provide printing services for Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS), RISC OS and Haiku.\n\nIt was originally developed as a plug-in for the GIMP, but later became a more general tool for use by other programs and operating systems (macOS and Windows). When Apple introduced Mac OS X, it omitted printer drivers, claiming that it was the printer manufacturer's task to produce these. Many of them did not update their drivers, and since Apple had chosen to use CUPS as the core of its printing system, Gimp-Print filled the void.\n\nGutenprint has more than 1,300 drivers for Apollo, Apple, Brother, Canon, Citizen, Compaq, Dai Nippon, DEC, Epson, Fujifilm, Fujitsu, Gestetner, HP, IBM, Infotec, Kodak, Kyocera, Lanier, Lexmark, Minolta, NEC, NRG, Oki, Olivetti, Olympus, Panasonic, PCPI, Raven, Ricoh, Samsung, Savin, Seiko, Sharp, Shinko, Sony, Star, Tally, Tektronix and Xerox printers.\n\nMany users incorrectly called it Gimp, so the software was renamed Gutenprint to clearly distinguish it from the GIMP. The name Gutenprint recognizes Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the movable type printing press.\n\nThe Epson backend is in active development; new printers, bug fixes and capability additions are contributed in each new release.\n\nThis backend is in active development, and new printers, bug fixes and capability additions are contributed in each new release.\nCanon printers use intelligent printheads, which control the quality of the final output given metadata sent to the printer from the driver. A consequence of this design is that the print quality is not specified in resolution alone, but via a \"resolution mode\" quality setting (up to 5 quality settings available at a time). The resolution parameter in the driver-output data is only a meta-resolution, typically either 300 or 600 dpi, sometimes 1200 dpi for certain monochrome or high-quality photo modes on a limited number of printers. The firmware then controls the printhead and creates physical ink output up to the marketed resolution.\n\nThe available quality selections depends on a number of parameters (as applicable): the media to be printed on, duplex or simplex, borderless or bordered, color or monochrome printing, inkset selection, and cartridge selection. Thus, there are a number of available \"resolution modes\" per media, some of which will be available depending on the other parameters set for the printjob.\n\nSince in gutenprint, all options are always available via the PPD, the driver attempts to select reasonable defaults in the cases where the user settings are in contradiction. The prioritization follows: media type, resolution mode, cartridge selection, inkset selection, duplex selection. When a parameter clash is detected by the driver, resolution mode and other parameters are set according to the priority above, and substitution of resolution mode carried out to try to maintain the required quality initially requested.\n\nBorderless selection, added in version 5.2.9, is currently not a part of the prioritization and replacement algorithm, as only a small number of printers have been analyzed to discover the appropriate modes and media for borderless printing.\n\nThe PCL, color laser, and Lexmark backends are currently unmaintained. Volunteers are welcome.\nFairly often, printers that would use these backends have emulation capability for other languages, in particular Postscript. In such a case, the printer can be configured to use a standard Postscript driver.\n\n\n"}

This origin is mentioned in a January 2006 episode of animated series \"The Boondocks\", \"The Itis\", in which the character Robert Freeman creates a restaurant which serves the burger.\n\nMulligan's, a suburban bar in Decatur, Georgia, serves the Luther Burger in addition to its \"hamdog\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that Mulligan's may be progenitor of the burger when the owner substituted the doughnuts when running out of buns.\n\nThe Gateway Grizzlies baseball team of Sauget, Illinois have served the Luther Burger at their ballpark. Their version consists of a deep-fried Krispy Kreme doughnut around a black Angus all-beef patty, melted cheese, and two strips of bacon. Dubbed a \"cardiologist's worst nightmare\", this burger is . Aside from bringing in revenue from sales, it has drawn more fans to come out to the ballpark: apparently, attendance at games has increased and the burger is one of the most popular aspects of the park.

The restaurateur added the burger to the menu after a friend experienced one while traveling through the Southern United States. Restaurant owner Firas Zabib has said he sells 10–20 of the burgers per day, and that his was the first shop in New York City to sell them.\nAround the United States, copies and variations of the Luther Burger have appeared at state fairs.

The Indiana vendor explained his impetus to sell the burger after seeing Paula Deen \"[do] it on TV\". The burger was described as having a salty-sweet taste, and surprisingly ungreasy. The \"Krispy Kreme Doughnut Burger\" as served at the 2010 Mississippi State Fair was garnished with \"lettuce, tomato and a generous slice of raw onion\", and was estimated to provide .

The network focused on music videos, which through a change in format in the early 1990s, were selected by viewer request via telephone; as such, unlike competing networks (such as MTV and VH1), the videos were not broadcast on a set rotation.\n\nThe network was distributed on cable and satellite providers, with additional carriage on over-the-air UHF television stations (mainly on low-power outlets); most of these stations, which later became affiliates of MTV2 following the shutdown of The Box's US Operations, have since been sold off as of 2012, while Viacom retains ownership of the other remaining former Box affiliates.\n\nThe Box's UK Operations remain on the air today, now owned by Channel 4.\n\nThe network originally launched as the Video Jukebox Network in 1985; it was founded by Steve Peters, who launched it on a television station in Miami, Florida. It was initially a product of the Miami Music scene, and was hosted by a group of local Miami Bass rappers known as Miami Boyz. Peters formed a record company called Peter's Records from the revenue earned by the Video Jukebox Network. Despite having his foot in the local Miami Bass scene, and employing hip-hop producers from abroad, none of its artists managed to produce a hit record; the label was shut down before Peters sold The Box to a group which included cable operator TCI and Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. Beginning in the early 1990s, the service – which eventually adopted the shortened name The Box – began allowing viewers to request videos through a designated telephone number; viewers would be directed to enter a code – which was displayed through an on-screen menu that aired full-screen between videos as well as in a text- and icon-only format on the lower third of the screen during a video broadcast – to request a recent or classic music video to air on the network (this format was reflected in the network's longtime slogan during the 1990s, \"Music Television You Control\").\n\nAt first, all of The Box's request lines used a large block of Miami telephone numbers and callers were only charged for a long-distance call; however, in order to gain revenue, the network switched to the request line to a 1-900 toll number, with callers being charged from $1.99 to $3.99 per call to make a request of up to three videos. The network was well known for being an \"underground\" outlet for music videos that were not shown or even banned on MTV, with up to 350 videos selectable at any given time in each of the 170 (by September 1992) different Box affiliates throughout the United States. Each affiliate had a unique playlist, usually customized to the local market, giving great exposure to more local and obscure groups.\n\nVideos cost between 99¢ and $3.99 and, on a national average, took around 20 minutes to be broadcast after being ordered; it was not uncommon for multiple videos to air in succession, nor was it for there to be a gap in videos for several minutes on end (during which time, the request menu was shown). Because the channel's playlist was totally controlled by viewers, anyone could request any video for as many times as they wanted (explaining why some new videos like Bone Thug's \"Crossroads\" could be seen ten times within an hour). The network was known for its rough-around-the-edges and \"bootleg\"-like feel, sometimes making it appear like it was of low quality. Despite this, The Box was known to have many popular videos appear in heavy rotation on The Box months before appearing on MTV – Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\" was seen on The Box many months before \"breaking out\" for example – and was largely responsible in raising the profile of acts such as Sir Mix-A-Lot and Green Jellÿ.\n\nIn May 1999, The Box was acquired by MTV Networks division of Viacom. The Box ceased operations in the United States just over 1½ years later on January 1, 2001, moving operations to the UK; MTV2, which featured a mix of set rotation and viewer request music video blocks at the time, replaced the network on its affiliates, before eventually withdrawing broadcast carriage of MTV2 in the 2010s to return to a cable-only distribution model (the same strategy was pursued with Más Música TeVe a few years later to launch MTV Tres). The concept behind The Box was later revived in 2010, when cable music service Music Choice launched SWRV (now Music Choice Play).\n\nThe Box's UK Operations (now owned by Channel 4) remain on the air to this day.\n\nHeadends incorporated a video server which allowed for localized content mixes – local demographics could be taken into account for selecting the list of videos available for request or frequently requested genres/bands could be queued automatically. The video server had up to a 64GB HDD and the video programs were compressed in the MPEG2 format. In 2000, The Box had approximately 1,800 music videos in its inventory, 150 to 300 of which were queued across the network, at any given time. Subscribers could call the Interactive Voice Response at The Box's central office to request videos over the phone, which was typical, but could also request over the internet or via set-top box. The central office would then send the data to the individual headends regarding what was ordered.\n\n"}

It is the site of the primary motor cortex that in humans is cytoarchitecturally defined as Brodmann area 4.\n\nThe precentral gyrus lies in front of the postcentral gyrus - mostly on the lateral (convex) side of each cerebral hemisphere - from which it is separated by the central sulcus.\nIts anterior border is represented by the precentral sulcus, while inferiorly it borders to the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). Medially, it is contiguous with the paracentral lobule.\n\nThe internal pyramidal layer (layer V) of the precentral cortex contains giant (70-100 micrometers) pyramidal neurons called Betz cells, which send long axons to the contralateral motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and to the lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These axons form the corticospinal tract. The Betz cells along with their long axons are referred to as upper motor neurons (UMN).\n\nThere is a precise somatotopic representation of the different body parts in the primary motor cortex, with the leg area located medially (close to the midline), and the head and face area located laterally on the convex side of the cerebral hemisphere (\"cortical homunculus\"). The arm and hand motor area is the largest and occupies the part of precentral gyrus, located inbetween the leg and face area.\n\nAs they travel down through the cerebral white matter, the motor axons move closer together and form part of the \"posterior limb\" of the internal capsule. They continue down into the brainstem, where some of them, after crossing over to the contralateral side, distribute to the cranial nerve motor nuclei. (Note: a few motor fibers synapse with lower motor neurons on the same side of the brainstem). After crossing over to the contralateral side in the medulla oblongata (pyramidal decussation), the axons travel down the spinal cord as the \"lateral corticospinal tract\". Fibers that do not cross over in the brainstem travel down the separate ventral corticospinal tract and most of them cross over to the contralateral side in the spinal cord, shortly before reaching the lower motor neurons.\n\nBranches of the middle cerebral artery provide most of the arterial blood supply for the primary motor cortex. The medial aspect (leg areas) is supplied by branches of the anterior cerebral artery.\n\nLesions of the precentral gyrus result in paralysis of the contralateral side of the body (facial palsy, arm-/leg monoparesis, hemiparesis) - see upper motor neuron.\n\n"}

She wants to see his concert, but it is all sold out. When she sneaks into his rehearsal he is smitten by her devotion and gets his orchestra to get it right as they play just for her. Constance marries Franz: he says she is \"a most exciting creature\" and she has been in love with him for a long time (i.e., \"since late this afternoon\").\n\nNot long after they get married Constance finds Franz having dinner with a female friend. So Constance responds by going out with her own friend, Johnny Lawrence (John Beal). Johnny wants to marry Constance, but she cannot forget her husband. Franz has been hitting the bottle and pretty much throwing away his career, although exactly which of his many sins is driving him to drink is not really clear. Fortunately, Constance has been working on her concerto.\n\n\nWriting for \"The Spectator\", Graham Greene praised the acting of Boyer and Hepburn which he described as \"talented enough to keep some of our interest even in a story of this kind\".

It is based on an earlier song called \"Let Me Go, Devil\", about alcoholism. \n\n\"Let Me Go, Lover\" was featured on the television program \"Studio One\" on November 15, 1954, and caught the fancy of the public. The episode was a murder mystery that revolved around a hit record and a disc jockey. Producer Felix Jackson asked Columbia Records' Mitch Miller for a recording to use in the show, and Miller provided Joan Weber's version of \"Let Me Go, Lover\". Miller took advantage of the recording's exposure on national television and sent copies of the record to 2,000 disc jockeys, who began to play it on their radio stations.\n\nWeber was pregnant when she recorded the song. A result of the program was to illustrate how efficiently a song could be promoted by introducing it to the public via radio or a TV production. The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 40366. Mitch Miller stocked national record stores the week before the program and because of its availability the record sold over 100,000 the first week of its release. It first reached the \"Billboard\" magazine charts on December 4, 1954. By January 1955, Weber's record of the song had hit No. 1 on all the \"Billboard\" charts (the Disk Jockey chart, the Best Seller chart, and the Juke Box chart). The song reached No. 16 in the UK Singles Chart, and was awarded a gold record.\n\nIt was also quickly covered by a number of other singers. One artist to cover it was Lucille Ball, in the March 18, 1955 episode of \"I Love Lucy\", entitled \"Bull Fight Dance\".\n\nAmong the cover versions was one by Patti Page. This recording was released by Mercury Records as catalog number 70511. It first reached the \"Billboard\" charts on December 18, 1954. On the Disk Jockey chart, it peaked at No. 8; on the Best Seller chart, at No. 24; on the Juke Box chart, at No. 12.\n\nAnother cover, by Teresa Brewer and The Lancers, was recorded on November 18, 1954, and released by Coral Records as catalog number 61315.

The vowel , which historically was back, is often central as well. This article discusses the history of these vowels in various dialects of English, focusing in particular on phonemic splits and mergers involving these sounds.\n\nIn the Old English vowel system, there was a pair of short and long close back vowels, and , both written (the longer vowel is often distinguished as in modern editions of Old English texts). There was also a pair of back vowels of mid-height, and , written (the longer one often in modern editions).\n\nThe same four vowels existed in the Middle English system. The short vowels were still spelt and , but long came to be spelt as , and as . Generally the Middle English vowels descended from the corresponding Old English ones, although there were certain alternative developments – see Phonological history of Old English#Changes leading up to Middle and Modern English.\n\nDue to Middle English open syllable lengthening, short was mostly lengthened to (an opener back vowel) in open syllables; this development can be seen in words like \"nose\". In the Great Vowel Shift, ME long ended up being raised to , in words like \"moon\"; ME long was diphthongized, becoming the present-day , as in \"mouse\"; and the of \"nose\" was raised and later diphthongized, leading to present-day .\n\nAt some point, short developed into a lax, near-close near-back rounded vowel, , as found in words like \"put\". (Similarly, short has become.) According to Roger Lass, this laxing occurred in the 17th century, but other linguists have suggested that it may have taken place much earlier. The short remaining in words like \"lot\" has also been lowered, and unrounded in some accents (see open back vowels).\n\nIn a handful of words, including some very common ones, the vowel was shortened to . In a few of these words, notably \"blood\" and \"flood\", this shortening happened early enough that the resulting underwent the \"\"foot–strut\" split\" (see next section) and are now pronounced with . Other words that underwent shortening later consistently have , such as \"good\", \"book\", and \"wool\". Still other words, such as \"roof\", \"hoof\", and \"root\" are in the process of the shift today, with some speakers preferring and others preferring in such words; for example in Texas. For some speakers in Northern England, words ending in \"-ook\" such as \"book\", \"cook\" still have the long vowel.\n\nThe \"foot–strut\" split is the split of Middle English short into two distinct phonemes (as in \"foot\") and (as in \"strut\"). The split occurs in most varieties of English, the most notable exceptions being the majority of Northern England and the English Midlands, and some varieties of Hiberno-English. In Welsh English, the split is also absent in parts of North Wales, under influence from Merseyside and Cheshire accents, and south Pembrokeshire, an area where English replaced Welsh long before this occurred in the rest of Wales.\n\nThe origin of the split is the unrounding of in Early Modern English, resulting in the phoneme . In general (though with some exceptions), unrounding to did not occur if was preceded by a labial consonant (e.g., , , ) and followed by , , or , leaving the modern . Because of the inconsistency of the split, the words \"put\" and \"putt\" became a minimal pair, distinguished as and . The first clear description of the split dates from 1644.\n\nIn non-splitting accents, \"cut\" and \"put\" rhyme, \"putt\" and \"put\" are homophonous as , and \"pudding\" and \"budding\" rhyme. However \"luck\" and \"look\" are not necessarily homophones; many accents in the area concerned have \"look\" as , with the vowel of \"goose\". In the Coventry area, Schwas are often hyper-corrected to , such as for 'button'.\n\nThe absence of this split is a less common feature of educated Northern English speech than the absence of the trap–bath split. The absence of the foot–strut split is sometimes stigmatized, and speakers of non-splitting accents may try to introduce it into their speech, sometimes resulting in hypercorrections such as pronouncing \"butcher\" .\n\nThe name \"foot–strut split\" refers to the lexical sets introduced by , and identifies the vowel phonemes in the words. From a historical point of view, this name is inappropriate because the word \"foot\" did not have short at the time the split happened, but underwent shortening at a later time.\n\nIn modern standard varieties of English, e.g. Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), the spelling is a reasonably good guide to whether a word is in the FOOT or STRUT lexical sets. The spellings o and u nearly always indicate the STRUT set (common exceptions are \"wolf, woman\", \"pull, bull, full\", \"push, bush\", \"cushion\", \"puss\", \"put\", \"pudding\" and \"butcher\"), while the spellings oo and ould usually indicate the FOOT set (common exceptions are \"blood\" and \"flood\"). The spellings of some words changed in accordance with this pattern: e.g. wull became wool and wud became wood. In some recent loan words such as \"Muslim\" both pronunciations are found.\n\nThe strut–comma\" merger or the strut–schwa\" merger is a merger of with which occurs in Welsh English and some higher-prestige Northern England English. It is also usual in General American, and it causes minimal pairs such as \"unorthodoxy\" and \"an orthodoxy\" to be merged. The phonetic quality of the merged vowel depends on the accent. For instance, in merging General American accents is the stressed variant, the word-final one is and elsewhere the vowel surfaces as or even (GA features the weak vowel merger). This can cause words such as \"hubbub\" ( in RP) to have two different vowels (), even though both syllables contain the same phoneme in both merging and non-merging accents. On the other hand, in Birmingham, Miami and Swansea at least the non-final variant of the merged vowel is consistently realized as mid central , with no noticeable difference between the stressed and unstressed allophones.\n\nThe merged vowel is typically written with , regardless of its phonetic realization. To a large extent, this matches an older canonical phonetic range of the IPA symbol , which used to be described as covering a vast central area from near-close to near-open .\n\nBecause of the unstressed nature of the merger occurs only in unstressed syllables. Word-finally, the two vowels do not contrast in any accent of English (ME , the vowel from which was split could not occur in that position) and the vowel which occurs in that position approaches (the main allophone of in many accents), though there is some dialectal variation, with varieties such as broad Cockney using strikingly more open variants than other dialects. It is usually identified as belonging to the phoneme, even in accents without the merger, but native speakers may perceive the phonemic makeup of words such as \"comma\" to be rather than . This open variety of occurs even in Northern English dialects (such as Geordie) which have not undergone the foot–strut split, though in Geordie it can be generalized to other positions so that not only \"comma\" but also \"commas\" can be pronounced with in the second syllable, which is rare in other accents. In contemporary General British the final is often mid , rather than open .\n\nAll speakers of General American neutralize , and (the vowel) before , which results in an r-colored vowel . GA lacks a truly contrastive phoneme (\"furry\", \"hurry\", \"letters\" and \"transfer\" (n.), distinguished in RP as , , and all have the same r-colored in GA) and the symbol is used only to facilitate comparisons with other accents. See hurry–furry merger for more information.\n\nSome other minimal pairs apart from \"unorthodoxy\"–\"an orthodoxy\" include \"unequal\" vs. \"an equal\" as well as \"a large untidy room\" vs. \"a large and tidy room\" . However, there are few minimal pairs like this and using them as such has been criticized by scholars such as Geoff Lindsey because the members of such minimal pairs are structurally different. There also are words which in RP always have in the unstressed syllable, such as \"pick-up\" or \"sawbuck\" which in merging accents have the same as the second vowel of \"balance\". In RP, there is a consistent difference in vowel height; the unstressed vowel in the first two words is a near-open (traditionally written with ), whereas in \"balance\" it is a mid .\n\nEarlier Middle English distinguished the close front rounded vowel (occurring in loanwords from Anglo-Norman like \"duke\") and the diphthongs (occurring in words like \"new\"), (occurring in words like \"few\") and (occurring in words like \"dew\").\n\nBy the time of Late Middle English, , , and had merged as . In Early Modern English, merged into as well.\n\nThis has remained as such in some Welsh, some northern English, and a rare few American accents, so that, in a variety of Welsh English, \"threw\" is distinct from \"through\" . In the majority of accents, however, the falling diphthong turned into a rising diphthong, which became the sequence . This change had taken place in London by the end of the 17th century. Depending on the preceding consonant and on the dialect, this either remained as or developed into by the processes of yod-dropping or yod-coalescence. Hence the present-day standard English pronunciations of \"duke\" (or ), \"new\" , \"few\" and \"rude\" .\n\nThe \"foot–goose\" merger is a phenomenon that occurs in Scottish English, Ulster varieties of Hiberno-English, Malaysian English and Singapore English, where the vowels and are merged. As a result, pairs like \"look\"/\"Luke\" are homophones and \"good\"/\"food\" and \"foot\"/\"boot\" rhyme. The quality of the merged vowel is usually or in Scottish English and in Singapore English. The use of the same vowel in \"foot\" and \"goose\" in these dialects is not due to phonemic merger, but the appliance of different languages' vowel system to the English lexical incidence. The full–fool merger is a conditioned merger of the same two vowels before , making pairs like \"pull\"/\"pool\" and \"full\"/\"fool\" homophones.\n\nIn Geordie, the vowel undergoes an allophonic split, with the monophthong being used in morphologically closed syllables (as in \"bruise\" ) and the diphthong being used in morphologically open syllables, not only at the very end of a word (as in \"brew\" ), but also word-internally at the end of a morpheme (as in \"brews\" ).\n\nMany other dialects of English diphthongize , but in most of them the diphthongal realization is in a more or less free variation with the monophthong .\n\nCompare the identical development of the close front vowel.\n\nThe change of to is a process that occurs in many varieties of British English where bisyllabic becomes the diphthong in certain words. As a result, \"ruin\" is pronounced as monosyllabic and \"fluid\" is pronounced .\n\n\n"}

Both teams always play their best when pitted against each other and to the countless PBA fans, the Crispa-Toyota rivalry will always be the pro league's supreme ruler.\n\nThey faced each other in the finals for six consecutive conferences in the PBA's first two seasons in 1975-1976. Toyota gained the headstart, winning their first two championships in the league's maiden season. After Crispa denied Toyota of a grandslam in 1975, by winning the third conference All-Philippine championship in a pulsating 3-2 series victory, the Redmanizers defeated the Comets in all three conferences the following year in 1976, thus becoming the league's first grandslam winner. \n\nAfter the 1976 season, the two rivals would not face each other again during the finals until the 1979 season, Crispa would beat Toyota for the fifth straight time in the finals series during the 1979 All-Filipino. The Tamaraws finally snap a string of finals losses to the Redmanizers by winning the third conference Invitational championship. \n\nThe final championship face-off between the two teams was during the 1981 Open Conference. The Toyota Super Diesels defeated the Crispa Redmanizers, 103-97, in the fifth and final game of the best-of-five title series on July 25, 1981. The count in the finals meeting was six wins for Crispa and four for Toyota.\n\nTheir final official PBA game took place on October 9, 1983 with Crispa winning, 111-96. \n\nIn terms of cumulative PBA games played between each other (1975-1983), Crispa won 65 games as against 58 to Toyota.\n\nThe companies behind both teams were affected by the economic downturn of the Philippines, following the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1983. This resulted in the disbandment of the Toyota team in February 1984 and Crispa the following year.\n\n\nThe rivalry of both teams is still remembered to this day by older basketball fans, sharing countless stories of the historic rivalry. Since the disbandment of both teams, there were a few short-lived rivalries in the PBA that followed, but not as intense and anticipated as to this rivalry.\n\nPlayers from both teams garnered instant popularity outside of the playing court. Such was evident with Robert Jaworski's senatorial victory in 1998, Ramon Fernandez's and Philip Cezar's activities within the sport, and the several movie and television show appearances of Atoy Co, Bernie Fabiosa among others.\n\nA highly anticipated reunion game between both teams was played on May 30, 2003 at the Araneta Coliseum as part of the league's All-Star Weekend festivities.\n\nAlthough most of the players were already past their prime, it did not look like they lost a step at all as each possession was tenaciously fought. The game was a hotly contested match which saw the lead change hands many times, a virtual flashback to both teams' glory days in the late seventies and early eighties.\n\nToyota won the reunion game 65-61 but not without some late-game magic from Jaworski. After Bogs Adornado's three-pointer with under a minute left to cut the deficit at 62-61, Toyota teammate and former rival Fernandez passed to ball to Jaworski on the outside. The then-Senator hit the three-pointer to put the game away for good, to the delight of a huge crowd at the Big Dome. Many believed that the play was reversal of the memorable game-winner of Fernandez, from a Jaworski pass, that won the game for the veterans in the first-ever All-Star Game in 1989, in which both players shook-hands to end their well-documented feud.\n\nThe winning Toyota team was coached by Dante Silverio, with Jaworski also lending some of his coaching tactics, while Crispa was coached by the legendary Baby Dalupan.\n\nTerry Saldaña won the MVP of the game after posting a double-double for the Tamaraws. Although the losing Redmanizers called for a rematch, there has been no serious talk of a potential rematch by both teams.\n\nOn 28 May 2005, to celebrate the PBA's 30th Anniversary, the League held \"PBA's Greatest Game\", a match featuring many star players from the League's long history. The game featured the Greats Team coached by Robert Jaworski, and a few Toyota players. On the other side, coach Baby Dalupan had his Legends Team, which featured Crispa players. The game was won by the Legends Team, 96-92, but the stars of that match were the greats of the younger generation.\n\nIn retrospect, the Crispa–Toyota rivalry was one of the most colorful episodes in Philippine sports, and ensured the popularity of the Philippine Basketball Association and of basketball in the country.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1983:\n\nFrom 1975 to 1983:\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1954771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954771", "title": "Swaddling", "text": "Swaddling\n\nSwaddling is an age-old practice of wrapping infants in blankets or similar cloths so that movement of the limbs is tightly restricted. Swaddling bands were often used to further restrict the infant. Swaddling fell out of favor in the 17th century.\n\nSome authors are of the opinion that swaddling is becoming popular again, although medical and psychological opinion on the effects of swaddling is divided. Some modern medical studies indicate that swaddling helps babies fall asleep and to remain asleep and helps to keep the baby in a supine position, which lowers the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, one recent study indicated that swaddling increased the risk of SIDS.Additionally emerging evidence is showing that certain swaddling techniques may increase the risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip.\n\nSeveral authors presume that swaddling was invented in the paleolithic period.\nThe earliest depictions of swaddled babies are votive offerings and grave goods from Crete and Cyprus, 4000 to 4500 years old.\n\nVotive statuettes have been found in the tombs of Ancient Greek and Roman women who died in childbirth, displaying babies in swaddling clothes. In shrines dedicated to Amphiaraus, models representing babies wrapped in swaddling clothes have been excavated. Apparently, these were frequently given as thank-offerings by anxious mothers when their infants had recovered from sickness.\n\nProbably the most famous record of swaddling is found in the New Testament concerning the birth of Jesus in :\nSwaddling clothes described in the Bible consisted of a cloth tied together by bandage-like strips. After an infant was born, the umbilical cord was cut and tied, and then the baby was washed, rubbed with salt and oil, and wrapped with strips of cloth. These strips kept the newborn child warm and also ensured that the child's limbs would grow straight. describes Israel as unswaddled, a metaphor for abandonment.\n\nDuring Tudor times, swaddling involved wrapping the new baby in linen bands from head to foot to ensure the baby would grow up without physical deformity. A stay band would be attached to the forehead and the shoulders to secure the head. Babies would be swaddled like this until about 8 or 9 months.\n\nThe Swiss surgeon Felix Würtz (approx. 1500 to approx. 1598) was the first who criticized aspects of swaddling openly.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the scientific opinion towards swaddling began to change. There was an association of neglect with swaddling, especially regarding wetnurses who would leave babies in their care swaddled for long periods without washing or comforting them. More than a hundred years after Würtz, physicians and philosophers from England began to openly criticize swaddling and finally demanded its complete abolishment. The British philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) rejected swaddling in his 1693 publication \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\", becoming a lobbyist for not binding babies at all. This thought was very controversial during the time, but slowly gained ground, first in England and later elsewhere in Western Europe.\n\nWilliam Cadogan (1711–1797) seems to have been the first physician, who pleaded for the complete abolition of swaddling. In his \"Essay upon Nursing\" of 1748, he expressed his view of contemporary child care, swaddling, the topic of too much clothing for infants and overfeeding. He wrote:\n\nPhilosophers and physicians more and more began to reject swaddling in the 18th century. Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote in his book \"\" in 1762:\n\nAlthough this form of swaddling has fallen out of favour in the Western world, many Eastern cultures and tribal people still use it.\n\nThe swaddling clothes of mediaeval Madonna and Child paintings are now replaced with cotton receiving blankets, cotton muslin wraps, or specialised \"winged\" baby swaddles. Modern swaddling is becoming increasingly popular today as a means of settling and soothing irritable infants and helping babies sleep longer with fewer awakenings. Since the early 1990s, the medical community has recommended placing babies on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. As studies proved swaddled babies sleep better in the back sleeping position, swaddling has become increasingly popular and recommended so parents avoid the dangerous stomach sleeping position. \nSwaddling also prevents newborns waking themselves with their Moro reflex.\n\nLoose and ineffective swaddling techniques made while using an undersized blanket can generally be kicked off by a wakeful baby. It is important for caregivers to accomplish a secure swaddle to ensure the blanket does not become loose and the baby remains wrapped during the sleep period. The act of swaddling does carry a risk of the baby overheating if the caregiver uses multiple blankets that are too thick or uses thick fluffy fabric that creates excessive thermal insulation.\n\nModern specialized baby swaddles are designed to make it easier to swaddle a baby than with traditional square blanket. They are typically fabric blankets in a triangle, 'T' or 'Y' shape, with 'wings' that fold around the baby's torso or down over the baby's shoulders and around underneath the infant. Some of these products employ Velcro patches or other fasteners. Some parents prefer a specialized device because of the relative ease of use, and many parents prefer a large square receiving blanket or wrap because they can get a tighter and custom fit and the baby will not outgrow the blanket.\n\nTo avoid hip dysplasia risk, the swaddle should be done in such a way that the baby is able to move his or her legs freely at the hip. This is more easily done with a large blanket that can keep the arms in place while allowing the legs flexibility, all while allowing for proper hip development.\n\nBy the time the baby is learning to roll over, often around 4–5 months, parents and caregivers should transition the baby from swaddling to a less restrictive covering for sleep. If the baby can roll over, then it is important for the baby to have use of its hands and arms to adjust his or her head position after rolling over.\nThe traditional swaddling uses flat strings for babies to be tied; care is needed not to tie them too hard or blood flow would be restricted.\n\nSwaddling is still practiced worldwide. In some countries, swaddling is the standard treatment of babies. In Turkey, for instance, 93.1% of all babies become swaddled in the traditional way. According to the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), 39% of all documented contemporary non-industrialized cultures show swaddling practices; further 19% use other methods of movement restriction for infants. Some authors assume that the popularity of swaddling is growing in the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands. A British sample showed up 19.4% of the babies are swaddled at night. In Germany, swaddling is not used as routine care measure and experiences relatively little acceptance, as the missing mentioning of this practice in the standard work on regulatory disturbances of Papusek shows.\n\nSwaddling as a medical intervention with a clearly limited indication range is used in the care practices of premature babies or crybabies with brain-organically provable damage. Also swaddling is used for reducing pain in such care actions as collecting blood at the heel. The swaddling of these premature babies (very low birth weight infants) takes place only very loosely. It is meant to hold the weak arms at the body and make certain movements possible. This \"swaddling\" is something completely different from traditional swaddling in the stretched position.\n\nModern medical studies of swaddling use a form that is considerably shorter and less severe than the historical forms. The classical study by Lipton \"et al.\" of 1965 dealt with a modern swaddling form. The researchers described the two main effects of tightly wrapping babies: they are motorically calm and sleep much. These effects are detected by means of various psycho-physiological parameters, such as heart rate, sleep duration and duration of crying. The research group around the Dutch biologist van Sleuwen in 2007 confirms this picture in their latest meta-analysis of medical studies on swaddling and its effects.\n\nHowever, severe restrictions on the scope of these studies should be kept in mind, because most of the positive effects mentioned by van Sleuwen \"et al.\" are not related to normally developed newborns, but to impaired babies, namely premature babies and babies with detectable organic brain damage.\nSwaddling enhances the REM sleep (active sleep) and also the whole sleep duration.\nThe effect of swaddling on the regulatory disturbance excessive crying is not very convincing: By adding the swaddling there is an immediate \"calming\" effect on children, but after a few days the effect of the introduction of regularity with swaddling is exactly the same as the regularity on its own. In other words: after a few days swaddling is completely unnecessary. It is therefore contraindicated to address the potential risk of swaddling, because the effect is only for a short term available, but after a little while is negligible.\n\nTwo studies based on indigenous peoples of the Americas did not show a delay in the onset of walking caused by the restraint of the use of the cradleboard. In other areas of the motor development, clear delays of the development show up even when mild restrictions take place. A Japanese study concluded that the application of the basket cradle (\"ejiko\") leads to a delayed onset of walking. An older Austrian study showed that swaddled Albanian babies showed a delayed ability to crawl and reach things with their hands. This shows the need for further substantial scientific clarifying regarding the impairment of motor skills by swaddling.\n\nThe effects of swaddling on the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are unclear. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.\n\nSwaddling was supposed to keep babies on their back, in order to prevent SIDS. Swaddling itself is not seen as a protective factor for SIDS. Swaddling may even increase the risk when babies sleep in the prone position; it reduces the risk if they sleep in the supine position. A recent study demonstrated now, that swaddling is apparently a risk factor for SIDS, although the opposite was often previously assumed: Of the babies who died of SIDS, 24% were swaddled; in the control-groups only 6% were swaddled.\n\nSeveral empirical studies show evidence of negative effects of swaddling. \n\n\n"}

It is one of several reliever airports in the Twin Cities operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. The airport has three runways and serves aircraft operated by corporations in the local area, a flight training school and the Minnesota Army National Guard aviation unit, as well as transient general aviation aircraft.\n\nThe airport is home to an installation of the Minnesota Army National Guard. Two properties at the airport are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1939 Holman Field Administration Building and the 1942 Riverside Hangar.\n\nHolman Field was named for Charles W. \"Speed\" Holman (1898–1931), who was a stunt pilot, barnstormer, wing walker, parachutist, airmail pilot, aviation record holder and airline pilot. Born in Bloomington, he was the first pilot hired by Northwest Airways in 1926. In 1928, Holman set a world's record of 1,433 consecutive loops in an airplane in five hours over the St. Paul Airport. He died in an accident during an air show in Omaha in 1931 at the age of 32.\n\nDuring World War II, Northwest Airlines employed up to 5,000 people at the site, modifying new B-24 Liberator bombers, some of which received the highly classified H2X radar, which proved to be an invaluable tool in the European theater.\n\nThe terminal was used as a backdrop for scenes in the 1972 film \"Slaughterhouse-Five\".\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, commuter airline Lake State Airways offered scheduled airline service between the St. Paul Downtown Airport and Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota. It cost $5USD for a one-way ticket between the two airports, and $10 round-trip. Capitol Air flew MDW-STP with a Swearingen Metroliner for roughly a year starting December 1993.\n\nSt. Paul Downtown Holman Field covers an area of which contains three asphalt paved runways: 14/32 measuring 6,491 x 150 ft (1,978 x 46 m), 13/31 measuring 4,004 x 150 ft (1,220 x 46 m) and 9/27 measuring 3,642 x 100 ft (1,110 x 30 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014, the airport had 66,475 aircraft operations, an average of 182 per day: 74% general aviation, 15% military and 11% air taxi. In January 2017, there were 68 aircraft based at this airport: 20 single-engine, 12 multi-engine, 18 jet, 7 helicopter and 11 military.\n\nRecently local debate has ensued over plans to build a flood wall around the airport. In 1993, 1997, and 2001, the airport was flooded due to its proximity to the Mississippi River. Supporters do not want to deal with the future inconvenience of having to deal with the flood again, while critics say that the proposed wall would ruin views and make the airport \"ugly\". A dike to protect the airport from the nearby river was considered since the National Guard stated that they may leave if the dike is not constructed in a timely manner.\n\nIn 2009, a removable flood wall was installed that is only erected when flooding is imminent, leaving the views of the river intact for the rest of the year. Steel plates are embedded in the concrete on the river side of the runways. The flood wall is composed of steel posts that anchor to the embedded plates and aluminum planks that are stacked between the posts to form a flood barrier. These are then removed and stored when the flood event has passed.\n\n\n"}

Jim Ross cites him as the most significant influence on his career as an announcer.\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Solie moved to Tampa, Florida, in the 1950s after completing military service in the United States Air Force. Solie began his pro wrestling career as a ring announcer, making $5 a night emceeing weekly shows in the Tampa Bay area. He soon began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida, and in 1960, he moved into the broadcast booth to become the lead announcer for CWF's Saturday morning television shows, a spot he would occupy for the next quarter-century. During that time, he commentated on matches featuring some of pro wrestling's biggest legends, including WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes, The Brisco Brothers and Dory Funk Jr., among numerous others. Solie rose to national prominence when Superstation WTBS began broadcasting pro wrestling, and the exposure helped him branch out, leading to Solie working for promotions in Georgia, Alabama and Puerto Rico.\n\nMuch of his fame stems from the gravelly sound of his voice calling the in-ring action and his unique lingo. He sometimes is incorrectly credited for originating the term \"Pier-Six Brawl\" to describe a wild brawl, and was also notorious for noting when a bloodied superstar was \"wearing a crimson mask.\" His oft-imitated signature call of a suplex as a \"su-play.\" His signature sign-off was: \"So long from the Sunshine State,\" followed by a wink.\n\nIn 1987, a board game, Gordon Solie's Championship Wrestling Trivia Game, was released by Sports Entertainment International, Inc.\n\nWhen CWF finally folded in 1987, Solie returned to Georgia and became one of the lead announcers for the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance) later WCW television programs. Solie also worked for the Continental Wrestling Federation and USA Championship Wrestling based out of Knoxville. It was a natural transition for \"The Dean,\" who had also been Georgia Championship Wrestling's lead announcer before it became a subsidiary of NWA/WCW. He remained there until his eventual retirement in 1995; his last event was 1995 Slamboree. He was diagnosed with cancer soon after his retirement. In the late-1990s, his vocal chords were removed due to throat cancer. In July 2000, he died due to throat cancer at the age of 71.\n\nIn 2005, Solie's posthumously released memoir \"Gordon Solie ... Something Left Behind\" became a best-seller. On March 29, 2008, Jim Ross posthumously inducted Solie into the WWE Hall of Fame in the Class of 2008; appearing on Solie's behalf were his five children, Pam, Danise, Jonard, Eric and Greg. Later the same year WWE's WWE Classics on Demand video service began offering \"The Film Room with Gordon Solie\", hosted by Ross, focusing on Solie's announcing and interviewing of a specific wrestler or group of wrestlers involved in a feud. On August 11, 2009 Solie's biography, \" The Solie Chronicles\" was released by Crowbar Press.\n\nSolie's last announcing job was to be the Heroes of Wrestling pay-per-view in 1999, but he could not attend due to failing health.

{"id": "1954794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954794", "title": "The Rise of the West", "text": "The Rise of the West\n\nThe Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community is a book by University of Chicago historian William H. McNeill, first published in 1963 and enlarged with a retrospective preface in 1991. It explores world history in terms of the effect different old world civilizations had on one another, and especially the deep influence of Western civilization on the rest of the world in the past 500 years. He argues that societal contact with foreign civilizations is the primary force in driving historical change. In 1964 it won the National Book Award in History and Biography.\n\nPart I of \"The Rise of the West\" discusses evolutionary prehistory, the breakthrough to civilization in Mesopotamia, the era of Middle Eastern dominance, and the formation of peripheral civilizations in India, Greece, and China to 500 B.C.\n\nPart II discusses the Eurasian cultural balance to 1500 AD, including the expansion of Hellenism, the closure of the Eurasian ecumene, the development of major religions, the barbarian onslaught, resurgence of the Middle East, and steppe conquerors. McNeill proposes that the basic engine of world history during this period is the temporary primacy of different regions of the ecumene, with a rough parity reestablished as innovations spread to other centers of civilization. The sequence is Hellenistic / Indian / Islamic / Chinese and Mongol. Generally the eras are structured in terms of the internal history of the dominant region, followed by the history of the rest of the world with a focus on how they reacted to the diffusing techniques and ideas of the dominant region.\n\nPart III examines the era of Western dominance. From 1500 to 1750 this is represented by the challenge of Western Europe to the world in a period of exploitation and colonization and the changing balance of the ecumene in the Islamic world, the Far East, and Africa. Before 1750, Western superiority is similar in scope to the primacy previously enjoyed by other regions. The book describes the \"tottering balance\" of older orders within Europe, European expansion and acculturation in outliers, including the Americas. The rise of the West on a cosmopolitan scale from 1750 to 1950 is described as to continued territorial expansion, industrialism, the democratic revolution, and intellectual aspects. This period marks a discontinuity: the global influence of the West expands beyond all historical parallels.\n\nHugh Trevor-Roper wrote a glowing review in \"The New York Times Book Review\". McNeill's \"Rise of the West\" won the U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography in 1964. and was named one of the 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the 20th century by the Modern Library. One critical response has been that the West did not rise, the East fell or withdrew.\n\nThe \"Rise\" had two major effects on historical analysis. First, it challenged the view of civilizations as independent entities subject to rise and fall as postulated by Arnold J. Toynbee and Oswald Spengler, who viewed civilizations as discrete and independent. McNeill had actually conceived of the book as a student in 1936 to counter the theses of Spengler's \"Decline of the West\" (the title \"The Rise of the West\" chosen as a deliberate contrast) and Toynbee's \"A Study of History\", which \"postulated that civilizations marched to their own drummers, largely unaffected by foreign influences\". McNeill, on the other hand, stresses the diffusion of techniques and ideas, making connections between civilizations crucially important. Second, it provided a framework for theories like world-systems theory and dependency theory, which \"cemented the centrality of the 'West' in world history\".\n\nIt's important to note, however, that in a 1990 article in the \"Journal of World History\", McNeill reflected that \"The Rise of the West\" must be viewed as \"an expression of the imperial mood in the United States\" and admitted that it could somewhat be seen as a \"form of intellectual imperialism\". Later, in a 1991 essay, McNeill emphasized that the unifying theme of his book was the importance of interrelation and cultural diffusion rather than a flat description of western history's effect on other civilizations.\n\n\n\n"}

He played shooting guard and small forward for the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers and Charlotte Hornets.\n\nA native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Phills attended Baton Rouge's Southern University. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. He was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1991 NBA draft (45th overall).\n\nAfter being cut in December 1991 without playing a game for the Bucks, Phills had a stint with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the Continental Basketball Association before being signed by the Cavaliers and rejoining the NBA late in the 1991–92 season. Over his nine-year career, he averaged 11.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game. He was known as a defensive stopper, averaging 1.3 steals per game for his career, and an excellent perimeter shooter, with a 39.0% career three-point shooting percentage.\n\nPhills attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He led the NCAA in three-point field goals per game (4.39) his senior year.\n\nThough he made a name for himself as a shooter during his college career, Phills became known as a tenacious wing defender in the NBA. At 6' 5\" and 220 pounds, he was said to more resemble an NFL linebacker than a basketball player. In 1996, Michael Jordan remarked that Phills was the toughest defender he had ever faced.\n\nOn January 12, 2000, while a member of the Charlotte Hornets, Phills was killed in a car accident in Charlotte, North Carolina. Phills was traveling behind teammate David Wesley at over when his Porsche spun and crossed into oncoming traffic. It hit another car, which in turn was struck in the rear by a minivan. The drivers of the other two vehicles recovered, while Phills was pronounced dead at the scene. A police report said Phills and Wesley were driving \"in an erratic, reckless, careless, negligent or aggressive manner.\" Wesley was later convicted of reckless driving after being cleared of a racing charge.\n\nPhills was survived by his parents, his wife Kendall, and two children; a son Bobby Ray Phills III, known as Trey and a daughter Kerstie. Trey gained statewide recognition in North Carolina while playing for Charlotte Christian School. He played college basketball for the Yale Bulldogs and now plays for the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League. After starting her college career at Wagner, Kerstie transferred and is currently a redshirt sophomore for Florida Gulf Coast University.\n\nThe Hornets retired his #13 jersey number on February 9, 2000, in a game vs. Phills' former team, the Cavaliers. Phills was the first number that the Hornets franchise had ever retired. It continued to hang for the original Hornets franchise until the end of the first season when the team moved to New Orleans. In 2004, the NBA added an expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats. After the New Orleans team re-branded themselves as the New Orleans Pelicans, thereby relinquishing the Hornets name and their previous history in Charlotte, the Bobcats became the Hornets and merged the team's past tenures into a new history for the franchise. On November 1, 2014, the newly renamed team rehung his jersey from the rafters of Spectrum Center.\n\n\n"}

In 1932, James Banning, accompanied by Thomas C. Allen, became America's first black aviator to fly coast-to-coast.\n\nDreaming from boyhood of being a pilot, Banning eventually learned to fly from an army aviator after being repeatedly turned away from flight schools due to racial discrimination. He later became a demonstration pilot on the west coast, flying a biplane named \"Miss Ames\" (he had attended Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa).\n\nJames Banning and his mechanic Thomas Allen made the historic flight using a plane supplemented with surplus parts. The \"Flying Hoboes,\" as they were affectionately known, made the 3,300 mile trip from Los Angeles to Long Island, NY in 41 hours and 27 minutes aloft. However, the trip actually required 21 days to complete because the pilots had to raise money for the next leg of the trip each time they stopped.\n\nOnly four months after his historic flight, Banning was killed in a plane crash during an air show at Camp Kearny military base in San Diego on February 5, 1933. He was a passenger in a two-seater Travelaire biplane flown by Navy machinist mate second class Albert Burghardt, who was at the controls because Banning had been refused use of the airplane by an instructor at the Airtech Flying School. After taking off and climbing four-hundred feet, the plane stalled and entered an unrecoverable tailspin in front of hundreds of horrified spectators.

He is the Henry Putnam University Professor of Sociology at Princeton University where he is also an affiliate of the Office of Population Research and the Center for Health and Wellbeing. He also holds appointments as an Adjunct Professor of Community Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, as a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and as Dean of Health Science (pro bono) for the University of the People and sits as a member on their Health Science Advisory Board. He formerly served as the Dean for the Social Sciences and Chair of the Department of Sociology at New York University, where he had been University Professor with appointments in Sociology, Public Policy and the School of Medicine. In 2005, Conley became the first sociologist to win the National Science Foundation's Alan T. Waterman Award. He is a 2011 Guggenheim Fellow and an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2018 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nA graduate of New York City's prestigious math and science Stuyvesant High School, he also graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Humanities, and from Columbia University with an M.P.A. in Public Policy, and a Ph.D. in Sociology. He also holds an M.S. and Ph.D in Biology (Genomics) from NYU.\n\nConley is best known for his contributions to understanding how health and socioeconomic status are transmitted across generations. To this end, his research has examined the role of family wealth (as distinct from income) in status attainment, investigated the role of prenatal environment and birth weight on educational outcomes, addressed the causes and consequences of sibling differences in class status; and explored gene-environment interactions in family and economic life.\n\nHis first book, \"Being Black, Living in the Red\" (1999), focuses on the role of family wealth in perpetuating class advantages and racial inequalities in the post-Civil Rights era.\n\nHe has studied the role of health in the status attainment process. A seminal article entitled, \"Is Biology Destiny: Birth Weight and Life Chances\" (with Neil G. Bennett, American Sociological Review 1999) and his second book, which emerged from this and related pieces, \"The Starting Gate: Birth Weight and Life Chances\" (with Kate Strully and Neil G. Bennett, 2003) showed the importance of birth weight and prenatal health to later socioeconomic outcomes, reversing the typical way sociologists viewed the health-economics relationship and anticipated a robust research literature on early life health conditions as they affect later socioeconomic processes and outcomes.\n\n\"The Pecking Order\", which followed in 2004, showed the importance of within-family, ascriptive factors in determining sibling differences in socioeconomic success, thereby challenging the usual association of intra-household differences with the greater salience of achievement and/or meritocracy.\n\n\"Elsewhere, U.S.A.: How We Got from the Company Man, Family Dinners and the Affluent Society to the Home Office, BlackBerry Moms and Economic Anxiety\" (2009) chronicles how American society has moved from embodying Max Weber's Protestant ethic in the 19th and early 20th Centuries to William H. Whyte's \"social ethic\" during the mid-20th Century to today's \"elsewhere ethic,\" in which the pressure from high and rising income inequality within the knowledge economy interacts with telecommunications technologies to shift the income elasticity of labor supply such that higher skilled professionals work ever longer hours, thereby altering family life and tearing down once-sacrosanct boundaries of the modern era such as those between work and leisure, public and private, and even self and other.\n\nIn 2014, he published the satirical book, \"Parentology: Everything You Wanted to Know About the Science of Raising Children but Were Too Exhausted to Ask\". This book uses his own quirky parenting decisions—such as naming his first child a letter of the alphabet, getting his kids as many pets as possible in their NYC apartment, and setting up a homework economy of bribery—as a trope to humorously discuss the science of child development.\n\nIn 2017, his newest book, \"The Genome Factor: What the Social Genomics Revolution Reveals About Ourselves, Our History and the Future\" (Princeton University Press), co-authored with Jason Fletcher, will be released. This volume argues that the nature-nurture debate is over. Now that many large scale social surveys collect genetic data, researchers who study behavior and social life can obtain a complete picture of how the forces of genetics and the environment interact to produce human outcomes. Conley and Fletcher address topics ranging from the role of genes in social mobility, genetic and social assortative mating, the difference between race and genetic ancestry and the potential rise of a genotocracy as foreshadowed by the 1997 film, Gattaca.\n\nHis best-selling Introduction to Sociology textbook is \"You May Ask Yourself,\" currently in its 6th edition.\n\nIn addition to these works, Conley is the author of the acclaimed sociological memoir \"Honky\" (2000), which examines Conley's own childhood growing up white in an inner-city neighborhood of housing projects of New York City. \"Honky\" explores the intersection of race and class in America, outlining the subtle but profoundly important privileges even an impoverished white boy enjoys over his darker-skinned peers.\n\nConley's work has also appeared in many mainstream media publications. He has written many op-ed pieces for \"The New York Times\" on topics ranging from the calculation of slavery reparations to roommate random assignment to the dividend tax and its relation to corporate personhood. He is frequently interviewed for articles on race, family, and socioeconomic status.\n\nConley is married to the Bosnian-American astrophysicist Tea Temim with whom he has a child. He also has two children from a previous marriage: a daughter named E and a son named Yo Xing Heyno Augustus Eisner Alexander Weiser Knuckles Jeremijenko-Conley.\n\n\n"}

This work has been called \"the most influential theatrical text of the 1960s\".\n\nBorn Pereszlényi Gyula Márton in Budapest, Esslin moved to Vienna with his family at a young age. He studied Philosophy and English at the University of Vienna and later studied directing under Max Reinhardt at the Reinhardt Seminar of Dramatic Arts in 1928; actor Milo Sperber was a classmate. Of Jewish descent (but not of Jewish practice), he fled Austria in the wake of the \"Anschluss\" of 1938, moving to Brussels for a year and then moving on to England.\n\nIn his book, \"Theatre of the Absurd\", written in 1962, he defined the \"Theatre of the Absurd\" as follows:\n\nThis attribute of \"absurdity\" was not accepted by many of the playwrights associated with this trend. Playwright Eugène Ionesco stated that he did not like labels. Ahmad Kamyabi Mask criticized Esslin for a purported \"colonialist\" quality of this title for the Avant-garde theater. However, his work inspired other playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Arrthur Adamov, Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter (as well as Ionesco).\n\nHe began working for the BBC in 1940, serving as a producer, script writer and broadcaster. He headed BBC Radio Drama from 1963–77, having previously worked for the external European Service. He was later given the position of Head of Radio Drama, in which he tried to bring to life his dream of \"national theatre of the air\". He and his BBC team also translated many foreign works into English during this time. After leaving the BBC he held senior academic posts at Florida State University from 1969 to 1976 and Stanford University from 1977 to 1988. In 1977, Esslin joined the Magic Theatre as the first resident dramaturg in American theatre, a position now integral to American new playhouses.\n\nSome of the works he adapted and translated from the original German between 1967 and 1990 included many plays of Wolfgang Bauer. Original works included \"Theatre of the Absurd\" (1962), \"Absurd Drama\" (1965), \"Brecht: A Choice of Evils\" (1959), \"The Anatomy of Drama\" (1976), \"The Peopled Wound: The Work of Harold Pinter\" (1970), \"Artaud\" (1976) and \"The Age of Television\" (1981), \"The Field of Drama\" (1987), and several other essays, articles, and reviews.\n\nIn 1947, he married Renate Gerstenberg, and they worked together on many translations (some she did herself but they were published under his name in order to sell better). They had a child named Monica.\n\nEsslin died in London on 24 February 2002 at the age of 83 after having suffered from Parkinson's disease.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954843", "title": "State of Origin series", "text": "State of Origin series\n\nThe State of Origin series is an annual best-of-three rugby league matches between two Australian state representative sides, the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons.\n\nReferred to as Australian sport's greatest rivalry, the State of Origin series is one of Australia's premier sporting events, attracting huge television audiences and usually selling out the stadia in which the games are played. It is regularly described as being the pinnacle of rugby league, even in comparison with international competitions.\n\nPlayers are selected to represent the Australian state in which they played their first senior rugby league game. Before 1980 players were only selected for interstate matches based on where they were playing their club football at the time. In both 1980 and 1981, there were two interstate matches under the old selection rules and one experimental \"State of Origin\" match. From 1982 onwards a best-of-three match series has been played around the middle of the rugby league season for the State of Origin shield. During the early years the overall series results remained relatively even, however, Queensland surged ahead between 2006-2017, winning 11 out of 12 series.\n\nSince the 1908 establishment of rugby league in Australia, the sport's two major states, New South Wales and Queensland, have played representative matches against each other which have continued into the \"state of origin\" era which began in the 1980s. The two states' teams are frequently referred to as the Blues and Maroons, reflecting the respective colors of their jerseys. These were the colors of the Australia national rugby league team's jersey until the adoption of the green and gold. The Blues team is administered by the New South Wales Rugby League and the Maroons by the Queensland Rugby League. The New South Wales team are sometimes referred to by the nickname \"Cockroaches\" and the Queensland team as \"Cane Toads\", due to names given to them by Barry Muir and Johnny Raper respectively. It was reinforced by a marketing campaign used in the 1980s where the respective teams were caricatured as such.\n\nWhilst other Australian states also have representative rugby league teams, they have not competed in the State of Origin.\n\nThe first calls for a state of origin selection policy in interstate rugby football came before the schism between the union and league codes eventuated in Australia. In 1900 a journalist known as 'The Cynic' wrote in \"The Referee\" that star rugby player and recent immigrant to Queensland, Stephen Spragg, should be able to play for his home state of New South Wales.\n\nSince the beginning of Australian rugby league in 1908, an interstate competition between New South Wales and Queensland has been conducted from time to time. Until 1982 each team drew its players from the clubs based in that state. No consideration was given to the origins of the players themselves.\n\nThe first of these interstate games was played at Sydney's Agricultural Ground on 11 July 1908, before Queensland had even commenced its club competition. New South Wales easily accounted for Queensland in a 43–0 victory. The local media were unimpressed.\n\nThe interstate series was dominated by New South Wales, apart from a golden period for Queensland in the 1920s. From 1922 to 1925 Queensland defeated New South Wales 11 times in 12 matches. At the end of the 1925 season, a Kangaroo team was to be picked for touring Great Britain. Instead of announcing an Australian team dominated by Queenslanders, the Australian Rugby League Board of Control informed the media that the Rugby Football League had decided that the Kiwis would provide stronger opposition and that there would be no Australian tour. The period spanning 1922 to 1929 saw no Australian team play in Great Britain, the only such hiatus outside the two World Wars.\n\nThe New South Wales dominance of interstate football increased after 1956 when gaming machines were legalized for all registered clubs in New South Wales. This provided New South Wales football clubs with a revenue source unmatched by Queensland clubs. From this time on an increasing number of Queensland, players moved to the much stronger Sydney competition, becoming ineligible for Queensland state selection. Paul Hogan famously told a Queensland Rugby League gathering in 1977 that \"every time Queensland produces a good footballer, he finishes up being processed through a New South Wales poker machine.\"\n\nBefore 1956, NSW had won 75% and Qld only 25% of series played. From 1956–1981, NSW dominance soared even higher and Qld wins dwindled to only 3.8% with only 1 series win, in 1959.\n\nBy the 1970s the prestige of interstate matches had been seriously downgraded. Matches were played mid-week, so as not to interfere with the Sydney club competition, and the small crowds in New South Wales were hosted at suburban grounds. Interstate football reached its nadir in 1977 when the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) declined to host the Queensland team, and both interstate games were played in Queensland.\n\nFormer Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon, who had later become a journalist, was the first to suggest that Sydney-based Queenslanders should be available for selection to represent their state.\n\nBrisbane \"Courier-Mail\" reporter Hugh Lunn, Barry Maranta (the future co-founder of the Brisbane Broncos) and Maranta's business partner Wayne Reid played a part in persuading QRL chairman Ron McAullife that the concept could be used in rugby league. Lunn told McAullife that \"you can take the Queenslander out of Queensland, Ron, but you can't take the Queensland out of the Queenslander.\" McAuliffe was initially skeptical. \"What if we recall our boys from Sydney to play, and we are beaten. Where would we go from there?\" Reid spoke to NSWRFL president Kevin Humphreys and suggested that a one-off state of origin match could be used as a Test Match selection trial. \n\nNew South Wales clubs were reticent in their support of the concept and set two conditions:\n\nThree Sydney clubs remained opposed to the plan: St. George Dragons, South Sydney Rabbitohs and Eastern Suburbs Roosters. As these clubs were refusing to release players, Humphreys threatened to make the game an official Australian Rugby League trial, which would make release mandatory. The clubs backed down.\n\nAfter Queensland lost the first two interstate matches in 1980 (35–3 and 17–7, the second game in front of only 1,638 Sydneysiders) it was announced that a 'state of origin' match would take place on 8 July at Lang Park in Brisbane. The New South Wales media gave both the event and Queensland's chance of winning it, little credence, calling the game a \"three-day wonder\". Australia's 1978 captain Bob Fulton called the match \"the non-event of the century\". Ron MacAullife however, was now committed to the concept and vigorously promoted the match. Thousands of tickets were sold before the game had been officially sanctioned. Although interstate matches in Brisbane had still been well attended (24,653 had attended the opening match of the 1979 series), few expected the sell-out crowd of 33,210 Queensland rugby league fans, delighted to see their heroes in the likes of Arthur Beetson representing their home state for the first time. Queensland convincingly beat New South Wales 20–10.\nIn 1981 the first two interstate matches were again played under the old selection rules. As New South Wales won the first two matches in the series, state of origin selection rules were used once more in the third match. Although New South Wales ran out to an early 15–0 lead in the game, Queensland rallied to win 22–15.\n\nThe interest generated by the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 and the potential for financial rewards were enough to convince the authorities to play all three games under the state of origin rules the following year.\n\nDespite the Maroons' success so far in the State of Origin experiments, the New South Wales media dismissed the seriousness of the Queensland threat to the Blues' long-held dominance in series wins. Queensland however, under the leadership of immortal captain Wally Lewis, was inspired by this, and for the first three State of Origin series, Queensland won 2 matches to 1.\n\nHowever, in 1985, under the leadership of captain Steve Mortimer, New South Wales won the deciding match in front of 29,068 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground, claiming the series for the first time. The following year the Blues were able to go one better and complete the first state of origin whitewash, taking the series 3–0.\n\nAfter Queensland had won the 1987 series 2–1, a fourth game was played at Long Beach, California to showcase rugby league to the American public.\n\nIn \"Origin: Rugby League's Greatest Contest 1980–2002\" (2003) Queensland writer Jack Gallaway tells a story:\n\nIn 1987 the Australian Rugby League (ARL), New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League agreed that the match would only count towards the players' statistics. On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League (whose primary members are originally from the New South Wales Rugby League) announced that the fourth 1987 game was to be classified as an official match, and that a win in the state of origin match on 16 July 2003 would take New South Wales into the overall lead.\n\nARL and NSWRL chief executive Geoff Carr said: \"There had been some debate over whether the Origin fixture . . . in 1987 was counted as an official match but a search of ARL records has confirmed the status conferred on that clash by the game's governing body at the time. In announcing the match in Big League in April 1987, Ken Arthurson, the ARL's chief executive in 1987, was quoted as saying 'It's an exciting experiment but the match isn't and won't be billed as an exhibition match'.\"\n\nAfter the controversy of the match played in the United States, the Queensland halves pairing of Allan Langer and Wally Lewis led the Maroons in their 3–0 series wins in both 1988 and 1989. The rise of the Canberra Raiders in the then Winfield Cup club competition produced for the Blues the formidable halves combination of Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley who brought New South Wales back from defeat with two wins in the opening games of the 1990 series. It was evident that as the rivalry between the two states grew, the Origin matches had become much more physical forward orientated game than the open running play seen in earlier series.\n\nAs the great Queensland players from the 1980s began to retire from the game, the Maroons struggled with a team of fresh faces and considerable inexperience. 1992, 1993 and 1994 series all went to NSW as the talent and experience of Blues players such as Brett Mullins, Daley and Stuart in the backs and Benny Elias and Bradley Clyde in the forwards gave the Blues the edge when the games were on the line. It wasn't until the upheaval of the Super League war in 1995 that the Maroons were able to again clinch a series.\n\nThe main cause for concern for Queensland was the fact that the Brisbane Broncos, its players and many other Queenslanders were not aligned with the ARL prohibiting any players signed with the Super League to play for the Maroons. Despite this, the Queenslanders won the 1995 series 3–0 in a shocking white-wash. The 1996 series saw the off-field contract dramas put aside as all players were allowed, regardless of contract, state of origin selection. Having the majority of the Queenslanders back didn't help the Maroons though as the Blues 1996 white-wash with a 3–0 series win of their own.\n\nThe Australian game divided in 1997 into two competitions, one run by the ARL and one by the News Limited-owned Super League, and an interstate series was played in each. Under the Super League banner, there was a Tri-Origin series with a New Zealand side added to the competition. The ARL meanwhile stuck to its traditional format. The teams were selected using origin rules, and New South Wales and Queensland met twice. These matches do not count towards the official state of origin record. As with the premiership, players were spread between two representative tournaments as well.\n\nThe competitions merged again in 1998 as the current National Rugby League, and the series that year proved to be enthralling as both sides won a game each away from home, setting up a decider at the Sydney Football Stadium where 39,000 fans witnessed the visiting Queenslanders take the series 2–1. The end of the decade saw a dramatic series with each side taking one game each and game three ending in a draw. Queensland was awarded the series as at the time the previous winners retained the interstate honors.\n\nThe early to mid-2000s saw New South Wales starting to assert its traditional interstate dominance, causing some critics to question the future of State of Origin. However, this imbalance tipped in the third and deciding game of the 2006 State of Origin series, which is seen as the starting point of Queensland's unprecedented dynasty. Queensland followed by winning the 2007 series, as well as the 2008 series, which made Queensland's streak three series in a row. New South Wales won Game 1 on 21 May 2008, however, Queensland won Game 2 on 11 June 2008, and Game 3 on 2 July 2008. Queensland continued to follow this up by winning the first two games of the 2009 series becoming the first state to win four series in a row.\n\nIn 2010, Queensland won its historic, record-breaking, fifth consecutive Origin series with a 23–18 win in the third and final match. This was the first Queensland team to win all three consecutive State of Origin Games in 15 years. Queensland full back Billy Slater won the man of the match in the third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series in 2010. The 2010 State of Origin series was also the second televised program in Australia to be shot in 3D 1080i DVB-T as well as being simultaneously broadcast in regular 576i and 1080i DVB-T and PAL.\n\nIn the first game of the 2011 series, Queensland defeated New South Wales 16–12. In the second game, New South Wales defeated Queensland 18–8. Queensland won the series 34–24 in the 2011 decider in what was Queensland captain Darren Lockyer's 36th and final game. Cameron Smith won the man of the match in both the first and third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series.\n\nIn 2012, then NRL CEO David Gallop introduced the Under-20s State of Origin for Toyota Cup players which saw New South Wales winning. Queensland went on to win a historic 7th series win in 2012, winning the final game by 1 point.\n\nIn 2013, New South Wales defeated Queensland 14 to 6 in game 1, Queensland defeated New South Wales 26 to 6 in game 2, while in-game 3 Queensland defeated New South Wales 12 to 10 to take out the overall Origin title for the eighth consecutive time. The 2013 series set a new State of Origin television rating record for a whole series since the 2001 introduction of the rating system.\n\nIn 2014, New South Wales defeated Queensland 12-8 in the first game of the series, and 6-4 in the second. In the third game Queensland defeated New South Wales 32-8 after scoring the first try of the game in the 37th minute, with Queensland leading 6-2 in the first half. This gave the Blues the first series win in 8 years.\n\nIn 2015, Queensland defeated New South Wales 11-10 in game 1 played in Sydney, New South Wales defeated Queensland 26-18 in game 2 played in Melbourne, Queensland defeated New South Wales 52-6 in game 3 played in Brisbane, winning the series 2-1.\n\nIn 2016, Queensland defeated New South Wales 6-4 in game 1 and clinched the series with a 26-16 win in the second match. New South Wales closed off the series with an 18-14 win over Queensland.\n\nIn 2017, New South Wales won Game 1, 28-4 sparking the New South Wales media to start proclaiming the beginning of the Blues Dynasty. Queensland won Game 2, 18-16 after making changes to the team with the returning Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning goal for Queensland. Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match, essentially disabling it as he played out the whole match. Thurston was later ruled out for the rest of the year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a reconstruction, ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be his last representative year. In Game 3, New South Wales went in with an unchanged lineup for all three games, the first to do so since 1996. Queensland dominated the Blues, winning 22-6, with Queensland winger Dane Gagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series. It also had Johnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron Smith, before being chaired off the ground by his teammates, ending Thurston's representative career on a high note.\n\nIn 2018, New South Wales won their first State of Origin series in four years, defeating Queensland 22–12 and 18–14 in the first two games. Queensland scored a consolation victory 18–12 in the final game.\n\nIn 2019, Queensland defeated New South Wales in the first match 18-14. New South Wales then defeated Queensland 38-6 in the second and also won the third game 26-20. This was the first time since 2005 which New South Wales won a series decider and a consecutive series win.\n\nThe 2020 series was originally due to be played during the middle of the season, but was shifted to the post-season for the first time in history, due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced the suspension of all non-essential services in March. The series will be played on consecutive Wednesday nights in November, with venues for the three fixtures still to be confirmed.\n\nIn 2013, each individual game in the series drew a higher Australian television audience than any other sporting event. In recent years the series has gained popularity outside of New South Wales and Queensland, with games played in Melbourne drawing record crowds for rugby league and local television ratings comparable to those of some Victorian AFL matches. Internationally, the series is televised in 91 countries, and is a national obsession in Papua New Guinea, occasionally sparking riots, violence and deaths. It also draws a strong following in neighbouring New Zealand.\n\nWithin Australia, Nine Network is the main broadcaster for the series, with replays airing on Fox Sports. The series is also broadcast on radio by ABC Grandstand.\n\nSetanta Sports broadcasts live matches in Asia. In the United States, Fox Soccer televised all matches live using the Nine feed since 2011, with the coverage moving to Fox Sports 2 when Fox Soccer was discontinued in August 2013. Sky Sports broadcasts live coverage of State of Origin in the UK.\n\nRoy and HG's State of Origin commentary was once broadcast on Australian youth radio network Triple J. This broadcast was presented by the characters \"Rampaging\" Roy Slaven and HG Nelson (played by John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver), who commentated the game with a unique comedic style. Roy and HG's broadcasts began in the late 1980s and continued until 2008. Roy and HG moved from Triple J to radio network Triple M in 2009, at which point the duo ceased their State of Origin commentary.\n\nUnder State of Origin rules players were previously selected for the state in which they first played senior (or registered) rugby league. In 2012, the NSWRL, CRL, QRL and ARLC agreed on new criteria in determining Origin eligibility, to encompass other factors, such as place of birth. Players must also be eligible to represent Australia at international level.\n\nFrom time to time the selection of players under the State of Origin rules creates controversy. Since 1980, Queensland has completed just the 7 series with a team completely made up of players of a Queensland birth, while for New South Wales the total is only 6. However, the place of birth has only been a relevant factor in eligibility since 2012.\n\nAn issue of contention has been the selection of players such as Peter Sterling, Ken Nagas, James McManus, Israel Folau and Greg Inglis. Israel Folau was born and raised in New South Wales but is eligible to play for Queensland as he played his first senior rugby league match in Queensland. Ken Nagas was born and raised in Queensland but decided to play for New South Wales, Peter Sterling was born in Toowoomba, Queensland but raised in Wagga Wagga, Newcastle and Sydney, all in New South Wales, while McManus was born in Scotland and was raised in the Northern Territory, but was ruled eligible to play for New South Wales in the 2009 series.\n\nThe selection of Greg Inglis by Queensland was disputed. The Queensland Rugby League selected him based on the fact that either Wavell State High School or Brisbane Norths was Inglis' first senior football, making him eligible for both states per the rules at the time. However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High School in Newcastle, New South Wales, in the Arrive Alive Cup; considered to be a senior competition. Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said \"there was some talk the other day that he was brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday but I was the coach of the team. He played for us at 16, he's a Blue\". The controversy led to the creation of the \"That's In Queensland\" viral video.\n\nDue to the clarification of selection rules, the Sims brothers are eligible for different States. Tariq and Ashton are eligible for New South Wales while Korbin Sims is eligible for Queensland. Previously father and son combinations, such as Steve and Mat Rogers have represented different states. This duo was especially notable because Mat was born in New South Wales and played for Queensland while Steve was born in Queensland and played for New South Wales. Steve Rogers played his first senior game of rugby league for the Southport Tigers on Queensland's Gold Coast, in an NSW CRL competition.\n\nForeign-born players have also represented each state. New Zealand has had several players, such as Brad Thorn, Ben Te'o, Craig Smith, Willie Mason, Tonie Carroll, James Tamou and Karmichael Hunt play Origin. Tamou's selection by New South Wales in 2012 was controversial as he was born in Palmerston North and played for the Junior Kiwis, lived in New Zealand until he moved to Sydney when he was 13 and was included in the New Zealand national rugby league team training squad for the 2011 Four Nations. Both Hunt and Tamou played for Australia before being selected for the State of Origin. Other players, such as Sam Kasiano and Jason Taumalolo are also eligible, creating concern in the New Zealand Rugby League. Apart from representing Queensland, Brad Thorn is also a dual rugby international, having played international rugby league for Australia, and international rugby union for the All Blacks.\n\nPapua New Guinea-born Adrian Lam and Fijian-born Lote Tuqiri, Akuila Uate and Petero Civoniceva have also played Origin. Benny Elias was born in Lebanon and has played for and captained NSW. Mario Fenech was born in Malta and has played for NSW. The most recent case of a foreign-born player being selected was the selection of former Samoan international, Ben Te'o, by Queensland in game three of the 2012 season.\n\nA report into eligibility based on a player's birth state showed; \"Of the 18 series that QLD has won, it had the greater percentage of non-State [born] players in its side on 14 of those occasions – revealing a 77.8% dependency. Of the 13 series that NSW has won, on five of those occasions, it had a higher percentage of non-State [born] players across the series – revealing a 38.5% dependency.\"\n\n\nOf the 38 full series played, Queensland has won 21, New South Wales 15, with 2 series drawn (Queensland retained the Shield on both occasions as the previous year's winner). With the addition of three one-off games that were played in 1980, 1981 and 1987, the total number of games played is 117. Queensland have won 62, New South Wales have won 53, with 2 matches being drawn.\n\nThe series of 1999 and 2002 are considered drawn series, as both New South Wales and Queensland won a single game of each 3 match series, with the final game concluding in a draw. At that time there was no overtime rule to break the deadlock, and by the same set of rules, Queensland retained the shield as they were the previous holders, but did not win the series. Due to the controversy around the second drawn series, and the rule awarding the series champions to Queensland, the rules were subsequently changed to rule out drawn matches and series. Equal points at the close of full-time are now resolved with the golden point method.\n\nThe Wally Lewis Medal was awarded by the Queensland Rugby League for the Queensland player of the series from 1992 to 2003, when The Ron McAuliffe Medal replaced it as the Queensland exclusive award. From 2004 onwards it has been awarded to the player of the series irrespective of state, to the following players:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers still currently active are listed in bold.\n\nSource\n\nThe Under 20s State of Origin has only had eight seasons so far (2012 to 2019) with only one game a year, instead of three. New South Wales has won seven of the eight, with Queensland winning their first in 2018. They play for the Darren Lockyer Shield.\n\nThe Women's State of Origin is the Women's rugby league version of the game and has been running since 1999. The players play for the Nellie Doherty Cup. Furthermore, the current record for series won in the competition rests with Queensland, who won every series from 1999-2014, a better straight record than their male counterparts.\n\nQueensland: 1808 Points\n\nNew South Wales: 1842 Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1954845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954845", "title": "Kensuke Sasaki", "text": "Kensuke Sasaki\n\nSasaki is the first of two men ever to hold all three of \"puroresu\"'s major heavyweight titles (the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, and the GHC Heavyweight Championship), the other being Yoshihiro Takayama.\n\nSasaki debuted in Riki Choshu's Japan Pro-Wrestling - a satellite of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in February 1986. On February 16, 1986, Kensuke Sasaki made his debut against Shinji Sasazaki in a losing effort. Shortly afterwards, Kensuke Sasaki became a regular in All Japan Pro Wrestling for over a year before following Choshu who returned to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) in 1987. During that time, he teamed up with the likes of Osamu Matsuda and Kenichi Oya.\n\nIn January 1989, Sasaki embarked on an excursion to North America, where he first started wrestling in Puerto Rico in World Wrestling Council (WWC), where he held his very first championship, the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship, with Mr. Pogo twice between January 14, 1989 and April 1, 1989.\n\nIn January 1989, he started splitting his time wrestling in the WWC in Puerto Rico, with Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion in Canada, where he wrestled under the name Benkei Sasaki. He would also be trained in the Dungeon by Hart. During his time in Calgary, he won the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in August 1989, with All Japan loyalist Sumo Hara.\n\nHe also wrestled for Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) in tours of Austria and Germany under the name Kendo Sasaki.\n\nIn December 1989, Stampede Wrestling closed its doors, and Sasaki wrestled for the Canadian National Wrestling Alliance (CNWA), until March 1990 when he was fired by Ed Whalen for kicking Mike Lozanski too stiff.\n\nSasaki returned to NJPW in March 1990, and formed a popular tag team with Hiroshi Hase. He began teaming with Hiroshi Hase which whom he would have a long on and off tag team partnership with. They quickly won the IWGP Tag Team Championships on the 11th of November, 1990, defeating the team of Keiji Muto & Masahiro Chono. Holding the titles for only a month facing teams like Super Strong Machine & Tatsutoshi Goto, The Dragon Bombers (Shiro Koshinaka & Takayuki Iizuka) before eventually falling to Hiro Saito & Super Strong Machine on December 26 that same year. He would only win one more title with Hiroshi Hase a few months later, however that was very brief, lasting only 15 days. The pair would have two reigns as IWGP Tag Team Champions, and had memorable matches with The Steiner Brothers. \n\nTwo more tag title reigns followed when in late 1992, Sasaki assumed the name \"Power Warrior\" and teamed with Road Warrior Hawk. As The Hell Raisers, they dominated the tag team scene in New Japan. In October 1992, he also started wrestling periodically for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and would wrestle there on and off until December 1996.\n\nSasaki dropped the Power Warrior persona in 1995 (as he only revives the persona on special occasions, such as teaming with Hawk and Animal in six-man tag team matches) and began climbing the ranks in singles competition. He won his first major title, the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship on November 13, 1995, defeating Sting at a NJPW Event. This was the title's first title change outside of the United States. He soon lost the title to dubious circumstances however, losing to One Man Gang which was later claimed to be an official title match.\n\nAugust 1997 skyrocketed Sasaki's rise to superstardom. On August 3, he won the G1 Climax tournament by defeating Hiroyoshi Tenzan in the final. A week later, he captured the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Kazuo Yamazaki. Finally at the end of the month, he captured the IWGP Heavyweight Championship by defeating long reigning champion Shinya Hashimoto, winning three major honors in a one-month span. Sasaki solidified his dominance in the heavyweight division by defeating both Masahiro Chono and Keiji Mutoh in his first two title defenses, thus defeating The Three Musketeers in three straight title matches. In April 1998, he lost the title to Tatsumi Fujinami. In March 1999, he won another IWGP Tag Team Championship with Shiro Koshinaka.\n\nSasaki won his second IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Genichiro Tenryu while wrestling with a 39 °C (102.2 °F) fever. He won the G1 Climax for the second time in August 2000 with a victory over last year's winner Manabu Nakanishi in the final, now holding both of New Japan's two heavyweight singles crowns. On October 9, 2000, Sasaki surrendered the IWGP title after he lost to Toshiaki Kawada in a non-title match at an All Japan vs. New Japan event called \"Do Judge\". In a tournament final, Sasaki regained the title, defeating Kawada, at the January 4, 2001, Tokyo Dome show. In March 2001, Sasaki lost the IWGP Heavyweight Title to Scott Norton and in late 2002 he resigned from the promotion after a falling out with company management.\n\nIn the beginning of 2003, Sasaki joined his mentor, Riki Choshu, in his new Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling (World Japan) promotion. He became the only WMG Heavyweight Champion; however, tensions between him and Choshu over financial issues caused Sasaki to withdraw and the company to die a slow death.\n\nAfter leaving World Japan, Sasaki initially returned to NJPW in 2004 as a heel freelancer, with the New Japan roster, specifically Yuji Nagata unwelcoming of his return in kayfabe. In his return match, Sasaki lost to Nagata at Wrestling World 2004 by referee's decision in an extremely bloody contest. He later aligned himself with Manabu Nakanishi, who had recently began his \"lone wolf\" character. The two formed a tag team known as Pirates Gundan (Pirates Army), and regularly teamed with the likes of Scott Norton and Genichiro Tenryu. On March 12, he won back the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, defeating Hiroyoshi Tenzan in Tokyo. Sasaki dropped the title to Bob Sapp a little over two weeks later. After introducing his student Katsuhiko Nakajima and forming the Kensuke Family group, Sasaki began a redemption storyline where he attempted to win back the support of both the wrestlers and fans in NJPW. In August, he entered his first G1 Climax since 2002, but was prevented from reaching the finals by losing to Tenryu on the final day. By October, Sasaki was once again a firm fan favourite, and regained the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in controversial fashion, beating Kazuyuki Fujita in just 2:29 after reversing a sleeper into a pinfall. This win was legitimately protested by Sasaki and his wife Akira Hokuto, who destroyed the trophy given to Sasaki backstage and criticised Fujita for purposely dropping the championship so he could focus on MMA. Nevertheless, Kensuke successfully defended the belt twice against Hiroshi Tanahashi and Minoru Suzuki, before dropping it to Tenzan in December. After dropping the IWGP Title again, ally turned enemy Riki Choshu returned to NJPW in a backstage role which led to Sasaki's appearances became more sporadic, and he stopped wrestling for NJPW once again in early 2005.\n\nAfer returning to NJPW, Sasaki once again started wrestling for AJPW too as a freelancer, entering the 2004 Champion Carnival and making it to the final where he lost to Keiji Mutoh. After making occasional appearances throughout 2004, Sasaki went over to AJPW full-time in early 2005. On January 16, he unsuccessfully challenged Toshiaki Kawada for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, but saw success throughout the year, first winning the Champion Carnival by beating Jamal in the final. On July 26, Sasaki and his student Katsuhiko Nakajima then beat the Voodoo Murders (\"brother\" Yasshi and Shuji Kondo) to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. Kensuke (as his old \"Power Warrior\" character) and Road Warrior Animal teamed up on September 1 at the Differ Ariake to defeat Yasshi and Kondo. On November 19, Sasaki got another shot at the Triple Crown, this time losing to Satoshi Kojima. In July 2006, Sasaki suffered an injury and required time off, meaning he and Nakajima had to vacate the All Asia Tag Titles.\n\nAfter 5 months away from the ring, Sasaki returned to All Japan in January 2007. In May, Sasaki and Nakajima teamed up with rookie Seiya Sanada to win the Samurai! TV Triple Arrow Six Man Tag Team Cup, beating the Voodoo Murders (Kondo, Yasshi and Taru) in the final. On August 26, 2007, Sasaki defeated Minoru Suzuki to become the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion. Sasaki made his first defense against Toshiaki Kawada on October 18, 2007, and would go on to team with Kawada after Katsuhiko Nakajima suffered an injury on October 18 in the 2007 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. Sasaki and Kawada would lose a Finals Decision match against Satoshi Kojima and Suwama on December 9; both teams were tied, and opponents were needed for Keiji Muto and Joe Doering in the final of the League.\n\nSasaki successfully defended the Triple Crown Championship against Satoshi Kojima (on March 1, 2008). Sasaki participated in the 2008 Champion Carnival over five straight shows in the Korakuen Hall from April 5 to April 9, scoring 4 points after 1 win (over Joe Doering), 1 loss (to Minoru Suzuki) and 2 draws (with Suwama and Osamu Nishimura). Sasaki lost the Triple Crown Championship to Carnival Winner Suwama on April 29, 2008, and left the promotion in June.\n\nSasaki debuted for Pro Wrestling Noah in 2005, losing to Kenta Kobashi at Destiny 2005. After losing the Triple Crown titles in 2008, he jumped to Pro Wrestling Noah and announced he would make it his full-time home promotion, while still operating the Kensuke Office. On September 6, 2008, he defeated Takeshi Morishima for the GHC Heavyweight Title, becoming the first person to hold the Heavyweight title in all three major Japanese promotions. On March 1, 2009, he lost the GHC Heavyweight title to Jun Akiyama. On September 21, 2009, he teamed with Morishima to win the GHC Tag Team titles from Akitoshi Saito and Bison Smith. They lost the titles on December 6, 2009, to Takeshi Rikio and Muhammad Yone.\n\nSasaki teamed up with regular tag partner Takeshi Morishima to participate in the Global Tag League of 2010, which ran from January 9 to January 24. Sasaki and Morishima finished the league with a total of four points, losing out to A-Block winners Yoshihiro Takayama and Takuma Sano. Sasaki also participated in Pro-Wrestling NOAH's Global League of 2010 from March 28 to May 2. During the league, he defeated Jun Akiyama in a highly acclaimed contest. Sasaki finished with a total of seven points, losing out to eventual winner Yoshihiro Takayama.\n\nIn 2005, Sasaki established his own agency, Kensuke Office. The agency is run by Sasaki's wife (former joshi wrestler), Akira Hokuto. Under the Kensuke Office agency, Sasaki and pupil Katsuhiko Nakajima toured other promotions, particularly All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah (PWN).\n\nIn September 2006, Kensuke Office was announced as a member of the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA). Beginning in 2007, Kensuke Office has organised its own shows, and some of the talent featured on the shows include Minoru Suzuki, Jun Akiyama, Genichiro Tenryu, Yoshihiro Takayama, Kikutaro, Takeshi Morishima, KENTA and Catfish Man. In January 2012, Kensuke Office was renamed Diamond Ring. Currently, Diamond Ring serves as developmental territory of Pro Wrestling NOAH, featuring several of its superstars.\n\nOn February 11, 2014, Sasaki suffered his first loss to Katsuhiko Nakajima in the main event of a Diamond Ring event. Two days later, Sasaki held a press conference to announce his retirement from professional wrestling. Following Sasaki's retirement, Diamond Ring was left with only one remaining wrestler, Katsuhiko Nakajima, with Satoshi Kajiwara resigning and Mitsuhiro Kitamiya joining Pro Wrestling Noah.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2003, Sasaki took a couple hiatuses from puroresu and focused on mixed martial arts. He has two fights under his belt, winning both by submission in the first round beating Dan Chase in 2001 and future UFC fighter Christian Wellisch in 2003. In November 2002, he was originally scheduled to fight Minoru Suzuki, but due to injury, he pulled out and was replaced by Jushin Thunder Liger.\n\nDuring this period, he would alter his look, cutting his signature mullet (he would occasionally dye his hair different colors), wearing ring gear bearing the word, \"Volcano\", and adapting moves he learned in MMA training to expand his pro wrestling moveset.\n\nKensuke Sasaki married Akira Hokuto on October 1, 1995, after proposing to her on their first date. Together, they have two sons: Kennosuke (born November 1998) and Seinnosuke (born March 2003).\n\nAlso, Kensuke has a strong bond with his protégé Katsuhiko Nakajima, whom he considers to be a member of the family.\n\n"}

It was a development of the Fw 190C, a Fw 190A with a DB 603A engine.\n\nA project called Ra-4 was initiated in 1943. The idea was to create a new fighter derived from the Fw 190 for higher altitudes. In that sense it was a competitor for the Messerschmitt Me 155B project. The Ta 153A-1 would get the Jumo 213A or C engine and the new wings of the Fw 190B prototype. There was also the Ta 153D-1, a high-altitude version with long-span, high-aspect ratio wings and the DB 603G engine.\n\nAlthough derived from the Fw 190, the Ta 153 was essentially a new aircraft. This would have required a complete conversion of the production lines with new jigs and tooling. For that reason Kurt Tank decided to modify the existing Fw 190A by adding a rear fuselage 'plug', thereby creating the Fw 190D. Later this fuselage was mated with the long wings of the Ta 153D-1 for the successful Ta 152H.\n"}

He was promoted to passed midshipman on June 20, 1856. He served in the steam frigate in 1856-1857, and off Africa in 1857-1859 on board the corvette and the sloop of war . Promoted to Lieutenant on January 23, 1858, Meade was an officer of the steamer and sailing sloop of war , both units of the Pacific Squadron, during 1859-1861.\n\nAfter returning to the East Coast from the Pacific in mid-1861, Lieutenant Meade was hospitalized for a few months for a tropical illness, then provided gunnery instruction to volunteer officers as the Navy expanded to meet the challenges of the American Civil War. In January 1862 he became Executive Officer of the steam sloop and later held the same position on the new gunboat .\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant-Commander on July 16, 1862, Meade's subsequent Civil War service was distinguished, including participation in the suppression of the July 1863 New York Draft Riots, plus active combat and blockade enforcement work while commanding the Mississippi River ironclad in the latter part of 1862 and the gunboats in South Carolina waters in 1863-1864 and in the Gulf of Mexico during 1864-1865.\n\nMeade's post-Civil War career marked him as one of the Navy's most prominent reformist and technologically minded officers. Duty at the Naval Academy in 1865-1868 was followed by promotion to Commander and service along the Alaskan coast as Commanding Officer of the steamer . In 1871-1873 he took on a lengthy diplomatic and information-gathering cruise through the south Pacific. During the rest of the 1870s he served ashore at Washington, D.C., and New York. He attained the rank of Captain while commanding in the North Atlantic and West Indies in 1879-1882, then had additional shore duty and commanded the new dispatch vessel . Captain Meade was Commandant of the Washington Navy Yard in 1887-1890. Promoted to Commodore in 1892 and Rear Admiral two years later, his final service was as commander of the North Atlantic Squadron in 1894-1895.\n\nHis 1891 article \"George Meade, a Patriot of the Revolutionary Era\", was a \"hagiographic account\" that strongly influenced the reputation of his great-grandfather. He was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Society of Colonial Wars and the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\n\nMeade's early retirement in May 1895 followed a series of disagreements with the Navy Department. An article in the \"New York Tribune\" reported Meade as criticizing President Grover Cleveland, and quoted the sentence \"I am an American and a Union man, two things this administration can't stand.\"\n\nRear Admiral Meade died in Washington, D.C., on 4 May 1897 after complications following an operation for appendicitis.

He became a deacon at the age of 10, a priest at the age of 18, and a bishop when aged 28. He died at the age of 54 and was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul's Orthodox Church, Parumala, in Kerala, India. In 1947, he was declared a saint by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, making him the first canonised Christian saint from India. In 1987, the Syriac Orthodox Church also recognised him as a saint.\n\nGregorios was born in Pallathetta family in the Chathuruthy house at Mulamthuruthy near Cochin, India on 15 June 1848. His parents were Mathai Gheevarghese and Mariam Gheevarghese. He was called by the name ‘Kochaippora’ and was given the baptismal name ‘Geevarghese’. Geevarghese had two brothers and two sisters; Kurian, Eli, Mariam and Varkey. Geevarghese was the youngest.\nGeevarghese's mother died when he was a small boy and since then he was under the loving care of his elder sister Mariam.\n\nAt a very young age itself Geevarghese had shown keen interest in spiritual matters. His devotion, humility and above all his ability to sing the traditional Syriac hymns beautifully and perfectly, came to the notice of his uncle Malpan Geevarghese Kassiso. The uncle wanted his nephew to be raised to priest-hood and the family members who knew Geevarghese's character too agreed to the Malpan's request.\n\nAt the age of 9, on the 'Sleeba Perunnal' day (Feast of the Cross) of the year 1857 (Kanni 14, M.E.1033 / September 26, 1857), the then Malankara Metropolitan Mathews Athanasius ordained the young Geevarghese, a 'Kooroyo' (sub-deacon), at St. George Church, Karingachira.\n\nGregorios was taught by his uncle Kassisso Geevarghese Malpan and was ordained as a deacon on 14 September 1858 at the age of ten. He continued his training with Malpan until the latter died from smallpox. Gregorios was also infected with smallpox but survived. He was ordained as a priest in 1865 and as a Ramban (monk-priest) by Malankara Metropolitan Joseph Dionysios in 1872.\n\nOn 10 December 1876, the Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Peter IV, promoted the 28-year old Gregorios to be a bishop, at which point his official name became Geevarghese Mar Gregorios. His youth caused him to be referred to as \"Kochu Thirumeni\" (\"Young Bishop\").\n\nIn his bishopric, which was the Niranam Diocese, Gregorios established various churches and was the motivator to establish schools in different parts of Malankara. In the late 1890s, many educational institutions were started by the Malankara Church under the initiative and guidance of him and Joseph Mar Dionysius. Examples of these include St.Thomas School at Mulanthuruthy, St. Ignatius School at Kunnamkulam, and the Syrian English School (now known as MGM High School) at Thiruvalla.\nFollowing the death of fellow Metropolitans (bishops), the administration of Thumpamon and Kollam dioceses also passed to him. In 1887 the first block of the Parumala Seminary was consecrated.\n\nBy 1895, Gregorios had made Parumala his main spiritual centre. The church that he founded there in that year was consecrated in the names of St. Peter and St. Paul. He would wake at 4 am for prayer and he fasted on Wednesday and Fridays, as well as during Lent.\n\nGeevarghese visited Jerusalem in 1895. He visited almost all the important places of Christendom and led the Passion Week services at Syrian Church in the Holy City. On his return, he collected a certain amount from all the Parishes in Malankara and sent a Silver Cross as offering to the Holy church in Jerusalem.\nGregorios already had stomach ulcer and it became chronic in 1902. Treatments proved futile and he died on 2 November 1902. The funeral was conducted at Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's Orthodox Church, Parumala on 3 November 1902.\n\nIn 1947, he was declared a saint by the then Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan, Baselios Geevarghese II. \n\nGeevarghese Gregorios of Parumala (Parumala thirumeni) is the first person of Indian origin to be canonized as a saint and the first canonized saint of the Malankara Church.\n\nLater, in 1987, he was declared a saint by the then Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Zakka I Iwas.\n\n"}

As well as being a founder of the Broncos he is currently a Sky Shades president. His grandson Lachlan Maranta, became a Brisbane Broncos player.\n\nAn Old Boy of Marist College Rosalie in Brisbane and a former first grade cricketer and rugby league footballer, Maranta became a sports consultant and entered into a partnership with Wayne Reid, forming the organisation, International Sports Management. After seeing an interstate Australian Rules Football match that utilised \"state of origin\" selection rules in 1978, he started trying to convince Queensland Rugby League president Ron McAuliffe to instigate a similar concept in rugby league. This would ultimately have long-ranging effects as the State of Origin series phenomenon took off, becoming one of Australia's biggest sporting events.\n\nBy 1984 Maranta had been active in property development in Queensland for over fifteen years and was closely associated in business with former test cricketer and prominent Brisbane businessman, Greg Chappell.\n\nIn 1985 Barry Maranta expressed interest in fielding a Brisbane-based team in the New South Wales Rugby League's Winfield Cup premiership, the top-level rugby league football competition at the time. He was one of the principal owners of International Sports Management who had contributed to the advent of rugby league's State of Origin concept. In 1986 Maranta joined Paul Morgan, Gary Balkin and Steve Williams to form the Brisbane club. All men had played for Brisbane domestic teams. Four organisations made bids for the team which would be established in 1987. Ron McAuliffe, had the support of the NSWRL over the Maranta-Morgan group, other groups included 'International Syndicate' led by John Sattler and Bob Hagan, and one by Darryl van der Velde (who would later be CEO of the South Queensland Crushers).\n\nWhen the NSWRL decided not to have a Brisbane club in 1987, the groups went down, but in a final bid for the 1988 season, Both McAuliffe and Maranta-Morgan bid for the club. The NSWRL finally decided to have a Brisbane-based team and thus the Brisbane Broncos were born. The rights originally were going to go to the McAuliffe based group, but when it was realised they didn't have the funds to support the club, it was given to Maranta-Morgan.\n\nHowever the Maranta-Morgan group did not please everybody, especially Australian Rugby League chairman Ken Arthurson, who decided to add other (now defunct) Queensland-based teams, Gold Coast for the 1988 season and the South Queensland Crushers in 1995 season.\n\nMaranta was instrumental in the takeover of the ailing club in the English capital. London, who were founded as an offshoot of Fulham Football Club inside nine weeks and played their first competitive fixture in late August 1980, had a patchy existence until the company that owned the club went into receivership in the early spring of 1994.\n\nThe club, the only British professional rugby league club outside of the code's northern heartlands at the time, was run by the Rugby Football League whilst a new owner could be found. Maranta and his Brisbane colleagues saw London as a way into another top flight competition although London were playing in the second tier of British rugby league at the time.\n\nBrisbane completed their takeover of in April 1994 and the renamed London Broncos began life in the August of that year. The interest of Maranta's fellow board members was to prove short-lived however, and after London had been placed in the embryonic Super League (which was launched fully in the summer of 1996), his colleagues withdrew their interest. Maranta and fellow director John Ribot remained but Virgin Group founder Richard Branson took an initial stake in the club and later increased his holding to outright ownership after Maranta sold his interest in 1998.\n\nMaranta returned to Australia. The London Broncos made their only Challenge Cup Final appearance so far at the old Wembley Stadium in May 1999, Branson relinquished his interest in 2001 and the London Broncos brand was 'retired' in September 2005, becoming Harlequins Rugby League under the ownership of Ian Lenagan.\n\n"}

It is one of the largest indoor arenas in Asia, and it is also one of the largest clear span domes in the world. The dome measures approximately 108.0 meters making it the largest dome in Asia from its opening in 1960 until 2001 when it was surpassed by the Ōita Stadium in Japan with a dome measuring 274.0 meters.\n\nThe Smart Araneta Coliseum is mostly used for sports such as basketball. It is a main venue of the Philippine Basketball Association and for the basketball games of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines.\nThe Big Dome is also used for boxing, cockfighting, local and international concerts, circuses, religious gatherings, beauty pageants and more.\n\nIn 1952, J. Amado Araneta, a member of the Araneta family, purchased from Radio Corporation of America (RCA) of land in Cubao which includes the Araneta family home and is bounded by Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue or EDSA, Aurora Boulevard, P. Tuazon and 15th Avenue.\n\nThe Araneta Coliseum was constructed from 1957 to late 1959, and designed and built by Architect Dominador Lacson Lugtu and Engrineer Leonardo Onjunco Lugtu. From 1960 to 1963, the Coliseum received international recognition and was recognized as the largest covered coliseum in the world. Today, it remains one of the largest clear span domes in the world with a dome diameter of 108 meters. It occupies a total land area of almost and has a floor area of .\n\nThe coliseum opened on March 16, 1960, with Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde boxing for the World Junior Lightweight crown against Harold Gomes. General admission then was 80 centavos and the reserve section was five pesos.\n\nAmong the notable events to take place at the arena were the 11th and 34th FAMAS Awards, the 1975 \"Thrilla in Manila\" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, in which the arena was renamed into the \"Philippine Coliseum\", and the annual Binibining Pilipinas beauty pageant. The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) has played more than a thousand games at the Araneta Coliseum as of today. Other basketball events hosted by the arena were the 1978 FIBA World Championship, a game between the 1978 NBA champions Washington Bullets and a PBA selection in 1979, and the 1982 Asian Youth Basketball Championship where the Philippines defeated China in the final.\nIn the third quarter of 1998, the Aranetas and Pilipinas Shell (local arm of Royal Dutch Shell) started negotiations for a naming rights deal that would have lasted until 2008. The Aranetas, who wanted to retain their name at the arena rejected proposed name \"\"Shell Coliseum at the Araneta Center\"\". Instead, the parties agreed on a contract where Shell's name and logo will be painted at the arena's basketball court, a move that was almost shelved due to objections from other PBA teams because Shell owned the then-PBA team, the Shell Turbo Chargers.\n\nIn 1999, the coliseum underwent its first major renovation at the cost of P200 million. The major changes include the renovation of the lower box area, replacement of seats for the patron and lower box sections, and installation of a four-sided center hung scoreboard. The section names were also given numerical designations: 100 for Patron section, 200 for Lower Box, 300 for Upper Box A and 400 for Upper Box B. In 2006, a LED display was added to the scoreboard.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, the highest grossing event at the arena is the Pacquiao vs. Larios boxing fight between Manny Pacquiao and Óscar Larios, earning 96.2 million Philippine pesos. A concert by Westlife was attended by 17,887 people and earned 18.5 million pesos, while a Cliff Richard concert earned 17.2 million despite being watched by 5,647 spectators.\n\nPrior to the Ultimate All-Star Weekend in July 2011, it was announced that the Aranetas entered into a naming rights deal with mobile network operator Smart Communications, Inc. (a subsidiary of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company), renaming the arena into \"Smart Araneta Coliseum\". The deal was for five years and includes improvements the arena such as the installation of escalators to improve access in the upper box and general admission areas, and the construction of a parking lot that can accommodate up to 2,000 cars.\n\nAdditional improvements were made in 2012, including the renovation of the Red Gate entrance and the Green Gate side facade, and the replacement of Upper Box level seats, thus increasing its seating capacity. The Lower Box and Patron sections were combined to make a new Patron section (100 and 200 level seats). A pathway between the former Patron and Lower Box sections was also made. The former Upper Box A section (300 level seats) was renamed as Box section and the former Upper Box B section (400 level seats) is now referred as the \"Upper Box\" section.\n\nIn January 2015, the Hydra-Rib basketball backboard first used in 1995 was replaced with a Spalding backboard. The backboard was first used in Game 1 of the 2014–15 PBA Philippine Cup Finals.\n\nThe arena is primarily the home arena for the Philippine Basketball Association and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball leagues.

{"id": "1954896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954896", "title": "Sexuality in Star Trek", "text": "Sexuality in Star Trek\n\nSexuality has been a significant theme in the various Star Trek television and motion-picture series. Sexual relationships in \"Star Trek\" have mostly been depicted as heterosexual in nature. There have been depictions of bisexual relationships, but always with a twist (e.g. using versions of characters from a mirror universe instead of the \"real\" ones; female Trill Dax and Kahn in \"Rejoined\" had been a heterosexual couple in their former lives).\n\nInter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted. A comparatively broader range of views has been shown with respect to monogamy, polygamy, and the institution of marriage. In as much as sexuality can lead to reproduction, some plots have revolved around the possibility of children in a given inter-species relationship, as well as the prejudice that the resulting children have to endure from their parents' societies. The representations reflect contemporaneous attitudes to sexuality of American metropolitan culture, first during the sixties and then in later decades of the twentieth century.\n\nThe \"Plato's Stepchildren\" episode is often cited as the \"first interracial kiss\" depicted on television, between James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), but the reality is not so straightforward. William Shatner recalls in \"Star Trek Memories\" that NBC insisted their lips never touch (the technique of turning their heads away from the camera was used to conceal this); moreover, the episode portrays the kiss as involuntary, being forced by telekinesis. However, Nichelle Nichols insists in her autobiography \"Beyond Uhura\" (written in 1994 after Shatner's book) that the kiss was real, even in takes where her head obscures their lips.\n\nThe term \"interracial\" is used in this context to refer to black and white actors. \"Star Trek\" had also featured an interracial kiss between William Shatner and France Nuyen in \"Elaan of Troyius\" but had drawn no comment. Nancy Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. kissed in the 1967 NBC TV special \"Movin' With Nancy\" (though on British television, the event had happened earlier in both a 1964 episode of the prime-time hospital soap \"Emergency – Ward 10\" and in 1962 in a live televised drama, \"You in Your Small Corner\").\n\nDespite this, when NBC executives learned of the kiss they became concerned it would anger TV stations in the conservative Deep South. Earlier in 1968, NBC had expressed similar concern over a musical sequence in a Petula Clark special in which she touched Harry Belafonte's arm, a moment cited as the first occasion of direct physical contact on American television between a man and woman of different races. At one point during negotiations, the idea was brought up of having Spock kiss Uhura instead, but William Shatner insisted that they stick with the original script. NBC finally ordered that two versions of the scene be shot—one where Kirk and Uhura kissed and one where they did not. Having successfully shot the former version of the scene, Shatner and Nichelle Nichols deliberately flubbed every take of the latter version, thus forcing the episode to go out with the kiss intact. As Nichelle Nichols writes:\nThere were, however, few contemporary records of any complaints commenting on the scene. Nichelle Nichols observes that \"Plato's Stepchildren\" which first aired in November 1968 \"received a huge response. We received one of the largest batches of fan mail ever, all of it positive, with many addressed to me from girls wondering how it felt to kiss Captain Kirk, and many to him from guys wondering the same thing about me. Interestingly, however, almost no one found the kiss offensive\" except from a single mildly negative letter by a white Southerner. Nichols notes that \"for me, the most memorable episode of our last season was 'Plato's Stepchildren'.\"\n\n\"Star Trek\"s did not have any explicitly LGBT characters, although in 2005 George Takei, who portrayed helmsman Lt. Hikaru Sulu, came out as gay. In October 2011, Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the rebooted feature film franchise, publicly came out as gay. He explained that, after the suicide of bisexual teenager Jamey Rodemeyer, he realized \"that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality.\"\n\nRoddenberry once spoke of overcoming his own homophobia. In a 1991 interview with \"The Humanist\", he remarked:\n\nAccording to \"The Advocate\", Roddenberry promised that in the then-upcoming fifth season of \"TNG\", gay crew members would appear on the show. Other stars of the franchise chimed in, with Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock) offering his support in a 1991 letter to the \"Los Angeles Times\" saying, \"It is entirely fitting that gays and lesbians will appear unobtrusively aboard the \"Enterprise\"—neither objects of pity nor melodramatic attention.\"\n\nHowever, Roddenberry died soon after his interviews and the announced plans to have a gay crew member on \"TNG\" never materialized. Control of the \"Star Trek\" franchise fell to Rick Berman. While no gay crew members appeared on \"TNG\", was one episode that was intended to address the subject of sexual discrimination in the \"Star Trek\" universe. The episode featured Soren, a member of an androgynous race called the J'naii, who find the concept of gender primitive and offensive. Soren, unlike most others of her race, reveals to Commander Riker that she is inclined toward a female identity and is attracted to him. Riker and Soren begin a secret romantic relationship, and when her people discover this, she is arrested and subjected to \"psychotectic therapy\", by which she has all elements of gender eliminated, and loses her attraction to Riker. The episode was met with both praise and criticism from the LGBT community. In the case of the latter, criticism came from people who felt that it sanctioned the brainwashing therapy to which Soren was subjected, and others who felt that the creative staff abdicated their responsibility to exploring the issue. Actor Jonathan Frakes, who played Riker, also commented that the episode was not daring enough, in that Soren, who was played by Melinda Culea, should have been more evidently male.\n\nIn a 2008 interview, \"Trek\" writer Ronald D. Moore responded to a question of why there were few gay characters in science fiction in general and none on \"Star Trek\":\n\nWe've just failed at it. It's not been something we've successfully done. At \"Star Trek\" we used to have all these stock answers for why we didn't do it. The truth is it was not really a priority for any of us on the staff so it wasn't really something that was strong on anybody's radar. And then I think there's a certain inertia that you're not used to writing those characters into these dramas and then you just don't. And somebody has to decide that it's important before you do it and I think we're still at the place where that's not yet a common – yeah, we have to include this and this is an important thing to include in the shows. Sci-fi for whatever reason is just sort of behind the curve on all this.\n\nIn 2002, Kate Mulgrew (who played Captain Janeway) gave an interview to \"Metrosource\" where she spoke candidly about the issue of LGBT characters in the \"Star Trek\" television universe:\n\nBecause of its both political and potentially incendiary substance. I'm in a minority as well, as a woman. It took a lot of courage on their part to hire a woman. I think that right up until the end they were very dubious about it. It's one thing to cast a subordinate black, Asian, or woman, but to put them in a leading role means the solid endorsement of one of the largest studios in the world. And that goes for a gay character as well. It requires a terrific social conscience on their part and the pledge of some solidarity and unanimity, which I think is probably at the source of most of this problem to get every one of those executives on board regarding this decision.\n\nThat same year Mulgrew stated in an August 2002 interview for \"Out in America\":\n\nWell, one would think that Hollywood would be more open-minded at this point, since essentially the whole town is run by the gay community. It makes very little sense if you think about it. No, \"Star Trek\" is very strangely by the book in this regard. Rick Berman, who is a very sagacious man, has been very firm about certain things. I've approached him many, many times over the years about getting a gay character on the show--one whom we could really love, not just a guest star. Y'know, we had blacks, Asians, we even had a handicapped character--and so I thought, this is now beginning to look a bit absurd. And he said, \"In due time.\" And so, I'm suspecting that on \"Enterprise\" they will do something to this effect. I couldn't get it done on mine. And I am sorry for that.\nIn a 1990 \"Next Generation\" episode, \"\", Data creates Lal, an android daughter, and the other crew members seek to explain humanoid sexuality to her. According to \"TNG\" research consultant Richard Arnold, Whoopi Goldberg refused to deliver her character's dialog with a strictly heterosexual explanation:\nAccording to the script, Guinan was supposed to start telling Lal, \"When a man and a woman are in love...\" and in the background, there would be men and women sitting at tables, holding hands. But Whoopi refused to say that. She said, \"This show is beyond that. It should be 'When two people are in love.'\"\n\nBrannon Braga in 2011 spoke about the \n...constant back and forth about \"Well, how do we portray the spectrum of sexuality?\" There were people who felt very strongly that we should be showing casually, you know, just two guys together in the background in Ten Forward. At the time the decision was made not to do that and I think those same people would make a different decision now because I think, you know, that was 1989, well yeah about 89, 90, 91. I have no doubt that those same creative players wouldn't feel so hesitant to have, you know, have been squeamish about a decision like that.\n\nSuggesting that \"TNG\" in particular was under pressure from affiliates to be a \"family show\", Braga characterized the decision not to include LGBT characters as \"not a forward thinking decision\". Braga alluded to some episodes of \"TNG\" and one \"DS9\" episode featuring Dax as dealing with non-heterosexuality metaphorically.\n\nJ. J. Abrams, who rebooted the franchise with 2009's \"Star Trek\", said in 2011 that he was \"frankly shocked that in the history of \"Star Trek\" there have never been gay characters in all the series\". Including a gay character in the next film \"was not in the list of my priorities to try to figure out how to make this movie in the best possible way. But it will now be in the hopper.\" Abrams did not commit to including an identifiably non-heterosexual character but did commit to bringing the idea to the writers. Ultimately, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" did not include an identifiably LGBT character.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, it was announced that the film \"Star Trek Beyond\" would portray Hikaru Sulu as being in a same-sex relationship raising a daughter. This would make him the first main openly gay character in the \"Star Trek\" film franchise.\n\nThe 2017 series \"\" introduced and as the first openly gay characters in a \"Star Trek\" television series, as well as the first to be in a same-sex marriage. In \"Discovery\"'s , recurring character mentioned that she was married, but her wife died in a war. The actors portraying all three roles—Anthony Rapp (Stamets), Wilson Cruz (Culber), and Tig Notaro (Reno)—are openly gay. In the first season finale of \"\", Seven of Nine and Raffi are seen holding hands, clasping fingers romantically, and it was speculated by many based on their interactions that Seven had also been involved with the female villain Bjazl previously.\n\n\"\" (\"TNG\")\n\"Blood and Fire\" was commissioned to be written by David Gerrold but never actually filmed. Gerrold has stated that while many of the \"TNG\" cast and crew (including Roddenberry) were supportive of the storyline, the script's positive depiction of an openly gay couple met stiff opposition from the studio and the script never made it into production.\n\n\"\" (\"TNG\")\nIn 1992, the episode titled \"\" is a story in which Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) falls in love with Soren, a member of the androgynous J'naii species that views the expression of gender, especially sexual liaisons, as a sexual perversion. When the affair between Riker and Soren is discovered, the J'naii force Soren to undergo \"psychotectic\" therapy. Soren gets the chance to defend one's right to love regardless of sex, gender or lack thereof. Soren was played by actress Melinda Culea, and all of the main J'naii characters were played by women, a creative decision criticized by Frakes, who felt that Soren should have been played by a man.\n\n\nInstructions for authors that had previously wished to write officially licensed \"Star Trek\" spin-off books stated that there was to be no suggestion of a relationship \"other than friendship\" between crew members, but this restriction no longer applies.\n\nIn a seeming response to reams of Kirk/Spock fan fiction which began to dominate fan publications in the mid- to late 1970s, references to bisexuality occurred in Gene Roddenberry's 1979 novelization of \"\". In a foreword written by James Kirk, the Captain cleverly avoids confirmation or denial of a romantic relationship with Spock.\n\nIn 1972, \"Grup\", the first sexually themed \"Star Trek\" zine was published, to controversy in the fandom. In 1974 the first published \"Star Trek\" slash fiction was presented in \"Grup #3\".\nKirk/Spock fan fiction was the first prominent slash pairing.\n\nIn 2000, a group of \"Star Trek\" fans created their own low budget \"Star Trek\" series, \"\", and aired the episodes online. The series has included some gay crew members.\n\nWhen \"\" came to air, fans created the \"Voyager Visibility Project\" in an effort to persuade the series to have one of its crew-members established as having a gay or bisexual orientation.\n\nIn 2008, \"\" released a two-part episode adapted from David Gerrold's \"Blood and Fire\". It introduced two gay crew members into the cast. Ens. Peter Kirk, Captain Kirk's nephew, is depicted as being deeply in love with Lt. Alex Freeman, and the two plan to marry.\n\nIn 2005 Craig Young of GayNZ.com criticized the absence of any out core or supporting lesbian or gay characters from the various television series and films, although granting that the series was more inclusive of transgender issues through the narrative use of the Trill species and non-consecutive gender symbiosis. He argued that the continued invisibility and absence of such characters may well have led to growing rejection of the \"Trek\" franchise and spin-off media by gay and lesbian Trekkers. He compared it unfavorably to series like \"Doctor Who\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Babylon 5\".\n\nThe fan made , started in 2014, has published two story lines featuring LGBT characters. The first serial, \"No Good Deed\", involves an affair between the male captain and first officer. Science Fiction news site Io9's review of the comic said it tread ground the franchise rarely did, stating: \"What's especially refreshing is that [Captain Madison's] homosexuality is a part of his character, but not a focus of the plot.\" The third serial, \"Peace in Our Time\" stars a lesbian couple. TrekMovie.com reported the comic was \"doing real justice to the concept of IDIC.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954898", "title": "Madonna on Late Show with David Letterman in 1994", "text": "Madonna on Late Show with David Letterman in 1994\n\nMadonna made an appearance on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on March 31, 1994. The appearance was noted for an extremely controversial series of statements and antics by Madonna, which included many expletives. In particular, Madonna said the word \"fuck\" fourteen times during the course of the interview. This made the episode the most censored in American network television talk-show history while at the same time garnering Letterman some of the best ratings he ever received.\n\nMadonna's language and behavior—which was provocative, seemingly spontaneous at times, full of double entendres, and ended with a playful refusal to leave the set—caused a large public controversy. The Federal Communications Commission received numerous complaints about the language used on the show, echoing Letterman's (sarcastic) remark that she had to stop using the bad language \"because people don't want that in their own homes at 11:30 at night\".\n\nThis was not Madonna's first or last appearance with Letterman. She was a guest on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in 1988 with comedian Sandra Bernhard. This was, however, her first appearance since Letterman moved from NBC to CBS in 1993.\n\nWhen Madonna was a guest on the edition of \"The Late Show\" on March 31, 1994, it marked her first appearance on U.S. television that year. \nLetterman introduced Madonna right before she entered the set in this manner:\n\nPaul Shaffer responded \"she's your \"guest\"! ... Come on, she's your \"guest\"!\" to which Letterman responded, \"everything's fine, just relax, will ya?\" Madonna then entered the stage to the sound of her 1983 hit \"Holiday\", clutching a pair of her underwear, which she asked Letterman to smell during the interview. \"Wait a minute, aren't you gonna smell them?\" she said, to which Letterman replied \"I'll take care of that later,\" and Madonna complained to the audience \"I gave him my underpants and he won't smell them!\" This sketch made the headlines of the tabloids. The sketch was satirized in 2001 in the Italian late night show \"Satyricon\", where guest Anna Falchi actually took off her red panties on stage, and the host went all the way to smell them, which caused scandal in Italy.\n\nLetterman, following up from events earlier in the program, asked her to kiss a man in the audience; Madonna refused. Letterman expressed admiration for her not succumbing to the pressure. Madonna began smoking a cigar, and as he moved to another topic, Madonna interrupted him, in an opening salvo soon to be indicative of the random provocations to come: \"Incidentally, you are a sick fuck. I don't know why I get so much shit.\"\n\nLetterman steered his questioning toward her private life and, in particular, the singer's reported relationships with several NBA players. Madonna replied with a series of sexual innuendos, commenting \"that [overhead] microphone is really long\"; Letterman responded by talking about her friendship with Charles Barkley. When Letterman abruptly changed topic and asked about her nose ring in an ambiguous way (\"Did it hurt when you had that thing put in, uh, put in your nose?\"), Madonna laughed and said \"I thought you were going to ask me if it hurt something else ...\" which spurred a collective series of nervous laughter from the studio audience.\n\nPrior to the first commercial break (which Madonna objected to, citing that she wanted to \"break the rules\" and not conform to the constraints of American network television), the star asked Letterman if he was wearing a \"rug\"; never missing the opportunity for a joke, the host, referring to Madonna's short slicked-down hairstyle, replied by asking Madonna if she was wearing a swim cap.\n\nAfter the commercial break, Madonna told Letterman that he had changed since her last visit, that he was no longer \"cool\" or challenging to his guests, that \"Money's made you soft.\" Letterman asked her what was really bothering her; the star told the audience that she was angry that the comedian always (in Letterman's words – \"periodically\") made references to her sex life on the show.\n\nWhen Madonna continued to swear, the director cut to an elderly couple from Appleton, Wisconsin in the audience, visibly shocked by Madonna's language; this was followed by a video montage featuring Madonna-related comedy monologues.\nAfter a second commercial break, Madonna asked Letterman whether he had ever urinated in the shower, claiming it was an antiseptic to fight athlete's foot.\n\nDuring the interview, Letterman asked Madonna if she had a boyfriend (\"Are you currently interested in someone?\"). She responded that she did, and when asked what his name was, she replied, \"Dave.\" Letterman then attempted to deflect the obvious implication by asking her if she was talking about David Dinkins, the former mayor of New York.\n\nTowards the end of the interview, she also asked whether he had ever smoked \"endo,\" a slang reference to marijuana. Looking uncomfortable, the host told the singer that he had no idea what she was talking about; Madonna called him a liar which led Letterman to make light of the embarrassing question by acting like Johnny Carson.\n\nWhen Madonna refused to leave the set, there was jeering from members of the audience, including heckling to \"get off\". The home audience never saw Madonna leave her chair; instead, the show cut to a third commercial break, after which the singer was gone. Letterman said, \"Coming up in the next half hour, Mother Teresa is going to drop by.\" He then looked at an index card and joked, \"Oh, I see we've been canceled, there is no show tomorrow night.\"\n\nAnother guest, who was the United States Grocery Bagging Champion at the time, was scheduled to appear on the show that evening, but his segment was cut, due to Madonna refusing to leave the stage when her interview was over. Counting Crows concluded the show with a performance of \"Round Here\".\n\nMadonna later explained her behavior as a failed attempt to make a stand against television censorship, and made up with Letterman by having him escort her onstage at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. In an interview with Bob Guccione, Jr. in \"Spin\" magazine in the fall of 1995, Madonna further defended herself: \n\nIn a subsequent interview with \"USA Today\", Letterman noted how Madonna sent him a fax on his birthday, shortly after the episode aired. \"It was more of the same,\" he revealed. \"'Happy fucking birthday. Have a nice fucking day.' I know she was trying to be funny about it.\" The fax sent on April 12, 1994 reads:\n\nThe incident was widely referenced in popular culture. For example, in an episode of \"The Critic\" titled \"Sherman, Woman and Child\", Madonna is featured as a profane guest of \"Humphrey the Hippo\", a parody of \"Barney & Friends\". In the \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" episode \"Bobcat\", comedian Bobcat Goldthwait sarcastically comments to the character Moltar that Space Ghost's interview with The Ramones \"is going as well as the Letterman-Madonna interview.\"\n\nLetterman referred to the incident frequently in the short term afterward, usually as a disaster, even though it was a ratings bonanza. In one example, while raising the topic of Madonna's appearance, he added the subordinate clause: \"... or as I call it, Black Thursday ...\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Madonna's appearances on \"Letterman\" did not end. Madonna briefly appeared in a 1995 episode when she brought Letterman candy and flowers for Valentine's Day. She then proclaimed that, \"I'm a changed woman since I met you,\" to which Letterman excitedly exclaimed, \"Yes!\" Madonna then went on to add, \"And I'm not going to say 'fuck' anymore.\" In 1998, Madonna appeared briefly to announce number three on Letterman's top ten list that night – \"Ten Things Beautiful Women Love About Dave.\"\n\nOn November 3, 2000, Madonna returned for her first sit-down interview with Letterman since the 1994 incident to promote her new album \"Music\". The two of them discussed the previous interview, with a deal of humor and objectivity. Madonna chalked it up as a part of her \"rebellious period\", while Letterman admitted that he now understood how beaten up Madonna must have felt by the press during that time and that he contributed to that. Madonna then concluded that they were both having a \"weak moment\", which was met by laughter from both the audience and Letterman. Before the singer took stage to perform her latest single \"Don't Tell Me\", Letterman jokingly admitted that, \"I still have the panties. We had to put them in the vault upstairs, because people were trying to swipe them from me.\" An uncomfortable Madonna declared that, \"I won't rise to that bait.\"\n\nOn November 11, 2003, Madonna guested again to promote her children's book \"Mr. Peabody's Apples\". Before she entered, Letterman stated he \"just didn't want any awkward moments.\"\n\nOn January 11, 2007, Madonna appeared on Letterman to promote her latest film \"Arthur and the Invisibles\". The two joked about the 1994 episode. When David asked Madonna, \"What do you think about all these celebrities such as Britney Spears, not wearing their underwear?\", Madonna replied, \"It's freezing outside. Maybe you can give them to Britney.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2009, Madonna appeared for the last time to promote the greatest hits compilation \"Celebration\". During this episode, Letterman and Madonna again made light of her appearance on the show in 1994. The episode concluded with Letterman and Madonna going down the street and sharing a vegetarian pizza (minus cheese at Madonna's request) and martinis together.\n\n"}

He is best remembered for his years running the Queensland Rugby League, and his instrumental role in the formation of the State of Origin series.\n\nMcAuliffe attended school at St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace in Brisbane. In 1932 he played rugby league for the Gregory Terrace firsts. He started playing senior rugby league in 1937 for the Northern Suburbs club, but with the outbreak of World War II he joined the Australian Imperial Force. He served as a Warrant Officer for five years, before being honourably discharged after service in the Middle East and New Guinea with the 2/2 Casualty Clearing Station.\n\nAfter the war McAuliffe worked with the Queensland Railways Audit Office. Whilst living at New Farm he formed social bonds with a number of Valleys players. In the late 1940s he moved to Fortitude Valley's Brunswick Street, sharing a flat Roy Westaway, a former international representative playing for the Diehards. According to Australian rugby league hall of fame inductee Duncan Hall, who was also playing for Valleys:\n\nMcAuliffe was elected to the Valley's committee and became the club's delegate to the Brisbane Rugby League in 1951. In 1952 he was elected chairman of the Brisbane Rugby League.\n\nIn 1953 the Brisbane Rugby League was subsumed into the Queensland Rugby League (QRL). Ron McAuliffe became secretary to the organisation and began negotiations with the Brisbane City Council to lease Lang Park.\n\nOn 30 June 1971 McAuliffe was elected as a Senator for the Australian Labor Party in the Parliament of Australia. That year he also became president of the QRL. Although initially opposed to the idea, McAuliffe became a driving force behind the establishment of the State of Origin series. The 1980s were to prove a golden period for rugby league in Queensland.\n\nMcAuliffe sat in the Senate until 30 June 1981. At the end of 1981 he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nMcAuliffe died in August 1988 from a stroke. His funeral was held on 17 August 1988 at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Fortitude Valley and he was buried in Nudgee Cemetery. His pall bearers included then Australian and Queensland captain Wally Lewis. In his obituary \"The Courier-Mail\" journalist Barry Dick wrote that \"he [Ron McAuliffe] loved a drink, loved an argument, and most of all, he loved company.\"\n\nThe Ron McAuliffe Medal is awarded to each year's State of Origin Queensland player of the series. Lang Park's Ron McAuliffe stand was also named in his honour.\n\nIn 2009 McAuliffe was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.\n\n"}
