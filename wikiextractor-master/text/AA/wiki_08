Two days after being reported missing, Cobby's body was discovered on a rural farm in Prospect. Investigations led to the arrest of five men who were later convicted of her abduction, rape and murder on 10 June 1987 and each sentenced to life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, on 16 June 1987.\n\nAt the time of the killing, Cobby sustained multiple knife wounds and lacerations from barbed wire; her death was a result of a slit throat. The murder received widespread media coverage, condemnation, and attention.\n\nAnita Lynch was born in Sydney on 2 November 1959, to Garry Bernard Lynch, a graphic artist with the Royal Australian Air Force, and Grace \"Peggy\" Lynch, a nurse. As a teenager she participated in beauty pageants, including winning the Miss Western Suburbs Pageant in November 1979, and had a promising career as a model. However, she decided instead to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a nurse.\n\nShe met her future husband, John Cobby, while studying for her nursing degree at Sydney Hospital. They married on 27 March 1982. At the time of Cobby's murder in 1986, the couple had separated and Cobby was living with her parents in Blacktown, New South Wales. According to John Cobby, he and Anita were on good terms and, when she was murdered, had been planning to reconcile.\n\nCobby worked in Sydney and commuted daily from her home in Blacktown. On the day of the murder, she finished work at Sydney Hospital at 3 p.m. and met friends for dinner in nearby Redfern. Cobby then caught a train from Central railway station to Blacktown station. Arriving at Blacktown, she would usually ring her father who would pick her up. On the day of her death, she most likely decided to walk home after finding the phone to be out of order and no taxis available at the taxi rank. Aside from her killers, only two witnesses saw Cobby after she left the train station.\n\nCobby was walking alone from the station along Newton Road, Blacktown around 10 p.m., when the gang of five men drove up beside her and stopped their stolen white HT Holden Kingswood. Two men leapt from the car and dragged her into the vehicle, kicking and screaming. A 13-year-old boy, his younger sister and mother heard someone screaming from their house directly opposite and had gone outside in time to see Cobby forced into the attackers' car. The boy ran across the road to help, but the car drove off before he reached it. Returning home he telephoned the police to report what he had seen. A few minutes later, their neighbour and his girlfriend arrived home and, after being told of the abduction, drove off to search for the car. They eventually drove down Reen Road (now known as Peter Brock Drive), Prospect and stopped by the now-empty Holden, where he used a spot light to search the adjacent paddock. Seeing nothing in the paddock and believing the car he was looking for was a different model Holden, he decided to return home. The attackers later stated that they had hidden in the long grass to avoid the spotlight and waited for the man to leave.\n\nOnce inside the car on Newton Road, Cobby had been ordered to strip off her clothes but refused, begging her attackers to let her go and saying she was married and also menstruating. Her attackers punched Cobby repeatedly, breaking her nose and both cheekbones, before forcing her to perform fellatio on all five men. The attackers then drove to a service station to purchase fuel using money stolen from Cobby's purse. Cobby was then driven down Reen Road to the secluded paddock, while being held down in the car, raped repeatedly, and being continually beaten by her five attackers. They then dragged the brutally beaten Cobby into the paddock along a barbed wire fence, where they dumped her and continued to sexually and physically abuse her for some time. According to his taped confession, one of the attackers, John Travers, then became concerned that Cobby could identify them because she had seen their faces and heard their names, and convinced the other attackers to kill her. Urged on by the others, Travers slit her throat, almost severing her head.\n\nWhen Cobby did not return home, her family initially thought she was staying overnight with a friend, but after learning that she failed to appear at work the next day, they reported her missing on 3 February. On the morning of 4 February, her naked body was found in the paddock by a farmer investigating what his cows were milling around. Cobby's body was initially identified by her distinctive wedding ring, which was still on her finger when she was found. Her estranged husband John was initially suspected of her murder, but was quickly cleared.\n\nThe Australian public reacted with anger upon hearing details of Cobby's murder. On 6 February, the NSW state government posted a A$50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Cobby's killers. Also on 6 February, morning radio host John Laws obtained a leaked copy of Cobby's autopsy report, which contained explicit details of her injuries, and read it live on the air, both shocking and galvanising public sentiment. In a 2016 interview with \"Seven News\", Laws said he did it because he felt \"the general public ought to know\" and that \"it incited anger in the public that murders like this were happening and we weren't being given the full details\".\n\nOn 9 February, police re-enacted Cobby's movements on the night of her disappearance in the hope of jogging the memories of travellers or others who might have seen her. Constable Debbie Wallace wore similar clothing to Cobby and travelled the 9:12 p.m. train to Blacktown. Detectives interviewed the passengers and showed them photos of Cobby whilst Wallace walked the length of the train during the journey.\n\nFollowing a tip-off from a police informant regarding the stolen Holden, police started searching for Travers, Michael Murdoch, and brothers Les, Michael and Gary Murphy after they discovered that some of them had a history of violence, and that Travers had a reputation for carrying a knife. On 21 February, police arrested Travers and Murdoch at the home of Travers' uncle and Les Murphy at Travers' own house. Murdoch and Murphy were charged with offences relating to stolen cars and released on police bail. Travers, who admitted that he had stolen a car, made conflicting statements about the murder and was detained in police custody. While in custody, he requested that a friend be called so she could bring him cigarettes. The phone number was handed to the investigating police who contacted the friend, a woman.\n\nThe woman, Travers' aunt—eventually dubbed \"Miss X\"—agreed to help with the investigation, met with an officer, and gave him details of Travers' background. Miss X was subsequently sent back in to talk to Travers, agreeing to hide a recording microphone device in her bra while she visited him in his cell and was able to obtain a confession. Miss X later went to Murdoch's home while wearing the concealed recording device to capture his statements on tape as well. Eventually, five men were arrested and charged with the murder. Police were praised for their quick response in capturing all suspects involved. In total, 22 days had elapsed from the time of the murder to the time all suspects were taken into custody.\n\nThe five men charged, who later all pleaded guilty or were convicted of the murder, had over fifty prior convictions for offences including armed robbery, assault, larceny, car theft, breaking and entering, drug use, escaping lawful custody, receiving stolen goods and rape.\n\nJohn Raymond Travers, considered the ringleader of the gang, was raised in poverty in Blacktown, the oldest of eight children from unmarried teenage parents. By age 14, he was already an alcoholic, and was expelled from high school during Year 10 for being continually disruptive to other students. Beyond schooling, Travers held few jobs and relied mostly on unemployment benefits as a source of income. He was eventually committed to Boys' Town, a juvenile detention facility, by his mother. His father, with whom he never shared a close relationship, left the household in 1981. Finding it difficult to support the family, Travers relied on crime to provide food, stealing animals such as chickens and ducks from nearby households. The health of Travers' mother eventually deteriorated, and he and his siblings were sent to live with foster families while she was hospitalised. Travers had a history of violent sexual behaviour and bestiality. Witnesses have recounted that on several occasions, he had bought a live sheep for a barbecue and slit the animal's throat as he sodomised it before roasting its carcass on a spit.\n\nMichael Murdoch was a childhood friend and criminal associate of Travers. He had also spent a great part of his childhood in juvenile prisons, where he experienced sexual assaults. He was known to have written to politicians during this period of imprisonment seeking protection from such assaults.\n\nMichael, Gary and Les Murphy, three brothers from a family of nine children, were also accused of the crime.\n\n\nThe trial began in Sydney on 16 March 1987. Before proceedings began, Travers changed his plea to guilty. Sydney newspaper \"The Sun\" published a front-page story on the day the trial began, carrying the headline \"ANITA MURDER MAN GUILTY\" alongside a large image of Travers. The news story also referred to Michael Murphy as an unemployed prison escapee of no fixed address, and another in the same paper detailed Murphy's criminal convictions and his recent escape from Silverwater Correctional Centre, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for a string of burglaries and thefts. The jury was discharged due to the potentially prejudicial information published about Murphy.\n\nAccording to the medical examiner's report, Cobby's body showed extensive bruising on her head, breasts, face, shoulders, groin, thighs and legs consistent with \"a systematic beating\", including a \"blow of considerable force around the right eye\". She also had lacerations on her hips, thighs and legs from the barbed wire, several cuts to her neck resulting in the severing of her ear and windpipe and near decapitation, and many cuts to her hands and fingers, resulting in the near severing of three of her fingers, which likely occurred when she raised her hands to her face trying to protect herself from the knife. The medical examiner later testified that after Cobby's throat was cut, she would have died within two minutes. He also testified that some radio bulletins purportedly based on his own report contained misinformation about the type and extent of Cobby's injuries. She was not mutilated apart from the slashing of her throat and hands, there had been no attack with a knife on her stomach or genitals, and her shoulders had not been dislocated.\n\nThe trial for the remaining members of the gang lasted 54 days, with the men's defence relying on convincing the jury of their minimal involvement in the beating and murder. On 10 June 1987, all five were found guilty of sexual assault and murder. On 16 June, they were each sentenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to life imprisonment plus additional time without the possibility of parole. Justice Alan Maxwell described the crime as, \"One of the most horrifying physical and sexual assaults. This was a calculated killing done in cold blood. The Executive should grant the same degree of mercy they bestowed on their victim.\"\n\nCobby's parents would join forces with Christine and Peter Simpson, the parents of murder victim Ebony Simpson, to create the Homicide Victims' Support Group (Aust) Inc.—a community support group that helps families deal with heinous crimes. The Lynches also campaigned in seeking tougher sentencing and truth in sentencing laws, which eventuated after Cobby's murder. Cobby's father Garry Lynch died on 14 September 2008, aged 90, suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Her mother, Grace, died of lung cancer in 2013, at the age of 88. The Lynches had been married for 54 years at the time of Garry's death.\n\n, John Travers was housed in Wellington Correctional Centre in maximum security. In 1988 Travers was transferred to Maitland Gaol and was housed there until 1992, when Travers was transferred to Goulburn Correctional Centre. In 1996, he and another inmate were being transported from Goulburn to Long Bay Hospital at Long Bay Correctional Complex when they attempted to escape from the prison van by hacksawing through and kicking in the back door. When the attempt was noticed, the van pulled over at Bowral Police Station, and the two were arrested and charged. Travers was regularly kept in protection at the Goulburn because he was often involved in bloody fights with other inmates and threatening prison staff. From 2005 to 2015 Travers was housed in Lithgow Correctional Centre. Travers was eventually transferred to Wellington Correctional Centre.\n\nMichael Murphy was housed in Long Bay Correctional Complex in maximum security. In 1988, Michael was housed along with his brother Gary in the newly-built Special Protection Unit in Long Bay Correctional Complex. In 1992, he was transferred to Lithgow Correctional Centre, where he undertook Year 10 studies and did weekly work. A few years later Michael Murphy was transferred to Goulburn Correctional Centre, where he spent most his imprisonment and he usually kept to himself and stayed out of trouble. In May 2015, he was reclassified to medium security until July 2015, when he was reclassified back to maximum security. In September 2018 it was reported that he had terminal cancer and was living in palliative care. He died in Long Bay Hospital on 21 February 2019 at the age of 66.\n\n, Gary Murphy was housed in Long Bay Correctional Complex in maximum security. In 1988, he was housed along with his brother Michael Murphy in the newly-built Special Protection Unit in Long Bay Correctional Complex. A few years later, Gary Murphy was transferred to Maitland Gaol Correctional Centre, where he was housed till the prison's closure. In 2005 he was placed in Goulburn Correctional Centre and was housed there until June 2019. In mid June 2019 he was transferred from Goulburn to Long Bay Correctional Complex. On the morning of 25 June 2019, he was severely beaten by several other prisoners in shower block of 10 Wing in Long Bay and was transferred to hospital in a critical condition.\n\n, Les Murphy was housed in Goulburn Correctional Centre in maximum security. There were a long list of associates in the Goulburn Centre he was not allowed to have contact with. In 2005, he got into trouble for failing a urine test.\n\n, Michael Murdoch was housed in John Morony Correctional Complex in Windsor, New South Wales in medium security. He was formerly a maximum-security inmate at Goulburn Correctional Centre until December 1999 when he was reclassified to medium security and transferred to Bathurst Correctional Complex. In 2002, Murdoch was reclassified as maximum security and transferred to Lithgow Correctional Centre after an inmate feared that Murdoch would take his life. In 2008, while housed at Lithgow, Murdoch was investigated over an incident of a mobile phone being found in his cell block. He was reclassified as medium security and transferred to the John Morony Correctional Complex.\n\nAfter the death of Michael Murphy, as of 22 February 2019, NSW Corrective Services confirmed the 4 other offenders were still alive and were still serving their life sentences in various maximum security correctional centres across New South Wales but it couldn't be revealed where they're currently being housed.\n\nThe murder has been covered by several true crime television series, including \"Crime Investigation Australia\" in 2006, \"Crime Stories\" in 2008, and \"Australian Families of Crime\" in 2010. The case was covered by \"Casefile True Crime Podcast\" on 22 July 2017. It has also been the subject of several books (see Further reading).\n\nThe Australian social-realist film \"The Boys\" (1998), directed by Rowan Woods, is, in part, inspired by the Cobby murder and follows the journey of three brothers leading up to a similar crime.\n\nIn February 2016, at the time of the 30th anniversary of the murder, police released the taped confessions of Travers and Murdoch that were obtained by Miss X. \"Seven News\" broadcast a documentary, \"7 News Investigates: Anita Cobby — You Thought You Knew It All\", which included the newly released taped confessions and John Cobby's first televised interview about his wife's murder.\n\nA park in Sullivan Street, Blacktown was named Anita Cobby Reserve in memory of Cobby.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800094", "title": "UEFA coefficient", "text": "UEFA coefficient\n\nIn European football, the UEFA coefficients are statistics used for ranking and seeding teams in club and international competitions. Introduced in 1979, the coefficients are calculated by UEFA, who administer football within Europe.\n\nFor men's competitions (discussed in this article), three different sets of coefficients are calculated:\n\n\nWhile not discussed in this article, coefficients are calculated in a similar fashion for women's competitions such as the UEFA Women's Champions League, as well as for youth tournaments such as the UEFA Euro U-21 tournament.\n\nThe UEFA national team coefficient is derived from the results of each European national football team, and is only calculated by UEFA every second year in November; defined as being the point of time when all UEFA nations have completed the qualification stage of the upcoming World Cup or European Championship tournament.\n\nThe purpose of calculating the coefficients is to compile an official UEFA rank, to be used as seeding criteria for the European nations, when drawing up qualification groups and the final tournament groups of the European Championship. Previously, up until 2006, the UEFA national team coefficient was also used for the seeded draw of World Cup qualification groups in Europe, while the draw for final tournament groups of the World Cup was always seeded on the basis of the official FIFA World Rankings. UEFA stopped using UEFA national team coefficients for the seeding of World Cup qualification groups at the request of FIFA to only use the official FIFA ranking for all seeded draws related to the World Cup tournament.\n\nIt was first introduced in 2003 and used for seeding the 2004 European Final tournament and 2006 World Cup qualification. Until the end of the Euro 2008 tournament, the UEFA national team coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played, in the last two qualification rounds of the World Cup or European Championship. Results from the final tournaments, Play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored. In those cases where a nation did not take part at one of the two latest qualifying rounds, due to being directly qualified as a host, only one qualifying round would be taken into account.\n\nIf two or more nations ended up with exactly the same coefficient, the following ranking criteria was applied:\n\n\nThe last three times UEFA used this calculation method was for the final UEFA coefficients in 2003, 2005 and 2007.\n\nOn 20 May 2008, UEFA announced changes to the coefficient ranking system. The ranking will continue to be calculated every second year in November, but under the new system, teams now gain ranking points for each game played in the most recently completed full cycle (defined as all qualifying games and final tournament games) of both the World Cup and European Championship, with addition of ranking points for each game played at the latest completed half cycle (defined as all games played in the latest qualifying round). Ranking points for all games played inside those two and a half cycles, will be awarded according to the rules listed below.\n\n\nThe coefficients from 2017 used for the seeding and pot placements in the draw for 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, were calculated for each country by averaging:\n\nThe seeding and pot placements of the teams in the draw for the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League were based on the UEFA coefficients, determined on 11 October 2017, which are as follows:\n\nAfter the recalculation of the coefficient rankings for the 2007 cycle, Italy were ranked top following their FIFA World Cup victory in 2006. Runners-up France lay behind them in second place, followed by the Czech Republic. Spain overtook Italy to gain first place following their UEFA Euro 2008 win, with beaten finalists Germany moving into second; the Netherlands were third.\n\nSpain consolidated their top spot by winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the Netherlands jumping above Germany by finishing second in the tournament. In the 2013 rankings, Spain maintained top spot by winning their third major competition in a row - UEFA Euro 2012. Germany regained second, with the Dutch falling back to third place after failing to make it out of their group.\n\nGermany climbed to the top of the 2015 rankings as a result of their 2014 FIFA World Cup success; Spain dropped behind them. England reached their highest position in the rankings - placed third. Germany held on to top spot in 2017, with new European champions Portugal in second; Belgium were third.\n\n\nThe country coefficient is used to rank the football associations of Europe, and thus determine the number of clubs from an association that will participate in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\n\nThe UEFA ranking determines the number of teams competing in the season after the next, not in the first season after the publication of the ranking. Thus, the rankings at the end of the 2019–20 season determine the team allocation by association in the 2021–22 (not 2020–21) UEFA season. This is unrelated to the selection of teams which will fill each allocation through the individual association leagues and national cups (which is decided in the preceding year).\n\nThis coefficient is determined by the results of the clubs of the associations in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League games over the past five seasons. Two points are awarded for each win by a club, and one for a draw (points are halved in the qualifying and playoff rounds). Results determined by extra time do count in determining the allocation of points, but results determined by penalty-shootouts do not affect the allocation of points, other than for bonus points given for qualification into the latter rounds of the Champions League or the Europa League. The number of points awarded each season is divided by the number of teams that participated for that association in that season. This number is then rounded down to three decimal places (e.g. 2⅔ would be rounded to 2.666).\n\nTo determine a country's coefficient for a particular season, the coefficients for the last five seasons are added. Bonus points are added to the number of points scored in a season. Bonus points are allocated for:\n\n\nThe ranking below takes into account of each association's performance in European competitions from 2015–16 to 2019–20, with the 2019–20 season currently taking place.\n\nThe final ranking at the end of the 2019–20 season will be used to determine the number of places for each association in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League and the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\nAs of 12 March 2020 the coefficients are as follows:\n\nUEFA uses this coefficient system to decide which teams gain automatic entry to the group stage and which teams must go through qualifying. The teams who occupy the top four league places in the countries ranked 1 to 4 in UEFA competition gain automatic entry into the group stages for the following season’s Champions League competition, the top two teams of the country ranked 5 and 6, and the champions in the countries ranked 7 to 10. The Champions League and Europa League winners also get the chance to participate in the following season’s competition, guaranteed an automatic entry into the group stage.\n\nAccording to the UEFA regulations a National League needs to consist of at least eight clubs to be considered valid, otherwise no participants of such a league will be allowed to enter European competitions.\n\nThe original European competition, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, was limited to certain clubs and/or by invitation, so no coefficient calculation was necessary.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the UEFA Cup in 1971, the competition began to grow in complexity. UEFA began to publish rankings in 1979, to identify the number of participants for each country in the UEFA Cup.\n\nSubsequently, for statistical purposes, various rankings were introduced to portray the history of competitions. According to the prorated (extended) calculation system, only four leagues have succeeded in being ranked as the top European league.\n\nFollowing the Heysel Stadium disaster, all English teams were banned from UEFA competitions in 1985. The ban was only lifted after five seasons, with the knock-on effects continuing to impact on the First Division and then the Premier League for a total of nine years from 1986 to 1994. Having been top in 1985, England were un-ranked in 1990 and would not regain the top position until 2008.\n\nThe following data indicates the three top-ranked leagues in each five-year period. Data prior to 1975–1979 period has been calculated, but precedes the first published by the Confederation and has merely informative value.\n\nThe table shows the ranking of nations with respect to the total number of years in the top three of the rankings:\n\nThe ranking below takes into account of each association's performance in European competitions from 2015–16 to 2019–20, with the 2019–20 season currently taking place.\n\nThe final ranking at the end of the 2019–20 season will be used to determine the number of places for each association in the 2021–22 UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\nAs of 1 November 2019 the coefficients are as follows:\n\nThe following data indicates the three top-ranked women's leagues in each five-year period.\n\nThe table shows the ranking of nations with respect to the total number of years in the top three of the rankings:\n\nThe club coefficient is either the sum of the points earned by the club in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League over the previous five seasons or 20% of the club's association coefficient over the same period, whichever is the higher. Prior to the 2018 club rankings, teams received the sum of their points earned over the last five seasons \"plus\" 20% of the club's association coefficient.\n\nThe clubs receive two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a defeat in games of the main stages of the Champions League and the Europa League. Results determined after extra-time are included in this method, however results determined after penalty shoot-outs are not (the result is considered a draw). Bonus points for entering the Europa League group stage are not additional to win/draw points; they provide a minimum points allowance for participating clubs, whereas bonus points for entering the Champions League group stage (and those for qualifying to the knockout stage) are additional to win/draw points.\n\nQualifying round results are only taken into account if the team is eliminated in one of the rounds (see table below). Otherwise, the qualifying round results are taken into account only for the calculation of the association's coefficient and are halved. The clubs do not receive any points for elimination in the Champions League qualifying because those teams move to the Europa League and receive points from participation in that competition.\n\nThis ranking is used by UEFA to determine a club's seeding in club competition draws, including the preliminary and first rounds of the Champions League, and the preliminary, first and second rounds of the Europa League.\n\nBefore 1999 a number of strong teams in the UEFA Cup were seeded such that those teams did not meet in the first two rounds. To determine these teams, the sum of the ratio of the number of points achieved to the number of games played by each team, was calculated for the past five years.\n\nThe top 25 clubs as of 12 March 2020 are as follows.\n\nThe following data indicate the top-ranked clubs in each 5-year period. Data prior to 1975–1979 period has been calculated, but precedes the first published by the Confederation and has merely informative value.\n\nTop-rated clubs listed by number of times they were top-ranked over a 5-year period since the first period officially analysed (1975–1979):\n\nThe top 25 clubs as of 1 November 2019 are as follows:\n\nThe following data indicate the top-ranked women's clubs in each 5-year period.\n\nTop-rated women's clubs listed by number of times they were top-ranked over a 5-year period since the first period officially analysed (2001–2005):\n\nThe UEFA coefficient system has been criticised for being likely to preserve the status quo for rankings and seedings, as well as for favouring teams from stronger leagues.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800110", "title": "Colin Thubron", "text": "Colin Thubron\n\nColin Gerald Dryden Thubron, (born 14 June 1939) is a British travel writer and novelist. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked him among the 50 greatest postwar British writers. He is a contributor to \"The New York Review of Books\", \"The Times\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and \"The New York Times\". His books have been translated into more than twenty languages. Thubron was appointed a CBE in the 2007 New Year Honours. He is a Fellow and, between 2009-2017, was President of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nThubron is the son of Brigadier Gerald Thubron and of Evelyn (née Dryden), a collateral descendant of the poet John Dryden and of Samuel Finley Morse, inventor of the Morse Code. He was born in London and educated at Eton College. Before becoming a writer he worked for five years in publishing in London and New York City, and made independent documentary films that were shown on BBC television. He is married to the Shakespeare scholar Margreta de Grazia.\n\nThubron's first travel book, \"Mirror to Damascus\", was published in 1967, the first such book on the city for a century. It was followed the next year by \"The Hills of Adonis: A Quest in Lebanon\", a lyrical account of a journey through the country, pre-civil war, and the next year by \"Jerusalem.\" While starting a parallel career as a novelist, he completed a travel book on Cyprus, \"Journey into Cyprus\", in 1974, just before Turkey invaded the island.\n\nIn 1981, during the Brezhnev era, Thubron broke with his earlier work (on cities and small countries) and travelled by car into the Soviet Union, a journey recorded in \"Among the Russians\". This was followed in 1987 by \"Behind the Wall: A Journey Through China \"(winner of the Hawthornden Prize and the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award), and in 1994 by \"The Lost Heart of Asia\", the record of a journey through the newly independent nations of Central Asia.\n\nIn 1999 came \"In Siberia\"(Prix Bouvier, France), an exploration of the farthest reaches of the ex-Soviet Union, and in 2007, \"Shadow of the Silk Road\", which describes a 7,000-mile journey from China to the Mediterranean encompassing cultures that Thubron has been obsessed with: Islam, China, the former Soviet Union, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey.\n\nMost of Thubron's novels are notably different from his travel books. Several describe settings of enforced immobility: a mental hospital, a prison, an amnesiac's mind. Notable among them are \"Emperor\" (1978), a study of the conversion of Constantine, \"A Cruel Madness\" (winner of the PEN/Macmillan Silver Pen Award), and \"Falling\" (1989). Others, however, use travel or a fictional abroad: \"Turning Back the Sun\" (1991) and an imaginary journey to Vilcabamba in Peru: \"To the Last City \"(2002), long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. It has been described as a \"Heart of Darkness narrative\" in a \"Marquezian setting\". His most recent novel, \"Night of Fire\", is his most ambitious: a multi-layered study of time and memory, which several reviewers named his masterpiece.\n\nThubron says that he was influenced by \"Palgrave's Golden Treasury\" as a schoolboy, and was initially inspired by the travel writing of Patrick Leigh Fermor, Jan Morris and Freya Stark. He admires the English novelist William Golding and chose Victor Gollancz's anthology \"A Year of Grace\" as his book for \"Desert Island Discs\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800115", "title": "Air horn", "text": "Air horn\n\nAn air horn is a pneumatic device designed to create an extremely loud noise for signaling purposes. It usually consists of a source which produces compressed air, which passes into a horn through a reed or diaphragm. The stream of air causes the reed or diaphragm to vibrate, creating sound waves, then the horn amplifies the sound making it louder. Air horns are widely employed as vehicle horns, installed on large buses, semi-trailer trucks, fire trucks, trains, and some ambulances as a warning device, and on ships as a signaling device.\n\nAn air horn consists of a flaring metal or plastic horn or trumpet (called the \"bell\") attached to a small air chamber containing a metal reed or diaphragm in the throat of the horn. Compressed air flows from an inlet line through a narrow opening past the reed or diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, which creates sound waves. The flaring horn serves as an acoustic \"transformer\" to improve the transfer of sound energy from the diaphragm to the open air, making the sound louder. In most horns it also determines the pitch of the sound. When vibrated by the diaphragm, the column of air in the horn vibrates in standing waves. The length of the horn determines the wavelength of the sound waves generated, and thus the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the note produced by the horn. The longer the horn, the lower the pitch. \n\nLarger air horns used on ships and foghorns function similarly to a whistle; instead of a diaphragm the air escapes from a closed cylindrical resonator chamber through a precisely shaped slit directed against a knife edge (fipple). The air blowing past the knife edge oscillates, creating sound waves. The oscillations excite standing waves in the resonator chamber, so the length of the chamber determines the pitch of the note produced.\n\nIn trucks and buses, the air horn is powered with compressed air from the vehicle's air brake system. In trucks, a cord mounted on the ceiling of the operator's cab is pulled or in buses, a valve lever on the side of the dashboard is pushed down or pulled up to open the valve, supplying varying amounts of air to the horn. Thus, an outstretched hand reaching upward and pumping is a signal to the driver of an air horn equipped vehicle, requesting a toot. In modern trucks and buses, the horn is actuated by a button on the steering wheel (just like a normal car horn). Some trucks and buses have both electric and air horn, selectable by a switch on the dashboard. This is to prevent the use of the powerful air horn in populated areas.\n\nMany fire trucks, ambulances, and other large emergency vehicles operate air horns as a means of warning vehicles to clear the right-of-way.\n\nThere are also electronic horns for emergency vehicles, which produce a similar easily recognizable sound. These are typically integrated into the same system as the vehicle's electronic siren, and sound through the same speakers. In the last several decades, electronic sound systems with more widely varying frequencies have been chosen as common supplemental warning systems.\n\nOriginally, diesel locomotives were equipped with truck horns. After an accident in which a driver mistook a train for a truck, the need for a unique-sounding train horn became clear. Consequently, North American trains now have at least two horns with different tones forming the airhorn, that sound simultaneously, creating a harmonic interval or chord. Each individual horn is called a \"chime\". Three and five-chime configurations are the most common, but two chime horns also exist. \n\nFifteen to twenty seconds before entering a level crossing, federal law requires locomotives to sound their horns in a standard warning sequence. This succession consists of two long, one short, and one long horn sounding repeated as necessary until the locomotive clears the crossing. Exceptions to federal law occur in locations with established quiet zone ordinances that prohibit sounding locomotive horns.\n\nIn recent years, it has become a fad for car and truck enthusiasts to install large air horns on their vehicles. Some jurisdictions do not allow an airhorn to be attached, whether or not it can be activated.\n\nPortable air horns are also readily available packaged with a can of compressed gas as the air source. These are often sounded by fans at sporting events such as American football, basketball, hockey and association football, and at other events such as graduations, and political conventions.\n\nSmall versions are sometimes used as bicycle horns, since they yield a louder warning sound than traditional bicycle bells or bulb reed horns.\n\nAnother use is as a non-lethal weapon for self-defense, mainly as an auditory distraction to get away from an attacker. For outdoor activities like hiking, hunting, cross-country skiing, canoeing, fishing, an air horn can be handy to frighten away unwanted or aggressive wildlife, signalling for help and to announce one's location.\n\nAdditionally, air horns (especially those that contain fluorocarbons) have the potential to be abused as a substitute for recreational drugs since many such refrigerants can be inhaled for a quick and dangerous intoxication.\n\nThe air horn is used for signalling in various sports:\nNHL arenas normally employ two horns — a high-pitched horn (or a siren, as in the home arenas of the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens) that announces the end of the period (or the start of instant replay reviews), and a much louder, lower-pitched horn sounded when the home team scores and/or wins a game. Some MLB stadiums use horns for similar purposes, such as when a member of the home team hits a home run. In many places, air horns are used for signaling the end of the period or quarter on scoreboard systems. \n\nThe idea of a goal horn in NHL ice hockey is said to have begun in 1974, when Bill Wirtz, then-owner of the Chicago Blackhawks, liked the sound of the horn on his yacht so much that he had another example of it mounted inside of the team's home arena, Chicago Stadium, to be sounded whenever the Blackhawks scored a goal. \n\nIn mixed martial arts, an air horn is commonly used to signal the end of a round as opposed to the bell used in boxing and professional wrestling.\nHowever, CZW, GCW, and other independent wrestling companies allow air horns, while major companies such as WWE and IMPACT Wrestling have banned them.\n\nSamples of various air horns have been used by NHL teams when the home team scores a goal, often accompanied by music.\n\nThe air horn is also a popular sample in reggae music. Jamaican dancehall music was the first musical genre to use the effect, and has been using the airhorn sample for over 26 years, in live shows as well as on mixtape recordings, and in Puerto Rican reggaeton, a reggae hybrid genre since the late '80s and '90s. The sound effect has recently been used in hip hop music as well.\n\nThe \"Air Horn Orchestra\" gathered at the North Carolina Governor's Mansion every Wednesday for 30 weeks from April 13, 2016, until November 2, 2016, to protest the state's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also known then as House Bill 2, and Governor Pat McCrory by making a loud, disruptive noise. The 30th and final performance on November 2 was expected to set the Guinness World Record for the number of simultaneously sounding air horns, having had 342 participants. This was the last performance owing to the gubernatorial election six days later.\n\n"}

In 1919, the 17 different groupings and clubs formed a federation, the Greater German Association (\"Großdeutsche Vereinigung\"), led by the former Linz mayor Franz Dinghofer. As delegate of the Provisional Assembly, Dinghofer had been elected one of its three presidents on 21 October 1918, together with the Socialist Karl Seitz and the Christian Social politician Jodok Fink. Under his presidency, the assembly voted for the accession to the German Reich and declared German Austria a republic.\n\nOn a 1920 convention in Salzburg, the Greater German Association was transformed into a single party, the German nationalist and antisemitic Greater German People's Party. The only nationalist parties which did not join were the German Workers' Party and the rural Landbund. The party did not have a strong organisation but instead was supported by people who were nationalistic but not generally involved or interested in politics. The party received strong support from students, teachers and bureaucrats.\n\nThe party was strongly anti-semitic and supported the creation of a Volksgemeinschaft or people's community. They called for unification of Austria with Germany and free trade.\n\nDuring the First Republic the party never won more than 17% in elections. However, from 1921 to 1932, it was the junior partner of the Austrian Federal Government, in a coalition with the Christian Social Party, providing the Vice-Chancellors in the cabinets of Johann Schober, Ignaz Seipel and Rudolf Ramek. From 1927, the similar oriented Landbund took the Greater Germans' position as coalition partner.\n\nChancellor Johann Schober (in office 1921-22, 1930–31), although not a party-member, was considered to be close to the German nationalists. With the rise in support for the Austrian Nazi Party in the early 1930s, the Greater German People's Party lost numerous members to the Nazis and the paramilitary \"Heimwehr\" forces. On 15 May 1933, the party's radicalised remnants formed an action group (\"\"Kampfgemeinschaft\"\") with the National Socialists and eventually merged with the Nazi party during 1933-34. With the implementation of the Austrofascist dictatorship of the Federal State of Austria in 1934, all parties were banned. Upon the 1938 \"Anschluss\" to Nazi Germany, many former members joined the German Nazi Party.\n\nThe Greater German People's Party represented the Austrian \"Third Camp\" (\"Drittes Lager\") which traditionally has embraced pan-German nationalists and national liberals (in Austria \"German-Liberals\"). The Third Camp was revived after World War II in form of the Federation of Independents and later the Freedom Party of Austria.\n\n"}

The pharaohs of the Twenty-first Dynasty ruled from Tanis, but were mostly active only in Lower Egypt, which they controlled. This dynasty is described as 'Tanite' because its political capital was based at Tanis. Meanwhile, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes effectively ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name. The later Egyptian Priest Manetho of Sebennytos states in his Epitome on Egyptian royal history that \"the 21st Dynasty of Egypt lasted for 130 years\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800136", "title": "Falling Up (band)", "text": "Falling Up (band)\n\nFalling Up was an American Christian rock band from Albany, Oregon. Falling Up formed in October 2001, and released their debut album \"Crashings\" in 2004. They were signed to BEC Recordings in 2003 after a recommendation from friends in the band Kutless. The band's name came from the first song they wrote, which talked about their belief in both human imperfection and in the grace of God which compensates for that imperfection; their lyrics are heavily grace-themed.\n\nThe band went through several line-up changes, with only lead vocalist Jessy Ribordy, bassist Jeremy Miller, and drummer Josh Shroy appearing on every album .\n\nFalling Up debuted on February 24, 2004, with their 12-track album, \"Crashings\". Produced by Aaron Sprinkle. \"Crashings\" sold 3,396 units in its first week, which exceeded first-week sales of any other album in the history of BEC Recordings—displacing the previous record held by Kutless, who were childhood friends of Falling Up. \"Crashings\" sold over 50,000 units by the end of 2004. Three songs from \"Crashings\"—\"Broken Heart,\" \"Escalates,\" and \"Bittersweet\"—all reached No. 1 on the Christian rock charts at R&R.\n\nTheir second album, \"Dawn Escapes\", was released on October 25, 2005 through BEC Recordings. Produced by Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette (Chevelle, Cold), the album, though more melodic and hard rock-driven as a whole, did not majorly deviate from the sound of \"Crashings\". \"Dawn Escapes\" pushed Falling Up's lifetime record sales to over 150,000 by the summer of 2006. Guitarist Tom Cox left the band shortly before the album's release, eventually going on to form his own band, \"Archers Rise\", whose debut release was produced by Ribordy. He was replaced by guitarist Micah Sannan.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Falling Up released \"Exit Lights\", an album featuring remixes of the band's biggest hits and the new song \"Islander.\" Solomon Olds of Family Force 5, Thousand Foot Krutch's Trevor McNevan, and Randy Torres of Project 86 fame were among the artists who worked with Falling Up for the project. Guitarist Joseph Kisselburgh left the band in May 2006 to focus on his solo project, The Send, which released its debut album on Tooth & Nail Records in July 2007. Following Kisselburgh's departure, Hawk Nelson guitarist Jonathan Steingard filled in on rhythm guitar during the band's summer and winter tour dates before departing to maintain his role in Hawk Nelson. Kisselburgh was not officially replaced during this time period, with the band remaining a five-piece.\n\nThe band announced the release date for their next project, code-named \"Abandoners,\" on their Myspace page. Later on, they would announce the release name \"Captiva.\" The album was released on October 2, 2007. The first single from the album was \"Hotel Aquarium,\" followed by \"Goodnight Gravity,\" \"How They Made Cameras,\" \"Maps,\" and \"A Guide to Marine Life.\" They band also filmed a music video for \"Hotel Aquarium,\" which was featured in X 2008. After recording but before the release of the album, guitarist Micah Sannan departed Falling Up and joined the Christian hard rock band Disciple. Keyboardist Adam Taylor also departed around the same time to manage merchandise for Christian rock band Hawk Nelson. Daniel Elder soon joined the band as their new guitar player, reducing the band to a quartet.\n\nFalling Up's fourth studio album, \"Fangs\", was released March 24, 2009. According to their MySpace page, \"Fangs\" was to be their \"heaviest album yet\", something which was often disputed in the post-release period. It was also said that the album would be \"more of an arrangement than just a record that is put together randomly\", as well as that it \"[would] not have 14 great songs in entirety, but just intriguing moments and sections.\" One of the song titles, \"Lotus and Languorous\" was released early.\n\nAccording to BEC Recordings and Falling Up's Myspace, Falling Up headlined the Fangs! tour in late April early May 2009 with Tooth and Nail artist Ruth and Portland indie/rock artist Archeology. Unlike past tours, the venues on this tour were strictly secular.\n\nAfter the release of \"Fangs!\", band members Jessy Ribordy and Josh Shroy started a side project under the name \"The River Empires\", who created an album \"\"Epilogue\"\" with the help of The Dear Hunter's Casey Crescenzo, as well as a handful of other musicians. Jessy Ribordy also began working on a solo project, \"The Gloomcatcher\", releasing its first album, \"Slow Chorale\". The debut albums from both projects were released on April 6, 2010.\n\nOn January 20, 2010 lead vocalist Jessy Ribordy announced that Falling Up was \"taking a permanent break\", and their final show would be held at the Parachute Music Festival on January 29.\n\nOn October 22, 2010, the band updated their MySpace page with information that new music was \"in the works.\" The website FallingUpLives.com was then launched, followed by a Kickstarter campaign. Jessy explained on the website that the reason for the breakup was due to the band members wanting to explore other musical endeavors and the fact the BEC did not support the band's ideas for future releases. Jessy also stated that the band members did not feel comfortable about ending Falling Up so abruptly, leading to their decision to return making music, independently this time. \n\nOn January 21, 2011, Falling Up's Kickstarter campaign for their new album ended, having raised $13,665, more than their goal of $10,000. Rewards for the campaign included an exclusive download of two of Falling Up's demo songs, \"Phantasm\" and \"Monster Blood,\" both of which were tracks cut from their \"Captiva\" album, an exclusive T-shirt, signed copies of the new record, and cover songs performed by the band. The new record began recording on February 9, 2011, with Jessy Ribordy saying that the album would be released in June of 2011. On March 18, 2011, the band's website was updated with a logo displaying \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\", and a release date of June 2011. Shortly after, the band confirmed on their Facebook page that \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\" would be the title of the upcoming album. \n\nOn May 25, 2011, Falling Up released the first single for \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\", \"Blue Ghost\", on their ReverbNation page. On June 1, 2011, Falling Up released the second single, \"Diamnds\" also on their ReverbNation page. The two singles were generally well-received, with \"Diamnds\" being in the Top 20 most requested songs on ChristianRock.net during its first week. Although not officially released until June 28, \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\" reportedly arrived to those who had pre-ordered the album as early as June 23. When\"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\" was released on June 28, 2011, the album generally received very favorable reviews from critics. It was cited as being exceptionally creative, with a strong focus on originality and composure. Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album five out of five possible stars, as did New Release Tuesday. CM Addict gave it a slightly lower score of 8.5/10, citing that a couple of tracks \"are just so-so.\"\n\nThe same day as \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\"s release, Falling Up updated their website to fit with the theme of the album. A player was also added, allowing each track from \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\" to be played in its entirety. Prior to the album's release, it was stated several times by the band members that this would likely be Falling Up's last project, but that it may be dependent on the reception of with the upcoming album. With the album's release, they added a biography section to their website which implied that they were hoping to continue Falling Up, even 10 years after its inception.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\", Falling Up played their first live show since the \"Fangs!\" tour three years prior at the Hawthorne Theatre in Portland, Oregon on January 7, 2012. Ruth and Water & Bodies were the opening acts for the band.\n\nFalling Up announced in early January 2012 that a remix EP was in the works, and also said that they were hoping to have some new music released by the end of the year. On April 11, 2012, the band released \"Mnemos\", their first remix album since \"Exit Lights\".\n\nMnemos contained seven tracks on its own, and there were also three bonus tracks added when the album reached 1,000 downloads. The tracks found on the album were not full remixes, but repetitions of hooks found in the various sections of \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\". At the time of Mnemos' release, Falling Up was only able to remix songs from \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh\", due to BEC holding the rights to their previous songs.\n\nThe Mnemos EP was released on Groupees through the \"Feed Them with Music\" program, a charity which provides a meal for a needy family for every download. All of Falling Up's profits from the EP were donated to this program. Within the first 24 hours of the album's release there were over 1,500 downloads.\n\nFalling Up's next project was teased as \"The Machine De Ella\" project. The project was eventually revealed to consist of two albums, \"Hours\" and \"Midnight on Earthship\", as well as an audio book, also titled \"Hours\", written by Jessy Ribordy. The idea for the project came when the band considered their two different fanbases. \"Hours\" was recorded as a concept album based on the book within the project, and was more rock-driven. \"Midnight on Earthship\" was recorded with a sound and lyrics more along the lines of their Christian roots, with its songs being more faith-based. Both of the albums and the book began their launch on October 9, 2012, and were progressively released over the course of three months.\n\nIn August 2014, Falling Up initiated a Kickstarter fundraiser for their tenth full-length album that raised over $48,000, exceeding the $40,000 goal. During the Kickstarter campaign, Falling Up announced that this would be the band's final album. On November 13, 2015, Falling Up released their final studio album, the self-titled \"Falling Up\" to critical acclaim.\n\nOn June 10, 2016, Falling Up released a two-song EP titled \"Reimagined\" to follow through on a reward tier from their Kickstarter campaign. It consisted of two recreated songs, \"Broken Heart\" and \"Arafax Deep\", which originally debuted on the band's first album, \"Crashings\". In early 2017, the band released their final song, a reimagined cover of Brand New's \"Gasoline.\"\n\nFinal lineup\n\nFormer\n\nTouring musicians\n\n\n"}

By 1834, he had served on the Brazil Station and in the West Indies and Mediterranean squadrons. From 1834 to 1841, he was engaged in coastal survey work and during the mid-40s was attached to the Bureau (Depot) of Charts and Instruments at the Naval Observatory.\n\nDuring hostilities between the United States and Mexico, he was attached to the Home Squadron and served off Tabasco and Tuxpan on the brig USS \"Washington\". In the 1850s, he commanded the steamer \"Walker\" in the Gulf of Mexico on coast survey duty and invented a deep sea sounding apparatus and other hydrographic instruments. In 1861, Sands served on west coast survey duty as commander of the \"Active\". Commissioned captain in 1862, he joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron as commander of \"Dacotah\" in 1863.\n\nIn February of that year, Sands participated in the engagement at Fort Caswell. He remained off the Carolinas for another two years, commanding the steamer \"Fort Jackson\" during the attacks on Fort Fisher. In February 1865, he was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and assigned to duty off the Texas coast. Through the end of the American Civil War, he commanded a division off that coast; and, on June 2, 1865, took formal possession of Galveston, Texas for the Union.\n\nAfter the war, Sands, appointed Commodore in July 1866, served at the Boston Navy Yard until returning to Washington, D.C. as Superintendent of the Naval Observatory. Commissioned Rear Admiral on April 27, 1871, he remained at the Observatory until he retired in 1874.\n\nRear Admiral Sands belonged to a prominent military family. His uncle, Lt. Col.

French. Their son, James H. Sands, also achieved the rank of Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy and served as Superintendent of the Naval Academy, while another son, George Henry Sands (1855–1920), was a colonel in the US Army and served in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Two other sons, William F. and Francis P. B., also served in the Navy. A daughter, Marion, married Rear Admiral Samuel Rhoads Franklin. Sands' eldest brother, Lewis Hook Sands (b. 1805), was a colonel in the US Army and served as an Indian agent in the Midwest. A nephew, James Hook Sands, was a captain in the Indiana Cavalry during the Civil War who later served in the regular army during the Indian Wars.

{"id": "1800148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800148", "title": "Kirkdale Cave", "text": "Kirkdale Cave\n\nKirkdale Cave is a cave and fossil site located in Kirkdale near Kirkbymoorside in the Vale of Pickering, North Yorkshire, England. The cave was discovered by workmen in 1821, and was found to contain fossilized bones of a variety of mammals not currently found in Great Britain, including hippopotamus (the farthest north any such remains have ever been found), elephant, and the remains of numerous cave hyenas. William Buckland analyzed the cave and its contents in December 1821: he determined that the bones were from the remains of animals brought into the cave by hyenas who had been using it for a den, and not a result of the Biblical flood floating animal remains in from distant lands as he had first thought. His reconstruction of an ancient ecosystem from detailed analysis of fossil evidence was admired at the time, and considered to be an example of how geo-historical research should be done.\n\nThe cave was extended from its original length of to by Scarborough Caving Club in 1995. A survey was published in Descent magazine.\n\nThe fossil bones found in the cave included elephants, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, hyenas, bison, giant deer, smaller mammals and birds. This is the northernmost site in the world where hippopotamus remains have been found. It also included a considerable amount of fossilized hyena faeces. The fossilized remains were embedded in a silty layer sandwiched between layers of stalagmite.\n\nThe discovery at Kirkdale occurred in the wake of new forms of stratigraphic dating developed during the Enlightenment. As was the case for many nineteenth century fossils, the bones in Kirkdale were originally found by local inhabitants. The entrance to the cave was found by limestone quarry workers in the summer of 1821. The quarry workers assumed that the abundant bones buried in the cave floor were the remains of cattle that had been dumped in the cave after dying from some past epidemic. They used some of the bones to fill potholes in a nearby road, where an amateur naturalist noticed them and realized that they were not the remains of livestock. This attracted the attention of numerous fossil collectors. Some of the fossils were sent to William Clift the curator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons; he identified some of the bones as the remains of hyenas larger than any of the modern species. At the same time, William Buckland was told about the cave and shown some of the fossils by a colleague at Oxford.\n\nBuckland began his investigation believing that the fossils in the cave were diluvial, that is that they had been deposited there by a deluge that had washed them from far away, possibly the Biblical flood. However, upon further investigation, he realized that the cave had never been open to the surface through its roof, and that the only entrance that had ever been open to the outside world was too small for the carcasses of animals as large as elephants or hippos to have floated in. He began to suspect that the animals had lived in the local area, and that the hyenas had used the cave as a den and brought in remains of the various animals they fed on. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that many of the bones showed signs of having been gnawed prior to fossilization, and by the presence of objects which Buckland suspected to be fossilized hyena dung. Further analysis, including comparison with the dung of modern spotted hyenas living in menageries, confirmed the identification of the fossilized dung.\n\nHe published his analysis in an 1822 paper he read to the Royal Society. A few days before reading the formal paper, he gave the following colourful account at a dinner held by the Geological Society:\nHe developed these ideas further in his 1823 book \"Reliquiae Diluvianae; or, Observations on the organic remains contained in caves, fissures, and diluvial gravel, and on other geological phenomena, attesting the action of an universal deluge\", challenging the belief that the bones were brought to the cave by Noah's flood and providing detailed evidence that instead hyenas had used the cave as a den into which they brought the bones of their prey.\n\nCalcite deposits overlying the bone-bearing sediments have been dated as 121,000 ± 4000 yr BP using uranium-thorium dating, confirming that the material dates from the Ipswichian interglacial.\n\nThe specimens were an original part of the archaeology collection of the Yorkshire Museum and it is said that \"the scientific interest aroused founded the Yorkshire Philosophical Society\". While criticized by some, William Buckland's analysis of Kirkland Cave and other bone caves was widely seen as a model for how careful analysis could be used to reconstruct the Earth's past, and the Royal Society awarded William Buckland the Copley Medal in 1822 for his Kirkdale paper. At the presentation the society's president, Humphry Davy, said:\n\nThe cave is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Geological Conservation Review site.\n\nThe Saxon St Gregory's Minster with its unusual sundial is nearby.\n\n"}

This intimate experience with the Australian landscape – its expansiveness, its dramatic changes, and its \"indescribable energy\" – had a profound influence on her future as a composer. She began composing while still at Maneroo, at the age of eight, for the resources she had available: recorder and voice. She moved to Canberra aged 11, and although she was pleased to be reunited with her mother, she missed the beauty of the outback terrain.\n\nIn New South Wales, she received her education at Albury High School and Hornsby Girls' High School.\n\nBoyd studied music at the University of Sydney, where she was one of Peter Sculthorpe's first students. Sculthorpe had a profound influence on her; she said that his music was the first time she had heard music which expressed her experience of the Australian landscape. In the early 1970s she and Sculthorpe were engaged to be married, but they broke the engagement as they believed one composer in a household was enough. After receiving her Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree, she received a PhD in composition from the University of York in England.\n\nIn 1990, Boyd became the first Australian and the first woman to be appointed to a professor of music at the University of Sydney. Before that Boyd was the foundation head of the Department of Music at the University of Hong Kong (1981–90) and taught at the University of Sussex (1972–77). In 1996 she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for her contributions to music as a composer and as an educator.\n\nBoyd's struggle to maintain funding for music courses in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sydney was featured in the documentary \"Facing the Music\" (2001). The Department of Music was incorporated into the Sydney Conservatorium at the same university from the start of 2005.\n\n\nMany of Boyd's compositions have an East Asian influence, especially the music of Japan (such as the wood flute and the Japanese mode) and Indonesia (such as the gamelan orchestra and the Balinese modes). Many of her works are of a spiritual or meditative nature, such as the a cappella work \"As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams\" (1975). She has written song cycles, opera, piano, choral, orchestral and chamber music. Her musical compositions include: \"Goldfish Through Summer Rain\" 1979, \"The Little Mermaid\" 1980, \"Black Sun\" 1990, \"Revelations of Divine Love\" 1995, \"Meditations on a Chinese Character\" 1996, \"A Vision: Jesus Reassures His Mother\" 1999, and \"YuYa\" 2005. CD's include: \"Meditations on a Chinese Character\" 1997, and \"Crossing a Bridge of Dreams\" 2000.\n\nBoyd is an endurance runner and marathoner, regularly winning her age group in marathons, half marathons and 10 km races. Boyd ran her first marathon after only 18 months training. She has been described as a 'lady of musical and running talents' and an 'inspiring distance runner', running with her daughter and raising money for cancer. She won her age group in the Sydney Striders marathon trophy.\n\n"}

{"id": "1800197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800197", "title": "The Seeds of Doom", "text": "The Seeds of Doom\n\nThe Seeds of Doom is the sixth and final serial of the 13th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 31 January to 6 March 1976. \n\nIn the serial, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) agrees to go on one final mission in his role as UNIT's scientific advisor to investigate a mysterious pod found in the Antarctic. However, the crazed millionaire and plant collector Harrison Chase (Tony Beckley) is also interested, and has sent his violent henchman Scorby (John Challis) and the botanist Arnold Keeler (Mark Jones) to acquire the malignant alien plant for his personal collection.\n\nIn Antarctica, British scientists Charles Winlett and Derek Moberley discover a pod buried in the permafrost and take it back to their camp. John Stevenson, the base botanist, identifies it as vegetable-based and estimates it has been buried in the ice for twenty thousand years.\n\nIn London, Richard Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau shows the Fourth Doctor photographs of the pod at the urging of his superior, Sir Colin Thackeray. The Doctor believes it to be extraterrestrial. He tells Dunbar to tell the expedition not to touch it until he arrives.\n\nBack at the base, Stevenson discovers that the pod is growing larger and he believes it is absorbing ultraviolet radiation. In England, Dunbar visits the estate of millionaire Harrison Chase, who considers it his mission to protect the plant life of Mother Earth. Dunbar gives Chase the location of the pod. Chase sends his men, Scorby and Keeler, to retrieve the pod.\n\nAt the base, the pod opens and stings Winlett. When Stevenson and Moberley find him, Winlett's face is covered with green hives. The Doctor and Sarah arrive at the base, and find that Winlett's face and body are rapidly becoming covered with green fungus. Outside the base, the Doctor uncovers another pod and notes that they travel in pairs. Winlett's blood is found to contain no blood platelets, but instead has schizophytes – microscopic organisms akin to plant bacteria. The Doctor tells Sarah that Winlett is turning into a Krynoid, a galactic weed that settles on planets and eats the animal life. Scorby and Keeler arrive, claiming that their private plane got lost.\n\nMoberley is killed by the mutated Winlett. Transformed into a Krynoid, Winlett flees the base and shelters in the outside generator hut. Scorby and Keeler steal the remaining pod, then escape in their plane. The Doctor and the others are attacked by the Krynoid, which kills Stevenson. The Doctor and Sarah flee the base as a bomb set by Scorby and Keeler destroys the area. The Doctor and Sarah are picked up by a team from South Bend, while Scorby and Keeler return to Chase in England with the second pod. Dunbar warns Chase that the Doctor and Sarah are still alive and are scheduled to meet with him and Sir Colin in two hours.\n\nAt the meeting, the Doctor and Sarah describe the theft of the pod. He tells Dunbar to arrange for him to go to the Botanic Institute. As they leave a driver meets them. However, the limousine stops in the countryside, and the driver orders them out at gunpoint. The Doctor jumps the driver and punches him out. The Doctor and Sarah search the car and find a painting by Amelia Ducat, a flower artist. When they visit her, Ducat tells them that the owner of the painting is Harrison Chase, who never paid her for it.\n\nChase orders Keeler to inject the pod with fixed nitrogen. When the Doctor and Sarah try to sneak into the mansion, they are captured and brought before Chase, who decides to show them around the mansion and his plant laboratory before he executes them. When Scorby escorts the Doctor and Sarah into the gardens to kill them, the two overpower him. Sarah escapes but is captured again. The Doctor rescues her and in the confusion, a frond from the pod stings Keeler's arm. Keeler soon begins to transform.\n\nWhen the Doctor returns to the laboratory, he is captured and taken to the compost room, where Scorby activates the crusher. Meanwhile, Sarah escapes back to the house, attracts Ducat's attention and asks her to take a message to Sir Colin. Outside, Ducat enters a car with Sir Colin and Dunbar inside and tells them what Sarah said. Dunbar, realising he has made a terrible mistake, says he will get the Doctor. He tells Sir Colin that, if he does not return in half an hour, to return to London and call UNIT.\n\nSarah turns off the crusher in time to save the Doctor. Hargreaves finds that Keeler has almost completed his transformation and runs in a panic as the creature frees itself. In the mansion, Dunbar pleads with Chase to abandon the experiment as Hargreaves reports Keeler's transformation to Chase. Dunbar goes to get help and is pursued by Scorby.\n\nThe Doctor realises that Keeler is missing, and goes with Sarah to search for the Krynoid. Dunbar runs into the monster and is killed. His screams attract the attention of Scorby and the guards as well as the Doctor and Sarah. They escape to a cottage and barricade themselves in. The Krynoid speaks using Keeler’s voice, demanding that the Doctor join it and it will spare the others. Scorby throws a Molotov cocktail at the Krynoid, allowing the Doctor to escape. Chase makes his way through the grounds and confronts the Krynoid. It notices him and he approaches, taking photographs.\n\nThe Doctor arrives at the Bureau, where UNIT Major Beresford warns he can’t do anything without evidence. The Doctor shows reports of people near Chase’s estates being killed by plants. He then calls Sarah and tells them Beresford is preparing to attack the Krynoid with a laser gun, but the Krynoid cuts the phone wires. Chase arrives and tells them that it’s the plants’ world, and humans are parasites. He goes to the manor to develop his photographs, then begins speaking to the plants in his greenhouse.\n\nScorby, Sarah, and Hargreaves confront Chase, and he speaks of how the world will be made perfect. Sarah notices that the plants are closing in on them. The Doctor and a UNIT soldier drive onto the grounds while the plants overwhelm Sarah and the others and start to strangle them.\n\nThe Doctor and UNIT Sgt. Henderson arrive with chemical plant-killer. They dispose of the plants, saving Scorby and Sarah, but Hargreaves is killed. Chase runs away, and the Doctor and the others go into the lab and start removing the plants. Once they're outside, Chase locks the door behind them and they watch as the now enormous Krynoid towers over them. UNIT soldiers arrive and open fire with their laser gun, distracting the Krynoid so that the Doctor and his group can get to another door.\n\nAfter they leave, Chase slips back into the laboratory and destroys the loudspeaker system. The others return to the laboratory, and the Krynoid tries to break in. Meanwhile, Chase puts Henderson in the compost machine and activates it, killing the unconscious soldier.\n\nThe Doctor works to repair the loudspeaker system as the Krynoid renews its attack, and Scorby panics and runs. He makes his way across a pond, but the plants grab and pull him underwater, killing him.\n\nThe Doctor and Sarah realise that Henderson is gone, and Sarah goes to look for him. She makes her way to the compost machine room, and Chase confronts her, telling him he’s become part of the plant world thanks to the Krynoid. Chase plans to support the Krynoid and refers to humanity as parasites, then attacks Sarah and knocks her unconscious.\n\nBeresford contacts the Doctor, who warns they have 15 minutes until the Krynoid germinates, spreading its seeds across England. The Doctor tells them to launch an air strike before it’s too late.\n\nChase has tied up Sarah and starts feeding her into the compost machine. The Doctor arrives and shuts off the machine. In the ensuing struggle, Sarah is saved, but Chase is pulled into the machine.\n\nThe RAF launches a sighting run as Beresford and Sir Colin look for the Doctor. Sarah and the Doctor cannot get out through the plant life covering the house, but the Doctor rigs a steam pipe and they blast their way out. They make their way through the hostile plant life and take refuge as the RAF opens fire and destroys the Krynoid and the mansion.\n\nScorby quotes Voltaire's line \"when it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion\", but the Doctor seems to attribute it to Franklin Pierce Adams.\n\nThe serial was written by established television writer Robert Banks Stewart, who was influenced in the writing of this ecological tale of rampant flora by his home abutting Kew Gardens as well as his familial connection to botanist Joseph Banks. The Doctor's dialogue with Amelia Ducat about the car boot and model is an homage to Oscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\". After a long association with \"Doctor Who\", this story was director Douglas Camfield's last involvement with the show.\n\nLocation shooting at Chase's estate took place at Athelhampton Hall in Dorset. This is the third serial of the programme to shoot exterior location scenes on Outside Broadcast (OB) videotape rather than film; the previous two were \"Robot\" (1974) and \"The Sontaran Experiment\" (1975). On 7 December 1975, whilst location filming the closing scene outside the TARDIS at Buckland, the TARDIS prop collapsed on Elisabeth Sladen; it was the original prop used since 1963.\n\nNone of the established UNIT characters are seen in this story (the last regular appearance of the organisation), as Nicholas Courtney was unavailable to reprise the role of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\n\"The Seeds of Doom\" was one of the \"Doctor Who\" serials which drew criticism from Mary Whitehouse for violent imagery. She wrote, \"Strangulation – by hand, by claw, by obscene vegetable matter – is the latest gimmick, sufficiently close up so they get the point. And just for a little variety show the children how to make a Molotov Cocktail.\"\n\nIn \"The Discontinuity Guide\", Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as \"an \"Avengers\" episode in disguise\" and called it \"another gem, and one much benefitting from an excellent performance from Tony Beckley as Harrison Chase\". In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised how the story was split between two settings and the monster in general, though they felt some aspects of the Krynoid were \"rubbish\". They wrote that the only real disappointment was UNIT, which contained none of the old characters and as a result \"[came] across as a faceless and characterless bunch whose sole function in the story is to resolve the situation\". \n\nIn 2010, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" awarded it five stars out of five, describing \"The Seeds of Doom\" as \"a rich, classy serving, with plenty of meat accompanying the vegetables\" and arguing that \"the archive-raiding of the Holmes/Hinchcliffe era reaches its zenith here.\" He praised Baker, the guest actors and their characters. However, he acknowledged that it was \"an abnormally violent outing\" and believed that the plot contained a \"giant crevasse\" in that \" it takes a ridiculous amount of time for the Doctor et al to know how to tackle the Keeler-Krynoid, having seemingly forgotten that the Winlett-Krynoid was killed by an explosion\". \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Christopher Bahn said that the serial was \"one of the greats\" of the era, particularly praising the pacing and Baker's performance. \n\nDVD Talk's Ian Jane gave \"The Seeds of Doom\" four out of five stars, calling the script \"a good one\". Ian Berriman of \"SFX\" gave the story five out of five stars, writing, \"Often bleakly grotesque, blessed with an eerie, mournful score and shot with real brio, this is a rare Who six-parter that you can consume in one sitting, with nary a moment of boredom.\" He also was positive towards the performances of Beckley and Baker.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Philip Hinchcliffe, was published by Target Books in February 1977. A slightly \"Americanized\" version of Hinchcliffe's novel was released as #10 in the Pinnacle Books series in March 1980 with a foreword by Harlan Ellison and a cover illustration by David Mann\n\n\"The Seeds of Doom\" was released on a double VHS in 1994 in the United Kingdom. In North America it was released as a single VHS. The story was released on DVD on 25 October 2010 in the United Kingdom, and on 8 March 2011 in the United States. Music from this serial was released on the CD \"\". This serial was also released as part of the \"Doctor Who\" DVD Files in Issue 120 on 7 August 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "1800205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800205", "title": "Fighting American", "text": "Fighting American\n\nFighting American is the title character of a patriotically themed comic book character created in 1954 by the writer-artist team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Published by the Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics, it was, contrary to standard industry practices of the time, creator-owned. Harvey Comics published one additional issue in 1966. One final inventoried tale was published in 1989, in a Marvel Comics hardcover collection of all the Fighting American stories. \n\nSubsequent publishers have had short runs of Fighting American stories with the permission of the owners' estates. The character gained some notoriety due to a lawsuit in the late 1990s when Awesome Entertainment founder Rob Liefeld announced intentions to publish a mini-series that was allegedly similar to that artist's run on Marvel's Captain America title. After settling the dispute, Awesome released three Fighting American series.\n\nBitter that Timely Comics' 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, had relaunched their hero Captain America in a new series in 1954, the writer-artist team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created another patriotically themed character, Fighting American. Simon recalled, \"We thought we'd show them how to do Captain America\". While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti-Communist dramatic hero, Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue, in the aftermath of the Army-McCarthy hearings and the public backlash against the Red-baiting U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy. Simon specified for a panel audience at the 1974 New York Comic Art Convention that the character was not so much inspired by Captain America as it was simply a product of the times.\n\nSimon said in 1989 that he felt the anti-Communist fervor of the era would provide antagonists who, like the Nazis who fought Captain America during World War II, would be \"colorful, outrageous and perfect foils for our hero.\" He went on to say,\nPublished bimonthly by the Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Group, \"Fighting American\" lasted through issue #7 (May 1955). The following decade, for Harvey Comics, Simon packaged a single issue of \"Fighting American\" (Oct. 1966) consisting of \"reprints and unpublished material\" from the 1950s run, with some changes made to comply with the since-instituted Comics Code. A final inventoried \"Fighting American\" story, the three-page \"The Beef Box\", not drawn by Kirby, appeared in Marvel Comics' 1989 hardcover collection of the 1950s and 1960s stories.\n\nThe character was revived by Titan Comics in a new series starting in October 2017.\n\nIn the 10-page story \"First Assignment: Break the Spy Ring\" in \"Fighting American\" #1 (May 1954), Nelson Flagg was the unathletic younger brother of star athlete and war hero Johnny Flagg, and served as the writer for popular TV news commentator Johnny at station USA. When outspoken anti-Communist Johnny is killed by one of the many enemies his commentary has earned him, Nelson makes a deathbed promise to hunt down his brother's murderers. Recruited for the U.S. military's \"Project Fighting American\", Nelson has his mind and life force transferred to Johnny's \"revitalized and strengthened\" corpse. Assuming Johnny's identity, he adopts the costumed alter ego Fighting American to battle Communist threats. In the premiere issue's second story, the six-page \"Second Assignment: Track Down the Baby Buzz Bombs\", an unnamed, blond-haired teenager working as a page at Flagg's network assists the hero and is rewarded with own costume and the name Speedboy.\n\nThe two went on to battle an array of mostly Communists grotesqueries with physical deformities and colorful names, such as the two-headed criminal Doubleheader, the redheaded battleaxe Rhode Island Red, the Russian dwarf Sawdoff, the super-smelly Super-Khakhalovitch, the bouncing bank robber Round Robin, and Invisible Irving, the Great Nothing.\n\nThough not specified, Fighting American's powers are shown to be increased strength, agility, endurance, and speed. His aging was also slowed to the point where a fellow WWII vet notes he hasn't \"aged a day.\"\n\nIn a six-issue miniseries (February–July 1994), published by DC Comics and written by Dave Rawson and Pat McGreal, with art by Greg LaRocque, the character was a former radio host bent on avenging his brother's death.\n\nA two-issue miniseries (August–October 1997) from Awesome Entertainment, written by Rob Liefeld (story) and Jeph Loeb (script), and penciled by Liefeld and Stephen Platt, had originally been produced for the \"Heroes Reborn\" version of Captain America for Marvel Comics. Here, Fighting American was a retired superhero coping with the death of his partner. The miniseries came about, Liefeld said in 2007, while he was packaging a Captain America series for Marvel. In early 1997, the company, which had filed for bankruptcy, asked Liefeld to accept lower payment for his studio's work. He refused and was removed from the series. Liefeld called Fighting American co-creator Joe Simon and Roz Kirby, widow of co-creator Jack Kirby, who agreed to license the character to him, but at a price Liefeld would not accept. Liefeld created the similar character Agent America, drawing \"maybe three pinups and one poster image\", but withdrew the character, he said, when Simon threatened to sue. Liefeld negotiated a new deal for Fighting American, but was then sued by Marvel. During the course of the trial, he said, his version of Fighting American acquired a shield. As one of the terms of the settlement, however, Fighting American was forbidden from throwing his shield like a weapon, to distinguish him from Captain America.\n\nIn later comics published by Awesome Entertainment, Fighting American was John Flagg, a former soldier who gained powers through an unspecified experiment \"never to be duplicated.\" A subsequent miniseries, \"Rules of the Game\", written by Loeb with art by Ed McGuinness, reintroduced some of the original Simon & Kirby villains. It was followed by the miniseries \"Dogs of War\", written by Jim Starlin and penciled by Platt. While Awesome was legally prohibited from having him throw the shield, \"Rules\" and \"Dogs\" showed several additional weapons are built into it, including multiple spike projectiles, a Gatling gun and a mini-missile. This version has also used throwing stars tipped with tranquilizers.\n\nIn 2009, Dynamite Entertainment's Nick Barrucci announced his company would publish the character with creative contributions from artist Alex Ross, although character co-creator Joe Simon contended he never gave his approval, saying, \"There are some penciled covers of Fighting American by Mr. Ross that are printed in the story without copyright notice. I find that damaging, as is the whole fake story.\" Kirby-estate attorney Paul S. Levine countered that Simon's attorney, Tedd Kessler, had been informed and approving of Fighting American negotiations involving Barrucci \"from the very beginning\", including the drafting of contracts among Dynamite, the Kirby estate, and Simon, which were unsigned at the time of Barrucci's announcement. Following this disagreement between Simon and Barrucci, the Kirby estate withdrew its own participation.\n\nIn 2017 Titan Comics brought back Fighting American and Speed for a new monthly book. The first four issues written by Gordon Rennie, drawn by Duke Mighten (Issues 1–2 complete, 13 pages of Issue #3) and PC De La Fuente (Issue #4), inked by Jed Dougherty, coloured by Tracy Bailey and edited by David Leach saw Fighting American and his sidekick Speedboy arriving through a time warp in the present day New York and getting marooned in the present, whilst on the trail of a gang of his worst enemies brought through time by the mysterious Madame Chaos. This was followed up by a second four-issue mini series called The Ties That Bind, written again by Gordon Rennie and drawn by Andie Tong, with colouring by Tracy Bailey.\n\n\n"}

While playing in Denmark he won the Danish Super Liga Player of the Year, becoming the first North American player to receive the award. That same season Hutchinson won Canadian Player of the Year for the first time in his career. Between 2010 and 2013, he played for PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Eredivisie.\n\nIn 2012 as part of the Canadian Soccer Association's centennial celebration, he was named to the all-time Canada XI men's team.\n\nHutchinson was born in Brampton, Ontario, to Trinidadian parents. Following a March 2001 trial at Schalke 04 in Germany, Hutchinson began his professional career in the 2002 summer season, playing briefly with the York Region Shooters of the Canadian Professional Football League before signing with the Toronto Lynx of the then A-League in mid-season, on 26 July, and playing in the team's final four games.\n\nIn January 2003 he signed with Östers IF, newly promoted to the Swedish Allsvenskan. Hutchinson scored six times for Öster during the 2003 season. With the club relegated out of the Allsvenskan, Hutchinson was granted a transfer for an estimated £1.32 million and signed with Helsingborgs IF in January 2004.\n\nExpectations were high for him the first season in Helsingborg, but they were ultimately unsatisfied. However, in the 2005 season he was consistently the team's best player, scoring six goals from a primarily defensive midfield position.\n\nHutchinson moved to Danish club F.C. Copenhagen, where, for the first half of the year, he played alongside Swedish international Tobias Linderoth in central midfield, latterly being used around the midfield and as a striker. Manager Ståle Solbakken said in an interview with the football paper \"TIPS-bladet\", that he saw Hutchinson's attacking talents as being too impressive for a central midfielder, saying that he would be used more often as winger.\nHe has been linked with Premier League clubs several times.\n\nAfter Hutchinson had left Denmark for his new team in the Eredivisie he was awarded Danish Super Liga Player of the Year for his last season with Copenhagen. This award was given on 15 November 2010 by Franz Beckenbauer at the annual Danish Football Association award show. This was the first time a Canadian had won this award in the Danish League.\n\nIn 2014, 32,000 fans participated in a fan vote selecting their 11 all-time favourite Copenhagen players, selecting Hutchinson in the midfield.\n\nOn 22 April 2010, Hutchinson signed a 3-year contract with PSV Eindhoven joining them on a free transfer. Atiba made his PSV debut in a 6-0 home victory against De Graafschap on 14 August 2010. Four days later he made his European debut for the team in a surprising 1-0 first leg defeat to FC Sibir Novosibirsk in the Europa League, however PSV won the second leg 5-0 making it to the next stage of the competition. Atiba scored his first goal with the Dutch side on 23 January 2011, his goal came in the 46th minute of a 3-0 away victory against VVV-Venlo. Hutchinson started the 2010 season playing a defensive role as a right back, however with the mid-season transfer of Ibrahim Afellay to Barcelona allowed Hutchinson to move into his more natural position of the central midfield. Atiba continued to impress through the winter scoring his second goal of the season in a 3-2 away victory against Excelsior on 5 March 2011. Atiba also help lead PSV to the Quarter Finals of the Europa League before being knocked out by Benfica in mid-April losing 6-3 on aggregate.\n\nHutchinson was forced to miss the beginning of the 2011–12 Eredivisie due to his knee injury sustained with Canada at the Gold Cup that summer. After missing the first two games of the season Hutchinson made his return on 21 August 2011 as a second-half substitute for Zakaria Labyad against ADO Den Haag, the game ended in a 3-0 away victory for PSV. Weeks later Hutchinson sustained yet another knee injury during a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification against Saint Lucia forcing him to have his third knee operation in 18 months. Despite this, he would start the KNVB Cup final for PSV against Heracles Almelo, which PSV would win.\n\nWith PSV's summer addition of Mark van Bommel Hutchinson was moved back to defense playing right back. On 26 August 2012 Atiba scored his first goal of the new season courtesy of a Dries Mertens through ball in the 38th minute, the game ended in a 3-1 away victory over FC Groningen.\n\nWith a desire to sign for a Premier League team Hutchinson let his contract run out with PSV and went into the summer of 2013 looking for a new team, but on 30 July it was announced that he had joined Beşiktaş J.K. in the Süper Lig. Hutchinson scored his first goal for the club on 23 March 2014 in a 3–0 victory over Akhisar Belediyespor. After missing the first leg in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League play-off round Hutchinson had a standout performance against Arsenal in which Arsène Wenger said Hutchinson was the most impressive Besiktas player; the game ended in a 1–0 away defeat for the Turkish side. In the 2015–16 Süper Lig season, Hutchinson was rewarded with another hard fought honour as Beşiktaş J.K. triumphed in the league campaign, which was successfully repeated in the 2016–17 Süper Lig season, again with Atiba in a key playmaking defensive midfielder role.\n\nHutchinson played at the 2001 and 2003 FIFA World Youth Championships.\n\nHe made his senior debut for Canada in a January 2003 friendly match against the United States and, by December 2009, has earned a total of 47 caps, scoring 3 goals. He has represented Canada in 12 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and at the 2003, 2005, 2007 & 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cups.\n17 December 2010 Atiba was awarded the Canadian Men's Player of the Year by the CSA for the first time of his career. Hutchinson was heavily favoured for this award in 2010 for his play with the national team, joining a well known European club and becoming the first Canadian to win the Danish Superliga Player of the year. Atiba won with 31.4% of the vote with Dwayne De Rosario in second place.\n\nHutchinson was selected to the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad. However following the 2-0 loss to the Americans at Ford Field Hutchinson sustained a knee injury forcing him to miss the rest of the tournament. On 12 December 2012 Hutchinson was again awarded the Canadian Player of the year from the CSA for the second time in his career. Hutchinson was once again awarded the 2015 Canadian Men's Player of the Year by the CFA marking his 4th straight award and 5th in the last 6 years. He also won this title 2016 and 2017.\n\nHutchinson continued to feature under Canada coach John Herdman and upon his recall to the team in October 2018, Hutchinson indicated he was looking to retire from the Canadian national team after the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

{"id": "1800240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800240", "title": "Military history of the Netherlands during World War II", "text": "Military history of the Netherlands during World War II\n\nThe Netherlands entered World War II on May 10, 1940, when invading German forces quickly overran them. On December 7, 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Netherlands government in exile also declared war on Japan. Operation Market Garden, which started in 1944, liberated the southern and eastern parts of the country, but full liberation did not come until the surrender of Germany on May 5, 1945.\n\nWhen World War II erupted in September 1939, most in the Netherlands believed that the country could remain neutral, as it had in World War I. The months of \"Phoney War\" following the German invasion of Poland seemed to justify this attitude. The Dutch army did immediately mobilize in 1939, but not in full strength until April 1940.\n\nSigns to the contrary went unheeded. Among them were some incidents, most notably the Venlo incident in which members of the German Abwehr operating in the Netherlands abducted two members of the British SIS and killed one Dutch intelligence officer. More direct were worrying signals from Berlin received by the government beginning in the first months of 1940. The Dutch military attaché there, Major Bert Sas, had established good relations with Colonel Hans Oster, who occupied a high position in the Abwehr. Oster warned Sas about German plans for an offensive against the Netherlands, Belgium and France, and Sas passed the warnings on. The government in the Netherlands, however, did not take them seriously, as the offensive was postponed several times, even though Oster did eventually offer the correct date of May 10, 1940.\n\nThe Dutch army was not considered formidable even at the end of World War I, and it did not prosper during the interwar years. By the time of the German invasion in 1940, a total of 20 battalions were operational for the defense of the Netherlands, most poorly prepared for combat. Only a few had modern weapons; the majority of soldiers carried carbines of 19th-century vintage, and most artillery was similarly outdated. The Dutch army also had little armor, and its air arm, the Luchtvaartafdeeling, had but a handful of reasonably modern aircraft, most notably the Fokker G.1 twin-engine fighter-bomber and the fixed-undercarriage Fokker D.XXI single-seat fighter, with which to face the Luftwaffe.\n\nReasons cited for the weakness of the Netherlands military include decay during the long lapse of time since its last active participation in a war, the Aceh War 1873-1903; the effects of widespread pacifism during the 1920s and 1930s; budget cuts, particularly during the Great Depression; and undue belief by politicians that the League of Nations would offer sufficient protection from aggression. Certainly, the Dutch military faced an unfavorable political climate between the wars. For example, in 1925, when rebuilding the Dutch army into a modern fighting force would have required increased funding of 350 million gulden, the government instead cut the army's budget by 100 million gulden. A committee tasked with finding further cuts concluded that the army was already so weak that any reductions would endanger its sustainability; the government thereupon disbanded the committee and appointed a new, more aggressive one, which recommended cutting another 160 million. Meanwhile, potential human capital was allowed to dissipate; compulsory service was cut back from 24 months to six, barely enough for the most basic of training.\n\nNot until 1936 did the Dutch government recognize the growing threat of Nazi Germany, but the resultant budget increases were too small and too late to establish an effective defense of the country. One factor was practical: by that time, many European countries were rearming and had already placed orders taxing the available capacity of munitions plants, hindering Dutch efforts at procurement. A second factor was continued economic pressure, as Defense Minister Adriaan Dijxhoorn refused to authorize funds for modernizing both main Dutch lines of defense against attack from the east, the Waterline and the Grebbe line. The failure of General Izaak H. Reijnders, leader of the Dutch General Staff, to obtain more funding for these lines led to his replacement on February 6, 1940 by General Henri Winkelman, who opted to concentrate on modernizing the Grebbeline, with its largely wooden bunkers, because German artillery brought up as deep within the country as the Waterline would be within range of Amsterdam. Modernization of the Grebbeline, however, would not be complete or effective by the time of the invasion, in part because the government balked at the expense of clearing forests and houses blocking lines of sight from many of the fortifications.\n\nFor Germany, the Netherlands was only of secondary importance in the attack on France. Germany's main worry was the route through Limburg, to eliminate the delay caused by the Liege corridor, that had hindered German forces during World War I.\n\nThe aim of the attack plan was to eliminate the country as soon as possible. The 18th Army and the 9th Panzer Division were allotted for this task.\n\nThe 18th Army was to attack the Netherlands above the Rhine, most notably breaking through the eastern defences of Fortress Holland (formed by the Grebbeline) and crossing the Afsluitdijk. The 9th Panzer Division was to move through the southern part of the Netherlands and attack the Moerdijk Bridge.\n\nFurthermore, the 22nd Air Landing Division and the 7th Fliegerdivision were to land around The Hague, in order to capture Queen Wilhelmina, the Dutch government and the General Staff. They also were to capture the Moerdijk Bridge and the bridges over the Maas in Rotterdam so that the 9th Panzer Division could easily cross these.\n\nIn preparation for their attack, German officers had conducted extensive espionage research. The Dutch did not hinder them in this - indeed, a watchtower near the Grebbe Line was not closed because, as Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer said, \"it would harm the Dutch economy.\" Although after mobilization the lines would be closed to the public, a lot of high-ranking officers from the German army, including a few colonels, were able to see the Dutch lines and write down where the bunkers were, so artillery could destroy them.\n\nBased on these observations, the Germans thought they could capture the Netherlands in one to two days.\n\nIn the first days of May 1940, the Dutch government received several indications of German activity near the border, and on May 7 all leave was cancelled and the army was put on alert. Finally, on May 10, 3:55, the German army invaded the Netherlands.\n\nThe rivers IJssel and Maas, running through the Netherlands from south to north and from east to west, were the first obstacles that the Germans encountered. They had created special units to capture the bridges over these rivers (sometimes even clad in Dutch uniforms), but in all but a few places the Dutch defenders were able to demolish the bridges. The German advance was further hindered by a line of pillboxes along both rivers, but despite heavy resistance they succeeded in crossing both IJssel and Maas by midday.\n\nIn the meantime, the airborne forces had taken the Dutch by surprise. German paratroopers succeeded in taking the Moerdijk bridges, the traffic bridge near Dordrecht and partially the traffic bridge in Rotterdam. They also captured the airfields of Waalhaven (near Rotterdam), and Ypenburg, Ockenburg and Valkenburg (around The Hague). However, Dutch resistance was again heavier than expected and the Dutch succeeded in keeping the paratroopers out of The Hague itself. Indeed, by the evening, all three airfields around The Hague had been recaptured by the Dutch.\nThe next day, the attack on the Grebbe Line started. The Germans attacked its most southern point, the Grebbeberg, where there were no inundations. Instead, there was a front line of outposts, a main defense line and finally a stop line, from which possible breaches in the main line could be contained and repaired. After an artillery barrage, the SS regiment \"Der Führer\" attacked the outposts. Once again, despite stiff resistance, the Germans succeeded in capturing the northern part of the outpost line, after which they could easily outflank the southern part. However, it took them until 16:00 to capture all outposts.\n\nBy now, French reinforcements had started to arrive from the south. Because of miscommunications between the Dutch and the French, and also because the Moerdijk Bridge, the only link between the eastern and southern parts of the Netherlands, was still in German hands, their effectiveness was limited.\n\nOn May 12, the German 1st Cavalry Division tried to cross the Afsluitdijk. However, at Kornwerderzand, the Dutch had built modern concrete fortifications to protect the dam. Moreover, the dam offered no cover whatsoever and the attack was easily repulsed (with the help of a Dutch gunboat). The Germans would try again on May 13, but with no success. The Kornwerderzand fortification would hold out until the Dutch surrender.\n\nOn the same day, the Germans attacked the main defense line of the Grebbe Line. Sometimes using Dutch POWs as a shield (a grave violation of the laws of war), by the end of the day they had captured this line as well. The Dutch tried to organize a counter-attack during the night, as they thought there were only some hundred German troops opposing them (the real number was probably somewhere around two thousand), but this met with little success. In places, they were even fired upon by other Dutch troops who had not been notified of the counter-attack.\n\nFinally, on May 13, the 9th Panzer Division brushed aside the French and joined up with the paratroopers. However, they met with heavy resistance in Rotterdam, where their advance was stopped.\n\nOn the same day, the Germans mounted their final attack against the Grebbe Line. The stop line, the last resort of the Dutch defenders, collapsed and the Germans broke through. Isolated pockets of Dutch troops continued to resist, but a night attack to dislodge the Germans failed. As there were no reserve troops, it was clear that defeat was imminent: there was nothing between the Germans and the North Sea but the famous \"Waterlinie\" (Water Line) was only very sketchily prepared.\n\nOn May 14, the Dutch commander at Rotterdam, Colonel Scharroo, received an ultimatum: if he did not surrender, the town would be bombed. As the ultimatum was not signed, Scharroo sent it back. A few hours later, he received another ultimatum, this time duly signed by General Schmidt, the German commander at Rotterdam. Schmidt did not know that a squadron of bombers was already on its way to bomb Rotterdam. The Germans tried to warn the bomber crews by shooting red flares, but only half of the squadron noticed this; the other half continued on their mission and dropped their bombs on the city (see the Rotterdam Blitz).\n\nUnder the threat that other major cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht would share the fate of Rotterdam in which over 900 civilians were killed, the Dutch decided to surrender. On May 15, in Rijsoord, General Winkelman signed the surrender of the Netherlands, with the exception of the province of Zeeland, where the French still operated (Zeeland held out until May 19, after the city of Middelburg was bombed). The Dutch colonies also continued the battle.\n\nCasualties were high in the five day campaign- over 10,000 Dutch soldiers were killed, injured or declared missing.\n\nThough the Netherlands was occupied, by no means was all lost. The colonies (most notably the Dutch East Indies) were still free, and Queen Wilhelmina and the Dutch government had left the Netherlands for London.\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Navy had managed to get most of its ships to England (one, the light cruiser \"Jacob van Heemskerk\" was not finished yet and had to be towed). Also, the Netherlands had a large merchant marine, which would contribute greatly to the Allied war effort during the rest of the war.\n\nA few Dutch pilots also had escaped and joined the RAF to fight in the Battle of Britain. In July 1940, two all-Dutch squadrons were formed with personnel and Fokker seaplanes from the Dutch naval air force: 320 Squadron and 321 Squadron (which afterwards moved to Ceylon). The Royal Netherlands Military Flying School was re-established at Hawkins Field, Jackson, Mississippi. In 1943, an all-Dutch fighter squadron was formed in the UK, 322 Squadron.\n\nIn 1942, an all-Dutch brigade was formed, the Princess Irene Brigade. This brigade would go on to participate in Operation Overlord in 1944.\n\nInside the Netherlands, both passive and active resistance was widespread throughout the country, with the first Dutch Resistance organisation, the Communist Party of the Netherlands, holding their first meeting the day after the Dutch capitulation.\n\nThe Allied Special Forces also recruited and trained a number of Dutch officers for Operation Jedburgh teams and for the Anglo Dutch Country Section of Force 136.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dutch government declared war on Japan. Like the defense of its mother country, the defense of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) had been hopelessly neglected; the strongest naval units available were three light cruisers (\"De Ruyter\", \"Java\" and \"Tromp\"), there were so few planes that Martin 139/166 bombers had to be used as fighters, and the KNIL, the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, was poorly equipped (though better than the Dutch army had been in 1940).\n\nThe Dutch participated in the ABDACOM, a joint-command for all American, British, Dutch and Australian units in the area to defend Southeast Asia against the Japanese advance. Nevertheless, despite these efforts, in the three months following Pearl Harbor the Dutch East Indies (along with the rest of Southeast Asia) were overrun by the Japanese. After the Battle of the Java Sea, naval assets were gone and the Dutch East Indies surrendered on March 8, 1942.\n\nHowever, some personnel, especially aviators, managed to reach Australia. Later, three joint Australian-NEI squadrons were formed. The first of these, No. 18 (NEI) Squadron RAAF, was formed in April 1942 as a medium bomber squadron equipped with B-25 Mitchell aircraft. The second joint Australian-NEI squadron, No. 119 (NEI) Squadron RAAF, was also to be a medium bomber squadron. No. 119 NEI Squadron was only active between September and December 1943 when it was disbanded to form No. 120 (NEI) Squadron RAAF which was a fighter squadron, equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks. Both No. 18 and No. 120 Squadrons saw action against the Japanese (and against Indonesian nationalists during the Indonesian National Revolution, before being disbanded in 1950).\n\nSome Dutch ships were also based in Australia and Ceylon, and continued to operate in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Due to the high number of submarines present in the Netherlands East Indies (the major part of the defensive plans of the Dutch government), the Dutch were called, in the Asian Campaign, the Fourth Ally. The total number of submarines operating in the Eastern Theater was seventeen.\n\nDuring the Borneo campaign of 1945, some Dutch army units — including some from the Dutch West Indies and Dutch Guyana — were attached to Australian Army units operating in the Dutch portion of Borneo.\n\nThe Netherlands’ colonial possessions in the Caribbean comprised the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten, and these together with Surinam, made up the Netherlands West Indies.\n\nAruba was of significant strategic importance as it housed the largest oil terminal in the Caribbean, from which much of Britain’s oil was shipped. Oil from Venezuela was taken by coastal tankers to Aruba where it was stored in large tanks awaiting transshipment to oceangoing vessels. These facilities were vulnerable to German attack but as the UK could spare no resources to help protect them, their defense fell to the Netherlands West Indies Defense Force. This Territorial force possessed only small arms, a handful of obsolete 8 cm. naval guns and a few small coastal patrol boats. In the summer of 1940 it was felt that the U-boat threat to the oil terminal and shipping lanes necessitated air cover and so an air support unit was created using a Fokker F.XVIII converted for maritime patrol duties.\n\nIn fact, the only military action in the area occurred in February 1942 when the Defense Force’s Fokker together with a US aircraft attacked two U-boats off Aruba which had sunk a number of allied oilers. From the summer of 1942 onwards, air cover for the area was provided by US aircraft.\n\nThe first Allied troops entered the Netherlands on September 9, 1944, on a reconnaissance patrol; on September 12, 1944, a small part of Limburg was liberated by the US 30th Infantry Division. During Operation Market Garden, the Americans and British established a corridor to Nijmegen, but they failed to secure a Rhine crossing at Arnhem.\n\nDuring the rest of 1944, the Canadian First Army liberated Zeeland in the Schelde Campaign, in order to free access to the harbour of Antwerp. By 1945, the entire southern part of the Netherlands (up to the Waal and Maas rivers) had been liberated.\n\nAfter Operation Veritable, the Allied advance from the Dutch-German border into the Rhineland, and the crossing of the Rhine at Wesel and Rees in Operation Plunder, the Canadian First Army liberated the eastern and northern parts of the Netherlands. However, they did not attack the German forces in the western part (ironically, they stopped at about where the Grebbe Line was in 1940), for fear of massive civilian casualties: the western part of the Netherlands (also called the Randstad) is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. The civilian population there, still suffering from the effects of the \"Hongerwinter\" ('Hungerwinter'), was now cut off from food that was available in the rest of the Netherlands. However, the Germans, having agreed to a truce, did allow the staging of an Allied relief effort, Operations Manna (RAF) and Chowhound (USAAF). The German forces in the Netherlands finally surrendered in Wageningen, on May 5, 1945. The acts of Canadian soldiers toward the civilian population during this period would be a major point of endearment and friendship in Canada–Netherlands relations, among other acts throughout the war, for many years afterward.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800265", "title": "Emergy", "text": "Emergy\n\nEmergy is the amount of energy that was consumed in direct and indirect transformations to make a product or service. Emergy is a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of \"emjoule\"s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.\n\nThe theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in thermodynamics, general system theory and systems ecology. Evolution of the theory by Howard T. Odum over the first thirty years is reviewed in \"Environmental Accounting\" and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled \"Maximum Power\".\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed energy flow in ecosystems (\"e.g.\" Silver Springs, Florida; Enewetak atoll in the south Pacific; Galveston Bay, Texas and Puerto Rican rainforests, amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the potential energy of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and ocean currents led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of \"energy of one kind\" as a common denominator with the name \"energy cost\". He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s, and in the 1970s to fossil fuels.\n\nOdum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:\nEnergy is measured by calories, btu's, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures. The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human information processing.\n\nIn 1975, he introduced a table of \"Energy Quality Factors\", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy, the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that \"energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations\" from one type of energy to the next.\n\nThese energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called \"Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents\" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. \"Energy quality ratios\" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).\n\nThe term \"embodied energy\" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a \"quality factor\" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another. However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of \"embodied solar calories\", and the quality factors became known as \"transformation ratios\".\n\nUse of the term \"embodied energy\" for this concept was modified in 1986 when David Scienceman, a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term \"emergy\" and \"emjoule\" or \"emcalorie\" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy. The term transformation ratio was shortened to transformity in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.\n\nAfter 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research and a biennial International Conference at the University of Florida support this research.\n\nEmergy— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the emjoule or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.\n\nUnit Emergy Values (UEVs) — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:\n\nEmergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.\n\nIn some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.\n\nSystem diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.\n\nA table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.\n\nAll tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.\n\nThe table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.\n\nFigure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.\n\nOther ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.\n\nThe recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of complex systems has resulted in increased emphasis on environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.\n\nThe concept of emergy has been controversial within academe including ecology, thermodynamics and economy. Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other theories of value. The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an \"ecocentric\" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.\n\nThe idea that a calorie of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the 1st Law definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's mechanical equivalent of heat). Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.\n\n"}

The airline's base was Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Ikeja, its head office was in Lagos Island, Lagos and the C&M building in Crawley, and its registered office was in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nThe airline, which effectively replaced the defunct Nigeria Airways, was founded in 2004 as a joint venture between Nigerian investors and the Virgin Group. Virgin withdrew from the business between 2008 and 2010. Following two name changes, Air Nigeria announced on 6 September 2012 that it had made its staff redundant and ceased operations on 10 September 2012.\n\nOn 28 September 2004, the Nigerian government and Virgin Group signed an agreement to establish a new airline for Nigeria, to be called Virgin Nigeria Airways. Nigerian institutional investors owned 51% of the company and Virgin Atlantic Airways the remaining 49%. The airline's inaugural flight was on 28 June 2005 from Lagos to London Heathrow, using an Airbus A340-300 aircraft. Virgin Nigeria quickly became one of Nigeria's largest airlines, carrying its 1,000,000th passenger and 4,000th ton of freight within two years of operation. The airline also received accolades including THISDAY Awards 2006 Airline of the year and a nomination for 2006 African Airline of the year by ASATA (Association of South African Travel Agents). Virgin Nigeria had plans to make Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja its second base, where, in addition to its Lagos base Murtala Muhammed International Airport, it would serve all countries in West Africa. \n\nThe Nigerian government set a deadline of 30 April 2007 for all airlines operating in the country to re-capitalise or be grounded, in an effort to ensure better services and safety. The airline satisfied the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA)’s criteria in terms of re-capitalization and was re-registered for operation.\n\nOn 19 August 2008, Virgin Atlantic announced that it was \"in talks to sell its 49 percent stake in Virgin Nigeria\" and reviewing \"whether it is appropriate that the Virgin brand should remain linked to Virgin Nigeria”. This followed a dispute which arose after Virgin Nigeria's domestic operations were moved against its will by the Ministry of Transportation to Terminal 2. Virgin Nigeria had twice refused the directive to relocate its domestic operations from the international terminal, citing the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding it had signed with the previous (Olusegun Obasanjo) administration, and pending appeal in a Lagos High court, as reasons for not complying.\n\nOn 9 January 2009, Virgin Nigeria announced it would suspend all long haul flights to London Gatwick Airport and Johannesburg, effective 27 January 2009.\n\nOn 17 September 2009, Virgin Nigeria announced on its website it had rebranded as Nigerian Eagle Airlines.

{"id": "1800277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800277", "title": "Resident Evil – Code: Veronica", "text": "Resident Evil – Code: Veronica\n\nResident Evil – Code: Veronica is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom and released for the Dreamcast in 2000. It is the fourth major installment in the \"Resident Evil\" series and the first to debut on a separate platform from the PlayStation. The story takes place three months after the events of \"Resident Evil 2\" (1998) and the concurrent destruction of Raccoon City as seen in \"\" (1999). It follows Claire Redfield and her brother Chris Redfield in their efforts to survive a viral outbreak at both a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. The game retains the traditional survival horror controls and gameplay seen in previous series installments; however, unlike the pre-rendered backgrounds of previous games, \"Code: Veronica\" utilizes real-time 3D environments and dynamic camera movement.\n\nThe roots of \"Code: Veronica\"s development can be traced back to an unsuccessful attempt to port \"Resident Evil 2\" to the Sega Saturn. After producer Shinji Mikami and his team learned they would be unable to port the game, they began development on an original game which eventually became \"Code: Veronica\". Although planned as a spin-off, the game was intentionally designed as the true sequel to \"Resident Evil 2\" according to its creators. The title of \"\"Resident Evil 3\"\" was given to what was originally another spin-off game being developed in tandem for the PlayStation. Claire was designed with a tougher appearance than in \"Resident Evil 2\", with the reason being her past experiences in Raccoon City built her toughness and confidence. Unlike the American horror themes and settings of previous games in the series, \"Code: Veronica\" employs a setting in the Southern Ocean and a European gothic horror design. This is achieved through the use of gothic architecture and art in addition to the writing style and story presentation.\n\nCapcom announced \"Code: Veronica\" in August 1998 and released it in February 2000 after delays and a reduction in sales expectations due to the struggling Dreamcast platform. Sales were weak compared to series predecessors, but strong compared to other games on the system. The title received critical acclaim and has been considered both among the best \"Resident Evil\" games and Dreamcast games of all-time. Capcom released an updated version on PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast titled \"Code: Veronica X\". The revised version included new cutscenes which revealed more details about the story, and it was later ported to the GameCube in addition to other platforms in later years. In September 2011 Capcom released a high-definition remastered version of \"Code: Veronica X\" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\"Code: Veronica\" was adapted for Capcom's \"Gun Survivor\" series with \"\" (2002) and also later adapted for \"\" (2009).\n\n\"Resident Evil – Code: Veronica\" features survival horror gameplay, similar to previous \"Resident Evil\" games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, \"Code: Veronica\" uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, the camera is more dynamic than in previous games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates their character through the environment, similar to Capcom's own \"Dino Crisis\" (1999). The story is told through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.\n\nOne half of \"Code: Veronica\" places the player in control of Claire Redfield while the other half is spent with her brother, Chris. Basic character actions include running, attacking, as well as pushing and climbing objects. Items the player collects can be viewed on the status screen. From here, they can be examined to find clues to solve puzzles, and some can also be equipped. Also available in the status screen is a map and file menu. All notes found in the game are saved in game's files and may be essential to solve puzzles. The player can only hold a limited number of items at a given time; other items must be stored in storage boxes located throughout the game.\n\nThe player character may receive damage, which can be healed with restore items. Herbs, which restore character health, can be combined with other types of herbs to become more effective. Too much damage will result in a game over. At this point, the game must be continued from the last save point. A partner's death will also result in a game over. Some weapons are better suited for battling certain enemies, some of which have weaknesses to elements like fire or acid. Once the game is beaten once, \"Battle Mode\" is unlocked. This mode gives the player character infinite ammo and places them in random locations with different enemies.\n\nIn December 1998, three months after escaping from Raccoon City (seen in \"Resident Evil 2)\" and prior to its eventual destruction (seen in \"\"), Claire Redfield raids an Umbrella Corporation facility in Paris, in search of her brother Chris Redfield. Discovered by Umbrella's security forces and eventually captured, Claire is imprisoned on Rockfort Island—a prison complex owned by the corporation, situated in the Southern Ocean. Sometime after her imprisonment, Claire finds herself released by one of the prison staff, and discovers that an outbreak of the T-Virus has occurred. In the resulting chaos, she finds herself teaming up with Steve Burnside, another inmate seeking to escape.\n\nIn their efforts to explore the island and find the means to leave, the pair finds themselves confronting the island's commander, Alfred Ashford. Both Claire and Steve find him to be mentally unstable as a result of him switching between two personalities—his own, and that of his twin sister Alexia. Eventually, the pair manages to find a seaplane and use it to escape, only for Alfred to pursue them and switch their plane to autopilot, directing it towards another Umbrella facility in Antarctica. Upon their arrival, the pair finds that the facility had suffered an outbreak, and fight their way through the zombies and monsters within to seek a means of escape, battling with Alfred and fatally wounding him. Before he dies, Alfred frees his sister Alexia, who had been in cryogenic sleep within the facility after injecting herself with the T-Veronica virus—an experimental virus that the Ashford family had developed 15 years ago. Awakened, Alexia manages to recapture Claire and Steve as they attempt to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Redfield arrives on Rockfort Island in search of Claire, after receiving a message from her via Leon S. Kennedy. Upon learning that she had left, Chris focuses on determining where and begins searching the island. In the process of doing so, he comes across Albert Wesker, an independent agent since the Spencer mansion incident (the events of \"Resident Evil\"), who is seeking to retrieve a sample of the T-Veronica virus. After Chris learns of his sister's whereabouts, and Wesker discovers that Alexia is alive and carries what he needs, the two separately find their way to Antarctica. Once there, Chris frees his sister and helps her to search for Steve, only for them to find that he had been experimented with and injected with the T-Veronica virus. After mutating, Steve attempts to kill Claire but fails, regaining control of himself to turn on Alexia, who then inflicts a mortal wound on him. Before Steve dies, he confesses his love for Claire. Meanwhile, Chris and Wesker confront Alexia. In the resulting conflict, Wesker escapes and manages to retrieve Steve's corpse for further experimentation, while Chris manages to defeat Alexia and escape with his sister, before the Antarctic facility self-destructs.\n\nWith the success of \"Resident Evil 2\" in 1998, Capcom began more \"Resident Evil\" projects across multiple consoles. \"Code: Veronica\" originated from an unsuccessful attempt to port \"Resident Evil 2\" to the Sega Saturn. After producer Shinji Mikami and his team learned they would be unable to port the game without making a large sacrifice to quality, Mikami was asked by his leadership to create something else for Sega fans, and so development began on an original game. When Mikami asked for more time to develop the game, he was told it would need to have a better technical quality, making Sega's upcoming Dreamcast more appealing. Around the same time, a side-story game for the PlayStation starring Jill Valentine in the events leading up to \"Resident Evil 2\" was being developed. This title was originally intended to be a spin-off with the Dreamcast title to be the true sequel. According to IGN, Sony bartered for limited exclusivity on the \"Resident Evil 3\" title, and thus the side-story was branded as \"\" and the true sequel was labeled a spin-off and later titled \"Code: Veronica\". This notion is conflicted by interviews at the time, as producer Shinji Mikami and Flagship president Yoshiki Okamoto told journalists they wanted to keep the numbered chronology on the PlayStation systems, and give subtitles to \"Resident Evil\" games on all other systems. Regardless, the game content remained essentially unchanged.\n\n\"Code: Veronica\"s story, setting, and artistic design strayed away from the series standard. While previous games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, \"Code: Veronica\" is set in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made clear in the environments which feature gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in \"Code: Veronica\" is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of storytelling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.\n\nDuring in-game cutscenes, the polygon count is increased to nearly 2,500 polygons, especially on character faces. Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire was given a tougher appearance in \"Code: Veronica\" than in \"Resident Evil 2\", the reason being her experiences in \"Resident Evil 2\" built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described \"Code: Veronica\" as 50-60% of his perfect vision for \"Resident Evil\" in February 2001, and he cited that future \"Resident Evil\" projects may make up the other half.\n\nBy the time \"Resident Evil 3\" was released, development on \"Code: Veronica\" was nearing completion. Much of \"Code: Veronica\"s 70-person development staff was outsourced because Capcom resources had been tied up working on \"Resident Evil 3\". Shinji Mikami and Yoshiki Okamoto's team at Flagship oversaw the game's scenario and direction, while XAX Entertainment assisted with environments and Nextech handled much of the technical development. Capcom Production Studio 4 still handled art direction and character design. By September 1999, Sega was sending some of its own developers to help add final touches to the game. Sega assisted Capcom with the game's programming to help keep a good framerate.\n\n\"Code: Veronica\" was confirmed to be in development as early as August 1998. Despite not being a numbered title, they still promoted it as the true sequel to \"Resident Evil 2\". It was officially revealed on October 6, 1998 by Capcom R&D chief Yoshiki Okamoto. Capcom of Japan stated that they were hoping to sell the game to roughly one third of all Dreamcast users, which they estimated would total to around one million copies. In July 1999, Capcom of Japan announced their shipment expectations for the Japanese Dreamcast version were at 400,000 copies. Journalists were skeptical if this was only the initial shipment, or evidence that Capcom overestimated sales of the Dreamcast, given their initial sales estimate was one million. Capcom initially planned to have \"Code: Veronica\" released around the same time as \"Resident Evil 3\" and, more importantly, the Dreamcast launch in North America in September 9, 1999. However, delays pushed the project back to early 2000. To make up for the game's absence, Capcom announced they would release a port of \"Resident Evil 2\" for the Dreamcast that December. This release, called \"Biohazard 2: Value Plus\", included a demo for \"Code: Veronica\".\n\"Code: Veronica\" was released in February 2000. Pre-ordered copies came with a unique numbered tag, special red packaging, and a unique title screen. Limited Dreamcast system bundles were also released to commemorate the game's release. The \"Claire Version\", limited to 1,800 copies, consisted of the \"Code: Veronica\" game, a pink system, pink controller, and a VMU. The other bundle, known as the \"S.T.A.R.S. Version\", has the items except the system is a dark transparent blue and features a \"S.T.A.R.S.\" logo. This bundle was limited to 200 copies. Expecting high demand, Capcom set up a contest for fans to enter to win an opportunity to purchase the systems. A soundtrack was released in February 2000 as well.\n\nBecause the Dreamcast had a much smaller user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom knew the series could not survive on the platform. This led to bringing an extended cut, titled \"Code: Veronica X\" in the West and \"Code: Veronica Kanzenban\" in Japan, to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 in 2001. The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements. Capcom printed special DVDs of Wesker's Report for the North American PlayStation 2 release. They were sold on Capcom's website and given to customers who purchased the game at specialty retailers such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.\n\n\"Code: Veronica X\" was later released on the GameCube along with several other \"Resident Evil\" games. It was included with the Biohazard Collector Box for the GameCube in Japan, a bundle of \"Resident Evil\" titles which also included a copy of Wesker's Report. A high-definition remastered version of \"Code: Veronica X\" was released in September 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. An emulated version for the PlayStation 3 was released as a PS2 Classic in July 2012 in Japan and in May 2014 in Europe. Another emulated PS2 version was released for the PlayStation 4 in May 2017. The Xbox 360 version was added to the Xbox One backwards compatible library in February 2019.\n\n\"Code: Veronica\" released to critical acclaim; many critics believed it to be the best entry in the \"Resident Evil\" series at the time, and a \"must-own\" for the Dreamcast. Derek Williams of AllGame called it the best game for the system along with \"Soul Calibur\" (1999). A critic from Game Revolution found it to be the best of all the horror games on the Dreamcast, towering the likes of \"The House of the Dead 2\" (1999)\",\" \"Zombie Revenge\" (1999), and \"Carrier\" (2000). \"Next Generation\" dubbed it \"the best game yet for Dreamcast - in fact, one of the best games we've seen in the past couple of years.\"\n\nThe game's atmosphere and presentation received high praise. Critics at \"Edge\" called it \"the closest the series has got to emulating a Hollywood action feature\". Most reviewers found the graphics as being some of the very best on the Dreamcast and being a testament to the power of its hardware. Along with this, critics pointed out \"Code: Veronica\"'s use of real-time backgrounds and a dynamic camera as an improvement from the pre-rendered backgrounds of previous series entries. The CGI sequences were also praised, especially the opening cinematic. The use of music and sound was called \"top-notch\" and \"perfect\". The story received positive reviews. Maura Sutton of \"Computer and Video Games\" praised the adult twist on the narrative. Some critics pointed out that despite improvements, the game is still a \"Resident Evil\" title at heart, and therefore inherited the good and bad qualities of previous games. The controls were a negative point of criticism between some reviews.\n\nReviews for the PlayStation 2 release of \"Code: Veronica X\" were mostly positive. Critics shared similar opinions to the Dreamcast reviews, but some complaints were drawn from it being a mostly unmodified port of an 18-month-old Dreamcast game. GameSpot's Joe Fielder pointed out that Sony's \"Extermination\" (2001) and Capcom's own \"\" (2001) had been released during this gap with better controls. The GameCube version garnered average reviews, due to its unaltered, ported status. The high definition remaster was released over a decade after the original and was welcomed with mediocre reviews. Critics commonly cited the game's archaic design and controls as making it less appealing compared with contemporary offerings. The remaster did find some positive reception from \"Game Informer\"s Tim Turi who found in enjoyment from playing what he called a \"challenging classic survival horror game\" and \"a harrowing but memorable trek through the series' heyday.\"\n\n\"Code: Veronica\" outsold \"Shenmue\" (1999) within its first week on shelves in February 2000. In total, the Dreamcast version sold almost 450,000 units in the United States and 1.14 million copies worldwide. The sales were weak compared to series predecessors, but strong compared to other Dreamcast games. The PlayStation 2 version of \"Code: Veronica X\" had sold 900,000 copies and earned $27 million in the United States by July 2006, outselling \"Resident Evil 4\". It went on to sell 1.4 million copies worldwide. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 63rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of \"Resident Evil\" franchise released in the 2000s reached 3 million units in the United States by July 2006.\n\n\"Game Informer\" ranked \"Code: Veronica\" as 69th in their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" in 2001. GamesRadar named it the 14th best Dreamcast game of all time.\n\nThe story in \"Code: Veronica\" has been adapted into other works. \"\" (2001) for Naomi-based arcades and PlayStation 2 follows the story of \"Code: Veronica\" from a first-person view with light gun shooter style gameplay. Similarly, another light gun game, \"\" (2009) was released for the Wii and features sequences set within \"Code: Veronica\" along with \"Resident Evil 2\". As with previous \"Resident Evil\" titles, the story was adapted into a novel written by S. D. Perry. Also, a mini-series comic was published by DC Comics.\n\n"}
{"id": "1800287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800287", "title": "Shoe polish", "text": "Shoe polish\n\nShoe polish (or boot polish) is a waxy paste, cream, or liquid used to polish, shine, and waterproof leather shoes or boots to extend the footwear's life and restore, maintain and improve their appearance. Shoe polishes are distinguished by their textures, which range from liquids to hard waxes. Solvent, waxes, and colorants comprise most shoe polishes.\n\nShoe polish can be classified into three types: wax, cream-emulsion, and liquid. Each differs in detailed composition but all consist of a mixture of waxes, solvent, and dyes. \n\nWaxes, organic solvents and dyes compose this type of polish. Waxes are 20–40% of the material. Natural waxes include carnauba and montan as well as synthetic waxes. The composition determines the hardness and polishing properties after solvent has evaporated. Solvents are selected to match the waxes. About 70% of shoe polish is solvent. A variety of solvents are used including naphtha. Turpentine, although more expensive, is favored for its \"shoe polish odor\". Dyes make up the final 2–3% of the polish. A traditional dye is nigrosine, but other dyes (including azo dyes) and pigments are used for oxblood, cordovan, and brown polishes. \n\nOwing to its high content of volatile solvents, wax-based shoe polish hardens after application, while retaining its gloss. Poorly blended polishes are known to suffer from blooming, evidenced by the appearance of a white coating of stearin on the polish surface.\n\nThese polishes may have a gelatinous consistency. They are composed of the usual three components waxes, liquid vehicle, and dyes. Unlike wax-based shoe polishes, cream-emulsions contain water and/or oil plus a solvent (either naphtha, turpentine or Stoddard Solution), so the liquid content is high. Emulsifiers and surfactants are required. These include ammonia, morpholine and various ethoxylated surfactants such as polysorbate 80. The waxes are often some mixture of carnauba wax, beeswax, montan wax and its oxidized derivatives, and paraffin waxes.\n\nLiquid shoe polish is sold in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content. Liquid shoe polish is a complex mixture. Polyethylene wax emulsion is a major component. Various polymers, typically acrylates, are the next major component, conferring gloss and holding the dyes in suspension. Resins and casein are selected to ensure adhesion to the leather. Fatty phosphate esters, emulsifiers, and glycols are also used. Pigments include titanium dioxide for whites and iron oxides for browns. Although liquid polish can put a fast shine on shoes, many experts warn against its long-term use because it can cause the leather to dry out and crack.\n\nThe process for producing shoe polish is straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).\n\nShoe polish is manufactured in large, thermostated, stirred reactors. Steps are taken to ensure that volatile solvents do not evaporate. Typically, low-melting paraffin wax is melted, followed by the higher melting waxes, and finally the colorant-stearate mixture. The molten mass is added to warm solvent before being dispensed. Wax-based shoe polish is traditionally packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes. When dried due to solvent loss or other reasons, the hardened wax pulls away from the walls of the container giving what is known as a \"rattler\".\n\nFrom medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, was used to soften and waterproof leather; but it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century many forms of shoe polish became available, yet were rarely referred to as \"shoe polish\" or \"boot polish\". Instead, they were often called \"blacking\", especially when mixed with lampblack, or still were referred to as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.\n\nIn London the Warren brothers, Thomas and Jonathan, started making blacking around 1795–98, initially in partnership and then with competing companies. Jonathan Warren's Blacking company is noted as the first employer of the young Charles Dickens aged 12 in 1823. The competitor to the Warren companies in London is the Day & Martin company formed in 1801.\n\nDetails of the operation of Day & Martin in 1842 reveal that the blacking they produced was in two forms, bottled liquid, and a thick paste which was available in either small wide-mouthed stone tubs, slabs wrapped in oiled paper, or in \"circular tin-boxes, about three inches in diameter, and half or three-quarters of an inch thick\". Tinned blacking paste was at this time exclusively for army use. The text states, \"Yet, as the soldier’s boots or shoes must to some extent emulate the brightness and glitter of the boots of those who pay for battles instead of fighting them, a portable blacking apparatus is provided.\" This confirms the tins as polish rather than dubbin.\n\nIn 1832, James S. Mason of Philadelphia began the commercial production of shoe blacking and inks. In 1851, James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking were labeled as Mason Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 and the building was razed in 1973.\n\nOther early leather preserving products included the Irish brand \"Punch\", which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English man by the name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.\n\nPrior to 1906, shoe polish was not well known as a purchasable product, nor was it particularly sophisticated. While sales were not especially high, a few brands, like \"Nugget\", were available in the UK during the 19th century. The practice of shining people’s shoes gradually caught on and soon many shoeshine boys in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth.\n\nThe first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, Kiwi, and Wren's. An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was Kiwi; Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making \"boot polish\" in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Black and a range of colors became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson.\n\nRamsay named the shoe polish after the kiwi, the national bird of New Zealand; Ramsay's wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, was a native of Oamaru, New Zealand. It has been suggested that, at a time when several symbols were weakly associated with New Zealand, the eventual spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the kiwi's popular appeal and promoted it at the expense of the others.\n\nA rival brand in the early years was \"Cobra Boot Polish\", based in Sydney. Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in \"The Sydney Bulletin\", starting in 1909, using a character called \"Chunder Loo of Akim Foo.\" \"Chunder\" is Australian slang for vomit, and possibly originated through the rhyming slang of \"Chunder Loo\" and spew (another slang word for vomit).\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, leather shoes and boots became affordable to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need in the market for a product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. The polish was also used to shine leather belts, handgun holsters, and horse tack. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including \"Shinola\" and \"Cavalier\" (United States), \"Cherry Blossom\" (United Kingdom), \"Parwa\" (India), \"Jean Bart\" (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. In the German documentary of 1927 \"\", a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a black person.\nShoe manufacturing improvements in the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to a surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.\n\nShoe polish was to be found just about everywhere Allied troops ventured. American war correspondent Walter Graeber wrote for \"TIME\" magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that \"old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay side by side with empty bottles of Chianti.\" A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out.\n\nWhen the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces arrived in Japan—all with boots polished to a degree not known in the U.S. forces—the G.I.s were more conscious than ever of their feet. The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish, but in the superior Australian boot polish, a commodity which was soon exchanged with the Americans on a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish.\n\nSoldiers returning from the war continued to use the product, leading to a further surge in its popularity. While Kiwi shoe polish was what business historian Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. would call a \"first mover\", Kiwi did not open a manufacturing plant in the US until after World War II. Prior to this, Cavalier Shoe Polish, founded by James Lobell, had operated in the US since 1913. The sales paradigm of Cavalier polish was to have footwear professionals sell Cavalier's high-end shoe polish to the shoe-buying public. A few years after World War II, Kiwi opened a manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, making only black, brown, and neutral shoe polish in tins. Kiwi purchased Cavalier in 1961, and continued to manufacture products under the name until the year 2000.\n\nShoe polish products are low-value items that are infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months for even the most frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.\n\nThere are numerous branded products available, as well as generic store brands. There are two chief areas of shoe polish sales: to the general public, and to specialists and trade, such as shoe repairers, and cobblers. The sales percentages between the two outlets are roughly comparable. The best selling, low-cost brands are produced by these companies: Kiwi, Tana, and Johnson, and Reckitt & Colman. Approximately 60 million units are sold annually. Other leading brands include Kelly's, Shinola, Lincoln Shoe Polish, Meltonian, Angelus, Woly, Salamander, Collonil and Cherry Blossom. \n\nKiwi was acquired by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a rise in popularity of high-end shoe polishes, such as Saphir made by Avel and Boot Black made by Columbus.\n\nShoe polish is applied to the shoe using a rag, cloth, brush, or with bare fingers. Shoe polish is not a cleaning product: it is suited for clean and dry shoes. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as \"spit-polishing\" or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This action achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a \"spit shine\" or \"bull\" which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. Polishes containing carnauba wax can be used as a protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.\n\nShoe polish may be purchased pre-soaked into a hard sponge, which can be used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an \"applicator\". \n\nMany products are closely related to shoe polish, but not strictly considered as such. Other chemical products may be used to clean and shine shoes—in particular whiteners for white shoes, and a variety of sprays and aerosols for cleaning and waterproofing suede shoes. A banana peel can also be used to effectively shine shoes, but it is not recommended.\n\nAlthough shoe polish is primarily intended for leather shoes, some brands specify that it may be used on non-porous materials, such as vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be \"neutral\", lacking any intrinsic colour.\n\nShoe polish is such a niche market that its environmental impact is negligible. Solvent evaporation is one issue. Dyes and pigments with \"severe carcinogenic profiles\" have been removed from most formulations.\n\n\n"}

It sat for one term from 3 September 1654 until 22 January 1655 with William Lenthall as the Speaker of the House.\n\nDuring the first nine months of the Protectorate, Cromwell with the aid of the Council of State, had drawn up a list of 84 bills to present to Parliament for ratification. But the members of Parliament had their own and their constituents' interests to promote and in the end not enough of them would agree to work with Cromwell, or to sign a declaration of their acceptance of the \"Instrument of Government\", to make the constitutional arrangements in the \"Instrument of Government\" work. Cromwell dissolved the Parliament as soon as it was allowed under the terms of the \"Instrument of Government\", having failed to get any of the 84 bills passed.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" specified the numbers of MPs that England and Wales sent to the Parliament (400). \n\nBy omission from the list rotten boroughs were abolished. A few boroughs not previously enfranchised, notably Leeds and Manchester, received a seat.\n\nAll the traditional counties were represented (Durham for the first time). In addition some well established sub-divisions of counties were given separate representation. \n\nThere were substantial changes in the number of seats many constituencies received, particularly amongst the counties.\n\nThis was the first systematic redistribution of Parliamentary seats in English history and would not be matched for a Royal Parliament until the Reform Act 1832.\n\nIn the list below, the name of the constituency (as specified in Section X of the \"Instrument of Government\", with minor spelling changes) is followed by the number of seats allocated. The Boroughs in each county follow the county constituency (indicated by boldface and an * after the constituency name). Those areas marked ** were divisions of a traditional county.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" also made provision for members from Jersey and Guernsey, without defining the numbers or arrangements for the election of such members. It is not clear that any were actually elected, as they are not mentioned in the Journal of the House of Commons for this Parliament. It is also notable that when on 6 October and 7 October 1654 the House of Commons debated \"the distribution of the number of members to serve in future Parliaments\", Guibon Goddard MP recorded in his journal that \"we agreed with the Instrument, in the whole number of four hundred, Jersey and Guernsey being left out, because not governed by our laws, but by municipal laws of their own; and we differed but little in the particular distribution.\" \n\nThe Lord Protector and his Council were given power to provide for the representation of Scotland and Ireland, which was done by later legislation giving 30 seats to each country. This was the first time Scotland and Ireland were represented in a Westminster Parliament.\n\nTable 1: Constituencies by type\n\nTable 2: Constituencies, by number of seats\n\n\"Notes: (1) Monmouthshire (3 county seats) included in England, not Wales.

The spelling system is issued by government decree and is compulsory for all government documentation and educational establishments.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the official spelling is regulated by the Spelling Act of 15 September 2005. This came into force on 22 February 2006, replacing the Act on the Spelling of the Dutch Language of 14 February 1947.\n\nThe Spelling Act gives the Committee of Ministers of the Dutch Language Union the authority to determine the spelling of Dutch by ministerial decision. In addition, the law requires that this spelling be followed \"at the governmental bodies, at educational institutions funded from the public purse, as well as at the exams for which legal requirements have been established\". In other cases, it is recommended, but it is not mandatory to follow the official spelling.\n\nThe Decree on the Spelling Regulations 2005 of 2006 contains the annexed spelling rules decided by the Committee of Ministers on 25 April 2005. This decree entered into force on August 1, 2006, replacing the Spelling Decree of June 19, 1996.\n\nIn Flanders, the same spelling rules are currently applied by the Decree of the Flemish Government Establishing the Rules of the Official Spelling and Grammar of the Dutch language of 30 June 2006.\n\nThe modern Dutch alphabet consists of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet and is used for the Dutch language. Five (or six) letters are vowels and 21 (or 20) letters are consonants. The letter \"E\" is the most frequently used letter in the Dutch alphabet. The least frequently used letters are \"Q\" and \"X\". In some aspects, the digraph \"IJ\" behaves as a single letter.\n\nDutch uses the following letters and letter combinations. Note that for simplicity, dialectal variation and subphonemic distinctions are not always indicated. See Dutch phonology for more information.\n\nThe following list shows letters and combinations, along with their pronunciations, found in modern native or nativised vocabulary:\n\nThe following additional letters and pronunciations appear in non-native vocabulary or words using older, obsolete spellings (often conserved in proper names):\n\nLoanwords often keep their original spellings: \"cadeau\" 'gift' (from French). The Latin letters \"c\", \"qu\", \"x\" and \"y\" (from Greek υ) are sometimes adapted to \"k\", \"kw\", \"ks\" and \"i\". Greek letters φ and ῥ become \"f\" and \"r\", not \"ph\" or \"rh\", but θ mostly becomes \"th\" (except before a consonant, after \"f\" or \"ch\" and at the end of words). Combinations \"-eon-, -ion-, -yon-\" in loanwords from French are written with a single \"n\" (\"mayonaise\") except when a schwa follows (\"stationnement\").\n\nVowel length is always indicated but in different ways by using an intricate system of single and double letters.\n\nOld Dutch possessed phonemic consonant length in addition to phonemic vowel length, with no correspondence between them. Thus, long vowels could appear in closed syllables, and short vowels could occur in open syllables. In the transition to early Middle Dutch, short vowels were lengthened when they stood in open syllables. Short vowels could now occur only in closed syllables. Consonants could still be long in pronunciation and acted to close the preceding syllable. Therefore, any short vowel that was followed by a long consonant remained short.\n\nThe spelling system used by early Middle Dutch scribes accounted for that by indicating the vowel length only when it was necessary (sometimes by writing a double vowel but also in other ways). As the length was implicit in open syllables, it was not indicated there, and only a single vowel was written. Long consonants were indicated usually by writing the consonant letter double, which meant that a short vowel was always followed by at least two consonant letters or by just one consonant at the end of a word.\n\nLater in Middle Dutch, the distinction between short and long consonants started to disappear. That made it possible for short vowels to appear in open syllables once again. Because there was no longer a phonetic distinction between single and double consonants (they were both pronounced short now), Dutch writers started to use double consonants to indicate that the preceding vowel was short even when the consonant had not been long in the past. That eventually led to the modern Dutch spelling system.\n\nModern Dutch spelling still retains many of the details of the late Middle Dutch system. The distinction between checked and free vowels is important in Dutch spelling. A checked vowel is one that is followed by a consonant in the same syllable (the syllable is closed) while a free vowel ends the syllable (the syllable is open). This distinction can apply to pronunciation or spelling independently, but a syllable that is checked in pronunciation will always be checked in spelling as well (except in some unassimilated loanwords).\n\n\nA single vowel that is checked in neither is always long/tense. A vowel that is checked in both is always short/lax. The following table shows the pronunciation of the same three-letter sequence in different situations, with hyphens indicating the syllable divisions in the written form, and the IPA period to indicate them in the spoken form:\n\nFree is fairly rare and is mostly confined to loanwords and names. As tense is rare except before , free is likewise rare except before .\n\nThe same rule applies to word-final vowels, which are always long because they are not followed by any consonant (but see below on ). Short vowels, not followed by any consonant, do not normally exist in Dutch, and there is no normal way to indicate them in the spelling.\n\nWhen a vowel is short/lax but is free in pronunciation, the spelling is made checked by writing the following consonant doubled, so that the vowel is kept short according to the default rules. That has no effect on pronunciation, as modern Dutch does not have long consonants:\n\nWhen a vowel is long/tense but still checked in pronunciation, it is necessarily checked in spelling as well. A change is thus needed to indicate the length, which is done by writing the vowel doubled. Doubled does not occur.\n\nA single indicates short and long e but is also used to indicate the neutral schwa sound in unstressed syllables. Because the schwa is always short, is never followed by a double consonant when it represents .\n\nA word-final long is written (or in some loanwords), as an exception to the normal rules. That means that a word-final single will always represent a schwa.\n\nBecause the position of the stress in a polysyllabic word is not indicated in the spelling, that can lead to ambiguity. Some pairs of words are spelled the same, but represents either stressed or or unstressed , depending on how the stress is placed.\n\nThe length of a vowel generally does not change in the pronunciation of different forms of a word. However, in different forms of a word, a syllable may alternate between checked and free depending on the syllable that follows. The spelling rules nonetheless follow the simplest representation, writing double letters only when necessary. Consequently, some forms of the same word may be written with single letters while others are written with double letters. That commonly occurs between the singular and plural of a noun or between the infinitive and the conjugated forms of verbs. Examples of alternations are shown below. Note that there are no examples with because free does not occur in native words:\nThere are some irregular nouns that change their vowel from short/lax in the singular to long/tense in the plural. Their spelling does not alternate between single and double letters. However, the sound becomes in the plural in such nouns, not That is reflected in the spelling.\n\nAs a rule, the simplest representation is always chosen. A double vowel is never written in an open syllable, and a double consonant is never written at the end of a word or when next to another consonant. A double vowel is rarely followed by a double consonant, as it could be simplified by writing them both single.\n\nThe past tense of verbs may have a double vowel, followed by a double consonant, to distinguish those forms from the present tense.\n\nCompounds should be read as if each word were spelled separately, and they may therefore appear to violate the normal rules. That may sometimes cause confusion if the word is not known to be a compound.\n\nFinal devoicing is not indicated in Dutch spelling; words are usually spelled according to the historically original consonant. Therefore, a word may be written with a letter for a voiced consonant at the end of a word but still be pronounced with a voiceless consonant:\n\n\nWeak verbs form their past tense and past participle by addition of a dental, or depending on the voicing of the preceding consonant(s) (see Assimilation (linguistics)). However, because final consonants are always devoiced, there is no difference in pronunciation between these in the participle. Nonetheless, in accordance with the above rules, the orthography operates as if the consonant were still voiced. It is written in the past participle the same as the other past tense forms in which it is not word-final. To help memorise when to write and when , Dutch students are taught the rule \"'t kofschip is met thee beladen\" (\"the merchant ship is loaded with tea\"). If the verb stem in the infinitive ends with one of the consonants of \"'t kofschip\" (-t, -k, -f, -s, -ch or -p), the past tense dental is a -t-; otherwise, it is a -d-. However, the rule also applies to loanwords ending in -c, -q or -x, as these are also voiceless.\n\nThe letters and are somewhat special:\n\nThen, therefore, final devoicing is reflected in the spelling:\n\n\nHowever, and are also written at the end of a syllable that is not final. The pronunciation remains voiced even if the spelling shows a voiceless consonant. This is most common in the past tense forms of weak verbs:\n\n\nCompare this to verbs in which the final consonant is underlyingly voiceless. Here, the dental assimilation rule calls for the ending \"-te\", which gives away the voicelessness of the previous sound even if the spelling of that sound itself does not:\n\n\nSome modern loanwords and new coinages do not follow these rules. However, these words tend to not follow the other spelling rules as well: \"buzzen\" (\"to page (call on a pager)\") → \"buzz\" (\"(I) page\"), \"buzzde\" (\"(I) paged\").\n\nDutch uses the acute accent to mark stress and the diaeresis (trema) to disambiguate diphthongs/triphthongs. Occasionally, other diacritics are used in loanwords. Accents are not necessarily placed on capital letters (for example, the word \"Eén\" at the beginning of a sentence) unless the whole word is written in capitals.\n\nAcute accents may be used to emphasise a word in a phrase, on the vowel in the stressed syllable. If the vowel is written as a digraph, an acute accent is put on both parts of the digraph. Although that rule includes \"ij\", the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted in typing (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is still problematic in most word processing software. If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters – except when the first letter is a capital one. According to the Taalunie, accents on capital letters are used only in all caps and in loanwords. So, it is correct to write \"één\", \"Eén\", and \"ÉÉN\", but not to write \"Één\". The Genootschap Onze Taal states that accents can be put on capital letters whenever the need arises, but makes an exception for \"Eén\".\n\nStress on a short vowel, written with only one letter, is occasionally marked with a grave accent: \"Kàn jij dat?\" (equivalent to the example below), \"wèl\". However, it is technically incorrect to do so.\n\nAdditionally, the acute accent may also be used to mark different meanings of various words, including \"een/één\" (a(n)/one), \"voor/vóór\" (for/before), \"vóórkomen/voorkómen\" (to occur/to prevent), and \"vérstrekkend/verstrékkend\" (far-reaching/issuing), as shown in the examples below.\n\nA diaeresis is used to mark a hiatus, if the combination of vowel letters may be either mistaken for a digraph or interpreted in more than one way: \"geïnd\" (collected), \"geüpload\" (uploaded), \"egoïstisch\" (egoistic), \"sympathieën\" (sympathies, preferences), coördinaat (coordinate), \"reëel\" (realistic), \"zeeën\" (seas). On a line break that separates the vowels but keeps parts of a digraph together, the diaeresis becomes redundant and so is not written: ego-/istisch, sympathie-/en, re-/eel, zee-/en.\n\nThe grave accent is used in some French loanwords and generally when pronunciation would be wrong without it, such as \"après-ski\", \"barrière\" (barrier), \"bèta\", \"caissière\" (female cashier), \"carrière\" (career) and \"hè?\" (\"What?\"), \"blèren\" (to yell). Officially, \"appel\" is always written without an accent, but sometimes an accent is used to distinguish between \"appel\" (\"apple\") and \"appèl\" (\"appeal\", \"roll call\", and others).\n\nBesides being used to mark stress, acute accents are also used in many loanwords (mainly from French) such as \"logé\" (overnight guest), \"coupé\" (train compartment), \"oké\" (okay) and \"café\".\n\nSimilarly, a circumflex accent is also used in some French loanwords, including \"enquête\" (survey), and \"fêteren\" (to treat). For \"gênant\" (embarrassing) it is indecisive, some sources state it should be without the accent since it makes no difference to the pronunciation, others prefer to use the accent. The circumflex accent is also used in West Frisian Dutch and so in general Dutch as well if there is no translation. \"Skûtsjesilen\" is the most common example, where \"silen\" is West Frisian Dutch for \"zeilen\" (to sail) and a \"skûtsje\" is a specific type of sailboat.\n\nAs in English, an apostrophe is used to mark omission of a part of word or several words:\n\nContrary to the city of Den Haag, ’s-Hertogenbosch has decided to retain the more formal orthography of its name for common communication like road signing.\n\nExcept in all caps, the letter immediately following a word-initial apostrophe is not capitalised. If necessary, the second word is capitalised instead:\nOriginally, an apostrophe looked like an elevated comma ( ’ ). Since the introduction of typewriters and, later, computers, the use of a single quote ( ' ) has become common.\n\n\n\n"}

Savage Hall and Centennial Hall) is a multi-purpose arena located in Toledo, Ohio, on the campus of the University of Toledo. \n\nThe arena opened in 1976 and originally seated 9,000 for basketball and up to 10,000 for concerts. As part of a $30 million renovation and addition to the arena, completed in 2008, the seating capacity was reduced to 7,300 for basketball and up to 8,300 for concerts. It primarily serves as the home venue for the Toledo Rockets men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball team, and also hosts concerts, commencement exercises, and other events.\n\nSavage Arena features of space on its arena floor, large enough to accommodate an ice rink, an arena football field, a rodeo ring, five basketball courts, eight volleyball courts, five tennis courts, six racquetball courts, 22 badminton courts, and a 300-yard (274 m) indoor track. There is also a portable stage. The Joe Grogan Room, which seats 200 for dinners, is located at the arena's south side, above the running track. The glass-enclosed room contains a lounge and a bar. More than $350,000 was spent on building and equipping the Joe Grogan Room. All funds for the room were raised through $5,000 pledges by members of the Rocket Club, the athletic department's main support group that now totals more than 1,000 members.\n\nThe arena is built with long span trusses that support the roof, above the arena floor. The trusses also support the arena's public address and ventilation systems, a catwalk system for service and maintenance, and the arena's center-court scoreboard. The arena is named for John F. Savage, a university alum (Class of 1952) who was instrumental in the arena's construction. The free span is from wall to wall. The building structure and wall systems are constructed of noncombustible material.\n\nIn the first game played in Savage Arena, the men's basketball team defeated defending NCAA champion Indiana 59–57. With that win, the Rockets snapped Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers' 33-game winning streak. At Savage Hall, Toledo has beaten Ohio State, Xavier, Cincinnati, Houston and Pittsburgh. The longest consecutive winning streak by the Rockets in Savage Arena is 16 games, during the 1978–79 season. During that streak, UT outscored opponents by an average of 17 points per game. Between November 30, 1978 and December 1, 1981, the Rockets recorded a 45–3 (.938) home record. Prior to the 1985–86 season, they had lost back-to-back games at home only twice in 146 contests.\n\nToledo has won 73.5% of its games at home, posting a 312–112 record. During the first five years in Savage Arena, UT posted a 71–10 (.877) record, with a 15–1 mark in 1976–77 and 1978–79 and a 14–1 slate in 1979–80. Under former head coach Stan Joplin, the Rockets were 84–22 (.792) at Savage Arena. The Rockets have also ranked among the MAC leaders in attendance, averaging 6,640 fans per game since the arena opened in 1976. Last year, Toledo led the MAC with an average attendance of 5,292.\n\nIn 1980–81, the Rockets set a school record with 147,203 in total attendance, the 30th-best total in the nation, and during the 1999–2000 season the Rockets eclipsed the 2.5 million attendance mark in arena history.\n\nIn addition to the activity areas, Savage Arena contains athletic department offices, a reception area, press room, sports medicine and therapy rooms, laundry and equipment facilities and locker rooms with showers and saunas for both men and women. It is also the site of convocations and commencement ceremonies, as well as the occasional conventions.\n\nThe facility has hosted five Mid-American Conference men's basketball tournaments: 1985, 1987–1989, and 1995. In addition, the arena hosted U.S. President George W. Bush and Mexican president Vicente Fox in 2001. WCW used Savage Arena as its Toledo stop until its 2001 folding. \n\nAmong the many performers who have played Savage Arena over the years have been Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Boyz II Men, Steve Winwood, Rod Stewart, Phil Collins, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Sheryl Crow, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Van Halen, Alabama, Charlie Daniel's, The Judds, John Schneider and, more recently, Chris Brown, Katy Perry, The Black Keys, P!nk, Eric Church and American Idols Live!. Of note, Savage Arena hosted Crystal Bowersox's homecoming performance when it hosted the 2010 edition of the latter show. As part of their Promises Tour, the Christian rock band Sanctus Real had their homecoming concert at Savage Arena in 2013. Kiss performed at the arena during their 1997 Reunion Tour, a professionally shot recording of which has been widely bootlegged.\n\nOn July 17, 2006, a gift of $5 million, the largest single gift ever made to the UT athletic department, was donated and earmarked for use on the new Savage Hall update project. These funds were used along with those obtained in a capital raising campaign in order to make major repairs and upgrades to the facility, including an all new athletic center. Final plans included new locker rooms, weight rooms, a pro shop, a Rocket Hall-of-Fame, new ticket offices and a professional office area, as well as revamping of the main arena area which modernized every aspect of the Savage Hall experience. The complex was also renamed Savage Arena. The renovations, which totaled $30 million, were completed in time for the 2008-09 basketball season.\n\nThere are also plans in the works to attach an enclosed indoor practice complex for both the basketball and football teams.\n\n\n"}

Vegetable ivory is named for its resemblance to animal ivory. Species in the genus \"Phytelephas\" (literally \"elephant plant\"), native to South America, are the most important sources of vegetable ivory. The seeds of the Caroline ivory-nut palm from the Caroline Islands, natangura palm from Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, and the real fan palm, from Sub-Saharan Africa, are also used to produce vegetable ivory.\n\nThe material is called \"corozo\" or \"corosso\" when used in buttons.\n\nAn early use of vegetable ivory, attested from the 1880s, was the manufacture of buttons. Rochester, New York was a center of manufacturing where the buttons were \"subjected to a treatment which is secret among the Rochester manufacturers\", presumably improving their \"beauty and wearing qualities\". Before plastic became common in button production, about 20% of all buttons produced in the US were made of vegetable ivory.\n\nVegetable ivory has been used extensively to make dice, knife handles, and chess pieces. It is a very hard and dense material. Similar to stone, it is too hard to carve with a knife but instead requires hacksaws and files.\n\nVegetable ivory is naturally white with a fine marbled grain structure. It can be dyed; dyeing often brings out the grain. It is still commonly used in buttons, jewelry, and artistic carving. Many vegetable ivory buttons were decorated in a way that used the natural tagua nut colour as a contrast to the dyed surface, because the dye did not penetrate deeper than the very first layer. This also helps identify the material.\n"}
{"id": "1800314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800314", "title": "Temerin", "text": "Temerin\n\nTemerin (; , ) is a town and municipality located in the South Bačka District of the autonomous province of Vojvodina in Serbia. The town has a population of 19,613, while the municipality has a population of 28,287.\n\nIn Serbian, the town is known as \"Temerin\" (Темерин), in Hungarian as \"Temerin\", in German as \"Temeri\", and in Croatian as \"Temerin\".\n\nThe territory of the municipality of Temerin lies in the southeast part of Bačka plain. It borders the municipalities of Žabalj to the east, Srbobran to the north, Vrbas to the west, and Novi Sad to the south. \n\nThe most influential factor in the development of Temerin is its proximity to Novi Sad, the economic center of Vojvodina. The territory of the Municipality of Temerin covers the area of around 170 km² (66 mi²), and has a shape of an irregular trapezoid, spreading in the northwest to southeast direction. The longer axis, covering the direction Sirig–Temerin, is 14 km long and the shorter axis, covering the direction Bački Jarak–Temerin, is 11 km long.\n\nThe boundaries of the municipality are largely artificial lines, mostly in rectilinear directions. The only natural boundary of the municipality is on its northeast side where it follows the water current of river Jegrička. On the southeast side the boundary is made with the embankment called Rimski Šanac II.\n\nIn regard to relief shapes of Vojvodina, the entire territory of the municipality is located in a south loessial ridge of Bačka, leaving the impression of an almost-flat surface. The river Jegrička flows through the north side of the municipality with few smaller channeled tributaries. It is established that thermo-mineral waters are present. Soil composition is quite equalized and fertility is naturally high. Different types of chernozem dominate in the area of the municipality. Along the riverbank, swampy dark types of soil and solonchak can be found: these are partly or fully salted soil types.\n\nIn written documents, Temerin is mentioned for the first time in 1332 in the receipt by the pope, issued to Laurentius de Temeri, the parish priest, for the payment of the papal tax. In this time, Temerin was part of the Bacsensis County within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. It remained under control of the Kingdom of Hungary until the battle of Mohács in 1526. After that battle, the settlement first became part of the Serb state of emperor Jovan Nenad (1526-1527) and was subsequently included into the Ottoman Empire, which controlled the area until the end of the 17th century. Administratively, Temerin was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Segedin.\n\nThe list of names of the Serb inhabitants of Temerin is mentioned in the Szeged notebook dating from 1560/61. The local duke’s name was Radica Stepana. There were 20 houses that paid taxes and the whole income of feudal taxes was 5,922 akče. By the end of the 17th century and Ottoman rule, Temerin was devoid of inhabitants.\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, the area was part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and a population was established in the first half of the 18th century. According to D. Ruvarac, in 1722 Temerin was a Serb settlement with 183 Serb houses and three Orthodox priests: Miško, Mihajlo and Petar. In 1769 there were 208 houses, in 1773 there were 183 and in 1786 215 Serb homes. In that year five Serb Orthodox priests lived and worked in Temerin; two of them gave religious services and three of them did not.\n\nGiven Temerin's past wealth, local Serbs built an Orthodox church between 1746 and 1749 and dedicated it to Christ’s ascension into Heaven. It was located at the beginning of today’s Bosanska (Bosnian) street, on its right side, replaced by houses with numbers 2 through 10.\n\nMilitary map and religious books from that same church are proving the existence of the church. Some of them are still kept in the church of Christ’s ascension into Heaven in the village of Đurđevo. The church was made of bricks – solid material (which is important because in the most of the villages churches were made of wood – as log cabins). Church dimensions were: length 17 m, width 6.5 m, walls were nearly 6 m high. The church had church steeple, built just besides main building, 11 special windows with iron bars on them. Johan Milner built the church with assistance and coordination of Visarion Pavlović, the bishop of Bačko-Segedinska eparchy.\n\nAmong church school students is also one of the most notable people from Temerin: the writer, theology professor bishop, and polyglot Lukijan Mušicki, born in 1777 in the town. He was a friend and associate of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, contributing to the Vuk alphabet in adding the letter “đ”.\n\nIn 1796 Chamber sold Temerin and Bački Jarak to count Sándor Szécsen for a price of 80,000 forints. Organized colonization of Temerin by Hungarians started in 1782 and the migration of Germans started in 1787. In that year they founded and settled Bački Jarak, a place which used to be barren area of Bačka until then.\n\nCount Sándor Szécsen tried to turn Serbs into his peasants which resulted in their four years long attempt (from 1796 to 1800) to annex Temerin to the Military Border and its nearest unit battalion of Šajkaš. This attempt failed and on July 21, 1799 they decided to move out of Temerin. Delegation sent by parish commission stopped them in their attempt by postponing their migration. On the same day that commission made a document of a great importance. Document was called “a listing of all Orthodox families from Temerin who came out for migration to the military battalion in the Paška barren area”. This important document contents the names of 178 heads of families that were leaving.\n\nAfter a few months the number of immigrant families raised to 210 families and 1,610 living souls. In the spring of 1800 they tore down their houses and their church and carried all of its building material to Paška barren area where they founded new village named Đurđevo. Name was given because they moved on a St. George day (“Sveti Đorđe”). Only five years later they built a new, even bigger church out of the material they brought with themselves. They dedicated the new church to Christ’s ascension into Heaven, same as they did in Temerin.\n\nFor next 120 years Temerin was almost without Serbs, count Szécsen brought Hungarian settlers, peasants from counties Pest, Fejér and Tolna. Same count ordered building of a very representative palace (castle), so called \"Kaštel\" / \"Kastély\", which is now under state jurisdiction. Nowadays it houses secondary school of techniques.\n\nSzécsen family sold the Temerin property and \"Kaštel\" / \"Кastély\" to grain merchant Antal Fernbah from Apatin. Ana and Petar Fernbah were his heirs and they kept complete Temerin property until agrarian reform in the Kingdom of SHS (Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) in 1920.\n\nIn 1799 Temerin was declared a town and was given a right to hold 4 livestock fairs per year. Catholic Church was built in 1804, and the \"old school\" in 1835. From the 18th century to 1848/1849, Temerin was administratively a part of the Batsch-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848–49, the settlement was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849-1860 part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian crown land. It was part of the Batschka-Torontal District (1849-1850) and Neusatz District (1850–1860) within the voivodeship. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the settlement was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County. Tumultuous times and 1848–1849 revolution did not spare Temerin. In clashes it was burned completely and the settlers migrated to the north, in Bačka Topola, Mali Iđoš, Čantavir and other settlements. After 4–6 months most of them returned to their old homes.\n\nOn July 2, 1899 a railway direction Novi Sad–Temerin–Bečej was built and put in function as well as the railway station in Temerin. That started industrial development of Temerin, putting into operation one brick plant and first steam mills. Temerin soon became one of the important trading centers in the southeast part of Bačka. In the year 1900, Temerin had 9,581 inhabitants, including 8,711 speakers of Hungarian language, 787 speakers of German language, and 13 speakers of Serbian language.\n\nIn 1918, Temerin (as part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region) firstly became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). Creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes marked a new period in the history and the economy of the town. Fernbah's properties were one of the agrarian reform targets. Agrarian authorities from Belgrade and Novi Sad put a new law into effect, colonized farmers from Novi Sad and its vicinity and colonized volunteers. In 1920 started a creation of a new colony of volunteers south of Temerin, 18 km north of Novi Sad and next to road Novi Sad–Bečej–Senta. In the memory of an old Serb settlement in Temerin, settlers named their new settlement Staro Đurđevo (Old Đurđevo) in 1929. At the beginning it had 42 families, now it has grown into a place with over 1,100 households and about 4,000 settlers.\n\nIn 1918-1919, Temerin was part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region and also (from 1918 to 1922) part of the Novi Sad district. From 1922 to 1929, the settlement was part of the Bačka Oblast and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. In 1927, between two World wars, Temerin got electricity.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1944, the settlement was under Axis occupation and was attached to the Bács-Bodrog County within Horthy's Hungary. During the Hungarian military occupation (1941–1944) settlers of Staro Đurđevo and Sirig were expelled from their homes and Hungarian families from Bukovina were settled on this land. In the period 7 to 9 January 1942 48 inhabitants of the town, 42 Jews, and 6 Serbs, were killed during a series of massacres commonly known as the Novi Sad Raid. Since 1944, Temerin was part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina, which (from 1945) was part of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia. In 1944, Hungarians from Bukovina resettled in Hungary, while founders of Staro Đurđevo and Sirig returned to their old settlements. Post-WW2 population censuses recorded Hungarian ethnic majority in the settlement. Population of the town increased from 11,438 in 1948 to 19,613 in 2011. During the 1990s, Serbs replaced Hungarians as the largest ethnic group in the settlement and 2002 census recorded a Serb ethnic majority in Temerin.\n\nThe Municipality of Temerin has three settlements: Temerin, Bački Jarak and Sirig and the territory is divided into four cadastres: Temerin, Bački Jarak, Sirig and Kamendin. Three somewhat separate parts of Temerin town are known as old Temerin, Staro Đurđevo (also known as Kolonija) and Telep. There is also inhabited area known as Kamendin, which is part of the village of Sirig.\n\nAccording to the last official census done in 2011, the municipality of Temerin has 28,287 inhabitants. The municipality of Temerin is a multinational community with 16 different nationalities. The Serbian and Hungarian languages are officially used by municipal authorities.\n\nTrend of population growth in Temerin area is very specific. During the last few centuries’ number of inhabitants increased for 72%.\n\nMigrations largely influenced population structure of Temerin. In 1800 Serbs with 1,610 inhabitants from 210 families left the village and established new one about 20 km east of Temerin. Today it is called Đurđevo and is located near Žabalj. That left Temerin almost without Serbs until 1920. In that year volunteers established new settlement, Staro Đurđevo, which is now local community of the Municipality of Temerin. In 1991 it had 3,718 inhabitants and today more than 4,000 people live there.\n\nBački Jarak, until 1944 was populated with mostly German population, and was during 1946-1947 settled with Serb colonists, mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina; 2,276 settlers came to Bački Jarak. In 1991 Bački Jarak had 6,000 inhabitants.\n\nSirig was colonized as well, in this village 63% of inhabitants are descendants of colonists. During the 1960s and 1970s several hundred families from village Vrbljani (the Municipality of Ključ, Bosnia and Herzegovina) migrated to the local community Staro Đurđevo. Economical situation was reason for that.\n\nTemerin itself was one of the settlements where domicile population was in absolute majority. In 1961, 9,447 inhabitants were in this category, only one third of inhabitants (3,258) were migrants from other places. According to census from 1991 Temerin had 8,174 households; 3,059 of that number were farm households placed in 8,595 apartments. One of the local communities named Staro Đurđevo (3,718 inhabitants), even overgrown a village Sirig (2,546 inhabitants).\n\nFinally, the civil wars on the territory of former Yugoslavia brought to significant changes in the population structure of this municipality. Temerin was a stop point for 9,650 refugees, 4,950 of them still live here at their relatives and friends homes as well as in 4 organized refugee shelters that still exist. These changes brought population number to about 30,000 in 1999.\n\nEthnical population structure of the Municipality of Temerin according to census in 2011:\nAll of the three settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.\n\nEthnical population structure of the town of Temerin according to census in 2011:\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):\nGeographical location of the Municipality of Temerin is very favorable. In the meridian direction the municipality is cut by three important roads. The most important is international road E-75 which drives from Novi Sad towards Subotica and then further to Hungary.\n\nRoad section Novi Sad–Srbobran, cutting the west part of the Municipality of Temerin, was put into use in 1984. The second road by its importance is highway M-22 (since recently international way E-5) which has the nearly the same direction. M-22 leads bit more eastern than E-75 and goes through village named Sirig.\n\nThe third road is one with regional importance (R-120), going through Novi Sad, Bački Jarak and Temerin and leading to Bečej, Senta and Kanjiža. At Sirig and Temerin all these roads are crossed by regional road (R-104) which has Odžaci–Zmajevo–Sirig–Temerin–Žabalj direction. From here a main road leads over Tisa to Zrenjanin and other towns in Banat. Through the southeast part of the municipality and its two settlements—Bački Jarak and Temerin, leads a railway from Novi Sad to Žabalj, Bečej and Senta.\n\nSeats in the municipal parliament won in the 2004 local elections: \n\nSeats in the municipal parliament won in the 2008 local elections: \n\nTerritory of the Municipality of Temerin is a plain terrain with almost imperceptible distinctions in height. If we study relief the southern part of Bačka (in Vojvodina) and we can single out few geomorphological shapes based on soil composition and its genesis. These are Titelski breg – loessial ridge, alluvial ridge of river Danube and inundational planes of river Danube and river Tisa.\n\nTotal area of the Municipality of Temerin is placed in the eastern part of south loessial ridge of Bačka. Heights above sea level vary from 81 m to 83 m. Monotony of Bačka plain is disturbed only by lonely hillocks and valleys of smaller water currents.\n\nBeing a part of Pannonian plain the Municipality of Temerin has its climate characteristics. Pannonian plain is quite far away from the Adriatic or the Mediterranean Sea on the south and the Atlantic Ocean on the west. These distances are even bigger because of Dinarics and Alps mountain ranges which keep the humid airstreams coming from seas and oceans away. Airstreams, influencing weather changes through the year, are conditioned by unequal warming of Earth surface and different atmospheric pressures above Adriatic and Mediterranean, Atlantic Ocean and wide Euro-Asian land. Water surfaces cause breach of humid airflows into Pannonian plain and land surfaces on the north and east influence dry, very cold airstreams in winter and very hot airstreams in summer. Influenced by all of these causes, Pannonian plain has the most continental climate in Serbia.\n\nThere are no longer any natural waterways within the Municipality of Temerin, all having been diverted into canals and included in the DTD hydrosystem, and used for agricultural irrigation.\n\nJegrička is the largest stream on the south loessial Bačka ridge and area of the Municipality of Temerin. Jegrička is a 64.5 km long tributary of Tisa that empties into the Tisa on its right side. The river course was formed during the Holocene, the youngest period of Earth history. At that period ground in the south part of Bačka lowered in a line that was later inherited by this water current.\n\nJegrička is formed from water of few swamps from areas of Despotovo, Silbaš, Parage, Ratkovo and Pivnice. River enters into the Temerin territory on its west side, from the Municipality of Vrbas. The part of Jegrička that flows through the Municipality of Temerin has the length of 18 km which is 28% of its total length. River flows about 1 km north of Sirig and about 2 km north of Temerin. From a place where the river crosses the Temerin–Bečej road it becomes the municipality borderline.\n\nAnalyzing the soil map of Vojvodina we can separate eight different types of soil in the territory of the Municipality of Temerin. The most represented are subtypes of chernozem: carbonated chernozem, carbonated chernozem with signs of earlier contact with swamp, carbonated chernozem with signs of gleying in loess, solonchak chernozem, carbonated and sporadically salted swampy dark soil, meadow carbonated dark soil, swampy noncarbonated dark soil and solonchak.\n\nArea of loessial ridge that covers the biggest part of the Municipality of Temerin resembles steppe grassy vegetation. Development of agriculture during the 18th and 19th centuries brought disappearance of pastures with growing wild vegetation. Cultivation plants were planted; nowadays dominating plants are cereals, industrial plants and vegetables. Fruits and grapevine are not so often.\n\nNarrow areas along rivers and lines of communication are full of wild growing vegetation: wild poppy, corn cockle, spurge, horse basil, meadow buttercup, red clover, yarrow, foxglove, burdock, nettle, chamomile, mustard, etc. Around and in riverbeds you can find plenty of cane, cattail, water lily and alga.\nThere are no bigger forest areas, but around farms (“salaš”) smaller forests of black locust and poplar with few mulberry trees can be seen. Around motels near Sirig and Temerin pine trees have been planted.\n\nAnimal world used to be more numerous and various. Changes in agriculture development caused reduction of total number and number of wild animal species.\n\nField mice and rats live on large areas planted with corn as well as polecats, weasels, ground squirrels, hamsters, hedgehogs and moles. If we look for big game, important for hunting, we can find roe deer, foxes and hares. Of game birds we can find pheasants, partridges, mallards and wild geese as well as rock doves. There are also a lot of other bird species: sparrows, swallows, woodpeckers, starlings, cuckoos, blackbirds, wrens, storks, hooded crows, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of insects: mosquitoes, flees, wasps, bees, gypsy moths, green crickets, hornets, different louses, crickets, ladybugs, moths, butterflies, etc. Among agricultural pests the widest spreads are: potato beetle, turnip beetle, grain weevil and bean weevil.\n\nIn and around water currents live various fishes: carp, bream, robin, pike, perch, as well as other animals: snails, leeches, various frogs, marsh shells, snakes, etc.\nA large number of domestic animals are raised.\n\nThermo-mineral waters in Temerin were first discovered in 1914 and that is also when their exploitation started. At that time a 417 m well hole was drilled. Grisa Andraš was name of the owner. This well cuts through Quaternary and paludina deposits and gives water of . The quantity of water pouring out used to be 397 l/min but has lately been slightly reduced. Since these waters are also present in a depth of 200 to 1000 m, “Naftagas” from Novi Sad drilled a research drill in the center of Temerin in 1968. The drill is 2,004.5 m deep.\n\nChemical analysis was made in 1979 by the Institute of Physics from the University of Novi Sad. The results showed slightly base reaction (rN – 7.8), total mineralization of 2.669 g/l; characteristic ions are sodium (0.708), hydro-carbonate (1.512) and chlorine (0.337). Among other healing ingredients presence of iodine, bromine, fluorine, lithium and strontium is proven.\nAnalysis showed presence of carbon dioxide in water. Methane which was also present was used for heating of water and rooms after separation.\n\nNowadays this thermo-mineral spring is used in contemporary spa bath tubes. A well next to Olympic pool has similar composition and mineralization. Its water is coming from the depth of 690 m and is used for open hot thermo-mineral pool (water temperature is 37 °C). These pools are also used by people from Novi Sad, Žabalj, Kisač, Petrovac and from all other surrounding settlements. This natural wealth is planned to be a basis for future development of a health, sport and tourist complex.\n\n\n\n"}

The terms were coined by Frank DeRemer and Hans Kron in their 1975 paper \"Programming-in-the-large versus programming-in-the-small\". A similar, later distinction is Ousterhout's dichotomy between system programming languages (for components) and scripting languages for glue code, connecting components.\n\nFred Brooks identifies that the way an individual program is created is different from how a programming systems product is created. The former likely does one relatively simple task well. It is probably coded by a single engineer, is complete in itself, and is ready to run on the system on which it was developed. The programming activity was probably fairly short-lived as simple tasks are quick and easy to complete. This is the endeavor that DeRemer and Kron describe as programming in the small.\n\nCompare with the activities associated with a programming systems project, again as identified by Brooks. Such a project is typified by medium-sized or large industrial teams working on the project for many months to several years. The project is likely to be split up into several or hundreds of separate modules which individually are of a similar complexity to the individual programs described above. However, each module will define an interface to its surrounding modules.\n\nBrooks describes how programming systems projects are typically run as formal projects that follow industry best practices and will comprise testing, documentation and ongoing maintenance activities as well as activities to ensure that the product is generalized to work in different scenarios including on systems other than the development systems on which it was created.\n\nIn software development, programming in the large can involve programming by larger groups of people or by smaller groups over longer time periods. Either of these conditions will result in large, and hence complicated, programs that can be challenging for maintainers to understand.\n\nWith programming in the large, coding managers place emphasis on partitioning work into modules with precisely-specified interactions. This requires careful planning and careful documentation.\n\nWith programming in the large, program changes can become difficult. If a change operates across module boundaries, the work of many people may need re-doing. Because of this, one goal of programming in the large involves setting up modules that will not need altering in the event of probable changes. This is achieved by designing modules so they have high cohesion and loose coupling.\n\nProgramming in the large requires abstraction-creating skills. Until a module becomes implemented it remains an abstraction. Taken together, the abstractions should create an architecture unlikely to need change. They should define interactions that have precision and demonstrable correctness.\n\nProgramming in the large requires management skills. The process of building abstractions aims not just to describe something that can work but also to direct the efforts of people who will make it work.\n\nThe concept was introduced by \"Frank DeRemer\" and \"Hans Kron\" in their 1975 paper \"Programming-in-the-Large Versus Programming-in-the-Small\", IEEE Trans. on Soft. Eng. 2(2).\n\nIn computer science terms, \"programming in the large\" can refer to programming code that represents the high-level state transition logic of a system. This logic encodes information such as when to wait for messages, when to send messages, when to compensate for failed non-ACID transactions, etc.\n\nA language that was designed to explicitly support programming in the large is BPEL.\n\nIn software development, programming in the small describes the activity of writing a small program. Small programs are typified by being small in terms of their source code size, are easy to specify, quick to code and typically perform one task or a few very closely related tasks very well.\n\nProgramming in the small can involve programming by individuals or small groups over short time periods and may involve less formal practices (for instance less emphasis on documentation or testing), tools and programming languages (e.g. the selection of a loosely typed scripting language in preference to a strictly typed programming language). Programming in the small can also describe an approach to making a prototype software or where rapid application development is more important than stability or correctness.\n\nIn computer science terms, programming in the small deals with short-lived programmatic behavior, often executed as a single ACID transaction and which allows access to local logic and resources such as files, databases, etc.\n"}

{"id": "1800347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800347", "title": "Zenit (camera)", "text": "Zenit (camera)\n\nZenit () is a Russian (and formerly Soviet) camera brand manufactured by KMZ in the town of Krasnogorsk near Moscow since 1952 and by BelOMO in Belarus since the 1970s. The Zenit trademark is associated with 35 mm SLR cameras. Among related brands are Zorki for 35 mm rangefinder cameras, Moskva (Moscow) and Iskra for medium-format folding cameras and Horizon for panoramic cameras. In the 1960s and 1970s, they were exported by Mashpriborintorg to 74 countries.\n\nThe name is sometimes spelled Zenith in English, such as the manuals published by the UK Zenit-importer TOE. However, TOE's imported camera bodies as from 1963 retained the \"Zenit\" badges. The early Zorki-based models before that time were labelled \"Zenith\" in a handwritten style of script.\n\nDuring the 2018 Photokina expo, Zenit announced that it was resuming camera and lens production for the M-mount, as well as for unspecified Nikon and Canon mounts in 2019.\n\nThe digital Zenit M camera was released in a limited edition set with the Zenitar-M 35mm F/1.0 lens. The camera was produced in partnership with Leica, and the digital components derived to some extent from the full-frame Leica M (typ 240) series. The edition comprised 500 units: fifty units with a black finish and 450 in silver. Russian firmware drives the camera, and the chassis was designed in Krasnogorsk.\n\nTwo further M-mount Zenitar lenses are set for release circa March 2019: the Zenitar-M 21mm F/2.8 and the Zenitar-M 50mm F/1.0.\n\nA second digital camera of an entirely new design is planned for release by 2020; also in collaboration with Leica. This camera will make use of a different lens line.\n\nThe above Zenit was based on the Zorki rangefinder camera (a copy of the Leica II). In transforming the Zorki into an SLR, the simplest approach was taken: the rangefinder housing was removed from the top and replaced by a plain ground-glass screen and prism; a mirror was added below, with a rope-and-pulley setting system and the M39×1 thread mount was pushed forward to make room for the mirror inside.\n\nDuring the first years of production (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the viewfinder showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.\n\nDuring 1967 through 1969 KMZ built an automatic die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production switched to the M42×1 thread (also known as Praktica thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led to one of the most famous Zenits — Zenit-E which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of \"what isn't there, can't go wrong\". Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, the Zenit-E heritage became an obstacle to the development of more modern Zenit models. This was because almost all low-end Zenits until the recent 412DX have been based on the Zenit-E die-cast chassis, complying with the local philosophy that a crude but affordable camera was better than no camera.\n\nThe major events of the further development of Zenit-E line was:\n\nThe Zenit-E was also sold with the Moscow 1980 Olympics emblem.\n\nThe first attempt to make high-end professional camera by KMZ was the Start in 1958. This camera had a full set of shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an automatic diaphragm in a unique breech-lock mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a pentaprism and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the Helios-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.\n\nWith the success of the Zeiss-Ikon Contaflex of the mid-1950s and its follow-ups in form of the Bessamatic, Retina- and Paxette-reflex, Zenit's next attempt was the Zenit-4 (1964), -5 and -6 cameras. These were based on a Voigtländer Bessamatic-type mount with Compur-type iris-shutter near the lens elements. The poor durability and high manufacturing cost of this concept in contrast to the classical barebone Zenit design based on ultimate simplicity showed KMZ to have taken a wrong track: Nevertheless, the Zenit-5 was the first Soviet motor-driven SLR camera, and the first Soviet zoom lens (Rubin-1c 2.8/37–80, based on Voigtländer Zoomar design) featured in the Zenit-6.\n\nFollowing this, there were two more attempts to make high-end photographic equipment, namely the Zenit-7 (1968) and Zenit-D (1969). Both were based on the completely new cloth-curtain shutter construction. The Zenit-D had automatic exposure mode. Its shutter was sped up to achieve X-sync at 1/125. Each of these had its own bayonet mount (\"mount 7\" and \"mount D\" respectively) which helped to utilize the camera's most advanced features. There were plans to develop a full line of optics for these cameras but the new shutter was too complicated and unreliable. Production was cancelled shortly after, and the only lens made for new mounts were the standard types. The Start, Zenit-7 and Zenit-D utilized the same normal lens — a Helios-44 2/58. The Zenit-D is one of the rarest Zenit cameras — only 63 cameras were produced.\n\nThe Zenit 12-XP With its Helios f2/58mm lens and cloth shutter was widely sold by US Eastern camera stores. Many with the Zenit name covered with their \"USA\" brand. This Metallic re-badge was easy enough to gently pry off to see the true name Zenit. The TTL meter was fairly accurate and took decent shots. The 1981 price was $110 usa. The Russians believed that 58mm more closely matched the Human normal range than the standard 50mm used worldwide as a normal lens. It also had a T setting for timed exposures making it a good choice for yearly fireworks displays. The \"T\" setting locked the shutter open allowing a tripod mounted camera to be used with an index card to manually open for few bursts of fire works and then close and reset.\n\nAfter one more unsuccessful camera (Zenit-16) which was produced in very small quantities, in 1979 production of the Zenit-19 began. This was a camera with an original electromagnet-driven focal-plane shutter, M42 lens mount, and shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000. X-sync at 1/60 or 1/125 (camera was modified during production). The camera has only manual shooting mode (with a TTL-meter and a needle indicator of the proper exposition in the viewfinder). The Zenit-19 was, perhaps, the top-of-the-line Soviet M42 lens mount camera.\n\nIn 1984 the Zenit-automat entered production. This had a Pentax K mount (which was proposed as an open standard by Pentax and distributed freely) and a focal shutter with horizontal-travel cloth curtains. The only operation mode was aperture-priority. The camera was modified in 1988, to include shutter FZL-84 with vertical-travel metal curtains, and was reissued as the Zenit-AM. The Zenit-AM2 was a cheaper version of the AM without the self-timer.\n\nNext in line was the Zenit-APK. Its distinguishing feature was the introduction of a manual shutter mode in addition to aperture-priority. The original FZL-84 shutter was also changed to a licensed 'Copal Square' shutter.\n\nThe most recent model is the Zenit-KM of 2001. This is the second microprocessor-controlled camera in the Zenit range (the first one was the second variant of the Zenit-automat camera), and the second (after the Zenit-5) motor-driven SLR camera built by KMZ. Shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1 sec (and up to 16 sec in Auto mode). X-sync is 1/125 sec, and the camera includes both manual shutter and aperture-priority modes as well as DX-coding from 50 to 3200 ISO. In 2004, the KM received some improvements and was renamed to the Zenit-KM Plus\n\nThe Zenit-KM Plus was the final Zenit camera to be produced; all SLR camera production at the Krasnogorsk factory ceased. These highly interesting ultimate Zeniths would have been major sellers on Western markets during the \"SLR-decade\" of the 1970s. However, they appeared at a time when their market-segment was saturated with second-hand equipment, so no major importer looked at them. One of the characteristics of Soviet camera manufacture was that the capability of its designers was well ahead of that of its policy-makers. The 20-year overdue replacement of the external selenium cell of the Zenit E by TTL-metering is said to be the work of an employee who made a conversion on his own accord. \n\nIn the West, the success of the Zenit line can be focused on the United Kingdom, primarily due to the marketing activity and service of TOE, and secondly the originally heavy UK tax-load of up to two-thirds on imported precision cameras.\nSubstantial quantities were later sold by German discounters like Foto-Quelle and Neckermann. The main criticism of the USSR exporters at the time was that they could only supply hopelessly outdated equipment like the Zenit E that they had been directed to produce in quantity, despite having the capacity to produce more technically advanced products that might have been attractive to Western buyers. TOE were fighting a constant battle with their USSR-suppliers in this direction, having to fill the gap left by the excellent but not-for-export Soviet lenses which would have been a major selling-point, by a hodge-podge selection of second-rate mass-market optics from Japan, albeit under the \"Helios\" label.\n\nThe original Zenit came with the sturdy click-stop four-element 3.5/50mm Zeiss Tessar copy under the \"Industar\" designation. Early aluminium variants made in several different bodies were finely blue-coated, whereas the later mass-produced black version was either partially or un-coated with no visible colour on the glass. They were sharp but gave the typically \"foggy\" image of an uncoated lens with bright lighting. With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring it was impossible to focus at full aperture followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus. What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact \"pancake\" design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible body construction, leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945. The most prominent lens is the 6-element 2.0/58mm \"Helios\" based on the pre-war Zeiss Biotar (US Patent 1,786,916 (W.Merté, 1930) Zenit also manufactures several Tair lenses in different focal lengths of which some were of 4-element pre-war Zeiss Sonnar design with the cemented second and ultra-fat third element.\n\nBottom Loading\n\nHinged Back\n\n\nList of Zenit DKL-mount (\"Байонет Ц\") lenses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne oddity of the Zenit camera range is the so-called FotoSnaiper (or Photosniper) kit, which consists of a case (either leather or metal) a gunstock and shoulderstock, filters, a 300 mm f4.5 Tair-3 lens, a normal lens and a Zenit adapted for the gunstock (recognizable by the s designation, Zenit-ES, 122s etc.). The camera is actually held in the same manner as a rifle; hence the name \"Photosniper\".\nProduction Models\n\n\nLow Production and Prototype only\n\n\nZenit manufactured a large range of enlargers as well.

It stars Gérard Depardieu, Anne Brochet and Vincent Pérez. The film was a co-production between companies in France and Hungary.\n\nThe film is the first theatrical film version of Rostand's original play in colour, and the second theatrical film version of the play in the original French. It is also considerably more lavish and more faithful to the original than previous film versions of the play. The film had 4,732,136 admissions in France.\n\nSubtitles are used for the non-French market; the English-language version uses Anthony Burgess's translation of the text, which uses five-beat lines with a varying number of syllables and a regular couplet rhyming scheme, in other words, a sprung rhythm. Although he sustains the five-beat rhythm through most of the play, Burgess sometimes allows this structure to break deliberately: in Act V, he allows it collapse completely, creating a free verse.\n\nIn 2010, \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" was ranked number 43 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\".\n\nCyrano de Bergerac is a Parisian poet and swashbuckler with a large nose of which he is self-conscious, but pretends to be proud. He is madly in love with his cousin, the beautiful Roxane; however, he does not believe she will requite his love because he considers himself physically unattractive, because of his overly large nose. Soon, he finds that Roxane has become infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a dashing new recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, the military unit in which Cyrano is serving. Christian however, despite his good looks, is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love for Roxane, he decides to aid Christian, who does not know how to court a woman and gain her love.\n\nCyrano aids Christian, writing love letters and poems describing the very emotions that Cyrano himself feels for Roxane. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him and they contract a secret marriage in order to thwart the plans of the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant nobleman who is himself a frustrated wooer of Roxane. In revenge, De Guiche summons Christian to fight in the Siege of Arras against the Spanish. The siege is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Cyrano escapes over enemy lines each morning to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane.\n\nChristian, at this time, is completely unaware of Cyrano's doings on his behalf. The love letters Cyrano writes eventually draw Roxane out from the city of Paris to the war front. She had come to visit Christian, the supposed romantic poet. Apparently, she admitted that she would rather love an ugly, but great poet, than a handsome, dimwitted fellow. Christian, realising his mistake, tries to find out whether Roxane loves him or Cyrano, and asks Cyrano to find out. However, during the battle that follows Roxane's visit, Christian is wounded and dies in battle. As he lies dying, Cyrano tells him that he asked Roxane and it was Christian she loved, but he actually has done no such thing. Cyrano fights off the attackers and the French win.\n\nCyrano keeps his love for Roxane a secret for fourteen years, during which time he becomes unpopular because of his writings satirising the nobility. Roxane, grief-stricken, enters a convent. For fourteen years, Cyrano faithfully visits Roxane at her convent every week, never late until a fateful attempt on his life leaves him mortally injured. (He is not wounded by a sword, but instead suffers a serious head injury when struck by a heavy wooden beam.)\n\nOne evening, against doctor's orders, Cyrano visits Roxane at the convent. Although he faints while telling her the court news, he dismisses it as the effect of his wound at Arras. When she mentions Christian's last letter, he asks to read it, but after she gives it to him, he instead is forced to recite it from memory, as it is now too dark for him to be able to read it. Only then does Roxane realise that it was Cyrano who wooed her under the balcony and wrote the love letters. After fainting again, he is forced to reveal his mortal wound to her. As Cyrano dies, Roxane realises that it was he, and not Christian, whom she had really loved all along.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.85/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Love and hope soar in \"Cyrano De Bergerac\", an immensely entertaining romance featuring Gerard Depardieu at his peak.\" On Metacritic, the film has a Metascore of 79 based on 19 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert from the \"Chicago Sun Times\" awarded the film three out of four stars. In his review on the film, Ebert wrote, \"\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" is a splendid movie not just because it tells its romantic story, and makes it visually delightful, and centers it on Depardieu, but for a better reason: The movie acts as if it believes this story. Depardieu is not a satirist - not here, anyway. He plays Cyrano on the level, for keeps.\"\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it \"the definitive screen version of the Edmond Rostand perennial\". In his review, Maltin praised the film's staging of scenes, while also noting that the film somewhat faltered during the finale by being overextended.\n\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" marked the second time that an actor had been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Cyrano; the first time was in 1950, when José Ferrer won the award for his performance in the English-language version of the film.\n\nGérard Depardieu won the Best Actor award at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film was nominated for 13 César Awards in 1991, and received 10, which is a record, including awards for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Director.\n\n\n\nThe film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n\n\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in May 2005 as part of a collection with the 1950 version. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, Umbrella Entertainment trailers, talent biographies, an interview with Gérard Depardieu and a Roger Ebert review. In February 2009 an Academy Award edition was released by Umbrella Entertainment.\n\n\n"}

He is Prefect of the Papal household, and personal secretary to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.\n\nGänswein, who was born in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, is fluent in both speaking and writing Italian, Spanish, German and Latin.\n\nGänswein was born in Riedern am Wald, Waldshut, Baden-Württemberg, a village in the Black Forest and part of Ühlingen-Birkendorf municipality in Germany, as the eldest son of Albert Gänswein, a blacksmith, and his wife Gertrud. He has two brothers and two sisters.\n\nGänswein has said that he decided to become a priest in 1974 when he was 18. He began his seminary training in 1976 and was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Freiburg on 31 May 1984. He spent the next two years in the Black Forest as a curate (assistant priest). \n\nHe received his J.C.D. degree from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1993, writing his dissertation about \"Ecclesiology according to the Second Vatican Council.\" He later said: \"After half a year I was so fed up I said to myself, now I'm going to the archbishop and ask him to take me back into the diocese because I can't stand it anymore... I'd always studied gladly and easily, but studying Canon Law I felt to be as dry as work in a quarry where there's no beer — you die of dryness.\"\n\nIn January 2007, Italian artist and fashion designer Donatella Versace used Gänswein as the artistic inspiration for her Fall 2007 \"Clergyman Collection\", thereby boosting popular recognition of Gänswein's nickname, \"Gorgeous George\" (). In January 2013, Gänswein's photo, without his consent, appeared on the cover of the Italian version of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine.\n\nGänswein entered the Roman Curia as an official of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in 1995.

He replaced Josef Clemens as Ratzinger's personal secretary in 2003, when Clemens became secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Laity. When Ratzinger was elected pope in 2005, Gänswein was appointed Principal Private Secretary to His Holiness. A year later Pope Benedict XVI gave him the title Prelate of His Holiness.\n\nIn an interview in July 2006, he described the Pope's typical day: \"The Pope's day begins with Mass at 7am, followed by morning prayer and a period of contemplation.

He was not to be shaken\", he said. He said the news felt like \"an amputation\" and that \"Accepting and coming to terms with my new role is painful\". He resented that the press welcomed Pope Francis’ decision not to live in the papal apartments and said that \"Benedict didn’t live in the papal apartments for egotistical reasons – he was also very modest\". After several months working for Francis he said \"At the beginning of each day, I find myself once again waiting to see what will be different today\". Then in the evening after 9 pm he handles Benedict's affairs and correspondence.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Gänswein said that \"I am certain, indeed convinced, that history will offer a judgment that will be different than what one often read in the last years of his pontificate because the sources are clear and clarity springs from them.\" In 2016 he said that \"Vatileaks\" or other issues had \"little or nothing\" to do with Benedict's resignation. Gänswein said that Francis and Benedict are not two popes \"in competition\" with one another, but represent one \"expanded\" Petrine Office with an \"active\" member and a \"contemplative\" one. He said that Benedict had not abandoned the papacy like Pope Celestine V in the 13th century but rather sought to continue his in a more appropriate way given his frailty and that \"Therefore, from 11 February 2013, the papal ministry is not the same as before. It is and remains the foundation of the Catholic Church; and yet it is a foundation that Benedict XVI has profoundly and lastingly transformed by his exceptional pontificate.\"\n\nIn January 2015 Gänswein denied a rumour that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI had met the previous fall with conservative cardinals concerned that the Synod of Bishops on the Family might allow civilly remarried Catholics access to the Eucharist. He called it \"pure invention\". He said Francis' renewed emphasis on pastoral care meant no change in doctrine and said: \"The pope is the first guarantor and keeper of the doctrine of the Church and, at the same time, the first shepherd, the first pastor.\"\n\nIn July 2017, some commentators interpreted a statement by Benedict as criticism of Francis. Gänswein called them \"stupid people\" and said they engaged in \"fantasy\". He said that \"The emeritus pope was deliberately exploited\" and that \"They want to exploit him. But all this will be useless.\"\n\nIn 2019 he said a claim put forward by a Brazilian synod father that Benedict XVI revised canon law in 2009 to allow the ordination of women deacons is “totally absurd and wrong.” Archbishop Gänswein said he had not spoken to the Pope Emeritus about the matter and his comments “come only from me.” His remarks come after Bishop Evaristo Pascoal Spengler of Marajó, Brazil, told reporters that the synod had opened a path to the ordination of women deacons due to a 2009 decree.\n\nIn January 2020, Gänswein asked Cardinal Robert Sarah to have his publishers remove Pope Benedict’s name as co-author with Sarah of a book about priestly celibacy, and to remove Benedict’s name as author of the book's introduction and conclusions. He said Benedict had not participated in the writing nor authorized the use of his name. He characterized the problem as \"a question of misunderstanding, without casting doubt on the good faith of Cardinal Sarah\". Sarah had already denied that characterization of Benedict's role, but then asked his publishers to make changes in how Benedict’s participation was represented, though his U.S. publisher refused to make any adjustment. \n\nFollowing his dispute with Sarah, Gänswein ceased to perform the public functions of his position as prefect of the papal household. He no longer appeared alongside Pope Francis at the pope's weekly audiences, nor greeted heads of state and the pope's other most important visitors. His title did not change. The Holy See Press Office said Gänswein's role reflected a \"redistribution of the various commitments and duties\" of papal household staff.\n\nIn March 2014 he said he was shocked by the election of Pope Francis. Asked on ZDF on 13 March whether the election of Pope Francis at the conclave the previous year had surprised him, Archbishop Gänswein said, “Well, yes, as I had favoured other candidates – I was wrong – but then so were other people.” He went on to say that at the moment the Pope is the darling of the media “but that won’t always be the case”. The Pope is not “everybody’s darling”, he said.\n\nArchbishop Gänswein said that marriage cannot be dissolved and that \"starting a new union contradicts what the Lord has indicated\". He made the remarks in an interview with Chi magazine, excerpts of which were released in advance on the fringes of a synod of bishops on the family that opened 6 October 2014 in the Vatican. Asked about the question of possibly allowing divorced people to take communion, Gänswein said \"this is a very delicate question, at stake is the sacramental matrimony that according to Catholic doctrine cannot be dissolved, just like the love of God for man\" \"As far as I can see Pope Francis is following the line of his predecessors whose teaching on matrimony is very clear\".\n\nGänswein said: “I personally can see no significant reason which would necessitate a reform of the Curia at the moment. One or two changes have been made but that is part of the normal run of things. To speak of ‘Curial reform’ is, if I may so, somewhat of an exaggeration.” Asked whether the Vatican and the Church in general are polarised at the moment, he said \"There is no polarisation as far as I can see and I haven’t experienced any. Certain measures here and there have been criticised and if the criticism is justified, that can surely benefit the general climate.\"\n\nIn 2017, asked about the dismissal of Cardinal Gerhard Müller from his post as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Gänswein said: \"I don't want to comment on a papal staff decision. But when I heard about it I was really most upset. He is, after all, a close personal friend.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800379", "title": "Karl Blind", "text": "Karl Blind\n\nKarl Blind (4 September 1826, Mannheim – 31 May 1907, London) was a German revolutionist and writer on politics, history, mythology and German literature.\n\nWhile a student at Heidelberg, he was imprisoned for his revolutionary activity, perhaps in consequence of a pamphlet he wrote entitled \"\"German Hunger and German Princes.\"\" During the risings of 1848, he participated in the uprising in the Grand Duchy of Baden led by Friedrich Hecker, and had to flee, wounded. The next year, he joined the band of liberals headed by Gustav Struve which invaded southern Germany. He was taken prisoner and sentenced to eight years' confinement, but after eight months in prison, he was freed by a revolutionary mob while being taken to Mainz. He then went to Karlsruhe, whence he was sent by the provisional government of Baden as an envoy to Paris. Expelled from France, he went to Brussels, and then in 1852 found refuge in England, where he interested himself in democratic movements, and cultivated his literary as well as his political proclivities by contributing to magazines, and otherwise. He maintained an active correspondence with other democratic leaders, like Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Louis Blanc.\n\nMany Europeans expected a unified Germany to become a European and world leader and to champion humanitarian policies. This is demonstrated in the following letter written by Garibaldi to Blind on 10 April 1865:\n\nThe progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation which possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples, but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed. We need the kind of leadership which, in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life, and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression.\n\nThis role of world leadership, left vacant as things are today, might well be occupied by the German nation. You Germans, with your grave and philosophic character, might well be the ones who could win the confidence of others and guarantee the future stability of the international community. Let us hope, then, that you can use your energy to overcome your moth-eaten thirty tyrants of the various German states. Let us hope that in the center of Europe you can then make a unified nation out of your fifty millions. All the rest of us would eagerly and joyfully follow you.\n\nAfter 1866, Blind's writings became less revolutionary in tone. \n\nKarl Blind was pardoned by the Baden government in 1867.\n\nKarl Blind married a widow, Friederike Cohen (née Ettlinger) around 1849. They had known each other for several years and been imprisoned together in 1847. They had two children together, Rudolph (born 1850, died February 1916) and Ottilie (died 1929). She already had a daughter, Mathilde, and son, Ferdinand from her first marriage. \n\nHis stepson, Ferdinand Cohen-Blind (1844-1866) attempted in May 1866 to assassinate Bismarck and then committed suicide in prison. His stepdaughter, Mathilde Blind (1841-1896), adopted his name over her father's, and became a well-known poet.\n\nAfter moving to Hampstead, London, Blind's family embraced the English education system and interests. Ottilie was involved in supporting women's suffrage, home rule for Ireland and the League of Nations. She organised working parties for the Serbian Red Cross during the First World War. She married a barrister Charles Hancock. She is now best known for her endowment in 1925 of the Ottilie Hancock and Hertha Ayrton Fellowships at Girton College, Cambridge. Rudolph was educated at University College School and the Royal Academy. He was an artist and illustrator. His best known works were \"The Golden Gates\", \"Christ the Consoler\", \"The World’s Desire\" (subject to two court cases, one against the artist for alleged obscenity and indecency while the other was for delivery of the picture and damages against the artist's wife), \"Love’s Extasy\", and \"The Throne of Grace\". He married Annie Sarah and they had 3 sons.\n\nBlind published a great number of political essays and brief articles on history, mythology, and German literature. Among his works are:\n\n\nAdditionally, he wrote biographies of Ferdinand Freiligrath, Alexandre Ledru-Rollin, and Francis Deák.\n\n\nIn 1897 he contributed an autobiographical sketch to the \"Cornhill Magazine\", London.\n\n\n"}

He studied at Erlangen where he became a university tutor. In 1819 he became an extra-Ordinary Professor of Chemistry at Bonn, and in 1822 a full professor. The University of Bonn was a leading center for geologists including Ferdinand von Roemer, Georg August Goldfuss, and Gerhard vom Rath as well as Bischof.\n\nBischof himself has been considered the founder of chemical geology. More a chemist than a geologist, he introduced chemical analysis into widespread use in geology. His \"Lehrbuch der chemischen und physikalischen Geologie\" (Bonn: Marcus, 1847−1866) was the standard text of geochemistry and a classic reference work. The first volume (in 2 parts) considers the actions of water both on the earth and internal to it, including the temperature, chemical composition and effects of springs on rocks around them. His was the first account to scientifically address springs. Volume II (in 7 parts) discusses mineralogy, petrology, and the origin of rocks. He describes the chemical composition, structure, texture, and the chemical and mechanical forces involved in the decomposition of minerals and rocks, including the effects of decomposing organic remains. In doing so, he created a new branch of geology. Bischof's work was highly valuable for its extensive and careful chemical analyses. Bischof was less successful in the interpretations he placed on his results, as he supported theories of Neptunism, later disproved.\n\nAddressing dynamical geology, he noted that substances such as carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid, and other gases as well as water vapor played a part in volcanic eruptions. By studying the cooling of large balls of melted basalt, Bischof estimated the possible cooling time of the planet earth, arriving at a value of 350 million years. He also experimented with variations in cooling temperature, observing that manipulations of temperature and pressure during cooling could lead to the formation of different crystalline forms. He suggested that the both asphalt and petroleum were likely derived from decaying plant matter, and predicted that the effects of air, heat and pressure might explain the formation of different types of coal. He studied experimented on inflammable gases such as those found in coal mines. He experimented with the development of safety-lamps and wrote an essay on the avoidance of explosions in mines.\n\nIn 1859, Bischof was elected as member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Bischof was awarded the Wollaston Medal in 1863 by the Geological Society of London. The society's highest award, it is given for \"significant influence by means of a substantial body of excellent research in either or both pure and applied aspects of the science\" of geology.\n\nGustav Bischof died in Bonn on November 30, 1870.\n"}

A head normal form is a term that does not contain a beta redex in head position, \"i.e.\" that cannot be further reduced by a head reduction. When considering the simple lambda calculus (viz. without the addition of constant or function symbols, meant to be reduced by additional delta rule), head normal forms are the terms of the following shape:\n\nA head normal form is not always a normal form, because the applied arguments formula_20 need not be normal. However, the converse is true: any normal form is also a head normal form. In fact, the normal forms are exactly the head normal forms in which the subterms formula_20 are themselves normal forms. This gives an inductive syntactic description of normal forms.\n\nThere is an additional notion of weak head normal form (whnf): a term is in whnf if it is not an application, and it is not starting with a constant or function symbol. formula_22 is in whnf because it is an abstraction. formula_23 is in whnf because it starts with a function symbol, namely formula_24.\n\nIn general, a given term can contain several redexes, hence several different beta reductions could be applied. We may specify a strategy to choose which redex to reduce.\n\n\nNormal-order reduction is complete, in the sense that if a term has a head normal form, then normal‐order reduction will eventually reach it. By the syntactic description of normal forms above, this entails the same statement for a “fully” normal form (this is the standardization theorem). By contrast, applicative order reduction may not terminate, even when the term has a normal form.

{"id": "1800463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800463", "title": "Sam and Twitch", "text": "Sam and Twitch\n\nSam Burke and Maximilian \"Twitch\" Williams are two fictional NYPD homicide detectives, created by Todd McFarlane. Sam and Twitch were originally featured in McFarlane's hit comic series \"Spawn\". Due to their popularity, they were later given their own title in 1999, called \"Sam and Twitch\". In their self-titled series, the duo were the protagonists in a dark and gritty New York City. The fictional universe of \"Sam and Twitch\" is somewhat different from average comics in which costumed heroes are not the norm.\n\nDetective Sam Burke is often seen as the brawn of the group. Sam is a large, headstrong man with a penchant for foul language and gruff behavior. Sam is usually the one to take \"action\" against any type of villain they encounter. Though Sam has often been accused of police brutality, the charges have never stuck. In fact, Sam takes great pride in being one of the few honest cops in a precinct he sees as infested with corruption and scandal. Although his style with criminals is rough, and he comes across as boorish to most others, he's actually quite compassionate, beneath his rough exterior, to those in need. He has a real passion for doing the right thing and seeing justice done, even if he has to resort to not-so-civil means. Sam is very protective of those few he trusts and considers friends, especially his partner Twitch. Twitch's dedication to his work despite the corruption of the Police department is shown to be inspiring to Sam, and he often goes to great lengths to protect Twitch from even their fellow officers, who may mean verbal or physical harm to Sam's highly intelligent, diminutive partner.\n\nDespite his down-and-dirty, cynical, and hot-tempered personality, Sam is essentially a good man, with a strong sense of duty and honor. His straightforward ways have often put the detective duo at odds with even their fellow police, but while Twitch is considerably more reasonable than his larger partner, (and often pokes fun at Sam's fiery temperament and statements) he shows a deep trust and respect for him as well. While Twitch often figures out and solves the duo's various cases and predicaments, Sam is unquestionably the drive and conviction which sees the two through.\n\nWhile not as talented as Twitch in deduction, Sam is skilled in being able to see through people and getting information. Even with a large and fat build, Sam has shown considerable strength, speed and durability in fighting superhuman foes. He's capable of going toe-to-toe in a fistfight against the Udaku, who's powerful enough to rip a man's head off. Sam has also displayed some form of police intuition that warns him of traps and lies, which he jokingly calls a \"spider-sense\".\n\nMaximilian Steven Percival \"Twitch\" Williams III is mainly seen as the \"brains\" of the partnership. He is the one who usually solves or puts the pieces together in the rare crimes the detectives encounter. A brilliant mathematician who excelled at trigonometry, he has used his knowledge of angles to become an excellent marksman. A shooting prodigy, Twitch makes up for his small size with his ability to handle twin pistols with extreme accuracy and efficiency. He claims to have earned the nickname \"Twitch,\" as Sam once said, \"because he doesn't, ever!\" In reality, \"Twitch\" was his despised high-school nickname, which Sam learned after intercepting a reunion invitation asking for 'Twitch' Williams. He refers to Sam Burke as \"sir\", as throughout the years Sam has, time and time again, earned his trust and respect.\n\nTwitch was once married and has several children, but due to his busy schedule with crime cases, his wife eventually divorced him, and denies him custody of his kids. This had a great emotional impact on Twitch, but did not seem to hinder him from his work. He eventually reconciled with his wife and since then does his best to spend as much time with his family as his duty allows. Twitch comes from a family with a proud tradition in law enforcement, his father and siblings all being cops themselves. Despite his reserved and soft-spoken manner, he is extremely passionate and proud of his job, in some ways more so than Sam. It is because of this that, despite his incredible intelligence, the apparent rampant corruption of the Police Department, which he works for, troubles him greatly. In some ways, Twitch is a little more naïve than the street-smart and more realistic Sam, and has had to deal with many harsh truths.\n\nTwitch has battled against many super-human foes such as Overt-Kill, a monstrous, mafia-hired cyborg. Despite Overt-Kill's seemingly bulletproof exterior, Twitch was able to defeat him with a single, well-aimed bullet through Overt-Kill's ear canal.\n\nSam and Twitch were originally introduced in the comic book series \"Spawn\" as tertiary characters to the larger storyline of Al Simmons. The duo were at first at odds with Al, both due to Al's questionable methods and personality and Al's own distrust of the police. Eventually however, they had come to form a mutual respect and Al often sought help from the two, seeing them as two of the only people, cops, no less, that he could actually trust. Even after the detectives' own spin-off series had started the two often made appearances in Spawn.\n\nDue to issues with publishing, \"Sam and Twitch\" was not always released in a timely manner. This affected sales. The series was subsequently cancelled in 2003 with only 26 issues after a four-year run. The delays continued until the end.\n\nThe character Spawn makes a small cameo appearance in \"Sam and Twitch\" and requests the duo's help.

A friend of the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, he was a many-sided man: a doctor, a naturalist, a scientist, a psychologist, and a landscape painter who studied under Caspar David Friedrich.\n\nIn 1811 he graduated as a doctor of medicine and a doctor of philosophy. In 1814 he was appointed professor of obstetrics and director of the maternity clinic at the teaching institution for medicine and surgery in Dresden. He wrote on art theory. From 1814 to 1817 he taught himself oil painting working under Caspar David Friedrich, a Dresden landscape painter. He had already taken drawing lessons from Julius Diez and subsequently studied under Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld at the Oeser drawing academy.\n\nWhen the King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus II, made an informal tour of Britain in 1844, Carus accompanied him as his personal physician. It was not a state visit, but the King, with Carus, was the guest of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Windsor Castle, and Carus was able to visit many of the sights in London and the university cities of Oxford and Cambridge, and meet others active in the field of scientific discoveries. They toured widely in England, Wales and Scotland, and afterwards Carus published, on the basis of his journal, \"The King of Saxony's Journey through England and Scotland, 1844\".\n\nHe is best known to scientists for originating the concept of the vertebrate archetype, a seminal idea in the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. In 1836, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Carus is also noted for \"Psyche\" (1846).\n\nCarl Jung credited Carus with pointing to the unconscious as the essential basis of the psyche.\n\nCarus died in Dresden. He is buried in the Trinitatis-Friedhof (Trinitatis Cemetery) east of the city centre. The grave lies in the south-west section, against the southern wall.\n\nHis daughter Charlotte Carus married the artist Ernst Rietschel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As per the prearranged agreement, Jay has brought something of value to contribute to the club: a telescope that belonged to his father (who has been missing several years and is presumed dead). However, Keith double-crosses Jay and takes the telescope, denying him admission into the club. Jay tries to retrieve the telescope with the help of his physically disabled friend Donna, who uses a crutch and a leg brace in order to walk. Jay falls from the tree-fort, however, striking his head against a rock and lapsing into a coma.\n\nIn the coma, Jay finds himself in a fantasy world called Downworld where no one reaches the age of 16. Not having heard of adults, the children here have shaped society in their own ways, forming mostly tribal clans in the form of Clubs, such as the Pool Club and the Library Club. The biggest and most powerful Club, however, is the Tower, a brutal despotic police state run by the oldest kids, with Brad as the absolute ruler because he is 15, and \"knows everything\". Jay, not knowing how he has got here and aided by his friends Alpha and Flash (who are identical to Donna and Keith), embarks on a journey to return home — a place he can't remember. The journey becomes a quest to find his long-lost father, whose name happens to be Brad, who fell overboard from a small boat into a lake while they were on a fishing trip together and has not been seen since.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay's mother and a coma therapist try to get Jay to regain consciousness, with the help of his friends.\n\nA turning point is reached when Jay's father appears to him as he is regaining consciousness, which Jay is forced to keep as a secret from his mother.

The town is located on the north bank of the Danube-Tisa-Danube canal. The town has a population of 12,009, and the municipality of 16,317.\n\nThe municipality of Srbobran encompasses of town of Srbobran, and two villages: Nadalj and Turija.\n\nIn Serbian, the town is known as \"Srbobran\" (Србобран); in Hungarian as \"Szenttamás\" () or \"Szrbobran\" (formerly also \"Bács-Szenttamás\"); in Rusyn (a Cyrillic-only language) as /Србобран/; in Croatian as \"Sveti Tomo\", \"Senttomaš\" or \"Srbobran\"; in Slovak as \"Srbobran\"; and in German as \"Thomasberg\" or \"Sankt Thomas\". The name \"Srbobran\" means \"Serbs' defender\" in Serbian. Older Serbian name used for the town was \"Sentomaš\" (Сентомаш).\n\nAccording to archaeology, there was human settlement in the territory of present-day Srbobran in the prehistoric times. The first written record about the settlement is from 1338, in which the Srbobran is mentioned under name \"Sentomas\", which means Saint Thomas, i.e. the apostle Thomas, who was the patron saint of a monastery and of the village around it in the Middle Ages. During this time, the area was under administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary and was part of the Bacsensis County. This village, together with the monastery, became destroyed during the Ottoman conquest in the 16th century. Its former population left the region and fled towards North to Habsburg Royal Hungary. During the Ottoman administration, the settlement of Sentomaš was rebuilt and was populated by ethnic Serbs. It was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Segedin.\n\nAfter the Bačka region was captured by Habsburg troops led by Prince Eugene of Savoy in the end of the 17th century, a settlement was included into Habsburg Monarchy and was populated by new colonists, mainly by ethnic Serbs from the South, but also (since the second half of the 18th century) by ethnic Hungarians from the North, who became the second largest ethnic group in the settlement (after Serbs). The settlement was part of the Military Frontier until 1751, when it came under the civil administration. A document from 1751 indicates that besides name \"Sentomaš\", the name \"Srbograd\" (Serb Town) was also used as a non-official denomination for the town. The development of the town was fast; in 1787 its population was 3,532, while in 1836 this number rose to 11,321. From 1751, the town was part of the Theiss District within the Batsch-Bodrog County and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe name \"Srbobran\" dates from the time of 1848/1849 revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy, but was officially used since 1918. In 1848-1849, the town was part of Serbian Voivodship, a Serbian autonomous region within the Austrian Empire. The Serbian defense line was located near this town, hence the name \"Srbobran\", which means \"Serbs's defender\". On July 14, 1848, the first siege of the town by Hungarian forces began under Baron Fülöp Berchtold who was forced to retreat due to a strong Serbian defense. The Hungarian troops captured Sentomaš for the fourth trial, on April 4, 1849, and burned the town to the ground. Having suppressed the Hungarian anti-Habsburg movement (in 1849), Austrian authorities established a new province to which Sentomaš belonged to: the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, which existed until 1860. In 1850, the population of Sentomaš was 5,630 people, which was only about half of the population recorded in 1836. After abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, Sentomaš was again included into the Batsch-Bodrog County. Since the establishment of the dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, the town was located within the Hungarian part of the Monarchy. According to the official census of 1910, Sentomaš had 14,335 inhabitants, among them 7,808 (54.47%) spoke Serbian language, 6,031 (42.07%) spoke Hungarian language, and 430 (3%) spoke German language.\n\nSentomaš became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which is called Yugoslavia since 1929) in 1918 and was officially named Srbobran. In 1918-1919, the town was part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region and also (between 1918 and 1922) part of the Novi Sad County. Between 1922 and 1929 it was part of Belgrade Oblast, and between 1929 and 1941 part of Danube Banovina. In 1941, the town was occupied by the Axis Powers and was attached to the Horthy's Hungary. \nIn 1944, the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis troops from the region, at this time approximately 2000 civil people with Hungarian nationality was killed by revenge. \nSrbobran was included into the autonomous province of Vojvodina within new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1945, Vojvodina is part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. Until the 1950s, Srbobran was part of the Bečej municipality, but then separate municipality of Srbobran was established. During the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, some Serb refugees came from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, and settled in Srbobran.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of the Srbobran municipality is composed of:\n\nAll of the three settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority. The Serbian and Hungarian language are officially used by municipal authorities.\n\nAlso see: Serbs in Vojvodina, Hungarians in Vojvodina, Romani people of Vojvodina.\n\nIn 2011, Srbobran town has a population of 12,009, including:\n\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):\nTown is located near to the M22 motorway between Belgrade and Subotica. There are two national highways that run through the town, highways 3 and 22. These three important routes make the town an important transport link.\n\nHighway 3 runs west to Sombor, and east to Bečej. Highway 22 runs to Budapest in Hungary to the north changing to Highway 5 in Hungary, and to Ribarice, in the south of Serbia.\n\nThere are two notable buildings in Srbobran, both of which are churches (one is Serb Orthodox, the other one is Roman Catholic) and both are built in highly sophisticated late baroque style.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her father was a political reporter and journalist for the \"New York World\". Her parents divorced when she was still a child. In June 1949, Oliver joined her mother in Southern California, where Ruth was in the process of becoming a well-known Hollywood astrologer. Oliver made a decision to embark upon a career as an actress and chose the stage name Susan Oliver.\n\nBy September 1949 and using her new name, Oliver returned to the East Coast to begin drama studies at Swarthmore College, followed by professional training at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. After working in summer stock and regional theater, and in unbilled bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series \"Goodyear TV Playhouse,\" and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.\n\nOliver did numerous TV shows in 1957, and appeared on stage. She began the year with an ingenue part, as the daughter of an 18th-century Manhattan family, in her first Broadway play, \"Small War on Murray Hill,\" a Robert E. Sherwood comedy. That same year, Oliver replaced Mary Ure as the female lead in the Broadway production of John Osborne's play \"Look Back in Anger.\"\n\nThe play's short run was immediately followed by larger roles in live TV plays on \"Kaiser Aluminum Hour,\" \"The United States Steel Hour\", and \"Matinee Theater.\" Oliver then went to Hollywood, where she appeared in the November 14, 1957, episode of \"Climax!,\" one of the few live drama series based on the West Coast, as well as in a number of filmed shows, including one of the first episodes of NBC's \"Wagon Train,\" \"Father Knows Best,\" \"The Americans,\" and \"Johnny Staccato.\"\n\nIn July 1957, Oliver was chosen for the title role in her first motion picture, \"The Green-Eyed Blonde,\" a low-budget independent melodrama scripted by Dalton Trumbo (under a pseudonym), and released by Warner Bros. in December on the bottom half of a double bill. It is the only motion picture on which Oliver received top billing. \n\nIn mid-1958, Oliver began rehearsals for a co-starring role in \"Patate,\" her second Broadway play. Its seven-performance run was even shorter than that of \"Small War on Murray Hill,\" but won Oliver a Theatre World Award for \"Outstanding Breakout Performance\"; it was her last Broadway appearance.\n\nOn April 6, 1960, the 28-year-old Oliver played a spoiled young runaway, Maggie Hamilton, who gets soundly spanked by scout Flint McCullough (Robert Horton), in \"The Maggie Hamilton Story\" on NBC's \"Wagon Train\". McCullough searches for her so the wagon train can proceed on schedule, and after rescuing her from some drunken hooligans and an Indian played by Leonard Nimoy, he is rewarded by her biting him and pulling his gun on him. On November 9, 1960, she was cast as the lead guest star in \"The Cathy Eckhart Story\" on \"Wagon Train\", with husband-and-wife actors John Larch and Vivi Janiss as Ben and Sarah Harness.\n\nOliver was cast in the 1960 episode of \"The Deputy\" as the long-lost daughter of star Henry Fonda's late girl friend, and appeared in \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre\" episode \"Knife of Hate\" as Susan Pittman. In 1961, Oliver played the part of Laurie Evans in the episode \"Incident of His Brother's Keeper\" on CBS's \"Rawhide\", and in 1963, she played Judy Hall in the episode \"Incident at Spider Rock\", Also in 1962, Oliver appeared as Jeanie in the television series \"Laramie\" in the episode \"Shadows in the Dust\".\n\nOliver was cast in episodes of \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"Twilight Zone\", \"Route 66\", \"Dr. Kildare\", \"The Naked City\", \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\", \"Burke's Law\", \"The Fugitive\", \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", \"I Spy\", \"The Virginian\", \"The Name of the Game\", and \"Mannix\". She made one appearance on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and ABC's family Western series, \"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters\". She also made two appearances in Quinn Martin's \"The Invaders\" (episodes: \"Inquisition\" and \"The Ivy Curtain\") on ABC .\n\nHer most challenging role during this time was as the ambitious wife of doomed country music legend Hank Williams (George Hamilton) in \"Your Cheatin' Heart\" (1964). The same year, she also starred opposite Jerry Lewis in \"The Disorderly Orderly\", and appeared in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E\" (1965) and \"The Love-Ins\" (1967) with Richard Todd. \n\nOliver appeared in television films, including \"Carter's Army\". She had a continuing role as Ann Howard on ABC's primetime serial \"Peyton Place\" in 1966.\n\nOliver played the female lead character Vina in \"\" (1964), which was the first pilot of Gene Roddenberry's new show, \"\". Two years later, Oliver's performance was reused in the first season, two-part episode \"\" (1966). The framing device was needed because of significant format and cast changes, and because the special optical effects used by the series were taking longer to complete than anticipated, which made missing an air date a real possibility. In particular, Jeffrey Hunter played \"Captain Christopher Pike\" in the pilot episode, but was replaced by William Shatner as \"Captain James T. Kirk\" of the Starship\" Enterprise\" when the series was green-lit by NBC in 1966.\nFor the fantasy sequence in the pilot, in which her character appeared as an \"Orion slave girl\", Oliver was covered in green makeup all over her body, and a dark brunette wig. A still of her with green skin is frequently seen in the end credits of the TV series, and it has since become an iconic image of \"Star Trek\". Hence, the documentary about Susan Oliver's life in 2014 was titled \"The Green Girl\". \n\nIn 1970, she appeared as Carole Carson/Alice Barnes on the TV Western \"The Men From Shiloh\" (rebranded name for \"The Virginian\") in the episode titled \"Hannah\".\n\nFrom 1975 to 1976, Oliver was a regular cast member of the TV soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". In 1976, she received her only Emmy Award nomination (for \"Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress\") in the three-hour-long, made-for-TV movie \"Amelia Earhart\", broadcast on October 15, 1976 on NBC-TV.\n\nIn addition to her scores of television appearances, Oliver also had roles in several theatrical features, including \"The Gene Krupa Story\" (1959), \"BUtterfield 8\" (1960), and \"The Caretakers\" (1963).\n\nBy the late 1970s with acting assignments coming less frequently, Oliver turned to directing. She was one of the original 19 women admitted to the American Film Institute's Directing Workshop for Women (DWW), and she left a \"good chunk of funding for the DWW.\" In 1977, she wrote and directed \"Cowboysan\", her AFI DWW short film that presents the fantasy scenario of a Japanese actor and actress playing leads in an American western. Oliver directed two TV episodes, the October 25, 1982, installment of \"M*A*S*H\" and the December 4, 1983, entry of one of its sequel series, \"Trapper John, M.D.\".\n\nIn Oliver's last fully active years, she also appeared in the February 21, 1985, episode of \"Magnum, P.I.\", two episodes of \"Murder, She Wrote\" (March 31 and December 1), the February 12, 1987, episode of \"Simon & Simon\", and the January 10, 1988, episode of the NBC domestic drama \"Our House\". She made her last onscreen appearance in the November 6, 1988, episode of the syndicated horror anthology \"Freddy's Nightmares\". During her career in Hollywood, Oliver appeared in more than 100 television programs.\n\nOliver experienced an event in February 1959 that underscored her later aviation accomplishments. She was a passenger aboard Pan Am Flight 115, a Boeing 707 on a transatlantic flight from Paris to New York City when it dropped from . It was February 3, 1959, the same day Buddy Holly died in an airplane crash. These events caused her to avoid flying for the next year, even turning down job offers (with the exception of auditioning for \"BUtterfield 8\") if they were so short notice she could only travel by air. She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.\n\nIn July 1964, Hal Fishman introduced her to personal flying when he took her on an evening flight over Los Angeles in a Cessna 172. The experience motivated her to return the next day to the Santa Monica Airport to begin training for a private pilot certificate. In 1966, while preparing for her own transatlantic flight, she was a passenger in a Piper J-3 Cub when the pilot ran into wires while \"show-boating\"; the airplane flipped and crashed. She and the pilot escaped injury.\n\nIn 1967, piloting her own Aero Commander 200, she became the fourth woman to fly a single-engined aircraft solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the second to do it from New York City. Although she was attempting to fly to Moscow, her odyssey ended in Denmark after the government of the Soviet Union denied her permission to enter its air space. She wrote about her aviation exploits and philosophy of life in an autobiography published in 1983.\n\nIn 1968, she was contacted by Learjet to see if she was interested in obtaining a type rating on one of their jets with the intent to set record flights for them. She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single- and multiengined land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.\n\nIn 1970, Oliver co-piloted a Piper Comanche to victory in the 2760-mile transcontinental race known as the \"Powder Puff Derby\", which resulted in her being named Pilot of the Year. The pilot was Margaret Mead (not the famous anthropologist), an experienced pilot who had flown in several derbies with different co-pilots. In 1972, her training for a glider rating was chronicled for an episode of the television series \"The American Sportsman\" and the segment aired in March 1973.\n\nAccording to the \"FAA Registry\", the glider rating was issued to Oliver on July 21, 1972. It was her last rating. The registry shows her to have earned commercial pilot ratings for airplane single-engined land, airplane multiengined land, instrument airplane, and private privileges for glider. Her last aviation medical examination was in May 1976; therefore, she could not legally pilot any aircraft except gliders after May 1978, marking the end of her piloting of powered aircraft.\n\nOliver was diagnosed with colorectal cancer that later metastasized to her lungs, and she died on May 10, 1990, at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Strom resigned from \"National Vanguard\" in July 2006, but rejoined in 2012.\n\nIn 2008, Strom pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to 23 months in prison, of which he served four months.\n\nKevin Alfred Strom was born in Anchorage, Alaska in 1956.\n\nAfter encouraging his hatred of communism, a high school teacher informed him about the John Birch Society where Strom reputedly first met members of the National Alliance led by the neo-nazi William Luther Pierce and abandoned the JBS because, he said, members of the society were forbidden to discuss race. Via Pierce, Strom learned of such notions as ZOG (the conspiracy theory alleging a Zionist Occupied Government in the United States), White supremacy and the Civil rights movement was degenerate. He began to work for Pierce after graduating from high school\n\nIn 1982, Strom became a member of the NA, a group described as antisemitic, racist, and neo-Nazi.\n\nIn 1991, he founded and frequently delivered the \"American Dissident Voices\" radio broadcasts which were produced and broadcast by the NA.\n\nIn 1995, he founded and edited \"Free Speech\" magazine, which was published by the Alliance as an adjunct to its radio program. In early 2002, shortly before his death from cancer on July 23, the Alliance's founder, William Luther Pierce, named Strom editor of \"National Vanguard\" magazine and media director for the Alliance. Pierce also named Strom editor of the Alliance's monthly \"Bulletin\".\n\nDuring the weekend of April 16–17, 2005, Strom and several others were expelled from the National Alliance because of a dispute with the new Alliance leader Erich Gliebe. The expelled former Alliance members, led by Strom, formed their own organization which they called National Vanguard. As he had previously done for the National Alliance, Strom now delivered weekly Internet radio broadcasts for National Vanguard and titled them \"American Dissident Voices\" but they were often delivered 1–3 weeks late. These broadcasts effectively ceased with his departure from National Vanguard.\n\nStrom was briefly the managing editor of \"The Truth at Last\" newspaper during 2005. Several sources have described this tabloid as being highly antisemitic and racist, because it often referred to Africans as an inferior race. Strom's boss at \"The Truth at Last\", Edward Fields, is a former Grand Dragon of the New Order Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nStrom was a close associate of University of Illinois Classics professor and nationalist writer Revilo P. Oliver, who has been described as \"one of America's most notorious fascists\" and, according to B'nai Brith Canada, was \"a long time proponent of antisemitism\". Strom was chosen by the Oliver estate to be the archivist and publisher of Oliver's papers after Oliver committed suicide in 1994. In 2002, Strom published Oliver's book, \"The Jewish Strategy\".\n\nStrom is a former broadcast engineer and holds amateur radio license WB4AIO. Between 1983 and 1991, a pirate radio station named Voice of Tomorrow operated on shortwave and mediumwave frequencies, and broadcast openly racist and neo-Nazi material. According to Strom's ex-wife, Kirsten Kaiser, Voice of Tomorrow was operated by Strom.\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Strom was arrested in Greene County, Virginia on charges of possession of child pornography and witness tampering. The Grand Jury later added the charges of receiving child pornography and of seeking to coerce a 10-year-old into a sexual relationship. At the October 2007 federal trial on charges of \"attempting to coerce a 10-year-old girl into a sexual relationship by sending her anonymous gifts, driving past her house and writing lyrics to love songs declaring his desire to marry her\", and of witness intimidation, Judge Norman K. Moon threw out both charges due to lack of evidence of actual solicitation of sex, but added that Strom, then in his early 50s, had engaged in questionable conduct.\n\nAt the plea hearing on January 14, 2008, Strom pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in exchange for the other charges to be dropped, and was held at Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail while awaiting sentencing. He was sentenced to 23 months in prison in April 2008. Strom told the court before being sentenced that he was \"not a pedophile\" and was \"in fact the precise opposite of what has been characterized in this case,\" saying he had been \"unwillingly\" possessing 10 images of child pornography and that those came from an online forum he had visited which had been \"flooded with spam,\" which included \"sleazy, tragic\" pictures of children that he deleted. The judge of the case responded: \"Mr. Strom, you pled guilty to charges that now you're saying you're innocent. I prefer people plead not guilty than put it on me.\". Strom also claimed he was a victim of domestic violence, which was confirmed by his alleged attacker. Strom was released from prison on September 3, 2008, at which point he resided in Earlysville, Virginia.\n\nKevin Strom announced the opening of the new National Alliance on December 28, 2013 and is continuing broadcasts of \"American Dissident Voices\" in the original format, from a compound under construction in Tennessee with a group of original followers of William Pierce.\n\nThe statement \"To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize\" is attributed to Strom, due its use in Strom's 1993 essay \"All America Must Know the Terror That is Upon Us\" in which he wrote: \"To determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is it that I am not permitted to criticize?\"\n\nThe remark is often misattributed to Voltaire, the French philosopher active during the Age of Enlightenment. The phrase is \"most often attributed\" to Strom, which in turn is itself used against those who use the phrase as a political attack in and of itself.\n\nStrom had three children with his first wife, Kirsten Kaiser. Since their marriage ended, Kaiser has spoken about her life with Strom in several interviews. She has also written a book, \"The Bondage of Self\", on her experiences with Strom and the National Alliance.\n\n"}
{"id": "1800539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800539", "title": "Paul Rübig", "text": "Paul Rübig\n\nPaul Rübig (born 6 May 1953) is an Austrian politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1996 until 2019. He is a member of the Austrian People's Party, part of the European People's Party.\n\nRübig became a Member of the European Parliament on 25 January 1996, and was re-elected in 1996, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. Hence, he was the longest-serving MEP from Austria. On 25 June 2013, Rübig was elected already for the second time in a European-wide vote as MEP of the Year for his outstanding commitment in the field of research and innovation.\n\nBorn in 1953, Rübig attended the polytechnic institute for farm machinery design in Steyr, graduating in 1972. After his military service, he studied business administration, marketing and industrial engineering at the University of Linz (1972–78). He completed his studies there with a doctorate at the Institute for Auditing, Trusteeship and Accountancy in 1984. At the same time, he worked as a lifeguard, glider and skiing instructor.\n\nHe started his business career already in 1972, working in the family forging company with various general management appointments until 1996. During the course of his business career he founded companies in France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1991, Rübig was selected as a candidate for the Austrian People's Party for the regional elections in Upper Austria. After having been elected, he instantly became Chairman of the then so-called EU Integration Committee. By facilitating the accession of Austria to the European Union in this period, he quickly gained significant expertise in EU related matters. After a very short period as MP, he became a Member of the European Parliament on 25 January 1996, at this time by decision of the Austrian Parliament. Since then, he was four times re-elected, namely in 1996, 1999, 2004 and 2009.\n\nConvinced about the benefits of a functioning social partnership in Austria, he held various positions within the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber. From 1991 to 1996 he was board member of the Upper Austria Business Promotion Institute, from 1996 to 2000 Vice-President of the Upper Austria Chamber of Commerce, and from 2000 to 2005 Industry Vice-Chairman of the federal organization of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nRübig served as member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, of the Committee on Budgetary Control and is a substitute member of the Committee on Budgets. As deputy chairman, he was a member of the Maghreb delegation, and furthermore active in the delegations to the EFTA countries and to the Arabic peninsula.\n\nAs one of the initiators of the \"WTO Steering Committee\", Rübig held the position of the EPP small businesses spokesperson. Furthermore, he is the Treasurer of the Austrian EPP delegation in the European Parliament, Chairman of the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) unit and chairman of the Paneuropean Working Group in the European Parliament\n\nRübig strongly advocated in the European Parliament the interests of about 20.8 million small and medium sized enterprises (SME) in Europe. They create 85 percent of all new jobs, employ two thirds of all employees and mainly contribute to innovation and growth. Overcoming the global economic crisis, requires in his view a reduction of costs for SME, in particular for startup companies, significantly less red-tape, innovative SME tax regimes and more focus on independent and entrepreneurial thinking in school education.\n\nIn order to better promote his political ideas in the public debate, Rübig founded in May 2012 together with the Danish MEP Bendt Bendtsen and the Bulgarian MEP Nadezhda Neynsky the business organization of the European People's Party, SME Europe. In February 2013, the General Assembly decided to choose Rübig as the Honorary President of the organization. Since 2003, he is also the President of SME Global. Furthermore, between 1999 and 2000 he was elected President of the SME Circle of the EPP Parliamentary Group, from 2000 to 2001 Co-President of the SME Union and from 2001 to 2003 he held this same position alone as its President.\n\nAs responsible rapporteur in the industry committee and one of the most active supporters of the citizens initiative Europeans for Fair Roaming it was Rübig, as the key actor, who enforced the roaming rules at European level. Against massive opposition of the telecom industry, following his initiative, the costs for cross-border mobile calls, text messaging and mobile data transfers were gradually reduced. From 1 July 2013 on, mobile communication providers are only allowed to charge consumers following maximum prices: 24 cents (active calls), 7 cents (passive calls), 8 cents (text messages) and 45 cents (1 MB data packet). These ceilings will be again reduced before the summer 2014. Regardless of a further reduction of these ceilings in summer 2014, Rübig pushes now for a general abolition of roaming charges before the elections to the European Parliament in May 2014. In the \"New York Times\" he called upon the responsible Commissioner Neelie Kroes for swift and concrete implementation plans.\n\nAs key politician at European level in the field of science, Rübig advocated for a significant increase of research funding. In the negotiations for Horizon 2020, which will follow the 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7), he supports the restructuring of the available sources towards more funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, he requests in the ongoing budget negotiations for the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) an increase of means for growth generating measures in education, science and research. According to him, ultimately it always have been technological innovations that have shaped the history of mankind. Hence, today's investments into research, shape Europe's destiny of tomorrow.\n\nAs member of the Budgetary Control Committee, Rübig stood for a responsible and efficient use of tax money. Instead of only one-sided increases of single budget items, he generally advocates to examine in detail the use of tax money on its efficacy, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness. Alone, if this is ensured, it is justified according to him to spend more money on single areas, otherwise we have to achieve more with less means.\n\nAs expert on energy policies in the European Parliament, Rübig worked on a fundamental rethink in the energy policy of the European Union. He demands an effective and lasting support of renewable energies, a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, as well as a significant increase of energy efficiency. According to him, reforms have to be designed in a way that energy prices remain affordable and that the population benefits from an increased security of supply. Instead of a system of sanctions, targeted incentives should motivate the population to actively engage in the transformation of energy policies. In contrary to many of his colleagues in the European Parliament, Rübig suggests not to support all forms of low carbon energies at the same level, but only the safest, most cost-efficient and cleanest energies. He justifies his refusal of dangerous nuclear energy with reference to the high security risks and the enormous costs in the life cycle of such a power plant (construction, operation, decommissioning, final storage).\n\nAs EPP spokesperson in the WTO steering committee of the European Parliament, Rübig advocated for a sustainable removal of global trade barriers. In his view, developing countries can only break out of the poverty trap by opening their economies to international trade and investments, whereas protectionist measures have the opposite effect. In this context, free-trade should be accompanied by measures to improve infrastructure, a better education system for young people, as well as a well-functioning administrative and judicial system. Furthermore, Rübig argues in favour of giving companies the possibility to actively participate in dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization, instead of only giving this possibility to national governments. Altogether, such a system would lead to a much higher degree of legal security in international trade. In the debate about the possible Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement with the United States, he supports the initiative due to the positive effects for the global economic development. In case of an agreement until 2015, he expects 400,000 new jobs and on average a financial relief of 545 Euro for each household every year.\n\nRübig regularly criticizes that the public debates in the member states do not pay sufficiently attention to issues debated at European Union level. Hence, he asks for a Europeanization of news coverage in national newspapers and broadcasts. Furthermore, he also supports cross-border media projects and often speaks in academic debates all over Europe. In this context, Rübig was invited amongst others by the renowned College of Europe (CoE) and the French École nationale d’administration (ENA) in order to give public lectures.\n\nAs a self declared expert in key issues about the internet, Rübing voted for restrictions of the net neutrality and is also jointly responsible for the legislative text. His opinion on this issue is mainly based on his thoughts that soon the internet will be overloaded, and emergency calls will be delayed due to increasing streaming traffic (like netflix etc.).\n\nSince Austria joined the European Union (1995), Rübig initiated the tradition of bringing the Peace Light of Bethlehem to Strasbourg to hand the flame over to the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the city itself.\n\n\nSince 1980, Rübig has been married and father of an adult daughter and son.\n\n\n\n"}

The center also includes TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and Mann's Chinese Theatre) and the Dolby Theatre (formerly known as the Kodak Theatre), home to the Academy Awards. The historic site was once the home of the famed Hollywood Hotel. Located in the heart of Hollywood, along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it is among the most visited tourist destinations in Los Angeles.\n\nThe complex sits just across Hollywood Blvd. from the El Capitan Theatre and offers views of the Hollywood Hills and Hollywood Sign to the north, Santa Monica Mountains to the west and downtown Los Angeles to the east. The centerpiece of the complex is a massive three-story courtyard inspired by the Babylon scene from the D.W. Griffith film \"Intolerance\". The developer of the shopping center built parts of the archway and two pillars with elephant sculptures on the capitals, just as seen in the film, to the same full scale. It gives visitors an idea of how large the original set must have been.\n\nThe center has over 70 shops and 25 restaurants. Major retail tenants that face Hollywood Boulevard include American Eagle Outfitters, Forever 21, and Sephora. The complex also houses a Lucky Strike Lanes bowling alley, a six-plex movie theater, and a nightclub. \nHollywood & Highland also houses of gathering spaces including the Grand Ballroom, used for the Oscars Governors Ball. Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck operates his regional headquarters out of the complex. The center also includes television broadcast facilities that in 2004 included the studios for the daily talk show \"On Air With Ryan Seacrest\". Currently, the studio is home to Revolt TV.\n\nThe 637-room Loews Hollywood Hotel is also part of the site. The Metro Red Line's subway station of the same name is beneath the structure. Also, Metro Local lines 212, 217, 222, 237, 656 and Metro Rapid 780 serve Hollywood & Highland.\n\nDeveloped by TrizecHahn and with funds from the Community Redevelopment Agency, Hollywood & Highland opened after three years of construction in November 2001 and is part of an overall effort to revitalize Hollywood Boulevard.\nThe project is an example of joint development, in which a public agency leases the right to develop a parcel in exchange for improvements to the property, in this case, an enhanced portal to the Hollywood/Highland Metro Red Line station and a 3,000 space underground parking lot. TrizecHahn leased of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority land for 55 years at a rate of $492,000 per year (with additional increases added every five years based on the Consumer Price Index) and four 11-year optional extensions.\n\nLeading up to the construction of the development the City of Los Angeles was persuaded, through its Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA), to contribute at least $90 million in 1998 toward the initial construction of Hollywood & Highland. This was in addition to the costs of constructing the Red Line subway station below the mall.\n\nTrizec Properties Inc. sold its interest in the development for over $200 million in 2004 to CIM Group. CIM rebranded Hollywood & Highland and repositioned the center with higher-end tenants. In 2005, the center underwent renovations to add additional features such as escalators leading visitors from Hollywood Boulevard directly to the third floor of the central courtyard, new signage, and new stores.\n\nIn 2019, Real estate investment firms DJM Capital Partners, Inc. and Gaw Capital partnered and purchase the mall for $325 Million. They announced plans for a major renovation. They announced they will rebrand and upgrade the retail and courtyard. The renovations are expected to begin work in 2020 and conclude by 2021.\n\nThe Hollywood & Highland complex opened in 2001 with a conditional use permit that enabled, among other things, for the complex to have special exemptions of Los Angeles billboard ordinances. Despite objections of some residents and neighbors, in 2002 this agreement was amended and extended for an additional 20 years. L.A. City Councilman Eric Garcetti, who then represented the Hollywood-area district and was elected mayor in 2013, supported extending this special permit.\n\nThe design of the center has been criticized. In 2007, \"Curbed L.A.\", an online magazine, named Hollywood & Highland the \"winner\" of their Ugliest Building in Los Angeles contest. In selecting Hollywood & Highland, they cited its aesthetics, pedestrian unfriendliness (including the lack of storefronts on the side facing Highland Ave.), confusing circulation, and \"mish-mash of architectural styles\".\n\nThe center played a significant role in attracting development to other parts of Hollywood Boulevard. The TV Guide Hollywood Center (formerly owned by CIM Group) across the street reconstructed the ground floor and has attracted new tenants such as American Apparel, Baja Fresh, Hooters, and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Other notable retail stores that have a presence on the Boulevard include clothier H&M and the Spanish retail chain Zara. In addition, several blocks further east on Vine Street, a W Hotel opened incorporating the existing Hollywood/Vine Metro Red Line station.\n\nThe sidewalk in front of Hollywood & Highland is considered a coveted location for recent additions to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As such is one of the few locations where the star memorials are \"doubled up\" rather than being placed linearly, in order for more stars to be accommodated in front of the center.\n\nIn February 2005, the Academy Awards statuettes were put on display for public viewing at Hollywood & Highland before the ceremony on March 5. Visitors could have a picture taken outside with a giant prop Oscar that was to be used on the red carpet and in the exhibit could learn about the history of the Academy Awards, see the statuettes that were to be presented, and even get their picture taken holding an actual Oscar statuette. It became extremely popular, so the Academy decided to continue it. The exhibit opened on February 9, 2006 and closed February 24, when the Oscars were removed and paraded down the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.\n\n"}
{"id": "1800557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800557", "title": "Seismic analysis", "text": "Seismic analysis\n\nSeismic analysis is a subset of structural analysis and is the calculation of the response of a building (or nonbuilding) structure to earthquakes. It is part of the process of structural design, earthquake engineering or structural assessment and retrofit (see structural engineering) in regions where earthquakes are prevalent.\n\nAs seen in the figure, a building has the potential to 'wave' back and forth during an earthquake (or even a severe wind storm). This is called the 'fundamental mode', and is the lowest frequency of building response. Most buildings, however, have higher modes of response, which are uniquely activated during earthquakes. The figure just shows the second mode, but there are higher 'shimmy' (abnormal vibration) modes. Nevertheless, the first and second modes tend to cause the most damage in most cases.\n\nThe earliest provisions for seismic resistance were the requirement to design for a lateral force equal to a proportion of the building weight (applied at each floor level). This approach was adopted in the appendix of the 1927 Uniform Building Code (UBC), which was used on the west coast of the United States. It later became clear that the dynamic properties of the structure affected the loads generated during an earthquake. In the Los Angeles County Building Code of 1943 a provision to vary the load based on the number of floor levels was adopted (based on research carried out at Caltech in collaboration with Stanford University and the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, which started in 1937). The concept of \"response spectra\" was developed in the 1930s, but it wasn't until 1952 that a joint committee of the San Francisco Section of the ASCE and the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California (SEAONC) proposed using the building period (the inverse of the frequency) to determine lateral forces.\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley was an early base for computer-based seismic analysis of structures, led by Professor Ray Clough (who coined the term finite element). Students included Ed Wilson, who went on to write the program SAP in 1970, an early \"finite element analysis\" program.\n\nEarthquake engineering has developed a lot since the early days, and some of the more complex designs now use special earthquake protective elements either just in the foundation (base isolation) or distributed throughout the structure. Analyzing these types of structures requires specialized explicit finite element computer code, which divides time into very small slices and models the actual physics, much like common video games often have \"physics engines\". Very large and complex buildings can be modeled in this way (such as the Osaka International Convention Center).\n\nStructural analysis methods can be divided into the following five categories.\n\nThis approach defines a series of forces acting on a building to represent the effect of earthquake ground motion, typically defined by a seismic design response spectrum. It assumes that the building responds in its fundamental mode. For this to be true, the building must be low-rise and must not twist significantly when the ground moves. The response is read from a design response spectrum, given the natural frequency of the building (either calculated or defined by the building code). The applicability of this method is extended in many building codes by applying factors to account for higher buildings with some higher modes, and for low levels of twisting. To account for effects due to \"yielding\" of the structure, many codes apply modification factors that reduce the design forces (e.g. force reduction factors).\n\nThis approach permits the multiple modes of response of a building to be taken into account (in the frequency domain). This is required in many building codes for all except very simple or very complex structures. The response of a structure can be defined as a combination of many special shapes (modes) that in a vibrating string correspond to the \"harmonics\". Computer analysis can be used to determine these modes for a structure. For each mode, a response is read from the design spectrum, based on the modal frequency and the modal mass, and they are then combined to provide an estimate of the total response of the structure. In this we have to calculate the magnitude of forces in all directions i.e. X, Y & Z and then see the effects on the building. Combination methods include the following:\n\nThe result of a response spectrum analysis using the response spectrum from a ground motion is typically different from that which would be calculated directly from a linear dynamic analysis using that ground motion directly, since phase information is lost in the process of generating the response spectrum.\n\nIn cases where structures are either too irregular, too tall or of significance to a community in disaster response, the response spectrum approach is no longer appropriate, and more complex analysis is often required, such as non-linear static analysis or dynamic analysis.\n\nStatic procedures are appropriate when higher mode effects are not significant. This is generally true for short, regular buildings. Therefore, for tall buildings, buildings with torsional irregularities, or non-orthogonal systems, a dynamic procedure is required. In the linear dynamic procedure, the building is modelled as a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system with a linear elastic stiffness matrix and an equivalent viscous damping matrix.\n\nThe seismic input is modelled using either modal spectral analysis or time history analysis but in both cases, the corresponding internal forces and displacements are determined using linear elastic analysis. The advantage of these linear dynamic procedures with respect to linear static procedures is that higher modes can be considered. However, they are based on linear elastic response and hence the applicability decreases with increasing nonlinear behaviour, which is approximated by global force reduction factors.\n\nIn linear dynamic analysis, the response of the structure to ground motion is calculated in the time domain, and all phase information is therefore maintained. Only linear properties are assumed. The analytical method can use modal decomposition as a means of reducing the degrees of freedom in the analysis.\n\nIn general, linear procedures are applicable when the structure is expected to remain nearly elastic for the level of ground motion or when the design results in nearly uniform distribution of nonlinear response throughout the structure. As the performance objective of the structure implies greater inelastic demands, the uncertainty with linear procedures increases to a point that requires a high level of conservatism in demand assumptions and acceptability criteria to avoid unintended performance. Therefore, procedures incorporating inelastic analysis can reduce the uncertainty and conservatism.\n\nThis approach is also known as \"pushover\" analysis. A pattern of forces is applied to a structural model that includes non-linear properties (such as steel yield), and the total force is plotted against a reference displacement to define a capacity curve. This can then be combined with a demand curve (typically in the form of an acceleration-displacement response spectrum (ADRS)). This essentially reduces the problem to a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system.\n\nNonlinear static procedures use equivalent SDOF structural models and represent seismic ground motion with response spectra. Story drifts and component actions are related subsequently to the global demand parameter by the pushover or capacity curves that are the basis of the non-linear static procedures.\n\nNonlinear dynamic analysis utilizes the combination of ground motion records with a detailed structural model, therefore is capable of producing results with relatively low uncertainty. In nonlinear dynamic analyses, the detailed structural model subjected to a ground-motion record produces estimates of component deformations for each degree of freedom in the model and the modal responses are combined using schemes such as the square-root-sum-of-squares.\n\nIn non-linear dynamic analysis, the non-linear properties of the structure are considered as part of a time domain analysis. This approach is the most rigorous, and is required by some building codes for buildings of unusual configuration or of special importance. However, the calculated response can be very sensitive to the characteristics of the individual ground motion used as seismic input; therefore, several analyses are required using different ground motion records to achieve a reliable estimation of the probabilistic distribution of structural response. Since the properties of the seismic response depend on the intensity, or severity, of the seismic shaking, a comprehensive assessment calls for numerous nonlinear dynamic analyses at various levels of intensity to represent different possible earthquake scenarios. This has led to the emergence of methods like the incremental dynamic analysis.\n\n"}

The ATU Index is the product of a series of revisions and expansions by an international group of scholars: Originally composed in German by Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne (1910); the index was translated into English, revised, and expanded by American folklorist Stith Thompson (1928, 1961); and later further revised and expanded by German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther (2004). The ATU Index, along with Thompson's \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" (1932) (with which it is used in tandem) is an essential tool for folklorists.\n\nIn \"The Folktale\", Thompson defines a \"tale type\" as follows:\n\nAntti Aarne was a student of Julius Krohn and his son Kaarle Krohn. Aarne developed the historic-geographic method of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for classifying folktales, first published in 1910 as \"Verzeichnis der Märchentypen\". The system was based on identifying motifs and the repeated narrative ideas that can be seen as the building-blocks of traditional narrative; its scope was European.\n\nThe American folklorist Stith Thompson revised Aarne's classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope, while also translating it from German into English. In doing so, he created the \"AT number system\" (also referred to as \"AaTh system\") which remained in use through the second half of the century. Another edition with further revisions by Thompson followed in 1961. According to D. L. Ashliman, \"The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales\".\n\nThe AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of \"The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography\" by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many \"irregular types\" are in fact old and widespread, and that \"emphasis on oral tradition\" often obscured \"older, written versions of the tale types\". To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification (ATU) system and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as \"smaller narrative forms\" in this expanded listing. He also put the emphasis of the collection more explicitly on international folktales, removing examples whose attestation was limited to one ethnic group.\n\nThe Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The name does not have to be strictly literal for every folktale. For example, \"The Cat as Helper\" (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance \"The Quest for a Lost Bride\" (400) or the \"Animal Bride\" (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: tale 510, \"Persecuted Heroine\" (renamed in Uther's revision as \"Cinderella and Peau d'Âne\"), has subtypes 510A, \"Cinderella\", and 510B, \"Catskin\" (renamed in Uther's revision as \"Peau d'Asne\"). \n\nAs an example, the entry for 510A in the ATU index (with cross-references to motifs in Thompson's \"Motif-Index of Folk Literature\" in square brackets, and variants in parentheses) reads:\n510A \"Cinderella\". (Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a supernatural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2].\nThe prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cinderella, who had first been hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her.\n\nCombinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 327A, 403, 480, 510B, and also 408, 409, 431, 450, 511, 511A, 707, and 923.\nRemarks: Documented by Basile, \"Pentamerone\" (I,6) in the 17th century.\nThe entry concludes, like others in the catalogue, with a long list of references to secondary literature on the tale, and variants of it.\n\nIn his essay \"The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique\", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the \"most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis\".\n\nThe tale type index was criticized by Vladimir Propp of the Formalist school of the 1920s for ignoring the of the motifs by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a \"macro-level\" analysis means that the stories that share motifs might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient. He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify \"Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf\" as an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.\n\nIn describing the motivation for his work, Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called \"The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples\". However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e. g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p. 198), \"they represent the keystones for the comparative method in folkloristics, a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics\" (p. 200).\n\nA quantitative study, published by folklorist Sara Graça da Silva and anthropologist Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the \"Tales of Magic\" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a phylogenetic model. They found four of them to belong to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stratum of magic tales:\n\n\nTen more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i. e. Balto-Slavic, Germanic and Italo-Celtic):\n\n\nHowever, the corpus of folktales and the method used by this study both imply that the results should be taken with caution.\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as both the 18th earl (in the 1st creation) and the 1st earl (in the 7th).\n\nJohn was Commendator of Dryburgh Abbey from 1547, and succeeded his father as 6th Lord Erskine in 1552. He joined the religious reformers, but was never very ardent in the cause. He did subscribe to the letter asking the Calvinist reformer John Knox to return to Scotland in 1557. The custody of Edinburgh Castle was in his hands during the struggle between the regent, Mary of Guise, and the Lords of the Congregation, during which he appears to have acted consistently in the interests of peace.\n\nWhen Mary, Queen of Scots, returned to Scotland in 1561 Lord Erskine was a member of her council and was in favor of her marriage with Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. His wife was Annabella Murray, daughter of William Murray of Tullibardine and sister of William Murray of Tullibardine, Comptroller of Scotland in 1563. She was a frequent companion of Queen Mary; John Knox called Annabella a \"verray Jesabell\". In 1565 Erskine was granted the earldom of Mar when the queen restored the charter to him and his heirs \"all and hail the said earldom of Mar.\" As guardian of James, afterwards King James VI, at Stirling Castle he prevented the young prince from falling into the hands of Lord Bothwell, and when the Scottish nobles rose against Mary and Bothwell, Mar was one of their leaders; he took part in the government of Scotland during Mary's imprisonment at Lochleven Castle in 1567–68 and also after her subsequent abdication.\n\nIn September 1571 he was chosen Regent of Scotland, but he was overshadowed and perhaps slighted by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. He died at Stirling on 29 October 1572 after a short illness, widely agreed to have been natural causes. However, some sources indicate that he may have been poisoned at the behest of the Earl of Morton. Mar's illness, wrote James Melville, followed a banquet at Dalkeith Palace given by Morton.\n\nJohn began building the house at Stirling called 'Mar's Wark', now a ruin under the care of Historic Scotland. The other seat of the family was Alloa Tower. James VI continued to regard Annabella Murray with affection and wrote to her as \"Minnie\".

The number of members varies from 6 to 11, but always includes a bass guitar player, a drummer, a guitarist and at least three lead singers. They are also known for bizarre song structures and topics, such as \"Donkey Call\" in which the singers proclaim they are giving up automobiles in favor of riding donkeys and encourage audience members to do the same and give their \"Donkey Call\" (or \"Esel Schrei\"), or loudly make the sound of a donkey.\n\nSoophie Nun Squad formed in the fall of 1992 as a four-piece called The Schwa Sound, but renamed themselves by February 1993 at news that friends Chip King (later of The Body) and Mark Lowe (later of Il Libretina) had started a band entitled \"Schwa\". Soophie Nun Squad's first show was April 24, 1993 on the back lawn of the Arkansas Governor's Mansion, at the request of Governor Jim Guy Tucker's daughter Anna. Initially, Soophie Nun Squad drew from such diverse musical influences as Moss Icon, Primus, Chino Horde, Anthrax, The Four Tops, Beastie Boys, and Heavenly. As new members joined the fray through the years, Soophie Nun Squad became a sonic melting pot, primarily influenced by Big Boys, Salt N Pepa, R. Kelly, Public Enemy, Laurie Anderson, Rites of Spring, David Bowie, and 69 Boyz, and became increasingly more focused on the relationship between their songs and performative narratives tying disparate movements into a larger body of music (reaching its zenith in \"The Scab Fairy\", a seven-part rock opera on 2003's \"Passion Slays the Dragon\"). \n\nSoophie Nun Squad has been inactive since performing on June 21, 2006 in Braunschweig, Germany. Some material and concepts for newer SNS songs found outlets in WAIT (consisting of Nate Powell, with contributions by Mark, Maralie, and Eli), Divorce Chord (Nate Powell, Mike Lierly, and Patrice Poor), Humanola (Eli Monster), and HoneyBeast (Maralie Armstrong). The band was scheduled to play their final concerts at a show for Towncraft (film) on May 18, 2007 and the following night in North Little Rock, AR, until Mark Lierly broke his wrists and the shows were cancelled.\n\nSoophie Nun Squad's tours are as follows:\n\nSoophie Nun Squad's members were scattered across the United States but remain tied to the Little Rock punk scene.

Band members have also lived in and participated in the scenes of Kansas City MO, Philadelphia PA, New York NY, and Savannah GA. \n\nDue to the intimacy of Soophie Nun Squad performances, critics and historians generally agree that the band could never be as successful in a large venue. Despite this, the band has gained a huge international cult following, due in part to extensive touring.\n\nSoophie (1993–2010), a Lhasa Apso owned by the drummer and one singer's family, is named after the band. \n\n\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as both the 19th earl (in the 1st creation) and the 2nd earl (in the 7th).\n\nJohn Erskine was born in 1558, though the precise date is unknown.\nTogether with King James VI of Scotland he was educated by George Buchanan. He succeeded to the earldom of Mar on the death of his father in 1572. After attaining his majority he was nominally the guardian of the young king, who was about seven years his junior, and who lived with him at Stirling; but he was in reality something of a puppet in the hands of the regent, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton; and he lost power and position when Morton was imprisoned.\n\nHe married his first wife, Anne Drummond (15551587) in October 1580. Anne was the daughter of Lord David Drummond (d. 1571) and Lilias Ruthven (d. 1579). Their marriage was cut short by Anne's early death in 1587, but the marriage did produce John's son and heir, John Erskine.\nHe was concerned in the seizure of James VI in 1582 (a plot known as the raid of Ruthven); but when James escaped from his new custodians the earl fled into the west of Scotland. Then leaving his hiding-place the Earl of Mar seized Stirling Castle, whereupon James marched against him, and he took refuge in England. Queen Elizabeth I interceded for him, but in vain. \n\nIn October 1584 James VI gave a gift of Mar's clothes to Thomas Stewart, a brother of Alexander Stewart of Garlies. The clothes included cloaks, doublets, breeches, and other items in cloth-of-silver, figured velvet, satin and other rich fabrics. They had been seized from a ship than ran aground near Whithorn.\n\nAfter some futile communications between the governments of England and Scotland the Earl of Mar and his friends gathered an army, entered the presence of the king at Stirling, and were soon in supreme authority (1585). The Earl of Mar was restored to his lands and titles. Henceforward he stood high in the royal favor; he became governor of Edinburgh Castle and was made tutor to James's son, Prince Henry. His great achievement was the recovery of the Mar estates, alienated by the Crown during the long period that his family had been out of possession, including Kildrummy, the seat of the earldom.\n\nIn December 1592 he married his second wife Marie Stewart, daughter of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox at Holyroodhouse. The marriage was intended to be held at Dalkeith Palace but was delayed by Mar's illness, the match was opposed by many because Mary was a Catholic. Their daughter, Lady Mary Erskine, married William Keith, 5th Earl Marischal.\n\nMar performed in the tournament at the baptism of Prince Henry dresseda as a \"Christian Knight\" in a team with the king and Sir Thomas Erskine. He was made keeper of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle in 1594. This led to disagreement with Anne of Denmark. In September 1595 she would not look at Mar when he was in the same room with her at Falkland Palace.\n\nIn 1601, the earl was sent as envoy to London; here Elizabeth I assured him that James should be her successor, and his mission was conducted with tact and prudence. Subsequently, Mar and the King continued a secret correspondence with Robert Cecil.\n\nWhile Mar was away Anne of Denmark came to Stirling Castle on 7 May 1603 to take away Prince Henry. The Countess, his wife Marie, refused to allow this. Mar made his apology for the events of the day to the queen on 5 July at Windsor Castle.\n\nAfter the Union of the Crowns, the earl joined the English privy council. He was granted several manors in England, including Hundon and Chipley in Suffolk, for which he was given £15,000 in 1611 when they were sold to William, Lord Cavendish. \n\nThe Earl of Mar was created Lord Cardross in 1610; he was a member of the Court of High Commission and was Lord High Treasurer of Scotland from 1615 to 1630.\n\nIn January 1608, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton wrote to Mar asking for the recipe that would restore his favour with Anne of Denmark. In 1621 King James requested fir tree seeds for the Marquis of Buckingham to plant at Burley on the Hill.\n\nThe depute-treasurer Gideon Murray died in 1621, and Mar wrote to King James in July assuring him that Murray's good management would continue, and that he himself had visited Linlithgow Palace to see the new north range being built.\n\nKing Charles sent a warrant in June 1625 for Mar and Archibald Napier, treasurer-depute, to appoint a \"skillfull and well experimented gardener in England\" to reside at Stirling Castle and repair the orchards.\n\nMar died at Stirling on 14 December 1634.\n\nFrom time to time James would lodge jewels with Mar for safety and as pledges for loans. In December 1601 Mar returned several pieces including a cross set seven diamonds and two rubies, a hat string with 89 diamonds, a \"feather\" jewel to wear in a hat in the shape of a capital letter \"A\" for Anne of Denmark made with 110 diamonds, and other pieces.\n\nJohn Erskine and Anne Drummod had a son:\nJohn Erskine and his second wife, Marie Stewart,had five sons, among them being James (died 1640), earl of Buchan; Henry, Master of Cardross and Commendator of Dryburgh (died 1628), whose son David succeeded to the barony of Cardross; and Charles, the ancestor of the earls of Rosslyn.\n\nIn November 1614 Viscount Fenton discussed the marriage of Mar's daughter Anna Erskine to a son of the Earl of Rothes, later John Leslie, 6th Earl of Rothes. Although Rothes was an ancient and noble house, Fenton would not have advised that Mar's eldest son's should marry a daughter of Katherine Drummond, the \"last Lady Rothes that was\".\n"}

Typically it specifies relations between kinds of things, but may also include relations with individual things. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context.\n\nThe term \"information model\" in general is used for models of individual things, such as facilities, buildings, process plants, etc. In those cases the concept is specialised to facility information model, building information model, plant information model, etc. Such an information model is an integration of a model of the facility with the data and documents about the facility.\n\nWithin the field of software engineering and data modeling an information model is usually an abstract, formal representation of entity types that may include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or occurrences, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system. Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations.\n\nAn information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models, irrespective of whether they are object models (e.g. using UML), entity relationship models or XML schemas.\n\nIn 1976, an entity-relationship (ER) graphic notation was introduced by Peter Chen. He stressed that it was a \"semantic\" modelling technique and independent of any database modelling techniques such as Hierarchical, CODASYL, Relational etc. Since then, languages for information models have continued to evolve. Some examples are the Integrated Definition Language 1 Extended (IDEF1X), the EXPRESS language and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\n\nResearch by contemporaries of Peter Chen such as J.R.Abrial (1974) and G.M Nijssen (1976) led to today's Fact Oriented Modeling (FOM) languages which are based on linguistic propositions rather than on \"entities\". FOM tools can be used to generate an ER model which means that the modeler can avoid the time-consuming and error prone practice of manual normalization. Object-Role Modeling language (ORM) and Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling (FCO-IM) are both research results, based upon earlier research.\n\nIn the 1980s there were several approaches to extend Chen’s Entity Relationship Model. Also important in this decade is REMORA by Colette Rolland.\n\nThe ICAM Definition (IDEF) Language was developed from the U.S. Air Force ICAM Program during the 1976 to 1982 timeframe. The objective of the ICAM Program, according to Lee (1999), was to increase manufacturing productivity through the systematic application of computer technology. IDEF includes three different modeling methods: IDEF0, IDEF1, and IDEF2 for producing a functional model, an information model, and a dynamic model respectively. IDEF1X is an extended version of IDEF1. The language is in the public domain. It is a graphical representation and is designed using the ER approach and the relational theory. It is used to represent the “real world” in terms of entities, attributes, and relationships between entities. Normalization is enforced by KEY Structures and KEY Migration. The language identifies property groupings (Aggregation) to form complete entity definitions.\n\nEXPRESS was created as ISO 10303-11 for formally specifying information requirements of product data model. It is part of a suite of standards informally known as the STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP). It was first introduced in the early 1990s. The language, according to Lee (1999), is a textual representation. In addition, a graphical subset of EXPRESS called EXPRESS-G is available. EXPRESS is based on programming languages and the O-O paradigm. A number of languages have contributed to EXPRESS. In particular, Ada, Algol, C, C++, Euler, Modula-2, Pascal, PL/1, and SQL. EXPRESS consists of language elements that allow an unambiguous object definition and specification of constraints on the objects defined. It uses SCHEMA declaration to provide partitioning and it supports specification of data properties, constraints, and operations.\n\nUML is a modeling language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts, rather than processes, of software systems. It was conceived originally by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson. UML was approved by the Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 1997. The language, according to Lee (1999), is non-proprietary and is available to the public. It is a graphical representation. The language is based on the objected-oriented paradigm. UML contains notations and rules and is designed to represent data requirements in terms of O-O diagrams. UML organizes a model in a number of views that present different aspects of a system. The contents of a view are described in diagrams that are graphs with model elements. A diagram contains model elements that represent common O-O concepts such as classes, objects, messages, and relationships among these concepts.\n\nIDEF1X, EXPRESS, and UML all can be used to create a conceptual model and, according to Lee (1999), each has its own characteristics. Although some may lead to a natural usage (e.g., implementation), one is not necessarily better than another. In practice, it may require more than one language to develop all information models when an application is complex. In fact, the modeling practice is often more important than the language chosen.\n\nInformation models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish. Gellish, which has natural language variants Gellish Formal English, Gellish Formal Dutch , etc. is an information representation language or modeling language that is defined in the Gellish smart Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has the form of a Taxonomy/Ontology. A Gellish Database is not only suitable to store information models, but also knowledge models, requirements models and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies. Information models in Gellish English use Gellish Formal English expressions. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as: \nwhereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows:\nSuch Gellish expressions use names of concepts (such as 'city') and relation types (such as <is located in> and <is classified as a>) that should be selected from the Gellish Formal English Dictionary-Taxonomy (or of your own domain dictionary). The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models, because the dictionary contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts, including more than 600 standard relation types. Thus, an information model in Gellish consists of a collection of Gellish expressions that use those phrases and dictionary concepts to express facts or make statements, queries and answers.\n\nThe Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) provides a standard set of information models for various enterprise domains under the general title of the Common Information Model (CIM). Specific information models are derived from CIM for particular management domains.\n\nThe TeleManagement Forum (TMF) has defined an advanced model for the Telecommunication domain (the Shared Information/Data model, or SID) as another. This includes views from the business, service and resource domains within the Telecommunication industry. The TMF has established a set of principles that an OSS integration should adopt, along with a set of models that provide standardized approaches.\n\nThe models interact with the information model (the Shared Information/Data Model, or SID), via a process model (the Business Process Framework (eTOM), or eTOM) and a life cycle model.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some important Baptist figures in the struggle were John Smyth, Thomas Helwys, Edward Wightman, Leonard Busher, Roger Williams (who was a Baptist for a short period but became a \"Seeker\"), John Clarke, Isaac Backus, and John Leland.\n\nIn 1612 John Smyth wrote, \"the magistrate is not by virtue of his office to meddle with religion, or matters of conscience\". That same year, Thomas Helwys wrote that the King of England could \"command what of man he will, and we are to obey it,\" but, concerning the church—\"with this Kingdom, our lord the King hath nothing to do.\" In 1614, Leonard Busher wrote what is believed to be the earliest Baptist treatise dealing exclusively with the subject of religious liberty.\n\nThe Danbury Baptist Association of Danbury, Connecticut sent a letter, dated October 7, 1801, to the newly elected President Thomas Jefferson, expressing concern over the lack in their state constitution of explicit protection of religious liberty, and against a government establishment of religion.\n\nIn their letter to the President, the Danbury Baptists affirmed that \"Our Sentiments are uniformly on the side of Religious Liberty\":\nAs a religious minority in Connecticut, the Danbury Baptists were concerned that a religious majority might \"reproach their chief Magistrate... because he will not, dare not assume the prerogatives of Jehovah and make Laws to govern the Kingdom of Christ,\" thus establishing a state religion at the cost of the liberties of religious minorities.\n\nThomas Jefferson's response, dated January 1, 1802, concurs with the Danbury Baptists' views on religious liberty, and the accompanying separation of civil government from concerns of religious doctrine and practice.\n\nThis doctrine, known as the \"wall of separation\" or \"strict separationism,\" would later become highly influential in 20th century Supreme Court understandings of the relationship between church and state. The phrase \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the United States Constitution, despite its wide use and origin from a founding father. The relevance of this reply is a subject of heated debate, with scholars such as Robert Boston emphasizing its importance, and others such as Mark David Hall arguing that the letter was a historical outlier.\n\nIn the U.S. today, a group of Baptists believe the United States was formed as a Christian nation by the Founding Fathers. There is neither a unifying nor a codified doctrinal position among American Baptists. Interpretations of the meaning of \"separation of church and state\" vary among different Baptist affiliations.\n\nHowever, many Baptists in the United States still believe in the wall of separation and support maintaining it. For example, fifteen Baptist organizations, representing collectively over 10 million Baptists in America, collaborate with one another to protect religious liberty and the separation of church and state through their funding of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. Freedom of conscience is a historic Baptist distinctive, and many Baptists continue to believe the best course for obtaining and securing freedom of conscience is through the separation of church and state.\n"}

A crooner, he found popular success, especially in the United Kingdom where he had five successive Top 10 albums in the 1960s as well as several hits on the UK Singles Chart, including \"If the Whole World Stopped Lovin'\", \"Walk Tall\" and \"Elusive Butterfly\". \"The Val Doonican Show\", which featured his singing and a variety of guests, had a long and successful run on BBC Television from 1965 to 1986 and Doonican won the Variety Club of Great Britain's BBC-TV Personality of the Year award three times.\n\nDoonican was born on 3 February 1927 in Waterford, Ireland, the youngest of the eight children of Agnes (née Kavanagh) and John Doonican. He was from a musical family and played in his school band from the age of six. In 1941 when he was a teenager his father died, so he had to leave De La Salle College Waterford, to get factory jobs fabricating steel and making orange and grapefruit boxes. He began to perform in his hometown, often with his friend Bruce Clarke, and they had their first professional engagement as a duo in 1947. Doonican appeared in a summer season at Courtown Harbour, County Wexford. He soon featured on Irish radio, sometimes with Clarke, and appeared in Waterford's first-ever television broadcast. Then he played the drums in a band on a tour through Ireland.\n\nIn 1951 Doonican moved to England to join the Four Ramblers, who toured and performed on BBC Radio shows broadcast from factories, and on the \"Riders of the Range\" serials. He also began performing at United States Air Force bases. The Ramblers supported Anthony Newley on tour and recognising his talent and potential as a solo act, Newley persuaded him to leave the singing group and go solo. He was auditioned for radio as a solo act, and appeared on the radio show \"Variety Bandbox\". Soon after his solo career started, he had his own radio show as well as performing in concerts and cabaret. In the late 1950s, Doonican became one of the artists managed by Eve Taylor, the self-described 'Queen Bee' of showbusiness, who remained his manager until her death.\n\nAfter seeing him in cabaret in London in 1963, impresario Val Parnell booked him to appear on \"Sunday Night at the Palladium\". As a result of his performance, Bill Cotton, then Assistant Head of Light Entertainment at BBC Television, offered Doonican his own regular show. The TV shows were produced by Yvonne Littlewood and lasted for over 20 years. At their peak the shows attracted audiences of some 19 million viewers. The shows featured his relaxed crooner style, sitting in a rocking chair wearing cardigans or jumpers, sometimes performing comedic Irish songs including \"Paddy McGinty's Goat\", \"Delaney's Donkey\" and \"O'Rafferty's Motor Car\" as well as easy listening and country material on which he accompanied himself on acoustic guitar. Doonican's songs about O'Rafferty were popular enough for the BBC to publish a book, \"Val Doonican Tells The Adventures of O'Rafferty\", which retold five of the tales, in 1969. As his were variety shows, his TV programmes gave a number of other performers, such as Dave Allen, early exposure. Regular guests included Bernard Cribbins, Bob Todd, the Norman Maen Dancers, the Mike Sammes Singers, and the Kenny Woodman Orchestra. At its height \"The Val Doonican Show\", which featured both American and British acts, had 20 million viewers. In the United States, \"The Val Doonican Show\" aired on ABC on Saturday evenings at 8:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. Central) from 5 June to 14 August 1971.\n\nThe Palladium performance also kick-started his recording career. Between 1964 and 1973 Doonican was rarely out of the UK Singles Chart, his greatest successes including the singles \"Walk Tall\", \"The Special Years\", \"Elusive Butterfly\", \"What Would I Be\", (on Decca) \"If The Whole World Stopped Loving\" (Pye), and \"Morning\" (Philips); and the albums \"13 Lucky Shades of Val Doonican\" (Decca), and \"Val Doonican Rocks, But Gently\" (Pye) which reached Number 1 in the UK Albums Chart in December 1967 and knocked the Beatles' \"Sgt Pepper\" off the top of the chart. The 1966 single release \"Elusive Butterfly\" reached a UK chart peak of #5 and #3 in Ireland. In all, he recorded over 50 albums. After a spell with Philips records in the seventies he also recorded for RCA. He also sang the theme song to the film \"Ring of Bright Water\".\n\nBehind the scenes, Doonican was described as \"a perfectionist who knew his limitations but always aimed to be 'the best Val Doonican possible.'\" He was sometimes compared to American singer Perry Como, though he claimed his main influence was Bing Crosby. He appeared in three Royal Variety Performances. On 31 December 1976, Doonican performed his hit song \"What Would I Be\" on BBC One's \"A Jubilee of Music\", celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II's impending Silver Jubilee.\n\nDoonican won the BBC Television Personality of the Year award in 1966. He was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1970. Eamonn Andrews met him at the 18th green of the South Herts Golf Club as Doonican played a round of golf. He wrote two volumes of autobiography, \"The Special Years\" (1980) and \"Walking Tall\" (1985)\n\nDoonican met his future wife, Lynette Rae, when both she and the Ramblers supported Anthony Newley on tour. The couple married in 1962. They had two daughters, Sarah and Fiona, and two grandchildren, Bethany and Scott. In later years they lived at Knotty Green in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Doonican officially retired in 1990 but was still performing in 2009. He had a second home in Spain and was a keen golfer and a talented watercolour painter. Another hobby he enjoyed was cooking. In June 2011, he was recognised by the Mayor of Waterford bestowing on him \"The Freedom of the City\".\n\nDoonican died at a nursing home in Buckinghamshire on 1 July 2015, aged 88. His daughter Sarah told \"The Guardian\": \"Until 87, he was as fit as a flea. It was just old age, I'm afraid — the batteries ran out.\" Leading tributes to Doonican, fellow entertainer Bruce Forsyth said, \"It is very sad. He was always a lovely man to work with ... He was a very warm person, and number one in his field. He brought a lovely warmth with his personality and was a very popular man.\" Elaine Paige commented on Twitter, \"Sad to hear of Val Doonican's passing ... RIP Val\", while BBC disc-jockey Tony Blackburn said \"So sad to hear that Val Doonican has passed away. He was a lovely man and a true professional who I worked with on several TV shows R.I.P.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800632", "title": "Manuel I of Trebizond", "text": "Manuel I of Trebizond\n\nManuel I Megas Komnenos (Greek: Μανουήλ Α΄ Μέγας Κομνηνός, \"Manouēl I Megas Komnēnos\") (died March 1263) was an Emperor of Trebizond, from 1238 until his death. He was the son of Emperor Alexios I and his wife, Theodora. At the time Manuel reigned, the Empire of Trebizond comprised a band of territory stretching along the southern coast of the Black Sea. Although Michael Panaretos, a 14th-century Trapezuntine chronicler, calls Manuel \"the greatest general and the most fortunate\" and states he ruled \"virtuously in the eyes of God\", the only event he documents for Manuel's reign is a catastrophic fire striking the city of Trebizond in January 1253. The major events of his reign are known from external sources, most important of which is the recovery of Sinope in 1254, which had been lost to the Sultanate of Rum forty years before.\n\nIn 1243, a Trapezuntine army is recorded as assisting the Seljuk Turks, along with a detachment from the Nicaean Empire, against the Mongols of Persia at the Battle of Köse Dağ. Despite this, the Seljuk forces were shattered, and both the Seljuks and their allies had to settle their own submission to the victorious Mongols. Manuel visited in person the court of the Great Khan Güyük as early as 1246; this was an important act, as Rustam Shukurov notes, for the personal visit of a vassal ruler to the Khan’s camp was regarded as an indispensable ceremony; it brought these persons into the \"family\" of the Great Khan. \"Seljuk Anatolia was under tight Mongol control,\" Shukurov writes. \"Any serious change in social and political life (including appointments to key offices) required Mongol approval and sanction, which was embodied, in particular, in \"yarlighs\".\"\n\nOn 24 June 1254, Manuel recaptured Sinope, and made Ghadras \"archon\" of the Black Sea port. Kurškanskis suggests that Manuel had obtained a \"yarligh\" prior to this attack, although he admits doing so would have been inconsistent with the practices of the Grand Komnenes. For the years Manuel held this port, the Seljuk Turks were landlocked, making Trebizond once again the major naval power in the Black Sea.\n\nShukurov argues with Kurškanskis that Manuel had been given a \"yarligh\" by the Ilkhanite Mongols to recover Sinope, and argues further that it was done to embarrass the Golden Horde, who were the masters of the Seljuk Turks; the governor of Sinope at the time Manuel captured the port was \"ra’is al-bahr\" Shuja al-Din 'Abd al-Rahman, the Seljuk naval commander-in-chief, who had taken part in the Seljuk embassy to Batu Khan, ruler of the Golden Horde in 1253, where he received Batu's \"yarligh\" investing him with the office of \"na'ib\". A few years later, in October 1256, one of the three brothers who inherited the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, Kaykaus II, was defeated by Baiju and fled to sanctuary in the Nicaean Empire, moving Anatolia from the sphere the Golden Horde controlled firmly into the Ilkhanite.\n\nManuel Megas Komnenos died in March 1263, having \"recommended and chosen\"—to use Panaretos' words—his oldest son Andronikos as his successor.\n\nIn 1253, Manuel sent envoys to King Louis IX of France, who was then at Sidon after his defeat at the Battle of Fariskur, seeking to marry a daughter of his house. \"The King had no French princesses with him on the crusade,\" writes William Miller, \"but recommended Manuel to make a matrimonial alliance with the Latin Empire of Constantinople, to which the aid of 'so great and rich a man' would be useful against Vatatzes, the Greek Emperor of Nicaea.\" Jean de Joinville testifies to Manuel's wealth, stating he sent Louis \"a present of various jewels, and also, among other things, some bows made of cornel-wood. The notches for the shafts were screwed into the bows, and when these shafts were loosed, you could see they were very sharp and well-made.\"\n\nAlthough Miller fails to offer a reason for Manuel's overtures to King Louis, two more recent writers have, and these are not exclusive. Kuršanskis has pointed out that the timing of the embassy would make sense if his first wife, a Trapezuntine noblewoman Anna Xylaloe, had died before that year and thought a matrimonial alliance with the French king was desirable; and after Louis sent his regrets, Manuel wed Irene Syrikaina. If this is correct, it provides a badly-needed anchor point in the chronology of Manuel's Life. The other possible reason was suggested by Rustam Shukurov: it is well known that Manuel's Mongol overlords were favorable towards Christianity, and perhaps Manuel was encouraged by this favor to seek a connection with the \"undisputed head of the crusader movement and indefatigable warrior against Islam.\"\n\nManuel's reign is notable for being the first Emperor of Trebizond to issue large numbers of coins. This is important for two reasons: the first is that issuing coins in a precious metal, such as silver or gold, is commonly considered a demonstration of sovereignty by a ruler; the second is that the volume of coins issued by a ruler is frequently used as an indicator of economic activity. Although some copper scyphates have been identified as coming from Andronikos I Gidos' mint, according to Otto Retowski over 200 types of silver aspers—the characteristic coin of the Empire—were struck then, more than any other ruler of Trebizond, in addition to other silver and bronze currency. (John II is a distant second, having struck around 138 types of aspers during his reign.) Trapezuntine coins circulated widely outside the empire, especially in Georgia. His coins became so common there that his name became the generic word in Georgian for money; \"kirmaneoul\" is derived from \"kuros' Manuel\" or \"Caesar Manuel\".\n\nThe cause of this sudden explosion in the volume of currency is not clearly known. Certainly not all of them came from Manuel's silversmiths. Both Wroth and Retowski identified a number of coins minted as imitations in Georgia to meet demand there. Michel Kuršanskis has suggested some of these types were struck during the reigns of Manuel's successors—Andronikos and George—because their Mongol overlords forbade them from minting silver coins in their own names. Nevertheless, this leaves the vast majority of the coins with his name on them as being struck during his reign.\n\nSome writers attribute this large number of aspers to a change in the route of the Silk Road during Manuel's reign. The destruction of Baghdad by Hulagu Khan in 1258 revived the trade route running north from Armenia and the upper Euphrates valley to Erzerum and then through the Zigana Pass to Trebizond, instead of to the Mediterranean. However, Anthony Bryer has pointed out the volume of trade carried on this route was minuscule, and taxes and duties extracted from the goods passing through Trebizond (known as the \"kommerkion\") would at most have been 30% of the Empire's total revenues in a busy year, and more often 6%. Another author has pointed out that the silver mines in the region of Gümüşhane were within the borders of the Empire of Trebizond during the 13th century, and could provide the raw material for these coins; but further investigation has shown that these silver mines were not heavily exploited before the 18th century. Kuršanskis has suggested that these coins represent the tribute extracted by the dominant Mongols of Persia, although this does not explain the care taken in minting all of these coins: most of this tribute would, following its delivery to the Mongol overlords, have been melted down and either used to produce other coins or jewelry.\n\nManuel rebuilt the Hagia Sophia monastery in Trebizond between 1250 and 1260. Eastmond describes Manuel's church as \"the finest surviving Byzantine imperial monument of its period.\" When Michael VIII Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 he unsuccessfully demanded that Manuel abandon his claim to the title of \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\", the one commonly used by the Byzantine Emperors.\n\nManuel was the second son of Alexios I, the first emperor of Trebizond; his older brother, John I Axouchos, was his predecessor as Emperor. During the Siege of Sinope, one of the sources states that Alexios has \"grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing\", so it is likely that Manuel was born before 1214.\n\nManuel had children by three different women; four of his children reigned after him. Older scholars, like Miller and Finlay, assumed all three women were his wives, but more recently Michel Kuršanskis has argued that only two were his wives, and that Rusudan of Georgia was simply his mistress.\n\nBy his first wife, Anna Xylaloe, a Trapezuntine noblewoman he had:\nBy Rusudan of Georgia, he had:\nBy his Irene Syrikaina, his last wife and another Trapezuntine noblewoman, he had four known children:\n\n\n"}

She was the younger sister of Iranian singer Hayedeh.\n\nEftekhar Dadehbala was born on November 16, 1946, in Tehran, Iran. She is the younger sister of Iranian singer Hayedeh. Mahasti started her career on the Persian traditional music radio program \"Gol hâ ye Rangârang\" ( \"Colorful Flowers\") in 1963, with the song \"Ân ke Delam Râ Borde Xodâyâ\" () composed and arranged by maestro Parviz Yahaghi with lyrics by Bijan Taraghi.\n\nIn the beginning, Mahasti's family was reluctant to allow her to pursue a career in entertainment because it was not an appreciated career for women in Iran at that time. However, Mahasti overcame this stigma providing Iran with a new image for women within the entertainment industry.\n\nMahasti created an image of a \"gentle-woman\" singer, a lady with great manners. Her enormous success in music opened the pathway for many other women, including her elder sister, Hayedeh, who started her work 5 years after Mahasti. The two sisters had tremendous contributions to improving the image of female singers in Iran and in transitioning the Iranian music from where it was to where it is now.\n\nMahasti's parents divorced and remarried to other people. When she wanted to pursue a career of singing her parents weren't happy because of society's look upon female singers at the time. Mahasti married Kouros Nazemiyan and gave birth to her only child, Sahar. Mahasti and her family lived in Abadan for several years, finally moving back to Tehran.\n\nHer marriage with Nazemiyan ultimately ended in divorce. Nazemiyan was executed by the Revolutionary Court of the new Islamic Republic shortly after the Islamic revolution. Several years later she remarried, to Bahram Sanandaji, owner of a shoe factory, however, their marriage was also dissolved. In 1978, before the revolution she emigrated to the United Kingdom, and then to the United States in 1981, where she lived thereafter.\n\nIn March 2007, Mahasti publicly announced that she had been battling colon cancer for four years. She hoped that her experience would raise awareness within the Iranian community regarding cancer and the significance of constant physical examinations. She was then living in Santa Rosa, California with her daughter, Sahar, her husband, Naser, and their two children, Natasha and Natalie, her only grandchildren. She died on June 25, 2007, aged 60, in Santa Rosa.\n\nMahasti was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California on June 29, 2007, the same cemetery where her sister Hayedeh was also buried. Her funeral was broadcast live on Persian Broadcasting Company Tapesh and was attended by many Persian celebrities and stars and other artists including the mayor of Beverly Hills Jimmy Delshad and designer Bijan Pakzad.\n\n\nAlso appeared on:\n\n\n"}

Later, he served as an ambassador during the 1990s and was a Vice President of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2010. After briefly serving as Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary in 2010, Schmitt was elected as President of Hungary in a 263 to 59 vote in the Parliament of Hungary. He was sworn in as President on 2010. On 2 April 2012, Schmitt announced to the Hungarian Parliament his resignation as President, following the outbreak of a controversy surrounding his 1992 doctoral dissertation.\n\nBorn on 13 May 1942 in Budapest to a middle-class family, he graduated from high school in 1960 and later studied domestic trade at Karl Marx University of Economics, from which he graduated in 1965.\n\nSchmitt started a successful fencing career in 1955 competing for MTK-VM. After winning two Hungarian Championship titles in individual competitions he participated as part of the Hungarian National Fencing Team 130 times between 1965 and 1977. He won the team épée gold medal at the 1968 and 1972 Summer Olympics. He also won team and individual World Championships in fencing, and collected several second and third-place finishes until his active career ended in 1977. He later became the Chief of Protocol of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and presided over the World Olympians Association between 1999 and 2007.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1989, Schmitt was the general secretary of the Hungarian Olympic Committee and under-secretary of sports between 1981 and 1990. In 1989 after the End of Communism in Hungary he became president of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. He later became a diplomat, serving as Hungary's ambassador to Spain (1993–1997) and Switzerland (1999–2002). While in Spain he was also accredited to Andorra from 1995.\n\nIn 2002 he ran for the position of mayor of Budapest, but his independent candidacy also supported by Fidesz was unsuccessful. In 2003, he became a deputy president of Fidesz. He led the party list of Fidesz in the 2009 European elections in Hungary and was elected as a Member of the European Parliament with the Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union, to the Bureau of the European People's Party and was vice-chair of the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education.\n\nSchmitt chaired the Delegation to the EU–Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee. On 2009 he was elected one of the 14 Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament. He became the Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary after the Hungarian parliamentary election in 2010.\n\nIn the 2010 Hungarian presidential election, Schmitt was elected President of Hungary by the National Assembly, for a term commencing on . He succeeded László Sólyom. He was elected with the support of the Fidesz and Christian Democratic People's (KDNP) parties, receiving 263 out of 322 votes. András Balogh of the Socialist Party received 59 votes.\n\nSchmitt had been the deputy president of Fidesz and the speaker of the Hungarian Parliament. From the first free elections in 1990, the nominating party has typically picked one of its high-ranking members for president: for example the SZDSZ nominated Árpád Göncz, who was a founding member of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). The previous MSZP government's nominee was Katalin Szili, an MSZP member who was the then speaker of the Hungarian Parliament. Schmitt signaled a positive relationship with the Fidesz-KDNP government, saying: \"In the current situation, when we undertake rebuilding the country economically, socially and morally, it is imperative that the president get along with the prime minister, as well as all leaders and government members.\" Schmitt said he did not intend to take an obstructionist stance towards the government, and sought a more active role in the political process such as the drafting of the country's new constitution. After taking office, Schmitt resigned all posts and offices previously held. Soon after his election Schmitt came under heavy attack from some opposition parties, that refused to attend the presidential inauguration, citing high costs and a late invitation.\n\nDrafting of a new constitution began in 2010, and was finalized by 11 April 2011, being adopted by Parliament on 18 April. Schmitt signed the new constitution into law on 25 April and it went into effect on 1 January 2012.\n\nAs a supporter of the second cabinet of Viktor Orbán, already it was probable before his appointment that the presidential position is his reversioner. This confirmed that he proclaimed it at the time of the starting of his presidential activity, he wants to be \"man of the people\", and would like to favour and help the current government's work.\n\nHe created a sensation by personally identifying himself with the government's politics repeatedly in an interview with \"Time\" on 15 October 2010. In particular, the subject of the last sentence was \"we, the government.\" The interview in its entirety can be found on the website of the Office of the President.\n\nIn November 2010, during a presidential speech he declared one of his major goals to be the preservation and fostering of the Hungarian language and stressed that this would be made compulsory by law. However, after this speech the website of the Office of the President published statements that were full of grammatical and stylistic errors and were ridiculed by the general public.\n\nBy 31 December 2010, Schmitt had signed nearly one hundred bills which had been voted on by the National Assembly; he did not send any none back for consideration by the parliament, nor submit any to the Constitutional Court for judicial review.\n\nIn 1992 Pál Schmitt defended his dissertation for a doctor of philosophy degree \"summa cum laude\" at the \"Testnevelési Egyetem\" (University of Physical Education). In the year 2000, this institution was merged into Budapest's Semmelweis University to become one of its Faculties.\nOn 11 January 2012, the website of the Hungarian magazine HVG accused Schmitt of plagiarizing the work of a Bulgarian sport expert in his doctoral dissertation. Nikolay Georgiev's \"Analyse du programme olympique (des Jeux d’Olympiade)\" had been finished in 1987, and Schmitt's dissertation, completed in 1992, appears to be almost entirely a translation of this work. The accusation was denied by the Office of the President, which explained that Schmitt and Georgiev were friends and had worked together, from the same sources. \nAdditional plagiarized sources, including 17 pages written by the German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann, were identified later. Semmelweis University announced that a fact-finding committee would investigate the matter. \nThe fact-finding committee's report, issued on 27 March, confirmed the plagiarism (word-by-word translations of \"unusually large extent\"), but blamed the \"Testnevelési Egyetem\" for not revealing the copied sources, and fell short of putting any blame on Schmitt (\"the author may have thought that his dissertation satisfied the requirements\"). However, a minority report was issued by the single non-faculty member of the committee, which called for the revocation of Schmitt's doctoral degree. On 29 March 2012 the Senate of Semmelweis University decided to revoke the degree.\n\nOn 2 April 2012 Schmitt announced his resignation as President, saying that he felt the plagiarism debate had divided the country. He reiterated that his conscience was clear, vowed that he would complete a PhD program, and threatened to launch a lawsuit against Semmelweis University. On 15 May 2013, Schmitt formally surrendered his doctorate after an academic remedy committee declared that his thesis did not meet the criteria, either in terms of content or formal requirements.\n\nOn 22 March 2014, Schmitt said in a short interview that he had given up his plans for graduating as a PhD, but instead would write a monograph on the effects of sports on the environment and sustainable development, which would have been the theme of the promised degree thesis.\n\nIn January 2016, Schmitt was appointed Chairman of the Budapest 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games Bid Committee. Schmitt said \"as Guardians of the Bid, it is our role to ensure that Budapest 2024 truly reflects our collective commitment to the values of Olympism\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1800648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800648", "title": "Media ethics", "text": "Media ethics\n\nMedia ethics is the best division of applied ethics dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of media, including broadcast media, film, theatre, the arts, print media and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from war journalism to Benetton ad campaigns.\n\nMedia ethics promotes and defends values such as a universal respect for life and the rule of law and legality. Media Ethics defines and deals with ethical questions about how media should use texts and pictures provided by the citizens.\n\nLiterature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.\n\nResearch and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s. Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), Rafael Capurro, Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article \"\"“Ethics in Information Science”\" , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc.).\n\nIn the 1990s, the term \"information ethics\" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's \"The Principles of Information Ethics\" and Marsha Cook Woodbury's \"Computer and Information Ethics\", and Deborah G. Johnson's \"Computer Ethics\" were published.\n\nMedia ethics: Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular journalism ethics and standards and marketing ethics; also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as impartiality, objectivity, balance, bias, privacy, and the public interest. More generally, it also includes stereotyping, taste and decency, obscenity, freedom of speech, advertising practices such as product placement, and legal issues such as defamation. On an institutional level it includes debates over media ownership and control, commercialization, accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. censorship) and deregulation.\n\nThe ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in\nschools of journalism. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas. Topics covered by journalism ethics include:\n\nThe Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists utilizing online resources.\n\nWhile some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.\n\nSome of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include the issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.\n\nIssues in the ethics of entertainment media include:\n\nIn democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be constitutionally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.\nModern democratic government subsists in representation of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be accountable, and for the process of government to be transparent, effective communication paths must exist to their constituents. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if press freedom disappeared, so would most political accountability.\nIn this area, media ethics merges with issues of civil rights and politics. Issues include: \nSee: freedom of information, media transparency Right to Information.\nL Mera\n\nMedia integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the public interest and democratic process, making it resilient to institutional corruption within the media system, economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: \n\nThe concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of South East Europe, within the project South East European Media Observatory, gathering organisations which are part of the South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM).\n\nDigital news media includes online journalism, blogging, digital photojournalism, citizen journalism and social media. It talks about how journalism should interact and use the 'new media' to publish stories including how to use texts and images provided by other people. \n\nThere are new ethical issues due to the new image technology. Citizens now have the availability to take pictures and videos from easier and faster ways like smartphones which allow them to not only collect information but also edit and manipulate it.\n\nThis convergence of ease of capture, ease of transmission, and ease of manipulation questions the traditional principles of photojournalism which were developed for non-digital capture and transmission of pictures and video.\n\nThe main issues regarding the new image technology is that the newsroom cannot trust the easily obtained images and also the limit of the image edit. It is vague and very difficult to decide the borderline of image manipulation.\n\nIt is very complicated and still a dilemma to clarify the principles of responsible image making and ethics on it.\n\nWithin the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.\n\nOne of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another. Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.\n\nThe ethical facet of the global information society has been on the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress. The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society. The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.\n\nIn 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the first international symposium on information ethics in Karlsuhe, Germany. Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, information science, media studies, and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.\n\nMedia economics where things such as -- deregulation of media, concentration of media ownership, FCC regulations in the U.S, media trade unions and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, citizen media (low power FM, community radio) -- have ethical implications...\n\nThe media has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. Truth telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of truth telling is considered deception. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.\n\nIf values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:\n\nOne theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of applied ethics, differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are medical ethics and business ethics. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?\n\nPrivacy and honesty are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is\nthe principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been\ncovered extensively in business ethics (as well as medical and environmental ethics).\n\nThe issues of freedom of speech and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.\n\nA theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of \"observer\" and \"observed\". The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of legal ethics.\n\nA further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. Benetton advertisements and Turner prize candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own\nquestioner.\n\nAnother characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

All settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.\n\nIts name came from the Serbian word \"žaba\"/жаба (\"frog\" in English). In Serbian, the town is known as \"Žabalj\" (Жабаљ), in Hungarian as \"Zsablya\" or \"Józseffalva\" (between 1886 and 1919), in German as \"Josefdorf\", and in Croatian as \"Žabalj\".\n\nŽabalj was first mentioned in 1514 as \"Zeble\", a fortress captured by György Dózsa.

The theater and adjacent Hollywood Masonic Temple (now known as the El Capitan Entertainment Centre) is owned by The Walt Disney Company and serves as the venue for a majority of the Walt Disney Studios' film premieres.\n\nIn the early 1920s, real estate developer Charles E. Toberman (the \"Father of Hollywood\") envisioned a thriving Hollywood theater district. Toberman was involved in 36 projects while building the Max Factor Building (now the Hollywood Museum), Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Masonic Temple. With Sid Grauman, he opened the three themed theaters: Egyptian (1922), El Capitan (1926), and Chinese (1927).\n\nEl Capitan, dubbed \"Hollywood's First Home of Spoken Drama,\" opened as a legitimate theater on May 3, 1926, with \"Charlot's Revue\" starring Gertrude Lawrence and Jack Buchanan. Barker Bros. Furniture Emporium took up the rest of the building in the 1920s.\n\nFor a decade, it presented live plays, with over 120 productions including such legends as Clark Gable and Joan Fontaine. By the late 1930s, El Capitan felt the economic effects of the Depression, showcasing fewer and fewer productions. This period saw a cycle of experimentation with entertainment. In an effort to boost attendance at the theater, its management attempted to lure revues, road shows and benefits.\n\nDespite these efforts, business was faltering, and the theater then began showing movies. When Orson Welles was unable to locate a theater owner willing to risk screening \"Citizen Kane\", he turned to the El Capitan, and in 1941, \"Citizen Kane\" had its world premiere there. The theater then closed for one year as Paramount Pictures purchased the theater.\n\nThe building was remodeled in the modern style, with the decor covered with curtains and removing the box-seat balconies. The theater reopened in 1942 as the Hollywood Paramount Theater. Its inaugural film presentation was Cecil B. DeMille's feature \"Reap the Wild Wind\".\n\nThe theater remained the West Coast flagship for Paramount Pictures until the studio was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the antitrust case \"U.S. vs. Paramount Pictures, et al.\" to divest itself of its theater holdings. After this, the Hollywood Paramount was operated by United Paramount Theatres for some years, then by a series of other companies, culminating with ownership by the Pacific Theatres Circuit in the 1980s.\n\nAfter a 50-year stay, Barker Bros. Furniture closed its location in the building in the 1970s. In 1985, Pacific Theatres purchased the theater from SRO Theaters. The building's owners, Nick Olaerts and Thomas L. Harnsberger, had assigned authority for the theater's facade to the Los Angeles Conservancy in exchange for historical building tax credits.\n\nLate in the 1980s, Disney purchased a controlling stake in one of Pacific Theatres' chains, leading to Disney's Buena Vista Theaters and Pacific renovating the El Capitan Theatre and the Crest by 1989. These theaters became Disney's flagship houses. They spent $14 million on a complete renovation of the Paramount, restoring much of the building's original decor as well as the theater's original name. El Capitan reopened in 1991 with the premiere of \"The Rocketeer\".\n\nIn 1990, the city of Los Angeles designated El Capitan as a Cultural Heritage Monument. The 1992 National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation was bestowed on the restorers of the theater. A Michael Jackson mural was approved by the National Park Service to be placed on the side of the building in December 1992.\n\nAfter the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the building's frame was compromised and the theater had been flooded by its sprinklers and was considered uninhabitable by building inspectors. The owner walked away from the theater leaving the building to its mortgage company, CUNA Mutual Group. CUNA Mutual, having Disney as a continuing tenant, not only refurbished the theater but the office floors above for $10 million. In July 1995, Buena Vista purchased the Lanterman organ from Glendale City Redevelopment Agency.\n\nFrom the November 18, 1995, \"Toy Story\" premiere to January 1, 1996, Disney rented the Masonic Convention Hall, the next-door building, for Totally Toy Story, an instant theme park and a promotional event for the movie. In July 1998, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution purchased the convention hall to continue using it as a promotional venue. A Disney Store location opened next to the theater in the El Capitan Building in 1998.\n\nThe $3 million seismic retrofitting was finished in time for the June 21, 1996, premiere of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". The building's full restoration was completed in December 1997, which included the sign tower. The Hollywood Entertainment District, a self-taxing business improvement district, was formed for the properties from La Brea Avenue to McCadden Place on Hollywood Boulevard. The office space's first tenants were TrizecHahn Centers, builders of the 425,000-square-foot development on the other side of the boulevard. In conjunction with the \"\" premiere on June 22, 2005, the Disney's Soda Fountain and Studio Store opened up in the El Capitan Building on the ground floor replacing a Disney Store.\n\nCUNA Mutual having leased the building to full capacity placed the building up for sale in 2008 at a price of $31 million. In November 2013, Ghirardelli Soda Fountain and Chocolate Shop co-located with the Disney Studio Store next to the theater in the El Capitan building.\n\nThe theater is built into a six-story office building built in the 1920s. The design featured an exterior done in California Churrigueresque style of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture exterior designed by Stiles O. Clements of the architectural firm of Morgan, Walls & Clements, and mixed interior by G. Albert Lansburgh. The interior is a lavish East Indian in the main auditorium, English Tudor in the wood-paneled lower lobby and Italian Baroque on the facade.\n\nThe refurbished theater features a large Wurlitzer theatre organ originally installed in San Francisco's Fox Theatre in 1929. Below the theater is a small exhibit space, often used to display props from the films, such as costumes or set pieces. Next door is the adjacent Disney's Soda Fountain and Studio Store, where patrons can purchase ice cream themed to the film currently playing in the cinema next door. A wide variety of Disney and movie merchandise is available there.\n\n\n\n"}

EPC can be used to configure enterprise resource planning execution, and for business process improvement. It can be used to control an autonomous workflow instance in work sharing.\n\nThe event-driven process chain method was developed within the framework of Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) by August-Wilhelm Scheer at the Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik, Universität des Saarlandes (Institute for Business Information Systems at the University of Saarland) in the early 1990s.\n\nBusinesses use event-driven process chain diagrams to lay out business process workflows, originally in conjunction with SAP R/3 modeling, but now more widely. It is used by many companies for modeling, analyzing, and redesigning business processes. The event-driven process chain method was developed within the framework of Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS). As such it forms the core technique for modeling in ARIS, which serves to link the different views in the so-called control view. To quote from a 2006 publication on event-driven process chains: \n\nThe statement that event-driven process chains are ordered graphs is also found in other directed graphs for which no explicit node ordering is provided. No restrictions actually appear to exist on the possible structure of EPCs, but nontrivial structures involving parallelism have ill-defined execution semantics; in this respect they resemble UML activity diagrams.\n\nSeveral scientific articles are devoted to providing well-defined execution semantics for general event-driven process chains. One particular issue is that EPCs require non-local semantics, i.e., the execution behavior of a particular node within an EPC may depend on the state of other parts of the EPC, arbitrarily far away.\n\nIn the following the elements used in event-driven process chain diagram will be described:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the example, a customer order received is the initial event which creates a requirement capture within the company. In order to specify this function, sales is responsible for marketing, currency etc. As a result, event 'requirement captured' leads to another new function: check material on stock, in order to manufacture the productions.\n\nAll input or output data about material remains in the information resource. After checking material, two events may happen-with or without material on stock. If positive, get material from stock; if not, order material from suppliers. Since the two situations cannot happen at the same time, XOR is the proper connector to link them together.\n\nAlthough a real process may include a series of stages until it is finished eventually, the main activities remain similar. An event triggers one function; and a function will lead to one event. Meanwhile, an event may involve one or more processes to fulfill but a process is unique for one event, the same goes for process and process path.\n\nAs for the function, its data may be included in one or more information resources, while organization unit is only responsible for one specific function.\n\n\n"}

She is the wife of Friedrich (Frederick) Perls, also a renowned psychotherapist and psychiatrist.\n\nPosner was born to a wealthy family in 1905. By the age of five, she was taught how to play piano and demonstrated professional mastery when she was 18. Later, music and dance would be integrated into her therapy. She became interested in psychology when she was 16 (Fadiman & Frager, 2002). Like many before and after her, her interest began after reading Freud's 1899 \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (Fadiman & Frager, 2002). When she became a psychoanalyst, she was already prepared to pursue a career as a pianist, attended law school, and completed a degree in Gestalt psychology. She also obtained a doctorate in science from Frankfurt University in Germany.\n\nIn 1930 she married Friedrich (Frederick) Perls. They had met while working at the Frankfurt Psychological Institute. The couple had four children, including daughter Renate Perls and Stephen Perls, who is also a psychologist.\n\nIn 1933 the Perls had to flee Germany during the rise of Nazism. They then spent ten years in South Africa. It was there that the Perls wrote their first book together, \"Ego, Hunger and Aggression\", published in 1942. This work held the beginnings for their new theory of psychotherapy, Gestalt Therapy, which consisted of facing the client to notice his or her postures and gestures (Fadiman & Frager, 2002). The Perls also established the South African Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1935 and, worked for the South African army in the war against the Nazis.\n\nIn 1951, having moved to New York, the Perls, together with Paul Goodman and Ralph Hefferline published \"Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality\". By 1952, with the help of Paul Goodman, they had established The New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy (Fadiman & Frager, 2002). Perls ran the institute for almost 40 years, long after her husband's death.\n\nWhen Frederick Perls started travelling more often to the Esalen Institute in California in the early 1960s, Laura stayed on in New York to continue running the original institute.\n\nLaura Perls died in 1990 due to complications with her thyroid, one month before her 85th birthday.\n\n"}

Although it does not have the chess motif of the original \"\", it retains the central concepts of good vs. evil, one-on-one combat, magic, and power points.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"\", \"Adept\" is a struggle between two opposing sides (led by the followers of the Master of Order and of the Mistress of Chaos) that takes place on a game board, complete with playing pieces, but instead of capturing, pieces enter a battle screen and duel to the death. The board is a rectangle with four roughly concentric bands, corresponding to the four elements of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. Two non-elemental squares along the vertical center are \"Void.\" Two decorative citadel squares pad the horizontal center. Each player starts with four wizards called \"Adepts\" that can cast spells, in particular a summoning spell used to bring the other pieces into play.\n\n\"Order\" (yellow) and \"Chaos\" (blue) alternate turns. On a turn, a player must either move a piece or use an Adept to cast a spell. Summoned pieces can move any distance in their element, or move one square out of their element. Adepts teleport anywhere. Pieces may not enter occupied squares except as an attempt to eliminate an opponent's piece. Battles are resolved immediately, and the defeated piece is removed from the board. The turn then ends.\n\nThe game's sole resource is magical energy, used for spellcasting, paying a per-turn upkeep cost for each summoned piece, and the Adepts' teleportation. It's gained by having friendly pieces occupying squares with power points. Four power points are on the outer edges of one element at a time, moving inwards after every pair of turns. Two power points with lower income rates are on the Void squares. The starting side can be chosen or randomized. The side that goes second receives more magical energy. Spellcasting costs magic points in varying amounts, depending on the spell (e.g., summoning a demon requires more magic than summoning an elemental).\n\n\"II Computing\" stated that the Apple II version of \"Archon II\" \"is even more challenging than its predecessor, and features exciting innovations\", and concluded \"it's good to see a sequel to a successful game that is not as good as the first but extends the boundaries of the game's system\". Reviewing the Amiga version, \"Computer Gaming World\" \"recommend both \"Archon\" and \"Adept\"\" for those interested in challenging strategy games.\n\n\n"}

The IBM System/370 could be considered the first simple 128-bit computer, as it used 128-bit floating-point registers. Most modern CPUs feature single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instruction sets (Streaming SIMD Extensions, AltiVec etc.) where 128-bit vector registers are used to store several smaller numbers, such as four 32-bit floating-point numbers. A single instruction can then operate on all these values in parallel. However, these processors do not operate on individual numbers that are 128 binary digits in length; only their registers have the size of 128 bits.\n\nThe DEC VAX supported operations on 128-bit integer ('O' or octaword) and 128-bit floating-point ('H-float' or HFLOAT) datatypes. Support for such operations was an upgrade option rather than being a standard feature. Since the VAX's registers were 32 bits wide, a 128-bit operation used four consecutive registers or four longwords in memory.\n\nThe ICL 2900 Series provided a 128-bit accumulator, and its instruction set included 128-bit floating-point and packed decimal arithmetic.\n\nIn the same way that compilers emulate e.g. 64-bit integer arithmetic on architectures with register sizes less than 64 bits, some compilers also support 128-bit integer arithmetic. For example, the GCC C compiler 4.6 and later has a 128-bit integer type codice_1 for some architectures. GCC and compatible compilers signal the presence of 128-bit arithmetic when the macro __SIZEOF_INT128__ is defined. For the C programming language, 128-bit support is optional, e.g. via the codice_2 type, or it can be implemented by a compiler-specific extension.\n\nA 128-bit register can store 2 (over 3.40 × 10) different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 128 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455 (2 − 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and −170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728 (−2) through 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727 (2 − 1) for representation as two's complement.\n\n\nA 128-bit multicomparator was described by researchers in 1976.\n\nA CPU with 128-bit multimedia extensions was designed by researchers in 1999.\n"}

{"id": "1800731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800731", "title": "Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant", "text": "Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant\n\nThe Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (CCNPP) is a nuclear power plant located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland in the Mid-Atlantic United States. It is the only nuclear power plant in the state of Maryland.\n\nThe plant, owned and operated by CENG, a joint venture between Exelon and Électricité de France, has two 2737 megawatt thermal (MWth) Combustion Engineering Generation II two-loop pressurized water reactors. Each generating plant (CCNPP 1&2) produces approximately 850 megawatt electrical (MWe) net or 900 MWe gross. Each plant's electrical load consumes approximately 50 MWe. These are saturated steam plants (non-superheated) and are approximately 33% efficient (ratio of 900 MWe gross/2700 MWth core). Only the exhaust of the single high-pressure main turbine is slightly superheated by a two-stage reheater before delivering the superheated steam in parallel to the three low-pressure turbines. Unit 1 uses a General Electric–designed main turbine and generator, while Unit 2 uses a Westinghouse–designed main turbine and generator. The heat produced by the reactor is returned to the bay, which operates as a cooling heat-sink for the plant.\n\nUnit 1 went into commercial service in 1975 and Unit 2 in 1977. The total cost of the two units was approximately US$766 million.\n\nUnit 1 had its two steam generators replaced in 2002 and its reactor vessel closure head replaced in 2006, while unit 2 had its two steam generators replaced in 2003, and its vessel closure head replaced in 2007.\n\nThe water around the plant (see lower-right-center of photograph) is a very popular place for anglers. Unit 1 & 2 each takes in bay water (from the fenced-in area) to cool its steam driven turbine condensers plus other bay-water–cooled primary and secondary system heat exchangers. The bay water is pumped out at a nominal flow rate of 1.2 million gallons per minute (75,000 L/s) per unit (Unit 1 and 2) for each steam turbine condenser. The water is returned to the bay no more than 12 °F (6.7 °C) warmer than the bay water. Unlike many other nuclear power plants, Calvert Cliffs did not have to utilize water cooling towers to return the hot water to its original temperature. As the water comes out very quickly and creates a sort of artificial rip current, it can be a dangerous place to fish.\nCCNPP 3 will only need about 10% of the bay cooling water volume needed for Unit 1 and 2 combined. The increase in fish and shellfish impingement and entrainment will be less than 3.5% over Unit 1 and 2 existing conditions.\n\nIn February 2009, Calvert Cliffs set a world record for pressurized water reactors (PWRs) by operating 692 days non-stop. In addition, Unit 2's capacity factor in 2008 was a world-record high of 101.37 percent.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 US population within of Calvert Cliffs was 48,798, an increase of 86.4 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 2,890,702, a decrease of 2.0 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Washington, D.C., (45 miles to city center).\n\nIn 2001, when the Dominion Cove Point LNG plant was scheduled to reopen, many local residents were concerned about the proximity to this nuclear power plant (3 miles). Residents thought that the FERC did not consider the risks could be caused by an attack or an explosion before opening the plant.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Calvert Cliffs was 1 in 100,000 for Reactor 1 and 1 in 83,333 for Reactor 2, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nUnit 2 at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant was shut down on September 5, 2013, after a malfunction during testing. It was re-opened September 10, 2013, after the required maintenance was performed.\n\nScientists at Johns Hopkins University became concerned that the discharge of heated cooling water from the plant would be detrimental to a crucial element of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, the bay's famed blue crabs. In the late 1960s, litigation borne of Congress's National Environmental Policy Act eventually spawned one of the most celebrated environmental cases in American history, \"Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee, Inc. v. Atomic Energy Commission\", forcing the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) to consider the environmental impact of building and maintaining such an atomic energy plant.\n\nIn 2000, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended the license of the plant for 20 additional years, making Calvert Cliffs the first nuclear plant in the United States to receive such an extension. President George W. Bush visited the plant in June 2005, the first time a president had visited a nuclear power plant in nearly two decades.\n\nUniStar Nuclear Energy announced plans to build a unit of the Evolutionary Power Reactor (\"US-EPR\" variant) at Calvert Cliffs. UniStar Nuclear Energy, a Delaware limited liability company, was jointly owned by Constellation Energy (CEG) and Électricité de France (EDF), the European builder and supplier of nuclear power plants. The proposed unit was to produce approximately twice the energy of each individual existing unit. On July 13, 2007, UniStar Nuclear Energy filed a partial application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review its plans to build a new nuclear power plant, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant 3 (CCNPP 3) based on the AREVA \"US Evolutionary Power Reactor\" (US-EPR), Generation III+, four loop pressurized water reactor.\n\nThe third reactor was intended to address a need for more baseload power generation in the Mid-Atlantic region. The unit proposed to be located south of the existing units 1 and 2, set back from the shoreline. Although only a single unit, its power plant footprint was almost twice the size of the existing units together. It was to have a closed-loop cooling system using a single hybrid mechanical draft cooling tower, incorporating plume abatement for no visible water vapor plume from the tower. Units 1 and 2 use an open-cycle heat dissipation system without cooling towers. The cooling tower of the Unit 3 reactor was to release two thirds of its waste heat to the atmosphere. The proposed EPR design was a saturated steam plant with one high-pressure turbine in tandem with three low-pressure turbines and a main generator design similar to Unit 1 and2. ALSTOM was to supply the main steam turbine and main generator.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, UniStar Nuclear Energy filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission for authority to construct CCNPP 3. This application is being considered in Case Number 9127.\n\nOpponents and supporters of the proposed third reactor at Calvert Cliffs were involved in a series of public hearings before officials of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In March 2009, Bill Peil of southern Calvert County asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to deny an emissions permit for the reactor due to health and safety concerns he asserted that the plant posed to the community. UniStar Nuclear Energy President and CEO George Vanderheyden urged the NRC to approve the air permit application.\n\nIn October 2010, Constellation Energy said that it had reached an impasse in negotiations for a federal loan guarantee to build the proposed third reactor. The government sought a fee of $880 million on a guarantee of about $7.6 billion, to compensate taxpayers for the risk of default. Constellation Energy replied that such a fee would doom the project, “or the economics of any nuclear project, for that matter”.\n\nIn November 2010 a deal to transfer Constellation Energy Group's stake in a nuclear development company to its French partner, EDF Group, closed, according to the SEC. A month prior, Constellation agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in UniStar Nuclear Energy to EDF for US$140 million, giving EDF sole ownership of the joint venture and its plans to develop a third unit at Calvert Cliffs in Southern Maryland. The deal called for EDF to transfer 3.5 million shares it owns, valued around US$110 million, to Constellation and give up its seat on the Constellation board. EDF designee Samuel Minzberg resigned.\n\nIn April 2011 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) stated that UniStar is not eligible to build a third reactor, as it is not a US owned company since Constellation pulled out of the partnership in 2010. The NRC would continue to process the application, but a license would not be issued until the ownership requirements were met. The reactor was estimated to cost $9.6 billion.\n\nConstellation Energy merged into Exelon in 2012.\n\nIn 2015 Areva, struggling with internal restructuring of its corporation, withdrew from the certification process for the \"US EPR\" reactor design, effectively putting on hold plans for the deployment of a European reactor in the US.\n\nThe Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant consist of two operational reactors, one additional was proposed in 2007 and withdrawn.\n\n"}
{"id": "1800732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800732", "title": "Second messenger system", "text": "Second messenger system\n\nSecond messengers are intracellular signaling molecules released by the cell in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules—the first messengers. (Intracellular signals, a non-local form or cell signaling, encompassing both first messengers and second messengers, are classified as juxtacrine, paracrine, and endocrine depending on the range of the signal.) Second messengers trigger physiological changes at cellular level such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, apoptosis and depolarization. \n\nThey are one of the triggers of intracellular signal transduction cascades. \n\nExamples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and calcium. First messengers are extracellular factors, often hormones or neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine, growth hormone, and serotonin. Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules, these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly—unlike steroid hormones, which usually do. This functional limitation requires the cell to have signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers, so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly. An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal. For example, RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB.\n\nEarl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr., discovered second messengers, for which he won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sutherland saw that epinephrine would stimulate the liver to convert glycogen to glucose (sugar) in liver cells, but epinephrine alone would not convert glycogen to glucose. He found that epinephrine had to trigger a second messenger, cyclic AMP, for the liver to convert glycogen to glucose. The mechanisms were worked out in detail by Martin Rodbell and Alfred G. Gilman, who won the 1994 Nobel Prize.\n\nSecondary messenger systems can be synthesized and activated by enzymes, for example, the cyclases that synthesize cyclic nucleotides, or by opening of ion channels to allow influx of metal ions, for example Ca signaling. These small molecules bind and activate protein kinases, ion channels, and other proteins, thus continuing the signaling cascade.\n\nThere are three basic types of secondary messenger molecules:\n\nThese intracellular messengers have some properties in common:\n\nThere are several different secondary messenger systems (cAMP system, phosphoinositol system, and arachidonic acid system), but they all are quite similar in overall mechanism, although the substances involved and overall effects can vary.\n\nIn most cases, a ligand binds to a membrane-spanning receptor protein molecule. The binding of a ligand to the receptor causes a conformation change in the receptor. This conformation change can affect the activity of the receptor and result in the production of active second messengers.\n\nIn the case of G protein-coupled receptors, the conformation change exposes a binding site for a \"G-protein\". The G-protein (named for the GDP and GTP molecules that bind to it) is bound to the inner membrane of the cell and consists of three subunits: alpha, beta and gamma. The G-protein is known as the \"transducer.\"\n\nWhen the G-protein binds with the receptor, it becomes able to exchange a GDP (guanosine diphosphate) molecule on its alpha subunit for a GTP (guanosine triphosphate) molecule. Once this exchange takes place, the alpha subunit of the G-protein transducer breaks free from the beta and gamma subunits, all parts remaining membrane-bound. The alpha subunit, now free to move along the inner membrane, eventually contacts another membrane-bound protein - the \"primary effector.\"\n\nThe primary effector then has an action, which creates a signal that can diffuse within the cell. This signal is called the \"second (or secondary) messenger.\" The secondary messenger may then activate a \"secondary effector\" whose effects depend on the particular secondary messenger system.\n\nCalcium ions are one type of second messengers and are responsible for many important physiological functions including muscle contraction, fertilization, and neurotransmitter release. The ions are normally bound or stored in intracellular components (such as the endoplasmic reticulum(ER)) and can be released during signal transduction. The enzyme phospholipase C produces diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, which increases calcium ion permeability into the membrane. Active G-protein open up calcium channels to let calcium ions enter the plasma membrane. The other product of phospholipase C, diacylglycerol, activates protein kinase C, which assists in the activation of cAMP (another second messenger).\n\nIP, DAG, and Ca are second messengers in the phosphoinositol pathway. The pathway begins with the binding of extracellular primary messengers such as epinephrine, acetylcholine, and hormones AGT, GnRH, GHRH, oxytocin, and TRH, to their respective receptors. Epinephrine binds to the α1 GTPase Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and acetylcholine binds to M1 and M2 GPCR.\n\nBinding of a primary messenger to these receptors results in conformational change of the receptor. The α subunit, with the help of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFS), releases GDP, and binds GTP, resulting in the dissociation of the subunit and subsequent activation. The activated α subunit activates phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in the formation of secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP). IP3 binds to calcium pumps on ER, transporting Ca, another second messenger, into the cytoplasm. Ca ultimately binds to many proteins, activating a cascade of enzymatic pathways.\n\n"}

He was promoted to \"Leutnant\" in 1937.\n\nIn late 1942, the tank battalion under Loringhoven's command was encircled during the Soviet counter-offensive at the Battle of Stalingrad. On 23 January 1943, he was awarded the German Cross in Gold () as \"Hauptmann\" (captain) in the 2./Panzer-Regiment 2. That same month, he was flown out of the pocket and later transferred to the staff of 111th Infantry Division on 2 March 1943. In November 1943, Loringhoven was promoted to major. From July 1944 to April 1945, he served as an adjutant to the Chief of Army General Staff (first, General Heinz Guderian and then General Hans Krebs).\n\nLoringhoven's last assignment was as a staff officer responsible for the preparation of reports for Adolf Hitler. This work required a constant presence in Hitler's entourage. After 23 April 1945, when Hitler's communications staff began to desert, he had to improvise and he based his intelligence reports on information he was able to gather from the Allied news agencies Reuters and the BBC. Fortunately for him, Hitler was not aware of this.\n\nIn the evening of 29 April, he left the \"Führerbunker\" with Gerhard Boldt and Lieutenant-Colonel Rudolf Weiss. That morning, Loringhoven had approached Krebs and asked if he and Boldt could leave Berlin and \"return to the fighting troops\". Krebs talked to Burgdorf to get his advice. Burgdorf approved but indicated that they should take his assistant, Weiss. Hitler was approached for his approval at midday. Surprisingly, he asked many questions and offered his advice. Hitler asked, \"How are you going to get out of Berlin?\" When Loringhoven mentioned finding a boat, Hitler became enthusiastic and advised, \"You must get an electric boat, because that does not make any noise and you can get through the Russian lines.\" When he agreed that an electric boat would be best but added that, if necessary, they might have to use a different craft, Hitler was suddenly exhausted. He shook hands limply with each of them and quickly dismissed the group.\n\nCaptured by the British Army on 3 May 1945, Loringhoven spent two and a half years as a prisoner of war. He was not charged with war crimes. After being repatriated in January 1948, he lived in Munich, where he became a publisher. He joined the German Federal Armed Forces (\"Bundeswehr\") in 1956 after West Germany joined NATO. He served in various army and NATO positions; his highest rank was lieutenant-general. He was later appointed Deputy Inspector General of the Armed Forces and retired from the army in 1973, with full honours.\n\nLate in life, Loringhoven, long a knight of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg), actively served the Order as its chancellor and governor. At the time of his death at the age of 93, he was one of the last three known living witnesses (along with bunker telephone operator Rochus Misch and Hitler Youth courier Armin Lehmann) to the events in the \"Führerbunker\" at the end of World War II.\n\n\"Freiherr\" is a title, translated as Baron, not a first or middle name. The female forms are \"Freifrau\" (the wife of a \"Freiherr\") and \"Freiin\" (the daughter of a \"Freiherr\").\n\nAlthough he had left the bunker complex before the time of Hitler's suicide, Loringhoven was often called to testify and to co-operate in script writing. For example, he participated in this way in the film \"Downfall\" (\"Der Untergang\"). In his memoirs, published as \"In the Bunker with Hitler: The Last Witness Speaks\", Loringhoven focussed chiefly on the final months of the Nazi regime. Loringhoven was the father of Arndt Freytag von Loringhoven, formerly vice president of the \"Bundesnachrichtendienst\".\n"}

Ginna Nuclear Power Plant\n\nThe Robert Emmett Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, commonly known as Ginna ( ), is a nuclear power plant located on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, in the town of Ontario, Wayne County, New York, approximately east of Rochester, New York. It is a single unit Westinghouse 2-Loop pressurized water reactor, similar to those at Point Beach, Kewaunee, and Prairie Island. Having gone into commercial operation in 1970, Ginna became the second oldest nuclear power reactor, after nine mile unit 1, still in operation in the United States when the Oyster Creek power plant was permanently shut down on September 17, 2018.\n\nThe plant was named after Robert Emmett Ginna, a former chief executive of Rochester Gas & Electric, who was one of the nation's earliest advocates of using nuclear energy to generate electricity.\n\nGinna is owned and operated by Exelon after the merger with CENG, who purchased it from Rochester Gas and Electric in 2004.\n\nThe Ginna plant was the site of a nuclear accident when, on January 25, 1982, a small amount of radioactive steam leaked into the air after a steam-generator tube ruptured. The leak which lasted 93 minutes led to the declaration of a site emergency. The rupture was caused by a small pie-pan-shaped object left in the steam generator during an outage. This was not the first time a tube rupture had occurred at an American reactor but following on so closely behind the Three Mile Island accident caused considerable attention to be focused on the incident at the Ginna plant. In total, 485.3 curies of noble gas and 1.15 millicuries of iodine-131 were released to the environment and 1,690 gallons of contaminated water was lost from the reactor.\n\nIn 1996 the original Westinghouse supplied steam generators (including the one that was damaged in 1982 and repaired) were replaced by two brand new Babcock & Wilcox steam generators. This project enabled an uprating of Ginna's output several years later and was a major factor in the approval of the plant's operating license extension for 20 years beyond the original license (originally valid until 2009).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Ginna was 66,847, an increase of 12.7 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,269,589, an increase of 2.1 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Rochester (17 miles to city center). Canadian population is not included in these figures.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Ginna was 1 in 76,923, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\nhttp://www.whec.com/whecimages/ginna_nuclear.jpg\n\n"}

Eikerenkoetter II, better known as Reverend Ike (June 1, 1935 – July 28, 2009), was an American minister and evangelist based in New York City. He was known for the slogan \"You can't lose with the stuff I use!\" His preaching is considered a form of prosperity theology.\n\nFrederick J. Eikerenkoetter II was born in Ridgeland, South Carolina to parents from the Netherlands Antilles, and was of African and Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) descent. He began his career as a teenage preacher and became assistant pastor at Bible Way Church in Ridgeland, South Carolina. After serving a stint in the Air Force as a Chaplain Service Specialist (a non-commissioned officer assigned to assist commissioned Air Force chaplains), he founded, successively, the United Church of Jesus Christ for All People in Beaufort, South Carolina, the United Christian Evangelistic Association in Boston, Massachusetts, his main corporate entity, and the Christ Community United Church in New York City. \nKnown popularly as \"Reverend Ike,\" his ministry reached its peak in the mid 1970s, when his weekly radio sermons were carried by hundreds of stations across the United States. He was famous for his \"Blessing Plan\" – radio listeners sent him money and in return he blessed them. He said doing this would make radio listeners who did it more prosperous. He was criticized for his overt interest in financial remuneration. In 1972, \"The New York Times\" described his church service:\nRev. Ike bought the Loew's 175th Street Theatre movie palace in the Washington Heights neighborhood for over half a million dollars, renamed it the \"Palace Cathedral\" – although colloquially it was known as \"Reverend Ike's Prayer Tower\" – and had it fully restored. Restorations included the seven-story high, twin chamber Robert Morton organ. The \"Miracle Star of Faith\", visible from the George Washington Bridge, tops the building’s cupola. In 2016, the building was designated as a landmark by the New York City Landmark Commission.\n\nRev. Ike was also the \"chancellor\" of the United Church Schools, including the Science of Living Institute and Seminary (which awarded him, his wife, and his son Doctor of the Science of Living degrees); the Business of Living Institute (home of Thinkonomics); and other educational projects.\n\nIke made a guest appearance on Hank Williams, Jr.'s single “Mind Your Own Business”, a Number One country music hit in December 1986. This song is Reverend Ike's only chart single.\n\nIn December 2005, John Lennon and Yoko Ono's personal assistant May Pang told \"Radio Times\": \n\nIke and his wife, Eula M. Dent, had one son, Xavier Eikerenkoetter. Reverend Ike died in Los Angeles at age 74 on July 28, 2009, after having not fully recovered from a stroke in 2007. His son gave a moving eulogy at his father's memorial service comparing his father to Martin Luther King and Malcolm X – as a \"spiritual activist\" and a liberator of minds. Xavier subsequently took over the church.\n\n"}

It is one of two accepted species in the genus Myrrhis.\n\nThe genus name \"Myrrhis\" derives from the Greek word myrrhis [μυρρίς], an aromatic oil from Asia. The Latin species name \"odorata\" means \"scented\".\n\n \"Myrrhis odorata\" is a tall herbaceous perennial plant growing to 2 m [6 ft 6 in] tall, depending on circumstances. The leaves are fern-like, 2-4-pinnate, finely divided, feathery, up to 50 cm long, with whitish patches near the rachis. The plant is softly hairy and smells strongly of aniseed when crushed. The flowers are creamy-white, about 2–4 mm across, produced in large umbels. The flowering period extends from May to June. The fruits are slender, dark brown, 15–25 mm long and 3–4 mm broad.\n\n\"Myrrhis odorata\" is native to mountains of southern and central Europe, from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus. It has been introduced and naturalized elsewhere in cultivated areas, woodland margins, roadside verges, river banks and grassland. In the British Isles it is most abundant in northern England and eastern Scotland.\n\nIn fertile soils it grows readily from seed, and may be increased by division in spring or autumn.\n\nIts leaves are sometimes used as a herb, either raw or cooked, with a rather strong taste reminiscent of anise. The roots and seeds also are edible. Additionally, it has a history of use as a medicinal herb.\n\nLike its relatives anise, fennel, and caraway, it can also be used to flavour akvavit.

{"id": "1800764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800764", "title": "Stardust fire", "text": "Stardust fire\n\nThe Stardust fire was a fatal fire which took place at the Stardust nightclub in Artane, Dublin, Ireland in the early hours of 14 February (Valentine's Day) 1981. Some 420 people had attended a disco there, of whom 48 died and 214 were injured as a result of the fire. The club was located where Butterly Business Park now lies, opposite Artane Castle Shopping Centre.\n\nThe building which housed the Stardust was built in 1948 and was initially a food factory, operated by Scott's Foods Ltd. In 1978, the owners of Scott's Food Factory, the Butterly family, converted the premises into an amenity centre, consisting of a bar, The Silver Swan, a function room, The Lantern Rooms, and a nightclub, The Stardust. The club premises consisted of a dance floor, stage, two bars and two seating alcoves, the North Alcove and the West Alcove. There were also tables and chairs on the dance floor area.\n\nThe fire started in a first-floor storeroom inside the building that was open to the roof space. The fire outbreak is believed to have derived from an electrical fault in the room beside the roof space. This non-planning-permission-compliant first-floor storage room contained dangerously flammable materials, including 45 five-gallon drums of cooking oil. Staff observed a small fire outbreak on a seat in an alcove behind a curtain and they attempted to extinguish it but failed. The blaze apparently started after fire on the roof from the storeroom came through the roof tiles and emerged into the nightclub's West Alcove banked seating area, falling onto the backrest and the top of a seating bench covered in PVC-coated polyester fabric. The West Alcove area had enough seats to fit at least 280 patrons. The fire was observed by a lady who was sitting in front of the West Alcove. She noticed an increase in temperature but did not smell smoke. The fire then spread to tables and chairs, and patrons noticed smoke and smelled burning. The DJ announced that there was a small fire and requested a calm evacuation.\n\nA man by coincidence was making a phone call to the Gardaí at Dublin Castle at 1:42 a.m.:\nGardaí: Hello, yes, hello. \nO'Toole: I'm at the Stardust disco. Can you hear me? \nGardaí: Yes. \nO'Toole: And my girlfriend's handbag was robbed. \nGardaí: Your girlfriend's handbag was robbed? \nO'Toole: She's the manageress in the shoe shop in Northside Shopping Centre. \nGardaí: Wait now would you...Stardust? \nO'Toole: Yes, I'm in the Stardust disco, discotheque, and my girlfriend's bag went missing, someone's after taking it. Can you hear me? \nGardaí: Yes. \nO'Toole: Can you hear me? \nGardaí: And where were you... where were... the guards, where will you meet the guards? \nO'Toole: Pardon? \nGardaí: What's your name... what is your name? \nO'Toole: Hello? \nGardaí: What is your name? \nO'Toole: (Screams in background, caller hung up)\"\nThe call was terminated by the man hanging up as the first alarm of fire was given to the people in the foyer.\n\nThe fire was first spotted by numerous external witnesses as well as a lady 200 metres away from the Stardust, who quickly called the Fire Brigade. Within minutes of her call, two other calls were made from the Stardust building to inform the Fire Brigade of a small fire six inches high on a seat in the Ballroom in the west section of the building. The fire was very small when first seen in the Ballroom. Within two minutes of the fire being reported, a ferocious burst of heat and thick black smoke started quickly coming from the ceiling, causing the material in the ceiling to melt and drip on top of patrons and other highly flammable materials, including the seats and carpet tiles on the walls. The fire flashover enveloped the club and the lights failed. This caused mass panic as patrons began desperately looking for an escape.\n\nThe attendees at a trade union function taking place in the same building made their escape, but the escape of some of the Stardust patrons was hampered by a number of obstructions. Some of the main fire exits were padlocked around the push bars and consequently were impossible to open.\n\nThe failure of the lighting in the club led to widespread panic, causing mass trampling as many of the patrons instinctively ran for the main entrance. Many people mistook the entrance to the men's toilets for the main entrance doors, but the windows there had metal plates fixed on the inside and iron bars on the outside. Firemen attempted to pull off the metal bars using a chain attached to a fire engine, but were unsuccessful. Firemen rescued between 25–30 of those trapped in the front toilets.\n\nAmbulances from Dublin Fire Brigade, the Eastern Health Board, Dublin Civil Defence, the Red Cross, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps, St John Ambulance Ireland, and the Airport Fire Rescue Service were dispatched to the scene. Many ambulances left the scene carrying up to 15 casualties. CIÉ also sent buses to transport the injured, and local radio stations asked people in the vicinity with cars to come to the club. The city's hospitals were overwhelmed by the influx of injured and dying, in particular the Mater, Jervis Street and Dr Steevens' Hospitals.\n\nThe investigation at the time reported that the fire was an arson. The finding of arson has recently been ruled out by investigators, as there was never any evidence to support the arson finding, even at the time of the tragedy.\n\nA total of 48 people died in the fire. The community was devastated, with most of the dead coming from Artane, Kilmore and greater Coolock. A tribunal of inquiry under Justice Ronan Keane concluded in November 1981 that the fire was probably caused by arson. This finding, which has been disputed ever since, legally exonerated the owners from responsibility. However, the inquiry was damning in its criticism of the safety standards. Keane also criticised the owners and management of the Stardust for \"recklessly dangerous practices\" when it was discovered that some emergency exit doors had been locked and impeded on the night of the fire.\n\nThe families of the victims and survivors fought in the courts for compensation, accountability, and, in their eyes, justice. The owners, the Butterly family, were nevertheless free to pursue their own claim for compensation against the city because of the arson finding – and were eventually awarded IR£580,000.\n\nThe aftermath led to a huge number of recommendations being made in relation to fire safety. Comparisons were made to the Summerland disaster of 1973 in the Isle of Man and the lessons learned in that jurisdiction. However, some basic rules, such as the provision of fire extinguishers and fire exits being left unblocked and obviously posted, which have since been implemented, could probably have prevented many deaths if they had existed at the time.\n\nIn 2006, the leaseholder and manager of the Stardust at the time of the fire, Eamon Butterly, planned to re-open licensed premises on the site of the Stardust on the 25th anniversary. Described as \"insensitive\", this action occasioned protests by the victims' families and their supporters. The protests lasted for 10 weeks and ended when the Butterly family agreed to erect a memorial on the site, and change the name of the pub from \"The Silver Swan\" to the \"Artane House\". The name \"The Silver Swan\" was the name of a pub attached to the nightclub, and so was rejected by the protestors. In 2007, the bodies of five victims whom authorities had been unable to identify were exhumed from a communal plot in St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton. The remains were identified with modern DNA analysis, and then given separate burials.\n\nIn July 1985, Irish folk singer Christy Moore was found guilty of contempt of court after writing and releasing a song, entitled \"They Never Came Home\", about the plight of the \"Stardust\" fire victims, seemingly damning the owners of the nightclub and the government. It contained the following lines:\n\nand\n\nBecause it appeared to imply that the obstruction of the exits was solely responsible for the deaths and injuries, the song was banned and removed from the \"Ordinary Man\" album it had appeared on. As the album had just been released, it had to be withdrawn from circulation and re-issued with \"Another Song is Born\" in its place. Early versions of this album are considered rare and collectible.\n\nThe lyrics of the song are still banned in Ireland as libelous. However, a live recording of the song is available on the collection \"The Box Set: 1964 – 2004\" in many other countries, including the UK.\n\nThis song was played for 10 weeks outside the \"Silver Swan\" as part of the protest over the re-opening of the pub in 2006. It was played every night from 6PM until 8PM while the families and supporters demonstrated in front of the filling station. The song was reputedly played for so long that three tapes failed, leading the protesters to use a CD player, which failed after eight days. They then resorted to an MP3 player (connected to an amplifier), which lasted for the duration of the protest a week later.\n\nIn 2006, Ireland's national broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), caused controversy by producing a docu-drama about the disaster entitled \"Stardust\", to mark the 25th anniversary of the incident. The series was based on the book \"They Never Came Home: The Stardust Story\" by Neil Fetherstonhaugh and Tony McCullagh. Many families of victims objected to this and were upset by the painful memories it brought up. Reasons for objection were the focus on some key families, which some felt portrayed the disaster as only really impacting a select few, the depiction of the actual fire and a silent roll call of all the victims who perished. A preview of this drama was shown to relatives in early February 2006 and after some minor changes it was broadcast on 12 and 13 February 2006. In this version, the silent roll call was changed to one where all names were read out by survivor Jimmy Fitzpatrick, and a voiceover was added to explain throughout the narrative that the fire impacted many more families and individuals than those portrayed predominantly in the film.\n\nAn edition of \"Prime Time\", RTÉ's current affairs programme, broadcast on 14 February 2006, cast doubts on some of the findings of the original tribunal. The programme produced witnesses who were outside the building on the night. Some outside saw fire coming from the roof up to eight minutes before those inside did. New evidence concerning the building's contents and layout was also presented. Important details were also shown regarding the actual location of a storeroom containing flammable materials and cleaning agents. The document plan of the building which the tribunal used, and which was critical to its findings, was shown to be confusingly flawed by locating the storeroom on the wrong level. It showed the storeroom to be \"over the basement\", but there was no basement in the building, and the store and lamp rooms were located in the roof space on the first floor.\n\nThe list of contents of the store was not put before the inquiry and included large amounts of highly flammable and spontaneously combustible materials, mostly polishes and floor waxes, with the inquiry assuming only normal everyday items were inside.\n\nA re-enactment of the fire suggested that it did not happen as the tribunal had found. The programme theorised that the fire started in the roof space where the storeroom was located and had already spread across the main nightclub roof space area before those inside were aware of it. Furthermore, there were reports that the lamp room adjacent to the store had had several instances in preceding weeks of smouldering, smoking and sparking of the electrical installations within, which could conceivably have been the original ignition source. If this is true, the original finding of \"probable arson\" is in doubt.\n\nAlso, if true, it mirrors events decades earlier in the fatal Henderson's Department Store Fire in Liverpool, where a fire strongly suspected as starting in electrical cabling rapidly spread in and across false ceiling space, hidden until it broke out ferociously across a large area.\n\nIn 2009, four relatives of those who had died in the fire held a sit-in in a security hut at Government Buildings. They were asking the government to publish a report that examined the need to open a new investigation into the disaster.\n\nFollowing the above protests the Government commissioned an independent examination by Paul Coffey SC of the case submitted by the Stardust Victims Committee for a Reopened Inquiry into the Stardust Fire Disaster.\n\nDue to the passage of time and lack of physical evidence, it stated that it would not be in the public interest to reopen the Public Inquiry, but that the public record should be altered to reflect paragraph 6.167 of the original inquiry- \"The cause of fire is not known and may never be known. There is no evidence of an accidental origin: and equally no evidence that the fire was started deliberately\" instead of that of arson (which led to the Butterly's compensation).\n\nFollowing its publication, the Dáil voted on the evening of 3 February 2009 to acknowledge that the arson finding was hypothetical and that none of those present at the Stardust nightclub can be held responsible for the blaze. This led to a correction of the public record and the original arson conclusion was removed as the cause, due to there being no evidence to suggest that the fire was started maliciously.\n\nDespite the clear breaches of fire safety regulations, the owners never faced charges and have never apologized.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, a documentary entitled \"Remembering Stardust: 30 Years On\" aired on TV3. The documentary reflected on the events of the night of the fire, the aftermath and the various controversies and legal proceedings that followed. Survivors Jimmy Fitzpatrick and Antoinette Keegan along with retired Dublin fireman Paul Shannon were among those interviewed.\n\nOn 13 February 2011, there was an afternoon Mass at Saint Joseph's Church in Coolock and a wreath was placed at the Stardust Memorial Park. The following evening, a candlelight vigil was held at the Stardust grounds.\n\nIn December 2017, RTÉ did a one-hour episode of a TV series where Charlie Bird interviewed survivors of the Stardust fire and relatives of some of the 48 people who died in the fire.\n\nIn June 2018, a campaign was launched to get as many signatures as possible on postcards \nto appeal to the Attorney General of Ireland to finalize the coroner's reports on the deaths of the 48 young people killed in the fire.\n\nOn 25 September 2019, the Attorney General confirmed that fresh inquests will be held into the 48 deaths at the 1981 Stardust fire.\n\n"}

Her mother didn't tell her that her father had died for many weeks, thinking it would affect her game.\n\nAt age six, Li followed her father's footsteps and started playing badminton, which honed her reflexes. Just before she turned eight, Li was persuaded to switch to tennis by coach Xia Xiyao of the Wuhan youth tennis club. Her instructors taught tennis through negative reinforcement, which affected Li's confidence in later years. Li joined China's National Tennis Team in 1997. The following year, Li, sponsored by Nike, went to John Newcombe Academy in Texas to study tennis. She studied there for ten months and returned to China. Growing up, her favourite tennis player was Andre Agassi. She turned professional in 1999 at the age of sixteen.\n\nAt the end of 2002, Li left the national tennis team to study part-time at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where she completed her bachelor's degree in journalism in 2009. The Chinese media cited various reasons for this. Some reported that the relationship between her and her teammate and future husband, Jiang Shan (), was opposed by the national team's management, some reported that her coach, Yu Liqiao (), was too strict and demanding, while other reports claimed that her request for a personal coach did not go through. However, some regarded that it was just the health problem leading to the retirement. The \"New York Times\" reported that one of the reasons was that a team leader wanted her to play through by taking hormone medicine as Li struggled with her performance due to hormone imbalance.\nLi returned to the national team in 2004. Jiang Shan married Li on 27 January 2006, and became her personal coach. Li quit the national team as well as the state-run sports system in 2008 under an experimental reform policy for tennis players. This change was called \"Fly Solo\" () by Chinese media. As a result, Li had the freedom to hire her own coaching staff and she would be solely responsible for the cost of training and coaching and tour expense. She could keep more of her winnings, with only eight percent of her winnings going to the Chinese Tennis Association development fund as opposed to 65 percent previously. In the summer of 2012, the requirement of contribution to the Chinese tennis development fund was lifted and Li kept all her prize money.\n\nOn 5 June 2016, Li was commissioned by Special Olympics as a Global Ambassador.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, Li announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child. She gave birth to her daughter Alisa in June 2015.\n\nLi turned professional in 1999, and won three of the first four singles tournaments she entered on the ITF Circuit, two at Shenzhen and one at Westende, Belgium. She also won all of her first seven ITF doubles tournaments she entered.\n\nIn 2000, she won 52 singles matches on the ITF circuit, more than any other player, notching another eight tournament titles, including one at the $50k level, two at $25k, and a run of four $10k tournament wins in March and April.\n\nNotable individual victories in the course of the year included wins over Flavia Pennetta, Emmanuelle Gagliardi, Maria Elena Camerin, Tamarine Tanasugarn and Yayuk Basuki.\n\nIn June, after Li's world ranking had risen to No. 136 on the strength of her ITF performances alone, she gained direct entry into her first WTA Tour event at Tashkent. Despite winning the first set, Li lost her first WTA singles match to Anna Zaporozhanova in three sets, but she captured the women's doubles title at Tashkent with Li Ting against Zaporozhanova and Iroda Tulyaganova.\n\nBy the end of 2000, Li had won four WTA singles matches, this brought her cumulative ITF singles title count up to 11. That year, she also won seven more ITF doubles events, six of them with Li Ting.\n\nLi was mostly absent from the tour in 2001. She won two further $25k ITF singles tournaments, defeating Roberta Vinci in the final at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Liu Nannan in the final at Guangzhou in July, but then played only one further match for the rest of the year, leading her ranking to fall to no. 303 by the year's close.\n\nShe won her 15th career ITF doubles tournament at Hangzhou in March.\n\nIn 2002, she came through qualifying to win her first $75k singles tournament at Midland, USA in February, defeating Laura Granville, Tatiana Perebiynis, and Mashona Washington en route to the title, the 14th of her career. But she then played only one more match (a loss to Zuzana Ondrášková in the $50k event at Dinan, France that April), followed by a lengthy absence from the circuit for the next 25 months.\n\nSources vary as to the causes of this absence, the Chinese media mostly cited the conflict between her and the China's National Tennis Team's administration and coaching staff. Some claimed that she just wanted a break from professional tennis so she could concentrate on her studies at university.\n\nIn May 2004, Li returned to competition after having not played since 2002. Although she was unranked, she won 26 successive matches to notch three further $25k tournament wins and another $50k title, increasing her career singles title count to 18, only to have her winning streak finally snapped by Evgenia Linetskaya in the semifinal of the $50k Bronx tournament that August. However, she won her 16th ITF doubles tournament at the same event, the 17th overall doubles title of her career.\n\nThat September, she lost in the final of a $25k tournament to compatriot Zheng Jie, before returning to the WTA Tour, thanks to a wild-card entry into qualifying at the Beijing. There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that she had felt as though she was up against a top-five player.\n\nThe very next week, Li battled her way through qualifying into the WTA event at Guangzhou (a Tier IV event at the time, though since has been upgraded to Tier III), then beat Vera Dushevina, Jelena Janković, Kristina Brandi, and Li Ting in the main draw to reach the final, where she overcame Martina Suchá to win her first WTA Tour title. By doing so, Li became the first Chinese tennis player to win a WTA event.\n\nOn the back of the ranking points accrued through this result, on 4 October 2004, she broke into the WTA top 100 for the first time.\n\nTo cap off her most successful year as a singles player yet, she competed in two $50,000 ITF tournaments at Shenzhen, winning the first outright to bring her the 19th ITF singles title and 20th overall singles title of her career, but losing in the quarterfinals of the second to lower-ranked country-woman Yan Zi. These results elevated Li Na to world No. 80 by the close of the year, a year in which she won 51 singles matches and lost just four.\n\n2005 saw Li finally abandoning the ITF circuit to focus solely on WTA-level events. She began the year with a second-round performance at Gold Coast and a semifinal showing at Hobart, but losing to fellow Chinese player and eventual tournament champion Zheng Jie. She then made her Grand Slam debut at the 2005 Australian Open, advancing to the third round with wins over Laura Granville and Shinobu Asagoe before losing to Maria Sharapova. In early February, she reached the quarterfinals at Hyderabad and qualified for Doha where she was narrowly beaten by Patty Schnyder in the first round of the main draw. After a victory over Ai Sugiyama in the first round at Dubai the following week, it was Schnyder once again who stopped her from reaching the later stages of the event.\n\nAfter taking a month off from competition, Li returned at Estoril in late April, defeating Stéphanie Cohen-Aloro, Nicole Pratt, Dally Randriantefy, and then crushing Dinara Safina to reach her second WTA Tour final. Li was denied the title by Czech qualifier Lucie Šafářová, who prevailed in a close three-set match. At Rabat in May, Li reached the semifinal stage, but further success ultimately proved elusive for her. With the score leveled at 3–3, she retired due to a right ankle sprain while clashing with Zheng Jie. Reaching this semifinal propelled her to a career-high singles ranking of world No. 33, but the injury she had sustained was destined to keep her out of action for the next three months. On her return at Los Angeles in August, she fell in the first round to Anna Chakvetadze of Russia. The following week, however, at the Canadian Open, she once more beat Jelena Janković and María Vento-Kabchi, before losing to Nadia Petrova in the third round.\n\nIt was Lindsay Davenport who proved her undoing in her next two tournaments, beating her in the first round of the US Open, and at the semifinal stage in Bali in September, but not before Li Na had avenged her previous year's defeat by Yan Zi in the second round of the same tournament. The following week, another highly ranked American player, Jill Craybas, narrowly defeated Li Na in a close three-set first-round match at Beijing. Li commenced her defense of her Guangzhou title; but she was prevented from completing it in the quarterfinals by eventual champion Yan Zi, who thereby edged out in front in their head-to-head record once again. This second loss in three head-to-heads against Yan proved to be Li's last match of 2005; and in her absence from the Shenzhen $50k tournaments where she had notched up some ranking points late the previous year, she found herself slipping further in the rankings from the high-point of No. 33 that she had reached in the spring before her injury break, to No. 56 at the year's close.\n\nWith nearly all her remaining ranking points to defend concentrated in a little over the first four months of the year, Li began the year faced with the challenge of equaling her strong results from the early part of 2005 in order to maintain her position in the middle reaches of the WTA top 100. Early-round draws against high-ranked players towards the beginning of 2006 took a heavy toll on Li's singles ranking, bringing it slipping down to No. 71 by the end of February.\n\nShe returned with a career-best performance at Tier I events by reaching the semifinal at Berlin. On the way there, she achieved her first victory over a current top-10-ranked player as she ousted Patty Schnyder for the first time at the quarterfinal stage. However, this match left her with a muscle sprain, and she lost to Nadia Petrova in the semifinal. Nonetheless, her performance at this high-level tournament saw her ranked No. 39. Joining the WTA grass-court season for the first time at the DFS Classic tournament at Birmingham in June, she managed another third-round finish with wins over Mashona Washington and grass-court specialist Eleni Daniilidou, both in straight sets, then lost for the third time in three meetings to Maria Sharapova. Her ranking following this tournament was no. 30, which was at that time the highest ever ranking achieved by a Chinese woman.\n\nAt the same event, partnering Jelena Janković, she notched up her second career WTA doubles title, almost exactly six years from her first at Tashkent. An early retirement against Alona Bondarenko in the first round of the Ondina Open at 's-Hertogenbosch the following week curtailed her final competitive preparations for her debut appearance at Wimbledon. But with an entry ranking of 30th, she found herself seeded 27th after some withdrawals, and thus achieved another first for her country in becoming the first Chinese woman ever to be seeded for entry into a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nAt Wimbledon, she reached the fourth round with comfortable straight-sets wins over respected grass-court players Virginie Razzano and recent Birmingham semifinalist Meilen Tu, followed by victory against 10th seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, resulting in her being the first Chinese player ever to reach any Grand Slam quarterfinal. Li rose to a new career high WTA ranking of no. 20 following the tournament, even though she ultimately lost her quarterfinal match against Kim Clijsters in two close sets. She reached the quarterfinals at Stockholm, and the fourth round at the US Open, where, as the 24th seed, she was beaten by eventual champion Maria Sharapova in two sets. She then reached the quarterfinals at the China Open, where she was beaten by Svetlana Kuznetsova, and in Guangzhou.\n\nLi started the year by participating at Tier III event in Gold Coast, Australia, where she reached the second round. The next week, she competed in Sydney. She defeated Francesca Schiavone in the first round, Elena Dementieva in the second, saving five match points, and Katarina Srebotnik in the quarterfinal. Then, she made it to the semifinals, losing a tough match to Kim Clijsters, 5–7 in the third set. However, she rose to a career high of No. 16 afterwards.\n\nLi Na followed her strong showing at the Medibank tournament with an equally strong showing at the Australian Open, where she advanced to the fourth round. Seeded 19th, Li dispatched Elena Bovina and Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets through the first two rounds, leading to a matchup with No. 9 Dinara Safina. The match was postponed due to rain, but Li handily beat Safina to advance to the fourth round to play Swiss star, No. 6 Martina Hingis. Due to a rain delay and the fact that Hingis played on Rod Laver Arena, a roofed court, on the originally scheduled day, Hingis had an extra day of rest. The match the previous day seemed to have no effect, as Li took the first set from Hingis. However, Na faded as the match went on and lost while committing 69 unforced errors. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for Li, as it marked the third straight time in a Grand Slam that she advanced at least to the fourth round.\n\nAt the Tier I Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, Li advanced to the second round, defeating Lilia Osterloh before losing to Samantha Stosur in two sets, converting zero of eleven break points. At the important Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Li made a strong showing, advancing to the semifinals. She lost to Daniela Hantuchová in the semifinal. She continued her good form at the Miami Masters, losing just three games in her first two matches against Tamira Paszek and Katarina Srebotnik, before stunning fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters in three sets. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Anna Chakvetadze.\n\nShe then moved onto the green clay of Amelia Island, where she suffered a shock second-round exit, after receiving a first round bye, to former top-20 player Karolina Šprem in straight sets. At the Family Circle Cup held in Charleston, South Carolina, she fell in the third round to Anabel Medina Garrigues. After losing in a grass tune-up event in Birmingham, Li pulled out of every tournament she was to play in the summer, including Wimbledon and the US Open, citing a rib injury.\nLi had not played a professional match in half a year and had resultantly slipped to No. 29 in the WTA rankings when she returned from her rib injury in January 2008 to compete at the 2008 Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts in Gold Coast. In the first round, she narrowly defeated seventh seed Sybille Bammer. After a comfortable second round victory over wild card Monique Adamczak, she was drawn to meet the top seed Nicole Vaidišová in the quarterfinals. Li won their encounter in straight sets, advancing to the semifinals, where she edged past Patty Schnyder.\nIn the final, she narrowly prevailed against Victoria Azarenka, not only ending her 3-year title drought (since Guangzhou 2004) but scoring her second WTA singles title of her career.\n\nDespite rising back up to world No. 24 following this victory, she then withdrew from the 2008 Medibank International in Sydney, after suffering a right knee injury. Her failure to defend her previous year's semifinal performance at this event cost her 125 ranking points, which dipped her ranking back down to No. 30 for the week beginning 14 January. Going into the 2008 Australian Open, she had a further 140 ranking points to defend from her fourth-round performance in 2007. Faced with a relatively lenient draw in the early rounds, she survived a close three-set tussle with Séverine Brémond in the first round, before surpassing Maria Elena Camerin in straight sets in round two. A revitalised Marta Domachowska remained between her and the defence of her ranking points, and although Li won the first set convincingly, she faltered thereafter and finally ceded the match to her Polish opponent by a single break of serve in the closely fought deciding set.\n\nHaving slipped three places to world No. 33 by the time she entered the Tier II tournament at Antwerp in early February, she nonetheless progressed to the semifinals with back-to-back-to-back straight-sets wins over Russian veteran Elena Likhovtseva, Slovak world No. 45 Dominika Cibulková, and on-form Swedish world No. 66 Sofia Arvidsson. However, she withered in the semifinals against world No. 47 Karin Knapp, despite having taken an early lead with a break of service in the first set, ultimately ceding the match to her Italian opponent in two sets. This tournament brought her back up within the top 30 at world No. 29.\n\nThe next week in the Tier I Qatar Open, Li met Likhovtseva again in the first round. This time, after taking the first set comfortably, she was challenged to a much tougher battle, but eventually won in three sets. In round two, she scored her second straight-sets victory in four career head-to-heads against Russian world No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze, saving a set point in the first set tie-break, before recovering to win. In the third round, she enjoyed a more comfortable victory over Israeli world No. 17 Shahar Pe'er, recovering from a 1–3 deficit in the second set. In the quarterfinals, she met her old rival and friend world No. 4 Jelena Janković, coming into the match with a winning 3–1 head-to-head record to her credit against the Serbian player. By defeating Janković she extended this record to 4–1 and moved into the semifinals, where she played Vera Zvonareva, against whom she had won both of her previous encounters. Despite taking the first set, Li lost the second by the same scoreline; and although she was 3–2 up in the final set, she then ceded four successive games to her opponent to lose the match.\n\nHer ranking having risen back to no. 23 on the strength of this performance, she was prevented from consolidating on this recovery by suffering a right knee injury, which forced her to pull out of her scheduled entries into both the Tier II event at Bangalore in early March and the Tier I tournament at Indian Wells in the middle of the month. She returned to action at the International Women's Open in Eastbourne, winning one round before losing to Nadia Petrova. She then contested Wimbledon, defeating Anastasia Rodionova before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.\n\nAt the Beijing Olympics, following early-round victories against world No. 3 Svetlana Kuznetsova, Ayumi Morita, and Kaia Kanepi, she went on to defeat one of the favourites, Venus Williams, in the quarterfinals. Li was trailing 1–4 in the first set, but managed to strengthen her game to win in straight sets. Li lost her semifinal match to sixth seed Dinara Safina and was then defeated in the bronze final by Vera Zvonareva. At the following US Open, Li was defeated by the Beijing Olympics gold medalist Elena Dementieva in the fourth round.\n\nIn the 2008 Porsche Grand Prix, the unseeded Li defeated No. 1 ranked Serena Williams in the second round in three sets. Li thus became only the second Chinese player to defeat a world No. 1 player, following Zheng Jie's victory over Ana Ivanovic at Wimbledon in 2008.\nLi withdrew from both the inaugural Brisbane International, where she was defending champion (as she won the title at Gold Coast in 2008), and the 2009 Australian Open because of a right-knee injury. She made her comeback at the Paris Open. In the first round, she beat Ágnes Szávay, but in the second round she lost to second-seeded Jelena Janković.\n\nIn the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships, Li lost to Elena Vesnina in three sets. Unseeded at the Monterrey Open, she defeated world No. 10 and top seed Agnieszka Radwańska in a first round match that lasted over two hours. In the second round, she beat Petra Cetkovská and then advanced to the semifinals after defeating Lucie Šafářová. Li then moved into her fifth career tour final, after beating sixth-seeded Iveta Benešová. However, Li lost to second-seeded Marion Bartoli in the final in straight sets. Li then played in the Premier event at Indian Wells, where she defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn, Patty Schnyder, and Amélie Mauresmo, all in straight sets, to advance to the fourth round, where she lost to eventual champion Vera Zvonareva.\n\nShe then reached the quarterfinals of the Premier event in Miami, where she beat qualifier Urszula Radwańska in the first round and upset 29th seed Aleksandra Wozniak to reach the third round, where she caused a big upset by defeating the previous week's Indian Wells champion, sixth-seeded Vera Zvonareva in three sets. This victory was particularly important for Li, as she had been beaten by Zvonareva the week before at Indian Wells. She then faced unseeded Russian Ekaterina Makarova in the fourth round and beat her in three sets to set up a quarterfinal match with the top seed and world No. 1 Serena Williams, a match which she lost in a tight three-setter. Because of her strong performance, her ranking went up to world No. 29 from world No. 40.\n\nNa's next event was the second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open in Paris. As the 25th seed, she won her first round against Polish Marta Domachowska. She then defeated Timea Bacsinszky and Olga Govortsova. She then lost to unseeded, former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the fourth round. After this impressive result, she jumped six rankings up to no. 20. She started her grass-court season as the fourth seed at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham and advanced to the final with a win over Maria Sharapova in the semifinals. However, Na was defeated by Magdaléna Rybáriková in the final. Na was seeded 19th at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. She defeated Galina Voskoboeva in the first round and Olga Govortsova in the second round, but lost to No. 11 Agnieszka Radwańska in the third round.\n\nAt the 2009 Bank of the West Classic, she lost to Serena Williams in the first round, and at the LA Women's Tennis Championships, she withdrew due to injury during her match with Urszula Radwańska of Poland. Seeded 18th at the US Open, she reached her first US Open quarterfinals, where she lost to eventual champion Kim Clijsters. En route to the quarterfinals, she defeated Ioana Raluca Olaru, Michelle Larcher de Brito, Maria Kirilenko, and Francesca Schiavone all in straight sets. Seeded 15th at the Toray Pan Pacific Open, Li won her opening match against Alizé Cornet. She then defeated Vera Dushevina before beating Kateryna Bondarenko. In the quarterfinal, she defeated Victoria Azarenka in three sets, two of which were tiebreaks where though she failed in serving for the match twice in the last set. Li lost in the semifinals to Jelena Janković, and finished the year at world No. 15, her career-high year-end ranking.\n\nLi's first tournament of 2010 was the ASB Classic in Auckland, where she was seeded second. She was defeated by Kaia Kanepi in the first round. In the Medibank International, she defeated fourth seed Caroline Wozniacki but lost to Flavia Pennetta in the second round.\n\nLi was seeded 16th at the Australian Open. She defeated world No. 4 Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round and then came from a set and 3–5 down to defeat world No. 6 Venus Williams, in her first Australian Open quarterfinal and only her third Major quarterfinal. In the semifinals, she lost to Serena Williams in two highly competitive tiebreaks. As a result of this performance, Li was the first Chinese woman ever to be ranked in the top ten of women's professional tennis.\n\nAt the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, Li, the eighth seed, defeated María José Martínez Sánchez in the second round. She then came from a 6–3, 5–2 deficit to defeat Marion Bartoli in the third round. Li was forced to retire in her quarterfinals match against Shahar Pe'er. Li continued her season at the inaugural Malaysian Open. As second seed, she fell to Tatjana Malek in the first round. As seventh seed at the BNP Paribas Open, Li fell to Elena Baltacha in the second round. Li was eighth seed at the Sony Ericsson Open, but fell to Timea Bacsinszky in the second round.\n\nAt the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, Li defeated defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round, before falling to eventual runner-up Sam Stosur in the quarterfinals. Li was 11th seed at the French Open. She fell to eventual champion and world No. 17 Francesca Schiavone in the third round. Li was seeded first at the Aegon Classic. She defeated 4th seed Aravane Rezaï in the semifinals, and 2nd seeded Maria Sharapova in the final to win the tournament. With the win, Li returned to the top 10 in the WTA rankings. Seeded seventh at the Aegon International, Li retired in the first round with a knee injury after winning the first set against Elena Baltacha. Li was seeded ninth at Wimbledon. She defeated seventh seed Agnieszka Radwańska to advance to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the second time in her career, where she lost to world No. 1 and defending champion Serena Williams. In doing so Li once again returned to the top 10 in the WTA rankings.\n\nAt the US Open, she started off as the eighth seed, but fell at the first hurdle to Kateryna Bondarenko. Li was an alternate at the WTA Championships, but did not receive a chance to play. Instead, she played at the Tournament of Champions as the first seed. However, she was defeated by Japanese Kimiko Date-Krumm in the first round, putting an end to her 2010 season, her best season to date. She finished just outside the top 10 at world No. 11. At the end of the year, Li's coach Thomas Högstedt chose to leave her in order to coach Maria Sharapova.\n\nLi played in the Medibank International Sydney as the eighth seed, making fast work of Australian wildcard Anastasia Rodionova and winning a tough three-set match against Virginie Razzano in the first two rounds. In the quarterfinals she met two-time Grand Slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova and came through with a win. She defeated surprise qualifier Bojana Jovanovski in the semifinals to advance to her eighth WTA final. Li faced world No. 3 Kim Clijsters in the final, and despite trailing 5–0 in the first set, Li went on to defeat Clijsters, capturing the fourth WTA title of her career.\n\nLi was the ninth seed at the Australian Open, where she reached her first Grand Slam singles final, the first tennis player representing an East Asian and Asian country to achieve that feat. On the way she ousted eighth seed Victoria Azarenka in straight sets. She defeated world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals to reach the final, after saving a match point in the second set. She faced No. 3 seed Kim Clijsters (whom she had defeated at the Medibank International). Although Li claimed the first set, Clijsters was able to rally back and claim the championship. Despite the loss, Li's ranking rose to a career high of world No. 7.\n\nDespite a good early start to the season, Li then had a five-match losing streak. After receiving byes into the second rounds, she lost in a hardly fought match against Yanina Wickmayer at the Dubai Tennis Championships, lucky loser Klára Zakopalová at the Qatar Ladies Open and countrywoman Peng Shuai at Indian Wells. Despite this, after Indian Wells she peaked at a career-high ranking of world No. 6 due to Janković's failures to defend her points.\n\nLi's losing streak continued, when she was upset in the Miami Masters by Johanna Larsson. With this loss, and Andy Murray's loss at Miami, both Australian Open finalists had yet to win a match since their first major final. She fell back to No. 7. Li then broke her losing streak by winning her first-round match against Anastasija Sevastova in Stuttgart. However, she lost to Sabine Lisicki in the second round. Even though she was not able to defend all her Stuttgart ranking points, she rose back to No. 6. However, due to her disappointing results, Li Na sacked her husband as coach and hired Dane Michael Mortensen.\n\nShe entered the Madrid Open as sixth seed. In the first two rounds, she defeated María José Martínez Sánchez and Iveta Benešová without much difficulty. In the third round she got the better of Roberta Vinci coming back from a set deficit. She then defeated Bethanie Mattek-Sands after recovering from a break down in the deciding set. This victory marked her first semifinals appearance in Madrid, where she lost to eventual champion Petra Kvitová.\n\nLi's resurgence continued into the Internazionali d'Italia. Seeded fourth, she received a bye in the first round. She won her opening match against Lourdes Domínguez Lino and defeated Jarmila Gajdošová and Gréta Arn in the next two rounds en route to back-to-back semifinals on clay. However, she lost to Samantha Stosur in two sets.\n\nLi won her first major title at the French Open on June 4; by doing so she made history and became the first tennis player from an East Asian and Asian country to win a Grand Slam singles event. Seeded sixth, she defeated Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová, Silvia Soler Espinosa, Sorana Cîrstea, ninth seed Petra Kvitová, fourth seed Victoria Azarenka, seventh seed Maria Sharapova, and fifth seed and defending champion Francesca Schiavone in the final, a match that was watched by 330 million viewers worldwide.\nAfter the match, Li Na was praised by the Chinese media, and her popularity throughout China was expected to grow significantly in the coming months, as she became the first Chinese national, male or female, ever to win a tennis Grand Slam title in singles, ensuring her place in the sport's history. Following the French Open, Li rose to a career high ranking of world No. 4.\n\nAs the second seed at the Aegon International, Li fell in the second round to Daniela Hantuchová. By virtue of the withdrawal of Kim Clijsters, Li was the third seed at Wimbledon, her highest seeding at a Grand Slam. She beat Alla Kudryavtseva in the first round but lost in the second round to eventual semifinalist Sabine Lisicki of Germany even though she had two match points at 5–3 and served for the match twice at 5–4 and 6–5. Li suffered a surprise knock-out at the 2011 US Open at the hands of 53rd ranked Romanian teen Simona Halep and she ended the coaching of Mortensen. Then at the China Open, Li suffered a first round defeat by Romanian player Monica Niculescu. However, as a result of Vera Zvonareva and Samantha Stosur's inability to go past the third round, she was able to qualify for the 2011 WTA Tour Championships for the first time in her career.\n\nLi made her debut appearance at the WTA Championships in Istanbul. She was drawn in the White Group along with Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur. She beat Sharapova in her opening match but lost her other two matches, failing to make the semifinals. She finished the year as the world No. 5 after a memorable yet very inconsistent season. Li Na was nominated for two ESPY Sports Award categories: the \"Annual Breakthrough Award\" and \"Annual Award for best female tennis players\". She lost to Blake Griffin and Serena Williams, respectively. On 17 and 18 December, Li participated in the Li Na & Friends Tennis Exhibition 2011 in Wuhan, China.\n\nLi started her 2012 season in the Hopman Cup with countryman Wu Di, who was also from Hubei Province, where she won all three single rubbers against Marion Bartoli, Anabel Medina Garrigues and Jarmila Gajdošová. It was her first win over Anabel Medina Garrigues in four meetings. It was a return to her form after being plagued by losses and early round exits in almost all her tournaments during the second half of 2011 following her Roland Garros triumph. Li then played in the Sydney to defend her title. She defeated Ekaterina Makarova, Chanelle Scheepers and Lucie Šafářová to reach the semifinals. In the semifinal, she came back from one set down to eke out the win against world No. 2 Petra Kvitová, the favorite to win the tournament. In the final, Li failed to defend her title, losing the match to Victoria Azarenka in three sets.\n\nLi began her Australian Open campaign by cruising through the early rounds of the tournament, dispatching Ksenia Pervak, Olivia Rogowska, and Anabel Medina Garrigues (after Garrigues retired due to an injured ankle), en route to meeting her 2011 Australian Open final conqueror Kim Clijsters in the fourth round. Kim Clijsters rolled her ankle at 3–3 and Li took the first set comfortably. Li held four match points at 6–2 in the second set tiebreak, but dropped six consecutive points to give Clijsters the second set due to unforced errors and poor shot selection. At 1–5 in the final set, Li began a resurgence by reeling off the next three games to close the gap to 4–5, but the Belgian managed to close out the match. Her unexpected loss left her in tears in her post-match press conference.\n\nAfter the disappointing Australian Open campaign, Li participated in the 2012 Fed Cup and won all three of her matches on home soil. She defeated Kei-Chen Changand and Nigina Abduraimova during the round robin stages to push China to the promotional play-offs against Kazakhstan. She next played Galina Voskoboeva and won in three sets. This win sealed the tie and secured China's spot in the World Group II play-offs.\nLi then participated in the Open GDF Suez in Paris, but retired against Tsvetana Pironkova in the first round of the tournament due to a back injury she sustained during her Fed Cup matches. She made back-to-back quarterfinal appearances at the BNP Paribas Open and Sony Ericsson Open. At the BNP Paribas Open, Li got a first round bye and faced a rematch with Galina Voskoboeva in the second round, which she won in three sets. Li recorded her first win over Zheng Jie, after losing the five earlier meetings. In the fourth round she comfortably won against Klára Zakopalová, who was on a roll, upsetting Vera Zvonareva and Daniela Hantuchová. In the quarterfinals she faced Angelique Kerber and lost in two sets. At the Sony Ericsson Open after receiving a first round bye, Li defeated Melinda Czink, Iveta Benešová, and Sabine Lisicki to secure a spot in the quarterfinals. Li's win over Lisicki avenged her loss to the big serving German in the previous year's second round of the Wimbledon Championships. Li lost to world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, her first in their last four meetings, where the Chinese beat the Russian all in straight sets.\n\nLi reached the final of the 2012 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, defeating Iveta Benešová, Chanelle Scheepers and Dominika Cibulková without dropping a set before receiving a walkover from Serena Williams in the semifinals. In the final she lost to Maria Sharapova in three thriller sets despite being a set up and leading 4–0 in the second and failing to convert a championship point in the final set. Li was seeded 7th at the French Open, where she was the defending champion. She began her title defence by defeating Sorana Cîrstea, Stéphanie Foretz Gacon and Christina McHale in the first three rounds before suffering a fourth round upset bid by qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova. She fell out of the world top ten due to her French Open result. Li lost to Sorana Cîrstea in the second round of Wimbledon – her first loss against the Romanian.\n\nAt the 2012 London Olympics, Li, seeded 10th, crashed out in the first round to Slovakian Daniela Hantuchová. Her poor performance caused her to drop out of the world top ten for the second time in the year following the conclusion of the Games. After the Olympics, Li announced that she and Carlos Rodríguez, coach of former world No. 1 and seven-time major winner Justine Henin, have commenced a coaching relationship.\n\nLi's next tournament was the Rogers Cup, where she made it all the way to the final. She received a first round bye before seeing off home crowd favourite Eugenie Bouchard in the second round. In the third round, she fended off world No. 9 Sara Errani and ended the hopes of Agnieszka Radwańska rising to No. 1 in the rankings by beating her in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Li rallied to come back from a 5–1 deficit in the third set to overcome Lucie Šafářová before losing to Petra Kvitová in the final. After the tournament she returned to the world top ten at No. 9.\n\nAt the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, Li had a first round bye before eliminating Sorana Cîrstea in the second round, avenging her loss to the Romanian in the second round of the Wimbledon Championships. In the third round Li proved to be too strong for Johanna Larsson and in the quarterfinals she convincingly defeated world No. 3 and top seed Agnieszka Radwańska in a match where Li only surrendered two games. She then edged Venus Williams in the semifinal (bringing their head to head to 3–0), before defeating fifth seed Angelique Kerber in the final; her fifth win against Kerber in six matches. This was her first title since the 2011 French Open and the sixth WTA title in her career. By winning this tournament, she moved up one place in the rankings to world No. 8.\n\nAt the US Open, Li cruised through the first two rounds with easy wins over Heather Watson and Casey Dellacqua. However, her tournament run came to an abrupt end in the next round, when she upset in three sets by rising British teenager Laura Robson, who had defeated three-time champion Kim Clijsters in the previous round. This result meant that this was her first season since 2008 in which she failed to reach the quarterfinal stage at a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nLi then travelled to Tokyo to participate in the Pan Pacific Open. She received a bye in the first round, and won her second round match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to book a meeting with former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the third round. She won the first set, but eventually lost the match. Her exit from the tournament meant that her chances of participating in the upcoming 2012 WTA Tour Championships depended on her performance at the China Open. Li won the first round match against Francesca Schiavone. In the second round she recorded her first victory against Russian Nadia Petrova after six previous losses, who was coming off a title run at the Pan Pacific Open a week ago. She played compatriot Peng Shuai in the third round for a place in the quarters and emerged victorious in a topsy-turvy three set match lasting 2 hours and 28 minutes. In the quarterfinals, she faced defending champion Agnieszka Radwańska and played some high-quality tennis to defeat her for the third time this season. She lost her semifinal to Maria Sharapova; the Russian reeling off eight consecutive games to take the match. With this performance, she became the eighth and final player to qualify for the season-ending championships.\n\nFor the 2012 WTA Tour Championships, Li was placed in the red group along with Victoria Azarenka, Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber. She played Serena Williams in her opening match and lost in two sets after failing to capatalise on her 4–1 first set lead. She defeated Angelique Kerber in her second match before losing to Azarenka in her third match; in the latter match, she had served for the first set at 5–4, but was broken and lost the set in a tie-break. This was the final match of her 2012 season, finishing the year ranked world No. 7.\n\nOn 29 December 2012, Li beat Victoria Azarenka in an annual exhibition event in Hua Hin, Thailand.\n\nLi commenced her season at the first edition of the Shenzhen Open. She cruised to the final with straight-sets defeats over Mandy Minella, Julia Cohen, Bojana Jovanovski and Peng Shuai, putting her in prime position to claim her seventh WTA title. Li saw off 5th seed Klára Zakopalová in three sets in the final to claim her first title of 2013 and seventh of her career.\n\nLi next played at the Apia International, at which she made consecutive finals the two previous years, winning in 2011. She was pushed to the limit by Christina McHale but had little trouble with Ayumi Morita. She met young American Madison Keys in the quarterfinals who proved to be a tougher challenge, with Li prevailing in three tight sets to book a semifinal showdown with world No. 4, Agnieszka Radwańska. Li looked the winner in the early stages of the match, but somewhat faltered, producing a high number of unforced errors which handed Radwańska the first set. She saved four match points on Radwańska's serve in the ninth game of the second set and three on her own serve in the tenth game. However, eventually she succumbed to the pressure and a half-volley into the net sealed the win for Radwańska in an hour and 32 minutes, putting an end to Li's Sydney reign.\n\nAt the Australian Open Li easily stormed through to the quarterfinals, where she faced world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, who had not dropped a set during a 13-match winning streak. Li became the first player to defeat her this season and advanced to the semifinals where she ousted world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets, who had only dropped a record-low nine games in the tournament. This marked Li's second Australian Open final appearance in three years, finishing runner-up to Kim Clijsters in 2011. In the final, Li was hampered by injuries, falling over on two occasions. The first of which occurred at 1–3 in the second set, a fall that saw Li incur a 10-minute medical timeout. She fell over a second time after the Australia Day fireworks break, not only twisting her left ankle once more but also heavily knocking the rear of her head on the court, causing a momentary black-out. Despite being severely hindered in her movement, she continued playing but eventually lost the match in three sets to Victoria Azarenka.\n\nThe left ankle injury she sustained in the Australian Open decider forced her to withdraw from subsequent tournaments including the Qatar Total Open, the Indian Wells Masters, plus an exhibition match at the BNP Paribas Showdown in Hong Kong in which she was scheduled to play former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nAfter being sidelined for seven weeks, Li made a return to the competition at the Miami Masters as the fifth seed. After a first round bye, she won her second round against Kiki Bertens in two quick sets without dropping serve in her first match since the Australian Open final. Next up she faced Varvara Lepchenko and Garbiñe Muguruza and defeated both in straight sets to set up a quarterfinal match against world No. 1 Serena Williams. Despite leading 5–2 in the second set and holding a set point on Williams' serve, she did not manage to find a way to capitalise and went on to lose the match in a tiebreak.\n\nLi's next tournament was the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, the first major clay-court event of the season. As the second seed, she received a bye in the first round. She swept past qualifier Mirjana Lučić-Baroni in the second round, setting up an encounter with Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinals. She disposed of Kvitová and then surprise semifinalist Bethanie Mattek-Sands both in straight sets to advance to the final for the first time, seeking her eighth career title. The final was a contest between her and Maria Sharapova, whose passage to the final included three three-set matches each lasting over three hours. She, however, handily defeated Li in just over 90 minutes, increasing her clay-court winning streak to 16 and avenging her Australian Open semifinal loss to Li earlier in the year.\n\nLi was then stunned by lucky loser Madison Keys in the first round of the Madrid Open the following week, her first early tournament exit of the season. Li returned to the Italian Open as the defending finalist. After a first round bye, she defeated Zheng Jie in straight sets then squared off with former doubles partner Jelena Janković, who defeated Li in a marathon match in which Li's inconsistency proved to her be undoing, committing 62 unforced errors. As one of the favourites, Li's quest for a second Grand Slam title began when she played Anabel Medina Garrigues in the opening round of Roland Garros, winning in two sets. Her struggles on clay continued, however, as she fell victim to Bethanie Mattek-Sands, ranked 67th, in a rain-interrupted second round match – losing in three sets, bringing her disappointing clay court season to a close.\n\nLi got her grass court season off to a winning start by beating Alizé Cornet in the first round of the Aegon International, at which she was seeded second. A quarterfinal berth against Elena Vesnina was secured after her second round opponent Marion Bartoli pulled out due to a viral illness. The Russian ended Li's run and went on to win the tournament.\n\nLi was the sixth seed at Wimbledon. She defeated Michaëlla Krajicek in the first round and Simona Halep in a rollercoaster three set match. In the third round against the No. 32 seed Klára Zakopalová, Li lost the first set, but won the match in three sets after Zakopalová failed to serve out the match. In the fourth round she dispatched Roberta Vinci to secure a spot in the last eight for the third time. After the match, she revealed that the secret to her success was the slice practice that her husband Jiang Shan gave her prior to the match. In her quarterfinal clash with Agnieszka Radwańska, she was leading 5–4 in the first set and was a set point up when she hit an ace that was wrongly called out. Li didn't challenge the call, and lost the set in a tiebreak where she was also leading 5–3. She mounted a comeback to win the second set, coming from 4–2 down. A brief rain delay halted proceedings at the beginning of the third. When play resumed, it was Radwańska who raced to a 5–2 lead. Li saved eight match points, but eventually lost the 2 hour 47 minute match.\nLi then competed at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, at which she made the final last year. After enjoying a bye in the first round, she defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in two easy sets, followed by hard-fought wins over in-form players Ana Ivanovic (in a final set tie-break, after surviving 2–5) and Dominika Cibulková to reach the semifinals, where she lost to Sorana Cîrstea. At the Western & Southern Open, she notched wins over Lauren Davis and Angelique Kerber before receiving a walkover from Agnieszka Radwańska in the quarterfinals after the Pole pulled out due to personal reasons. In her semifinal against Serena Williams she was broken when serving for both sets and was beaten by the eventual champion.\n\nSeeded fifth at the US Open, she defeated Olga Govortsova and Sofia Arvidsson in straight sets and then got revenge on Laura Robson in the third round, the same stage where Robson defeated her last year. She then breezed past former world No. 1 Jelena Janković in straight sets. Upon defeating Janković, she reached the quarterfinals of the US Open for only the second time in her career. There she beat Ekaterina Makarova to reach her first US Open semifinal (as well as it being the first time a Chinese woman made the US Open semifinals) before Serena Williams again ended her run in straight sets, needing six match points to do so.\n\nShe then headed to Beijing to take part in the 2013 China Open as the home crowd favourite, defeating Daniela Hantuchová, Bojana Jovanovski and Sabine Lisicki in straight sets before falling to Petra Kvitová in the quarterfinals.\n\nOn 27 September, Li successfully qualified for the 2013 WTA Tour Championships, as the fifth qualifier. She won all three of her round robin matches against Sara Errani, Jelena Janković and Victoria Azarenka, thus qualifying for the semifinals for the first time. Upon beating Petra Kvitová her ranking rose to a new career high of world No. 3, the highest-ever ranking for a female tennis player from an East Asian and Asian country and overtaking Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwańska. In the final she made a strong start, blasting 10 winners en route to winning the first set against Serena Williams, but ran out of gas at three-all in the second, losing nine games in a row to lose the match.\n\nLi started her 2014 season as the defending champion at the Shenzhen Open. She defeated wild-card and former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva in the first round, Nadiia Kichenok in the second round, Monica Niculescu in the quarterfinals and Annika Beck in the semifinals to reach her first final of the year and setting up the second all-Chinese final in WTA history in the process, where she defeated Peng Shuai in straight sets to win her eighth career singles title. This marked the first time in Li's career where she had successfully defended a title of any kind.\n\nAt the Australian Open, Li competed as the fourth seed. She made quick work of current junior top-2 players Ana Konjuh and Belinda Bencic in the first two rounds. Having lost the first set against Lucie Šafářová, she fended off a match point when trailing 5–6 in the second before rebounding in the tiebreak and decisive set to avoid the upset. She then cruised past Ekaterina Makarova, Flavia Pennetta, and Eugenie Bouchard to reach her third Australian Open final, where she defeated first-time Grand Slam singles finalist and 20th seed Dominika Cibulková in straight sets to claim her first Australian Open title, thus becoming the first East Asian and Asian Australian Open champion and fourth woman to win the title after being match point down.\n\nLi extended her winning streak to thirteen consecutive matches by defeating Magdaléna Rybáriková in her opener at the Qatar Open. She then suffered her first loss of the season to qualifier Petra Cetkovská in a tight three set contest in the third round. After the tournament, Li reached a new career high singles ranking of world No. 2.\n\nLi's next scheduled event was the BNP Paribas Open, where she was unable to compete the previous year due to injury. Seeded first at a Premier Mandatory event for the first time, she received a bye in the first round before registering straight set victories over countrywoman Zheng Jie, Karolína Plíšková and Aleksandra Wozniak en route to a quarterfinal clash with Dominika Cibulková, a rematch of the Australian Open final. Though Li committed 54 unforced errors, she prevailed in three sets and faced Flavia Pennetta in the semifinals. There, she was upset in straight sets by the 20th-seeded Italian and eventual champion.\n\nAt the Sony Open Tennis, Li received a first round bye and walkover in the second round due to the withdrawal of Alisa Kleybanova. Li defeated Madison Keys, Carla Suárez Navarro and Caroline Wozniacki en route to a semifinal against Dominika Cibulková, who was projected to make her top 10 debut with her previous win over Agnieszka Radwańska. Li improved her perfect record against the Slovakian to 7–0 and booked her place in her first Premier Mandatory final. In a final featuring the world's top-2 players, Li raced to a 5–2 lead in the first set and wasted a set point, before her opponent world No. 1 Serena Williams rallied to steal the set 7–5. Li only managed to win a single game in the second set, meekly surrendering the title.\n\nFollowing a 21–3 start to the season, Li was forced out of the 2014 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix due to a left knee injury, where she was the finalist in 2013. She started her clay court campaign at the Madrid Open, where she recorded wins over Kirsten Flipkens and Zheng Jie in the first two rounds. Li then battled past Sloane Stephens in three sets, and was again involved in a narrow three setter in her quarterfinal against Maria Sharapova, eventually succumbing to the Russian after taking the first set comfortably. At the 2014 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Li beat Australians Casey Dellacqua (for her 500th career win) and Sam Stosur, before suffering her first loss to Sara Errani in the quarterfinals. After the match, Li told reporters that she had vomited less than 20 minutes prior to stepping onto the court due to food poisoning. At the French Open, she was upset by French youngster Kristina Mladenovic in the opening round. This was also Li's earliest loss in the tournament. Li's first round loss contributed to three negative tennis records. Due to fellow 2014 Australian Open men's champion Stanislas Wawrinka losing in the first round as well, it was the first time in the history of tennis that the reigning Grand Slam winners were ousted in the opening round of their next major. Due to number one seed Serena Williams losing in the second round, it was the first time in Open Era history that the top two seeded women have lost before the third round at any Grand Slam tournament. After No. 3 seed Agnieszka Radwańska lost in the third round, it was also the first time in the Open Era that none of the top-3 seeds advanced past the third round.\n\nLi chose not to play a warm-up event before the third Grand Slam of the season got underway. Her dip in form continued at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, where she was eliminated in the third round by Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová, having beaten Paula Kania and Yvonne Meusburger in the first and second rounds, respectively. In July, Li and coach Rodríguez parted ways.\n\nHaving not played since Wimbledon due to a left knee injury which required surgery, Li announced her retirement from professional tennis on 19 September 2014. She ended her career ranked world No. 6 by the Women's Tennis Association. That year she was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25.\n\nAs the most successful East Asian, and Asian tennis player ever, Li has become one of the most well-known and marketable athletes in the world. In 2013, Li appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, which named her to its annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World; Li being one of only four athletes to be named on the list. Former world No. 1 Chris Evert writes: \"Tennis has exploded in China. The country now has some 15 million tennis players; 116 million watched Li win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to our sport, and it never would have happened without Li. At tournaments, I've seen her charm the crowds. When she smiles, everyone melts. She's just such a breath of fresh air. Her friendly on-court demeanour as well as her hilariously-witty post-match interviews brings a smile to everyone's face.\" Li also appeared on the cover of 26 May 2014 edition of \"Time\" magazine, which featured an article titled \"The Passion of Li Na\", in which author Hannah Beech described Li as a world class sports idol, inspiring millions of Chinese people to regard her as an icon of pursuing independent character and freedom of thought. In 2012, \"Forbes\" listed Li as No. 85 in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Li, along with the fellow tennis players Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, were the only three female athletes who cracked the Top 100 earning list. Li was ranked No. 5 and No.8 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Li is affectionately called \"Big Sister Na\" () among Chinese communities and is considered a \"strong, unbending and unyielding\" role model. She has not only become a household name across China but a global icon, with her Sina Weibo microblogging having over 23 million followers as of October 2014. Her perceived rebelliousness, exemplified by the rose tattoo on her chest and her previous run-ins with government sports programs, also helped boost her popularity. On 15 April 2015, Li received the Laureus Academy Exceptional Achievement award at the Laureus World Sports Awards held in Shanghai. She was also a nominee for the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year award, alongside Serena Williams.\n\nNike was Li's clothing and footwear sponsor for many years, dating back to her early tennis career. Li used Babolat Pure Drive GT rackets. In 2009, Li was signed by IMG. She rose to fame after her Roland Garros triumph, and since had signed seven endorsements in multiple-year terms. Her agent, Max Eisenbud, also managed to negotiate a deal allowing Li to wear other sponsors' patches on her Nike tennis shirt, something not usually permitted by the sportswear giant.\n\nLi was an aggressive baseliner whose game was founded upon her quick reflexes, athleticism and powerful groundstrokes that achieved precision, placement and depth. Li's crosscourt forehand tended to be her favourite shot, hit with great accuracy and pace, although her backhand was said to be the more consistent and reliable groundstroke, both of which she was known to unleash unpredictably to all areas of the court to dictate play. She boasted an exceptional backhand down-the-line, which was very effective at producing winners or setting up a weak reply from the opponent. Many tennis analysts considered Li one of the cleanest and hardest hitting players on tour, capable of overpowering and outgunning opponents from the baseline. Although she did not possess an overwhelmingly powerful serve, it was very well placed, earning her aces or unreturnables on occasion, however it often became a liability when she lost confidence under pressure, resulting in many double faults. Li employed a solid defensive game combining great footwork, speed and lateral movement. Her ability to turn defense into offense was one of her biggest assets as she hit well on the run and scrambled around the court with ease. Having been an accomplished doubles player, she was comfortable when playing at the net, often moving forward to take advantage of a short ball or finish off an extended rally. Li's inconsistency was cited as her main weakness throughout her career, as she was prone to streaky and erratic play accompanied by a high unforced error count. Since her shots were usually hit hard and flat with minimal topspin or slice, her game lacked variety. Her emotions on court have hurt her game during tight moments. Under the tutelage of Carlos Rodríguez, Li adopted more of an all-round game, implementing a forehand with additional topspin and frequent net approaches into her arsenal, as well as improved consistency, mental stability, mobility and coordination.\n\nLi Na had a see-saw rivalry with Maria Sharapova, with the latter winning their first five matches dating back to 2005, including Li's Grand Slam debut at the 2005 Australian Open. Li won her first match against Sharapova in the 2009 Birmingham semifinals, starting a series of four consecutive wins against Sharapova. Li beat Sharapova again in Birmingham in 2010, this time in the final, and in the semifinals of the 2011 French Open, on her way to winning her maiden Grand Slam. At the Year-end Championships later that year, Li defeated Sharapova in the round robin stage. In 2012, Li and Sharapova met three times, with Sharapova winning all three of their matches, the most notable being the final of the clay-court tournament in Rome. Li won the first set and looked headed for victory when she went 4–0 up in the second due to an effectively aggressive gameplan which saw her take 15 of 17 points. With victory nearing Li suddenly saw her accuracy shatter and 24 unforced errors let Sharapova back into the match to eventually take a three set win over Li. They met again in the 2013 Australian Open semifinals, where Li achieved her most notable victory over Sharapova, winning in straight sets and giving up just four games (Sharapova had lost just nine entering the match). A few months later at the 2013 Porsche Grand Prix Tennis in Stuttgart, Sharapova defended her title by defeating Li in the final. The pair was involved in another three set battle in the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open quarterfinals, where Sharapova eventually triumphed even though Li was up a set and a break. Sharapova led Li in the head-to-head 10–5.\n\nLi and Agnieszka Radwańska first played each other in 2009. Li led the head-to-head 6–5. After their first four matches in 2009 and 2010 the head-to-head was even at 2–2. This included a victory each at the Wimbledon Championships; Radwańska winning in 2009 and Li in 2010. In 2012 Li and Radwańska met 4 times, with Li taking 3 victories. Li lost their meeting in the Stuttgart quarter-final in three sets, but dominated in Montréal, Cincinnati and Beijing. Li prevented Radwańska from taking the world No. 1 ranking off Victoria Azarenka with the first two victories, whilst she also ended her title defence in Beijing, securing the eighth and final place in the year-end championships in the process.\n\nIn 2013 both won the first tournament they entered. They were both undefeated when they met each other in the semifinals of their second tournament of the year at Sydney. Radwańska beat Li and eventually won the tournament. This was Li's first defeat of 2013, while Radwańska remained unbeaten. In the 2013 Australian Open quarterfinals, Li handed Radwańska her first loss of the season. They met again at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, with Radwańska eking out a close three set win.\n\nLi and Kim Clijsters formed a well-known rivalry, having met eight times between 2006 and 2012. Clijsters won their head-to-head 6–2, including 4–0 at Grand Slams. Li's maiden Grand Slam quarterfinal was at Wimbledon in 2006 in which she was defeated by the second-seeded Clijsters in straight sets. Li's second Grand Slam quarterfinal was at the 2009 US Open, and again it was against Clijsters, who had recently launched a comeback after starting a family, who prevailed in straight sets.\n\nOne of Li's two wins against Clijsters came in the final of the 2011 Sydney International. Li had trailed 0–5 in the first set before coming back to win the set in a tiebreak en route to complete a remarkable straight-sets victory and deny Clijsters a third Sydney title. They would meet again only two weeks later, in the final of the 2011 Australian Open, a match which had historical proportions because Li would have become the first player from an Asian country to win a Grand Slam singles title or Clijsters would win her first non-US Open Grand Slam title. Both players came into the match having defeated the world's top two players in the semifinals: Li over Caroline Wozniacki and Clijsters over Vera Zvonareva. After Li took the first set, she proceeded to lose the next two, giving Clijsters her only Australian Open title.\n\nThe pair met again at the same tournament twelve months later, this time in the fourth round. Similar to the previous year's final, Li won the first set before eventually losing in three sets; this time around she had held four match points in the second-set tiebreak.\n\nList of all matches\n\nLi and Victoria Azarenka met eleven times between 2008 and 2013. Azarenka led the head-to-head 6–5 overall, and 2–1 in championship matches, but Li led 2–1 in Grand Slam matches.\n\nTheir first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts tournament (which has since been renamed the Brisbane International), which Li Na won in three sets after Azarenka had won the first. Azarenka's first victory over Li was in the third round of the 2010 Rogers Cup. They met three times in 2011, two of which were at Grand Slams, with Li winning on both occasions, before Azarenka won their third meeting at the 2011 WTA Tour Championships, en route to reaching the final.\n\nThey met a further three times in 2012, with Azarenka winning each time. They met in the final of the Sydney International, where the Belarusian won in three sets after breaking the defending champion Li at 4–3 in the decider. Azarenka was also victorious in their meetings at Madrid and the year-end championships.\n\nTheir most notable meeting to date was in the final of the 2013 Australian Open. Both players entered the championship match with one Grand Slam title each (Azarenka won the 2012 Australian Open, whilst Li won the 2011 French Open), and in very good form, with Azarenka only conceding one set during the tournament and Li not having dropped a set and also having defeated two top-4 players (Agnieszka Radwańska and Maria Sharapova) en route. After Li won the first set, she suffered serious head and ankle injuries and eventually lost in three sets.\n\nTheir last meeting at the 2013 WTA Tour Championships was a lopsided affair, with Li recording a straight sets win and losing just three games in the process.\n\n\n"}

The U.S.'s first nuclear power plant (the Shippingport Reactor) had gone on line a year earlier. Peach Bottom Unit 1 was an experimental helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor. It operated from 1966 to 1974. The other two units, General Electric boiling water reactors, placed on-line in 1974, are still in operation on the 620-acre (2.5 km) site. Both Units 2 and 3, originally rated at 3,514 megawatts thermal (MW), equivalent to about 1,180 megawatts of electricity (MW) each, were uprated to 4,016 megawatts thermal (MW), equivalent to about 1,382 megawatts net of electricity (MW) each in 2018. Their licenses were until 2033 (Unit 2) and 2034 (Unit 3), but were extended by 20 years to 2053 and 2054 (respectively) in 2020.\n\nPeach Bottom is operated by Exelon and is jointly owned by Exelon (50%) and Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) Power LLC (50%).\n\nPeach Bottom was one of the plants analyzed in the NUREG-1150 safety analysis study.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Peach Bottom was 46,536, an increase of 7.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 5,526,343, an increase of 10.6 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Baltimore (36 miles to city center).\n\nIn 1987, PECO was ordered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to indefinitely shutdown Peach Bottom-2 and -3 on March 31 due to operator misconduct, corporate malfeasance and blatant disregard for the health and safety of the area. Infamously, operators were found sleeping on the job, playing video games, engaging in rubber band and paper ball fights, and reading unauthorized material.\n\nAmong the incidents cited by the NRC: security guards were overworked, one guard was found asleep on the job, 36,000 gallons of \"mildly radioactive water\" leaked into the Susquehanna River, PECO mislaid data on radioactive waste classification causing misclassification of a waste shipment, and a major fire occurred in the maintenance cage of the Unit 3 turbine building on March 4, 1987.\n\nBlame was not simply placed on the operators. \"Latent organizational weakness\" was targeted by industry experts and regulators alike. INPO President Zack Pate came to the conclusion that \"Major changes in the corporate culture at PECO are required.\" In September 1988, NRC Chairman Lando Zech told senior management officials of PECO, \"Your operators certainly made mistakes, no question about that. Your corporate management problems are just as serious.\" Clearly, a culture characterized by low morale and apathy prevailed. By April 1988, this emphasis on mismanagement contributed to the President of PECO resigning as well as to the retirement of the CEO.\n\nRobert P. Crosby became the primary Organization Development influence during the PECO Nuclear turnaround following the Peach Bottom shut down. He used The Interpersonal Gap model by John L. Wallen along with a unique T-group method known as Conflict Management (and later as \"Tough Stuff\" in other business applications) to speed culture change, and applied his own version of Daryl Conner's Sponsor Agent Target model to improving and shortening outage management.\n\nBy 1996, both Limerick and Peach Bottom were designated excellent by INPO, and given strong Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) ratings by the NRC.\n\nIn 1999, PECO Nuclear eliminated their Organization Development positions as part of cost cutting initiative.\nTrouble arose again in September 2007, when former employee Kerry Beal videotaped Peach Bottom security guards sleeping on the job. Beal had previously tried to notify supervisors at Wackenhut Corp. and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He was eventually fired during the Exelon security transition, a decision which made a list of the 101 \"dumbest moments in business\" in the January 16, 2008 issue of \"Fortune\".\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Peach Bottom was 1 in 41,667; according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\n"}

It is capital of a separate gmina (municipality) called Gmina Kurów, within Lublin Voivodeship. The village has 2,817 inhabitants ().\n\nKurów was probably firstly mentioned in the \"Gesta principum Polonorum\" of Gall Anonim as \"castrum Galli\", what is interpreted as the \"Castle of the Kurowie\". The earliest historical mention of Kurów comes from a document issued in 1185, which mentions a church dedicated to Saint Giles already existing in the place. Sometime between 1431 and 1442 the village was granted city rights based on the Magdeburg Law. As a private town, it was the centre for the trade in food from the surrounding area. Several fur and leather factories were also located here. In the 16th century, Kurów was one of the centres of Calvinism, since many of the Polish Brethren settled there. By 1660, most of the inhabitants had converted to Arianism. At that time, Kurów was one of the most important urban centers of Lublin Voivodeship, one of three voivodeships of historic Lesser Poland.\n\nAfter 1660, the town shares its history with the rest of the region. In 1795, after the third partition of Poland, Kurów was annexed by Austria. In 1809, it became part of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, Kurów became part of the Kingdom of Poland. During the November Uprising, in February 1831, the minor Battle of Kurów took place, when the Polish forces under general Józef Dwernicki defeated a Russian army. In 1870, a few years after the January Uprising, the town finally lost its city charter, which has not yet been regained. Since 1918, Kurów was once more part of Poland.\n\nOn September 9, 1939, during the Polish Defensive War, which is the name in Poland for the start of World War II, the town was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe. Among the targets destroyed was a civilian hospital (marked with red crosses), where many victims perished. During World War II, Germany set up two slave labour camps in the town. In 1942, a minor ghetto was established. However, most of the Poles imprisoned in Kurów escaped and joined the Polish Home Army units operating from the nearby forests.\n\nAlmost 2,000 Jews lived in Kurów when the Second World War began. The Jewish population of Kurów came to end with the war and the slaughter that ensued. The Germans bombed the synagogue, from the air, they machine gunned the people fleeing the bombing. The Jews attempted to set up their lives to live under the domination of the German regime but there was no way to accommodate it. Many of the Jews ran to the forests and attempted to take shelter there but the Polish partisans killed them for any reason; for their shoes, for their weapons or just because they were Jews. Many times, the Polish population helped the Jews, even risking their own lives. Thanks to Mieczysław Kutnik, Adam Turczyk or Wacław Mańko several Jews survived the war. A greater portion of the Jewish population were transported to Sobibor where they were murdered outright. Just a few of the Kurów Jews managed to survive the selections of the first days in that camp and those Jews were able to help organize and execute the revolt in Sobibor which resulted in the destruction of the camp by the Germans themselves. A number of Jewish Kurovites were decorated by the Russians for their valor as partisans during the war.\n\nThose who were successful were hiding in Garbów forests, where a Jewish partisan unit was active, headed by Kaim Elizer Wurman.\n\nMany former Jewish residents of Kurów emigrated to America, Israel, Argentina, France before World War II and other points elsewhere, wherever they could find refuge. There was a Kurów burial society in New York.\n\n\nThe S12 and S17 expressways run through the north of Kurów since 2013, allowing Lublin–Warsaw traffic to bypass the village.\n\n\n"}

The rail link is fully underground, lies along the south-west coastline of Kowloon Peninsula, east of rail tracks of the Tung Chung line and Airport Express. Kowloon Southern Link has one underground intermediate station called Austin station (formerly West Kowloon station). It is located adjacent to the Canton Road Government Offices, close to Kowloon station of Tung Chung line and Airport Express. However, the structures do not provide a direct transfer between the two stations.\n\nThe project was originally proposed and carried out by Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) to link the KCR West Rail that terminated at Nam Cheong Station to the KCR East Rail at Hung Hom Station. The tracks between Hung Hom and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station had opened in 2004, to alleviate surface traffic jams and congestion at Kowloon Tong Station caused by passengers transferring between the KCR East Rail and the MTR.\n\nThe initial plans included an additional intermediate station: Canton Road Station, to serve the adjacent shopping centres. The station was eventually omitted from the project due to failed negotiations between the rail operator and property developers, the outcome being officially announced on 6 December 2004.\n\nConstruction of the Kowloon Southern Link began in late 2005 by the KCRC, after the company's network was taken over by MTR Corporation (MTRC) on 2 December 2007, the project was continued by MTRC. The link went into service on 16 August 2009.\n\nUpon the completion of the rail link, the West Rail Line assumed the tracks from the East Tsim Sha Tsui to Hung Hom portion of the East Rail Line. At the same time both the East Rail and West Rail Lines were altered to terminate at Hung Hom Station, with the platform and tracks at Hung Hom being rearranged to provide cross-platform interchange between the two lines (it will form two sets of island platforms).\n\nUpon the opening of the extension, a new Tuen Mun-Hung Hom Monthly Pass was introduced for unlimited rides of the whole West Rail line (including the new extension).

{"id": "1800787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800787", "title": "1964 Republican National Convention", "text": "1964 Republican National Convention\n\nThe 1964 National Convention of the Republican Party of the United States took place in the Cow Palace, Daly City, California, from July 13 to July 16, 1964. Before 1964, there had been only one national Republican convention on the West Coast, the 1956 Republican National Convention, which also took place in the Cow Palace. Many believed that a convention at San Francisco indicated the rising power of the Republican party in the west.\n\nThe Republican primaries of 1964 featured liberal Nelson Rockefeller of New York and conservative Barry Goldwater of Arizona as the two leading candidates. Shortly before the California primary, Rockefeller's wife, whom he had just married the previous year soon after divorcing his previous wife, gave birth; this drew renewed attention to his family life which hurt his popularity among conservatives and helped Goldwater win the primary. An anti-Goldwater organization called for the nomination of former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, but the effort failed. Although former President Dwight Eisenhower only reluctantly supported Goldwater after he won the nomination, former President Herbert Hoover gave him enthusiastic endorsement. By the end of the primaries, Goldwater's nomination was secure.\n\nSenator Margaret Chase Smith's name was entered for nomination at the Convention, the first time a woman's name was entered for nomination at a major party convention.\n\nIt was the only Republican convention between 1952 and 2008 that failed to feature Richard Nixon, Bob Dole or a Bush on the ticket.\n\nThe Republican National Convention of 1964 was a tension-filled contest. Goldwater's conservatives were openly clashing with Rockefeller's moderates. Goldwater was regarded as the \"conservatives' leading spokesman.\" As a result, Goldwater was not as popular with the moderates and liberals of the Republican Party. When Rockefeller attempted to deliver a speech, he was booed by the convention's conservative delegates, who regarded him as a member of the \"eastern liberal establishment.\" Despite the infighting, Goldwater was easily nominated. He chose William E. Miller, a Representative from New York, as his running mate. In his acceptance speech, he declared communism as a \"principal disturber of the peace in the world today\" and said, \"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\" Some people, including those within his own campaign staff, believed this weakened Goldwater's chances, as he effectively severed ties with the moderates and liberals of the Republican Party.\n\nFormer vice president and GOP presidential nominee (and future President) Richard Nixon introduced the Arizonan as \"Mr. Conservative\" and \"Mr. Republican\" and he continued that \"he is the man who, after the greatest campaign in history, will be Mr. President — Barry Goldwater\".\n\nAccording to Emmy award-winning television journalist, Belva Davis, she and another black reporter were chased out of the convention by attendees yelling racial slurs.\n\nThe 1964 Republican Platform was dominated by Goldwater conservatives, which meant the platform was dominated by calls for limited government, condemnations of the Kennedy and Johnson foreign and domestic policy, calls for more open space for free enterprise, a hard-line against Communist North Vietnam, calls for reform of the United Nations, a staunch support of NATO, calls for lower taxes, a hard line against international Communism, and an accusation that the Kennedy Administration was guilty of Munich-like appeasement for having opened a hotline with the Soviet Union and not with American allies.\n\nThe roll call vote of the states was as follows, as reported by the New York Times:\n\n\nWilliam E. Miller, a Representative from Western New York who had served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee since 1961, was nominated unanimously on a roll call vote. Goldwater stated that he chose Miller to be his running mate simply because \"he drives Johnson nuts\" with his Republican activism. But by some other accounts, Johnson \"was barely aware of Miller's existence.\" Miller's Eastern roots and Catholic faith balanced the ticket in some ways, however ideologically he was conservative like Goldwater. His relative obscurity—\"he was better known for snipes at President Kennedy than for anything else\"—gave birth to the refrain \"\"Here's a riddle, it's a killer / Who the hell is William Miller?\"\"\n\nHe was replaced as Chairman of the RNC by Dean Burch, a Goldwater loyalist from Arizona.\n\n\n"}

He was known for his unique facial features, which were the result of acromegaly, a syndrome caused by a disorder of the pituitary gland.\n\nHatton was born in the Kee Mar College girls' infirmary in Hagerstown, Maryland. The family moved several times during Hatton’s youth before settling in Hillsborough, Florida. He starred in track and football at Hillsborough High School and was voted Handsomest Boy in his class his senior year.\n\nIn Tampa, Hatton worked as a sportswriter for \"The Tampa Tribune\". He continued working as a journalist until after World War I, when the symptoms of acromegaly developed. Acromegaly distorted the shape of Hatton's head, face, and extremities in a gradual but consistent process. He eventually became severely disfigured by the disease. Because the symptoms developed in adulthood (as is common with the disorder), the disfigurement was incorrectly attributed later by film studio publicity departments to elephantiasis resulting from exposure to a German mustard gas attack during service in World War I. Hatton served in combat and served on the Pancho Villa Expedition along the Mexican border and in France during World War I with the United States Army, from which he was discharged due to his illness.\n\nDirector Henry King noticed Hatton when he was working as a reporter with \"The Tampa Tribune\" covering the filming of \"Hell Harbor\" (1930) and hired him for a small role. After some hesitation, Hatton moved to Hollywood in 1936 to pursue a career playing similar, often uncredited, bit and extra roles. His most notable of these was as a contestant-extra in the \"ugly man competition\" (which he loses to a heavily made up Charles Laughton) in the RKO production of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". He had another supporting-character role as Gabe Hart, a member of the lynch mob in the 1943 film of \"The Ox-Bow Incident\".\n\nUniversal Studios attempted to exploit Hatton's unusual features to promote him as a horror star after he played the part of The Hoxton Creeper (aka The Hoxton Horror) in its sixth Sherlock Holmes film, \"The Pearl of Death\" (1944). He made two films playing \"the Creeper\", \"House of Horrors\" (filmed in 1945, but not released until 1946, after his death) and \"The Brute Man\" (1946, also released posthumously).\n\nAround Christmas 1945, Hatton suffered a series of heart attacks, a direct result of his acromegalic condition. On February 2, 1946, he suffered a fatal heart attack at his home on South Tower Drive in Los Angeles. His body was transported to Florida and interred at the American Legion Cemetery in Tampa.\n\nHatton's name – and simple but brutish face – have become recurring motifs in popular culture. In season 6, episode 4 of the 1970s television series \"The Rockford Files\" (\"Only Rock-n-Roll Will Never Die, part 1\"), Jim Rockford, exasperated at a friend who dismisses himself as unattractive, exclaims \"You're no Rondo Hatton!\" Hatton's physical likeness inspired the Lothar character in Dave Stevens' 1980s \"Rocketeer Adventure Magazine\" stories, and in Disney's 1991 film version, \"The Rocketeer,\" in which the character is played by actor Tiny Ron in prosthetic make-up.\n\nThe \"2000 AD\" comic book character Judge Dredd, who is rarely seen without his helmet, used \"face-changing technology\" to make himself look like Hatton in issue 52 (18 February 1978) – the first time the character's face was shown unobscured. The name \"Rondo Hatton\" was also in a list of suspects obtained by Dredd during the case. As the artist Brian Bolland revealed in an interview with David Bishop: \"The picture of Dredd’s face – that was a 1940s actor called Rondo Hatton. I've only seen him in one film.\" Additionally, the character \"The Creep\" in the \"Dark Horse Presents\" comic-book series strongly resembled Hatton.\n\nHatton is regularly name-checked in the novels of Robert Rankin, (often referred to as \"the now-legendary Rondo Hatton\") and credited as appearing in films that are either fictional, or in which he clearly had no part, such as the \"Carry On\" films. Rankin's references to Hatton routinely occur in the form of \"he had a Rondo Hatton\" (hat on). Another namecheck occurs in Rafi Zabor's PEN/Faulkner-award winning 1998 novel \"The Bear Comes Home\", where the name is used as a nickname for good-natured but unrefined minor character Tommy Talmo. In the 2004 Stephen King novel, \"The Dark Tower VII\", a character is described as looking \"like Rondo Hatton, a film actor from the 1930s, who suffered from acromegaly and got work playing monsters and psychopaths...\" The episode of \"Doctor Who\" entitled \"The Wedding of River Song\" features Mark Gatiss as a character whose appearance (achieved through prosthetics) is based on Hatton's, credited under the pseudonym \"Rondo Haxton\" for his performance.\n\nA documentary being produced in 2017, \"Rondo and Bob\",<ref>\n"}

The dates of his birth and death are unknown. \n\nHe was a contemporary and imitator of Thomas Chippendale, and not the least considerable of his rivals. He prided himself upon work which he described as \"genteel\", and his speciality was chairs. He manifests the same surprising variations of quality that are noticed in the work of nearly all the English cabinet-makers of the second half of the 18th century, and while his best had an undeniable elegance, his worst was exceedingly bad: squat, ill-proportioned and confusing. Some of his chairbacks are so nearly identical with Chippendale's that it is difficult to suppose that the one did not copy from the other, and most of the designs of the greater man enjoyed priority of date. During a portion of his career, Manwaring was a devotee of the Chinese taste; he likewise practised in the Gothic manner. He appears to have introduced the small bracket between the front rail of the seat and the top of the chair leg, or at all events to have made such constant use of it, that it has come to be regarded as characteristic of his work. Manwaring described certain products of his own work as \"elegant and superb\", and as possessing \"grandeur and magnificence\". He did not confine himself to furniture but produced many designs for rustic gates and railings, often very extravagant. One of his most absurd rural chairs has rock-work with a waterfall in the back.\n\nAmong Manwaring's writings were \"The Cabinet and Chair Makers' Real Friend and Companion, or the Whole System of Chairmaking Made Plain and Easy\" (1765); \"The Carpenters' Compleat Guide to Gothic Railing\" (1765); and \"The Chair-makers' Guide\" (1766).\n"}

In contrast to some accounts, which suggest that he lived beyond his means, it appears that he remained wealthy, certainly after he had succeeded to his father's estates in 1816.\n\nHis eccentricity may be understandable since, as his daughter the Duchess of Cleveland wrote in her \"Life and Letters of Lady Hester Stanhope\", his own father refused to send him to school but kept him at the family home of Chevening. The plan was that Philip would agree to his father's terminating the entail on the estates. The biography implies that the Earl would then have sold the estates and sent the money overseas, impoverishing his family. Hester helped her brother escape and her letters, quoted in the \"Life\", record that William Pitt the Younger and others rejoiced over what she had done.\n\nStanhope became interested in the story of the \"foundling\" (aka a \"feral child\") Kaspar Hauser, a youth who had appeared in Nuremberg in 1828 and had become famous through his claim that he had been raised in total isolation in a dark room and could tell nothing about his identity. Furthermore, Hauser was found with a cut wound in 1829 and claimed to have been attacked by a hooded man. This led to various rumours that he might be of princely parentage but also suspicions that he was an impostor.\n\nStanhope first met Hauser in 1831 and soon felt a strong affection for the young man: indeed, their relationship could have had homo-erotic undertones, as contemporary rumours suggested. He endowed him generously and paid for (unavailing) inquiries in Hungary to clarify the young man's origin, as the latter, in 1830, had claimed to remember some Hungarian and Slavic words which had led to speculations that he might originate from there.\n\nHauser's custodian, Baron von Tucher, criticised Stanhope's pedagogically wrong behaviour towards Hauser and retired from his custodianship. Now Stanhope, in December 1831, became Hauser's foster-father and transferred him to the care of a schoolmaster.\n\nIn January 1832, he returned to England from where he continued to communicate by letter with his fosterling and also with officials examining the case. Stanhope had favoured the theory that Hauser stemmed from Hungarian magnates but had to give up this idea when he was informed that further inquiries in Hungary had, once more, failed completely. In a letter to the Bavarian court president Anselm von Feuerbach (dated 5 October 1832), Stanhope now clearly uttered his doubts in Hauser's credibility.\n\nWhile he continued to pay for his fosterling's living expenses, he never made good on his promise that he would take him to England and his letters to Hauser became less affectionate. Hauser did realise this change of mood. On 14 December 1833, Hauser came home with a deep wound in his chest and claimed to have been stabbed by a stranger. He died three days later.\n\nAlthough Stanhope had long stopped believing in Hauser's tales, he at first was of opinion that Hauser had indeed been murdered, a view he uttered in one of his letters (dated 28 December). In another letter from 7 January 1834, when he had received more information on what had happened, a change of mind announces itself: he would later advocate the position that Hauser himself had inflicted the wound by pressure, and that, after he had squeezed the point of the knife through his wadded coat, it had penetrated much deeper than he had intended.\n\nIn his \"Tracts Relating to Caspar Hauser\" (1836, German original: 1835) Stanhope published all known evidence against Hauser:The more I was deceived in this affair, and the more erroneous were my views, the more is it now my duty to act with zeal, and, if it were in my power, with ability, to preserve others as far as possible from similar errors. Though I have on that account appeared in an unfavourable light to some of those who are known or unknown to me, though I have been abused and even calumniated, I find a sufficient consolation in my own conscience.\n\nStanhope, indeed, was attacked by followers of Hauser, and even accused of contriving his death. They suggested that Hauser was a hereditary prince of Baden and was murdered for political reasons. Some professional historians (such as Ivo Striedinger) defended Lord Stanhope as a \"seeker of truth\" and as a deceived philanthropist who had realised his delusion.\n\nAnthroposophist author Johannes Mayer, however, substantiated the accusations against Stanhope in a major biographical study of him and showed that he was in fact a British political agent working for the House of Baden against Kaspar Hauser.\n\nOn 19 November 1803 he married Hon. Catherine Lucy Smith, daughter of Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington, by whom he had two sons and one daughter:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800820", "title": "Office of Commercial Space Transportation", "text": "Office of Commercial Space Transportation\n\nThe Office of Commercial Space Transportation (generally referred to as FAA/AST or simply AST) is the branch of the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that approves any commercial rocket launch operations — that is, any launches that are not classified as model, amateur, or \"by and for the government\" — in the case of a U.S. launch operator and/or a launch from the U.S.\n\nWith the signing of Executive Order 12465 on February 25, 1984, President Reagan designated the Department of Transportation to be the lead agency for commercial expendable launch vehicles. This selection occurred following an interagency competition between the Departments of Commerce and Transportation to be the lead agency. At the time, Congress and the industry supported the Department of Commerce for the lead role, and draft legislation named the Department of Commerce as the agency responsible for the new industry. However, it was the Administration's call, and, moreover, the Administration contended that no legislation was necessary. However, the Department of Transportation was selected for this role only after agreeing that it would not place the lead agency role in the Federal Aviation Administration due to concerns about FAA's \"heavy-handed\" regulation. Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole selected Jennifer Dorn to oversee the new responsibility. The Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST) was established in late 1984, and placed in the Office of the Secretary.\n\nAt the time the Executive Order was signed, the government's means for controlling commercial launches was through a unique application of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The use of ITAR was in response to a 1982 proposed private rocket launch by Space Services, Inc. Specifically, SSI's launch had been declared by the US government to be an \"export\" into space, thereby requiring an \"export license\" from the Department of State's Office of Munitions Control. The Administration continued to oppose legislation, however, the Department Of Transportation negotiated an arrangement whereby the Department of State would agree to delegate to DOT the authority to use the ITAR \"export license\" insofar as it related to licensing commercial space launches. The DOS letter agreeing to this transfer also stated that the Department of State felt uncomfortable with the use of the \"export license\" as a means to control commercial launches, and that it believed that a legal authority specifically designed for commercial space launches was preferable. This letter from the State Department to the Secretary of Transportation persuaded the Reagan administration to change its position regarding the need for legislation, and paved the way for passage of the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984.\n\nThe first 10 years of OCST were marked by major challenges—and most of these challenges fell into either the policy or regulatory arena. Accordingly, the Office of Commercial Space Transportation was divided into two major functions, policy formulation and shuttle pricing strategy, headed by Donald Trilling, and regulatory oversight, headed by Norman Bowles. The new industry was immediately confronting problems. Starstruck was stuck in the Department of State's export licensing process. Commercial launch firms were being undercut by NASA's shuttle pricing policy. Launch companies discovered that insurance rates that NASA and the US Air Force were setting were impossible to meet. Then launch companies confronted problems with trying to use the government launch facilities. Over the course of several years, these issues emerged and were quickly resolved. OCST established its reputation within the space community that it could create the hospitable path the industry needed to grow and flourish.\n\nInterim regulations implementing the Commercial Space Launch Act were issued within a year of the Act's passage and final regulations were issued a year later. The licensing framework created at that time was modular and designed to handle any type of space vehicle or spacecraft. At the time it was designed based on the most modern regulatory principles. The regulatory approach was based on the assumption that the era of traditional expendable launch vehicles would be brief and that before long, new, different designs would emerge; this was not a view held by the traditional space community. This turned out to be true, more than OCST had envisioned. The first Office of Commercial Space Transportation regulatory action was a precedent setting payload approval of \"cremains\", which consisted of human cremated remains enclosed in lipstick style capsules. Within the first 8 years, 30 licensed launches would occur (31 if one includes Starstruck) and an innovative aircraft launched vehicle would be licensed and a re-entry vehicle approval action would be well underway. A review of Hawaii's Palima Point as a prospective spaceport location had been completed (although political factors had caused the state to drop its proposal) and two other states had approached OCST with prospective proposals. The concept that the license process had to look forward to new concepts had been validated.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1992 the OCST regulatory program had taken an aggressive approach to building a program that anticipated future issues and had taken actions to reduce or eliminate future stumbling blocks. From the very beginning it prepared environmental impact statements or assessments that permitted the categorical exclusion of commercial space launches. Before the first re-entry vehicle it had completed an environmental study of re-entry vehicle operation. OCST's Launch Hazard Analysis report issued in 1988 had even studied the risks of reentering vehicle components to the public safety, paving the way for subsequent reentry vehicle proposals. Proactively, it approached the National Transportation Safety Board to ensure NTSBs investigators would be prepared in advance of an incident or accident.\n\nAs part of an effort to ensure OCST maintained a light regulatory touch, in 1991 OCST Director Stephanie Lee-Myers and Associate Director for Licensing and Safety, Norman Bowles met with Burt Rutan, pre-eminent air plane designer to get his views on how to avoid over-regulating the commercial launch industry. Burt Rutan informed Lee-Myers and Bowles that he knew nothing about space, and was not entertaining any thoughts of going into the space launch business. Less than 10 years later, his vehicle SpaceShipOne would win the Ansari XPrize as the first privately manned vehicle to fly into outer space.\n\nIn 1984, OCST had made its motto, \"Blue skies; not red tape.\" By 1992, OCST had completed two studies that were beginning to explore the concept of industry self-regulation. Previous studies had demonstrated that the public safety risks from commercial space launches were exceptionally low. The low risks argued for a larger industry role in its own regulation. The first 10 years was an era of light touch, and enlightened regulation that would end with the transfer of OCST from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to the Federal Aviation Administration. By 2017, SpaceX would accuse OCST and FAA of regulatory overreach.\n\nEarly in President William Clinton's administration, the office was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration in 1995 during the tenure of OCST Director Frank Weaver. After Frank Weaver, the office was headed by Patti Grace Smith until 2008. Under her administration, the F.A.A. licensed the Mojave Air & Space Port in California to become the first inland commercial spaceport in the country. SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned vehicle to reach space, was launched from this facility in 2004.\n\nIn August 2019, the office had 97 personnel assigned out of 108 positions authorized. The increase in commercial space launches and reentries in recent years—licensing 33 to 44 launches in 2019 vs. \"single-digit number of launches annually\" in earlier years, and estimating >50 launches in 2021, and a much higher rate of reentries forecast—has seen workload increase ten-fold since 2012, yet staffing has increased by only 40 percent. The office is currently undergoing a reorganization with a goal to complete it by year-end 2019.\n\nUnder international law, the nationality of the launch operator and the location of the launch determines which country is responsible for any damage that occurs. Due to this, the United States requires that rocket manufacturers and launchers adhere to specific regulations to carry insurance and protect the safety of people and property that may be affected by a flight. The office also regulates launch sites, publishes quarterly launch forecasts, and holds annual conferences with the space launch industry. The office is headed by the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST), who is currently Kelvin Coleman. They are located in Washington, DC, and ultimately operate under the Department of Transportation.\nAST is responsible for licensing private space vehicles and spaceports within the US. This is in contrast with NASA, which is a research and development agency of the U.S. Federal Government, and as such neither operates nor regulates the commercial space transportation industry. The regulatory responsibility for the industry has been assigned to the Federal Aviation Administration, which is a regulatory agency. NASA does, however, often use launch satellites and spacecraft on vehicles developed by private companies.\n\nAccording to its legal mandate, AST has the responsibility to:\n\nAST is organized into five divisions:\n\n\nFor a vehicle to legally be considered a rocket, its \"thrust must be greater than lift for the majority of powered flight\". Commercial rockets fall into two basic categories: Amateur and Licensed.\n\nAn amateur rocket has a total impulse of 200,000 lb-s or less, and cannot reach an altitude of 150 km above sea level. If a rocket exceeds these capabilities (or if it has a person on-board), it is considered licensable.\n\nAmateur rockets come in 3 classes, and the regulations applied to each class increase as you move up through the classes. The following list describes the general regulations.\n\nClass 1—Model Rockets do not require approval to be launched, and are legal so long as they are launched in a safe manner.\n\nClass 2—High-Power Rockets require approval to enter National Airspace. Information regarding the rocket and where it will be launched must be provided to obtain this approval.\n\nClass 3—Advanced High-Power Rockets require approval to enter National Airspace. More advanced information about the rocket (such as the dynamic stability profile) and operations is required to obtain this approval.\n\nOnce a rocket exceeds amateur rocket criteria, it is considered \"Licensed,\" which means it requires either a License or Experimental Permit in order to fly.\n\nExperimental Permits are authorizations given to reusable rockets to fly in a specific area, called the \"Operating Area.\" This authorization is optional, but it is easier to obtain than a license. It is easier because unlike a license, an experimental permit does not require an Expected Casualty analysis, nor a full System Safety Process. However, the permit is also more limited. Among other things, a permitted rocket cannot be used to carry people or things for compensation. Examples of permitted rockets include all participants in the X Prize Cup.\n\nA Licensed Rocket encompasses all other commercial rockets, including anything non-amateur, orbital, or large expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). Examples of licensed rockets would include all Atlas, Delta, and Titan rockets. These rockets are subject to the US Code of Federal Regulations (14 C.F.R., Chapter III, §400-460).. Launches that are by and for the government are exempted from this regulation. NASA's shuttle and military rockets, for example, do not require a license to launch. (They are required to meet NASA and Air Force regulations instead.) A \"Commercial Launch License\" must be obtained from FAA/AST before any rocket in this category may be launched from any US territory or if launch is conducted by a U.S citizen.\n\nLaunch sites, in addition to the launch vehicles that operate there, must also receive authorization from AST. The launch site regulations are contained in Part 420.\n\nIn general, when licensing launch operations, AST uses a 3-pronged approach to safety: Quantitative Analysis, System Safety Process, and Operating Restrictions.\n\nAST will generally require that the operator perform what's known as an \"E Analysis.\" E (\"Eee-sub-cee\") is shorthand for Expected Casualty – a calculation of the probability of casualty to any and all groups of people within the maximum dispersion of the vehicle. In the simplest case, a rocket will have \"containment\", which means that there are no people or property located within the maximum range of the vehicle. Most rockets, however, cannot achieve containment, and must be regulated using a risk-based approach.\n\nA calculation of risk takes into account various failure modes of the rocket, various locations of the people, various shelters in which they reside, and various manners in which they can be hurt (direct impact, blast overpressure, toxic cloud, etc.). The calculation is very involved, even for relatively small rockets. In all cases, the assumptions in the calculation become the limits on the day of launch. For example, if a vehicle is analyzed for malfunction turn due to thrust offset, and the assumed wind in the model is , then one of the GO/NO GO criteria on the day of launch will be a <30 knot wind. For AST, as it is with most government agencies, Unknown = No.\n\nCertain rockets are hard to quantify in an analysis. Newer vehicles especially do not have the history required to demonstrate reliability, and thus the uncertainty in quantitative analyses can be substantial. In all cases, but especially in cases where quantitative uncertainty is at a maximum, AST will require that the launch operator follow a System Safety Process.\n\nA System Safety Process (SSP) can come in many forms, and generally involves \"Top-Down\" analyses (such as Fault Trees), \"Bottom-Up\" analyses (such as a Hazard Analysis or Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA)), and various other analyses as required (Fishbone). Rocket systems, failure modes, external hazards, and everything else are analyzed with an eye towards public safety. From these systematic analyses, mitigation measures - or actions taken to reduce the risk - are developed. Just as in the quantitative analysis, these mitigation measures become GO/NO GO criteria on the day of launch. AST will generally require verification (evidence of an operator using mitigation measures) for every safety-critical system on the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to all the operating restrictions developed in the quantitative analyses and system safety processes, AST requires other restrictions be followed. These are described in the Code of Federal Regulations. An example of an operating restriction is a Collision Avoidance Analysis (COLA) for rockets operating above 150 km – to preclude collisions with manned or manable space structures (such as the ISS or Shuttle).\n\n\n"}

Two units (reactors) were planned, but the second unit was never completed due to construction delays, cost overruns, and troubles obtaining financing. The construction permit for the plant was granted in 1976, and construction on Unit 1 was completed in 1986. Full power operation of Unit 1 began in 1990. Unit 2 has been canceled and most of its major components sold to other plants. With its 1,244-megawatt electrical output, Seabrook Unit 1 is the largest individual electrical generating unit on the New England power grid. It is the second largest nuclear plant in New England after the two-unit Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut.\n\nThe construction of Seabrook Station was completed ten years later than expected, with a cost approaching $7 billion. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) described its own regulatory oversight of Seabrook as \"a paradigm of fragmented and uncoordinated government decision making,\" and \"a system strangling itself and the economy in red tape.\" The large debt involved led to the bankruptcy of Seabrook's major utility owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire. At the time, this was the fourth largest bankruptcy in United States corporate history.\n\nA second reactor was proposed in 1972 and cancelled in 1988. It was 22% complete.\n\nThe plant was originally owned by more than 10 separate utility companies serving five New England states. In 2002, most sold their shares to FPL Energy (a subsidiary of FPL Group), later known as NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy now owns 88.2% of Seabrook Station. The remaining portion is owned by municipal utilities in Massachusetts. The station is one of five nuclear generating facilities operated by FPL Group. The other four are St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant and Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station operated by sister company Florida Power & Light (a regulated utility), and the Duane Arnold Energy Center and Point Beach Nuclear Generating Station operated by NextEra Energy.\n\nIn 2005, a security fence installed by a subcontracted engineering firm the previous year failed a Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection and was declared inoperable. In 2006, the owner of the plant, FPL Energy Seabrook LLC, was fined $65,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since \"both design of the system and testing procedures did not adhere to NRC guidelines\".\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Republican nominee John McCain mentioned the possibility of building the once-planned second reactor at Seabrook. The idea drew cautious support from some officials, but would be difficult due to financial and regulatory reasons.\n\nIn 2017, due to the steady drop in value of nuclear power plants including Seabrook Station, the town of Seabrook enacted a 9.9 percent tax increase to offset the decrease in tax revenue collected from the plant's owner, NextEra Energy.\n\nIn February 2018, a magnitude 2.7 earthquake occurred approximately 10 miles from Seabrook Station, but the quake didn't trigger any emergency procedures or result in any signs of structural damage to the plant.\n\nIn 2010, the plant applied to have its operating license extended from 2030 to 2050. In September 2012, Massachusetts Reps. Edward Markey and John F. Tierney filed HR 6554, titled the \"Nuclear Reactor Safety First Act\". The bill would prevent nuclear plants from receiving 20-year license extensions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission if they apply more than 10 years before their current 40-year licenses expire. The legislation was specifically aimed at Seabrook Station, which is currently experiencing aging-related problems 22 years into its operating license. The representatives have asserted that granting the plant a license extension covering operation from 2030 to 2050 based on inspections done in 2012 is illogical. They believe that inspection dates more than 10 years before the expiration of the current license are too far from the dates of validity for the extension and therefore may miss additional age-related problems that may occur in the future.\n\nIn February 2012, there were safety concerns about concrete degradation at the plant. Concrete surrounding an electric control tunnel at the nuclear plant had lost almost 22 percent of its strength and was showing signs of an alkali–silica reaction (ASR) because of more than a decade of ground-water infiltration, according to an NRC inspection report released in May 2011. A growing chorus of local politicians were \"urging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to halt the relicensing process for Seabrook Station until a long-term solution is implemented\".\n\nIn June 2017, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials \"reviewed numerous documents and inspected the plant as it gauges NextEra's safety plan to monitor and manage the alkali-silica reaction phenomenon present in concrete throughout the power plant\". In October 2017, federal regulators allowed the non-profit nuclear watchdog group C-10 to weigh in on the license amendment request. The NRC has committed to finishing its review of the license amendment request concerning the alkali-silica reaction phenomenon by the third quarter of 2018.\n\nIn 2013, the Nuclear Energy Institute released a study showing the positive impact of Seabrook Station on the economy and environment. Key findings are listed below.\n\nIn the eight years before construction started at Seabrook, residents had opposed the plant before regulatory agencies and in a town meeting vote. Spurred on by the failure of these methods, and the success of a large anti-nuclear site occupation in Whyl, Germany, local people formed the Clamshell Alliance.\n\nOn August 1, 1976, 600 protestors rallied at the Seabrook Station construction site. In May 1977, more than 2,000 protestors, including 1,400 members of the Clamshell Alliance, occupied the site. Of the protestors, 1,414 were arrested and held for two weeks after most refused bail.\n\nAnother vocal opponent of the plant was then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, who blocked the opening for several years due to environmental issues as well as concern about emergency evacuation plans. The NRC had stipulated that workable evacuation plans needed to be in place for all towns within a radius of the plant. Four Massachusetts towns were within the ten-mile radius, and thus Governor Dukakis' approval of evacuation plans was required.\n\nA lawsuit complaining that the NPP would cause thermal pollution was launched by anti-nuclear opposition. This was rejected without merit, but it delayed construction by 7.5 months.\nThese protests and lawsuits are the reason the plant cost double initial estimates.\n\nIn September 2017, activist Steve Comley Sr. along with his non-profit \"We The People\" paid for an electronic billboard in Salisbury, Massachusetts allegedly warning of the absence of an evacuation plan in the event of an accident at Seabrook Station. In January 2018, the town of Merrimac, Massachusetts joined half a dozen other communities \"calling for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to hold a hearing on whether the Seabrook, New Hampshire, nuclear power plant's evacuation plan can be effectively implemented\". In response, NextEra Energy released the following statement: \n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. The 2010 U.S. population within of Seabrook was 118,747, an increase of 10.1 percent in a decade. The 2010 U.S. population within was 4,315,571, an increase of 8.7 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Boston (40 miles to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Seabrook was 1 in 45,455, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n"}

The Japanese Supreme Court ruled the hunter was legitimately confused (although the reason that he was judged not guilty was on the interpretation of \"date of hunt\", not the word confusion).\n\nIn Japanese folklore, like the \"Kitsune\" (fox) and the \"tanuki\" (typically a Japanese raccoon dog), \"mujina\" (which could be raccoon dog or badger) are frequently depicted as \"yōkai\" that shapeshift and deceive humans. They are first seen in literature in the Nihon Shoki in the part about Empress Suiko's 35th year (627), where it states, \"[I]n two months of spring, there are mujina in the country of Mutsu (春2月、陸奥国に狢有り), they turn into humans and sing songs (人となりて歌う)\" demonstrating that, in that era, there was the general idea that mujina shapeshift and deceive humans. In the Shimōsa region, they are called , and they would shapeshift into a \"kozō\" (little monk) wearing a strangely short kimono with a kappa-like bobbed head, and frequently appear on roads at night without many people and say, \".\" The story in Lafcadio Hearn's \"\" collections called \"Mujina\" about the witnessing of a faceless ghost (a noppera-bō) is also well-known.\n\nOn May 19, 1959, \"Honolulu Advertiser\" reporter Bob Krauss reported a sighting of a \"mujina\" at the Waialae Drive-In Theatre in Kahala. Krauss reported the witness watched a woman combing her hair in the women's restroom, and when the witness came close enough, the \"mujina\" turned, revealing her featureless face. The witness was reported to have been admitted to the hospital for a nervous breakdown. Noted Hawaiian historian, folklorist, and author Glen Grant, in a 1981 radio interview, dismissed the story as rumor, only to be called by the witness herself, who gave more details on the event, including the previously unreported detail that the \"mujina\" in question had red hair. The drive-in no longer exists, having been torn down to make room for Public Storage.\n\nGrant has also reported on a number of other \"mujina\" sightings in Hawaii, from ‘Ewa Beach to Hilo.\n\nThe term can also refer to the following:\n\n\n\n"}

Like huts, shacks are constructed by hand using available materials; however, whereas huts are usually rural and made of natural materials (mud, rocks, sticks, etc.) shacks are generally composed of scavenged man-made materials like abandoned construction debris, repurposed consumer waste and other useful discarded objects that can be quickly acquired at little or no cost and fashioned into a small dwelling. \nIn areas of high population density and high poverty, shacks are often the most prevalent form of housing; it is possible that up to a billion people worldwide live in shacks. Fire is a significant hazard in tight-knit shack settlements. Settlements composed mostly or entirely of shacks are known as slums or shanty towns.\n\nIn Australian English \"shack\" can also refer to a small holiday house with limited conveniences, for instance it may not have running water or electricity.\n\nIn oilfield drilling (Canada) a shack can also be the word for a wellsite trailer. Structures that were once notorious among oilfield workers for being cramped, uncomfortable and generally unpleasant to be in are now no longer good enough for companies that are serious about employee retention.\n"}

Signed to Decca Records in 1996, Allan made his country music debut with the release of his single \"Her Man\", the lead-off to his gold-certified debut album \"Used Heart for Sale\", which was released in 1996 on Decca. His second album, \"It Would Be You\", followed in 1998. Allan's third album, \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\", was his first one for MCA Nashville (to which he has been signed ever since) and his first platinum album. His next albums, \"Alright Guy\" (2001) and \"See If I Care\" (2003), both were also certified platinum while \"Tough All Over\" (2005) and \"Greatest Hits\" (2007) and \"Living Hard\" (2007) were all certified gold. His next two albums \"Get Off on the Pain\" (2010) and \"Set You Free\" (2013) both reached the Top 10 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums charts, at numbers 2 and 1 respectively.\n\nOverall, Allan's nine studio and greatest hits albums have produced 26 singles on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, including the number one hits \"Man to Man\", \"Tough Little Boys\" (both 2003), \"Nothing On but the Radio\" (2004), and \"Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain)\" (2013). Seven more of his singles have reached the Top 10 on this chart as well: his debut single \"Her Man\", \"It Would Be You\" (both at #7), \"Right Where I Need to Be\" (at #5), \"The One\" (at #3), \"Best I Ever Had\" (a cover of a Vertical Horizon song) (at #7), \"Life Ain't Always Beautiful\" (at #4), and \"Watching Airplanes\" (#2).\n\nGary Allan Herzberg was born and raised in La Mirada, California, to Harley and Mary Herzberg. To ensure that the family would focus on music, Allan's mother insisted that the family's guitars would always remain visible in the home. At age 13, Allan began playing in honky tonks with his father. Two years later, he was offered his first recording contract, from A&M Records, but rejected the deal. His parents wanted him to finish his education and his father felt that Allan had yet to develop his own distinctive style. Despite his commitment to finishing school, Allan reflects that he was rarely alert in class. \"I played the bars at night, I was half asleep when I got to school. I thought sleep was what you did when you go to school.\"\n\nAfter graduating from La Serna High School in Whittier, California, Allan continued to play in the bars with his band, the Honky Tonk Wranglers. Many of the venues they played were packed, and promoters often tried to move them to larger clubs. The moves would have required him to stop playing some of the older country music, such as covers of George Jones songs, so Allan refused.\n\nIn 1987, Gary married his first wife, Tracy Taylor. They have since divorced. He married model Danette Day on November 28, 1998, in South Carolina and they divorced in June 1999. His third wife, Angela (whom he wed on June 5, 2001), died by suicide on October 25, 2004.\n\nAllan was introduced to songwriter/producer Byron Hill on August 28, 1993, by a mutual friend and talent-scout Jim Seal, at a bar called the Lion D'or in Downey, California, where Allan was already regularly performing. Seal and Hill had asked Allan if they could showcase an unsigned act that they were developing there. Hill had arranged to bring the head of A&R from a major label to the show to see this other act perform. Allan kindly let them use his stage for the event, giving the new act the opening performance slot that night. Hill promised Gary that they would make sure the A&R person remained there to see his portion of the show. Everyone was knocked out with Allan's performance, and very impressed with his voice. From that point on, Byron Hill began sending Gary songs. Without any serious funding at the time, Hill arranged for Allan to go into Seal's small studio in California to try his vocals on some of existing demo tracks that Byron had sent to Gary from Nashville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, Hill became head of A&R at BNA Entertainment on October 29 of that same year and immediately wanted to sign Allan to BNA, but the then current roster conditions and other circumstances related to the planned restructuring of RCA/BNA Nashville stood in the way.\n\nIn the meantime, Allan took a job selling cars. He left a demo tape in the glove box of a truck purchased by a wealthy couple. When the couple discovered that he was the singer, they wrote him a check for $12,000. This independent funding allowed Allan to go to Nashville to record some of the songs that were on that early demo tape with Byron Hill as producer. On September 11, 1995, they worked at Javelina Studios for a couple of days on the four songs that Hill immediately showed to labels. Allan's recordings brought serious responses from several labels including Mercury, RCA, and Decca. A meeting was then held at a Nashville hotel among Hill, Allan, and friend of Allan's, who was a program director for a radio station in California.\n\nThe meeting was to arrange two showcases in Los Angeles, California, to put Allan on stage at two of the radio station's regular nights at a local club. Byron arranged for staffers at the Nashville office of Decca Records to attend the first showcase held on November 1, 1995. Decca immediately wanted to sign Allan, and knowing that Byron was lining up other labels to see Gary, Decca asked them to cancel the second showcase. A rep from RCA was already booked to see the second showcase the following week, but the \"bird-in-hand\" deal offer was too tempting for both Byron and Gary, so they committed to the Decca offer. Decca staffer Mark Wright and Byron Hill co-produced Gary's first three albums for Decca beginning sessions on March 11, 1996 for \"Used Heart for Sale\", then \"It Would Be You\", both of which yielded top five singles, and later \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\" (which also included Tony Brown as a co-producer). It was during the recording of the first album that they recorded \"It Must Have Been Ol' Santa Claus\", as an added track to be packaged on various MCA/Decca Christmas compilations. Then Byron and Gary got a personal call from Harry Connick, Jr., the writer of the song, thanking them for the recording, during which he added a few of his New Orleans Jazz style \"very cool man!\" compliments. The Christmas recording has been since released on at least four compilations. The merger of Polygram, Decca, and MCA Records marked the closing of Decca and Gary was moved to MCA Records.\n\nHis first deal, with Decca Records Nashville, produced his debut studio album \"Used Heart for Sale\" in 1996. The album was named \"Best of the Month\" by \"Stereo Review\". It advanced to the Top 20 of the charts. Its first single, \"Her Man\" (previously recorded by Waylon Jennings) gave Allan his first Top 10 country hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart. Other tracks from this album, however, proved less successful.\n\nAllan's second studio album, \"It Would Be You\", was released in 1998. Although he has been writing songs since his teen years, the singer has not really hesitated to bump his work from his albums in favor of those written by other songwriters that he respects. For this album, Allan replaced one of his songs with \"No Judgement Day\", written by Allen Shamblin. Even though that song was a hidden acoustic track, radio stations started giving it some heavy airplay. \"No Judgement Today\" tells the story of a restaurant owner from a small town in Texas, where ex co-workers killed him in search of money, for drugs and alcohol. The album's title track became Allan's second hit to reach the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, remaining there after 21 weeks of radio play, \"way beyond the tenure of most disposable radio hits.\" In early-1999, Decca Records folded, and when Allan moved to the parent label, MCA Nashville, the \"It Would Be You\" album was left in limbo.\n\nAllan was named as \"Country Music's Sexy Star\" by \"People Magazine\". He also delved into the acting world in the TV mini-series \"Shake, Rattle, & Roll\", in which he would play the lead role of Eddie Cochran. He followed that role with a part in the CBS TV series \"Pensacola: Wings of Gold\", but describes his acting experience as \"tedious.\"\n\nIn 1999, Allan released his third studio album \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\". This was an album that he recorded while in the midst of divorcing from his second wife, Versace model Danette Day, after only seven months of marriage. Unlike his first two albums, \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\" made fuller use of background singers and stringed instruments, \"resulting in a lusher, fuller sound.\" The new album avoided the \"devil-may-care brashness\" of the first two, instead presenting a tone balanced between youthful optimism and \"the knowledge that some of life's experiences exact a high toll.\" \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\" was certified platinum, and it included two successful singles, including its title track.\n\nThe singer's fourth studio album \"Alright Guy\" was released in 2001. It contained the singles \"The One,\" \"Man of Me,\" and \"Man to Man,\" the latter of which became his first number one hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" country charts. That same year, Allan married for the third time, to Angela, a flight attendant who he met on an airplane.\n\nDespite his previous success and eight years in the music business, Allan was nominated for the Country Music Association's Horizon Award, typically given to newcomers, in 2003. The same year, he released his fifth studio album \"See If I Care.\" Allan had to be controversial to keep the album's title. Also, he thought that title had epitomized his attitude towards the music business, and that he would continue to make the music that he wanted to make regardless of whether the record label chose to back him or people chose to buy the album. \"See If I Care\" included Allan's second and third number one singles with \"Tough Little Boys\", and \"Nothing On but the Radio.\" \"Songs About Rain\" was a Top 15 hit.\n\nIn 2003, Allan and his wife, Angela Herzberg, moved to Tennessee from California. On October 25, 2004, Angela committed suicide after suffering from depression and migraines. Allan initially put his career on hold, but soon returned to music to deal with the loss of his wife. This resulted in 2005's \"heart-wrenchingly personal album,\" \"Tough All Over\". He included several songs which he wrote or cowrote, including \"Puttin' Memories Away\" and \"I Just Got Back from Hell,\" which dealt directly with his grief. Several years later, Gary discussed his wife's suicide on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\n\"Tough All Over\" sold over 99,000 copies in its first week, debuting at No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. It was subsequently certified gold by the RIAA as of December 20, 2006, and contained the Top 10 singles \"Best I Ever Had\" (written by Vertical Horizon's Matt Scannell) and \"Life Ain't Always Beautiful,\" co-written by country singer Cyndi Thomson (under the name Cyndi Goodman).\n\nAllan's first \"Greatest Hits\" collection was released on March 6, 2007. A Number One album on the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums charts, the album reprised the greatest hits from his first six albums, as well as two new songs. One of these, titled \"A Feelin' Like That\", was co-written by David Lee Murphy and Ira Dean (the latter a former member of Trick Pony); the single peaked at No. 12 on the country singles charts.\n\nThe album \"Living Hard\" was released on October 23, 2007. Serving as its lead-off single was the song \"Watching Airplanes,\" which spent more than thirty weeks on the country charts, where it reached a peak of No. 2 and went No. 1 on the Mediabase Chart. The song's music video was filmed during live concerts, including one at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. Second single \"Learning How to Bend\" – co-written by Allan – quickly became another hit song, peaking at No. 13. The video was filmed during a live performance at the House of Blues in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Following this song is third single \"She's So California,\" which Allan co-wrote with Jaime Hanna (of Hanna-McEuen) and Jon Randall, and it peaked at No. 24, becoming his first single to miss the top 20 since \"Lovin' You Against My Will\" in 2000.\n\nA new single, entitled \"Today\", was released on June 12, 2009. It served as the lead-off single to the album \"Get Off on the Pain\", which was released on March 9, 2010.\n\nThe title track was the album's second single. The song debuted at No. 42 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the highest-debuting single of his career.\n\n\"Kiss Me When I'm Down\" was released as the album's third single. That song debuted at No. 52 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nAllan's ninth studio album, \"Set You Free\", was released on January 22, 2013. Its first single, \"Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain)\", was released to country radio on September 17, 2012 and reached Number One on the Country Airplay chart on February 9, 2013, giving Allan his fourth Number One country hit and his first since \"Nothing On but the Radio\" in December 2004. In an interview with Broadway's Electric Barnyard, Allan spoke about co-writing with women for the new release. It was the first time in his career he had done so, and he described it as an interesting experience. The album's second single, \"Pieces\", was released to country radio on February 25, 2013. The third single, \"It Ain't the Whiskey\", was released on September 23, 2013.\n\nIn March 2015, Allan released a new single entitled \"Hangover Tonight\". This song would serve as the lead single to his upcoming tenth studio album, entitled \"Hard Way\". In May 2016, the album's second single \"Do You Wish It Was Me?\" was sent to country radio. The third single is \"Mess Me Up\", released to country radio in May 2017. None of these three singles, however, had performed as expected on the charts, resulting in EMI Nashville delaying the release of the album.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Gary Allan among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nIn 2003, Allan told \"CMT\" that he believed Republican candidate, Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the best governor because he is not driven by money.\n\nAllan's voice is described as \"raspy and unpolished.\" The \"New York Times\" describes his music as \"elegant, often deadpan songs [that] tend toward manly understatement.\" His sound is heavily influenced by the Bakersfield scene, especially Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. He prefers this sound to that of the more pop country that is prevalent on country radio, because \"the songs have got to have soul, have real meaning...Country music is...what happens during the week. Rock 'n roll is about what happens at the weekend.\" Because his sound is different from many of the current crop of country singers, as their sound is considerably more pop or rock, Allan has, at times had difficulty getting radio to play his singles. He says he has to \"walk a real fine line\" to \"make sure that I get traditional stuff on the radio.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band's hits include \"Tighten Up\", \"I Can't Stop Dancing\" (both 1968), \"There's Gonna Be A Showdown\", \"Girl You're Too Young\" (1969), \"Here I Go Again\" (also a UK hit in 1972), \"Soul City Walk\" (1975), \"Let's Groove\", \"Everybody Have A Good Time\" (1977), and \"Don't Let Love Get You Down\" (1976).\n\nArchie Bell (born September 1, 1944), who founded the group, was born in Henderson, Texas, his family moving to Houston before he was a year old. He is the second oldest of seven brothers and is the older brother of lead vocalist of Motown's Dazz Band—and world karate champion—Jerry Bell. His brother Ricky Bell (d. 1984) was an NFL player. Eugene Bell was the final brother. Archie formed the group in 1966 with his friends James Wise, Willie Parnell and Billy Butler. They signed with the Houston-based record label Ovide in 1967 and recorded a number of songs including \"She's My Woman\" and \"Tighten Up\", which was recorded in October 1967 at the first of several sessions in which the Drells were backed by the instrumental group the T.S.U. Toronadoes.\n\nThe origins of \"Tighten Up\" came from a conversation Bell had with Butler. Bell was despondent after receiving his draft notice, and Butler, in an attempt to cheer him up, demonstrated the \"Tighten Up\" dance to Bell. Bell asked Butler what it was, and Butler told him the name. Bell then put together the famous track, which hit the charts following his induction into the Army.\n\nBell's promoter, Skipper Lee Frazier, unsuccessfully began pushing the flip side of \"Tighten Up\", a song called \"Dog Eat Dog\". But at the recommendation of a friend, he gave the other side a try. \"Tighten Up\", written by Archie Bell and Billy Butler, contained Archie Bell prodding listeners to dance to the funky musical jam developed by the T.S.U. Toronadoes, and it became a hit in Houston before it was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the \"Billboard\" R&B and pop charts. It also received a R.I.A.A. gold disc by selling 1 million copies. According to the \"Billboard Book of Number One Hits\" by Fred Bronson, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas that \"nothing good ever came out of Texas.\" Bell wanted his listeners to know \"we were from Texas and we were good.\"\n\nMany believe Bell was wounded in action in Vietnam while the band was still at the height of its fame, but he actually injured his leg in a truck accident while stationed in Germany. The success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff, \"I Can't Stop Dancing\", which reached number 28 on the R&B album chart. By this time another of Archie's brothers, Lee Bell (born January 14, 1946, Houston), had replaced Butler, and became the band's choreographer.\n\nReid Farrell, who was from Houston, was the guitarist who traveled and played with the group.\n\nThe band backing Archie Bell & The Drells from 1975-1979 was called \"The Melting Pot Band\", which featured musicians from several states. McNasty McKnight was the band leader playing trombone. Graduates of the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) in Houston traveled with the group, including Don Pope and Tony Salvaggio on saxophone. Other musicians included Lonnie LaLanne and Calvin Owens (trumpet), Abel Salazar (keyboards), and Mike Hughes (drums). LaLanne and Owens were alumni of B.B. King's band.\n\nIn 1975, the band released their \"total-disco comeback album,\" \"Dance Your Troubles Away\". The single \"Soul City Walk\" made number 13 in the UK Singles Chart, but reached only number 42 on the US chart. After moderate chart showings in the late 1970s, the group split in 1980. Archie Bell later released one solo album (\"I Never Had It So Good\" - 1981) on Beckett Records and continued to perform with The Drells for the next twenty years. During the 1990s the lineup also included Steve \"Stevie G.\" Guettler (guitar, vocals), Jeff \"JT\" Strickler (bass guitar, vocals), Steve Farrell (guitar, vocals), Mike Wilson (keyboards, vocals) and Wes Armstrong (drums, vocals) of the Atlanta-based group The Rockerz.\n\nOn April 16, 2013, the Mayor of Houston Annise Parker honored Archie Bell, Lucious Larkins, and James Wise with a proclamation of Archie Bell and the Drells Day.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Archie Bell & the Drells among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1800845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800845", "title": "Second Protectorate Parliament", "text": "Second Protectorate Parliament\n\nThe Second Protectorate Parliament in England sat for two sessions from 17 September 1656 until 4 February 1658, with Thomas Widdrington as the Speaker of the House of Commons. In its first session, the House of Commons was its only chamber; in the second session an Other House with a power of veto over the decisions of the Commons was added.\n\nThere were two sessions the first from 17 September 1656 until 26 June 1657 and a second from 20 January until 4 February 1658. The Second Protectorate Parliament was summoned reluctantly by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell on the advice of the Major-Generals who were running the country as regions under military governors. The Major-Generals thought that a compliant parliament would be the best way to raise money to pay for the Army occupation, and the Navy both of which were involved in the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660).\n\nThe elections were held under the new written constitution called Instrument of Government. It included returning up to thirty members from Scotland and up to another thirty from Ireland. Royalists and Catholics were prevented from standing or voting under Articles XIV and XV. After the election the Council of State stopped one hundred elected members from taking their seats by declaring that they were not \"of known integrity, fearing God\" (Article VII). A further fifty withdrew in protest which left about two hundred and fifty to take their seats for the first session.\n\nThe first session opened in December 1656. The Protectorate government did not have much pressing legislation to present so the House occupied its time with private members bills. However over the next few months three issues would dominate the session. The first was the Militia Bill, the second was the Naylor case and the third was constitutional reform (the Humble Petition and Advice), which was influenced by the failure of the Militia Bill to pass and the Naylor case was to show that the members of Parliament were less religiously tolerant than was constitutionally allowed in \"Instrument of Government\".\n\nThe House voted down Major-General John Desborough's \"Militia Bill\" on 29 January 1657 by one hundred and twenty four votes to eighty eight. This bill would have perpetuated the Decimation Tax that funded the mounted militia, which was collected by Cromwell's Major-Generals; the failure of the bill caused the so-called rule of the Major-Generals in the counties to end.\n\nWith the rejection of the Decimation Tax, it was clear that government through the Major-Generals could not continue. In February 1657 Cromwell was offered the crown and a new constitution called the Humble Petition and Advice.\n\nOn Palm Sunday 1656 James Naylor, a Quaker, reenacted the arrival of Christ in Jerusalem by riding a horse into Bristol attended by followers who sang \"Holy, holy, holy\" and strewed the way with their garments. Although Naylor denied that he was impersonating Jesus, this act outraged many in Parliament in what was seen as an act of blasphemy. There was consensus in the House that Naylor should be punished. However while the House of Commons could pass, and had in recent times passed, acts of attainder against people, it was questioned whether the House could invoke a judicial procedure like that of the now disbanded House of Lords. After much debate and looking at old precedents, the House concluded that it had the right to act in a judicial capacity. So they tried Naylor and passed the following resolution for his blasphemy:\nAfter some thought Cromwell declined the crown as embodied in the Humble Petition. The Naylor case had showed that the members of Parliament were less religiously tolerant than the constitution allowed, and the assumption of judicial powers by the House, worried many in the House, the Grandees in the Army, and Cromwell. So encouraged, Cromwell with the support of the Grandees, pressed the house for a second chamber.\n\nAfter modifications had been made to the Humble Petition, Cromwell agreed to the new constitution and in June 1657 he was reinstated as Lord Protector under the articles of the \"Humble Petition and Advice\". Parliament then went into recess for the summer.\n\nThe Army Grandees agreed to allow the MPs who had been excluded under Article VII of the \"Instrument of Government\" to be allowed to take their seats. But to make sure that the House would be compliant to their wishes, Cromwell nominated 63 members to \"Other House\" permitted by the \"Humble Petition and Advice\", 42 accepted and 37 came to the first meeting.\n\nThis triggered a wave of republican protest in the House of Commons which spread to the rank and file of the Army. Amidst fears of a Levellers revival and Royalist plots, under the prerogative granted to the Lord Protector by the \"Humble Petition and Advice\", Oliver Cromwell dissolved Parliament on 4 February 1658.\n\nThe Second Protectorate Parliament was preceded by the First Protectorate Parliament and succeeded by the Third Protectorate Parliament.\n\n\n\nFrom Cromwell:The Oliver Cromwell Website: a select bibliography of books and articles:\n"}

In 1915, his father, a sharecropper who played guitar, moved the family to Brownsville, Tennessee. Not long after, Estes lost the sight in his right eye when a friend threw a rock at him. At the age of 19, while working as a field hand, he began to perform professionally, mostly at parties and picnics, with the accompaniment of Hammie Nixon, a harmonica player, and James \"Yank\" Rachell, a guitarist and mandolin player. Estes continued to work on and off with both musicians for more than fifty years. He also performed in medicine shows with Willie Newbern.\n\nAt the suggestion of Jim Jackson, Estes made his debut as a recording artist in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1929, at a session organized by Ralph Peer for Victor Records. He recorded the tracks \"Drop Down Mama\" and \"Someday Baby Blues\" with Nixon in 1935. He later worked with Son Bonds and Charlie Pickett.\nHe later recorded for Decca Records and Bluebird Records, with his last prewar recording session taking place in 1941. He made a brief return to recording at Sun Studio in Memphis in 1952, recording \"Runnin' Around\" and \"Rats in My Kitchen\", but otherwise was out of the public eye in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nEstes sang with a distinctive \"crying\" vocal style. He frequently teamed with more capable musicians, such as Yank Rachell, Hammie Nixon, and the piano player Jab Jones. Estes sounded so much like an old man, even on his early records, that blues revivalists reportedly delayed looking for him because they assumed he would have to be long dead (and because the musician Big Bill Broonzy had written that he was dead). By the time he was tracked down by the blues historians Bob Koester and Samuel Charters in 1962, he was completely blind and living in poverty. He resumed touring with Nixon and recording for Delmark Records. Estes, Nixon and Rachell appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964.\n\nMany of Estes's original songs were based on events in his life or people he knew in his hometown, Brownsville, such as the local lawyer (\"Lawyer Clark Blues\"), the local auto mechanic (\"Vassie Williams' Blues\"), or an amorously inclined teenage girl (\"Little Laura Blues\"). In \"Lawyer Clark Blues\", about the lawyer and later judge and senator Hugh L. Clarke, whose family lived in Brownsville, Estes sang that Clark let him \"off the hook\" for an offense. He also dispensed advice on agricultural matters (\"Working Man Blues\") and chronicled his own attempt to reach a recording studio for a session by hopping a freight train (\"Special Agent [Railroad Police Blues]\"). His lyrics combined keen observation with an ability to turn an effective phrase.\n\nSome accounts attribute the nickname Sleepy to a blood pressure disorder or narcolepsy. Bob Koester, the founder of Delmark Records, said that Estes simply had a \"tendency to withdraw from his surroundings into drowsiness whenever life was too cruel or too boring to warrant full attention\".\nEstes himself explained that the nickname was born of his exhausting life as both musician and farmer. \"'Every night I was going somewhere. I'd work all day, play all night and get back home about sunrise. I'd get the mule and get right on going. I went to sleep once in the shed. I used to go to sleep so much when we were playing, they called me Sleepy. But I never missed a note.'\"\n\nEstes suffered a stroke while preparing for a European tour and died on June 5, 1977, at his home of 17 years in Brownsville, Haywood County, Tennessee. He is buried at Elam Baptist Church Cemetery in Durhamville, Lauderdale County, Tennessee.\n\nHis grave marker reads:\n\"Sleepy John Estes\"\n\"\".. ain't goin' to worry Poor John's mind anymore\"\"\n\"In Memory\"\n\"John Adam Estes\"\n\"Jan. 25, 1899\"\n\"June 5, 1977\"\n\"Blues Pioneer\"\n\"Guitarist – Songwriter – Poet\"\nThe epitaph \".. ain't goin' to worry Poor John's mind anymore\" is derived from his song \"Someday Baby Blues.\" \"I Ain't Gonna Be Worried No More\" was recorded in 1935, and in his song \"Drop Down Mama\", also recorded in 1935, Estes referred to himself as \"Poor John\". His grave is located off a country road and at the far end of the cemetery, adjacent to a small grove of trees, secluded but not hidden.\n\nIn 1991, Estes was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nLed Zeppelin's lead singer, Robert Plant, named Estes as one of his earliest influences. Bob Dylan mentioned Estes in the sleeve notes for his album \"Bringing It All Back Home\" (1965).\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the 2011 census results, the municipality has 83,906 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality is located east of Belgrade, in the northern part of Šumadija region, with the northern section being part of the Podunavlje macro-region in the valley of the Danube, while the southern section is located around the valley of the Ralja River, which is a tributary to the Velika Morava's arm of Jezava. With an altitude of 71 meters above sea level, the town of Grocka is one of the lowest parts of Belgrade. Other rivers in the municipality are Bolečica and Gročica (). Being polluted, in March 2019 the environmentalists described both rivers as \"less of a watercourses, more of a sewage watersheds\".\n\nThe municipality of Grocka became part of the wider Belgrade City area in 1955. In 1957 with the dissolution of the Mali Mokri Lug municipality, the eastern section (the villages of Kaluđerica, Leštane and Vinča) were attached to Grocka. In the early 1960s, the municipalities of Umčari and Vrčin were disbanded and incorporated into the municipality of Grocka as well.\n\nThe municipality of Grocka covers an area of 289 km² and includes 15 settlements, all of which are statistically classified as rural, except for the municipal seat of Grocka, which is urban. The small town of Grocka is located on the right bank of the Danube, where the small river Gročica empties into the Danube, 30 km east of Belgrade. Despite being the seat of the municipality, in terms of population, it is only the fourth largest settlement in the municipality, after Kaluđerica, Vrčin and Leštane.\nNeighborhoods of Vrčin:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality has a population of 83,907 inhabitants. Due to immigration and the natural increase of all of the city's municipalities, Grocka has been for decades one of the fastest growing areas of Belgrade. The population boomed in the last 40 years, increasing the number of inhabitants (1971–2011 by 2.38 times). As in other similar areas surrounding Belgrade, the rapid population growth has not been followed by the equal development of infrastructure (roads, waterworks, sewage system, and waste disposal).\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nIn both demographic and economic terms, the municipality is sharply divided into two opposing parts. The western part extends into one urban area with Belgrade, experiencing a boost of both population and economy, as hundreds of small companies are located there (Kaluđerica, Boleč, Leštane, Vinča, Ritopek are some), while the eastern part is agricultural, in particular a fruit growing area, and, apart from the town of Grocka itself, experiencing a net decline in population.\n\nThe microclimate is perfect for fruit growing and grapevines. The area east of Boleč is one of the best known fruit growing areas in Serbia. Fruit growing developed in the late 19th century and Grocka, Boleč, Ritopek, Zaklopača, Begaljica and Brestovik became known as the \"Serbian California,\" producing apples, peaches, apricots, plums, and grapes. Ritopek became a major producer of cherries. Production reduced since the 2000s but the capacity of the orchards is 65,000 tons of fruit per year. In 2017 orchards spread over the area of , or almost a quarter of the municipal total area.\n\nGrocka is also known as the \"Serbian cherry capital\" as the cherry survived as the major crop. Cultivation was introduced by Jovan J. Jovanović, gynecologist of queen Draga and pioneer of reproductive health in Serbia. Jovanović noticed vast orchards and organized fruit production during his studying in Austria-Hungary. Austrian experts surveyed the land, which Jovanović wanted to be close to Belgrade, as the largest market in the state. Taking in account soil structure and climate, they suggested slopes above the Danube in Grocka. He purchased the land in 1906 from the Grocka municipality which was in debts due to the renovation of the Holy Trinity church. The municipality decided to sell numerous parcels, remnants of the former Turkish estates. Jovanović outbid one of the wealthiest Grocka families, the Bećagović. The lots were located in the localities of Rupe and Kozjak, at the entrance into Grocka. From 1906 to 1908 he planted 7,000 trees on , forming the largest ever cherry plantation in the Balkans.\n\nPrior to that, cherry was cultivated only in some individual yards in the Grocka area, and this was beginning of the plantation-type fruit production in Serbia in general. Jovanović introduced varieties like \"hedelfingen\", \"germersdorf\" and \"early Lyonnaise\", but the names were hard to pronounce for the local farmers so they gave them Serbian names which survived, \"herc\" (heart shaped), \"kerminka\" (red juice) and \"doktorka\" [doctor's cherry], after Jovanović, respectively. Local farmers accepted cherry cautiously at first, planting the trees on the arable lots edges, to make shade. Then they planted it jointly with the grapevine but by the 1920s the cherry began to squeeze out other crops and the formation of the cherry nurseries began. From Grocka, cultivation spread to the nearby Ritopek which is today the major production center. After World War II, the new Communist authorities nationalized Jovanović's land, divided it and awarded the lots to the landless. However, few years later the state nationalized the land again, with one part being re-parceled and sold, while the \"PIK Grocka\", agricultural farm was formed on the other. By the 1950s, the production in Grocka outgrew demand of Belgrade farmers markets and the export began. On the sold parcels, the weekend-settlement developed.\n\nOf the other agricultural products, wheat is the most important. The experimental farm of Radmilovac is located near Vinča, as a section of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Agriculture. Radmilovac is being expanded as an experimental ground for future agricultural production.\n\nAs a result of this, industrial processing of the fruit is developed in Grocka, Vinča and Boleč, where the large plantations and refrigeration plants of the agricultural company \"PKB Beograd\" are located. Also, several mills are located in Grocka and Vinča.\n\nThe textile industry is also important (Grocka, \"Dunav\" factory, aka:Partizanka), while hundreds of small family-owned factories and workshops are located in the settlements in the western part of the municipality.\n\nSome major traffic routes, like the \"Smederevski put\" (\"Smederevo road\") and both the Belgrade-Niš railway and highway, pass through the municipal territory. Also, there are several docks on the Danube (Vinča, Grocka) with the prospect of a future marina to be built in Grocka in the next few years.\n\nOther important facilities in the municipality are the Geomagnetic observatory in Brestovik, the Nuclear Institute (with a defunct nuclear reactor) and the Belgrade City dump in Vinča.\n\nTourism is the most developed part of the municipal economy. Almost every village has its own summer festival (like \"Zlatni kotlić\" (\"Golden Cauldron\") in Grocka or \"Dani trešnje\" (\"Days of the cherry\") in Ritopek. The women's monastery of Rajinovac in Begaljica, the possible marina and aqua park in Grocka and the archeological find of Vinča culture are potential opportunities to boost the tourist economy.\n\nThe game hunting grounds of Gavranski Potok (\"Raven's Creek\") are in the municipality.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of Grocka are weekend-settlements, mostly built by the inhabitants of Belgrade. Booming in the 1970s and 1980s, the building of weekend-houses largely stopped in the 1990s. In the 1980s, having a weekend-house in Grocka was a matter of prestige. It is estimated that there are 4,000 such houses in the municipality in several settlements. The largest settlements are Rujište on the slope above the Danube in Grocka itself with 200 houses and Ritopek with 300. The weekend-settlement of Čair, at the entrance into Grocka, is developing into a regular neighborhood.\n\nThe following table gives a preview of the total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\nSince the elections in 2000, Grocka became the most politically turbulent of all Belgrade municipalities. Recent Presidents of the Municipal Assembly:\n\nAs a result of the economic and demographic discrepancy between the western and eastern parts of the municipality, there is a movement for splitting the municipality in two, or perhaps three parts. Primarily, it is about the division in two, with western half becoming new municipality of Vinča, while eastern remaining the municipality of Grocka. Also, there is a possibility of Vrčin splitting from Grocka and forming new municipality of Avalski Venac with other sub-Avalan settlements in the municipality of Voždovac (Beli Potok, Zuce, Pinosava).\n\nGrocka is at the center of one of the best known fruit growing areas in Serbia. Conditions are especially favorable for growing peaches, apricots, plums, cherries and grapes. Industrial processing of the fruit has been developed. There are also several mills and a textile industry (\"Kluz\" factory).\n\nTraffic is also important as Grocka is located on the road of \"Smederevski put\". It also has a small harbor on the Danube, at the Gročica's mouth (which regularly floods Grocka).\n\nTourism is important for the town's economy, with several festivals during the year (most notably, the \"Zlatni kotlić\"). Large weekend-settlement called Rujište is built on the eastern extension of the town.\n\nOne of the landmarks of Grocka for decades was the restaurant \"Vinogradi\" (vineyards). It was built on the hill of \"Agino Brdo\", among the orchards and vineyards, from downtown Grocka and from Belgrade. It was known for the great cuisine and a magnificent panoramic view on Pančevo, Smederevo, Avala, but also on the distant Vršac Mountains and the Carpathians in Romania. Construction began in 1960. It used to be visited by President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, who often came via Danube in his yacht \"Šumadinka\". In his 17 visitations, Tito also brought guests to the restaurant, like Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, Henry Kissinger, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Sukarno and Neil Armstrong. The luxurious venue served as the location of many movies, but from the 1990s it started to decline and by the early 21st century was completely abandoned and covered in overgrowth. In that period it was discovered that the restaurant had power generators, an independent water system with a well and pools of drinking water and a soundproof room, apparently used for listening and taping of the guests. In the 2010s, a local investor purchased the edifice, demolished the ruined remains and built a new building in the traditional style. It is expected that the restaurant will be reopened in 2018.\n\nThere are over 80 archaeological sites on the territory of Grocka, which point to the long and continuous habitation of the area. The 1974 digging at the location of the Rančić Family House produced artifacts and fragments from the Neolithic Starčevo and Vinča cultures (including fragments of the figurines), non-enamel ceramics from the 15th century, Turkish ceramics from the 16th-18th century and various objects from the 19th-20th century.\n\nThe area on which Grocka is located was once part of limes, a border defense system of Ancient Rome. The remains of several watch-towers and small forts were found in nearby villages along the banks of the Danube River. The municipality of Grocka is the richest in archaeological localities of all the Belgrade municipalities, but they are also among the least explored. Only in the village of Brestovik there are three localities: \"Podunavlje-Hladna Voda-Vrtlog-Mikulje\" Localities Complex (under preliminary protection), \"Beli Breg\" and \"Goli Breg.\" Artifacts from Goli Breg are being kept in the National Museum in Belgrade and Museum of the city of Belgrade. Roman tomb in Brestovik, an ancient tomb, dating from c. 300, was discovered in 1895. Though evidence points to the tomb of a wealthy local, popular belief is that the \"martyrs of Singidunum\", Hermylus and Stratonicus, were buried inside. As one of the most important monuments from the Late Roman period in Belgrade and Serbia, the tomb has been protected since 1948. There are also Stones of Brestovik, which were transported into the yard of the Rančić Family house in Grocka in 2017. Preliminary examination showed that the stones are indeed archaeological artifacts. Based on their size, details, and robust frame, it is believed that they were part of some monumental construction from the Roman Antiquity period. Reliefs, or the \"stone plastics\", are still visible and they form a singular pattern on all three stones. That points to the conclusion that they are either segments of a sacral architecture, but more likely of a large public building, most certainly built before the 4th century, from the period of the golden age of the nearby Singidunum, modern Belgrade.\n\nRoman forts, built to protect the Via Militaris road in the vicinity include \"Tricornium\", in modern Ritopek, and \"Mutatio ad Sextum Militare\", in Grocka itself.\n\nThe town was mentioned for the first time in 878, under the Slavic name Gardec, in the list of settlements by the local Bulgarian bishop. The present settlement was established in 1550 and given the title of \"varošica\" (\"small town\").\n\nThe town has a historical main street (čaršija) with shops, green market and a small administrative center, which has been turned into a pedestrian zone.\n\nAn annual festival \"Gročanske svečanosti\" (Grocka festivities) has been held since the 1960s. Fruit producers and artists meet in čaršija, while musical performances, sports tournaments, theatrical shows, and a fish soup cooking contest are held. The 50th \"Gročanske svečanosti\" were held in July–August 2017 and to mark the occasion, a sculpture of \"Gročanka\" (Girl from Grocka), which symbolizes the fruit production, was dedicated.\n\nTourist attractions include several old edifices from the 18th and 19th century: House of Apostolović, House of Nišli, Savić Mehana, Rančić Family House and House of Karapešić.\n\n\nGrocka is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

It is native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is now grown throughout the world in gardens, especially for its bluish leaves, and sometimes for its tolerance of hot and dry soil conditions. It is also cultivated as a medicinal herb, as a condiment, and to a lesser extent as an insect repellent.\n\nThe specific epithet \"graveolens\" refers to the strong-smelling leaves.\n\nIn the ancient Roman world, the naturalists Pedanius Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder recommended that rue be combined with the poisonous shrub oleander to be drunk as an antidote to poisonous snake bites.\nThe \"Tacuinum Sanitatis\", a medieval handbook on wellness, lists these properties of rue:\nThe refined oil of rue is an emmenagogue and was cited by the Roman historian Pliny the Elder and the gynecologist Soranus as a potent abortifacient (inducing abortion).{Natural History Book XX Ch LI}\nRue has a culinary use, but since it is bitter and gastric discomfort may be experienced by some individuals, it is used sparingly. Although used more extensively in former times, it is not a herb that is typically found in modern cuisine. Today it is largely unknown to the general public and most chefs, and unavailable in grocery stores. It is a component of berbere, the characteristic Ethiopian spice mixture, and as such is encountered in Ethiopian cuisine. Also in Ethiopia, fresh rue is dipped in coffee before drinking it.\n\nIt has a variety of other culinary uses:\n\nRue is also grown as an ornamental plant, both as a low hedge and so the leaves can be used in nosegays.\n\nMost cats dislike the smell of it, and it can, therefore, be used as a deterrent to them (see also \"Plectranthus caninus\").\n\nCaterpillars of some subspecies of the butterfly \"Papilio machaon\" feed on rue, as well as other plants. The caterpillars of \"Papilio xuthus\" also feed readily on it.\n\nIn South India, rue is recommended for home gardens to repel snakes (however the effectiveness is unknown).\n\nRue is also a common ingredient in witchcraft and spell making. During the Middle Ages it was a symbol of recognition between witches. The Catholic Church also used a branch of rue to sprinkle holy water on its followers during this time known as the \"herb of grace.\" Hasidic Jews also were taught that rue should be placed into amulets to be protected from epidemics and plagues. This was taught by Rabbi Isaac of Komarno in his comments to \"Sefer Adam Yashar\" in the name of Rabbi Isaac Luria.\n\nRue extracts are mutagenic and hepatotoxic. Large doses can cause violent gastric pain, vomiting, systemic complications, and death.\n\nExposure to common rue, or herbal preparations derived from it, can cause severe phytophotodermatitis which results in burn-like blisters on the skin.\nA series of furanoacridones and two acridone alkaloids (arborinine and evoxanthine) have been isolated from \"R. graveolens\". It also contains coumarins and limonoids.\n\nCell cultures produce the coumarins umbelliferone, scopoletin, psoralen, xanthotoxin, isopimpinellin, rutamarin and rutacultin, and the alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine, 6-methoxydictamnine and edulinine.\n\nThe ethyl acetate extract of \"R. graveolens\" leaves yields two furanocoumarins, one quinoline alkaloid and four quinolone alkaloids.\n\nThe chloroform extracts of the root, stem and leaf shows the isolation of the furanocoumarin chalepensin.\n\nThe essential oil of \"R. graveolens\" contains two main constituents, undecan-2-one (46.8%) and nonan-2-one (18.8%).\n\nThe bitter taste of its leaves led to rue being associated with the (etymologically unrelated) verb \"rue\" \"to regret\". \nRue is well known for its symbolic meaning of regret and it has sometimes been called \"herb-of-grace\" in literary works. It is one of the flowers distributed by the mad Ophelia in William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (IV.5):\n\nIt was planted by the gardener in \"Richard II\" to mark the spot where the Queen wept upon hearing news of Richard's capture (III.4.104–105):\n\nIt is also given by the rusticated Perdita to her disguised royal father-in-law on the occasion of a sheep-shearing (Winter's Tale, IV.4):\n\nIt is used by Michael in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" to give Adam clear sight (11.414): \n\nRue is used by Gulliver in \"Gulliver's Travels\" (by Jonathan Swift) when he returns to England after living among the \"Houyhnhnms\". Gulliver can no longer stand the smell of the English Yahoos (people), so he stuffs rue or tobacco in his nose to block out the smell. \"I was at last bold enough to walk the street in his (Don Pedro's) company, but kept my nose well with rue, or sometimes with tobacco\".\n\nRue is mentioned in the Bible, Luke 11.42: \"But woe unto you, Pharisees! For ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs\".\n\nIn mythology, the basilisk, whose breath could cause plants to wilt and stones to crack, had no effect on rue. Weasels who were bitten by the basilisk would retreat and eat rue in order to recover and return to fight. \nRue is considered a national herb of Lithuania and it is the most frequently referenced herb in Lithuanian folk songs, as an attribute of young girls, associated with virginity and maidenhood. It was common in traditional Lithuanian weddings for only virgins to wear a rue (ruta) at their wedding, a symbol to show their purity. Likewise, rue is prominent in Ukrainian folklore, songs and culture.\n\nIn the Ukrainian folk song \"Oi poli ruta, ruta\" (O, rue, rue in the field), the girl regrets losing her virginity, reproaching the lover for \"breaking the green hazel tree\". \"\"Una Matica de Ruda\"\" is a traditional Sephardic wedding song.\n\n\"Chervona Ruta\" (Червона Рута—\"Red Rue\") is a song, written by Volodymyr Ivasyuk, a popular Ukrainian poet and composer. Pop singer Sofia Rotaru performed the song in 1971.\n\n\n"}

He was also Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha between 1988 - 1990 and 1994 - 2000. His involvement was at a high level in the Indian National Congress. He was elected Chief Minister of Bihar three times. After his brother L.N Mishra's assassination, Jagannath Mishra became Bihar's most powerful Congress leader in the late seventies and eighties. Prior to the emergence of Lalu Prasad Yadav in 1990, Jagannath, was rated as the biggest mass leader in the Congress. He was affectionately called as \"Doctor Sahib\". He was also referred to as \"Maulana\" Jagannath because of his clout with the Muslims that he had earned by making Urdu as the second official language of the state in 1980.\n\nMishra supported and practiced populism, and had earned popularity among the teachers by taking over hundreds of private primary, middle and high schools across the state in 1977. After leaving Congress, he joined the Nationalist Congress Party and later the Janata Dal (United). On 30 September 2013, a special Central Bureau of Investigation court in Ranchi convicted him, along with 44 others, in the Fodder Scam. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment and a fine of 200,000 rupees. On 25 October 2013, the Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Mishra in fodder scam case Mishra maintained his name was deliberately included in the scam on the instruction of the Congress president Sitaram Kesri.\nDr. Mishra was acquitted in two fodder scam cases on 23 December 2017 and 19 March 2018 In two cases his Appeal is pending in Jharkhand High Court.[Cr. App. (SJ) 838 of 2013 and Cr. App. (SJ) 268 of 2018]\n\nMishra began his career as a lecturer and later became professor of economics at Bihar University. On 23 July 1983, he made a two-hour statement in the Bihar State Assembly in which he criticized the Centre. Among the charges he made against the Centre were that the state mined 40 per cent of the country's minerals but only got 14 per cent of the royalty earned. He claimed that he had \"strongly pleaded with the Centre that the policy should be changed\". He added that \"the Centre is the buyer of our mineral products. It does not look nice that the consumer should also fix royalty rates. he second charge was that the financial institutions were not being fair to the state. Jagannath had stated \"I have told the chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India to invest more in Bihar. I have also told the financial institutions in plain words that for everything we would not go to the Centre\". \nFor the Congress(I) high command, the criticsm was an uncommon show of independence. Almost immediately Jagannath was summoned to Delhi and resigned on 14 August 1983.\n\nOn 31 July 1982, Mishra’s government successfully pushed through the State Legislative Assembly the amendments of Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 455 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) collectively called the Bihar Press Bill. Adopted amid pandemonium in the state legislature, the Bihar Press Bill prohibited the publication, sale and possession of any printed matter that was \"scurrilous\" or \"grossly indecent\" or \"intended for blackmail.\n\nMishra maintained that while he supported a free press as necessary and vital to a democracy, it must be controlled if one section of it acts irresponsibly. Citing instances of \"character assassination\" in the press that would damage the government's credibility, he said that he expected commitment to national goals and aspirations from journalists. Addressing a Congress-I Party meeting in Lucknow, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said she had not read the Bihar Press Bill but understood from government lawyers that it contains nothing to gag the press. She warned that the government could not allow any segment of society, including the press, to misuse constitutional freedom of expression and that just as the constitution does not allow anyone to commit murder, no reporter could be allowed to engage in character assassination.\n\nIn an unprecedented collective challenge to government attempts to curb press freedom, most of India's 10,000 newspapers shut down in protest of the anti-press measure adopted in Bihar and supported by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Journalists throughout the country walked out of their newspapers to protest what they regarded as \"creeping\" state censorship reminiscent of the tough emergency regulations imposed by Gandhi between 1975 and 1977. Exactly one year after the Bihar Assembly passed Jagannath's strict measure, the chief minister moved a motion in the Assembly withdrawing the bill - even as it was waiting for presidential assent. For the first time in the constitutional history of the country a bill awaiting presidential assent had been withdrawn.\n\nIn an interview to \"The Indian Express\" in 2017, Mishra said he regretted the decision of bringing the bill — which he claims was taken to keep PM Indira Gandhi in good humour “at the peak of her differences with Maneka Gandhi”.“I admit that I should not have brought the Bihar Press Bill,” Mishra told The Indian Express from Delhi. “I did so to keep then PM Indira Gandhi in good humour. During one of my visits to Delhi, I saw Indira in a pensive mood. She was upset with reports about the differences between her and Maneka Gandhi. She had been getting bad press. She asked me if I can bring a bill on the lines of Tamil Nadu and Orissa and asked me to meet then information and broadcasting minister Vasant Sathe, who gave me a detailed brief. I went back and brought the Bihar Press Bill on 31 July 1982.”\n\nOn 10 June 1980, during his first cabinet meeting of his second term as Chief Minister of Bihar, Mishra promised to get the state Official Language Act amended to make Urdu the second official language of the State. At the time, Bihar was one of the few states that was contemplating giving Urdu an official status. Only in Jammu and Kashmir, where Urdu is the official medium, and Hyderabad before the army action in 1948 had given the language this kind of recognition. \nOn 19 September 1980, Jagannath Mishra led state government notified Urdu as the second official language of the state.\n\nHe wrote many research papers and also authored and edited a number of books.\n\nMishra lived in Patna. Mishra's wife Veena died on 22 January 2018 at Delhi's Medanta hospital. She was 72 and was undergoing treatment for respiratory complications. His elder brother, Lalit Narayan Mishra, served as the Railway Minister of India between 1973 and 1975 when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister. Jagannath Mishra's son, Nitish Mishra, is also a politician and has served as cabinet minister in the Government of Bihar.\n\nMishra died on 19 August 2019 at the age of 82 years, after a prolonged illness in a Delhi hospital. After his death, a three day state mourning was declared in Bihar. He was cremated with full State honours in Balua Bazar, his ancestral village in Supaul district.\n"}

It features improved performance via methods such as just-in-time compilation and adaptive optimization.\n\nThe Java HotSpot Performance Engine was released on April 27, 1999, built on technologies from an implementation of the programming language Smalltalk named Strongtalk, originally developed by Longview Technologies, which traded as Animorphic. The Longview virtual machine was based on the Self virtual machine, with an interpreter replacing the fast-and-dumb first compiler. When Sun cancelled the Self project, two key people, Urs Hölzle and Lars Bak left Sun to start Longview. In 1997, Sun Microsystems purchased Animorphic.\n\nShortly after acquiring Animorphic, Sun decided to write a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Java virtual machine.\nThis new compiler would give rise to the name \"HotSpot\", derived from the software's behavior: as it runs Java bytecode, as with the Self VM, HotSpot continually analyzes the program's performance for \"hot spots\" which are executed often or repeatedly. These are then targeted for optimizing, leading to high-performance execution with a minimum of overhead for less performance-critical code. In one report, the JVM beat some C++ or C code in some benchmarks.\n\nInitially available as an add-on for Java 1.2, HotSpot became the default Sun JVM in Java 1.3.\n\nJRE (originally from Sun, now from Oracle) features two virtual machines, one called \"Client\" and the other \"Server\". The Client version is tuned for quick loading. It makes use of interpretation. The Server version loads more slowly, putting more effort into producing highly optimized JIT compilations to yield higher performance. Both VMs compile only often-run methods, using a configurable invocation-count threshold to decide which methods to compile.\n\nTiered compiling, an option introduced in Java 7, uses both the client and server compilers in tandem to provide faster startup time than the server compiler, but similar or better peak performance. Starting in Java 8, tiered compilation is the default for the server VM.\n\nHotSpot is written in C++. In 2007, Sun estimated it comprised approximately 250,000 lines of source code. Hotspot provides:\n\nHotSpot supports many command-line arguments for options of the virtual machine execution. Some are standard and must be found in any conforming Java virtual machine; others are specific to HotSpot and may not be found in other JVMs (options that begin with -X or -XX are non-standard).\n\nOn 13 November 2006, the HotSpot JVM and the Java Development Kit (JDK) were licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. This is the code that became part of Java 7.).\n\nAs with the entire Java Development Kit (JDK), HotSpot is supported by Oracle Corporation on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Solaris. Supported instruction set architectures (ISAs) are IA-32, x86-64, ARMv7 VFP, ARMv8 and SPARC (Solaris only).\n\nPorts are also available by third parties for various other Unix operating systems. Several different hardware architectures are supported, including x86, PowerPC, and SPARC (Solaris only).\n\nPorting HotSpot is difficult as the code, while mostly written in C++, contains much assembly language. To remedy this, the IcedTea project has developed a generic port of the HotSpot interpreter called \"zero-assembler Hotspot\" (or \"zero\"), with almost no assembly code. This port is intended for easy adaptation of the interpreter component of HotSpot to any Linux processor architecture. The code of \"zero-assembler Hotspot\" is used for all the non-x86 architecture ports of HotSpot (PowerPC, Itanium (IA-64), S390 and ARM) since version 1.6.\n\n\n"}

He had arrived in the colony in 1795 on HMS \"Reliance\" and became friendly with midshipman Matthew Flinders and on arrival they decided to explore parts of the colony. In 1796 on a small boat called the \"Tom Thumb\" accompanied by a boy servant William Martin, they sailed into Botany Bay and explored the Georges River, twenty miles (32 km) beyond previous expeditions. They sailed as far as present day Georges Hall. For their exploration efforts Bass and Flinders were rewarded with land grants in this area by Governor Hunter.\n\nThe area developed rapidly after the completion of Liverpool Road in 1814. Originally known as Irish Town because of the Irish settlements, it later became known as Upper Bankstown. It became officially known as Bass Hill in October 1924.\n\nDuring World War II, Bass Hill was the location for a small transmitting station that was owned and operated by the RAAF. It was located on the corner of Manuka Crescent & Johnston Road. This facility worked in conjunction with the Bankstown Bunker on Black Charlies Hill in Condell Park, which also worked in conjunction with a remote receiving station that was located in Picnic Point.\n\nBass Hill Plaza is a , district size shopping centre at 753 Hume Highway. The shopping centre includes a Woolworths Supermarket, Kmart, Aldi, Medical Centre, Post Office and approximately 60 specialty stores.\n\nAdjacent to the centre a new residential housing estate, Viewpoint, is being developed on the former Bass Hill drive-in cinema.\n\nBass Hill has three schools, Bass Hill Public School for years K-6, George Bass School for students with special needs and Bass High School for years 7-12.\n\nBass Hill is home to many sporting fields and facilities which cater for sports such as athletics, cricket, cycling, hockey, rugby league and soccer. \n\nThe Crest sporting complex contains the Dunc Gray Velodrome which was home of the track cycling events for the 2000 Summer Olympics and the Cycling World Cup, a state of the art athletics complex, soccer fields, hockey fields and cricket fields. The Crest was home to the Sydney Bulls Jim Beam Cup Rugby League Club, South West Strikers Soccer Club, Bankstown District Sports Club Hockey Club, Banksports Athletics, Bankstown Sports Cycling Club and Bankstown Sports Gymnastics.\n\nIn the 2016 census the population of Bass Hill was 9,069, 50.7% female and 49.3% male.\n\nThe median age of the Bass Hill population was 34 years, 4 years below the national median of 38.\n\n58.5% of people were born in Australia.

It is found in Colombia, Venezuela, and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, and Puerto Rico. Previously part of a superspecies simply named the troupial, it was recently split together with the orange-backed troupial and Campo troupial.\n\nVenezuelan troupials are fairly large in size, with a long tail and a bulky bill. It has a black head and upper breast. The feathers on the front of the neck and upper breast stick outward, making an uneven boundary between the black and the orange of the bird's lower breast and underside. The rest of the orange color is found on the upper and lower back, separated by the black shoulders. The wings are mostly black except for a white streak that runs the length of the wing when in a closed position. The eyes are yellow, and surrounding each one, there is a patch of bright, blue, naked skin. Former Miss International Edymar Martínez wore the image as a national costume in 2015 in Tokyo, Japan, representing as the national bird of Venezuela.\n\nIt appears on the reverse side of the Venezuelan 500 bolívar soberano note.\n\nThere are three subspecies: \"I. i. icterus\", \"I. i. ridgwayi\", and \"I. i. metai\". Individuals of \"I. i. metae\" have more orange on the back and a black line that divides the lengthwise white wing-stripe in half. Individuals of \"I. i. ridgwayi\" are generally stronger and larger in proportion to the other subspecies.\n\nVenezuelan troupial inhabit dry areas like woodlands, gallery forest, dry scrub, plains, and open savanna where they forage for insects, a wide variety of fruit, small birds and eggs.\n\nVenezuelan troupials breed from March to September. They do not construct their own nests, but are instead obligate nest pirates. This means that they make no nest of their own, but instead must either find a vacant nest, or must drive the adults away from an active nest. Venezuelan troupials are capable of violent attacks against established nesters. Upon taking over a nest, they may eat any eggs or young nestlings remaining in the newly acquired nest, and will fiercely defend the area against would-be intruders. Eventually the adult turpials go on to produce their own clutch of three to four eggs that hatch after about two weeks of incubation.\n\n\n"}

The Doctor knows this planet all too well, and refuses to interfere in events that will become the birth of the Cybermen.\n\n\nUncredited:\n\nA radio announcer declares that after six years training Crewman Donald Philpott will become the first human to set foot on the surface of Mondas since the inhabitants were forced to retreat underground. Once Philpott emerges, however, his heartbeat and breathing increase rapidly until, screaming, he is overcome by the vastness of the universe. Months or years later, the Doctor and Nyssa have arrived in what strongly resembles a 1950s London street, but in a huge cavern. They separate to explore. Nyssa encounters Mr Hartley, a Mat-catcher who traps wild Cybermats, and his daughter Yvonne. With curfew approaching, they insist on taking Nyssa home with them. Meanwhile, the Doctor finds his way into the shop of Thomas Dodd, a dealer in human body parts for transplant. Dodd confirms the Doctor’s suspicion that the planet he has landed on is indeed Mondas, and explains that the population is down to a few thousand in a single underground city. Mondas has drifted so far from any star that the surface is no longer habitable. The Doctor intends to return to the TARDIS, but Dodd tries to stop him as curfew has fallen. Outside the shop they encounter a cybernetic Policeman, a primitive cyborg, similar to but not yet as advanced as a Cyberman, who tries to arrest them for breaking curfew. The Doctor and Dodd flee. Back at the Hartley’s, Yvonne, her father and Nyssa discover Sisterman Constant, a medical official who works as a Selector, is visiting. She is choosing candidates to become Crewmen (i.e. Cybermen), to work on the propulsion system on the surface of the planet. Constant is highly suspicious of Nyssa, and later reports the stranger’s presence to her superiors. Elsewhere, the Doctor and Dodd are puzzled by heavy traffic movement. After climbing the tower of the abandoned Church of Former-Day Souls they discover the Police are digging up the graveyard for body parts. They are attacked by a Policeman, who the Doctor kills by pushing it into the church clock mechanism. He then sets the bell tolling, summoning the population. He hopes that, when they discover what is going on, the people will force the government to change the direction of their work, thus stopping the development of the Cybermen. At the Hartley’s a Police squad arrive in search of Nyssa. She flees, after Yvonne gives Nyssa her pet Cybermat, Matty, as a present. Meanwhile, the Central Committee have decided that the Doctor and Nyssa must be found and eliminated as insurgents.\n\nReunited, the Doctor and Nyssa argue over what to do. Nyssa believes that they should intervene to stop the creation of the Cybermen. The Doctor maintains that they must not interfere – he hopes that his ‘wake-up call’ with the church bell will be sufficient to make the Mondasians change their own future. However, the Police have used force to crush the unrest. In any case, the TARDIS is trapped as Matty has escaped and severed the energy conduit in the console. At the Committee Palace hospital ward, Doctorman Allan, the Surgeon-General of Mondas and chief medical officer in charge of the Cyberman programme, is becoming increasingly cynical about the project. She is short of resources, and most of the Cybermen survive barely a week as their bodies' immune systems reject the cybernetic implants. Meanwhile, Frank, Yvonne’s brother, arrives at the TARDIS and tells Nyssa that Yvonne has received her call-up papers – in other words, she has been taken to be converted into a Cyberman. The Doctor leaves to make another attempt to stir up insurrection, causing a truck-load of bones from the graveyard to lose its load in public. The Committee decide to summon Commander Zheng, the leading Cyberman, from the surface to restore order. The Doctor approaches Dodd, hoping he knows a way into the Committee Palace, but Dodd – planning to steal the Doctor’s undamaged body-parts – locks him in his freezer. However, a security Cybermat has observed the Doctor at Dodd’s shop, and a squad of Policemen arrive. They intend to kill the Doctor, but Allan stops them, taking him and Dodd into her own custody in the belief that the Doctor could prove useful. At the home of the Hartleys, Nyssa observes the new ‘Crewmen’ being paraded on television, and is horrified to see that they are fully processed Cybermen. However, a sudden power-failure throughout the city causes mass panic. The latest batch of Cybermen, including Yvonne, become out-of-control as the systems have shut down before processing was complete. The Doctor realises that Mondas is entering the Cherrybowl Nebula, a large tract of unstable Space, with the result that the destruction of Mondas is imminent.\n\nDebris caused by planetary-wide turbulence crushes the Police Escort of the Doctor and Dodd, allowing them to escape into the shelter of the Palace. There, Constant is attempting to restrain the half-processed Cybermen, but one of them – Yvonne – has escaped. Allan goes to try to restore power to the Central Committee. She encounters the Doctor – Dodd having run off in terror – who offers to help. As they are searching for a way to restore power to the City, the Doctor discovers the truth behind the Committee: twenty of Mondas’s finest thinkers permanently plugged into a giant computer. Back in the hospital ward, one of the semi-processed Cybermen, wrongly believing that Constant is withholding important data, attacks her. However, Commander Zheng arrives and kills the rogue Crewman. His squad take the semi-processed Cybermen into custody until processing can be completed, and sends an appalled Constant to be cyber-converted as a way of ‘healing’ the injuries caused by her attacker. He then goes to consult with the Committee, and oversees the Doctor’s and Allan’s attempts to restore power. As the Doctor closes the final circuit Zheng reactivates the power before the Doctor is clear, apparently killing him. At the Hartley apartment, a distressed Yvonne forces her way in, the remnant of her humanity reminding her that she wanted her father to see her in her ‘uniform’ before she joined the work crews. Mr Hartley, Frank and Nyssa are horrified when they realise who the Cyberman is. However, with the power back on the processing automatically starts to complete. Away from the hospital support, Yvonne’s body is unable to cope and she dies. Shortly afterwards a Policeman arrives and arrests Nyssa. Meanwhile, the Doctor has recovered consciousness. Allan is astonished by his physical resilience, surviving an electric shock from generators big enough to power several cities, and is convinced he is the solution to the destabilising Cybermen. A scan reveals that the Doctor has an additional lobe to his brain, not present in humans, which deals with all bodily functions. Allan realises she can reproduce this in all future Cybermen, which will prevent their bodies rejecting the cybernetic implants. The Committee instructs her to proceed, declaring that from now on the Cybermen will be invincible.\n\nAs the Doctor is prepared for a scan to produce the necessary template for the new Cybermen, the Committee decides, in spite of Zheng’s doubts, that the entire population must be processed. To achieve maximum efficiency, the Committee abandons all remnants of individuality and adopts a single persona, the ‘Cyberplanner’. Meanwhile, a shocked Allan protests at the plan to convert all Mondasians, but Zheng, obeying the Cyberplanner’s instructions, relieves her of her duties and takes command himself. However, Zheng is increasingly doubtful of the Cyberplanner’s intentions. His Cybermen have been building a propulsion unit on the surface of Mondas capable of sending the planet on a reverse trajectory out of the Cherrybowl Nebula. The Cyberplanner, though, is insisting that the power necessary to operate the propulsion unit must be directed into processing the population. A large force of Cybermen is despatched to herd the populace – including Mr Hartley and Frank – into the Palace for conversion. They resist at first, but the turbulence caused by entering the Nebula is causing the cavern ceiling to start to collapse, and the Hartleys flee inside for safety. Back in the hospital ward the Doctor has vanished. Believing the Doctor has been tricked, Nyssa is appalled to be confronted by a Cyberman which she believes to be him. However, the Doctor reappears, and Allan reveals that the Cyberman is actually Thomas Dodd. Realising that every Cyberman he has ever met or ever will meet is based on himself the Doctor is more determined than ever to stop them. The Palace still has a large wine cellar, and the Doctor decides to pour the wine into the nutrient vats which feed the Cyberplanner, causing it to malfunction. Allan goes to warn the Cyberplanner, but Zheng intervenes, finally having decided that the safety of the planet takes priority over the safety of its government. Another Cyberman tries to stop the Doctor and Nyssa, but the Hartleys, having escaped, attack the cyborg and throw it into the nutrient vat. Zheng and Allan arrive in the Committee Chamber. The Cyberplanner refuses to believe the nutrients have been poisoned, and Allan is taken away to be processed whilst Zheng argues with the Cyberplanner. As Zheng moves to activate the propulsion unit the Cyberplanner shoots him. Elsewhere, the Hartleys realise that they can convert the generators into a giant ‘cheeser’ – a device to attract Cybermats – causing a massive swarm which will attack the Cyberplanner. They complete their work but are captured and sent for processing. To give them time, the Doctor had also allowed himself to be captured and taken before the Cyberplanner. Thanks to its slipping faculties (caused by the wine), the Doctor is able to engage the Cyberplanner in a discussion on Mondasian history, delaying it until the Cybermats arrive. When they do, the swarm kills the Cyberplanner, allowing the dying Zheng to activate the propulsion unit. Some time later, the Doctor and Nyssa leave, believing that, whilst they have not stopped the Cybermen, they have redirected their evolution into something good. Mr Hartley has been put in charge of reconstructing the ceiling, with the work carried out by Cybermen. Processing has been halted, and the Doctor has provided Allan with instructions on how to partially reverse the conversion. As she works at her desk, however, assisted by the Cyberman version of Constant, Zheng – who she believed dead – walks in and announces, “Doctorman Allan. We begin again.” It is apparent that the Doctor and Nyssa have, ultimately, failed to change the future.\n\nMarc Platt was reluctant to write a Cyberman story, as he felt their plausibility as a convincing villain over the history of the series had declined too markedly. However, he realised that by writing an origin story, he could go right back to the basics of what the Cybermen had originally been intended to be by Kit Pedler, which he felt were a far scarier concept than the later incarnations.\n\nPlatt was determined that the story should be a tragedy. Unlike the Daleks, which were aliens driven by Nazi-like beliefs, the Mondasians were very much human. \"Spare Parts\" thus became a story of how humans could become so desperate that they would reject their humanity – even their emotions – to survive.\n\nBecause of these close links to the original concept for the Cybermen, there are various references to the first Cyberman story, \"The Tenth Planet\". The sing-song voices of the Cybermen are the same as used in that episode, and references to cloth masks indicate that they are the same design of Cyberman. The Cyberplanner expands on the brief description of Mondasian history in the television story. Marc Platt has stated that Eric Krailford, mentioned several times though never appearing, is intended to be the human who will eventually become Cyberman Krail from \"The Tenth Planet\". The death of Adric in \"Earthshock\", indirectly caused by the Cybermen, is alluded to several times. The concept of a planetary propulsion unit on the surface of Mondas was derived from \"Attack of the Cybermen\".\n\nRoger Lloyd-Pack was originally approached to play Mr Hartley, but was unable to. Eventually he was cast as the creator of the alternate universe Cybermen in \"Rise of the Cybermen\". Pamela Binns agreed to play Sisterman Constant partly because she rarely had the chance to play villains. Constant is not strictly a villain, but certainly not wholly on the side of good (at least from the Doctor’s point of view). Sally Knyvette made being allowed to bring her dog to the studio a condition of playing Doctorman Allan. Derren Nesbitt had a history of being cast in \"Doctor Who\", having played villainous warlord Tegana in the 1964 First Doctor serial \"Marco Polo\". Nicholas Briggs has done a lot of work for Big Finish, most notably writing and voicing the Daleks for the Dalek Empire series. He also provides most of the monster voices for the new TV series, including the Cybermen.\n\nReaction to \"Spare Parts\" has largely been very positive, and the story is often considered the definitive version of the origins of the Cybermen amongst fans.\n\nIn his introduction to \"Big Finish: The Inside Story\", Russell T Davies called this story (along with \"The Holy Terror\") \"some of the finest drama ever written for any genre, in any medium, anywhere\". Consequently, it became the inspiration for one of the new TV series stories: the two-part story \"Rise of the Cybermen\"/\"The Age of Steel\" was inspired by this story, and that Marc Platt received a fee for the reused story elements; he was credited in the programme's end titles. However, writer Tom MacRae noted that his television story was not a simple rewrite of \"Spare Parts\": \"My story isn't the same — it's got a different setting, different themes, and different characters, [because] once we started talking, the whole thing developed in a very different direction. But as Russell says, we wouldn't have started this whole line of thinking if he hadn't heard \"Spare Parts\" in the first place.\" \"Spare Parts\" takes place on the planet Mondas of the regular Doctor Who universe, rather than the parallel Earth of \"Rise of the Cybermen\", and the two stories feature two entirely separate races of Cybermen.\n\nIn the revived Series 10 finale \"World Enough and Time\"/\"The Doctor Falls\", the Twelfth Doctor and his companions encounter an alternate 'Genesis of the Cybermen', as it is described by The Master, onboard a colony ship that originated from Mondas. The Doctor however, corrects the Master by describing the Cybermen as an example of 'parallel evolution', mentioning several planets of origin of the Cybermen, including Mondas.\n\nBriggs reprised the role of Zheng for the character’s cameo in the Sixth Doctor audio drama \"The Reaping\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800943", "title": "Santa Reparata, Florence", "text": "Santa Reparata, Florence\n\nSanta Reparata is the former cathedral of Florence, Italy. Its name refers to Saint Reparata, an early virgin martyr who is the co-patron saint of Florence. Florence Cathedral was constructed over it.\n\nEver since the 3rd century there was an area in the north of Florence which was dedicated to Christianity and up to the Middle Ages represented the most important religious center of the city. From the 6th century onwards, a building complex called 'the sacred axis' was constructed in east-west direction (from the Piazza dell'Olio to the area of the apsis of the Duomo), which was traditionally considered the cult area in Late Antiquity, protected by existing Roman walls. The place included the Bishop's palace, the Baptistery of San Giovanni, a hospital, a parsonage, a graveyard, and three churches: \"Salvatore al Vescovo\", \"San Michele Visdomini\" and \"Santa Reparata\". The main point within the sacred axis was Santa Reparata, a sacral building of paleo-Christian origin which was probably the first construction of this building complex. The bones of Saint Zenobius (born about 328) were transferred to Santa Reparata at an unidentified time (according to most scientists it happened in the 9th century). At this time Santa Reparata became the new seat of the bishop, which had been in Basilica of San Lorenzo before that time.\n\nThe oldest legends are related to one single event, the invasion of the Ostrogoths under Radagaisus:\n\nThis last legend was important for the dating of the building. Still, the episode of the bone transferral is dated to the 9th century by most scientists, because the version according to which the transfer occurred in the 5th century is based on a tale by bishop Andrew, who in turn attributed the legend to the Milanese bishop Simplicianus, who, according to Andrew, wrote a biography of the saint. This biography turned out to be a fake written around 1130.\n\nEven though distinct proof does not exist, historians generally date the transfer to the 9th century, based on Andrew's version.\n\nNeither are the other two legends about the origin based on solid evidence because the victory over Radagaisus happened in August 405 or 406, but Santa Reparata is celebrated on the 8th of \"October\". At any rate, in 1353 the local authorities, the \"Signoria\", officially accepted the legend that the church was built in honor of Santa Reparata.\n\nThere were six distinct excavation campaigns between 1965 and 1974. A last excavation between the baptistery and stairway of the dome was conducted from 1971 to 1972. The discovery of the remains of Santa Reparata has delivered the most concrete evidence of the early Christian age in Florence, which has not been well documented previously. The evidence found before that time includes the excavations in 1948 in Santa Felicita, the notes about San Lorenzo cited by Paolino da Milano in his biography of Abrosius and some tombstones and sarcophagi, but little else.\n\nThe excavations were studied by the Canadian Franklin Toker and by da Morozzi, who have published their results. Toker based his work on studies conducted by the archeologist E. Galli during the first two decades of the 19th century. Toker continued the comparative studies undertaken by Galli with tombs that were rediscovered in the area before the baptistery. These tombs are no longer exhibited, but Galli published an account of his research. After reading the conclusions of Toker, Busignani found several inconsistencies that put some question marks to the dating of the levels that was based on the tombs. It is safer to base the research on the dating of coins that were discovered in the Roman soil between the layers of Santa Reparata.\n\nAll the coins that were found in the Roman soil belonged to a time frame from the era of emperor Gordianus III (238 to 244) and the reign of emperor Honorius (395 – 423). There is also a glass object, an S-shaped goblet, that was found in a tomb that was inserted in the mosaic pavement of the basilica, and therefore is dated later than the mosaic. By way of comparison with analogous finds which have reliable proofs for their dating, the goblet is dated to the end of the seventh century at the latest. At last, regarding these finds in the Roman soil, one can say that they are to be dated earlier than the 4th century. One can also conclude that at the end of the seventh or eighth century already the tiled floor with the mosaic needed to be partially renovated because the glass object was found in a tomb that was put in a zone where the floor had holes. This, according to Busignani, is sufficient evidence to maintain that the basilica was built at the end of the fourth century or during the first decades of the following century, after the victory of the Roman army over Radagaisus.\n\nThe excavations have cast some light onto the floor plan of the first church, which featured the large mosaic. Also the changes that were made later to the subsequent reconstructions and rebuildings are based on this floor plan. In its original setting, Santa Reparata presented itself as a basilica with three naves, that were separated by fourteen pairs of columns. It had semi-circular apses, which could be dated to the end of the fourth century because of the typical paleo-Christian iconography of basilicas from the age of Constantine. In Florence works with this iconography are at Santa Felicita, and probably some works in San Lorenzo date back to that age.\n\nIt is not clear whether the columns carried arches or an entablature; the width of the space between the columns, which is 3.19 metres, would make arches more likely. Not all of the basilica was excavated; the first part, about four columns wide, were dug up underneath the church square and the stairway of Santa Maria del Fiore.\n\nThis conclusion is due to the finding of the foundations and the arcades that were attached to the front of Santa Reparata at a distance of 13 metres from the facade of the dome. Including this area, the measurements of Santa Reparata appeared to be remarkable: a length of 58,5 metres on the inside, including the apsis, a width of 25 to 26 metres for the oblique north wall. Santa Maria del Fiore is 153 metres long, about 38 metres wide, the length of the crossing nave is 90 metres, the height up to the lantern is 86.7 metres.\n\nThe most significant find is the great mosaic which paved all of the basilica, it was found in the left nave, in most of the middle nave and also in the right nave. There are different designs next to each other, among which, next to the usual four leafed rosettes and nods in circles or octagons (accompanied by Christian symbols like a Latin cross and a goblet), is the especially intricate coats of arms with lozenges inscribed between them that take up most space in the middle nave; in it, an epigraph with the names of 14 sponsors is inscribed. The image of a peacock is of remarkable quality between (?) the emblem in the center of the adjacent panel with the name of the sponsor Obsequentius. The motifs of the pavement belong to the usual repertoire of the era of the Roman Empire (Solomon's nods appear in Florence in the mosaics of the building underneath the baptistery) and the juxtaposition of different panels is found in many other examples in the Adriatic area.\n\nFrom the dates that exist on the valuation of the found materials, a hypothesis can be formulated to date the mosaic between the fourth and the sixth century. It is still necessary to verify this hypothesis with a valuation of the historic point in time. There is the erroneous, rather diffuse opinion that Florence was entering a period of great decadence at the end of the fourth century, so much so that building activity could not be kept up to construct Santa Reparata or the baptistery. According to this erroneous opinion both could not have been built before the 6th or 7th century. The baptistery was considered to be of the Lombard age because it was dedicated to the baptist. However, the existence of such decadence has been disputed, because in 366 Florence was the capital of a vast province and united Tuscany and Umbria, due to the administrative reform by Diocletian and, until 315, it has been the seat of a bishop.\n\nThe city was anyway of primary importance and the central power certainly did not neglect it, also because its strategic position at a point where the Via Cassia crossed the river Arno winding its way to Rome. Lognes Pegna said that because during about half of the fourth century the rich people of Florence preferred to abandon Florence to defend themselves from an overly greedy fiscal authority and to evade taxes from administrative officers who took on personal responsibility to collect taxes, the rich landowners abandoned their houses and retired to the country. These town houses then ended as ruins. \n\nVillas like the one found underneath the baptistery, according to Lopes Pegna, were probably occupied by plebeians, small craftsmen or by merchants. Also, this very building, at the time of the attack of the Ostrogoths, was protected by the \"Porta ad aquilonem\", and must have been in a position especially exposed to various attacks and devastations by the barbarians, who threw themselves against the north gate in August 405 or 406. In this respect, Busignani objects that it cannot be understood why the attack of the Ostrogoths should have been concentrated in this point at the north gate.\n\nIt is known that the troops of the Ostrogoths were split up into three parts, of which two were camping on the hills of Fiesole while the third wing attacked Florence besieging it from every side. \n\nWith respect to the Roman walls at the north side, from the excavations of 1971 to 1972 it has been cleared up that the area of the wall that lies between the \"Porta da aquilonem\" and the area of Santa Maria del Fiore was already down in the imperial age. This discovery explains that the city had to be fortified further, which was done in the second half of the fourth century when the barbaric attackers began to really frighten Florence. This must have been the situation of the city when Ambrose, bishop of Milan, came to Florence in 393 and founded the basilica of San Lorenzo, outside the city gate \"ad aquilonem\", but still protected in a certain way.\n\nThe victory over Radagaisus must have given Florence a new vital impulse and Christianisation was spurred when Ambrose announced the victory over the barbarians. All that needs to be kept in mind when in the years following the victory there was a new zeal in the construction of religious buildings. According to Busignani, the new grand basilica and the baptistery in front of it must have been constructed in a united effort within a programme of a range that required efficient structures within the city. \n\nThe truce lasted about a century and a half, until the Greek-gothic war (according to Davidsohn volume 1, p. 81). The buildings of the city did not suffer damage in this new war, when the armed encounter took place in Mugello, next to Scarperia.\n\nIt is certain that from the middle of the above-mentioned century on, between the years of Stilicho and Radagaisus and the years of Justinian and Totila, there was a progressive and important impoverishment of the population of Florence, as well as in all Italy. This impoverishment, that started after the fall from power of Radagaisus, confirmed the premature dating of the basilica and the baptistery. According to Busignani the baptistery is so atypical in its architectural structure that it could not be explained if not in tight closeness to classical Roman architecture, and because the basilica had to be, according to logic, earlier than the construction of the baptismal church, a dating according to the victory of 405 - 406 became necessary.\n\nThe Gothic Wars finished in 554. This long war period reduced Florence to a miserable state. Under the Lombards Florence lost its supremacy over Tuscia in favour of Lucca, while the historic enemy Fiesole also took power. Tradition wants it that Florence was restored by Charlemagne, even if it is more correct to talk of a rebirth (in fact it was celebrated as such at the time). And now it is logical enough to locate the first rebuilding of Santa Reparata in this age of rebirth.\n\nThe excavations have cast light on a new basilica above the antique paleo-Christian church with characteristiques that are very diverse, even though the walls on the perimeter were still the same (or better, they were in part reconstructed on top of the antique ones). So the structural organism changed as described below.\n\nAfter the structural changes during the Carolingian time (8th to 9th century), the new Santa Reparata represented an episode of new type in architecture, because it articulates structures that changes the undefined space of paleo-Christian churches (see textbox). It possessed a structure similar to a crossing nave.\nAs far as the use of the crypt goes, that was realized in this basilica at this time, It came into existence and spread during the Carolingian age, tied to a cult of martyrs and saints that frequently were excavated at the time and placed inside the church: almost all scientists believe that the bones of St. Zanobus have been transferred at this time.\n\nTogether with the bones of St. Zanobus the chair of the bishop was probably moved from San Lorenzo to Santa Reparata. It is impossible to know if the transfer was at the time of bishop Andrew (869 to 890), as some claim. It is documented that Andrew dedicated the altar in Santa Reparata, which would confirm the Carolingian chronology of the second rebuilding of the basilica. Andrew was an important personality for the Florentine rebirth under the successors of Charlemagne, given that in 871 he was an envoy of Louis II (Davidsohn volume 1 p. 131) and as such sat in judgement together with margrave of Tuscia, Adalbert, four years later, in 875; he obtained immunity for the territory of his own diocese from the emperor Charles the Bald; and in the year 876 he was in Pavia among the 18 bishops that elected the same Charles II the Bald King of Italy.\n\nProbably, in the 9th century, after the reconstruction (or possibly, but according to Busigani less probable, in the 10th century) there were two towers or campanili at the side of the apsis of Santa Reparata; of these the excavations have found the massive foundations. It is likely that the towers had defensive functions, because in the 10th century there were frequent invasions on behalf of the Magyars into Tuscany. In Northern Italy, the use of the two towers at the flanks of the apsis is only found at the end of the 10th century; in France, Switzerland and Germany it is documented until the first quarter of the 11th century and these are the examples the constructors drew from.\n\nOn 4 June 1055 pope Victor II opened the first council of Florence, where 120 bishops and the emperor Henry III were united, opened in Santa Reparata. Gerard de Bourgogne (deceased in 1061) had been the bishop of Florence for 10 years, and became pope under the name of Niklas II without leaving his chair in Florence. The city underwent several sudden changes in status in the second half of the 6th decade of the 9th century: Florence went from \"città della marca\" (a provincial center) to \"città dell'impero\" (\"imperial city\") and then back again to \"città della marca\" (Volume 1, Davidsohn p. 231).\nIt seems that in view of the council of 1055, several activities were carried out: widening of the crypt, adding of two apside at the sides of the major apsis, construction of an arcade, of which the foundations were found – the foundations of eight pilasters or columns, at about 13 metres outside the facade of Santa Maria del Fiore. In any case, although it is documented that Pope Nicholas II, who was present in his Florentine diocese from November 1059, consecrated the churches that were reconstructed to Santa Felicita and from San Lorenzo, we have no document relating to the consecration of Santa Reparata by the pope or bishop. But as far as the baptistery is concerned, there is an inscription on a panel from the 17th or 18th century, on which it is reported to be consecrated to San Giovanni on 6 November 1055. However, if the additions were made before the council, it seems likely that Nicholas II had consecrated Santa Reparata when he was still bishop. The apses are from the romanesque age because the way they are constructed in respect to the foundations of the two towers, especially the southern one, makes it likely that these were brought down at this occasion. The crypt also was enlarged in the romanesque age; the ceiling was carried by columns and its dimensions were widened until the entry of the two chapels on the side, where two stairways lead up to the presbytery.\n\nAs far as the arcade is concerned, little is known about it from the finding of the foundations of the columns. Still, with the added arcade, the space between the Baptistery and Santa Reparata is reduced to about 17 or 18 metres. The two columns of porphyry were originally placed at six metres distance from the eastern gate in memory of the occupation of the Balearic Islands in 1115 and stayed there until 1333.\n\nIt is likely that the facade of Santa Reparata was decorated with polychromous marble just like the baptistery. But, as Villani says, Santa Reparata at a certain point had to seem rough and too small for the new ambitions of Florence in the 13th century, so much so that in 1293 it was decided to reconstruct the building.\n\nOn 8 September 1296 the cornerstone was laid for the new cathedral, but the people of Florence continued to honor Santa Reparata so much so that in the middle of the 13th century the little apsis on the right side was equipped with a fresco with a pietà. At the time, the antique works at the level of 1.05 metres above the Roman groundlevel were covered by 85 cm of earth, on top of which the cobblestone pavement was laid at 1.90 metres above Roman ground level; 80 cm above is the marble pavement of Santa Maria del Fiore.\n"}

Wally and the other beach entertainers, the Sandman (John Le Mesurier) who makes sand sculptures, and Neville the photographer (Mario Fabrizi) are socially unacceptable to the town's snobbish elite.\n\nWally's wife, Delia (Sylvia Syms), runs a typical seaside curios shop of the time below their flat, and is socially ambitious. To achieve this she needs to have Wally invited to entertain at the official reception for Lady Jane Caterham (Barbara Murray), who is to switch on the town's illuminations, and at the mayoress's suggestion the reception committee invites Wally to entertain.\n\nThe illumination ceremony ends in farce when Wally's electric shaver shorts out some of the lights, causing some of the illuminated signs to display unflattering comments about the town. The dinner degenerates into a food fight when one of the drunken guests heckles Punch, and when Lady Jane rounds on Wally, Delia floors her with a punch. Her dreams of social acceptance have vanished, but Wally and Delia retire, wiser and closer.\n\n\nThe town of Piltdown is apparently named after Piltdown Man.\n\nThe film is a gentle but bitter-sweet comedy, and provides some considerable insight into Hancock himself. The screenplay by Hancock and Philip Oakes appears to be based partly on Hancock's own life and first marriage. In an early scene, Wally and Delia have breakfast in almost total silence, and the scene demonstrates that they are married from habit, and no longer have anything in common. The scene is often considered to be an observation on Hancock's marriage to the former Cicely Romanis.\n\nIn the following scene, Wally angrily rams a bunch of flowers up a porcelain pig's backside. The flowers were first intended to go up the pig's nose, but Hancock argued that the joke had to be stronger and so a prop with a suitable orifice was made. Delia later discovers the flower-abused pig in a socially awkward situation. The beginning of this scene was cut from the DVD, and from many television versions (though a still survives), leaving only the moment when Delia finds the flowers.\n\nIn another scene, Wally retreats from the rain into an ice cream parlour with a small boy, played by Sylvia Syms' nephew, Nicholas Webb. The boy asks for a large sundae (a \"Piltdown Glory\") and Wally orders the same. Then, because he is uncertain of the correct etiquette for eating the dessert, Wally carefully watches the boy and imitates his every move. The scene was completed from several different takes, between which Hancock would wash away the taste of the ice cream with vodka as he much disliked the taste of the dessert. The scene was originally supposed to be done in a shorter time frame, but Hancock believed that drawing it out as long as it did would work better, and ultimately hold more impact and humour for the viewers.\n\nSeveral actors from Hancock's earlier television series, \"Hancock's Half Hour\", also appear in supporting roles: John Le Mesurier, Hugh Lloyd, Mario Fabrizi and (briefly) Hattie Jacques. Syms was cast as Delia after Billie Whitelaw withdrew. Roger Wilmut, in \"Tony Hancock: Artiste\" (1978), argues that the climactic food fight escalates too quickly and that a more experienced director would have been given it more time to develop comedically.\n\nThe film itself was partly shot on location in Bognor Regis, and when the producers asked for some local people to take parts as extras, over 2,000 people turned up. Many parts of the town are immortalised in the film; the pier and the town hall feature alongside other areas such as Spencer Street, Belmont Street, and York Road, beside the Esplanade and Royal Hotel, where in fact the film crew stayed. Tony Hancock himself stayed at the more expensive and smarter Royal Norfolk Hotel during filming.\n"}

It is particularly noted as the venue for numerous land speed records. The Bonneville Salt Flats Race Track is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe salt flats were first used for motor sports in 1912, but did not become truly popular until the 1930s when Ab Jenkins and Sir Malcolm Campbell competed to set land speed records.\n\nA reduction of available racing surface and salt thickness has led to the cancellation of events at Bonneville, such as Speed Week in 2014 and 2015.\nAvailable racing surface is much reduced with just available instead of the courses traditionally used for Speed Week.\n\nHistorically, the speedway was marked out by the Utah Department of Transportation at the start of each summer. Originally, two tracks were prepared; a long straightaway for speed trials and an oval or circular track for distance runs, which was typically between long depending on the condition of the salt surface.\n\nSince at least the 1990s, track preparations have been the responsibility of the event organizers. Days or weeks in advance, the track preparers identify an area best suited for their track layouts and begin grading the tracks. Surveyors are brought in to survey the timing trap distances. A day before racing begins, the track markers are added.\n\nOriginally, the straightaway was marked with a broad black line down its center. This was eventually changed to lines down either side, as the center line wore out too quickly. As the costs for painting the lines has gone up, organizations have switched to flags and cones as track markers. The last event to use black lines was Speed Week, August 2009.\n\nThe number of tracks and the timed sections for each track are set according to what is most beneficial for each event. Large public meets such as Speed Week run as many as four tracks with several timed miles, usually starting with the second mile and running to the fifth mile. Smaller meets that typically only run world record attempts will utilize a single track, with one timed mile and one timed kilometer in the middle of the track. Additional marks and cones indicate the end of the track and the position of timing equipment.\n\nThe annual Speed Week was cancelled in both 2014 and 2015, as were many land-speed racing events, due to deteriorating track conditions. Heavy rains caused a layer of mud from surrounding mountains to flow onto the flats, covering approximately of the track. Although another section of the flats would normally be used, nearby salt mining operations had reduced the size of the alternative track.\n\nThe depth of the salt crust at Bonneville has also been decreasing, possibly leaching into a saltwater aquifer. Measured at as much at in the 1940s and 50s, it has been reduced to just in 2015.\n\nThough recent studies have been made (since 1960), the causes of this deterioration are not clear, although the evidence points toward both local climatic changes and salt mining. Some strategies were devised to revert the decreasing salt surface, such as pumping back salt, though this had no effect.\n\nIn August, the Southern California Timing Association and Bonneville Nationals Inc. organize Speed Week, the largest meet of the year, which attracts several hundred drivers who compete to set highest speed in a range of categories.\n\nIn late August, the Bonneville Motorcycle Speed Trials are held.\n\nIn September each year is the World of Speed, (similar to Speed Week) organized by the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association. The USFRA also meet on the first Wednesday of each month throughout the summer.\n\nIn October, the Southern California Timing Association puts on World Finals, a scaled-down version of Speed Week.\n\nEach year, there are usually a few private meets that are not publicized scattered among the larger public meets.\n\nNumerous land speed records in various vehicle categories and classes have been set on the Bonneville speed way. In 1960, Mickey Thompson became the first American to break the barrier, hitting and surpassing John Cobb's 1947 one-way Land speed record of . Other notable examples of Bonneville speed records include:\n\nSeveral motor-paced racing speed records have been attempted at Bonneville.\n\nIn 1985, British cyclist John Howard set a then world record of .\n\nOn 15 October 1995, Dutch cyclist Fred Rompelberg achieved , using a special bicycle behind a dragster with a large shield.\n\nIn 2016, Denise Mueller-Korenek claimed a women's bicycle land speed record at . She was coached by Howard. It is not clear which authority was supervising the record attempt.\n\nIn 2018, Mueller-Korenek broke her own women's record and the men's record at a speed of .\n\nIn the series finale episode of \"Mad Men\", Donald Draper drives a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS muscle car in the races at Bonneville Speedway.\nIn the film The World's Fastest Indian Burt Munro and his highly modified Indian Scout motorcycle sets a world record.\n\n\n\n"}

The site is operated by Dominion Generation company and is jointly owned by the Dominion Virginia Power corporation (88.4%) and by the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (11.6%).\n\nThe plant has two Westinghouse pressurized water reactors which went on-line in 1978 and 1980 respectively. Together the reactors generate 1.79 gigawatts of power, which is distributed mainly to the greater Richmond area and to Northern Virginia. In March 2003, the NRC approved 20 year license extensions for both Units 1 & 2.\n\nAn artificial lake, Lake Anna, was constructed on the North Anna River to provide a reservoir of water coolant for use with the nuclear plant.\n\nDominion currently owns nuclear power plants in Virginia (North Anna, Surry), Connecticut (Millstone), and Wisconsin (Kewaunee). North Anna is similar in design and appearance to Surry Power Station.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of North Anna was 21,396, an increase of 15.7 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,912,015, an increase of 22.6 percent since 2000. Cities within include Richmond ( to city center).\n\nDevelopment of North Anna Unit 3 was placed on hold after Dominion obtained regulatory permission from the NRC to build and operate an additional unit at the site in 2017. \n\nDominion Nuclear North Anna, LLC submitted its application for an Early Site Permit (ESP) for the North Anna site on September 25, 2003. The NRC issued the ESP on November 27, 2007. On the same day, Dominion submitted an application for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) for a 1,520 MWe GE–Hitachi Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR), designated as North Anna Unit 3.\n\nIn 2009, having failed to agree on terms for an engineering construction and procurement deal with GE-Hitachi to actually build the reactor, Dominion issued a new request for proposals from reactor vendors. In 2010, Dominion announced that it had selected a 1,700 MWe, US-specific version of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' (MHI) Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (APWR) for the potential Unit 3. The proposed reactor brought public protest. On August 7, 2008 six activists from the Peoples Alliance for Clean Energy were arrested at the North Anna Information Center for trespassing.\n\nOn Oct 29, 2010 Dominion president Tom Farrell told investors that Dominion had decided to slow its development of the proposed third reactor and wait until the combined construction permit-operating license (COL) was approved by the NRC before deciding to complete the project. This approval was expected in early 2013 but issued in May 2017.\nIn 2013, it was announced that the ESBWR design would be pursued after all. Dominion stated that it would amend its COL application to reflect the ESBWR technology by the end of 2013 and expected to receive the COL \"no earlier than late 2015.\" Dominion noted that it had not yet committed to building a new unit at North Anna. \nIn October 2015, the Virginia Attorney-General's Office called for the abandonment of the project because of the cost burden on consumers .\n\nOn January 19, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that its staff had completed its Final Safety Evaluation Report for a Combined License for the proposed reactor. The report concluded there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the license for construction and operation of the new reactor. On May 31, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had authorized the issuance of a Combined License for North Anna. The license granted permission to build and operate an ESBWR design at the site. The license contained conditions, including specific actions associated with the NRC's post-Fukushima requirements for Mitigation Strategies and Spent Fuel Pool Instrumentation, and a pre-startup schedule for post-Fukushima aspects of the new reactor's emergency preparedness plans and procedures. On September 6, 2017, Dominion Energy paused development activities related to North Anna Unit 3, a decision which nuclear consultant Jim Little suggests may have been due to market conditions and competition from natural gas. Since the federal construction and operating license is valid for 20 years, Dominion Energy may opt to resume the project if economic prospects for the plant improve within that period., \n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at North Anna was 1 in 22,727, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nAccording to the USGS, two distinct seismic zones are located in Virginia. The Central Virginia Seismic Zone and the Giles County Seismic Zone. Both of these zones produce recurrent small earthquakes at least every few years. The North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, located 40 miles north west of Richmond, lies within the Central Virginia Seismic Zone.\n\nDuring the construction of original nuclear reactors at North Anna, the utility learned of the existence of fault lines within the construction site of the proposed plants from its outside independent engineering firm, Stone & Webster, who had been hired by the utility to assess the proposed nuclear plant locations. The utility was fined $32,000.00 by the government for concealing this information.\n\nAccording to the \"Huffington Post\", this 1977 Justice Department memo \"..focused on how the power company and federal regulatory officials went to efforts to not make public the knowledge of geologic faulting at North Anna. \"[V]irtually the entire Office of Regulation of the [Nuclear Regulator Commission was] ...well aware of the fault and determined not to take any immediate action,\" according to the memo. A government attorney, Bradford Whitman, did not recommend prosecution at the time, but the power company was eventually fined $32,500 for making false statements during the licensing process, according to the DOJ memo.\"\n\nAt 1:51pm on August 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake occurred, centered south of Mineral, Virginia, eleven miles from the North Anna Nuclear Station. The Associated Press reported the quake \"was felt as far north as Rhode Island, New York City and Martha's Vineyard, Mass.\" The reactors automatically shut down and, because of a loss of offsite power, four diesel generators started up to supply electricity to safety systems. The plant reported an \"Alert\" status, the second lowest level of four NRC emergency classifications, until 11:16am on August 24, 2011. One of the generators suffered a coolant leak and stopped working. A fifth standby generator was activated to replace the broken unit, which was repaired. Offsite power was restored later on August 23. Dominion also reported that the aftershocks did not affect the power plant. Also on August 24, Dominion announced that it had ended the \"Notice of Unusual Event\", the least serious of the NRC emergency classifications, at the North Anna Power Station following inspection of equipment susceptible to seismic activity.\n\nAfter the Fukushima disaster had occurred six months prior, the Virginia earthquake prompted public fears of a similar nuclear accident at North Anna. According to local Virginia media station, WHSV, \"The two North Anna reactors are among 27 in the eastern and central U.S. that may need upgrades because those plants are more likely to get hit with an earthquake larger than the one on which their design was based, according to a preliminary Nuclear Regulatory Commission review.\" The Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended the operating licenses of these plants for an additional 20 years back in 2003. Dominion has publicly stated that on-site, spent-nuclear-fuel long-term storage canisters shifted during the earthquake along with various building cracks, all while maintaining such damage does not represent unsafe operating conditions.\n\nAfter more than two months of inspections NRC permitted restart in November 2011. As of December 20, 2011, both units at North Anna Power Station have restarted, and are operating at full power.\n\nOn-site groundwater was found to contain high level of tritium, the source of the tritium leak was unknown\n\nSome fuel oil was believed to be released underground, the source of leakage was unknown.\n\nThe North Anna Nuclear Generating Station consists of two operational reactors, two originally planned units were cancelled. One additional unit is planned.\n"}

The Folsom point was identified as a unique style of projectile point in 1926.\n\nThe points are bifacially worked and have a symmetrical, leaf-like shape with a concave base and wide, shallow grooves running almost the entire length of the point. The edges are finely worked. The characteristic groove, known as fluting, may have served to aid hafting to a wooden shaft or dart. Use-wear studies have shown that some examples were used as knives as well as projectile points. The fluting required great technical ability to effect, and it took archaeologists many years of experimentation to replicate it. This point is thought to be the pinnacle of the fluting technology. The flute was made by creating a nipple platform at the center of the base.  The remnants of the nipple may be present on completed examples.\n\nFolsom points are found widely across North America and are dated to the period between 9500 BCE and 8000 BCE.

The facility is owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).\n\nThe plant has two Westinghouse pressurized water reactors. Sequoyah units 1 & 2, as well as their sister plant at Watts Bar, both have ice condenser containment systems. In case of a large loss-of-coolant accident, steam generated by the leak is directed toward borated ice which helps condense the steam creating a lower pressure, allowing for a smaller containment building.\n\nSequoyah's two units have a winter net dependable capacity of 2,440 megawatts, making Sequoyah the most productive of TVA's three nuclear plants. Sequoyah is the second-most powerful power plant in Tennessee, second only to the Cumberland Fossil Plant northwest of Nashville, but actually generates more power. Following the restart of Brown's Ferry Unit 1, that plant again became most productive at 3,440 MW.\n\nTVA constructed dry cask storage facilities at Sequoyah and purchased special storage containers for the purpose of storing spent nuclear fuel. The storage facilities have been approved by the NRC.\n\nConstruction began on Sequoyah on May 27, 1970. Unit 1 was licensed by the NRC on September 17, 1980, and commercial operation began on July 1, 1981. Unit 2 was licensed on September 15, 1981 and began operation on June 1, 1982. Sequoyah was the first new nuclear plant licensed after the Three Mile Island accident.\n\nOn August 22, 1985, Sequoyah was shut down due to safety concerns. An independent contractor hired to analyze the safety systems of the plant had found that TVA lacked documentation proving that all of the plant's safety systems would function properly in the event of an emergency. Brown's Ferry, TVA's only other operating nuclear plant at the time, had been shut down in March 1985, due to safety concerns about a fire ten years earlier, and during this time, TVA was without nuclear power completely.\nOn March 22, 1988, TVA was authorized by the NRC to restart both Sequoyah units. Both reactors returned to service later that year.\n\nThe operating license of Sequoyah's Unit 1 was originally set to expire in 2020, and Unit 2's operating license in 2021. In 2015, the NRC renewed the operating license for both units for an additional 20 years.\n\nTVA's Sequoyah operating license was modified in September 2002 to allow TVA to irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods at Sequoyah for the U.S. Department of Energy. The process of irradiating tritium-producing rods produces tritium, which is used in nuclear weapons and for various forms of research into nuclear fusion for commercial power production. TVA began irradiating tritium-producing rods at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in 2003. As of February 2007, TVA had no plans to produce tritium at Sequoyah.\n\nSequoyah was Cherokee, part of the Overhill Cherokee, reportedly born in Tuskegee, a town at the confluence of the Tellico River and Little Tennessee River, upriver of the nuclear power plant. He is known for creating the Cherokee syllabary circa 1820. Many Cherokee sites were flooded during the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) construction of Tellico Dam (1967-1979). Naming the site after a local Native American Indian was considered a small political token to the Cherokee in compensation for the dam-flooding and destruction of their historic sites that TVA required to control flooding on the Tennessee River.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone of radius (concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination), and an ingestion pathway zone of about radius (concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity).\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Sequoyah was 99,664, according to 2010 U.S. Census data analyzed for msnbc.com, an increase of 13.8 percent in a decade. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,079,868 (increase of 13.8 percent). Cities within 50 miles include Chattanooga (14 miles to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Sequoyah was 1 in 19,608, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\n"}

This game was notable in that the Oilers starting quarterback was Ken Stabler, who had spent 10 years as Oakland's quarterback before he was traded to Houston prior to this season. Houston's offense also featured future hall of fame tight end Dave Casper, who had played for Oakland since 1974 until he was traded to the Oilers in Week 6.\n\nHouston running back Earl Campbell lost a fumble on the first play of the game, which was recovered by Oakland safety Mike Davis, setting up Oakland kicker Chris Bahr's 47-yard field goal.

With about six minutes left in the game, Hayes returned an interception 20 yards to the end zone to clinch the Raiders' victory. This would the last playoff game Oakland would host until 2000.\n\nStabler threw for 243 yards, but was intercepted twice and sacked seven times. Campbell rushed for 91 yards and a score. Hayes had two interceptions, three pass deflections, and two sacks.\n\nAfter the game, Oilers linebacker Thomas Henderson was so upset he threw several pieces of his equipment into the stands, including his shoes. \"If I wouldn't have been arrested for indecent exposure, I would have thrown them my jock strap\", he said later.\n\nThe Cowboys avenged a 38–14 loss to the Rams two weeks earlier (in a game they trailed 38–0) as Dallas running back Tony Dorsett rushed for 160 yards, caught three passes for 28 yards, and scored two touchdowns to lead his team to victory.\n\nA 14-yard punt return by Dallas running back James Jones set up kicker Rafael Septién's 28-yard field goal to give the Cowboys a 3-0 lead. The Rams responded by driving 73 yards to score on running back Jewerl Thomas' 1-yard run. However, the ensuing extra point was blocked and Septien later made a 29-yard field goal to tie the game at 6.\n\nIn the second quarter, Los Angeles drove 80 yards in six plays to score on Vince Ferragamo's 21-yard touchdown pass to receiver Preston Dennard, who finished the game with six receptions for 117 yards, but the Cowboys tied the game before halftime by moving the ball 71 yards on a drive that ended with Dorsett's 12-yard rushing touchdown.\n\nAfter the game was tied at halftime, 13–13, Dallas coach Tom Landry went to a 5-man defensive front and they dropped various combinations into seven and eight man coverage to confuse the Rams potent passing game. The result was a combination of pressure on Ferragamo, who completed just five of 13 second half passes for 49 yards and was intercepted three times.\n\nDanny White threw touchdown passes on Dallas' first three drives of the second half. His 37-yard completion to tight end Jay Saldi set up a score on a 10-yard pass to Dorsett, who caught the ball at the 7 and dragged Rams defenders Johnnie Johnson and Rod Perry all the way into the end zone. Then Cowboys defensive back Aaron Mitchell picked off a pass from Ferragamo and returned it 12 yards, setting off a 70-yard Dallas drive that ended with White's 35-yard touchdown completion to Butch Johnson. Now with a comfortable lead, Dallas put the game away early in the fourth quarter, driving 95 yards, including a 23-yard burst by Dorsett, to go up 34-13 on White's 11-yard touchdown pass to Drew Pearson.\n\nDallas then turned to a potent rushing attack to chew up time and keep the Rams offense off the field. By the end of the game, Dallas rushed 46 times for a franchise playoff record 338 yards, while also setting a franchise record for total yards with 528 and holding the Rams to 260. Jones finished the game with three kickoff returns for 72 yards, five punt returns for 81 yards, and another 38 yards on five carries.\n\nAlthough San Diego outgained Buffalo in total yards, 397 to 244, they still found themselves trailing for most of the game. With 2:08 left in the fourth quarter, Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts threw the game-winning 50-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ron Smith to defeat the Bills, 20–14. This was San Diego's first postseason win since 1963 (in the AFL) and their first playoff win as an NFL team.\n\nSan Diego scored first with a 22-yard field goal by Rolf Benirschke on their opening drive. But the Bills stormed back with two unanswered touchdowns. First they responded to the field goal by driving 72 yards, aided by a 37-yard pass interference penalty on linebacker Ray Preston, to score on Roosevelt Leaks' 1-yard touchdown run. Late in the second quarter, Bills defensive back Charles Romes forced a fumble from Charlie Joiner that defensive back Bill Simpson recovered for Buffalo on the Chargers 33-yard line. The Bills then drove to a 14-3 lead in four plays, as Joe Ferguson completed an 18-yard pass to Frank Lewis and then found him in the end zone for a 9-yard score.\n\nHowever, San Diego took the second half kickoff and quickly racked up yardage with an 18-yard run by Chuck Muncie and a 45-yard completion from Fouts to Joiner. Fouts eventually finished the 70-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Joiner, making the score 14-10. Then late in the third quarter, the Chargers forced the Bills to punt from their own 8-yard line and got the ball with great field position on the Buffalo 49. Fouts then led the team to the 1, but a penalty pushed them back and they ended up settling for Rolf Benirschke's 22-yard field goal to make it 14–13.\n\nBuffalo had a great chance to put the game away when Lou Piccone blocked a Chargers punt that was recovered by linebacker Ervin Parker on the San Diego 38. But safety Glen Edwards intercepted a pass from Ferguson on the San Diego 9-yard line to keep the Bills from scoring. With 6:17 left in regulation, Buffalo got another chance to get a decisive score when they recovered a fumbled punt return from Mike Fuller. But two plays later, defensive tackle Fred Dean dropped Joe Cribbs for a 1-yard loss on third and 1, and then Nick Mike-Mayer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to San Diego with 3:59 left.\n\nAfter driving to midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz for the next play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked the ball out of Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed to get one step ahead of Simpson, make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson face down on the turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by recording his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.\n\nAfter the game, it was revealed that Ferguson had been playing with a fractured ankle, suffered three weeks earlier in a game against the New England Patriots. He finished the day with 180 yards and a touchdown, but was intercepted three times. Fouts threw for 314 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His top target was receiver John Jefferson, who caught seven passes for 102 yards. Prior to this game, Ron Smith had caught only 7 passes during the season, and his 50-yard game winning score was his only catch of the game.\n\nThe Eagles forced eight turnovers, seven in the second half, en route to a 31–16 victory, while also holding the Vikings to just 215 total yards, with a mere 36 on the ground. It marked a bitter repeat for Minnesota, who had lost to the Eagles 42-7 during the regular season.\n\nThe Vikings scored 14 unanswered points in the first half, starting with wide receiver Sammy White's 30-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Tommy Kramer. Then after a punt, they drove 69 yards in 10 plays to score on running back Ted Brown's 1-yard touchdown run. However, Philadelphia scored before halftime by finishing off an 85-yard drive with quarterback Ron Jaworski's 9-yard touchdown completion to wide receiver Harold Carmichael. The Eagles then tied the game on the opening possession of the second half with Wilbert Montgomery's 8-yard touchdown run.\n\nThen the wave of turnovers began (11 total between both teams). First, Kramer threw a pass that was intercepted by Roynell Young on the Eagles 7-yard line. Minnesota then scored a safety when Jaworski was sacked in the end zone by Matt Blair and Doug Martin, but Reggie Wilkes recovered a fumbled punt return by Vikings running back Eddie Payton on the Minnesota 18 that set up Montgomery's 5-yard touchdown run, putting the Eagles up 21-16. With 16 seconds left in the third quarter, Eagles lineman Carl Hairston forced a recovered a fumble from Kramer on the Vikings 44-yard line. But this opportunity was wasted as Montgomery fumbled the ball back to Minnesota on the next play.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Eagles lineman Ken Clarke recovered a fumble from Doug Paschal, which was soon countered by Jaworski's interception to defensive back John Turner. A few plays later, Herm Edwards intercepted a pass from Kramer, only to see this later nullified by Jaworski's interception to defensive back Tom Hannon. With 9:16 left in regulation, Eagles linebacker Frank LeMaster returned an interception from Kramer seven yards to the Vikings 15, leading to Tony Franklin's 33-yard field goal to increase the Eagles lead to 24-16. Then on the Vikings next drive, Edwards intercepted another pass and returned it 14 yards to the Minnesota 31, leading to Perry Harrington's 1-yard rushing touchdown to make the final score 31-16. On the last play of the game, Young intercepted a pass from Kramer in the end zone.\n\nIn a play that has become known as Red Right 88, Browns quarterback Brian Sipe's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Raiders safety Mike Davis with 41 seconds left in the game to preserve Oakland's 14–12 victory. Instead of opting for a game-winning field goal, Cleveland decided to attempt a passing play because Browns kicker Don Cockroft had previously missed two of four field goal attempts, had another aborted following a bad snap, and had one extra point blocked. In addition, the field was frozen and slippery.\n\nWith the game-time temperature at , the coldest NFL game since the Ice Bowl of December 31, 1967, the first quarter contained nothing but punts and interceptions, with Cleveland's Ron Bolton and Oakland's Lester Hayes each recording a pick. Near the end of the quarter, Sipe's 20-yard completion to Reggie Rucker sparked a drive inside the Raiders 30-yard line, but it ended with no points early in the second quarter when Cockroft missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. On Oakland's ensuing drive, quarterback Jim Plunkett lost a fumble while being sacked, but their defense kept the Browns in check and Cockroft missed another field goal try, this one from 30 yards out.\n\nFinally with 6:02 left in the second quarter, Bolton scored the first points of the day by recording his second interception from Plunkett and returning it 42 yards to the end zone. However, Cockroft's ensuing extra point was blocked by Ted Hendricks. After an exchange of punts, Oakland managed to get on the board, with Plunkett completing passes to Bob Chandler and Raymond Chester for gains of 15 and 26 yards on a 64-yard scoring drive. Mark van Eeghen finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds left in the half, making the score 7–6.\n\nOn Cleveland's opening drive of the second half, a 28-yard kickoff return to the 40-yard line by Charles White started off a 48-yard drive that ended with Cockroft's 30-yard field goal, retaking the lead for the Browns at 9–7. Then after forcing a punt, Cleveland drove to the Raiders 24-yard line, but on a field goal attempt, holder Paul McDonald was unable to handle a bad snap and was downed for an 11-yard loss. Starting out their next drive on the Raiders 44 after a punt, Cleveland drove to the 9, featuring a 21-yard reception by Dave Logan to score on another 30-yard field goal from Cockroft, making the score 12–7 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nEarly in the final quarter, the Raiders took a 14–12 lead at the end of an 80-yard drive highlighted by Chester's 27-yard catch. On the last play, van Eeghen scored his second 1-yard touchdown run of the day. Later on, the Raiders had a chance to put the game away when they recovered a fumble from Sipe on the Browns 24-yard line with 4:19 left in the game. But after moving to a third and 1 situation on the 15, van Eeghen was stuffed for no gain on two consecutive plays. On the second play after the turnover, Sipe completed a 29-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and later a 23-yarder to Greg Pruitt. Then Mike Pruitt ran the ball 14 yards to the Raiders 14-yard line. Pruitt gained another yard on the next play, and the team called a timeout from the 13 with 49 seconds left.\n\nBrowns coach Sam Rutigliano called for a pass play, Red Right 88, instructing Sipe that if no one was open \"throw it to the blond in the first row\". His intention was to give the team one last chance to score a touchdown before running the ball on third down to set up a Cockroft field goal. But on the pass play, Sipe was picked off by Davis while trying to connect with Newsome in the back of the end zone, allowing the Raiders to escape with a win.\n\nThe quarterbacks of both teams were completely dominated throughout the game. Sipe completed just 13 of 40 passes for 183 yards and intercepted three times, while Plunkett completed only 14 of 30 passes for 149 yards, with two interceptions. Hayes and Bolton each had two interceptions.\n\nThe Cowboys scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to come from behind and defeat the Falcons 30–27. Atlanta jumped to a 10–3 lead, aided by quarterback Steve Bartkowski's 60-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Alfred Jenkins. In the second quarter, Dallas recovered a fumble in Atlanta territory and tied the game on quarterback Danny White's 5-yard touchdown completion to tight end Billy Joe DuPree. However, the Falcons responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynn Cain to take a 17–10 lead. Then after forcing a punt, Atlanta mounted another drive into Dallas territory, but defensive back Steve Wilson intercepted a pass from Bartkowski and the score remained 17–10 at halftime.\n\nDallas started out the second half with a drive to midfield, but lost the ball on a play that initially appeared to go in their favor. Running back Preston Pearson caught a short pass from White and took off for a big gain, but linebacker Joel Williams, who initially pressured White into making the pass, managed to chase Pearson down and force a fumble on the 15-yard line. After recovering the fumble, Atlanta stormed down the field and increased their lead to 24–10 with Bartkowski's 12-yard touchdown pass to running back William Andrews.\n\nStarting a drive with 3:38 left in the third quarter, Dallas mounted an 85-yard drive that ended with Robert Newhouse's 1-yard touchdown run with 13:50 left in the game. Dallas subsequently forced a punt, but Atlanta safety Tom Pridemore intercepted a pass from White and returned it 22 yards to the Cowboys 37-yard line, setting up a 34-yard field goal from Tim Mazzetti to increase the lead to 27–17. Dallas then marched 62 yards to score on Drew Pearson's 14-yard touchdown reception with 3:04 left in the game. Then two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Dallas lineman Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones appeared to jump offsides, which would have given the Falcons a first down, but managed to maintain his footing and avoid crossing the line of scrimmage before the snap. As a result, his sudden movement threw off Atlanta's offense and he ended up making a key tackle to end the drive and force a punt. Following the punt, Dallas advanced 70 yards to score on Pearson's 23-yard touchdown catch with 47 seconds left.\n\nCharlie Waters fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt, keeping the score 30–27 and giving Atlanta a chance to drive for the tying field goal. But the Falcons turned the ball over on downs before they could move it out of their own territory.\n\nJenkins finished the game with four receptions for 155 yards.\n\nThe game is featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as the Duel in Dixie.\n\nOakland built a 28–7 first half lead, but had to hold off a furious comeback attempt to become the second wild card team in NFL history to make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nIn the first quarter alone, Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed 5/6 passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for a score. On the third play of the game, Plunkett threw a pass that bounced off the hands of Kenny King and into the arms of tight end Raymond Chester, who took off to the end zone for a 65-yard touchdown reception. The Chargers seemed primed to respond, as Dan Fouts completed a 55-yard pass to Ron Smith on their first play of the next drive, but Oakland defensive back Lester Hayes, who recorded 13 interceptions in the regular season and four in the previous two playoff games, picked off a pass from Fouts and returned it 16 yards to the Raiders 25-yard line. However, the Chargers defense forced a punt and Fouts made up for his mistake on the next possession, hooking up with Charlie Joiner for a 48-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7.\n\nOakland stormed back with 21 unanswered points. First, Plunkett's 48-yard completion to receiver Cliff Branch on third down and 20 set off a 7-play, 76-yard drive that ended with his 5-yard touchdown run. Then the Raiders defense forced a punt, and Ira Matthews returned Rick Partridge's 41-yard kick 14 yards to the Chargers 49-yard line. Four plays later, Plunkett's 21-yard touchdown pass to King made the score 21–7 with 1:35 left in the first quarter. San Diego took the ball back and drove to the Raiders 21-yard line, featuring a 28-yard completion from tight end Kellen Winslow to John Jefferson on a trick play, but safety Burgess Owens ended the drive with an interception. Following a punt, San Diego running back Mike Thomas lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Ted Hendricks on the Chargers 29-yard line, and the Raiders capitalized with Plunkett's 23-yard completion to Branch leading to another touchdown, this one on a 3-yard run by Mark van Eeghen, to build a 28–7 lead. Following Hank Bauer's 27-yard kickoff return to the 36-yard line, San Diego drove 64 yards in 13 plays, including a 24-yard reception by Thomas, to score on Fouts' 8-yard touchdown completion to Joiner, cutting their deficit to 28–14 with 1:05 left in the half.\n\nThe Chargers continued to cut away at the Raiders lead in the second half, driving 68 yards in 12 plays on their opening drive. Two dropped passes by Jefferson in the end zone spoiled their chances for a touchdown, but Rolf Benirschke kicked a 26-yard field goal, making the score 28-17. Their defense then forced a punt, which Mike Fuller returned 28 yards to the Raiders 41-yard line. From there, San Diego took the ball all the way to the end zone, scoring on a 7-play drive that ended on Chuck Muncie's 6-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 28–24. Oakland responded with a 68-yard drive, including a 22-yard completion from Plunkett to King, leading to Chris Bahr's 27-yard field goal to retake their 7-point lead. Then after a three and out, Matthews returned Partridge's next punt six yards to the Oakland 49, where the Raiders added a 33-yard field goal from Bahr to increase their lead to 34–24 with 9:46 left in the game.\n\nThe Chargers then countered with a 72-yard drive ending with Benirschke's 27-yard field goal. The Raiders defense was exhausted and they implored their offense by saying \"don't let them have the damn ball back\"! The Raiders then held onto the ball for the last 6:52 of the game on a 15-play drive (12 runs, one pass, two quarterback kneels), with Plunkett scrambling twice on third down to pick up key first downs, to clinch the victory.\n\nPlunkett finished the game completing 14 of 18 passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns. Chester caught five passes for a career postseason high 102 yards and a touchdown. Fouts threw for 336 yards and two scores, but was intercepted twice. Joiner caught six passes for 130 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlthough Philadelphia quarterback Ron Jaworski completed only nine of 29 passes for 91 yards and was intercepted twice, running back Wilbert Montgomery led the Eagles to a victory by rushing for 194 yards and a touchdown. Dallas had been the highest scoring team in the NFL during the regular season, but against the Eagles defense, they could only gain 206 yards and score a single touchdown. They also fumbled five times, losing three of them.\n\nDallas was forced to a three and out on their opening drive, and the kick from quarterback Danny White (who also served as the team's punter) went just 26 yards before John Sciarra returned it to the Cowboys 42-yard line. One play later, Montgomery scored on a 42-yard rushing touchdown. The Eagles earned themselves chances to score on their next two drives. However, they were stopped both times and their special teams unit failed to capitalize. First, they drove to the Dallas 23-yard line, only to have Tony Franklin's field goal attempt blocked by Dallas cornerback Aaron Mitchell. Then they drove to the Cowboys 16-yard line, where Harvey Martin sacked Jaworski on third down and a high snap on the field goal try sailed right through Jaworski's hands.\n\nMidway through the second quarter, White, who had been held to negative passing yardage, finally got the Cowboys going on a 10-play, 68-yard drive, completing an 18-yard screen pass to Tony Dorsett and a 12-yarder to Drew Pearson before Dorsett wrapped it up with a 3-yard touchdown run to tie the game. The score would remain 7–7 at halftime, due to another blown scoring chance by the Eagles when Jaworski's touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael was canceled out by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on guard Woody Peoples.\n\nIn the third quarter, the first turnover of the game occurred when Philadelphia's Billy Campfield recovered a fumbled punt return from James Jones. Dallas quickly took the ball back with Anthony Dickerson's interception, but they only held on for a few plays before White lost a fumble due to a massive hit from Carl Hairston, which defensive end Dennis Harrison recovered on the Dallas 11-yard line to set up Franklin's 26-yard field goal. Dallas seemed to be in position to respond when tight end Jay Saldi made a leaping catch on the Eagles 40-yard line for a 28-yard gain, White's longest completion of the day. On the next play rookie cornerback Roynell Young stripped the ball from Dorsett, and linebacker Jerry Robinson returned it 22 yards to the Dallas 38-yard line. Six plays later, running back Leroy Harris scored a 9-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17–7 lead. Later on, Montgomery's 55-yard carry put the Eagles in position to put the game away, but Mitchell kept Dallas' chances alive by intercepting a pass from Jaworski in the end zone.\n\nDespite the interception, the Cowboys' offense was still unable to move the ball. For the rest of the game, the Cowboys never made it into Eagles territory, and after Philadelphia put together a 62-yard drive to score the final points of the game on Franklin's 20-yard field goal with 2:10 remaining, Young intercepted a pass from White on their final play of the game with 30 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Eagles, as the home team, elected to wear their road white jerseys instead of their home green jerseys so as to force Dallas to wear their rarely used blue jerseys rather than their familiar white jerseys; through the years, the Cowboys' blue jerseys were said to be jinxed since they often lost wearing them – especially in Super Bowl V. This would be the last game in which the Cowboys wore their royal blue jerseys; in 1981, they debuted a new navy blue uniform with a significantly different and darker shade of blue than that still used for the numbers on their white jerseys.\n\nMontgomery finished with more all-purpose yards (208) then the entire Cowboys offense. This was the first time Dallas had ever allowed an opposing player to rush for over 100 yards in team postseason history. This would be the Eagles' last playoff victory until the 1992 season. Super Bowl XV began a five-game postseason losing streak for the franchise.\n\n\n\n"}

The power station lies on an site adjacent to the James River across from Jamestown, slightly upriver from Smithfield and Newport News. Surry is operated by Dominion Generation and owned by Dominion Resources, Inc.\n\nThe Surry plant is similar in appearance and design to its \"sister plant\" North Anna Power Station, located northwest of Richmond in Louisa County, Virginia.\n\nThe plant has two triple-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors which went on-line in 1972 and 1973 respectively. Each reactor produces approximately 800 megawatts of power, for a combined plant output of 1.6 gigawatts. Surry Power Station draws its condenser cycle water directly from the James River, removing the need for the imposing cooling towers often associated with nuclear plants. Repeated testing shows that Surry Power Station has minimal environmental impact and releases virtually no radiation or harmful emissions.\n\nThe station site was originally designed for four units; however, only two reactors were built. With increasing energy demands in the United States, it is possible that more reactors will be built at Surry in the next few decades.\n\nIn 2003, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) extended the operating licenses for both reactors from forty to sixty years. In 2016 its owner announced it intended in due course to seek an extension to eighty years of operation, to 2052 and 2053.\n\nSurry was one of the plants analyzed in the NUREG-1150 safety analysis study.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Surry was 127,041, an increase of 21.9 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 2,292,642, an increase of 13.9 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Hopewell, Petersburg, Williamsburg, Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Norfolk (30 miles to city center), Virginia Beach (47 miles to city center), and Richmond (50 miles to city center).\n\n• On July 27, 1972, two workers were fatally scalded after a routine valve adjustment led to a steam release in a gap in a vent line.\n\n• On May 8, 1979, FBI agents investigated a white crystalline substance which had been poured into 62 fresh fuels elements kept in storage at the plant, a day after plant officials made the discovery. Westinghouse metallurgists found no damage to the fuel elements, including the metal containers and zirconium rods holding the fresh fuel.\n\n• On December 9, 1986, a steam explosion (condensate feed piping ruptured due to internal erosion and over-pressurization when feed pump check valve failed) in the non-nuclear part of Unit 2 injured eight workers. Four later died.\n\n• On April 16, 2011, a tornado touched down in the plant's electrical switching station, disabling primary power to the plant's cooling pumps and causing the backup diesel generators to activate without incident.\n\n• On August 23, 2011, an earthquake in central Virginia automatically shut down Dominion's North Anna reactors 11 miles from the epicenter. The similar Surry reactors continued in operation and Dominion declared a \"Notice of Unusual Event\" (the least dangerous of a four-level emergency scale) for the Surry plant which was lifted later the same day.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Surry was 1 in 175,439, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n"}

After an unlucky stay in London in 1785, where he did not win much approbation, on his getting back to Italy, he took part in Naples, very successfully, to a revival of Guglielmi’s opera \"Enea e Lavinia\", together with the already famous tenor Giacomo Davide, who shared Crescentini’s artistic inclinations. Thenceforwards, his career made more and more headway, reaching the apex in the nineties, and specially in 1796, when he created two roles which would remain in repertoire for some decades and then famous until present times, in either case by his quasi-pupil Giuseppina Grassini’s side. For him, indeed, Nicola Zingarelli wrote the part of \"Romeo\" in his opera \"Giulietta e Romeo\", staged at Milan’s La Scala on 30 January, while Domenico Cimarosa composed the role of \"Curiazio\" in \"Gli Orazi e i Curiazi\", staged instead in northern Italy’s second greater theatre, Venice’s La Fenice, on 26 December. For Zingarelli’s opera, Crescentini composed himself an aria, “\"Ombra adorata aspetta\"”, which would remain famous as “la Preghiera di Romeo” (Romeo’s Prayer), and which was a greatest enduring success for the singer and a permanent painful grievance for the composer, who referred to it as “my opera’s misfortune” because of its lack of “common sense”. After spending four years in Lisbon, starting from 1797, as the director of the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos, he got back to Italy and, after a sensational execution in Vienna of Romeo’s Prayer, out of which he was granted a crown on stage, Napoleon conferred upon him the Order of the Iron Crown of Lombardy and appointed him singing teacher of the Imperial Family. This new charge drove Crescentini to Paris from 1806 to 1812, when he finally got the leave to settle in his fatherland back again and was eventually free to retire from the stage. From 1814 he devoted himself to the teaching of singing at Bologna’s Liceo Musicale, whose direction he was entrusted in 1817, then also in Rome, and eventually at Naples’s Regio Collegio di Musica, where he had, among his pupils, Isabella Colbran and Raffaele Mirate. In 1811 he had already published a didactic essay with the title “\"Esercizi per la vocalizzazione\"”. Crescentini survived until 1846, when his artistic world was no more but a hazy faded recollection.\n\nWith Pacchiariotti, Marchesi and with the extreme offshoot of Velluti, Crescentini led castrati’s last charge: he was called, for his singing’s prodigies, the “Italian Orpheus”, and for his great, theoretical too, competence in this art, the “Nestor of the \"musici\"\". Decidedly unimposing on the stage (like Pacchiarotti), he was endowed with a clear, pliant and pure voice which won him the admiration of such personages as Alfred de Vigny, who, in his story “\"La vie e la mort du Capitaine Renaud ou La canne de jonc\"”, wrote of “\"a seraph’s voice which sprang from an emaciated and wrinkled face\"”, or as the seventeen-year-old Arthur Schopenhauer who, in his turn, entered in his diary a voice that was “\"beautiful in a supernatural way\"” and provided with a full and sweet timbre. Crescentini, who was not an exceedingly wide-ranged sopranista, always shunned the rush towards the highest notes which the C7 \"whistled\" by his contemporary \"La Bastardella\" was the living representation of, and shunned as well eagerness for immoderate singing ornamentation in all the cases where it was not actually necessary to the expression of those \"\"infinitely minute\" nuances which form the secret of Crescentini's unique perfection in his interpretation of [an] \"aria\"; furthermore all this \"infinitely minute\" material is itself in a perpetual state of transformation, constantly responding to variations in the physical condition of the singer’s voice, or to changes in intensity of the exaltation and ecstasy by which he may happen to be inspired\". Which would make any performance unfailingly different from the preceding one and from the following, too.\n\nAs the champion of the true “\"cantar che nell’anima si sente\"” Crescentini headed the revenge of the belcanto of yore on the late 18th century’s singing fashion and contributed, together with Pacchiarotti, Grassini, Luísa Todi de Agujar, the tenor Giacomo David, and few others, to lay the bases for the splendours of Rossini \"grand finale\" of two centuries’ history of operatic singing.\n\nSomething of his concept of singing, as he had expressed it in the mentioned “\"Esercizi per la vocalizzazione\"”, is likely to have passed as well in the vocal style of Bellini operas.\n\n"}
{"id": "1800989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800989", "title": "Never Too Far/Hero Medley", "text": "Never Too Far/Hero Medley\n\n\"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\" is a medley recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, first released as a charity single on December 11, 2001 through Virgin Records America and serving as the lead single for Carey's second compilation album, \"Greatest Hits\" (2001). The medley combines the first verse and chorus of \"Never Too Far\", co-written and co-produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with a re-recorded version of the first verse, chorus and bridge of \"Hero\", written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. As the latter did not receive co-production credits due to the change in instrumentation, Randy Jackson was named as producer alongside Carey instead. The single was meant to express a message of unity and love in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n\nThough Carey did not promote \"Glitter\" (2001), due to her hospitalization, she embarked on a short promotional tour for the single, and attended several charitable events. Carey performed the medley live at the 2001 Radio Music Awards, British music program \"Top of the Pops\", the concert benefit, and her own special titled, \"At Home For The Holidays With Mariah Carey\". Following the singles release, the song managed to attain a peak position of number eighty-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, in light of all of Carey's live appearances. Though promoted throughout Europe, the single was never given an official release outside the United States, therefore failing to chart in any other significant global music market.\n\nFollowing the weak commercial success of \"Glitter\" (2001), her debut release under Virgin Records, Carey suffered an emotional and physical breakdown, followed by an extended hospitalization. During this period, Carey's older label, Columbia Records, planned to release a compilation album of her biggest hits, titled \"Greatest Hits\" (2001). As they had one more album to release from Carey under her old contract, they began assembling content for its release. Though still signed to Virgin, Carey composed a charity single in which all proceeds would go towards helping rebuild America, following the terrorist attacks. Consequently, she re-recorded her 1993 song \"Hero\", and made a medley of it with a single from \"Glitter\", \"Never Too Far\". The song features a different instrumental introduction, and begins with the first verse and chorus of \"Never Too Far\", and blends into the bridge of \"Hero\". Carey had co-written \"Never Too Far\" with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and \"Hero\" with Walter Afanasieff, thus all four writers are credited for the medley. Soon-to-be \"American Idol\" judge Randy Jackson assisted Carey, Jam, and Lewis in the song's production. In an interview with MTV, Carey described the single and its conception:\n\n\"I started doing different charity events where I did a combination of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley and put them in the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.\"\nThe song's B-side, titled \"There For Me\", was a leftover track from Carey's \"Rainbow\" (1999), which she wrote alongside David Foster and Diane Warren. After Carey abandoned work with longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff, she began working with Foster throughout \"Rainbow\". During their many creative meetings, Foster introduced Carey to Warren, a songwriter with whom he had collaborated several times in the past. Throughout the process of writing and producing the song, the female pair did not work well with each other, as Carey accused Warren of repeating lyrical phrases too often, while Warren did not agree with some of Carey's production choices. After they completed the song, Carey wrote two other ballads with Warren for \"Rainbow\", entitled \"After Tonight\" and \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\".\n\n\"Never Too Far/Hero\" is a mid-tempo ballad, drawing influence from pop and R&B music genres. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Randy Jackson, and was released as the lead single from her second compilation album, \"Greatest Hits\" (2001). It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar and organ. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D to the high-note of A. The song's chorus has a basic chord progression of G–G–G/F–Em–G/D–C-G/B–Am. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey described her original feelings towards the song, prior to its release as a single:\n\nOne person could say that 'hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've considered committing suicide everyday of my life for the last ten years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, y'know?... It meant something to someone.\n\nWhile \"Hero\" describes the hidden power inside each individual, \"Never Too Far\" encourages those who are doubtful over their very existence, and how through perseverance, one can see that nothing is ever 'too far away'. Together combined, the single gives over a supportive message, for those who are either looking for meaning in life, or just doubting their own worth and ability. During a show on Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she described the meaning \"Hero\" had to her and her fans:\n\n\"I wrote a song a while back even before \"One Sweet Day\" and it was not my favorite song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know it was kind of a moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you.\"\nElysa Gardner from \"USA Today\" called \"Never Too Far/Hero\" a \"refreshing medley\" and felt it would easily be accepted among Carey's other popular and heartfelt inspirational ballads. The medley was only given a commercial release in the United States. Though \"Hero\" (a single from Carey's album \"Music Box\") had gone to number-one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Never Too Far\" (a single from \"Glitter\") had failed to chart. \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\" performed marginally better, peaking at number eighty-one and remaining on the chart for three weeks, however still not delivering the kind of success Carey was accustomed to prior to \"Glitter\". The charity single was released to help victims of the September 11 attacks, with all proceeds from the sales of the single going towards the Heroes Fund, a charity benefit for victims of the attacks and their families, police officers, and relief workers.\n\nThough having not promoted \"Glitter\" during the time of its release, due to her breakdown and subsequent hospitalization, Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the single, as well as charity benefits for the September 11 attacks victims. At the 2001 Radio Music Awards, Carey made her second public appearance following her breakdown, the first being a performance of \"Hero\" at the \"\" telethon on September 21, 2001. Entering the stage in a long black evening gown, Carey performed the medley live, followed by a standing ovation from the audience. On October 21, 2001, a benefit titled was held at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., accompanied by the charity single \"What More Can I Give\", in which Carey participated. Carey donned a black open-back dress with a plunging neckline, and performed \"Never Too Far/Hero\", followed by a live rendition of \"What More Can I Give\".\n\nOn November 16, 2001, Carey taped a special titled \"A Home For The Holidays With Mariah Carey\", which aired on December 21 of that same year. The special featured additional performances by Destiny's Child, Josh Groban, Enrique Iglesias and Mandy Moore. Carey opened the special, with a performance of \"Never Too Far/Hero\" while wearing a form-fitting red evening gown. Aside from the single, Carey performed \"I'll Be There\" and \"Reflections (Care Enough)\", a single from \"Glitter\". Following stateside promotion of the charity single, Carey performed it alongside Westlife on the British music chart program, \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nUS CD single\n\nNever Too Far/Hero Remixes (European CD Maxi Single)\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Greatest Hits\" liner notes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800993", "title": "New Guinea singing dog", "text": "New Guinea singing dog\n\nThe New Guinea singing dog or New Guinea Highland dog (scientific name: \"Canis hallstromi\", taxonomic classification: \"Canis familiaris\" or \"Canis lupus dingo\") is a dog native to the New Guinea Highlands of the island of New Guinea. Its taxonomic status is debated. It is closely related to the Australian dingo.\n\nThe dog is noted for its unique vocalization. Little is known about New Guinea singing dogs in the wild, and there are only two photographs of possible wild sightings. In 1989, the Australian mammalogist Tim Flannery took a photo of a black-and-tan dog in Telefomin District. He wrote that these dogs live with native people in the mountains, and that there were feral populations living in the alpine and sub-alpine grasslands of the Star Mountains and the Wharton Range. The photo was published in his book \"Mammals of New Guinea\". In 2012, Australian wilderness adventure guide Tom Hewett took a photo of a tawny, thick-coated dog in the Puncak Mandala region of West Papua, Indonesia.\n\nIn 2016, a literature review found that there is no definitive evidence that the founding members of captive populations of New Guinea singing dogs were wild-living animals; they were raised as members of village populations of domestic dogs.\n\nIn 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of \"Mammal Species of the World\" published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf \"Canis lupus\" its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: \"\"familiaris\" Linnaeus, 1758 [domestic dog]\" and \"\"dingo\" Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\". Wozencraft included \"hallstromi\" – the New Guinea singing dog – as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision. The inclusion of \"familiaris\" and \"dingo\" under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists. This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea Singing Dog and the Dingo to be feral dogs \"Canis familiaris\", and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.\n\nDuring the Torres expedition to the south coast of New Guinea and the Torres Strait in 1606, small dogs were recorded by Captain Don Diego de Prado Y Tovar:\n\nOn 26 October 1897, the Lieutenant-Governor of British New Guinea, Sir William MacGregor, was on Mount Scratchley, Central Province, Papua New Guinea. At an elevation of he recorded that \"animals are rare\", but listed \"wild dog\". MacGregor obtained the first specimen and later Charles Walter De Vis wrote a description of it in 1911. De Vis summarised from his description that:\n\n... it is not a \"truly a wild dog\"; in other words that there was a time when its forebears were not wild. ...But if we decide that this dog is merely feral, of a domestic breed run wild, as dogs are apt to do, how are we to account for its habitat on Mount Scratchley?\n\nIn 1954, collectors for the Australian Museum observed these dogs around villages situated at on Mount Giluwe in the Southern Highlands Province. In 1956, Albert Speer and J. P. Sinclair obtained a pair of singing dogs in the Lavani Valley that was situated in Southern Highlands Province. The two dogs had been obtained from natives. The dogs were sent to Sir Edward Hallstrom who had set up a native animal study center in Nondugi, and from there to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. In 1957, Ellis Troughton examined the two singing dog specimens from the Taronga Zoo and classified them as a distinct species \"Canis hallstromi\" in honour of Hallstrom.\n\nTroughton described the type specimen as follows:\n\nWhole genome sequencing indicates the domestic dog to be a genetically divergent subspecies of the gray wolf; the dog is not a descendant of the extant gray wolf, but these are sister taxa which share a common ancestor from a ghost population of wolves that went extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, and the dog and the dingo are not separate species. The dingo and the Basenji are basal members of the domestic dog clade. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicates that the dingo falls within the domestic dog clade, and that the New Guinea singing dog is genetically closer to those dingoes that live in southeastern Australia than to those that live in the northwest. The dingo and New Guinea singing dog lineage can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia. Gene flow from the genetically divergent Tibetan wolf forms 2% of the dingo's genome, which likely represents ancient admixture in eastern Eurasia.\n\nAt the end of the Last glacial maximum and the associated rise in sea levels, Tasmania became separated from the Australian mainland 12,000 YBP, and New Guinea 6,500–8,500 YBP by the inundation of the Sahul Shelf. Fossil remains in Australia date to approximately 3,500 YBP and no dingo remains have been uncovered in Tasmania; therefore, the dingo is estimated to have arrived in Australia at a time between 3,500-12,000 YBP. To reach Australia through the Malay Archipelago even at the lowest sea level of the Last Glacial Maximum, a journey of at least 50 km over open sea between ancient Sunda and Sahul was necessary, indicating that the dingo arrived by boat.\n\nIn 2016, a literature review found that:\nAustralian mammalogist Tim Flannery in his book the \"Mammals of New Guinea\" describes the \"New Guinea Wild Dog\" as looking similar to the dingo, only smaller. Most of these dogs in New Guinea are domesticated with large numbers being kept by widows and bachelors, with hunters keeping at least two for assisting them with hunting. These dogs do not bark, and their chorused howling makes a haunting and extraordinary sound, which has led to their alternative name of \"New Guinea Singing Dog\". Flannery published in his book a photo of a black-and-tan dog in the Telefomin District. He wrote that these dogs live with native people in the mountains, and that there were feral populations living in the alpine and sub-alpine grasslands of the Star Mountains and the Wharton Range.\n\nCompared with other species in its genus, the New Guinea singing dog is described as relatively short-legged and broad-headed. These dogs have an average shoulder height of and weigh . They do not have rear dewclaws.\n\nThe limbs and spine of the New Guinea singing dog are very flexible and they can spread their legs sideways to 90°, comparable to the Norwegian Lundehund. They can also rotate their front and hind paws more than domestic dogs, which enables them to climb trees with thick bark or branches that can be reached from the ground; however, their climbing skills do not reach the same level as those of the gray fox.\n\nThe eyes, which are highly reflective, are triangular (or almond-shaped) and are angled upwards from the inner to outer corners with dark eye rims. Eye color ranges from dark amber to dark-brown. Their eyes exhibit a bright green glow when lights are shone on them in low light conditions. There are two features which researchers believe allow New Guinea singing dogs to see more clearly in low light. One is that of their pupils, which open wider and allow in more light than in other dog varieties. The other is that they possess a higher concentration of cells in the tapetum.\n\nNew Guinea singing dogs have erect, pointed, fur-lined ears. As with other wild dogs, the ears 'perk', or lay forward, which is suspected to be an important survival feature for the species. The ears can be rotated like a directional receiver to pick up faint sounds. Their tails are bushy, long enough to reach the hock, free of kinks, and have a white tip.\n\nPups are born with a dark chocolate brown pelt with gold flecks and reddish tinges, which changes to light brown by the age of six weeks. Adult coloration occurs around four months of age. For adult dogs, the colors brown, black, and tan have been reported, all with white points. The sides of the neck and zonal stripes behind the scapula are golden. Black and very dark guard hair is generally lightly allocated over the hair of the spine, concentrating on the back of the ears and the surface of the tail over the white tip. The muzzle is always black on young dogs. Generally, all colors have white markings underneath the chin, on the paws, chest and tail tip. About one third also have white markings on the muzzle, face and neck. By 7 years of age, the black muzzle begins to turn gray.\n\nAll sightings in the wild were of single dogs or pairs, therefore it can be inferred that wild New Guinea singing dogs do not form permanent packs. Tim Flannery's short 1989 report on dogs in the mountains of Papua New Guinea described them as \"extraordinarily shy\" and \"almost preternaturally canny\". According to Robert Bino (1996), these dogs only use their resting places under roots and ledges in New Guinea sporadically. Bino conjectured that these dogs are highly mobile and forage alone and concluded that they therefore might use several hiding places in their home range.\n\nDuring research observations, the examined dogs generally showed a lower threshold of behavior (e.g., scent rolling) than other domestic dogs, as well as an earlier developmental onset than other domestic dogs or grey wolves (e.g., hackle biting at two weeks compared to other domestic dogs/grey wolves at 6 weeks) and a quantitative difference (e.g., reduced expression of intraspecific affiliate behaviors). The dogs observed did not show the typical canid play bow; however, Imke Voth found this behavior during examinations in the 1980s.\n\nSeveral behaviors unique to New Guinea singing dogs have been noted:\n\n\nAdditionally, New Guinea singing dogs have an unusual form of auto-erotic stimulation, which includes a strong tendency to target the genitals for both playful and aggressive bites, a cheek-rub that may be a marking behavior and a tooth-gnashing threat.\n\nDuring estrus, when potential partners are present, same-sex New Guinea singing dogs often fight to the point of severe injury. Furthermore, adults also display a high degree of aggression towards unfamiliar dogs, which would indicate that they are strongly territorial. Their distinctive aggression could not be observed to that extent among Australian dingoes (who live without human contact).\n\nResearchers have noted rough play behavior by the mothers towards their pups, which often switched over to agonistic behavior as well as \"handling\". The mothers did not adequately react to the pups' shouts of pain but rather interpreted it as further \"invitation\" for \"playing\". The researchers stated that this behavior was noted in their subjects only and does not necessarily apply to all singing dogs.\n\nNew Guinea singing dogs are named for their distinctive and melodious howl, which is characterized by a sharp increase in pitch at the start and very high frequencies at the end. According to observations made by Ortolani, the howling of these dogs can be clearly differentiated from that of Australian dingoes, and differs significantly from that of grey wolves and coyotes.\n\nAn individual howl lasts an average of 3 seconds, but can last as long as 5 seconds. At the start, the frequency rises and stabilizes for the rest of the howling, but normally shows abrupt changes in frequency. Modulations can change quickly every 300–500 milliseconds or every second. Five to eight overtones can generally be distinguished in a spectrographic analysis of the howling. Their howl reportedly has been compared to the song of a humpback whale.\n\nNew Guinea singing dogs sometimes howl together, which is commonly referred to as chorus howling. During chorus howling, one dog starts and others join in shortly afterward. In most cases, chorus howling is well synchronized, and the howls of the group end nearly simultaneously. Spontaneous howling is most common during the morning and evening hours. A trill, with a distinctly \"bird-like\" character, is emitted during high arousal. It is a high-frequency pulsed signal whose spectral appearance suggests a continuous source that is periodically interrupted, and might last as long as 800 milliseconds. Such a sound is not known for any other canid; however, a similar sound (with lower frequency) has been described for a dhole at the Moscow Zoo. When they are kept with dogs that bark, New Guinea singing dogs may mimic the other dogs.\n\nLike other dingo types, female New Guinea singing dogs come into heat once a year, rather than twice a year normally associated with domestic dog breeds. Their breeding season generally starts in August and ends during December. Gestation averages 63 days. In Tierpark Berlin, 80% of the litters were born in October and November and the gestation period was 58–64 days. The litter size was 1–6 pups. Reports of 25 female singing dogs in captivity showed that when they did not conceive during their first annual estrus, about 65% have a second estrus cycle, sometimes even a third, 8–16 weeks later.\n\nMales in captivity often participate in raising the pups, including the regurgitation of food. Female New Guinea singing dogs are protective of their young and will aggressively attack their male counterpart if they suspect he poses a danger to the pups. During the first breeding season following their birth, especially if there is a potential mate present, pups are often aggressively attacked by the same-sex parent.\n\nReports from local sources in Papua New Guinea from the 1970s and the mid-1990s indicate that New Guinea singing dogs-like wild dogs found in New Guinea, whether they were pure New Guinea singing dogs or hybrids-fed on small to middle-sized marsupials, rodents, birds, and fruits. Robert Bino stated that their prey consisted of cuscuses, wallabies, dwarf cassowaries, and other birds.New Guinea singing dogs in captivity do not require a specialized diet, but they seem to thrive on lean raw meat diets based on poultry, beef, elk, deer, or bison.\n\nNew Guinea singing dogs have been reported engaging in kleptoparasitic behavior towards Papuan eagles. In turn, the birds have been known to kill adult dogs.\n\nSince 1956, New Guinea singing dogs have been obtained or sighted in the wild chiefly in mountainous terrain around the central segment of the New Guinea Highlands, a major island-extensive east–west running mountain range formation, as the 1956 dogs obtained by Speer and Sinclair (see 'History and classification' section above) were in what's now typically spelled the Lavani Valley slightly to the East, the Star Mountains slightly to the West of center sited reports through 1976. Reports of the Kalam people capturing New Guinea singing dogs in the mid-1970s imply the human tribe's range just off center east on the northeastern mainland coast (see 'Relationship with humans' section below). A 2007 sighting in the Kaijende Highlands was east of the center. The 2012 sighting was near Puncak Mandala slightly to the west, all in the highlands around the range's spine.\n\nThe reported habitat of the New Guinea singing dog consists of mountains and swampy mountain regions of Papua New Guinea at an altitude of 2,500 to 4,700 meters. The main vegetation zones are the mixed forest, beech and mossy forest, sub-alpine coniferous forest and alpine grassland. Based on archaeological, ethnographic, and circumstantial evidence, it can be assumed that New Guinea singing dogs were once distributed over the whole of New Guinea and later restricted to the upper mountains. Since there have been no verified sightings of these dogs in Papua New Guinea since the 1970s until an August 2012 photograph in the wild, these dogs are now apparently rare.\n\nThere were reports of New Guinea singing dogs in the Star Mountains until 1976, and in the mid-1970s reports of capture and training, but not breeding by the Kalam people (see 'Relationship with humans' section below).\n\nIn his 1998 book \"Throwim Way Leg\", Tim Flannery states that the dokfuma (which he describes as sub-alpine grassland with the ground being sodden moss, lichens and herbs growing atop a swamp) at 3,200 meters elevation had plenty of New Guinea singing dogs, which could usually be heard at the beginning and end of each day. When alone in his campsite one day, a group of canines came within several hundred meters of him. Flannery apparently did not have his camera along or ready, since he reported no pictures taken.\n\nIn 1996 Robert Bino undertook a field study of these dogs, but was not able to observe any wild New Guinea singing dogs and instead used signs, such as scats, paw prints, urine markings and prey remnants, to make conclusions about their behavior. No DNA sampling was conducted. There have been reports from local residents that wild dogs have been seen or heard in higher reaches of the mountains.\n\nIn a 2007 report, a more recent sighting was the fleeting glimpse of a dog at Lake Tawa in the Kaijende Highlands. Local assistants assured the researchers that the dogs at Lake Tawa were wild-living dogs, since there were no villages near that location. It needs to be made clear, however, that \"wild-living\" does not necessarily mean that canines observed by natives are New Guinea singing dogs. It is possible that they are simply feral domestic dogs or New Guinea singing dog hybrids.\n\nOn 24 August 2012, the second known photograph of a New Guinea singing dog in the wild was taken by Tom Hewitt, Director of Adventure Alternative Borneo, in the Jayawijaya Mountains or Star Mountains of Papua Province, Indonesia, Western New Guinea by a trek party returning from Puncak Mandala, at approximately 4,760 m high the highest peak in the Jayawijaya range and second highest freestanding mountain of Oceania, Australasia, New Guinea and Indonesia (though Hewitt himself seems to erroneously say this peak is in the Star Mountains, which are adjacent to the Jayawijaya range, and also casually calls the region 'West Papua' rather than Indonesia's Papua Province in the Western geopolitical 'half' of the New Guinea landmasses, while his identification of the peak is quite clear, including its estimated elevation which is distinctive among New Guinea's peaks). In a valley flanked by waterfalls on both sides among approximately high limestone peaks, replete with such flora and fauna as cycads, grasses and blooms of the highlands, cuscuses, possums, tree kangaroos, unidentified ground-nesting birds in swamp grass, and a bird-of-paradise species heard but not seen, Hewitt relates that his veteran trek guide called out \"dog\" four times and pointed to fetch Hewitt and his trek client from their explorations behind large boulders and have them realize that ahead and above the guide and camp cook on a rocky outcrop was a dog, in Hewitt's words \"not scared, but...genuinely curious...as we were of it, and it certainly felt like a rare meeting for both sides. The guides and cook were also surprised.” While the guide had at first approached \"quite close\", the dog retreated as the party came toward it, though it stayed on the hillside while being photographed for a mutual observation session of about 15 minutes. Hewitt only became fully aware of the importance of his party's sighting and photograph of this dog when he contacted Tom Wendt, New Guinea Singing Dog International (NGSDI)'s founder upon returning home, then regretting that he did not videorecord the encounter. Hewitt and Wendt observe that West Papuan locals report that sightings are rare, and that New Guinea singing dogs have not been domesticated by current human inhabitants of their area.\n\nIn 2016, the New Guinea Highland Wild Dog Foundation announced to the media that it and the University of Papua had located and photographed a group of 15 of what it referred to as \"highland wild dogs\". DNA analysis of scats indicate that these dogs have a genetic relationship with other oceanic dogs, including the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog.\n\nIn 2016, a literature review found that \"there is no definitive evidence that...the founding members of captive populations of New Guinea Singing Dogs were wild-living animals or the progeny of wild-living animals rather than being born and raised as members of village populations of domestic dogs.\"\n\nAccording to the New Guinea Singing Dog Conservation Society as of 2015, the complete list of zoos around the world where captive New Guinea singing dogs are kept is short relative to most zoo species, highlighting their varietal endangered condition after suspected extinction in the wild and the paucity of the zoo gene pool.\n\nThe onset of European culture's domestic dogs spelled the beginning of the end for pure New Guinea singing dogs in the lowlands. \"Singing Dogs are very gentle and friendly with people, though inclined to be a bit shy with strangers at first,\" wrote New York owner Phillip Persky. \"They are not at all aggressive with people\" Sharon McKenzie said. \"They are notorious escape artists,\" Mr. Persky reported, \"and can climb and jump with cat-like agility, so enclosures have to be secure.\" \"They are great diggers and can climb fences as easily as a squirrel.\"\nAccording to reports from the late 1950s and mid-1970s, wild dogs believed to be New Guinea singing dogs were shy and avoided contact with humans. It was reported in the mid-1970s that the Kalam in the highlands of Papua caught young New Guinea singing dogs and raised them as hunting aids, but did not breed them. Some of these dogs probably stayed with the Kalam and reproduced. The Eipo tribe kept and bred wild dogs as playmates for their children. Although the majority of the highland tribes never used village dogs as a food source, it is known that even today they attempt to catch, kill and eat wild dogs. Dog-findings in archaeological sites of New Guinea are rare, mostly consisting of teeth (used as ornaments) and trophy-skulls. One grave has been discovered. The earliest New Guinea singing dog remains was a tooth found in the lowlands. It was estimated to be about 5,500 years old. Findings from the highlands were thought to be of similar age, on a stratigraphical basis, but as of 2001 had not been dated. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the inhabitants of the highlands started to keep chickens, and New Guinea singing dogs had a penchant for poultry. To add to the problem, natives kept other domestic dogs. The crossbred dogs were generally larger in size, as well as less of a challenge to train, so they tended to be of more value than New Guinea singing dogs. One might conclude that the relationship between the contemporary New Guineans and their dogs will give information about how they treated the New Guinea singing dogs, but modern \"village dogs\" are not genetically representative of pure New Guinea singing dogs.\n\nIn the past, the New Guinea singing dog was considered \"unworthy\" of scientific study, as it was regarded as an insignificant variety of feral domestic dog. However, due to its potential value as a resource for the determination of the process of canid evolution and domestication, particularly in relation to the dingo, as well as several of its unique genetic, behavioral, ecological, reproductive and morphological characteristics, limited research has been undertaken. The New Guinea Department of Environment and Conservation has announced protection measures.\n\nHybridization is one of the most serious threats facing the New Guinea singing dog. New Guinea singing dogs are handicapped, as are many canids such as the Australian dingo, by their susceptibility to being bred by canines other than those of their own kind. This vulnerability has, and is still, causing a \"watering down\" of dingo genes needed to maintain purity.\n\nThere are three organizations that exist for the sole purpose of conserving and preserving New Guinea singing dogs. They are the New Guinea Singing Dog Conservation Society, founded in 1997, New Guinea Singing Dog International, a preservation, captive breed, adoption and pet education group, and Wizard of Paws Wildlife Education Inc. All of these organizations are based in the United States.\n\n\n"}

He served as Archbishop of Madrid from 1994 to 2014. He was made a cardinal in 1998.\n\nAntonio Rouco Varela was born in Vilalba to Vicente Rouco and María Eugenia Varela, the latter of whom hailed from Bahía Blanca, Argentina. He has four siblings: Visitación, Jose, Manuel, and Eugenia. He studied at the seminary in Mondoñedo and at the Pontifical University of Salamanca (1954–1958), from where he obtained his licentiate in theology. Rouco was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Francisco Barbado y Viejo, OP, on 28 March 1959.\n\nHe then furthered his studies at the University of Munich, earning a doctorate in canon law in 1964 with a dissertation on church-state relations in 16th century Spain. He held a series of academic posts, teaching fundamental theology, canon law, and ecclesiastical law at the seminary of Mondoñedo, and the University of Munich. In 1976 he was appointed titular Bishop of Gergi and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela by Pope Paul VI. Named Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela in 1984 by Pope John Paul II, he played a key role in the hosting of the 4th World Youth Day in 1989. Five years later, in 1994, he was named Archbishop of Madrid by Pope John Paul II.\n\nJohn Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Lorenzo in Damaso in the consistory of 21 February 1998. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. In 2011, he was the incumbent Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid, when Pope Benedict XVI made a Papal Visit to the city for World Youth Day 2011. Also that year, the was founded in Madrid.

Having passed 80, he will not be an elector in the next papal election.\n\nCardinal Rouco Varela is a known supporter of the Neocatechumenal Way. Along with its founder, Kiko Arguello, he has co-ordinated massive rallies on 31 December 2007 and 2008 known as 'family days' to promote the Catholic family model and to oppose same-sex marriage.\n\nHe led the opposition to the Socialist Spanish government over abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid, he had the Neo-Gothic Almudena Cathedral decorated with paintings by Neocatechumenal artist Kiko Argüello and mosaics by Father Marko Ivan Rupnik.\n\nCardinal Rouco Varela claims that he wishes to convince young people that Christ really loves them and wants them to be happy. He invites them \"for a profound, authentic and joyful encounter with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who calls young people in his Church so that their lives, often depressed and broken, and others fresh and vigorous, will be rooted and built up in Him, the only one who can offer them and give them truth, hope and love; the only one who can show them the right direction and accompany them on the way that leads to genuine and lasting happiness\" as he wrote in a letter just before the World Youth Day of 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801019", "title": "Holland Marsh", "text": "Holland Marsh\n\nThe Holland Marsh is a wetland and agricultural area in Ontario, Canada, about north of Toronto. It lies entirely within the valley of the Holland River, stretching from the northern edge of the Oak Ridges Moraine near Schomberg to the river mouth at Cook's Bay, Lake Simcoe. In its entirety it comprises about 21,000 acres (8,500 hectares), with two distinct divisions. Historically it has simply been referred to as \"the marsh\".\n\nThe first area to be drained and reclaimed for farming is a 7,200-acre (2,915-hectare) municipally drained polder south-west of the town of Bradford proper, of which 40% lies in King Township (York Region) and 60% in the town of Bradford West Gwillimbury (Simcoe County).\n\nThe other 13,800 acres (5,585 hectares) lie north and east of Bradford, fringing Cook's Bay in the townships of Innisfil and East Gwillimbury. Portions of this area have been privately reclaimed for farming, such as the Ravenshoe Road and Bradford Marsh areas, and portions are recreational or undisturbed wetland. In some cases, recreational boating, wetland and agricultural areas intersect.\n\nThe flat reclaimed areas consist of fertile organic soil, ideal for growing market garden crops such as onions, leafy greens, celery and carrots. Organic matter consists of living plant tissues and organisms found in soil. Organic matter improves the physical condition of soil, and residues from its decomposition play an important role in holding plant nutrients and water. Organic matter in soil undergoes change as it breaks down and decomposes and new material is added. Careful management of this soil is necessary to prevent wind erosion. Much of the fertile, organic soil has been depleted due to unsustainable use by farmers over the years. Submerged decayed trees contribute highly to the valuable fibrous nature of the soil, but without human assistance and ingenuity, the area would have little fertility.\n\nThe main crops of the area are vegetables which reflect each wave of immigration into Canada, and have traditionally been grown by immigrants for ethnic markets in the Greater Toronto Area and for export. The agricultural plots were originally divided into \"market garden\" family farms, and produce was taken to local markets. In the 1920s the main crops reflected eastern and western European tastes - yellow onions, potatoes, carrots, head lettuce, radish, etc. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Italian greens started to be grown, for example dandelion, escarole, and endive. Demand for Asian greens, such as bok choy, began in the 1990s. With the opening of Highway 400 in the 1950s, farmers quickly gained access to the Ontario Food Terminal in Toronto, vastly expanding their market. Yonge Street and the CN rail (Toronto - Barrie) are situated to the northeast. When the federal government relaxed food import rules in the 1990s and grocery stores consolidated to form large chains across Canada, small family farms growing diverse crops were, for the most part, no longer financially feasible, but a few small family farms still survive. Corporate farms that had bought land in the 1950s sold their plots and a few family farms consolidated, growing mostly onions and carrots for grocery stores, export and food processing companies. Recently the Greenbelt family farmers market introduced by the Ontario government has helped some small family farms.\n\nAt the nearby Muck Crops Research Station, located on the southernmost polder, various studies research the effects of altering specific agricultural practices. These typically focus on, and are intended for implementation, on Holland Marsh farms.\n\nAccording to the Ontario government Holland Marsh Schedule 3 Greenbelt map, all of Holland Marsh - whether designated agricultural, recreational or wetland - is a specialty soil region. The southernmost polder sits on the lowest lying, flat area, consisting of , of the Lake Simcoe Watershed region. The area is oval shaped, with the narrowest points at the northwest and southeast. This polder's length is about 15 km and its width about 4 km. The location runs from 44 to 44.15 N and from 73.8 to about 73.65 W. The Holland River's main branch meets the polder's north and south canals near the intersection of Bridge Street and Canal Road in Bradford.\n\nBefore its development, the entire area was a large wetland extending almost continuously along the western arm of the Holland River. It was part of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, although another route to the east was also used, avoiding the dense marshy area. In the 1880s a mattress-stuffing business flourished as reeds were harvested first by hand with scythes then by horse-drawn mowers. Horses were ferried by flat-bottomed scows across flooded areas, wearing large boards on their hooves so as not to sink into the soggy ground.\n\nIn October 1954, Hurricane Hazel overwhelmed the polder's drainage system with unprecedented heavy rains, resulting in the dykes being breached at the north canal. Within six hours the whole area was flooded. The canals were designed with the bank on the outside of the marsh several inches lower than the bank on the inside, so that flooding will occur outside of the marsh first, but the amount of runoff flowing into the valley from the surrounding uplands was so great that this failsafe became ineffective. The pipes below the marsh, which opened into the canal system with one-way valves to prevent flooding, also became ineffective. Highway 400 was five feet underwater. The residents were alerted to the flood because it happened in the evening when they had returned from their fields, and the party phone line rang in all the homes as residents called each other to warn of the flood. Those with houses that had only one floor escaped to neighbours with a second floor, and many had boats or canoes that they used for recreation. Many residents were taken in over the winter by neighbours in the town of Bradford.\n\nOn May 31, 1985, a tornado touched down in the Bradford West Gwillimbury portion of the marsh west of Hwy. 400, lifting the roof off of one house on north Canal Road (Simcoe Road #8), and downing power lines and trees and ruining at least one house along Fraser Street. The devastation on Fraser Street was so extensive that it was renamed Tornado Road. The wind of the accompanying storm was of such velocity that many acres of crops were ruined. The storm also resulted in a tornado touching down in Barrie, killing eight and injuring 155 persons, and a tornado touching down in Bolton, destroying at least one house and injuring a teenage girl who was airlifted to hospital and later fully recovered.\n\nProfessor William Day led the project to reclaim the large southernmost Holland Marsh polder, which was completed in 1930. The canal system was created by engineer Alexander Baird of Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nDuring prolonged droughts, the Holland Marsh is prone to dust storms. A chance of dust storms only exists in the spring before the crops have a chance to grow or in the fall after the crops are harvested. This has happened once in the last 10 years.\n\n"}

It is located on a 1,770-acre (7.2 km²) site in Rhea County, Tennessee, near Spring City, between the cities of Chattanooga and Knoxville. Watts Bar supplies enough electricity for about 1,200,000 households in the Tennessee Valley.\n\nThe plant, construction of which began in 1973, has two Westinghouse pressurized water reactor units: Unit 1, completed in 1996, and Unit 2, completed in 2015. Unit 1 has a winter net dependable generating capacity of 1,167 megawatts. Unit 2 has a capacity of 1,165 megawatts. Both units are the newest operating civilian reactors to come online in the United States, and Unit 2 is the first and only new reactor to enter service in the 21st century.\n\nThe construction began on 23 January 1973, and suffered from many delays. After construction was halted on both units in 1985, construction resumed on Unit 1 in 1992. First criticality was achieved on 1 January 1996 and commercial operation began on May 5, 1996.\n\nUnit 2 was 80% complete when construction on both units was stopped in 1985 due in part to a projected decrease in power demand. In 2007, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board approved completion of Unit 2 on August 1, and construction resumed on October 15. The project was expected to cost $2.5 billion, and employ around 2,300 contractor workers. Once finished, it was expected to employ 250 people in permanent jobs. The final cost of the plant is estimated at $6.1 billion.\n\nA year after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued 9 orders to improve safety at domestic plants. Two applied to Watts Bar Unit 2 and required design modifications: \"Mitigation Strategies Order\" and \"Spent Fuel Pool Instrumentation Order\". In February 2012, TVA said the design modifications to Watts Bar 2 were partially responsible for the project running over budget and behind schedule. The second unit cost a total of $4.7 billion bringing the total cost of the plant to more than $12 billion.\n\nTVA declared construction substantially complete in August 2015 and requested that NRC staff proceed with the final licensing review; on October 22, the NRC approved a forty-year operating license for Unit 2, marking the formal end of construction and allowing for the installation of nuclear fuel and subsequent testing. On December 15, 2015, TVA announced that the reactor was fully loaded with fuel and ready for criticality and power ascension tests. In March 2016, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission described the project as a \"chilled work environment,\" where employees are reluctant to raise safety concerns for fear of retribution.\n\nOn May 23, 2016, initial criticality was achieved. , a transformer fire had delayed the start of commercial operation past the late summer goal. Commercial operation started in October 2016, once the affected transformer was replaced, operators completed the inspection on the switchyard affected equipment and the final full power testing was completed. On October 19, 2016 the Watts Bar 2 was the first United States reactor to enter commercial operation since 1996. Due to failures in its condenser, TVA took it offline on March 23, 2017. The condenser, which was installed during the original construction phase of the plant in the 1970s, suffered a structural failure in one of its sections. On August 1, 2017 the unit was restarted after four months of repairs to the condenser.\n\nIt will likely be the last Generation II reactor to be completed in the US.\n\nThe NRC operating license for Watts Bar was modified in September 2002 to allow TVA to irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods at Watts Bar to produce tritium for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Nuclear Security Administration. The Watts Bar license amendment currently permits TVA to irradiate up to approximately 2,000 tritium-producing rods in the Watts Bar reactor.\n\nTVA began irradiating tritium-producing rods at Watts Bar Unit 1 in the fall of 2003. TVA removed these rods from the reactor in the spring of 2005. DOE successfully shipped them to its tritium-extraction facility at Savannah River Site in South Carolina. DOE reimburses TVA for the cost of providing the irradiation services, and also pays TVA a fee for each tritium-producing rod that is irradiated. As the tritium is used for military purposes, Watts Bar unit 1 is fuelled by uranium which does not have peaceful only use non-proliferation restrictions as is normal for commercial reactors.\n\nThe NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Watts Bar was 18,452, an increase of 4.1 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,186,648, an increase of 12.8 percent since 2000.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Watts Bar was 1 in 27,778, according to an NRC study published in August 2010. The 2018 Southern Appalachian earthquake's epicenter was located two miles east of the facility. The TVA reported that their facilities are designed to withstand seismic events and were not impacted by the earthquake, but personnel would conduct further inspections as a precaution.\n\n\n"}

The Pitch Bend Wheel has no equivalent on the MG-1.\n\nThe MG-1 was produced in great quantities for distribution in the consumer market. Because it was originally distributed in Radio Shack stores instead of specialized music stores, it is easily found and is usually less expensive than a Rogue despite actually offering more. It is identifiable by the big \"REALISTIC\" name in white letters on the back (instead of the letters \"MOOG\") and the lack of Pitch Bend and Modulation wheels but, in smaller print at the back, it clearly states: \"Custom manufactured by Moog Music in U.S.A. for Radio Shack, a division of Tandy Corporation\".\n\nThe Polyphonic features of this synth are of particular interest as polyphony was rare in synthesizers of the time. The square wave based polyphony section is described as a \"cheesy organ sound\" by some, and well-used by others. Since the polyphony section is independently tunable, it can function as a rudimentary third oscillator, allowing the user to create more complex tones than on similar 2-oscillator synths. All of the sound-generating features come together in a mixer allowing the levels for the two monophonic tone sources, noise, bell tone and polyphony to be adjusted independently. The multiple notes of polyphony feed into the single filter, giving a paraphonic result. In 1982-3, few electronic musical instruments had the MG-1 combination of paraphonic poly section and monophonic synthesizer in one instrument.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the Poly tones are not affected by the Contour settings. In reality the Poly tones can be affected by the Rise Time (attack) and Fall Time (decay) sliders. The Contour settings can only affect Polyphony while a key is pressed due to the Polyphonic gate design. When a key is released the polyphony tone for that key stops immediately. Therefore, it is true that the Poly tones are not \"faded out\" by the Fall time (release) contour setting when a key is released. Similarly, the Poly tones are not \"held\" with the two VCOs when in \"Continuous\" (Hold or drone) mode. The rest of the modulation, including the sample-and-hold, will affect the Polyphonic Signal via the filter section. One thing to note however; the LFO cannot be used to modulate the pitch to create a vibrato of the Polyphony section. Against these limitations, the Polyphony is total, meaning all 32 keys can sound all at once.\n\nWhen the Contour (Envelope) is triggered by the LFO, it allows for periodic LFO-type waves to be applied to the VCF or VCA, depending on the Rise- and Fall-times. This allows the creation of Saw- and Ramp- waves, as well as asymmetrical Triangle waves and unusual trapezoids, not otherwise found through modulating with the LFO alone.\n\nAlthough this keyboard is often erroneously described as having \"less\" features than its Moog siblings, the Liberation and the Rogue, there is a patch which only the MG-1 can do: The LFO can have \"independent\" amounts sent to the VCOs \"and\" the VCF on the MG-1. The Liberation and Rogue have to route \"both\" through the Mod Wheel with the \"same\" amount level. This is the benefit of not having the standard pitch- and mod-wheels.\n\nThe synthesizer's features aren't labelled using the usual synthesizer nomenclature, instead using more \"laymen friendly\" terms such as \"Tone Source\" for the oscillators, \"Contour\" for the envelope with \"Rise Time\" for Attack Time and \"Fall Time\" instead of Decay or Release Time. Portamento is called \"Glide\" and Ring Mod is \"Bell Tone\".\n\nThe colour scheme is more appealing and vibrant and helps distinguish easily between sections, again for an easier understanding by the general public not familiar with analog synthesizers.\n\nStill, this synthesizer is sought-after as an inexpensive way to get the famed \"Moog Bass\" sounds. It is also somewhat infamous in analog synth circles for having black polyurethane foam insulating the interior which did not keep well over time, turning into a black sludge which clogs the various moving parts in the synth (so much so that entire replacement switches and faders can be bought on eBay, specifically for this synth). As with many analog synthesizers, the MG-1's resale price is slowly rising as alternatives and working instruments become less common, and buyers and sellers congregate online.\n\nAlthough a picture of Elton John holding the MG-1 on his arm appears alongside the description of this synthesizer in Radio Shack's 1982 and 1983 catalogs, he has never actually used it in any of his recordings or performances. The photo was the product of a publicity contract with the Tandy Corporation.\n\n\n\n"}

He did not enjoy as much success at the international level as he did at the first class level. In first-class matches, he scored nearly 10,000 runs at an average of 40. Dyson is probably best remembered for his \"catch of the century\" at the SCG, West Indies v Australia, 5 January 1982 when he caught Sylvester Clarke in the outfield, over his head, at a 45-degree angle to the ground, running backwards.\n\nDyson participated in two \"rebel tours\" of South Africa in 1985-86 and 1986–87 in defiance of the international sporting boycott of the apartheid state, scoring over 1,000 runs. He played soccer as a goalkeeper in the Sutherland Shire (Cronulla RSL) and was a member of the side that won the Dallimore Competition and runners-up in the NSW Amateur Cup final. He was a team member of the Como West Junior Soccer Club (Sutherland Shire) successful 18A, 1971 Champion of Champion team, progressed to play in Sutherland and St. George Grade and was also selected in the N.S.W. U20 squad.\n\nOn 21 October 2007 he was named as coach of the West Indies having previously coached Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2005. On 20 March 2009 he incorrectly called the West Indies in because of bad light after 46.2 overs over of an ODI against England. His decision to do so was based on a faulty D/L calculation because of a fall of wicket on the second ball of the 47th over, thereby causing his team to lose a match it had a good chance of winning.\n\nHe was sacked as the coach of the West Indies on 13 August 2009 shortly before the team was due to play in the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa.\n\nDyson was made NSW 12th man for a game against the touring West Indies. He then scored 159 for NSW Colts against Victorian Colts.\n\nHe was picked to play for NSW against Qld. He played three first class games with a high score of 28 and was dropped that summer for Graeme Hughes.\n\nDyson made a century against Tasmania for NSW. He scored 342 runs at 42.75.\n\nThe loss of many senior Australian players to World Series Cricket saw spots open up in the Australian test team. In particular there was a lack of openers.\n\nDyson attracted attention with a man of the match innings against Queensland in a Gillette Cup semi final. He followed it with innings of 102 off 366 balls for NSW against WA. He then made 65 against the touring Indians and 103 against Victoria.\n\nAustralia opened with Gary Cosier and Paul Hibbert in the first test. Hibbert was dropped for the second, replaced by John Dyson.\n\nDyson made 53 runs in the first innings, taking part in a crucial partnership of 84 with Bob Simpson. He made 4 in the second but those first innings runs proved especially valuable in a narrow Australian victory. He was kept in the side for the next two tests.\n\nHowever, in those tests, both lost by Australia, Dyson scored 0 and 12 and 26 and 6. He was dropped from the side and was not picked on the subsequent tour of the West Indies.\n\nThat summer he became the first known Sydney player to wear a helmet playing grade cricket. He scored 607 runs at an average of 25.\n\nDyson spent the 1978 Australian winter playing for Haslingden in the Lancashire League.\n\nDyson was unable to force his way back into the test team during the 1978-79 summer. He was dropped from the state side early on for a Gillette Cup game but bounced back to make 57 in a districts game.\n\nDyson was back in the state side replacing Ron Crippin. He scored an impressive 67 against the touring English.\n\nHe went on to score 619 runs at 44.21 including a top score of 197 against Tasmania. However Australian selectors preferred Andrew Hilditch.\n\nDyson scored 55 in a state trial game but was overlooked by NSW in favor of Trevor Chappell. This was controversial because it was felt the selectors had bias towards World Series players. However Dyson soon forced his way back into the side and had a reasonably successful season scoring 729 runs at 42. He was rewarded in selection for the Australian squad to tour England in 1980. He played three first class games with a top score of 33 and was overlooked for the Centenary Test.\n\nDyson had an excellent 1980-81 summer domestically including a record first wicket partnership with Rick McCosker against WA. He was picked in the ODI side and scored 69 and 79 against New Zealand.\n\nHe returned to the test side in 1980-81 scoring 30 and 24 not out against New Zealand. In the following tests he made 28 and 25 and 13 and 16.\n\nDyson kept his spot for the following test series against India. He made 0, 30 and 28 and 16 and 3.\n\nDyson scored 1028 first class runs that summer at 57.11. He was second in the highest Sheffield Shield run scorers in that season - only Greg Chappell amassed more.\n\nDespite his relative lack of success at test level, Dyson's excellent first class form saw him picked in the Australian squad to tour England in 1981.\n\nIn the first test he scored 5 and 38 then made 7 and 1.\n\nIn the third test he scored 102 in the first innings and 34 in the second but the match is best remembered for being a famous Australian defeat.\n\nDyson made 1 and 13 in the fourth test and 0 and 5 for the fifth. He was dropped for the last game and replaced by NSW teammate Dirk Wellham.\n\nDyson missed the three tests against Pakistan. However he scored 98 and 123 for NSW against the West Indian touring side and earned a recall for the second test against the West Indies, scoring 28, a match saving 127 not out and taking his famous \"catch of the century\" In the third test he made 1 and 10.\n\nHe made 709 first class runs that season at 54.53.\n\nHe scored 101 in a McDonald's Cup semi final.\n\nDyson kept his spot for the tour of New Zealand. He made 12, 33 and 1 and 14.\n\nDyson toured Pakistan in 1982, playing all three tests. He started well scoring 87 and 6 then made 23 and 43 and 10 and 51.\n\nDyson played all five tests at home during the 1982-83 Ashes. He had scores of 52 and 12, 1 and 4, 44 and 37, 21 and 31 and 79 and 2.\n\nDyson made 43 & 59 for New South Wales against an England XI at the SCG and 44 in a 50 over match against New Zealand.\n\nHe was dropped from the Australia side in the World Series Cup despite averaging almost 40 in the first 9 matches.\n\nDyson scored 52 against the touring Sri Lanka team for New South Wales at the SCG.\n\nDyson was not selected for the Australian squad competing in the 1983 World Cup.\n\nDyson was overlooked the following summer for the series against Pakistan in favour of Wayne Phillips. He went on to score 1015 runs in the Sheffield Shield at 63.43 including a career best score of 241. He shared the Player of the year award with Brian Davison of Tasmania. Despite this outstanding season he didn't earn a place on the Australian tours to the West Indies and India with his fellow New South Welshman Steve Smith preferred.\n\nDyson returned to the test team in November 1984 to play the West Indies. In his last three tests he made 0 and 30, 13 and 21 and 8 and 5. Dyson did score 98 and 16 for NSW against the West Indies in a tour match prior to the second test. He was dropped for Andrew Hilditch in the fourth test and never regained his spot.\n\nDyson scored 79 in the McDonald's Cup final for NSW in an 88 run win over South Australia and 66 in NSW first innings of the Sheffield Shield final victory against Queensland at the SCG.\n\nHe scored 897 runs at 40.77.\n\nDyson hit 105 in the Tooheys Cup in which locals mixed with elite NSW players.\n\nDuring their successful Sheffield Shield campaign of 1984/85 for NSW teammate Imran Khan said that he hoped Dyson would be selected for the Ashes tour to England in the summer of 1985. However it emerged that Dyson had agreed to participate in an Australian rebel tour to South Africa. Dyson enjoyed two productive trips to South Africa. He scored 577 runs in 1985-86 at 44.38 then made 522 runs at 52.2 the following summer. He was banned from playing in Australia for two years and three years from the international team along with the other rebels.\n\nDyson expressed a desire to regain a place in the test side when his ban was over but he struggled on his return to NSW in January 1988 making 157 runs at 19.62 from 5 games during the 1987/88 season with a highest score of 60 not out. For most of the matches he would open the batting with Mark Taylor.\n\nThe following summer was more successful, scoring 742 runs at 39.05 including 79 and 100 not out for NSW against the touring West Indians and 34 for NSW against Pakistan. He scored 112 not out against Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield at the SCG which was his nineteenth and final first-class century. Dyson's good form led to speculation he could earn a place on the tour to England for the 1989 Ashes series however he was not selected.\n\nDyson captained NSW for two FAI cup games at the start of the 1989-90 season but suffered a knee injury and was replaced in the side by Steve Small for the first Sheffield Shield match against South Australia in Adelaide. The selectors then preferred promising prospect Geoff Milliken and Dyson never regained his state place. He had amassed 9935 first class runs at an average of 40.\n\nDyson continued to play first grade cricket for Sutherland and was captain of the side which included a young Glenn McGrath.\n\nIn 1991, NSW captain Geoff Lawson attempted to persuade the selectors to recall Dyson but they decided against it.\n\nHe continued to play grade cricket until 1994.\n\nDyson was NSW's Assistant Coach to Lawson from 1995-97.\n\nHe represented Australia in two masters tournaments (1995 and 1998).\n\n\n"}

Driscoll was British featherweight champion and won the coveted Lonsdale belt in 1910. He is a member of the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame, the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nDriscoll was born in Cardiff in 1880 to Cornelius and Elizabeth, and was brought up on Ellen Street in the Newtown region of the town. Driscoll's parents were both Irish, and both Catholicism and the local St Paul's Church would be key in his life. Driscoll never forgot his roots; he was a faithful supporter of his church, remained close to his community, and had great affection for the Nazareth House Orphanage, for whom he once gave up the chance of becoming Featherweight Champion of the World.\n\nDriscoll's father died in a goods yard accident before Driscoll was one. His mother was forced to accept parish relief to bring up her four children, and soon the family moved into a boarding house with another five people in 3 Ellen Street. Elizabeth was forced to take a job shovelling vegetables and fish from the hulls of ships at Cardiff Docks. Growing up in poverty, Driscoll took employment while still a boy, becoming a printer's devil for the \"Evening Express\" in St. Mary Street in Cardiff.\n\nDriscoll was an apprentice with the Western Mail printing works, when he began boxing in the fairground booths of south Wales. He fought on the boxing booths of South Wales for a number of years and had somewhere in the region of 600 fights before turning professional in 1901, and by the end of the year he had secured twelve wins without defeat. The following year, of the seven recorded fights, he only failed to win once, a draw with Harry Mansfield in Cardiff. Between 1903 and 1904 Driscoll continued fighting, mainly in Wales, but on 22 February 1904 he fought his first match at the National Sporting Club in London, a points decision win over Boss Edwards. That year he also suffered his first defeat in a return bout against Mansfield, losing by points in a ten-round clash.\n\nOn 26 February 1906, Driscoll took the British Featherweight title by defeating Joe Bowker in a 15-round contest at the National Sporting Club. He undertook four more fights before his first defence, which included beating Mansfield by knockout in their fourth meet. His first title defence, held on 3 June 1907, was a copy of his title win, another contest with Bowker at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden. This time it was a twenty-round match and Driscoll stopped his opponent in the seventeenth via a knockout.\n\nThe 24 August 1907 is recorded as a non-contest fight between Driscoll and fellow Welshman Freddie Welsh. Boxing historians such as Andrew Gallimore have cast doubt on this being a professional contest and instead a display fight at a fairground. Welsh supposedly took advantage of this situation and attacked Driscoll with kidney and rabbit punches. Driscoll never forgave his former friend for taking such liberties.\n\nOn 24 February 1908, Driscoll faced New Zealander Charlie Griffin for the vacant Commonwealth Featherweight title. Again fought at Covent Garden, the match went the full fifteen rounds with Driscoll declared champion on a points decision.\n\nAfter claiming the British and Commonwealth featherweight titles Driscoll went to prove himself in the U.S.. American boxing fans of the era favoured all-action boxers, but they were won over by the Cardiffian's skills, giving him the nickname 'Peerless Jim.' (Another common nickname for him was \"Jem,\" and in his home town he was affectionately called \"The Prince of Wales.\") Featherweight champion Abe Attell faced Driscoll in 1910; the Welshman dominated the fight, but with the \"no decision\" rule in place, without a KO he couldn't take the crown. Driscoll declined a rematch in order to attend an exhibition match in aid of the orphans of St. Nazareth House: \"I never break a promise.\" He returned to the United States the next year, but a chest infection and an injury in a road accident sustained just days before meant a poor showing when he faced Pal Moore, losing by newspaper decision. He returned shortly after to Britain, and never got his title shot at Attell.\n\nAfter becoming the first featherweight to win a Lonsdale Belt, Driscoll prepared for an eagerly-anticipated fight against Freddie Welsh. The match was a disappointment, though, as Welsh's spoiling tactics upset Driscoll's style. By the 10th round, Driscoll's frustration boiled over, and he was disqualified for butting Welsh.\n\nDriscoll's boxing career was interrupted by World War I, where he was recruited as a physical training advisor. In succeeding years, he continued to box despite failing health, relying on his skills to keep him out of trouble. When he died in Cardiff of consumption at the age of 44, over 100,000 people lined the streets for his funeral. He is buried at Cathays Cemetery in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nA statue was erected in his honour near the Central Boys' Club, where he trained, in 1997.\n\nDriscoll's final official record is 58-3-6, with 39 KO's, however due to the scoring practices of the time, that yields 6 no-contest bouts on his record. Newspapers used to announce a winner in no-contest bouts, and taking that into account, his true record is 63-4-6 with 39 KO's.\n\nDriscoll bequeathed his Lonsdale Belt to his cousin, Tom Burns, who ran the Royal Oak Hotel in Adamsdown, Cardiff. Today the pub is decorated with Jim Driscoll and other boxing memorabilia.\n\nIn January 2016 an hour long documentary about him, \"Jim Driscoll: Meistr y Sgwâr\" (Jim Driscoll: Master of the Ring), was broadcast on the S4C television channel.\n\n\n\n"}

He played all or part of eleven seasons in Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox (1959–60, 1962–66), Detroit Tigers (1966–70) and San Diego Padres (1970), primarily as a starting pitcher. Wilson batted and threw right-handed; he was born in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, and graduated from Greenville Park High School in Tangipahoa Parish.\n\nIn his eleven-season MLB career, Wilson posted a 121–109 record with 1,452 strikeouts and a 3.69 ERA in 2,051 innings pitched.\n\nWilson began his pro career as a catcher in 1953, but converted to the mound the following year. A , -pound pitcher who relied on sliders and fastballs, Wilson made his Major League debut with the Red Sox on July 28, 1959, as their first black pitcher. Infielder Pumpsie Green had become the first black player on the Red Sox, joining them earlier that season, when Boston was the last of the 16 pre-expansion major league clubs to break the color barrier.\n\nOn June 26, 1962, at Fenway Park, Wilson no-hit the Los Angeles Angels 2-0 and helped his own cause with a home run off Bo Belinsky—himself a no-hit pitcher earlier that year, on May 5. (Wes Ferrell in 1931, Jim Tobin in 1944 and Rick Wise in 1971 are the only three other no-hit pitchers to homer in the same game; the latter of the three hit \"two\" home runs in pitching his no-hitter.) Wilson also became the first black major leaguer to pitch an American League no-hitter.\nIn five-plus seasons, Wilson won 45 games for Boston with a high of 13 victories in 1963. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in the 1966 midseason, and finished with a combined 18-11 record, a career-high in strikeouts with 200, and a 3.07 ERA. His most productive season came in 1967, with a career-high 22 games, tying Jim Lonborg for the American League lead.\n\nIn the 1968 World Series, when the Tigers defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, Wilson was part of a starting rotation which included 31-game winner Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich, who won three games in the Series.\n\nWilson was known as much for his home run power as he was for his pitching. Originally a catcher, Wilson switched to pitching in 1953. According to the \"Elias Sports Bureau\", Wilson hit 35 home runs in his career: 33 as a pitcher, two as a pinch hitter, two in one game (1965), and seven in a season twice, in 740 at-bats. He collected 144 hits for a .195 batting average with 95 runs, 111 RBI and drew 67 bases on balls. Only Wes Ferrell (37 HRs), Bob Lemon and Warren Spahn (35 each) and Red Ruffing (34) hit more home runs as pitchers, according to \"ESB.\"\n\nWilson was sent to the San Diego Padres in 1970, finishing his career at the end of the season. \n\nAfter retiring, he founded an automotive parts company. \n\nWilson also held a position, in the 1980s (and possibly 90s), as a high school physical education teacher and basketball coach at Coral Springs High School in Coral Springs, Florida.\n\nWilson died suddenly as a result of a massive heart attack at his home in Southfield, Michigan, on April 23, 2005, and was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their first two albums were known by only the most die-hard Czech fans, but their break came with the album \"Regeneration?\", which jump-started their rise to domestic fame. \n\nAfter their fourth album \"Tune Da Radio\", the band's lead guitarist and writer Jaromír Helešic left the band, leading to a slight turn away from the Rock genre to a more modern style.\n\nIn May 2013, the group announced a new, as yet unnamed album, due to be released in autumn 2013.\n\nIn May, 2013, the band released a brand new single.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.ahaonline.cz/clanek/musite-vedet/84599/kapela-support-lesbiens-prezila-svuj-rozpad-je-zpatky-v-nove-sestave.html\nhttp://kultura.idnes.cz/support-lesbiens-v-novem-0hm-/hudba.aspx?c=A130312_130315_hudba_vdr\nhttp://www.blesk.cz/clanek/celebrity-ceske-celebrity/192563/support-lesbiens-jsou-zpet-a-vyrazeji-na-turne.html\nhttp://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/218725-nova-deska-nova-sestava-stari-dobri-supporti/\n\n"}
{"id": "1801063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801063", "title": "Bislett Stadium", "text": "Bislett Stadium\n\nBislett Stadium () is a sports stadium in Oslo, Norway. Bislett is Norway's most well known sports arena internationally, with 15 speed skating world records and more than 50 track and field world records having been set here. The original stadium was demolished in 2004 and construction of a new stadium was completed by the summer of 2005. The New Bislett Stadium was designed by C.F. Møller Architects.\n\nBislett Stadium lies on the site of a 19th-century brick works, which was bought by the Municipality of Kristiania (Oslo) in 1898, and turned into a sports field in 1908. The merchant, speed skater, gymnast and sports organizer Martinus Lørdahl was instrumental in facilitating the construction of the first bleachers, begun in 1917 and completed in 1922 along with the new club house. One of the squares outside the stadium is named Martinus Lørdahl's Square, in his honour. Bislett became Norway's main arena for speed skating and track and field in 1940 when the architect Frode Rinnan's new functionalistic stadium was completed, with a capacity of 20,000. Rinnan was also responsible for the renovation of the stadium for the 1952 Winter Olympic Games in Oslo. At those games, the stadium hosted some of the figure skating and the speed skating events. Bislett has hosted the Bislett Games since 1965, an annual track and field event in the IAAF Golden League (from 2010: the Diamond League). The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships 18 times, in 1926–29, 1931–36, 1938–39, 1947, 1949, 1951–52, 1955 and 2006.\n\nBislett's career as a speed skating venue ended in 1988, when it was decided that ice production would discontinue, even though the stadium did not meet international requirements for any other sport. The stadium was quickly becoming run down and even dangerous, but it would take more than decade of debate and at times harsh bickering before the city council decided that Bislett was to be demolished and rebuilt. Especially the matter of whether or not Bislett would continue to host speed skating events provided tensions between the various parties involved, leaving nostalgics bitterly disappointed when it turned out not to be so. Speed skating has increasingly become an indoor sport and providing the famous record breaking ice would no longer be possible if the stadium was to be optimized for athletics and football. The old Bislett was appreciated for its architecture and its atmosphere, not to mention its illustrious record history, and it was perhaps then a fitting gesture that the new stadium was built in record breaking time – construction lasted only ten months. The new stadium designed by Danish architecture practice C. F. Møller Architects was inaugurated with the Bislett Games on 29 July 2005.\n\nThe New Bislett Stadium meets international requirements for track and field events. The running track now has eight lanes with a 37,5 m turning radius (the previous stadium only had six lanes, forcing the Bislett Games organizers to install temporary lanes on the long stretch for the 100 m event). The track has received a 1st class certification by the IAAF, shared by only a handful other stadiums in Northern Europe. In addition, there is an indoor running track beneath the stands for warming up and for indoor workouts during the winter, and the construction of an underground sports hall is under consideration. The new turning radius has provided space for a 105 x 68 m football pitch, and the stadium currently meets national requirements for hosting football matches in the Norwegian Premier League.\n\nThe World Speed Skating Championships were held at Bislett for the first time in 1925, but it was not until 1940 that Bislett became the main venue for speed skating in Oslo. Since then one unofficial World Championship event right before the start of World War II and 11 more official World Championships have been held here, from 1947 to 1983. Bislett has also hosted ten European Championships, with the last one being held in 1986. Norwegian speed skaters Hjalmar Andersen, Knut Johannesen, Fred Anton Maier and Kay Stenshjemmet have all become European Champions at Bislett.\n\nThe largest speed skating event at Bislett was that of the 1952 Olympics. Hjalmar Andersen won three gold medals.\n\nDespite its low-lying altitude, Bislett was on many occasions able to provide ice of a high quality, resulting in ten single distance world records and five overall world records. In 1963, Knut Johannesen broke Boris Shilkov's eight-year-old 5000 m world record from Medeo, with the time 7:37.8. Jonny Nilsson improved the record by around four seconds during the World Championships in 1965. Fred Anton Maier was able to set a 10000 m world record here twice, in 1966 and in 1968. Bislett has seen an additional two 10000 m records, and both times the record was snatched back from Medeo. Sten Stensen set a time of 14:50.31 during the European Championships in 1976. Tomas Gustafson's 14:23.59 from 1982 was Bislett's final speed skating world record.\n\nThe European Championships in 1986 proved to be the last major speed skating event at Bislett, as ice production was halted two years later.\n\nWhen bandy was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics, one match was played at Bislett. \n\nAlso national finals used to be played.\n\nFootball has been played at Bislett since the early days of the sports field, and the first international game was played here in 1913, between Norway and Sweden. At this time there were no bleachers, but the match still drew a crowd of 10,000. The match ended in a 1–1 draw.\n\nBislett was Vålerenga I.F.'s home ground for 55 seasons. The club's attendance record was set here in 1962 and was not beaten until 2004. The club won its first four league championships while playing at Bislett, which earned the nickname \"Leikegrinda\" (\"The playground\"). After years of neglect by the authorities the stadium was in such bad shape that from the middle of the 90s Vålerenga were no longer allowed to play there. After a spell at Ullevaal Stadium the club moved back to Bislett, if only for a short time, and it is unlikely that they will ever return. Vålerenga have played their home matches at Ullevaal since 1999.\n\nAfter the new stadium was completed interest in playing football there on a top level has been mediocre. Both Vålerenga and rivals FK Lyn have been offered to play their home matches there free of charge, but both teams were reluctant to play at what is now primarily a track and field stadium. The stadium is considered to be very intimate for track and field events, but not necessarily for football. Spectators are seated far back from the pitch and due to the stadium's shape half the seats are located at the ends of the pitch. The main stand does not have a permanent roof and of the 15,400 capacity only 3,000 seats are covered. Lyn was the last team to reject a deal with the municipality over Bislett, in 2005, and instead they continued to play at Ullevaal, their home ground for the past 80 years. After several years of financial troubles, Lyn finally accepted an offer to play at Bislett in 2010, but ultimately declared bankruptcy during the season, resigned from the Norwegian league, and were liquidated shortly thereafter.\n\nAlthough the two top teams in Oslo have declined to use Bislett as their home ground they have still shown some interest in playing there during the winter, in the Scandinavian club tournament known as Royal League. In addition, the 1st division (second level in the Norwegian pyramid) club Manglerud Star Oslo played their home games here in the 2006 season, before being relegated to the 2nd division. In 2007 it became the home ground of Skeid, promoted back to the 1st division after one season in the 2nd division, their ground at Voldsløkka not being up to standards for 1st division play. Although Skeld were relegated back to the 2nd division after the 2009 season, they still use Bislett as their home ground.\n\nThe Norway national rugby union team occasionally plays their matches at the stadium.\n\nThe final of the rugby league Nordic Cup between Scandinavian nations was played at the stadium, between Norway and Denmark in August 2012.\n\n"}

He is one of the 14 grandsons of Francesc Cambó.\n\nHe started his professional career in the academic and legal research at the University of Navarra, specialising in Private International Law. In 1992 he moved back to Barcelona and started teaching at its then main Law School (Facultat de Dret, Universitat de Barcelona). A few years later he joined a law firm as senior associate lawyer, and for some years he mixed his legal practice with the first steps in a political career. In 1995 he was elected to the Catalan Parliament. But after a few months, in March 2004 he run as candidate for the Spanish Parliament, or Congreso delos Diputados, where he would seat for two consecutive terms, 1996-2000 and 2000-2004. He assumed different responsibilities, mostly in the areas of Foreign Affairs, Culture, and Justice & Legal Affairs. During the same period he joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and its Committee for Legal Affairs and Human Rights. His tasks included the screening of candidates to Judges of the European Court of Human Rights. In 2004 he ran as candidate for the European Parliament, heading a joined candidacy of the main parties from Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia called .\nAs a Member of the European Parliament he joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), and he assumed different activities and responsibilities in particular in the areas of Culture and Media (CULT), Justice & Home Affairs (LIBE), and International Trade (INTA), where he was the Committee's Vice Chair. He was an active member of the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue as well of the Delegation for the South Eastern Balkans. He took part as Observer in several international Elections’ Observation missions, including Russia, Palestine, Serbia & Montenegro, and East Timor. Anecdotically, Ignasi Guardans was in Mumbai during the 26 November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, as the Head of a 36 strong European Parliament Delegation. He was not injured.\n\nIn 2009, following a strong disagreement with the leadership of his party on the status of Catalonia within Spain, and rejecting to assume Catalonia's full independence as a political goal, he lost the confidence of his party to be promoted again as candidate to the EP. In a surprising decision, a few weeks before the end of the Parliament's Term, he was designated by the Spanish Government as Director General of Spain’s Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las Artes Audiovisuales (ICAA), the Spanish Film Agency. This indirectly included other national and international responsibilities, such as the Presidency of the finance company Audiovisual SGR (today CREA SGR); or the active Membership of the EFADs in Europe, or the Conference of Latin American Film Authorities or CAACI in Latin America. Following discrepancies with the then Minister of Culture, Ángeles González-Sinde his mandate was called to an end in early December 2010.\n\nIn 2011 he was appointed the first Director for Public Affairs & Member Relations at the European Broadcasting Union (EBU-UER). Among his tasks he was charged with the management of a Solidarity Program in support of Mediterranean Broadcasters during the Arab Spring. Guardans later moved to Brussels as an independent consultant. Between 2014 and 2014 he channeled his consulting activities in European Public Affairs (mostly in the areas of trade and digital regulation and policy) as a Partner of a global law firm, K&L Gates LLP in its Brussels Office. Among other tasks, he acted as Director in Europe for the TransAtlantic Business Council (TABC), as the European counterpart to his then colleague former Congressman Bart Gordon. In parallel, through CUMEDIAE, a non-profit organization specialized in advice and project management in the field of media and the creative sector he co-founded, he has been involved in a number of projects and consulting activities for the arts and for culture and development in different areas such as Film Literacy, gender equality in the media in the South Mediterranean or the best identification of cultural indicators. \n\nPolitically, Guardans terminated any party membership in 2010 when he left Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC), a party he had joined in 1992, when its leadership still played a constructive role in Spain and in full respect of the Spanish Constitution. Ignasi Guardans has remained a politically independent figure afterwards, but has attracted some controversy among part of his former political constituency as he opposes the claim for Catalan independence and many of his former political colleagues have moved towards direct opposition to the current Spanish Constitutional order.\n\nIn the media, Guardans has had a regular presence for many years: for 12 years he was a weekly analyst at the radio talkshow La Ventana; for several years he contributed to the public broadcaster morning show ; and since 2017 he comments live on a weekly basis at El Gabinete (Onda Cero) and at (Cadena Ser). He has been a regular Op-Ed contributor to newspapers such as La Vanguardia, El País and El Periódico de Catalunya.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Preston (1840–1865).\n\n\"Preston\" was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Shipbuilding Division, San Pedro, California, 13 June 1943; launched 12 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. R. F. Gross; and commissioned 20 March 1944, Commander G. S. Patrick in command.\n\nFollowing shakedown off California and extended exercises in Hawaiian waters, \"Preston\" departed Pearl Harbor, for the Marianas combat zone, 1 July 1944. On the 17th, she arrived off Guam and until 8 August screened the transport areas off the assault beaches. Two days in Apra harbor followed, after which she got underway for Eniwetok. On 29 August, she joined Task Force 38 (TF 38) and sailed west. Between 6 and 8 September, she screened the aircraft carriers during strikes against the Palaus; then, continuing on, guarded them during sorties against Japanese positions in the south and central Philippines. On completing runs on the 14th, she returned with the force to the Palaus to cover the landings on Peleliu and Anguar, then sailed back to the Philippines before retiring to Ulithi.\n\nOn 6 October, the force again sortied—this time to launch strikes preparatory to the invasion of the Philippines. After hitting the enemy's Formosan air bases, the force turned southeast for operations off Luzon in support of the Leyte landings. On 24 October, as the Japanese initiated a triple-pronged thrust to drive the Allied forces from Leyte Gulf, \"Preston\"'s group, Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3), came under severe attack in what was to be the first of the battles for Leyte Gulf. Wave after wave of bomber and torpedo planes closed the formation. Many were shot down, but \"Princeton\" (CVL-23) was lost. That evening TG 38.3 was ordered north to rendezvous with TG 38.2 and TG 38.4 and search for a Japanese carrier force. Within an hour of the midnight rendezvous search planes were flying. After daylight they caught the enemy force north of Cape Engaño and the fighting squadrons were sent off. In the afternoon the force's cruiser-destroyer group closed the surviving ships to deliver final blows. The force then retired to the south to join in the search for enemy vessels fleeing through San Bernardino Strait. On 27 October, sorties were flown to provide air cover for ground forces on Leyte after which the ships got underway for Ulithi.\n\nBy 5 November \"Preston\" was back in the operating area off Luzon as strikes were flown against enemy installations there. Anti-Japanese shipping runs in the central Philippines, particularly the Ormoc Bay area, followed and on 12 November the hammering of Luzon was resumed and repeated again on 25 November to 2 December and 10 to 21 December. On 30 December the force again steamed northwest from Ulithi, and after welcoming the new year, 1945, with raids on Formosa and the Nansei Shoto, supported the Lingayen assault. Then, passing through the Bashi Channel, the ships entered the South China Sea and blasted Japanese shipping and shore installations along the Indo-China coast. By 15 January they were off western Formosa and by the 19th had swung around to launch strikes against that island and Okinawa Gunto from the east. During February, \"Preston\" screened the carriers as their planes delivered devastating blows to industrial complexes on the Japanese home islands; provided air support for the assault troops on Iwo Jima; returned to Japan for further strikes on Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe; and then sailed south for renewed raids against the next amphibious target, Okinawa.\n\n\"Preston\" returned to Ulithi, where she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa. Her group sailed for the Ryukyus, 21 March, to screen the bombardment and underwater demolition groups. Between 24 March and 1 April she operated off Kerama Retto, then shifted to fire support off the Hagushi beaches. Continuing fire support duty until June, she provided assistance for elements of the Tenth Armythe unique cross-branch force consisting of divisions of the US Army and the US Marine CorpsArmy and Marine Corpsduring their assault on the Motobu Peninsula, where her fire enabled Marines to break out of their Japanese-ringed position; in the Nago Wan, Nakagusuku Wan, and Naha areas; and on Ie Shima and Kutaka Shima. In early June, she conducted patrols against suicide boats, then returned to fire support activities. In July, she patrolled off northern Okinawa on radar picket duty and, in August, escorted convoys in and out of the Buckner Bay area.\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender, 14 August, \"Preston\" remained in the Okinawa area on air-sea rescue duty. On 6 September, she got underway for the United States, arriving at San Pedro, California on 24 September to begin inactivation. In November she shifted to San Diego where she decommissioned 24 April 1946 and was berthed as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.\n\nReactivated following the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, \"Preston\" recommissioned 26 January 1951 and in April got underway for the east coast. Modernization at Philadelphia preceded a brief stay at her homeport of Newport. The ship lost one 5\"/38 mount (#3) which was replaced by a new gun director. Other major changes in armaments, radars and other capabilities were made at this time. On 9 January 1952, she sailed eastward on her Mediterranean deployment. Returning from 6th Fleet duty in May, she participated in fleet and type training from Labrador to the Caribbean.\n\nOn 1 April 1953, she departed the New England coast for the Pacific and a return to combat in the Far East. Arriving in Japan in early May, she operated with the fast carrier force, TF 77, until June, then joined the UN Blockade and Escort Force, TF 95. With the signing of the truce 27 July, \"Preston\" got underway for Newport and, steaming via Suez, completed the round-the-world cruise, at Boston, in October. Overhaul followed and between May and September 1954 she operated with HUK (Hunter Killer) units of the Atlantic Fleet. In 1955 another Mediterranean deployment was followed by antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and on 15 March 1956, she cleared Narragansett Bay and headed back to the west coast.\n\nAssigned to Destroyer Squadron 23 (DesRon 23), \"Preston\" arrived at Long Beach 15 April and through May operated off the California coast. In June, she sailed west for her first peacetime Far East deployment and initiated a schedule of regular rotation between tours with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific and 1st Fleet assignments; the former including SEATO and other Allied exercises and Taiwan patrol duty, and the latter including west coast training and cruises to the Arctic and to the central Pacific. In December 1958, \"Preston\" assisted the fire-ravaged Japanese town of Keniya by providing food and clothing. During 1962 she followed winter arctic operations with participation in nuclear tests in the milder climes of the Pacific. In March 1964 \"Preston\" deployed to the WestPac operational area with the 7th Fleet . Most of her time was spent in the South China Sea with brief visits to Japan. Joining TG 77.6 in late July she first went to Hong Kong and then left to the Tonkin Gulf following the first attack on the \"Maddox\" DD-731 on 2 August. The Carrier Task Group was led by \"Constellation\" CVA-64, which participated in the first counterattacks against North Vietnam. This action resulted in a Presidential Unit Commendation. Then in 1965 she deployed for the second time to the Vietnam combat area. Joining TG 77.5 on 12 August, she performed plane guard and screening duties for the carriers \"Coral Sea\" (CV-43) and \"Ticonderoga\" (CV-14), and provided gunfire support to ground troops until late 1968.\n\n\"Preston\" was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 15 November 1969.\n\n\"Preston\" earned 6 battle stars during World War II and one during the Korean War. Presidential Unit Commendation awarded August 1964 for Tonkin Gulf action.\n\n\"Preston\" was transferred to Turkey 15 November 1969, and renamed TCG \"İçel\" (D 344).\n\n\"Icel\" was stricken and broken up for scrap in 1981.\n\n\n"}

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, also known as Plant Vogtle (), is a 2 unit nuclear power plant located in Burke County, near Waynesboro, Georgia, in the southeastern United States. It is named after a former Alabama Power and Southern Company board chairman, Alvin Vogtle.\n\nEach unit has a Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR), with a General Electric steam turbine and electric generator. \nUnits 1 and 2 were completed in 1987 and 1989, respectively. \nEach unit has a gross electricity generation capacity of 1,215 MW, for a combined capacity of 2,430 MW. \nThe twin natural-draft cooling towers are tall and provide cooling to the plant's main condensers. \nFour smaller mechanical draft cooling towers provide nuclear service cooling water (NSCW) to safety and auxiliary non-safety components, as well as remove the decay heat from the reactor when the plant is offline. \nOne natural-draft tower and two NSCW towers serve each unit. \nIn 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) renewed the licenses for both units for an additional 20 years to 1/16/2047 for Unit 1, and 2/9/2049 for Unit 2. During Vogtle's first two units construction, capital investment required jumped from an estimated $660 million to $8.87 billion. ($ in dollars)\n\nTwo additional units utilizing Westinghouse AP1000 reactors are under construction. \nNatural-draft type cooling towers were also selected, and the two new cooling towers are nearly tall. \nThe units have suffered several delays and cost overruns. \nThe certified construction & capital costs incurred by Georgia Power for these two new units were originally $14 billion, according to the Seventeenth Semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in 2017.\nThis last report blames the latest increase of costs on the contractor not completing work as scheduled. \nAnother complicating factor in the construction process is the bankruptcy of Westinghouse in 2017.\nIn 2018 costs were estimated to be about $25 billion.\nUpon completion of Units 3 and 4 in 2021, Vogtle will become the largest nuclear power station in the United States.\n\nThe Vogtle Electric Generating Plant has two operational reactors with two additional units under construction.\nIn 2008, both reactors were increased in power by 1.7% by an \"Appendix K\" uprate, also called a Measurement Uncertainty Recapture (MUR) uprate. Measurement uncertainty recapture power uprates are less than 2 percent, and are achieved by implementing enhanced techniques for calculating reactor power. This involves the use of state-of-the-art feedwater flow measurement devices to more precisely measure feedwater flow, which is used to calculate reactor power. More precise measurements reduce the degree of uncertainty in the power level, which is used by analysts to predict the ability of the reactor to be safely shut down under postulated accident conditions. Because the reactor power can now be calculated with much greater accuracy than with the old venturi type measurement, the plant can safely run within a tighter margin of error to its limits. The new flowmeter works by comparing the time it takes ultrasonic sound pulses to travel upstream versus downstream inside the pipe, and uses the time differential to figure the flow rate of the water in the pipe.\n\nThe NRC approved Vogtle's License Amendment Request (LAR) in March 2008. The NRC staff determined that Southern Nuclear could safely increase the reactor's power output primarily through more accurate means of measuring feedwater flow. NRC staff also reviewed Southern Nuclear's evaluations showing that the plant's design can handle the increased power level. Unit 1 was uprated during its Spring 2008 refueling outage, and Unit 2 was uprated in the Fall outage of the same year.\n\nA loss of electrical power in the plant occurred on March 20, 1990.\n\nAt 9:20 a.m., a truck carrying fuel and lubricants in the plant's 230kV switchyard backed into a support column for the feeder line supplying power to the Unit 1-A reserve auxiliary transformer (RAT). At the time, the 1-B RAT was de-energized for maintenance and RAT 1-A was powering both trains of emergency electrical power. The non-emergency electrical trains were being powered by back-feeding from the switchyard through the main step-up transformer to the 1-A and 1-B unit auxiliary transformers (UAT). Additionally, emergency diesel generator (EDG) 1-B was out of service for planned maintenance. After the power loss, EDG 1-A failed to start due to a protective safety trip. The resulting loss of electrical power in the plant's \"vital circuits\" shut down the residual heat removal (RHR) pump that was cooling the core of Unit 1 (which was nearing the end of a refueling outage) and prevented the backup RHR from activating. Even though Unit 1 was offline at the time, residual heat from the natural decay of the radioactive fuel must be removed to prevent a dangerous rise in core temperature. While the non-safety power was not interrupted, there was no physical connection between the vital and non-vital electrical trains, preventing the vital trains from receiving power from the unaffected path through the UATs.\n\nAt 9:40 a.m., the plant operators declared a site area emergency (SAE) per existing procedures which called for an SAE whenever \"vital\" power is lost for more than 15 minutes. At 9:56 a.m., after trying multiple times to start the 1-A EDG normally, plant operators performed an emergency startup of the EDG by activating the generator's emergency start \"break-glass\" which bypassed most of the EDG's safeties and forced it to start. The startup was successful. RHR-A was then started using power from EDG-A. With core cooling restored, the SAE was downgraded to an alert at 10:15 a.m. At 11:40 a.m., crews energized RAT 1-B which had been shut down for maintenance, restoring power to the \"B\" safety electrical train. At 12:57 p.m., the \"A\" safety train was switched from the EDG to RAT 1-B and the EDG was shut down. With both trains receiving offsite power, the alert was terminated at 1:47 p.m.\n\nThe temperature of the Unit 1 core coolant increased from to during the 36 minutes required to re-energize the A-side bus. Throughout the event, non-vital power was continuously available to Unit 1 from off-site sources. However, the Vogtle electrical system was not designed to permit easy interconnection of the Unit 1 vital busses to non-vital power or the Unit 2 electrical busses. Since this incident, Plant Vogtle has implemented changes to the plant that allow the non-vital electrical buses to transfer power to the vital buses in this type of scenario.\n\nThis electrical fault also affected Unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kV switchyard to trip, cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus \"B.\" EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored power to the vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on the Unit 2 main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated, opening the transformer's output breaker. This caused a full load rejection to Unit 2, leading to a turbine trip and subsequently, a reactor scram. After Unit 2 tripped, the \"B\" non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B, causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip. Despite this, plant cool-down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital \"B\" electrical trains, allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused Unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the Unit 2 would have remained online.\n\nOn August 15, 2006, Southern Nuclear formally applied for an Early Site Permit (ESP) for two additional units. \nThe ESP determined whether the site was appropriate for additional reactors, and this process is separate from the Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) application process. \nOn March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear announced that it had submitted an application for a COL, a process which would take at least 3 to 4 years. \nOn April 9, 2008, Georgia Power Company reached a contract agreement for two AP1000 reactors designed by Westinghouse; owned by Toshiba. \nWestinghouse partnered with the Shaw Group (Baton Rouge, LA) and its Stone & Webster division to manage the project with Westinghouse responsible for engineering, design, and overall management, and Shaw responsible for manufacturing the pre-fabricated component modules and managing the on-site construction. \nThe contract represented the first agreement for new nuclear development in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, and it received approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission on March 17, 2009.\n\nOn August 26, 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an Early Site Permit and a Limited Work Authorization. \nLimited construction at the new reactor sites began, with Unit 3 then expected to be operational in 2016, followed by Unit 4 in 2017, pending final issuance of the Combined Construction and Operating License by the NRC. \nThese dates have since slipped to 2021 and 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, President Barack Obama announced $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees toward the construction cost, although as of December 2013, Georgia Power had not availed itself of those guarantees, at first awaiting the construction license, and after the construction stop lawsuit outcome.\nThe expected building cost for the two reactors was $14 billion. \nGeorgia power's share was around $6.1 billion, while remaining ownership of the two reactors is split among Oglethorpe Power Corp., the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), and Dalton Utilities.\n\nIn February 2012, the NRC approved the construction license of the two proposed AP1000 reactors at Vogtle. NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build and operate the two new nuclear power reactors, citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying, \"I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened.\" One week after Southern Company received the license to begin construction, many environmental and anti-nuclear groups sued to stop the expansion project, claiming \"public safety and environmental problems since Japan's Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account\". On July 11, 2012, the lawsuit was rejected by the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIn February 2013, the project's construction contractor, Shaw, was purchased by Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CB&I). On March 12, 2013, construction on Unit 3 officially began with the pour of the basemat concrete for the nuclear island. This operation was completed on March 14. During the weekend of June 1, 2013, assembly of the containment vessel began with the bottom head of the vessel being lifted into place on the nuclear island. By June 2013, the construction schedule had been extended by at least 14 months. On November 21, 2013, the basemat pour for Unit 4 was completed.\n\nIn February 2014, the Department of Energy approved a $6.5 billion loan guarantee for Southern Company subsidiary Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power Corp. The Department of Energy initially demanded a credit subsidy fee, but the demand was ultimately dropped given the financial strength of Southern Co. and the Vogtle project.\n\nFurther delays and cost increases were incorporated in a revised schedule in early 2015. As a result of the increased delays and cost overruns, contractor CB&I exited the project and Westinghouse took direct control of the project as contractor and hired construction firm Fluor to replace CB&I/Shaw on-site managing the day-to-day work. Westinghouse purchased certain assets of the former Shaw Group from CB&I to allow the project to go forward. In 2016, Southern Company and Westinghouse added construction firm Bechtel to the project to share construction management responsibilities.\n\nRecent construction milestones include setting the final of the \"big six\" structural modules for Unit 3 (CA-02 and CA-03, which form the walls of a storage tank that is part of the reactor's passive cooling system). The \"big six\" modules also include the previously installed CA-01, CA-04, and CA-05 in-containment structural modules, as well as the previously installed CA-20 structural module which forms part of the internal structure of the auxiliary building, containing many of the reactor's support systems. CA-02 and CA-03 were placed within the containment vessel in May 2016. The setting of these modules is a fairly significant milestone and allows other construction activities to commence. In June 2016, the final reactor coolant pump for Unit 3 was received on site. In November 2016, the reactor vessel for Unit 3 was set within the nuclear island. 2017 progress includes the installation of the reactor coolant loop piping and both steam generators at Unit 3. Progress has also been made in the turbine, auxiliary, and annex building. Unit 4 has also seen progress with the installation of the final two \"big six\" structural modules. Construction of both cooling towers is complete, with each nearly tall.\n\nIn March 2017, Westinghouse Electric Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects. The U.S. government has given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees to help finance construction of the Vogtle reactors, and a way forward to completing the plant has been agreed upon. On July 31, 2017 Southern Company division, Southern Nuclear, officially took over construction from Westinghouse and opened a bid for a new construction management contract to manage the day-to-day work on the site. Southern received bids from both Fluor and Bechtel. On August 31, 2017, Southern announced its decision to move forward with Bechtel to be the day-to-day construction manager for the remainder of the project. Bechtel will replace Fluor, who will no longer be involved in the project.\n\nIn November 2017 the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) requested additional documentation following concerns that design blueprints had not been approved by appropriately licensed engineers, which has legal implications. On December 21, 2017, the PSC approved the continuation of construction on Units 3 and 4, with conditions that reduced the costs that can be recovered from ratepayers over the life of the project.\n\nIn the February 2018 Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report (VCM), GPSC approved November 2021 and November 2022 as the target in-service dates for Units 3 & 4 respectively. The report notes that the project is being completed on an accelerated schedule and is currently tracking ahead of the 2021 & 2022 in-service target dates.\n\nIn August 2018 a $2.3 billion increase in costs was recognised. The total cost, including financing costs, is estimated at about $25 billion.\nIn September 2018, in order to sustain the project, Georgia Power agreed to pay an additional proportion of the costs of the smaller project partners if the cost of completion went beyond $9.2 billion.\n\nIn March 2019 further federal loan guarantees of $3.7 billion were given to the various build partners, taking total federal loan guarantees up to $12 billion. The Georgia Power CEO said the loan guarantees played a key role in reducing financing costs for the build. Also in March 2019, Georgia Power confirmed that the Unit 3 containment cap had been lowered into place and the reactor would be ready to load nuclear fuel in 2020. This was preceded by the containment vessel third ring, as well as reactor coolant pump and polar crane installation in unit 3 during 2018 and 2019. The containment vessel top head was set during a site visit by Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and executives of the plant's owners. Recent progress on unit 4 includes the installation of the final steam generator and pressurizer. Unit 4 is being constructed utilizing lessons learned from Unit 3 and from the failed Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station (V.C. Summer) project and as a result the order in which some components are being installed has been modified. On November 22, 2019 the third ring of the containment vessel was set for unit 4, and on December 8, 2019 the unit 3 shield building roof was set above the unit 3 containment vessel. On December 16, 2019 the control room of unit 3 became operational and is now available for testing systems. On February 11, 2020, Southern Nuclear announced that the final concrete placement inside the Unit 3 containment vessel was completed which will allow installation of the reactor's fueling machine. As of February 2020, assembly continues on the final top most vertical feature of the overall Unit 3 reactor building, the passive containment cooling system storage tank, which will be set on top of the Shield Building Roof.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Vogtle was 5,845, a decrease of 16.3 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 726,640, an increase of 8.8 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Augusta, GA (26 miles to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to either reactor at Vogtle was 1 in 140,845, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1801110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801110", "title": "Hastings Ranch, Pasadena, California", "text": "Hastings Ranch, Pasadena, California\n\nHastings Ranch is a neighborhood of Pasadena, California which lies in northeast Pasadena. It is principally accessed by Sierra Madre Boulevard, Michillinda Avenue, Hastings Ranch Blvd., and Riviera Drive. Hastings Ranch is also identified by large shopping areas at its southernmost end and by a shopping center at the corner of Sierra Madre and Michillinda. Hastings Ranch is divided by Sierra Madre Blvd, north of the blvd is Upper Hastings Ranch and south is Lower Hastings Ranch. To the north of the Ranch is the San Gabriel Mountains and Mount Wilson.\n\nIn 1882, Charles Cook Hastings purchased of land between Pasadena and Sierra Madre for US$7 per acre. He named his ranch \"Mesa Alta Rancho\" and began planting with grape vines and constructed a mansion. Soon after he died, his son, Charles Houston Hastings, assumed responsibility for the land. He imported unusual specimens of plants and trees and populated the ranch with peacocks, pheasants, cats, dogs (32 collies) and champion horses. In 1928, the Hastings mansion caught fire and burned to the ground. The ranch fell into a state of disrepair and its operation was left to managers.\n\nHastings Ranch was one of several competing sites for the University of California's southern campus, but lost to UCLA in 1919.\n\nThe Sierra Airdrome was an air strip at Sierra Madre Villa Avenue and Foothill Boulevard built in 1920 by the Sierra Aircraft Company of Pasadena. Currently its location is occupied by a shopping center featuring Best Buy and Sears. The airport was also known as \"Sierra Flying Field,” “Eliel Field,” and “Hastings Airport.” The Sierra Aircraft Company of Pasadena was owned by Leon T. Eliel, a former Air Force lieutenant and World War I aviator, and Walter Wright Alley, an airplane technician. Along with air and mail travel, there was aerial surveys, an Eliel patented an aerial photography camera. Small planes were built at the airport also. The airport was triangular shape, with the side dimensions of 1,800 x 2,000 x 2,700 feet. Amelia Earhart flew from the airport in an air rodeo in 1924. World War I flying ace, Bogart Rogers, also flew from the airport. The Sierra Airdrome closed in 1929.\n\nFollowing the death of Charles Houston Hastings in 1942, the ranch was sold by the Hastings Foundation to a syndicate for over $1 million. The land was subdivided into luxury housing tracts. Hired by Coronet Construction Co. / Coronet Homes, Inc. in the late 1940s, Edward H. Fickett, FAIA was brought in to design the three subdivided tracts. The construction was completed in three phases, including 600 homes in the Lower Hastings tract completed in 1950, 480 homes in the Middle Hastings tract completed in 1950, along with 800 homes Fickett built in 1951 in the Upper Hastings Ranch area.\n\nHastings Ranch Shopping Center, located on the north side of Foothill Boulevard Between Rosemead Boulevard and Michillinda Avenue, opened in 1960 with an expansion in 1984. It is home to Sears, Marshalls, Whole Foods Market, CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid Pharmacy and Vromans Bookstore. \n\nWith the post war growth of the 1950s, a drive-in theater was established at the lowest point of the neighborhood between Rosemead and Foothill Boulevards by the name of Hastings Drive-In Theater. It fell to heavy commercial development in the 1960s. The drive-in was replaced by the \"Hastings Theater,\" which opened in 1968. The theater was a part of the Pacific Theatres chain, until it closed in 2008, and was replaced by LA Fitness. Mann Theaters opened a competing three-screen movie theater in Hastings Ranch in March, 1975 (premiering with The Towering Inferno), which closed in 2002 to be replaced by Trader Joe's. \n\nToday Hastings Ranch is defined locally as two independent neighborhoods: \"Upper Hastings\" and \"Lower Hastings,\" with Sierra Madre Villa Boulevard dividing the two.\n\nThe Lariat is the bimonthly newsletter published for the residents of Upper Hastings Ranch. The newsletter contains information about the neighborhood, as well as publicizing essays by young residents.\n\nFilms made in the Hastings Ranch area include 1978's The Jerk with Steve Martin (the gas station scene was filmed on the southwest corner of Greenhill Avenue and Rosemead Boulevard, now a Carl's Jr. fast food restaurant). A once-popular BMX track in a vacant lot next to Field Elementary School, frequented by neighborhood children (including the Van Halen brothers), was leveled in 1976 to make room for the \"Sunrise Campus\" of \"First Church of the Nazarene.\" The complex was completed in 1985.\n\nHastings Ranch is home to Don Benito Elementary School, Pasadena's magnet elementary school, and Field Elementary School. The neighborhood is also served by Wilson Middle School and Pasadena High School. La Salle High School is a private school in the area.\n\nHastings Ranch is part of the Pasadena City Council's Fourth District, represented by Gene Masuda.\n\nUpper Hastings Ranch has become one of the most popular areas for neighborhood outdoor Christmas displays. The practice began in 1957 whereby each block in the neighborhood would decorate their homes with some type of theme icon placed in the parkway, e.g., snowmen, Christmas trees, Santas and reindeer, Peanuts cartoon characters, etc. The tour which was taken by automobile would consist of miles of lighting and other entertaining Christmas scenarios displayed about the labyrinth of homes.\n\nThe Hastings Ranch Christmas display took its place among the popular local venues of Christmas Tree Lane and the Balian Mansion, both in Altadena.\n\nThe original concept of the Upper Hastings Ranch Christmas Light Parade ('Parading' up and down the streets of Upper Hastings as a real estate gimmick was the basis for the idea) was the brainchild of William M. Lawson, (not to be confused with the \"Bill Lawson\" associated with The Pasadena Rose Parade) a well-loved and colorful local Realtor and long time resident of both Upper Hastings (1220 Rexford Avenue) and Lower Hastings (3750 Shadow Grove Road) until his death on January 3, 2004. Lawson's idea was to attract attention to Coronet Homes where he made his real estate career thrive through the Christmas Light Parade and through his ingenious use of aerial photography to promote the area. The aerial photographs were transferred onto Postcards and mailed throughout the Southern California area, and as far away as New York State and there was even a Christmas issue letting people know of the annual upcoming Christmas Light Parade. As a result of \"Captain Billy('s)\" efforts [a moniker later attributed to him as a result of his turning his Lower Hastings Ranch home on Shadow Grove Road into the somewhat infamous \"Pasadena Maritime Museum\" [infamous because of his legendary almost nightly partying during the 27 years between his second and third marriages] and for his service as a Naval Bombardier during WW2] Lawson sold over 800 homes in Upper and Lower Hastings Ranch, setting records as one of the highest producing Realtors' of the era. Originally, when the Christmas Light Display was conceived, Lawson assembled 'Block Captains\" who would oversee the decorating of each home on their respective streets. So popular was Lawson's idea that even the Jewish population of Upper Hastings joined in the decorating frenzy as they quickly realized that the celebration was not necessarily of the Christmas holiday, but of the time of year which also included Chanukah. Lawson's magic was evidenced by his ability to: \"make Coronet Homes truly special regardless of race, creed or color, religious persuasion or profession\". Of course, to the chagrin of many a covering reporter it was hard to miss the \"FOR SALE\" signs, while touring Coronet homes during the parade! Homes for sale was a common situation as Upper Hastings Ranch during that period (the late 1950s through the 1969 Moon Landing was the pinnacle of the Space Race) and Upper Hastings boasted more nearby Jet Propulsion Laboratory Engineers and Caltech Professors as residents than any other neighborhood in Southern California. In fact, the average tenure of a JPL engineer was 8 months which accounted for the high turnover in Coronet Homes a fact not lost on Lawson. The idea garnered widespread attention by just about every local and regional newspaper, radio and television station - traditions which continue to this day. Many believe that this was one of, if not Southern California's, first organized Christmas Light displays of scale and shortly thereafter, another local Realtor named Howard B. Lawson [William's Uncle and ultimately Commodore of the Newport Harbor Yacht Club in Newport Beach] revitalized another Christmas Light Display, which has evolved in the Newport Harbor Festival of Lights Boat Parade. Ask a local and they will likely tell you how growing up in Pasadena required the annual piling in the family station wagon to trek up and down the streets of the Coronet Tract in Upper Hastings to see the lights and the unique, theme-oriented decorations.

The meaning of the title is unclear. Even Springsteen himself says in the \"Born to Run\" documentary \"Wings for Wheels: The Making of Born to Run\": \"I still have no idea what it means. But it's important.\"\n\nThe song's protagonist, \"Bad Scooter\", is a pseudonym for Springsteen himself (as indicated by the initials they share). In the third verse, \"Big Man joined the band\" refers to the now deceased Clarence Clemons, the band's long-time saxophonist.\n\nAs stated by Springsteen in the \"Wings for Wheels\" documentary, the idea for the composition of the horn intro was Steven Van Zandt's. Despite all of this, the single was a chart dud, getting no higher than #83 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. However, it has always had a strong following on album-oriented rock radio and amongst Springsteen's fan base.\n\n\n\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" has become a staple of Springsteen's E Street Band concert tours, with regular appearances from the 1975 and on the Born to Run tours through the 1984 legs of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, with one of the latter documented on the later \"Live/1975–85\", and the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express. It then returned with a featured regular spot on the 1999–2000 Reunion Tour, often used as an introduction of the band. An extended 20-minute version was captured on the subsequent \"\" release, and was frequently played during most of the legs of the 2007–2008 Magic Tour and during the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. It opened the four-song set at Springsteen and the band's high-profile half-time appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, which included Springsteen pointing out that the verse about \"the Big Man\" joining the band was the important part of the song.\n\nA slower version of this song was played during the Born to Run tours, on December 31, 1975 in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter Clemons' death, Springsteen used the song as a memorial/tribute to both him and the late Danny Federici on the Wrecking Ball Tour, the first E Street Band tour without Clemons. During the song's third verse of \"Big Man joined the band\", Springsteen paused the song where Clemons' sax solo would traditionally be performed while a video of Clemons and Federici played on the stage screens. On the High Hopes and River 2016 tours, Springsteen removed the pause from performances of the song, but kept the video tribute.\n\nSpringsteen joined his longtime friend Billy Joel on stage at Madison Square Garden on July 18, 2018 to perform the song (along with \"Born to Run\") for Joel's 100th appearance at MSG.\n\n"}
