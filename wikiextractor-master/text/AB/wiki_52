{"id": "1979855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979855", "title": "Bamboo Union", "text": "Bamboo Union\n\nThe United Bamboo Gang (UBG; ; Bamboo Union triad) is the largest of Taiwan's three main criminal Triads. They are reported to have roughly 10,000 members. The membership consists largely of \"waishengren\" (Mainland Chinese) and has had historic ties to the Kuomintang; they are said to be motivated as much by political ideology as by profit. They are known to simply call themselves \"businessmen\", but in reality, are also involved in organized killings and drug trafficking. The gang gained global notoriety when it became directly involved in politics in the early 1980s. The union does not view themselves as criminals, but instead they view themselves as patriots.\n\nThe Bamboo Union was formed in the 1950s by Waishengren (\"mainland Chinese\") children who wanted to protect themselves from threats by Hoklo children. The first members lived on Bamboo Forest Road in Jung Ho City, Taipei County, now Zhonghe District of New Taipei City. Its first members were made up of mainland Chinese teens who joined together to secure a place in the country of Taiwan after 1949. The mainland Chinese were regarded as an unwelcome minority that was rejected by Hoklo citizens following the end of the Chinese Civil War, when the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan. Although the Nationalist Republic of China government continued to hold claims on mainland China after 1949, the mainland was controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and Taiwan was controlled by the KMT. The Bamboo Union criminal gang began primarily with street-fighting to gain recognition in society.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the aspirations of the Bamboo Union membership shifted from street-fighting to profiteering. The gang began making a name for itself in the \"protection\" business and extorting money from local shops and factories, but the gang's treasury overflowed when thousands of well-paid American GIs flocked to Taipei while on R&R from the Vietnam War. Chinese nightclub owners welcomed Bamboo Union members to their premises to banish rival gangs of ethnic Taiwanese trying to carve out a share of the lucrative trade in gambling, prostitution, and drugs. By this stage, the Bamboo Union was fast developing into a transnational crime syndicate or \"triad\". For example, leader Chang An-lo, nicknamed \"White Wolf,\" moved to Las Vegas in 1968 to study and keep order of the Bamboo Union's expanding empire, particularly in the Chinatowns of California and the gambling halls of Las Vegas.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the gang became even more powerful when they joined hands with the \"Iron Blood Patriots\" to carry out missions overseas. In return, both gangs were offered a great share of the heroin trade that expanded into the world market. This deal made the Bamboo Union very powerful in Taiwanese politics and social culture, but they were also being watched by major countries like the United States. The gang's powerful relationship with the \"Iron Blood Patriots\" came to an end after journalist Henry Liu was murdered on 15 October 1984.\n\nIn 1980, the daughters and mother of one of the leading members of the opposition, Lin Yi-hsiung, were brutally killed in their home. The following year, Chen Wen-chen, a Taiwan-born statistics professor teaching at Carnegie Mellon University, was killed and his body dumped in the grounds of National Taiwan University. At around the same time, the dissident journalist Henry Liu wrote an unauthorized critical biography of Chiang Ching-kuo, the president of Taiwan. Liu was assassinated in 1984 by members of the Bamboo Union who were subsequently caught and convicted. His murderers, one being \"King Duck\" Chen Chi-li, were sentenced to life in prison, although Chen and most of the others convicted were paroled by 1991; Tung Kuei-sen was stabbed to death while in prison in 1991; he was the only one convicted for participating in or planning the murder who was not eventually paroled.\n\nIn July 2009, Bamboo Union hitman Bai Xiao Ye stabbed and slashed a man to death in a Las Vegas, Nevada karaoke bar and wounded two others. In 2013, Bai was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Bai had also been charged with fatally shooting a man and wounding another at a Los Angeles karaoke bar. In October 2015, the Bamboo Union struck again and had one of their most notorious cases as they were linked to the kidnapping of Hong Kong businessman Wong Yuk-kwan.\n\nOne of the most significant events that have taken place in the Bamboo Union's legacy was the death and funeral of their former leader Chen Chi-Li. The former leader had maintained a very complicated relationship between the criminal organization and the Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang) regime. He died of cancer in 2007 and his funeral brought more than 10,000 mourners. His mourners included a number of politicians from Taiwan's still-young democracy which has struggled to shrug off long-standing links to the criminal underworld. Fellow gangsters said that Chen did not understand why the government would treat a patriot like him as a criminal. He was not a normal gangster, but an idealist who had made money to do the right thing. Representatives of Taiwan's three main criminal organizations, the Bamboo Union, the Four Seas Triad and the Celestial Way, were on hand to pay their respects to Mr. Li. Members of Japan's feared yakuza, dressed in black suits, were also among the guests, while representatives from crime families of Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Thailand also joined the procession under the watchful gaze of thousands of police. More than 1,000 police officers were assigned to monitor and videotape the movements of the mourners, a number of whom are 'big brothers' of local gangs. The family spent NT$2 million (HK$475,000) to charter a China Airlines Airbus plane to transport the body, plus friends and relatives to Taiwan. According to local news media, the family was spending at least NT$20 million to make sure Chen's funeral was held in grand style.\n\nUnlike Japan's yakuza or Italy's mafia, the United Bamboo does not have a strict rank-and-file. Twenty-four members are each led by a big brother or \"da ge\" with membership comprising gangland enforcers and individual businessmen. Due to its structure United Bamboo and its activities usually fly below the radar. Mutual benefits and obligations underpin the relationships within the gang, as members who may not do business with one another will turn to one another in times of crisis. All members paid homage to Chang, who was \"recognized\" by Taiwan's triads as their \"opinion leader\" in 1995 and who was held in such esteem that legitimate businessmen ask him to help settle disputes.\n\nThe gang has a \"code of ethics\" that has ten rules that all members must follow. The mainland branch of the Bamboo Union is disciplined and well organized, complete with rank systems, promotions, and benefits. Senior gang figures are given the honorific suffix \"Da Ge\", or \"Big Brother\". According to the junior Bamboo Union \"boss\" Big Brother Su, the gang is divided into approximately 13 divisions, or tang kou, with names such as \"Tiger Division\" and \"Dragon Division\". Within those 13 divisions, there are 68 branches of members.\n\nBecause of the mainland origins of its membership, the Bamboo Union developed close links with military intelligence and security agencies. It participates in many illegal activities like security services, debt collection, loan sharking, gambling dens, hostess clubs, restaurants, and small businesses. It is known internationally for drug smuggling, human trafficking, and silencing journalists as far away as Northern California. \n\n\n"}

There is some debate as to whether or not these are true martini. \n\nAn \"Espresso Martini\" is made with vodka, espresso coffee, coffee liqueur, and sugar syrup. It is popular in restaurants as a dessert. Many variations exist, but most involve shaking an espresso shot with the ingredients and served in a chilled martini glass.

In addition to being a general of the Royal Italian Army, he was also a senator and governor. He held high commands during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (Ethiopia), the Spanish Civil War, and the North African Campaign.\n\nBastico was born in Bologna, Italy. When he came of age, Bastico joined the Italian Army and fought in World War I. In 1928, Bastico was promoted to brigadier \"(generale di brigata)\". At that time, the Kingdom of Italy was ruled by dictator Benito Mussolini.\n\nIn this role, Bastico was a target of Giulio Douhet in \"Recapitulation\" (published with the work \"The Command of the Air\"). Douhet devotes many pages to critically examining six \"basic theories\" put forth by Bastico and how they relate to the future of an Independent Air Force's role in future wars.\n\nBastico was promoted to major general on 29 May 1932 and in 1935, he commanded the 1st Blackshirt Division (\"23 Marzo\") during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. In 1935, Bastico was the commander of the III Corps in Ethiopia and on 10 February 1936 he was promoted to lieutenant general \"(generale di corpo d'armata)\". From 1936 to 1937, he was the commander of the II Corps.\n\nIn 1937, during the later stages of the Spanish Civil War, Bastico replaced Mario Roatta as the commander-in-chief of the Italian volunteer corps in Spain, the \"Corpo Truppe Volontarie\". The CTV was sent to help the Spanish Nationalists side in the war. From mid-1937, Bastico's force fought in the Battle of Santander, a decisive victory for the Nationalists. In late 1937, Bastico was replaced by Mario Berti. In October 1937, Bastico received the rank of general, \"generale di corpo d'armata designato d'armata,\" the highest rank that could be assigned if Italy was not officially at war. In February 1939, the Italian volunteers left Spain.\n\nHe was then assigned to the Second Army. Shortly after, Bastico was appointed commander of the new motorized Sixth Army, known at the \"Armata del Po,\" stationed in the Po Valley area. In 1939, Bastico was named senator of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nWhen Italy entered World War II, Bastico was Governor-General of the Italian Aegean Islands (Dodecanese Islands) and he was promoted to full general \"(Generale d'Armata)\" on 7 August 1940. \n\nOn 19 July 1941, Bastico was named commander over all Axis forces in North Africa. As Rommel's superior in the North African campaign, his plans had to be first approved by Bastico.\n\nBastico was promoted to Marshal of Italy (\"Maresciallo d'Italia\") on 12 August 1942, largely to avoid him being junior in rank to Rommel. \n\nWhen Libya was lost to the Eighth Army's advance, since 2 February 1943 he was left without a command for the rest of the war.\n\nBastico died in Rome at 96, after spending his last years studying history. At the time of his death, he was the last living Italian military officer to have held an Italian five-star-rank in an active capacity. (Umberto II, the last King of Italy, who was appointed a marshal of Italy in a ceremonial capacity, died in 1983).\n\n\nBastico wrote some books about Italian military history.

How the word came into Spanish is less certain, and there are multiple competing explanations. Perhaps the most cited explanation is that \"chocolate\" comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word \"chocolātl\", which many sources derived from the Nahuatl word \"xocolātl\" made up from the words \"xococ\" meaning sour or bitter, and \"ātl\" meaning water or refreshment. However, as William Bright noted the word \"chocolatl\" does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation. Santamaria gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word \"chokol\" meaning hot, and the Nahuatl \"atl\" meaning water. More recently Dakin and Wichmann derive it from another Nahuatl term, \"chicolatl\" from Eastern Nahuatl meaning \"beaten drink\".

{"id": "1979874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979874", "title": "ShadowCrew", "text": "ShadowCrew\n\nShadowCrew was a cybercrime message board (forum) that operated under the domain name ShadowCrew.com between August 2002 – November 2004.\nThe concept of the ShadowCrew was developed in early 2002 during a series of chat sessions between Brett Johnson (Gollumfun), Seth Sanders (Kidd), and Kim Marvin Taylor (MacGayver). The ShadowCrew website also contained a number of sub-forums where the latest information about hacking tricks, social engineering, credit card fraud, virus development, scams, and phishing.\n\nShadowCrew offered a haven for DarkWayne, TonyEffe and la dpg caramelle and KiLo and oxy hackers to trade, buy, and sell anything from stolen personal information, to hacked credit card numbers and false identification. ShadowCrew emerged from another underground site, counterfeitlibrary.com which was ran by Brett Johnson, in early 2002. and would be followed up by carderplanet.com owned by a.k.a. Script, a website primarily in the Russian language. The site also facilitated the sale of drugs wholesale.\n\nDuring its early years, the site was hosted overseas, in Hong Kong, but shortly before CumbaJohnny (Albert Gonzalez)'s arrest, the server was in his possession, somewhere in New Jersey.\n\nShadowCrew was the forerunner of NEVER cybercrime forums and marketplaces. The structure, marketplace, review system, and other innovations began when Shadowcrew laid the basis of today's underground forums and marketplaces. Likewise, many of today's current scams and computer crimes began with Counterfeitlibrary and Shadowcrew.\nThe site flourished from the time it opened in 2002 until its demise in late October 2004. Even though the site was booming with criminal activity and all seemed well, the members did not know what was going on behind the scenes. Federal agents received their \"big break\" when they found CumbaJohnny. Upon Cumba's arrest, he immediately turned and started working with federal agents. From April 2003 to October 2004, Cumba assisted in gathering information and monitoring the site and those who utilized it. He started by taking out many of the Russians who were hacking databases and selling counterfeit credit cards. It was later confirmed that a high-ranking member of the inner-circle of the ShadowCrew, CumbaJohnny (Albert Gonzalez) was a long term police informant who was responsible for teaching the US Secret Service how to monitor, trap and arrest the ShadowCrew. \n\nThe Federal indictment says, \"Shadowcrew was an international organization of approximately 4,000 members…\" The last available page before October 27, 2004 on archive.org shows 2,709 registered FOUND. To people familiar with the ShadowCrew forum, it is well known that many members had multiple user names. Members who were banned from the forum would frequently register with another user name as well. Lastly, the forum was around for over 2 years so there were possibly many inactive accounts. However, there was also a need by members to develop a name that could be trusted; so it is possible that the idea that most of the registered users were duplicates isn't accurate.\n\n$4 million in losses is the believed amount dealt with through this forum. This figure was arrived at by multiplying the number of credit cards transferred by $500 each (as per federal law when no monetary figure in a fraud case can be determined). This figure assumes that every single card was valid and had been used. The dollar figure quoted only pertains to the evidence gathered by the VPN employed and the members. The actual dollar figure is potentially much higher due to the fact that the $500 per card federal law wasn't in existence until after federal agents took down the site.\n\nShadowCrew admin Brett Johnson managed to avoid being arrested following the 2004 raids, but was picked up in 2005 on separate charges, in which he then turned informant for the Secret Service. Continuing to commit tax fraud as an informant, 'Operation Anglerphish' embedded him, then dubbed by Secret Service agents as \"The Original Internet Godfather\", as admins on both ScandinavianCarding and CardersMarket. When his continued carding activities were exposed as a part of a separate investigation in 2006, he briefly went on the run and made the USA Most Wanted List before being caught in August of that year.\n\nIn 2011, former Bulgarian ShadowCrew member Aleksi Kolarov a.k.a. APK was finally arrested and held in Paraguay before being extradited to the United States in 2013 to face charges.\n\n\n"}

In NCAA, NBA and WNBA basketball, goaltending is also called if the ball has already touched the backboard while being above the height of the rim in its flight, regardless of it being in an upward or downward flight or whether it is directly above the rim. Goaltending in this context defines by exclusion what is considered a legal block of a field goal. In high school and NCAA basketball, goaltending is also called when a player interferes with a free throw at any time in its flight towards the basket.\nIf goaltending is called for interference with a field goal, the shooting team is awarded the points for the field goal as if it had been made. The team who commits the violation then inbounds the ball at its baseline, the same as if it had conceded a basket. In high school and NCAA basketball, if goaltending is called on a free throw, the shooting team is awarded one point and a technical foul is called against the offending player. \n\nGoaltending is commonly confused with the related violation of basket interference (also called offensive goaltending) which occurs during an attempted field goal when a player touches the basket, the rim, or the ball when it is on the rim or directly above it. Like goaltending, basket interference when committed by the defending team results in an award of points to the shooting team as if the attempted field goal had been made.\n\nFIBA rules allow a defender to block any shot that is over the rim and the ball is on its upward flight.\n\nThe prohibition against goaltending was adopted by the NCAA in 1944 (and later by the NBL) specifically because of George Mikan. Prior to the advent of the high-jumping 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) Mikan, goaltending was not addressed because it was thought physically impossible.\n\nIt is possible for a team to goaltend at the buzzer, although this is very rare. This is because, according to (W)NBA rules, once the shot is taken, the period will be over, so goaltending rules would still apply even after the clock hits 0. It happened in the 2012–13 season, when Jermaine O'Neal was called for a goaltend against the Houston Rockets after time expired. This happened in the 4th quarter, so the Phoenix Suns lost the game 101–98.\n"}

{"id": "1979903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979903", "title": "Non-Chalcedonian Christianity", "text": "Non-Chalcedonian Christianity\n\nNon-Chalcedonianism is a religious doctrine of those Christian churches that do not accept the Confession of Chalcedon as defined at the ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451. The doctrine contrasts with Chalcedonian Christianity, which accepts the doctrines of the first seven Ecumenical Councils. Some Christian denominations do not accept the Confession of Chalcedon, for varying reasons, but accept the doctrines of the previous council at the Council of Ephesus in 431.\n\nThe most substantial non-Chalcedonian tradition is known as Oriental Orthodoxy. Within this tradition are a number of ancient Christian churches including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Syriac Orthodox Church (sometimes referred to as \"Jacobite\"), the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.\n\nThe Christology of the Church of the East (i.e., Nestorian Christianity) may be called \"non-Ephesine\" for not accepting the Council of Ephesus, but did finally gather to ratify the Council of Chalcedon at the Synod of Mar Aba I in 544.\n\nWithin the Patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch, the rejection of the Chalcedonian definition became a cause of schism. While the common people of Egypt and Syria mostly objected to the Council, the Byzantine-Greek minority that formed the ruling class mostly accepted the Council. These two parties vied for possession of the ancient sees of Alexandria and Antioch that formed, at the time, the third and fourth most prestigious sees in Christendom, respectively. Ultimately, neither group absolutely dominated either church. The end result was the existence of two distinct patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch for almost 1500 years, continuing in the present time. What is now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the native Egyptian patriarchal faction of Alexandria that rejected Chalcedon, whereas the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria is composed of those who accepted Chalcedon. For Syrians, the Syriac Orthodox Church forms the patriarchal faction of the native Syrian-Semitic population whereas the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch is composed of those who accepted Chalcedon.\n\nIn India and to a lesser degree in Persia, the schism that occurred was between the Oriental Orthodox and the Assyrian Church of the East. Even today in Kerala, there is a continuing presence of both the Assyrian Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church along with an Independent Oriental Orthodox Church called the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.\n\nIn the 18th century and onwards, Nontrinitarian and Unitarian Christians are necessarily non-Chalcedonian having their own separate traditions, different nontrinitarian theologies, and polities. The largest such groups are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Latter-day Saint movement), Jehovah's Witnesses and the Iglesia ni Cristo.\n\n\n"}

The plant is native and endemic to a limited area of the Sikhote-Alin mountains in Primorskiy Krai in the Russian Far East. The name causes much confusion because of other meanings for the word \"microbiota\", but the genus name was derived from \"micro-\", meaning \"small\", + \"Biota\", the genus name for a closely related conifer, a species formerly called \"Biota orientalis\", now renamed \"Platycladus orientalis.\"\n\"Microbiota decussata\" is a prostrate shrub to in height, and in spreading width. The foliage forms flat sprays with scale-like leaves 2–4 mm long. The cones are among the smallest of any conifer, 2–3 mm long, green ripening brown in about 8 months from pollination, and have 4 scales arranged in two opposite pairs. The seeds are 2 mm long, with no wing; there is usually only one seed in each cone, rarely two. The foliage sometimes turns brown in winter, giving the impression that the plant has died; but it revives in spring.\n\nThe monotypic taxon \"Microbiota\" was discovered in 1923, but political secrecy in the former Soviet Union prevented any knowledge of its existence outside the country for around 50 years.\n\n\"Microbiota\" is generally accepted as being a distinct genus. It has also been suggested, but not widely followed, that \"Microbiota\" could be included in the closely related genus \"Platycladus\". Other fairly close relatives are the genera \"Juniperus\" and \"Cupressus\".\n\n\"Microbiota decussata\" is grown as an ornamental plant for use as evergreen groundcover in gardens and parks. It is valued for its drought tolerance and considerable cold temperature and winter season conditions tolerance. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n"}
{"id": "1979905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979905", "title": "Mount Hudson", "text": "Mount Hudson\n\nMount Hudson (, ) is a stratovolcano in southern Chile, and the site of one of the largest eruptions in the twentieth century. The mountain itself is covered by a glacier. There is a caldera at the summit from an ancient eruption; modern volcanic activity comes from inside the caldera. Mount Hudson is named after Francisco Hudson, a 19th-century Chilean Navy hydrographer.\n\nLarge eruptions around 4750 BCE and 1890 BCE are believed to have been of Volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 6; these are probably responsible for the large caldera. The 4750 BCE eruption may have wiped out many or all of the groups living in central Patagonia at that time, based on evidence from the Los Toldos archaeological site. Recently, the volcano has had moderate eruptions in 1891 and 1971 as well as a large eruption in 1991.\n\nBefore 1970, little was known about the mountain. Minor eruptive activity began in 1970 and melted parts of the glacier, raising river water levels and leading to the identification of the caldera. In August–September 1971, a moderate eruption (VEI 3) located in the northwest area of the caldera sent ash into the air and caused lahars from the melting of a large portion of the glacier. The lahars killed five people; many more were evacuated.\n\nThe eruption in August to October 1991 was a large plinian eruption with a VEI of 5, that ejected 4.3 km bulk volume (2.7 cubic km of dense rock equivalent material). Parts of the glacier melted and ran down the mountain as mud flows (see glacier run). Due to the remoteness of the area, no-one was killed but hundreds of people were evacuated from the vicinity. Ash fell on Chile and Argentina as well as in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Falkland Islands. In 1992, John Locke Blake, then resident on Estancia Condor, south of Rio Gallegos, in Argentina describes the effects of the eruption vividly. He describes an ash fall up to 15 cm in depth, covering some 150,000 to 180,000 square kilometres in a triangle from Los Antiguos to Deseado to San Julian to a depth of between 5 and 10 cm. He reports that the hygroscopicity of the silica caused the formation of morasses around drinking places causing sheep to be trapped and die in huge numbers. He records that 'ten years later, most of the farms in the affected area are empty, of sheep and of people'.\n\nIn addition to the ash, a large amount of sulfur dioxide gas and aerosols were ejected in the eruption. These contributed to those already in the atmosphere from the even larger 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo earlier in the year and helped cause a worldwide cooling effect over the following years. Ozone was also depleted, with the Antarctic ozone hole growing to its largest levels ever recorded in 1992 and 1993.\n\nAs a result of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the Hudson eruption received little attention at the time.\n\nOn October 26, the Chilean Service for Geology and Minery issued a red alert and a mass evacuation of the region surrounding the volcano, fearing an imminent eruption in the coming hours or days. It happened on Oct 31 but was small and didn't do any damage to the area.\n\n"}
{"id": "1979907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979907", "title": "Bulgari", "text": "Bulgari\n\nBulgari (, ; stylized as BVLGARI) is an Italian luxury brand known for its jewellery, watches, fragrances, accessories and leather goods.\n\nWhile the majority of design, production and marketing is overseen and executed by Bulgari, the company does, at times, partner with other entities. For example, Bulgari eyewear is produced through a licensing agreement with Luxottica, and Bulgari formed a joint venture with Marriott International in 2001 to launch its hotel brand, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, a collection of properties and resort destinations around the world.\n\nCurrently part of the LVMH Group, Bulgari was founded in the region of Epirus, Greece, in 1884 by the silversmith Sotirios Boulgaris (Greek: Σωτήριος Βούλγαρης, Italian: Sotirio Bulgari) as a single jewellery shop that has, over the years, become an international brand. The company has evolved into a player in the luxury market, with an established and growing network of stores.\n\nThe trademark is usually written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet, and it is derived from the surname of the company's founder, Sotirios Voulgaris (1857–1932; , ).\n\nThe BVLGARI logo was used for the first time in 1934, when its gilded brass letters graced the central doorway of the Via Condotti flagship store. In reference to ancient Rome, the \"U\" was replaced with the letter \"V\", and a logo was born. Since then, the trademark is written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet.\n\nThe Voulgaris were a silversmithing family from the Epirus region of Greece. Whether or not the Voulgaris family of Corfu and the Voulgaris family of the Italian jewelers Bulgari from Epirus share the same paternal line is unclear, but the count Stefanos Voulgaris denied that the Bulgari family of the Italian jewelers family is genealogically related to the Voulgaris family of Corfu. According to chronicles of the Voulgaris family written in Venetian Corfu, the \"Voulgaris family of Saint Spyridon of Corfu\" descend from the royal figures of barbarian peoples from the Volga river, who \"finally settled in Moesia near the Haemus mountains, located in Bulgaria\", so the founding father of this family was described as the \"Triballian\" (de facto Serbian) Prince Stefan Lazarevic in the 16th century testemant of the family, becoming such by taking refugee in the Venetian island Corfu.\n\nThe founder of the Bulgari brand is Sotirios Voulgaris (, ) who was born in March 1857 and came from the Epirus Village of Paramythia, the largest Aromanian center of silversmithing in the Balkans. He was one of eleven children of his father Georgios Voulgaris (1823–1889) and his Aromanian mother Eleni Stronggaris. In 1881, Sotirios Bulgari moved to Rome and, in 1884, opened his first store on via Sistina 85. In 1888, he married Aromanian Eleni Basio with whom he had six children: Constantine-Georgios (1889–1973), Leonidas-Georgios (1890–1966), Maria-Athena (1891–1976), Sofia (1893–1908), Alexandra (1895–1984) and Spyridon (1897–1932); Leonidas-Georgios is the father of the current chairman of the company, Paolo Bulgari. In 1905, he unveiled the Via Condotti shop that would become the company's flagship. In its early years, Bulgari was known for silver pieces that borrowed elements from Byzantine and Islamic art, combining them with floral motifs. At the time, Paris was the apex of fashion and creativity, and its trends influenced Sotirio's designs for decades: jewels of the early 20s were characterised by platinum Art Deco settings while those of the 30s featured geometric diamond motifs—sometimes set in combination with coloured gemstones. Convertible jewels were also popular during the time, and one of Bulgari's major piece was the \"Trombino\", a small trumpet-shaped ring.\n\nIn 1932 Sotirio died, leaving the business to his two sons, Giorgio (1890–1966) and Costantino (1889–1973), who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels. During the Second World War, most new jewellery was crafted out of gold, as gems were scarce, and designs became more natural feeling. As the 1940s came to a close, Bulgari introduced \"Serpenti\" bracelet-watches.\nIn the 50s some of Bulgari best-known clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Anna Magnani, Ingrid Bergman and Gina Lollobrigida as Rome earned a reputation as \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" with the Cinecittà studios.\n\nAt the same time, Bulgari went to a new style. The post-war boom saw a return to precious materials, particularly white metals covered in diamonds. In the 50s, Bulgari launched its first floral brooches—called \"en tremblant\" because of their trembling diamond corollas. At the end of the 50s, Bulgari began to establish its motifs, introducing structured, symmetrical shapes in yellow gold set with brilliant gems—chosen for their colour rather than intrinsic value. Among these multi-hued jewels, cabochon cuts were another innovation. These new pieces were a significant departure from classical Parisian design.\nAfter Giorgio's death in 1966, his son Gianni led the company as co-chief executive with his cousin Marina.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bulgari stores opened in New York, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Paris. This era marks the beginning of the Group's international expansion, with Gianni as chairman and CEO. A number of new motifs made their debut as well—jewels became recognisable for their angular forms, strong colours, oval elements with cabochons, chains and maxi sautoirs, whilst the predominant use of yellow gold made precious pieces feel all the more wearable, and became known as a Bulgari trademark. In 1977, Bulgari entered the world of horlogerie with the launch of the \"BVLGARI BVLGARI\" watch. At the time, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, focusing on product design.\n\nIn the early 80s, to oversee all production of Bulgari watches, Bulgari Time was founded in Switzerland. In 1984, Paolo and Nicola Bulgari, Giorgio's sons, became Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, while their nephew, Francesco Trapani, became Chief Executive Officer. In 1985, Gianni resigned as CEO and in 1987, he left the family business after selling his one-third stake in the company to his brothers Nicola and Paolo.\n\nBulgari diversified its brand in 1993 with the launch of its first fragrance, \"Eau Parfumée au\" \"The Vert\" and the founding of Bulgari Parfums in Switzerland to oversee the creation and production of all perfumes. In 1995, Bulgari pushed ahead with an aggressive programme for growth, becoming listed on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time. In 1996, the brand launched its first accessories collection, beginning with silk scarves before developing a range of leather accessories and eyewear. In 1999, the brand launched the B.zero1 ring.\n\nThe company has seen 150% revenue growth between 1997 and 2003. Bvlgari continues to build up many brands which has made them one of the most profitable luxury brands in the jewelry industry.\n\nThe year 2000 was the beginning of an increasingly aggressive period of verticalization for Bulgari, with the acquisition of the luxury watchmaking brands Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta, followed by the takeover of the jewellery firm Crova and of other companies that specialised in leather goods and watchmaking. The opening of the first Bulgari Hotel in Milan in 2004 further confirmed the expansion strategy of the brand, and was the result of a joint venture with Luxury Group, a division of Marriot International. In 2009, Bulgari celebrated its 125th anniversary with a retrospective of the brand's history, held in Rome at Palazzo delle Esposizioni. That same year, the snake—a motif that appeared in Bulgari collections from the 1960s—re-emerged as the emblem of the \"Serpenti\" collection. In 2011, Bulgari signed a strategic alliance with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world's leading luxury group. The agreement was based on a stock transfer of the Bulgari family's shares in Bulgari S.p.A. to LVMH, an all-share deal for €4.3 billion ($6.01 billion), higher than LVMH had offered for any other company. Under the deal, the Bulgari family sold their 50.4 per cent controlling stake in exchange for 3 per cent of LVMH, thereby becoming the second-biggest family shareholder behind the Arnaults in LVMH. The takeover doubled the size of LVMH's watches and jewellery unit, which at the time of the acquisition included Tag Heuer timepieces and De Beers diamond necklaces. The acquisition concluded on 4 October 2011 as Bulgari was delisted from the Borsa Italiana.\n\nIn 2014, Bulgari celebrated the 130th anniversary of the brand. To mark the occasion, the shop at Via Condotti 10 was \"reimagined\" by the architect Peter Marino, and reopened. On the same day, the brand donated €1.5 million to the city of Rome for the restoration of the Spanish Steps. A few months after the Grand Opening, the DOMVS was inaugurated in the redesigned Bulgari boutique, creating a gallery space to house of Bulgari's Heritage Collection.\n\nIn 2017 Bulgari opened a new jewellery manufacturing headquarters in Valenza. The largest in Europe, with a total area of 14,000sqm, the Manufacture has been given a Gold LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification for sustainability in its design. The facility was built over the former home of the first goldsmith in Valenza, Francesco Caramora. The buildings follow the model of a Roman domus, and are built around a central courtyard.\n\nBulgari's jewellery collections include \"B.zero1, Divas' Dream, Serpenti, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Parentesi,\" and a bridal line. \n\nBulgari's watches collections include \"Octo, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Diagono\" and \"Haute Horlogerie\" creations for men, and \"LVCEA, Serpenti, Divas' Dream, BVLGARI BVLGARI, B.zero1\" and High Jewellery timepieces for women. It mixes Italian design and Swiss watchmaking. The company's Swiss subsidiary, Bulgari Haute Horlogerie SA, is responsible for Bulgari's watch production. It was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Neuchâtel. Bulgari Haute Horlogerie SA employs about 500 people.\n\nFragrances include \"Goldea, Splendida\" and \"Omnia\" for women, \"BVLGARI Man, Aqua\", \"the Classics\", and \"Blv Pour Homme\" for men, whilst \"BVLGARI Le Gemme\" and \"Eau Parfumée\".\n\nThe creation of Bulgari accessories and leather goods is handled in the Bulgari atelier in Florence, and twice a year presents its collections at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nIn 2001, Bulgari formed a joint venture with The Ritz-Carlton, a hotel brand owned by Marriott International, to launch Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, a collection of hotels and resort destinations around the world.\n\nTheir distinctive settings and Italian design by the architectural firm Antonio Citterio-Patricia Viel characterise the properties of Bulgari Hotel Group. These are Milan (opened in 2004), Bali (2006), London (2012), Beijing (2017), Dubai (2017) and Shanghai (2018). Hotels in Moscow, Paris and Tokyo are due to open between 2020 and 2022. As of 31 December 2018, it has 6 hotels with 523 rooms.\n\nBulgari has about 300 stores. The largest is the 10-story Bulgari Ginza Tower in Tokyo, 940 square meters of retail floor space, including a restaurant and lounge bar.\n\nNorth American Bulgari boutiques and distributors are found in Aspen, Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Bal Harbour, Boca Raton, Bethesda (Chevy Chase), Charlotte, Chicago, Costa Mesa, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, King of Prussia, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas. Mx, Montreal, Palm Beach, San Francisco, Short Hills, Scottsdale, Arizona, and Toronto.\n\nSouth American Bulgari distributors are found in Lima, Bogotá, São Paulo, Margarita island & Quito.\n\nIn 2009, Bulgari began a partnership with Save the Children, including a co-branded jewellery collection, of which a portion of the proceeds went to the charity. As of 2018, Bulgari's contribution has totalled $80 million.\n\nThe Bulgari Art Award is an annual art award in partnership with the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Sponsored by Bulgari the $50,000 acquisitive cash award plus $30,000 residency in Italy is presented to mid-career Australian artists. The inaugural prize winner in 2012 was Michael Zavros.

The program airs around the world through both religious broadcasters and the purchase of paid programming time on commercial television stations. He was known as the \"Walking Bible\", having memorized most of the \nKing James Version of the Bible. His wife, Rexella, shared his television ministry as co-host.\n\nVan Impe's parents, Oscar Alphonse Van Impe and Marie Louise, née Piot, immigrated from Belgium to the city of Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, in the United States in 1929. Jack Leo Van Impe was born on February 9, 1931, in Freeport, Michigan. He was the couple's only child. Van Impe decided to become an evangelist after he saw his father become a missionary with very strong faith.\n\nAccording to Van Impe, he and his father Oscar played the accordion at night clubs, and Oscar regularly swore and drank alcohol, and believed that religion was hogwash. At meals, Van Impe would drink alcoholic beverages along with his father, which is a European tradition. Then when Van Impe was twelve years old, Oscar converted to evangelical Christianity, and Oscar and Jack together smashed all of their bottles of alcoholic beverages. Since that event, Van Impe did not consume any alcohol.\n\nJack Van Impe played accordion duets with his missionary father across Michigan and other states. In 1948, Van Impe graduated from high school and entered Detroit Bible Institute, where he earned his diploma in 1952. It was then that he began his career as a preacher and evangelist and extensive recording career.\n\nWhile working with the Billy Graham crusades, he was at a Youth For Christ rally with Chuck Ohman (a friend of Jack's who was a trumpeter for Percy Crawford's \"Youth on the March\" television broadcasts). Here, Jack Van Impe met his future wife, Rexella Mae Shelton, who was an organist with the crusades. Rexella was born in Missouri on November 29, 1932, and was named after her father, Rex Shelton. The couple were married on August 21, 1954, and together started Jack Van Impe Ministries.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Van Impe released dozens of Gospel and spoken word recordings. His first album \"Presenting the Van Impes\" features Jack on the accordion and Rexella on organ. Subsequent musical recordings featured the accorgan, a type of electronic accordion.\n\nJack Van Impe believed in one particular interpretation of the literal meaning of the Bible (King James version) that states, according to Revelation 13, that a single world political leader (The Beast) and a single world religious leader (the False Prophet) will emerge, but The Rapture will happen before either leader comes to power. He believed that the Bible teaches that the world will be organized into ten political subdivisions, based on the ten-district plan set up by the Club of Rome, and that this ten-division world empire will be jointly ruled by the European Union and the Islamic world, which he believed are represented by the two iron legs of the prophetic dream statue in the Book of Daniel. Van Impe believed in the Prophecy of the Popes, and that according to said prophecy, Pope Francis is Peter the Roman, the predicted pope who will preside during Armageddon.\n\nVan Impe preached a Pre-Tribulation Rapture of \"The Body of Christ\" and also said a one-world religion will form, named \"Chrislam\"; the joining of the world's two largest religions (Christianity and Islam). He believed that the Bible states that the world political leader will \"come in peaceably\" (per Daniel 11:21) and create a seven-year peace deal involving Israel (per Daniel 9:27). Then, three and a half years into the peace, Russia (the interpreted meaning of \"Rosh\" from Ezekiel 38:2 and 39:1; Van Impe also identified Meshech and Tubal from the same passages as Moscow and Tobolsk respectively), along with its Middle Eastern allies (\"Persia, Cush, and Put\", from Ezekiel 38:5), will break the peace by invading Israel, according to Ezekiel 38, and the military of Russia and its allies will be decimated by nuclear warfare and pushed back to Siberia. Then China (the interpreted meaning of \"kings from the east\" from Revelation 16:12) will invade, and the military of China will likewise be decimated when Jesus returns.\n\n\"Jack Van Impe Presents\" is a weekly telecast produced by Van Impe's non-profit organization at the Jack Van Impe Ministries World Outreach Center, in Rochester Hills, Michigan. Van Impe's wife, Rexella, co-hosts.\n\nOn a typical show, Rexella begins by reading recent news headlines. Van Impe then applies his memorization of Bible verses to interpret the news stories, usually to show that they are manifestations of biblically-predicted signs of the end of the age.\n\nTwice during the broadcast, once in the middle of the broadcast and once at the end, announcer Chuck Ohman describes a DVD that is being sold by the ministry, and how to order. (Rexella announced Ohman's wife's death on the March 12, 2016 broadcast.) Near the end of the broadcast, Jack looked at the camera and said a personal prayer to Jesus, asking viewers to say the prayer with him. On the Christmas and Easter broadcasts, a video of Rexella singing a hymn in her younger years is aired.\n\nRecurring topics include a New World Order consisting of one world government and one world religion, prophecies of future wars and the second coming of Jesus, modern \"Chrislam\", differences between the biblical Jesus and the Jesus of Islam, the proposed United Nations blasphemy law and Islamic extremism, the removal of crosses from churches, the importance of doctrine, and criticism of such individuals as Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Rick Warren, Robert Schuller, Joel Osteen, and Oprah Winfrey. Van Impe has made favorable mention of retired Pope Benedict, Vice President Mike Pence, and President Donald Trump. He also cited numerous Bible verses, with emphasis on various selections that were his favorites, using the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nIn 2017, Van Impe began a commission from the Holy Spirit to announce the return of Jesus Christ, a passion he attributed to his extensive memorization of Bible texts cited with chapter and verse. However, in the June 30, 2018 program, due to his illness and coma, he stated that \"The verses have all come back, but sometimes the numbers are a little difficult\". For the October 6, 2018 program, Jack stated that his wife, Rexella, was also chosen with him by the Holy Spirit to help reach the 7.6 Billion people on Earth with the Gospel in the last days.\n\nIn June 2011, Trinity Broadcasting Network refused to air an episode of \"Jack Van Impe Presents\" that criticized Robert Schuller and Rick Warren for promoting \"Chrislam\". In response, Van Impe ceased airing his show on TBN.\n\nIn one episode of \"Jack Van Impe Presents\", which aired during the week of June 19, 2006, Van Impe informed his audience that he had undergone two total knee replacements in early 2006. He gave thanks to God for his recovery and for leading him to the \"wonderful surgeon\" who performed the operation. Subsequent to the problems with his knees, Van Impe suffered from cancer, a severe sepsis attack, and blood loss resulting from stomach ulcers which he attributed to his NSAID arthritis medication. On the episode which aired during the week of May 31, 2015, Jack Van Impe was absent from the program, and Rexella Van Impe explained that he had been hospitalized for triple by-pass heart surgery. Carl Baugh co-hosted the program until Van Impe's return to his weekly show on October 3, 2015.\n\nOn January 7, 2017, Rexella Van Impe announced that Jack Van Impe had broken his hip, but was recovering. Carl Baugh co-hosted that program as well. In Jack's absence, Rexella Van Impe co-hosted the program with various guests: Carl Baugh for six episodes, Dave Williams for six episodes, Dr. Robert Jeffress for two episodes, and Walt Sheppard for three episodes. From April to May, 2017, re-runs were aired until the May 27, 2017, broadcast when Jack Van Impe reappeared beside Rexella, and the couple announced that, under doctor's advice, they were ending the TV broadcast. Thereafter, weekly videos were posted on the organization's Web site. In 2018, radio and television broadcasts resumed, with Chuck Ohman serving as their announcer.\n\nJack Van Impe died on January 18, 2020 at a hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan at the age of 88.\n\n"}

{"id": "1979936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979936", "title": "Spanish prepositions", "text": "Spanish prepositions\n\nPrepositions in the Spanish language —like those in other languages— are a set of connecting words (such as \"con\", \"de\" or \"para\") that serve to indicate a relationship between a content word (noun, verb, or adjective) and a following noun phrase (or noun, or pronoun), known as the object of the preposition. The relationship is typically spatial or temporal, but prepositions express other relationships as well. As implied by the name, Spanish \"pre-positions\" (like those of English) are positioned \"before\" their objects. Spanish does not place these function words \"after\" their objects; the language does not use postpositions.\n\nSpanish prepositions can be classified as either \"simple\", consisting of a single word, or \"compound\", consisting of two or three words. The prepositions of Spanish form a closed class, meaning that they constitute a limited set to which new items are rarely added. Many Spanish school pupils memorize the following list: \"a, ante, bajo, cabe, con, contra, de, desde, durante, en, entre, hacia, hasta, mediante, para, por, según, sin, so, sobre, and tras.\" This list includes two archaic prepositions — \"so\" (“under”) and \"cabe\" (“beside”) — and it excludes \"vía\" (“by way of, via”) and \"pro\" (“in favor of”), two Latinisms recently adopted into the language.\n\nSome common Spanish prepositions, simple and compound, are listed below, with their meanings.\n\n\"A\" is most often translated as \"to\" or \"at\"; its main uses are the following:\n\n\nPrepositional contraction: \"al\" (“to the”, “to”) is the contraction formed with \"a\" and \"el\" (“the”), the masculine definite article, yet the contraction is waived when the article is part of a proper noun:\n\n\"Con\" is usually translated by English \"with\", both in the sense of accompaniment (\"con mi hermano\", \"with my brother\") and in the instrumental sense (\"con un martillo\", \"with a hammer\"). Unlike other prepositions, \"con\" combines with the prepositional pronouns \"mí\", \"ti\", and \"sí\" in the forms \"conmigo\" (“with me”), \"contigo\" (“with you”), and \"consigo\" (“with her-, himself”). These forms are derived historically from forms with the Latin preposition \"cum\" postposed to its object: \"mēcum\", \"tēcum\", etc. In an Ibero-Romance ancestor of Spanish, before the time of written records, an etymologically redundant \"con\" was prefixed to these forms. Compare the concept of inflected preposition.\n\n\"De\" is the most frequent preposition in Spanish, and in fact it vies with \"que\" to be the most frequent \"word\" in the language. It is most often translated in English by \"of\" or \"from\", but also denotes several other relationships as well.\nThe English possessive with apostrophe-\"s\" is translated by a construction with \"de\":\n\nPrepositional contraction: When \"de\" is followed by the masculine singular definite article \"el\" (“the”), together they form the contraction \"del\" (“of the”). However, \"de\" does not contract with the homophonous personal pronoun \"él\" (\"him\"), nor, in writing, with a proper noun; thus:\n\nTypography: the uppercase form was configured as the siglum Đ — a typographic ligature adopted as a concise written and printed word-character, that originated as a lapidary scribal abbreviation.\n\nThe preposition \"de\" is part of many compound prepositions, such as \"dentro de\" (“within”, “inside of”) and \"en contra de\" (“against . . .”); see Section 2, below, for fuller description.\n\nBoth \"por\" and \"para\" are frequently translated into English as \"for\", and thus they pose a challenge for English-speaking learners of Spanish. In the broadest terms, \"por\" denotes cause or stimulus (with a retrospective focus), while \"para\" denotes destination or purpose (with a prospective focus). The following are common uses of these prepositions:\n\n\n\nIn fast spoken language, the preposition \"para\" often is clipped to \"pa/pa’\", as in the colloquial \"Amos pa’lante.\" (“Let’s go forward.”)—compare the standard \"Vamos para adelante.\" (“Let us go forward.\")\n\n\"Según\" translates as \"according to\". With some uses of \"según\", part or all of the object of the preposition is omitted and merely implied. Often the missing words can be taken as \"lo que\" (\"what\"):\nPopular speech uses it alone, as an equivalent of \"It depends.\"\n\nRegional colloquial usage of the preposition \"según\", with \"que\", expresses evidential mood, indicating hearsay or non-commitment (\"supposedly\", \"it is said\").\n\n\"Sin\" translates as \"without\":\n\nWhen the object of the preposition \"sin\" is a clause introduced by \"que\" (alternatively interpreted as a compound conjunction, \"sin que\"), verb in the clause must be in the subjunctive mood:\n\nSome compound prepositions duplicate the meaning of a simple preposition, but often with a more formal tone or with greater specificity. For example, \"de acuerdo con\" (\"in accordance with\") is equivalent to \"según\" (\"according to\"). \"En dirección a\" (\"in the direction of\") is more ponderous than \"hacia\" (\"toward\"). The English counterpart of Spanish \"en\" may be either \"on\" or \"in\", while \"dentro de\" specifies \"within\". \"Because of\" is only one of several possible meanings of \"por\", but \"por causa de\" conveys that meaning exclusively. In some cases the compound preposition denotes a literal spatial relationship, while the corresponding simple preposition expresses a figurative version of that relationship: thus, debajo de una mesa\" (\"under a table\") vs. bajo un régimen\" (\"under a regime\"), or delante de un edificio\" (\"in front of a building\") vs. ante un tribunal\" (\"before a court of law\").\n\nThe list of compound prepositions is much longer than that of the simple ones, and only some representative examples are listed here.\n\nSpanish compound prepositions can be composed of:\n\n\nOther Spanish compound prepositions include the following:\n\n\nIn certain cases, Spanish prepositions can be used serially, that is, two—or occasionally even three—in succession, as in the following examples:\n\nIn Spain the sequence \"a por\", used mainly with verbs of movement, such as \"ir\" and \"salir\", can be used to mean \"in search of\", or \"to go fetch [something]\". Many speakers consider it to be incorrect and prefer to replace it with \"por\" alone, but according to the Real Academia Española, there is no normative reason to condemn the use of \"a por\". In some contexts, \"a por\" expresses a clearer meaning than \"por\":\n\nThis compound means \"toward\" in the context of an attitude or demeanor toward someone or something:\n\nOther possible serial combinations of prepositions include the following:\n\nThe English language features three types of adpositions — prepositions (preceding), postpositions (following), and circumpositions (enclosing) — allowing constructions such as “in the box”, “on the airplane”, and “out of Africa”, as in Spanish. But the postposition “three years ago” is as impossible in Spanish usage as: “ago three years” is in English. Thus Spanish prepositions function exclusively as such; these examples express equivalent concepts using other mechanisms:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1979947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979947", "title": "Spanish pronouns", "text": "Spanish pronouns\n\nSpanish pronouns in some ways work quite differently from their English counterparts. Subject pronouns are often omitted, and object pronouns can appear either as proclitics that come before the verb or enclitics attached to the end of it in different linguistic environments. There is also regional variation in the use of pronouns, particularly the use of the informal second-person singular \"vos\" and the informal second-person plural \"vosotros\".\n\nPersonal pronouns in Spanish have distinct forms according to whether they stand for a subject (nominative), a direct object (accusative), an indirect object (dative), or a reflexive object. Several pronouns further have special forms used after prepositions. Spanish is a pro-drop language with respect to subject pronouns. Like French and other languages with the T–V distinction, modern Spanish has a distinction in its second person pronouns that has no equivalent in modern English. Object pronouns are generally proclitic, and non-emphatic clitic doubling is most often found with dative clitics. The personal pronoun \"vos\" is used in some areas of Latin America, particularly in Central America, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, the state of Zulia in Venezuela, and the Andean regions of Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.\n\nThe table below shows a cumulative list of personal pronouns from Peninsular, Latin American and Ladino Spanish. Ladino or Judaeo-Spanish, spoken by Sephardic Jews, is different from Latin American and Peninsular Spanish in that it retains rather archaic forms and usage of personal pronouns.\n\nNote: \"usted\" and \"ustedes\", above, are grammatically third person (use third person grammar), even though they are functionally second person (used to express you / you all). See Spanish personal pronouns for more information on this, and on regional variation of pronoun use.\n\n\nAccording to a decision by the \"Real Academia\" in the 1960s, the accents on these forms are only to be used when necessary to avoid ambiguity with the demonstrative determiners. However, the normal educated standard is still as above. Foreign learners may safely adhere to either standard. There is furthermore never an accent on the neuter forms \"esto\", \"eso\" and \"aquello\", which do not have determiner equivalents.\n\nThe main relative pronoun in Spanish is \"que\", from Latin . Others include \"el cual\", \"quien\", and \"donde\".\n\n\"Que\" covers \"that\", \"which\", \"who\", \"whom\" and the null pronoun in their functions of subject and direct-object relative pronouns:\n\nNote from the last example that unlike with other relative pronouns, personal \"a\" does not have to be used with \"que\" when used as a personal direct object.\n\nWhen \"que\" is used as the object of a preposition, the definite article is added to it, and the resulting form (\"el que\") inflects for number and gender, resulting in the forms \"el que\", \"la que\", \"los que\", \"las que\" and the neuter \"lo que\". Unlike in English, the preposition must go right before the relative pronoun \"which\" or \"whom\":\n\n\nIn some people's style of speaking, the definite article may be omitted after \"a\", \"con\" and \"de\" in such usage, particularly when the antecedent is abstract or neuter:\n\nAfter \"en\", the definite article tends to be omitted if precise spatial location is not intended:\n\nWhen used without a precise antecedent, \"lo que\" has a slightly different meaning from that of \"el que\", and is usually used as the connotation of \"that which\" or \"what\":\n\nThe pronoun \"el cual\" can replace \"[el] que\". It is generally more emphatic and formal than \"[el] que\", and it always includes the definite article. It is derived from the Latin , and it has the following forms: \"el cual\", \"la cual\", \"los cuales\", \"las cuales\", and the neuter \"lo cual\". It can be used as a formal, emphatic replacement for \"que\" in non-defining clauses, for both subjects and direct objects, and it can also be used as a formal, emphatic replacement for \"el que\" as the object of some prepositions. Moreover, it is often preferred to \"el que\" entirely in certain contexts. In non-defining clauses, the fact that it agrees for gender and number can make it clearer to what it refers. The fact that it cannot be used as the subject or direct object in defining clauses also makes it clear that a defining clause is not intended:\n\nWhen used as a personal direct object, personal \"a\" must be used:\n\nIn such situations as well as the object of monosyllabic prepositions, the use of \"el cual\" is generally purely a matter of high style. This is used sparingly in Spanish, and foreigners should thus avoid over-using it:\n\nIn more everyday style, this might be phrased as:\n\nAfter multisyllabic prepositions and prepositional phrases (\"a pesar de\", \"debajo de\", \"a causa de\", etc.), however, \"el cual\" is often preferred entirely:\n\n\"El cual\" is further generally preferred entirely when, as the object of a preposition, it is separated from its antecedent by intervening words. The more words that intervene, the more the use of \"el cual\" is practically obligatory:\n\nThe bare form \"cual\" is used as the relative adjective (\"in which sense\", \"with which people\", etc.), which only inflects for number:\n\nThe pronoun \"quien\" comes from the Latin , \"whom\", the accusative of , \"who\".\n\nIt too can replace \"[el] que\" in certain circumstances. Like the English pronouns \"who\" and \"whom\", it can only be used to refer to people.\n\nIt is invariable for gender, and was originally invariable for number. However, by analogy with other words, the form \"quienes\" was invented. \"Quien\" as a plural form survives as an archaism that is now considered non-standard.\n\nIt can represent a subject. In this case, it is rather formal and is largely restricted to non-defining clauses.\n\nUnlike \"el cual\", it does not inflect for gender, but it does inflect for number, and it also specifies that it does refer to a person:\n\n\"Quien\" is particularly common as the object of a proposition when the clause is non-defining, but is also possible in defining clauses:\n\n\"Donde\" is ultimately from a combination of the obsolete adverb \"onde\" (\"whence\" or \"from where\") and the preposition \"de\". \"Onde\" is from Latin , which also meant \"whence\" or \"from where\", and over the centuries it lost the \"from\" meaning and came to mean just \"where\". This meant that, to say \"whence\" or \"where from\", the preposition \"de\" had to be added, and this gave \"d'onde\". The meaning of \"d'onde\" once again eroded over time until it came to mean just \"where\", and prepositions therefore had to be added once more. This gave rise to the modern usage of \"donde\" for \"where\" and \"a donde\" for \"to where\", among others. Note that all this means that, etymologically speaking, \"de donde\" is the rather redundant \"from from where\", and \"a donde\" is the rather contradictory \"to from where\". This tendency goes even further with the vulgar form \"ande\" (from \"adonde\"), which is often used to mean \"where\" as well. In the Ladino dialect of Spanish, the pronoun \"onde\" is still used, where \"donde\" still means \"whence\" or \"where from\", and in Latin America, isolated communities and rural areas retain this as well.\n\n\"Como\" is from , \"how\", the ablative of , \"what way\".\n\n\"Cuando\" is from , \"when\".\n\n\"Donde\" can be used instead of other relative pronouns when location is referred to. \"Adonde\" is a variant that can be used when motion to the location is intended:\n\n\"Como\" can be used instead of other relative pronouns when manner is referred to:\n\nNote that \"mismo\" tends to require \"que\":\n\n\"Cuando\" tends to replace the use of other relative pronouns when time is referred, usually in non-defining clauses.\n\n\nNote that just \"que\", or at the most \"en que\", is normal with defining clauses referring to time. \"En el que\" and \"cuando\" are rarer.\n\n\"Cuyo\" is the formal Spanish equivalent for the English pronoun \"whose.\" However, \"cuyo\" inflects for gender and number (\"cuyos\" (m. pl.), \"cuya\" (f. sg.), or \"cuyas\" (f. pl.)) according to the word it precedes. For example:\n\n\n\"cuyo\" in this example has changed to \"cuyas\" in order to match the condition of the following word, \"calificaciones\" (f. pl.)\n\nIn Old Spanish there were interrogative forms, \"cúyo\", \"cúya\", \"cúyos\", and \"cúyas\", which are no longer used. \"¿De quién...?\" is used instead. \n\nIn practice, \"cuyo\" is reserved to formal language. A periphrasis like \"Alejandro es un estudiante que tiene unas calificaciones siempre buenas\" is more common.\n\"Alejandro es un estudiante que sus calificaciones son siempre buenas\" can also be found even if disapproved by prescriptivists.\n\n\"Cuyo\" is from , the genitive (possessive) form of .\nRelative pronouns often have corresponding interrogative pronouns. For example:\n\n\nIn the second line, \"que\" helps to answer what \"qué\" was asking for, a definition of \"this\".\n\nBelow is a list of interrogative pronouns and phrases with the relative pronouns that go with them:\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1994. Gino Strada, one of the organisation's co-founders, serves as EMERGENCY's Executive Director.\n\nEMERGENCY has treated over 10 million patients since its inception. The organisation has active operations in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Iraq, Italy, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Uganda.\n\nEMERGENCY operates based on the premise that access to high-quality healthcare is a fundamental human right.\n\nProjects usually involve the construction, support, and operation of permanent hospitals. Gino Strada and the co-founders aim was to bring free of charge, high-quality medical and surgical assistance to war victims. Over time, their humanitarian projects assumed a broader view, with the charity now providing specialist and ongoing medical care, including maternity services and open-heart surgery, in locations that require these facilities and expertise. The Anabah Maternity Centre in Anabah, Afghanistan and the \"Salam\" Centre for Cardiac Surgery in Khartoum, Sudan, are examples of EMERGENCY's focus on tertiary level care.\n\nAlongside its medical activities, EMERGENCY promotes a culture of peace and solidarity.\n\nEMERGENCY was recognised as a Non-profit Organisation in 1998, and received jurisdictional approval as a Non-Governmental Organization in 1999. EMERGENCY has been an official partner of the United Nations Department of Public Information since 2006, and a special consultant for the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2015.\n\nEMERGENCY builds hospitals, trains local staff, and provides medical assistance to victims of war and poverty. Its vision of healthcare provision is rooted in the principles of equality, quality and social responsibility. On the basis of these values, EMERGENCY advocates that:\n\nEMERGENCY’s stated goal is to provide quality medical assistance to victims of war and poverty around the world. The organisational aim is to employ first class medical services as a means to tackle boundaries and inequalities.\n\nEMERGENCY begins operations in a specific region or country based on two major factors: the need for specialized medical assistance from the local population, and the absence of similar humanitarian projects in that given country. Once a project is initiated, specialized international personnel construct and operate high-quality facilities, as well as first aid posts, and health centres for basic medical assistance. EMERGENCY also deals with endemic diseases such as polio and malaria and provides basic health care in these circumstances, as well as establishing social development projects, not only in war-torn areas, but also in high poverty regions. Since 2005, it has worked in Italy to provide healthcare to marginalised groups and communities. All of EMERGENCY's facilities are dedicated to training local staff so that they may eventually take over the running of operations from the NGO’s international personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY builds and manages: \n\nThe aim of EMERGENCY’s humanitarian projects and missions is to transfer long-term project management to local healthcare authorities, as long as the two core aspects of EMERGENCY’s activities, high-quality and free assistance, are guaranteed. On the basis of this aim, EMERGENCY has employed thousands of local staff in the countries they operate to cover both medical and non-medical positions. The organisation provides both theoretical and practical training and EMERGENCY considers this an integral part of its programmes.\n\nEMERGENCY has been working in Afghanistan since 2000, when the organization began renovating and expanding a former nursery school in the center of the capital, Kabul, which had been destroyed by a rocket. In April 2001, this structure re-opened as a Surgical Center for victims of war and landmines. Since then, over 36,000 patients have been admitted to the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY also runs a Surgical Center in Lashkar-Gah; the only free, specialized facility in the Helmand Province and in the remote areas surrounding it with first aid posts, where wounded patients are stabilized before being transferred to the main hospital by ambulance.\n\nEMERGENCY operates two centers in the district of Anabah, Panjshir Valley: a medical-surgical center opened in 1999 and a maternity center opened in 2003. Similarly to other projects, EMERGENCY has established a network of First Aid Posts and Primary Health Clinics connected to the center.\n\nEMERGENCY currently operates two projects in Central African Republic. The Bangui Pediatric Center was built in 2009 and provides free healthcare for children up to the age of 14, 24 hours a day. The center also organizes numerous outreach programmes, including health promotion for families and training for local medical staff.\n\nEMERGENCY has been working with migrants, refugees and disadvantaged individuals in Italy since 2005. Through a network of Outpatient clinics (located in Palermo, Polistena, Marghera, Castel Volturno, Naples), the NGO has provided over 210,000 consultations.\n\nEMERGENCY also runs Mobile Clinics across Italy, which are intended to provide healthcare in places were access to public facilities is limited, including farming areas, refugee and migrant reception centres, and Roma camps. The Mobile Clinics are housed in converted buses, minivans and lorries that serve Apulia, Emilia Romagna, Sicilia, Campania, Basilicata and Calabria.\n\nEMERGENCY has been established in Iraq since 1995, primarily treating victims of landmines left over from the 1981-1988 conflict. The Sulaimaniya Rehabilitation and Social Integration Center provides physiotherapy, the fitting of prostheses for amputees, and vocational training courses.\n\nIn 2017, EMERGENCY reestablished operations at the surgical center in Erbil that it had handed over to local authorities in 2005. The decision was taken due to the hospital's proximity to the Battle for Mosul. Throughout the year, the organisation provided free medical assistance to casualties of war and underwent extensive renovations, increasing its original bed capacity. As the acute phase of fighting ended, the hospital was handed back to be run by local authorities. EMERGENCY performed 1,749 surgical operations during its intervention, mainly for bullet and shell injuries.\n\nIn light of the ongoing refugee and internal migration crisis, EMERGENCY operates healthcare clinics in refugee and IDP camps in northern Iraq.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Sierra Leone has endured a bloody civil war, causing at least 75,000 deaths, and the Ebola crisis, which began in May 2014. In response to the Ebola crisis, EMERGENCY staff were trained in containing the spread of the disease at their established surgical and pediatric center in Goderich. With the virus spreading rapidly, EMERGENCY opened an intensive care unit for Ebola patients - the only facility of its kind in Sierra Leone. As hospitals were overwhelmed, the EMERGENCY center was the only surgical and pediatric center to remain open in the entire country.\n\nEMERGENCY’s largest project in Sudan is the \"Salam\" Center for Cardiac Surgery in the capital, Khartoum. In view of the high incidence of heart disease in African countries and the lack of adequate health care standards, the \"Salam\" Center offers specialized heart surgery, with the aim of its establishment as a regional center for cardiac surgery serving the people of Sudan and the nine bordering countries: Egypt, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nThe organization also runs a free paediatric center within the Mayo Refugee camp, on the outskirts of Khartoum since December 2005, and in Port Sudan since 2011.\n\nIn 2017, construction work began on the Centre of Excellence in Paediatric Surgery in Entebbe, on the banks of Lake Victoria, 35 kilometres from the Ugandan capital Kampala.\n\nThe hospital will offer free treatment and be a referral for Ugandan patients as well as children from all over Africa in need of surgery. One of its main aims is to help reduce infant mortality in Uganda and neighbouring countries, as part of the African Network of Medical Excellence (ANME). The ANME was created in 2009 to develop free medical systems of excellent quality. The hospital in Entebbe will be the second project in the network, after the \"Salam\" Centre for Cardiac Surgery in Khartoum, Sudan.\n\n'A Culture of Peace'\n\nVolunteers, medical and non-medical staff contribute to promoting a culture of peace, solidarity, and awareness and respect of human rights.\n\nVolunteers in Italy and abroad constitute a great part of EMERGENCY's work, organising a wide range of events for the fundraising that allows the organisation to operate in various countries.\n\nInternational branches\n\nEMERGENCY has affiliates in Austria, Belgium, Hong Kong, Switzerland, UK and the USA.\n\nEMERGENCY and its founder, Gino Strada, have been awarded numerous awards for their work.\n\nOn 30 November 2015, Gino Strada received the Right Livelihood Award in Stockholm, Sweden, “for his great humanity and his ability to offer medical and surgical assistance of excellence to the victims of war and injustice, continuing to denounce the causes of war without fear.\"\n\nThe organization was awarded the \"Gold Medal for Public Health\" by the Italian government in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Dr Gino Strada and EMERGENCY were awarded the Sunhak Peace Prize in Seoul, South Korea, for treating Ebola in Sierra Leone.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1979953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979953", "title": "Fellowship of the New Life", "text": "Fellowship of the New Life\n\nThe Fellowship of the New Life was a British organisation in the 19th century, most famous for a splinter group, the Fabian Society.\n\nIt was founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson. Fellowship members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, animal rights activist Henry Stephens Salt, sexologist Havelock Ellis, feminist Edith Lees (who later married Ellis), novelist Olive Schreiner and future Fabian secretary Edward R. Pease. Future UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was briefly a member. According to MacDonald, the Fellowship's main influences were Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Fellowship published a journal called \"Seed-Time\".\n\nIts objective was \"The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all.\" They wanted to transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Many of the Fellowship's members advocated pacifism, vegetarianism and simple living, under the influence of Leo Tolstoy's ideas. But when some members also wanted to become politically involved to aid society's transformation, it was decided that a separate society, the Fabian Society, would also be set up. All members were free to attend both societies. The Fellowship of the New Life disbanded in 1898.\n\nAlthough not a member, Patrick Geddes was influenced by some of the organisation's\nideas.\n\nThomas Davidson was heavily influenced by the writings of Italian philosopher and priest Antonio Rosmini-Serbati. Upon studying and translating Rosmini's writings, Davidson began to formulate the idea that would lead to the creation of the Fellowship, that pure intelligence would lead to a better and higher society.\n\nBeginning in 1883, Davidson gave several public lectures, and slowly a small group of like-minded individuals began gathering with him for meetings at his home in Chelsea, London. Between 1881 and 1885, Thomas Davidson held small meetings with this group of intellectuals. These meetings were designed to incorporate people who held similar ideals as Davidson, and to form a small society promoting the reorganisation of individual life. This reorganisation would then lead to slow progress towards a higher overall form of human society. Davidson was much more interested in discussion and meetings about this goal than scientific study or speculation.\n\nDavidson was a major proponent of a structured philosophy about religion, ethics, and social reform. He was a man full of ideas and wanted these ideas to see the light of day through his new society. Maurice Adams, one of the first members of the Fellowship, wrote of Davidson \" 'Intellectual Honesty' was his watchword, and what he had perhaps most at heart.\"\n\nAt a meeting on 16 November 1883, a summary of the society's goals was drawn up by Maurice Adams:\n\"We, recognising the evils and wrongs that must beset men so long as our social life is based upon selfishness, rivalry, and ignorance, and desiring above all things to supplant it by a life based upon unselfishness, love, and wisdom, unite, for the purpose of realising the higher life among ourselves, and of inducing and enabling others to do the same.\nAnd we now form ourselves into a Society, to be called the Guild [Fellowship] of the New Life, to carry out this purpose.\"\n\nThe initial Fellowship was composed of about nine members, one of whom was Dr. Burns Gibson. He proposed a set of principles that took the form of a resolutions list. At one meeting of the Fellowship, the \"Vita Nuova\" was created and adopted by the group's members. This basic document formed the core set of beliefs held by the society. This is as the document appears in its original form, as seen in the \"Memorials of Thomas Davidson\":\n\nVita Nuova\n\nEdward Carpenter (29 August 1844 – 28 June 1929) was a founding member of the Fellowship of the New Life and was at the first meeting in 1883. He was also one of the founders of the Fabian Society, the Labour Party and one of the most well-known people of the century. He was an English poet, socialist philosopher, anthologist, and early gay rights activist. He was interested in the main ideas of the Fellowship, including politics, sexual radicalism and the works of Henry Havelock Ellis.\n\nHavelock Ellis was present when the Fellowship of the New life was founded in London in 1883. There is no record of his contributions to discussion, although his participation in the organisation increased after the formation of the Fabian Society.\n\nEdith Ellis was the first woman served in secrete of the Fellowship of the New Life in 1887. She was a lecturer, writer, secretary and general factotum of Fellowship house, an experiment in communal living in which the ideals of the Fellowship of the new life were to be made manifest in Doughty. Before she joined, she was active in a number of cultural and political enterprises, but it was joining the Fellowship that earned her notability.\n\nThe Fabian Society, established on 4 January 1884, was a branch of Thomas Davidson's Fellowship of the New Life. The Society was named after Fabius Cunctator, a suggestion by Frank Podmore, because of Fabius' successful policy of gradual change that the society favored. The first meeting included well-known people in the socialist cause, including J. Hunter Watts, Percival Chubb, Frank Podmore, Edward Pease, Hubert Bland, Dr. Burns-Gibson, and Frederick Keddell, and although the society was a branch of the Fellowship of the New Life, Thomas Davidson shared no sympathies with Fabianism.\n\nThe Fabian Society had a more socialist movement than the Fellowship; however, it still had the individual as their base and starting point. It was geared more towards the external ideal rather than an inward one. Edward Pease said that the purpose of Fabianism was to reconstruct society to secure general welfare and happiness. Unlike the Fellowship the Fabian Society was more political and public, and their political section was influenced by Karl Marx and the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Havelock Ellis says about the society: \"an attempt to be more practical, and definitely more socialistic.\"\n\nThe Fabian Society's basis was to promote the transfer of land and capital to the State, equality of citizenship of men and women, and having public authority instead of private for the education and support of children. The resolutions of the Society were written by Frederick Keddell, the first secretary of the Fabian Society.\n\nThe Fellowship of the New Life was dissolved in 1898, but the Fabian Society grew to become a preeminent academic society in the United Kingdom. Another group organised the name of Fabian society by the center of the founder Sidney and Beatrice Webb. After that, many of Fabians participated in the formation of England's Labour Party in 1900. The party's constitution, written by Sidney Webb, borrowed heavily from the founding documents of the Fabian Society. As seen in the Labour Party Foundation Conference in 1900, the Fabian Society claimed 861 members and sent one delegate.\n\nThe Fabian society grew throughout 1930–1940 over many countries under the British rule, and many future leaders of these countries were influenced by the Fabians during their struggles for independence from the British. These leaders included India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Obafemi Awolowo, who later became the premier of Nigeria's defunct Western Region, and the founder of Pakistan, Barrister Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of Singapore, had a political philosophy strongly influenced by the Fabian Society. Even in the 21st century, the Fabian Society's influence is felt through Labour Party leaders such as former prime ministers of Great Britain, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\n\n"}

{"id": "1979964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979964", "title": "Spanish nouns", "text": "Spanish nouns\n\nThe Spanish language has nouns that express concrete objects, groups and classes of objects, qualities, feelings and other abstractions. All nouns have a conventional grammatical gender. Countable nouns inflect for number (singular and plural). However, the division between uncountable and countable nouns is more ambiguous than in English.\n\nAll Spanish nouns have one of two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine (mostly conventional, that is, arbitrarily assigned). Most adjectives and pronouns, and all articles and participles, indicate the gender of the noun they reference or modify.\n\nIn a sentence like \"Large tables are nicer\", the Spanish equivalent, \"Las mesas grandes son más bonitas\", must use words according to the gender of the noun. The noun, \"mesa\" (\"table\"), is feminine in Spanish. Therefore, the article must be feminine too, and so \"la\" instead of \"el\", is required. However, \"mesas\" is plural here, so we need \"las\" rather than \"la\". The two adjectives, whether next to the noun or after the verb, have to \"agree\" with the noun as well. \"Grande\" is a word which is invariable for gender, so it just takes a plural marker: \"grandes\". \"Bonito\" is a word that can agree for both gender and number, so we say \"bonitas\" to go with \"mesas\". A student of Spanish must keep in mind all these features when making sentences.\n\nIn general, most nouns that end in \"-a\", \"-ción\" / \"-sión\" and \"-ad\" are feminine; the rest of the nouns, which usually end in \"-o\" or a consonant, are masculine.\n\nNouns can be grouped in the following categories:\n\nNouns ending in \"-o\" are masculine, with the notable exception of the word \"mano\" (\"hand\") and a few words, which are reduced forms of longer words: \"foto\" (\"photo\") from \"fotografía\", and \"moto\" (\"motorcycle\") from \"motocicleta\"; \"-a\" is typically feminine, with notable exceptions; other vowels and consonants are more often than not masculine, but many are feminine, particularly those referring to women (\"la madre\") or ending in \"-ción/sión\", \"-dad/tad\", \"-ez\" (\"la nación, la televisión, la soledad, la libertad, la vejez\").\n\nA small set of words of Greek origin and ending in \"-ma\", \"-pa\", or \"-ta\" are masculine: \"problema\" (\"problem\"), \"lema\" (\"lemma, motto\"), \"tema\" (\"theme, topic\"), \"sistema\" (\"system\"), \"telegrama\" (\"telegram\"), \"poeta\" (\"poet\"), \"planeta\" (\"planet\"), etc.\n\nWords ending in \"-ista\" referring to a person can generally be either gender: \"el artista, la artista\", \"the artist, the female artist\". The same is true of words ending in \"-ante\" or \"-ente\", though sometimes separate female forms ending in \"-a\" are used.\n\nWords taken from foreign languages may:\n\nPeople's names agree with the sex of the person, even if they appear to be the opposite:\n\nUsage for places varies. You can choose between making them:\n\nWith examples like New York, the \"Nueva\" is a fixed part of the name and so cannot be made masculine, but New Mexico is translated as \"Nuevo México\" and considered masculine, since México is a masculine noun.\n\nRivers are masculine because of the underlying masculine noun \"río\". The ancient Roman belief that rivers (\"amnes\") were male gods may also influence this. Locally, a few rivers may be feminine, but the masculine is always safe and correct.\n\nWhile Spanish is generally regarded to have two genders, its ancestor, Latin, had three. The transition from three genders to two is mostly complete; however, vestiges of a neuter gender can still be seen. This was noted by Andrés Bello in his work on the grammar of Latin American Spanish.\n\nMost notably, this is seen in pronouns like \"esto\", \"eso\", \"aquello\", and \"ello\", which are the neuter forms of \"este\", \"ese\", \"aquel\", and \"él\", respectively. These words correspond with English \"this\", \"that\", \"that\" (more common than \"aquello\"), and \"it\". Additionally the word \"lo\", while usually masculine, can be considered neuter in some circumstances. It can also be used in the place of \"el\" to be a neutral form of the article \"the\", as in \"lo mismo\", \"the same\". Bello also notes that words such as \"nada\", \"poco\", \"algo\", and \"mucho\" can be used as neuters in some contexts.\n\nNeuter forms such as \"esto\" were preserved because unlike most nouns in Latin, the difference between masculine and neuter for these pronouns did not depend on a final consonant. For example, most second declension Latin neuter singulars in the nominative case ended in \"-um\", the non-neuter counterpart often ending in \"-us\". When the final consonants in these endings are dropped, the result is \"-u\" for both; this became \"-o\" in Spanish. However, a word like Latin \"iste\" had the neuter \"istud\"; the former became \"este\" and the latter became \"esto\" in Spanish.\n\nAnother sign that Spanish once had a grammatical neuter exists in words that derive from neuter plurals. In Latin, a neuter plural ended in \"-a\", and so these words today in Spanish are interpreted as feminine singulars and take singular verb forms; however, they do express some notion of a plural.\n\nSpanish has two grammatical numbers: singular and plural. The singular form is the lemma (the form found in dictionaries or base form), and the plural of the majority of words is formed by adding \"-s\" if the lemma ends in an unstressed vowel or stressed \"-é\", or \"-es\" if it ends with a consonant or stressed vowel other than \"-é\". Note that final \"-y\" in words like \"rey\", though phonetically a vowel, counts as a consonant (\"rey\" → \"reyes\"). The addition of \"-es\" to certain nouns produces changes in the placement of stress, thereby affecting the presence of accent marks (\"canción\" → \"canciones\", \"bongó\" → \"bongoes\" but \"rubí\" → \"rubíes\"), and causes a spelling change in stems ending in \"-c\", \"-g\" and \"-z\" (\"lápiz\" → \"lápices\", \"frac\" → \"fraques\"). Words ending in an unstressed vowel followed by \"-s\" or \"-x\" are unchanged in the plural.\n\nThe masculine gender is inclusive and is used for plural forms of groups of mixed gender (literally or otherwise): \"los niños\", grammatically masculine, may mean \"the children\" or \"the boys\". The feminine gender is exclusive in the plural: \"las niñas\" = \"the little girls\". When male sex needs to be shown exclusively in the plural, phrases such as \"los niños varones\" are used. Feminists (and their satirists) try to reverse the pattern with phrases such as \"las personas humanas jóvenes varones\" (\"the young male human people\").\n\nSome words are formally always grammatically plural: \"pantalones\" \"trousers\", \"tijeras\" \"scissors\". In many dialects, however, these words are taken to be semantic plurals, and their singular forms are used instead: \"pantalón\", \"tijera\".\n\nIn expressions with an indefinite determiner, singular forms are used (unlike English, where \"some\" and \"any\" tend to modify plural nouns).\n\n\nForms of \"ninguno\" (\"no\") always take singular noun phrases, even where plurality might be intended:\n\nThe determiner \"cualquiera\" has a plural form (\"cualesquiera\"), but it is never used outside formal or technical contexts.\n\nA very productive set of suffixes can be added to existing nouns and adjectives to form new Spanish nouns. This usually just slightly modifies the meaning, but sometimes it creates something new entirely.\n\nThe most common subset of such suffixes are the diminutives, which convey the idea of smallness, delicateness, etc. (also for endearing terms). The most common diminutive in Spanish is \"-it-\". It is added to the root of the noun, and in actual usage, it takes the proper agreement for gender and number.\n\n\nIn other cases, this ending can be pejorative or belittling.\n\nWhen the word does not end in a vowel, \"-it-\" becomes \"-cit-\" for diminutives if the word ends in something other than an unstressed \"-o\" or \"-a\". Agreement marks are added to it according to the gender and number:\n\n\nThis is slightly modified when the base word ends in \"z\". Because \"z\" and soft \"c\" are the same sound in Spanish, an epenthetic \"e\" is inserted (notice the orthographic change): \"pez\" → \"pececito\" / \"pecezote\". There is nothing fixed when the base ends in other consonants: \"azúcar\" → \"azuquítar\" or \"azuquita\" / \"azucota\".\n\nWhen words end in \"-s\" or \"-te\", there are varied approaches.\n\nThe choice of diminutive is often a mark of regional dialects and influence of coexistent Romance languages. Educated speakers who would use \"-ito\" / \"-ita\" or no diminutive at all in more formal speech may use local forms when they want a friendlier or more colourful way of expressing themselves, sometimes borrowing another region's diminutive.\n\nSo, instead of the standard \"-ito\", you could find:\n\nIn fossilised forms, these can be found in standard words, such as \"puerta\" → \"portillo\", \"burro\" → \"borrico\", \"Venecia\" → \"Venezuela\", \"paño\" → \"pañuelo\", \"calle\" → \"calleja\" → \"callejuela\" etc.\n\nSometimes different suffixes are used for variety when more than one is used at once:\n\nAs well as being an Andalusian (especially Seville) alternative to \"-ito\", the suffix \"-illo\" is also a special diminutive with a nuance of \"a funny sort of...\". It is also used to create new nouns:\n\nAn example of the same phenomenon, but using an augmentative, is \"-ón\":\n\nAnother suffix that can either denote \"a blow with\" or be an augmentative is \"-azo\":\n"}

He left school early and worked in the London offices of \"The Spectator\" magazine as an office boy. Later, he joined the Keystone Press Agency. During the Second World War, he served with the Submarine Service of the Royal Navy.\n\nWhen the war ended, he returned to the Keystone Agency and travelled all over Europe as a freelance reporter. It was during one of these trips that he came up with the idea for his first thriller, \"The Night of Wenceslas\" (1960). The novel is set in Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, and tells the story of young Nicolas Whistler, a 24-year-old Londoner whose business trip to Prague goes horribly awry. \"The Night of Wenceslas\" was an instant success, inviting favourable comparisons with such luminaries as Eric Ambler. Davidson became one of the handful of living writers to have their first novel appear in a green Penguin jacket. The book won the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award (the top prize for crime and spy fiction in Britain) as well as the Authors' Club First Novel Award. It was filmed as \"Hot Enough for June\" (1964), with Dirk Bogarde in the role of Whistler.\n\nHis second novel \"The Rose of Tibet\" (1962) was equally well received. \"A Long Way to Shiloh\" (1966) won Davidson his second Gold Dagger, and he achieved a third with \"The Chelsea Murders\" (1978). \"The Chelsea Murders\" was also adapted for television as part of Thames TV's \"Armchair Thriller\" series in 1981.\n\nDavidson then went into an extended hiatus after the publication of \"The Chelsea Murders\". He was not to write another thriller for the next sixteen years. \"Kolymsky Heights\" appeared in 1994 to international acclaim.\n\nDavidson never quite managed to fulfil his early promise to become a major figure in British spy fiction, although his best novels are of high quality. In 2001, he was awarded the CWA's Cartier Diamond Dagger lifetime achievement award, for making \"a significant contribution to crime fiction published in the English language\".\n\nDavidson wrote a number of children's novels under the pseudonym David Line. \"Run For Your Life\" is an example.\n\nLionel Davidson died on 21 October 2009 in north London after a long illness. Davidson’s first wife, the former Fay Jacobs, died in 1988.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are social justice activists, all women old enough to be grandmothers, who dress up in clothes that mock stereotypes of older women, and sing songs at protests. They typically write the lyrics themselves, putting their political messages to the tunes of well-known songs. Their activism includes peace and environmental causes.\n\nThe first group started in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, over the winter of 1986/87. They originally called themselves \"NERT—Nuclear Emergency Response Team\". The members believed the presence of US Navy nuclear-powered ships' presence in Victoria Harbour posed potential health and environmental risks to the city.\n\nIn May 2005, a California chapter of the Raging Grannies was allegedly spied upon by a unit of the California National Guard after it organized a Mother's Day anti-war rally. California State Senator Joe Dunn launched an investigation and the intelligence unit was subsequently shut down.\n\nIn July 2005, five members of the group were charged with trespassing after they attempted to enlist at a US Army recruiting center in Tucson, Arizona. A spokesperson for the group said they wanted to enlist and be sent to Iraq so that their children and grandchildren could come home. A group also went to New York City, where they were arrested for allegedly blocking access to a recruitment center in Times Square; on April 28, 2006, they were acquitted of all charges.\n\nThe Action League of the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula, as the group is known in the Bay Area, was the subject of the 2009 video documentary \"Raging Grannies\".\n\nThe Raging Grannies were also part of the \"March against Monsanto\" protest on May 25, 2013, to protest against genetically modified foods.\n\nThe original Grannies were honoured on their 30th anniversary with a display at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, MB.\n\nAt least two films, Granny Power and Two Raging Grannies, and multiple academic articles talk about the Raging Grannies. They state and show how they challenge stereotypical conceptions about activism and aging (the grannies did not grow more conservative as they aged, for example). There are two books about them: Off Our Rockers, by Alison Acker and Betty Brightwell, and The Raging Grannies: Wild Hats, Cheeky Songs and Witty Actions for a Better World.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Riga Town Hall (\"Rīgas rātsnams)\" at the Town Hall Square (\"Rātslaukums\") in the very heart of Riga.\n\nThe Riga City Council consisting of 60 councilors who are elected every 4 years is established on the basis of party factions.The work of the Riga City Council is organized by the Chairman, Deputy Mayor (both offices vacant since 25 February 2020), the Presidium, City Executive Director, District Executive Directors and the staff of municipal institutions and enterprises.\n\nThe Presidium of the Riga City Council consists of the Chairman of the Riga City Council and the representatives delegated by the political parties or party blocks elected to the City Council.\n\nIn February 2020 the City Council headed by Oļegs Burovs was dissolved by the Saeima and the President of Latvia, following three successive council meetings at which a quorum was not obtained and due to the failure to provide autonomous functions of a municipality established in the Waste Management Law. Snap elections were announced to be held on 25 April 2020 and an interim administration of three members headed by Edvīns Balševics, State Secretary of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development (), was appointed on February 25th. The election was later postponed to 6 June 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe heads of Riga, representing the town inhabitants, were mentioned in documents already in 1210. It is unknown when the first town council was formed, but the members of the town council took part in signing treaties in Riga in 1225.\n\nIn the 13th century the town council governed the town and acted as legislature, but in the 14th century – also as a judicial authority. At the same time the town council managed the town protection problems, imposed taxes, represented the interests of Riga’s inhabitants in international relations, signed agreements and appointed ambassadors. However, a communal assembly of Riga inhabitants preserved a great role in settling important and extraordinary problems. In the first half of the 13th century the councilmen of the town council were elected for one year, but at the end of the century already the town council itself selected successors to councilmen posts. The post of councilman position actually became a lifelong post.\n\nThe rights of the town council were restricted after Riga became subordinate to the King of Poland and Lithuania, Stefan Báthory (1581).\n\nDisagreements between the Riga Town Council and guilds about the right of governing the town became aggravated at the end of the 16th century. It reached its culmination during the so-called “Calendar Unrests” (1584–1589), though the town council maintained its dominance. Discordance flared up again in the first half of the 17th century when guilds managed to gain support from Sweden which governed Riga at that time.\n\nAfter Riga fell into the jurisdiction of Russia (1710), it became a province center, and after the reforms of 1783, Riga’s local administration was governed by a governor- general. However, the town council, representing the interests of the German nobility, tried to preserve its influence in Riga. With alternating success it managed to do so by 1889. An administrative town reform took place in Russia in 1870, reaching also Riga in 1877.\n\nThe City Council and the City Board were formed, and the City Mayor was elected. During the Independent Republic of Latvia (1918–1940) Riga was officially recognized as the capital of Latvia (1931), with the Riga City Council governing it. After the governmental overturn of 1934, the Cabinet of Ministers became the head of the city.\n\nAfter the Soviet occupation in 1940, administrative structure of Riga was reorganized. A provisional Executive Committee was formed. In 1941, the city was divided into six districts to facilitate police surveillance and management of nationalized properties. Such a system was preserved also after World War II; from time to time the number of districts and borderlines has changed. The Deputy Council of Working People (from 1977 – People’s Deputy Council) governed Riga. It was elected once in two years (from 1979 – in 2.5). The Council elected the Executive Committee. In reality these procedures were formal, and the city administration realized decisions inspired by the totalitarian regime’s leading organs.\n\nOn May 4, 1990 the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR adopted the Declaration on Restoring Independence of the Republic of Latvia, which introduced the period of rebuilding the structure of state power and administration in Latvia, including the Riga City administration reform.\n\nThe process of restructuring started on February 15, 1990 with the laws adopted by the Supreme Council on the local governments of rural municipalities, regions, towns and cities. Pursuant to these laws the People’s Deputy Council from its members elected the Chairman of the Council, the Deputy Chairman and his/her secretary.\n\nAndris Teikmanis, representative from the Popular Front of Latvia, was elected the Chairman of the People’s Deputy Council of Riga. Under the guidance of A. Teikmanis, the People’s Deputy Council of Riga voted for using the historical coat of arms and banner of Riga - a symbolic contribution to the continuity of the city’s heritage.\n\nSimultaneously, major changes took place in the city life and in the work of the municipal structural units linked with the changes in property forms and in the formation of the city budget.\n\nThe law “On the Local Government of the Capital City Riga” passed on June 10, 1992 changed the city administration system in the very core. The Riga City Council, consisting of 60 councillors, became the largest administrative body of the city. 30 out of the 60 councillors were elected by the People’s Deputy Council of Riga from its members and the other 30 were elected by the Councils of the Riga City districts; five councillors from each district. Presidium and Executive Committee of the People’s Deputy Council of Riga were abolished and replaced by the City Board consisting of 11 members. Andris Teikmanis was elected Chairman of the Riga City Council. The district boards were established instead of executive committees, which were led by the executive directors of the districts.\n\nOn August 26, 1993 the Riga City Council passed a resolution “On the Reform of the Riga Local Government”. It suggested to the Parliament to create in Riga a one-level local government with one administrative body, i.e. Riga City Council with 60 councillors and the executive body under the Riga City Council – the Riga City Board. On May 19, 1994 the Saeima passed the law following which the Riga City Council was elected in the municipal elections of May 29, 1994.\n\nA one-level local government, the Riga City Council with 60 elected councillors, was set up in Riga. Māris Purgailis was elected the Chairman of the City Council. 11 Standing Committees were established (Finance Committee, City Development Committee, Committee for Housing Issues, Municipal Property and Privatization Committee, Environment Protection Committee, Education, Youth and Sports Committee, Culture, Arts and Religion Committee, Committee for Municipal and Transport Affairs, Social Affairs Committee and Order Committee, Committee for Matters of Foreigners and Stateless Persons).\n\nExecutive power was exercised by the Executive Director of the Riga City Council, whose deputies were also heads of departments (City Development Department, Property Department and Department of Finance). In the districts administrative functions were performed by the district boards appointed the Riga City Council; district boards were led by directors. Every district board included six departments, district commissions as well as branches of the Riga City Council directorates and departments.\n\nThe next municipal elections took place on March 9, 1997. Andris Bērziņš was elected the Chairman of the City by the new Council. On May 5, 2000 he was appointed the Prime Minister and already on May 9 the RCC elected his successor Andris Ārgalis. The RCC structure also underwent some changes. The Council had to elect the Chairman and two Deputy Chairmen from among its members. The number of standing committees was also reduced to nine (Security and Order Committee and Committee for Matters of Foreigners and Stateless Persons were abolished). Chairmen of the Committees formed the Council’s Board. The Riga City Council employs the Executive Director of the Riga City to whom executive boards of the city districts and the Maintenance Division of the RCC are subject.\n\nThe next municipal elections were held on March 11, 2001. Gundars Bojārs was elected the Chairman of the City Council, and Sergejs Dolgopolovs and Aivars Guntis Kreituss were elected Deputy Chairmen. As compared to the previous Riga City Council, the number of standing committees increased to ten, by restoring the Security and Order Committee. The Board of the City Council was replaced by the Presidium of the Riga City Council.\n\nAfter the municipal elections in 2005, Aivars Aksenoks became Chairman of the City council. Deputy chairmen were Andris Ārgalis, Jānis Birks and Almers Ludviks (the latter replaced Juris Lujāns in summer 2005). In 2007, Jānis Birks became chairmen with Jānis Dinevičs replacing him as deputy chairman.\n\nJust underneath the Riga City Council building (destroyed during World War II, rebuilt in 2003) is a narrow cobble-stone street which is home to different souvenir and flower shops, a giant cascading waterfall three stories high and the remains of an ancient tree stub unearthed during the re-construction process. A small plaque states that when this oak was growing on the banks of the River Daugava.\n\n\n"}

He attended Columbia University in Portland, Oregon, and the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1922.\n\nClark graduated from Harvard Law School in 1925 and was admitted to the bar that year. He commenced practice in Idaho at Pocatello, and was the state's assistant attorney general from 1933 to 1935.\n\nClark was elected to the U.S. House from the 2nd district of Idaho in 1934. The seat had been vacant for several months, since the untimely death of Thomas Coffin in June. Clark was re-elected in 1936, defeating his successor, newspaper publisher Henry Dworshak of Burley.\n\nClark ran for the U.S. Senate in 1938 and won the Democratic primary in August\nover incumbent James Pope of Boise, a setback for New Deal supporters. In the general election, Clark defeated Republican former state Representative Donald Callahan of Wallace. Six years later, he was defeated for renomination in the 1944 Democratic primary by Glen H. Taylor of Pocatello.\n\nClark vied to reclaim his Senate seat in 1950 and defeated Taylor in the primary, as Taylor became the third consecutive incumbent of that Senate seat to lose in the Democratic primary. In the general election in November, Clark lost to Republican state Senator Herman Welker of Payette, as all four congressional seats (two House, two Senate) went to Republicans. Welker aligned himself in the Senate with the infamous Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin and lost his re-election bid in 1956 to 32 year-old Frank Church of Boise, who served four terms.\n\nAfter losing to Welker, Clark resumed the practice of law in Boise and Washington, D.C..

The duo consists of rappers Sonny Cheeba (Salahadeen Wilds) and Geechi Suede (Saladine Wallace). The duo is perhaps best known for their 1997 hit \"Luchini AKA This Is It\".\n\nInitially signed with Profile Records, Camp Lo made their first appearance in 1996 on \"The Great White Hype\" soundtrack, with their single, \"Coolie High\". The smooth party song was a minor hit, peaking at #25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Rap Singles chart. Their first major exposure came with the release of their second single, the upbeat, horn-driven \"Luchini\", otherwise known as \"This Is It\". The song became a crossover hit in 1997, breaking into the Top 50 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and reaching the top 5 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The track peaked at #74 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1997. The duo released their debut album \"Uptown Saturday Night\" in January 1997. The effort was widely acclaimed, praised for its accessible content and smooth, funk- and jazz-inspired production.\n\nThe majority of the album was produced by Ski, famous for his work with Jay-Z. Guest appearances were provided by De La Soul's Trugoy and Digable Planets' Butterfly. The album's 1970s styled content was influential on a number of artists within the next few years after its release, like Will Smith, who enlisted Camp Lo for an appearance on his top-selling \"Big Willie Style\" album. Also in 1997, they appeared on Oran \"Juice\" Jones' single \"Poppin' That Fly\". They collaborated with De La Soul in 2000, on the song \"So Good\" from the \"Hip Hop 101 Compilation\". They finally returned with another album in 2002, titled \"Let's Do It Again\". This effort was not nearly as well-received as their debut, and was met with mediocre reviews and sales. Shortly after the album's release, Aesop Rock enlisted the duo to appear on his album \"Bazooka Tooth\", exposing them to fans of the underground Definitive Jux label. In 2007, the duo returned with \"Black Hollywood\" after a five-year hiatus from their previous release.\n\nIn April 2008, Camp Lo signed with SRC/Universal Records and changed its name to the Lo, on the recommendation from DJ Mr. Cee. The duo released a new single titled \"Lumdi\", produced by Korleon. They also confirmed a 2011 release for a new collaboration album with Pete Rock, as they form their new group '80 Blocks From Tiffanys'.\n\nIn 2012, Geechi Suede collaborated with TheeKIDICARUS on a song \"Ask About Me\" where TheeKIDICARUS would produce the track.\n\nIn 2013, Geechi Suede was featured on the song \"21st Century\" from \"#TheRevival\", a compilation album by Philly-based rappers/producers Franz Kafka and The TradeMark Experience.\n\nIn May 2015, Camp Lo released a song titled \"Black Jesus\" via 2DOPEBOYZ in anticipation for their 5th album titled \"Ragtime Hightimes\".

{"id": "1979993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979993", "title": "Spanish adjectives", "text": "Spanish adjectives\n\nSpanish adjectives are similar to those in most other Indo-European languages. They are generally postpositive, and they agree in both gender and number with the noun they modify. \n\nSpanish adjectives can be broadly divided into two groups: those whose lemma (the base form, the form found in dictionaries) ends in \"-o\", and those whose lemma does not. The former generally inflect for both gender and number; the latter generally inflect just for number. \"Frío\" (\"cold\"), for example, inflects for both gender and number. When it is used with a masculine singular noun, the masculine singular form \"frío\" (the lemma) is used. When it is used with a feminine singular noun, it becomes \"fría\"; \"-a\" is generally the feminine singular ending for adjectives that inflect for gender. When it is used with a masculine plural noun, it becomes \"fríos\", and when it is used with a feminine plural noun, it becomes \"frías\"; \"-s\" is the plural marker for both the masculine and feminine with adjectives that inflect for gender. Thus:\n\n\nAdjectives whose lemma does not end in \"-o\", however, inflect differently. These adjectives almost always inflect only for number. \"-s\" is once again the plural marker, and if the lemma ends in a consonant, the adjective takes \"-es\" in the plural. Thus:\n\n\nThis division into two groups is a generalization, however. There are many examples, such as the adjective \"español\" itself, of adjectives whose lemmas do not end in \"-o\" but nevertheless take \"-a\" in the feminine singular as well as \"-as\" in the feminine plural and thus have four forms: in the case of \"español, española, españoles, españolas\". There are also adjectives that do not inflect at all (generally words borrowed from other languages, such as the French \"beige\" (also Hispanicised to \"beis\")).\n\nSpanish adjectives are very similar to nouns and are often interchangeable with them. Bare adjectives can be used with articles and thus function as nouns where English would require nominalization using the pronoun \"one(s)\". For example:\n\n\nMasculine singular adjectives can also be used with the neuter article \"lo\" to signify \"the [adjective] thing, the [adjective] part\". Thus:\n\n\nThe only inflectionally irregular adjectives in Spanish are those that have irregular comparative forms, and only four do.\n\nSpanish adjectives are generally postpositive, that is, they come after the noun they modify. Thus \"el libro largo (\"the long book\"), \"la casa grande (\"the big house\"), \"los hombres altos\" (\"the tall men\"), etc. There are, however, a small number of adjectives, including all ordinal numerals as well as words such as \"otro\" (\"other\") and \"todo\" (\"all\"), that must be placed before the noun they modify. There are also a small number that can be placed both before and after the noun and that change meaning according to that positioning, and some adjectives, especially those that form something of a fixed phrase with the noun (e.g. \"oscura noche\" (\"dark night\"), \"alta montaña\" (\"high mountain\")), can be placed before or after the noun with little change in meaning.\n\nA small number of adjectives have apocopic forms: forms in which the final sound or two is dropped in certain environments. They are:\n\nApocopic forms are used even when the word does not come immediately before the noun: \"algún fresco pan\" (\"some fresh bread\"), \"el primer gran árbol\" (\"the first big tree\"), \"ningún otro hombre\" (\"no other man\"), etc. In the case of \"grande\", which is the only apocopic adjective with regular comparative and superlative forms (\"más grande\" and \"el más grande\", respectively), the comparative and superlative apocopate in the same manner as the positive: \"la más gran casa\" but \"la casa más grande\", \"el más gran coche de los dos\" but \"el coche más grande de los dos\", etc. If a conjunction intervenes between the adjective and the noun, however, apocopic forms are not used: \"esta grande y bella casa\" (\"this big and beautiful house\"), \"el primero o segundo día\" (\"the first or second day\"), etc.\n\nSeveral adjectives change meaning depending on their position: either before or after the noun. They are:\n\nComparatives are normally expressed with the adverbs \"más\" (\"more\") and \"menos\" (\"less\") followed by the adjective; the object of comparison is introduced with the particle \"que\" (\"than\"). For example, \"X es más grande que Y\" (\"X is bigger/greater than Y\"). Superlatives (in the cross-linguistic, semantic sense) are also expressed with the adverbs \"más\" and \"menos\", but this time with a definite article preceding the noun: \"la persona más interesante\" (\"the most interesting person\"); the object of comparison is introduced with the preposition \"de\" (\"of\"). The adjectives \"bueno\" (\"good\"), \"malo\" (\"bad\"), \"joven\" (\"young\"), and \"viejo\" (\"old\") have irregular comparative forms: \"mejor\" (\"better\"), \"peor\" (\"worse\"), \"menor\" (\"younger\"), and \"mayor\" (\"older\"), respectively. \"Mejor\" and \"peor\" are placed before the nouns they modify: \"la mejor cosa\", (\"the best thing\"), \"el peor libro\" (\"the worst book\"), etc.\n\nBecause the definite article is, along with \"más\" or \"menos\", the superlative marker, the comparative is grammatically indistinguishable from the superlative when used with it; an additional qualifier phrase such as \"de los dos\" (\"of the two\") must therefore be used to indicate that the adjective is the comparative and not the superlative.\n\nInstead of putting \"muy\", \"very\" before an adjective, one can use a special form called the superlative to intensify an idea. This consists of the suffix \"-ísimo\". This form derives from the Latin superlative, but no longer means \"the most ...\", which is expressed in the ways explained above. Nevertheless, the name is retained for historical reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying \"-ísimo\" to nouns is not common, but there is the famous case of \"Generalísimo\".\n\nAs in English and other languages influenced by it, a teenspeak superlative can be formed by the prefix \"super-\", or sometimes \"hiper-\", \"ultra-\", \"re-\" or \"requete-\". They can also be written as adverbs separate from the word.\n\nMany terms suffixed in -\"dor\", -\"dora\" are nouns formed by other nouns or verbs (equivalent to English \"noun + er\" or \"verb + er\"). Usually adjectives correspond to \"verb + dor/a\" (equivalent to English \"verb + ing\") derived from the three conjugations:\n\nExamples:\n\nAn alternative form, -\"sitor\", -\"sitora\", corresponds to verbs ending in -\"poner\":\n\nExample:\n\nAnother alternative, -\"tor\", -\"tora\", corresponds to verbs ending in -\"ducir\" and -\"venir\":\n\nExample:\n"}

{"id": "1980006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980006", "title": "Spanish determiners", "text": "Spanish determiners\n\nThe Spanish language uses determiners in a similar way to English. The main differences are that Spanish determiners inflect for gender (masculine/feminine, with some instances of vestigial neuter) and always inflect for number as well.\n\nThe Spanish has three kinds of demonstrative, whose use typically depends on the distance (physical or metaphorical) between the speaker and the described entity, or sometimes it depends on the proximity to the three grammatical persons.\nOld English also used to have a three-way system: \"this hill (here)\", \"that hill (there)\" or \"yon hill (yonder)\" — in Spanish, \"esta colina\", \"esa colina\", \"aquella colina\". Standard English lost the third level, so that the \"that, there\" series covers the ground of \"yon, yonder\".\n\n\"Este\" usually refers to something near the speaker (the first person). \"Ese\" usually refers to something nearer the listener (the second person). \"Aquel\" usually refers to something away from both the speaker and the listener.\n\nThe demonstrative determiners can also be used as pronouns, with the addition of the neutral singular forms \"esto\", \"eso\", \"aquello\".\n\nA similar three-way system of demonstratives is found in Portuguese as well as Slavic languages, Japanese and Turkish.\n\nThe definite article in Spanish, corresponding to \"the\", is \"el\". It inflects for gender and number as follows:\nThus:\n\n\nThe usually masculine form \"el\" is used instead of \"la\" before feminine nouns that begin with a stressed \"a\" (or rarely, \"au\") sound (as well as, in principle, \"ai\", but such words are almost never found in practice):\n\n\"La\" is used, however, when \"el\" would imply a masculine noun:\n\nFeminine \"el\" is never used, however, before feminine adjectives that begin with a stressed \"a\":\n\n\"Azúcar\" is a very special case. Its \"a-\" is unstressed, and yet it usually takes \"el\" even when feminine; in addition, \"azúcar\" can be of both genders in Spanish (other words with double gender are \"sal\" (salt), \"mar\" (sea) and \"sartén\" (frying pan)):\n\nFeminine \"el\" does not have the same origin as the masculine \"el\". The latter is from the Old Castilian \"ele\", whereas the former is from \"ela\", just as \"la\" is.\n\nThere is also a neuter article that is used before adjectives and makes them work like nouns:\n\nThe indefinite article in Spanish, corresponding to \"a/an\", is \"un\". It inflects for gender and number as follows:\n\nThus:\n\nNear synonyms of \"unos\" include \"unos cuantos\", \"algunos\" and \"unos pocos\".\n\nThe same rules that apply to feminine \"el\" apply to \"una\" and \"un\":\n\nAs in English, the plural indefinite article is not always required:\n\nThese are often known as possessive or genitive determiners. They are used before the noun they possess (and before the rest of the whole noun phrase, for example when an adjective precedes the noun). They inflect for number and in some cases gender as well.\n\nFor example:\n\nGiven the ambiguous meaning of \"su/s\", this is often avoided, and replaced by other forms that clearly state who owns the thing in question. So sentences like the following can be heard:\n\n\nOr even:\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nDialectal variation:\n\nDemonstrative pronouns can be combined with possessives as follows:\n\nStrictly speaking, the presence of the first determiner means that the possessive must be interpreted as an adjective rather than a determiner. Note however that the long adjectival form (\"mío\", \"tuyo\", \"suyo\", etc.), which is identical to the corresponding possessive pronoun, is not used in this construction, which is rather uncommon.\n\nIt is also possible to use the long adjectival form. In this case, it goes after the noun:\n\nThere are many more words that can be used as determiners in Spanish. They mostly end in \"-o\" and have the usual four forms (\"-o, -a, -os, -as\") to agree with the noun.\n\n"}

{"id": "1980010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980010", "title": "Virtual Magic Kingdom", "text": "Virtual Magic Kingdom\n\nVirtual Magic Kingdom, also known as VMK, was a massively multiplayer online game developed by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and Sulake Corporation and published by The Walt Disney Company. It was a virtual representation of the Disneyland style theme parks, containing areas and minigames which were based on real park scenery and attractions. It was launched as part of the Happiest Celebration on Earth promotional campaign to commemorate fifty years of Disney theme parks.\n\nThe beta version opened publicly on May 23, 2005, with three virtual lands to explore: Main Street USA, Fantasyland, and Adventureland. This \"beta\" designation was removed on June 27. The Tomorrowland game area was made available on October 5, and Frontierland opened on December 12. The rest of Tomorrowland opened on April 4, 2006, and New Orleans Square, the final land added, opened on January 8, 2007.\n\nVMK initially launched as an attachment to the Disneyland 50th-anniversary celebration, without long-term intentions, but it gained popularity and eventually became a long-term venture on its own. The target audience of the game was children between the ages of 8 and 14, although VMK was designed to be enjoyed by guests of all ages. Due to the young age of the game's target users, it was patrolled by paid staff who watched out for inappropriate behavior and language. Because of the need for human monitors, the time that the game was open had to be limited; it was open to the public daily between 7:00am–10:00pm PST (10:00am–1:00am EST, 3:00pm–6:00am UTC).\n\nOn May 21, 2008, the Virtual Magic Kingdom game was closed by Disney. Many fans asked Disney if VMK was going to reopen. This prompted Disney to post a message on the VMK homepage that the game was a promotion, and was closed, and that there were \"no plans\" to reopen VMK in any form. The VMK homepage now redirects to the main Disney games site. However, in 2013 a fan made reincarnation of the game “MyVMK” was released and has remained open for play since.\n\nThe Virtual Magic Kingdom consisted of \"Disney Lands\", each depicted in isometric projection, and each with a distinct theme.\n\nNo more than 15 characters could occupy a room at any time. If a player tried to enter a guest room which already contained fifteen characters, he or she would be put into a queue to wait to enter. A player could request a free \"VMK pass\" if there were more than five people in the queue for a room; this allowed him or her to walk around freely in other rooms until it was his or her turn to enter. The public rooms all had multiple \"instances\", named after compass directions (such as the \"North-East-East\" instance), and each instance could have up to fifteen characters in it. When moving around the public rooms, a character would be randomly placed in an instance of a room unless the player checked the \"Advanced Mode\" box, in which they could select a specific instance for his or her character to enter.\n\nDuring October, all the rooms along Main Street were decorated for Halloween. In 2005, the decorations were left up until December; in 2006 and 2007, Christmas décor appeared immediately after Halloween.\n\nPlayers whose characters met in the same room at the same time could become \"friends\": one issued an invitation to the other, and if the other accepted, then each player would always be able to see when the other was online and in what game location, and would be able to jump instantly to the other character's location (unless blocked by a 'friends only' flag on the room, the presence of the friend's character within a game, or a 'special entrance' room). Either player could remove someone from his or her friends list at any time.\n\nWhen a player first created his or her character in the game, he or she was given one free \"guest room\", which they could name and decorate with items. If the player was creating their character in a real-life park, then they were given another room (one of each available choice), as a bonus. Several other kinds of rooms were also available; a player could purchase/get them in the game. Players could set some of their items to be movable by their guests, a feature added sometime in late 2007 or early 2008.\n\nIn-game shops sold a wide variety of items, such as posters, couches, water fountains, and rugs, which could be used to decorate guest rooms. Some of these items were sold only for a limited time, and some could only be obtained as prizes for completed quests. Pictures taken with the in-game camera could be hung on guest room walls, or put into a photo book for public view.\n\nPlayers could also create games in their rooms (as long as the games followed VMK guidelines of appropriateness), and award some of their own items to players. Among the most popular of these were \"Cute or Boot\", best described as a beauty pageant/fashion contest, \"Falling Chairs\", a game where the owner of the room dropped chairs while other players raced to them, and \"Don't Hit the Floor!\" in which a maximum of six contestants stood on boxes. Two variations of \"Cute or Boot\" were \"Dress Like Me!\", a game where players tried to dress like the game's owner, and \"Wear that hat!\", where players wore the same hat as the owner. Another popular game was \"Design a Room!\", where the owner filled rooms with items that could be moved, and the object was for players to design the best room. A less popular one was \"Survivor\", where the owner asked a question and the first person to answer it correctly wins a point.\n\nGuest room owners had the ability to remove (\"boot\") a player from their room if the player was causing problems. Players that were \"booted\" had to wait set period of time before returning to the room.\n\nIf a character was in his own room, then he or she could be found by the Guest Rooms \"search\" button (which searched on the names of room owners as well as the names of rooms). Other than this, there was no way within the game to find out whether a particular other character not on a player's friends list was online or where they were located.\n\nIn the New Orleans Square land, there was an exclusive room based on the VIP Exclusive Disney Club, located in the real New Orleans Square, Club 33. This room was used for staff events and open to some guests who had won the best guest room award.\n\nEach week, VMK staff awarded a Best Guest Room Award, Best Game Room Award, and a Best Quest Award pin to the owners of guest rooms chosen to be superlative in originality and creativity. Winners of Best Guest Room not only got the Best Guest Room Award, but they also were allowed to \"rent\" Club 33 for a party, which a VMK host helped the winner organize. Several players earned the Best Guest Room, Best Game Room, or Best Quest award more than once; the VMK staff awarded the VIP pin to these outstanding players.\n\nA player could set his or her guest rooms so that only people on his or her friends list could enter. On January 8, 2007, \"tickets\" were added; a room owner was then able to sell (for 10 credits) or trade tickets to allow entry to his or her rooms. The tickets appeared as single-use pins.\n\nIn March 2007, VMK Staff began \"Room Makeovers\", where VMK staff would go into randomly selected guest rooms, or guest rooms submitted by online players, and give the room a makeover if it was in need of one. Before and after pictures of the players' room were then posted each week on the VMK Newsletter.\n\nDuring the month of April, VMK staff awarded a 'Best Pirate Room' award because April was 'Pirate Month.' Prizes included a \"Seagull Nest Hat\", a \"Crow Barstool\" and the seat that went with it, and a \"Flaming Ransacked Window\".\n\nSome rooms were available in the Virtual Magic Kingdom from the shop button, others were available from quests, and some had limited availability built-in. Players were encouraged to get guest rooms when quests came out, because that could be the only time they would ever be available. For example, the Tron Guest Room was from a quest that was available only for a time, so players who did not finish the quest by a certain date, never received the Tron Guest Room. There were also codes for certain guest rooms.\n\nIn June 2007, \"pay-to-play\" guest/game rooms were disallowed because it was considered scamming, though games like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" were still allowed to ask for the minimum 21 credits.\n\nIn January 2008, three new guest rooms were added to Main Street: Main Street Magic Shop in Central Plaza, Main Street Magic Shop Checkers (a new game at the Magic Shop), and the Penny Arcade on Main Street.\n\nThe following minigames were available to play throughout the lands in the Virtual Magic Kingdom:\n\n\nThere were also several places in Tomorrowland where credits could be earned. In Nautilus Grotto and Shipwreck Graveyard, a player could collect shells that randomly popped up under water and receive one credit for every pearl they found. This game required the Diving Suit magic pin, which could be obtained from an in-game quest. Another place to earn credits was the Autopia Space Race and the Mars race tracks. In this game, a player drove over trophies to collect them, while also driving over gas cans to keep from running out of gas. For every trophy collected, a player received one credit. This game required one of the four available Autopia car magic pins, which could be obtained from an in-game quest. It also required an Autopia Driver's License.\n\nThe following minigames were available to play in the Tomorrowland Arcade until waterpark overlay:\n\n\nThe Virtual Magic Kingdom occasionally held special events at which prizes were given out. Special events included:\n\n\nIn-game quests involved a series of tasks for a player, such as finding a specific room or an item in the room, changing one's outfit, saying a specific word, or winning a certain number of points in a minigame. There were two types of in-game quests: 'Q Button' quests, which players could start from anywhere in the game by pressing a button marked 'Q' on the game's taskbar; and kiosk quests, which were linked to a 'quest kiosk' item owned by a particular player or staff member. Successful completion of a quest usually awarded a prize. Each character could only complete each quest once.\n\nFor the first two years of the game, there was an in-park quest program which permitted players to earn special in-game prizes at Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. These quests were mostly eliminated in mid-2007, with the exception of an activity sheet and quest which was handed out to guests waiting in line at the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage attraction at Disneyland until around January 2008.\n\nThere were fifty Hidden Mickeys in the game, appearing as mouse-eared logos embossed onto scenery in rooms. Hunting for Hidden Mickeys could be a difficult task, as they were faint and rather difficult to see, and it could take time to earn enough credits to buy film to photograph the hidden Mickeys in-game. Almost every room had at least one, and some contained two.\n\nCredits and pins were awarded after finding certain numbers of Hidden Mickeys (a Bronze Mickey pin for finding ten, a Silver Mortimer pin for finding thirty, and a Gold Oswald pin and 500 credits for finding all fifty). Completing this hunt originally awarded a printable PDF coupon with a code for the Gold Design set of items, which could be obtained by redeeming the coupon at Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom.\n\nThe locations of the Hidden Mickeys were changed on December 12, 2005. The new hunt was called \"Hidden Mickey Quest Part II\", and the new prize pins had \"Part II\" appended to their names.\n\nA new player began by registering an account at the VMK website. The player then set up a character (an avatar) and selected the character's gender and appearance (shirt, shoes, pants, hair, hat, face, and colors for skin and hair). The player chose a name for the avatar, but until the VMK staff approved the name they requested, their name was \"Guest\" followed by the number of player that they are (e.g. Guest7402548). If the name was not approved, the VMK staff would let the player create another name. The player also selected a \"guest room\", his or her own themed area which could be decorated with furniture, posters, a boat canal, train tracks, game items, or other material. One room was provided for free, and additional rooms could be purchased later with in-game credits. The player could enter a few lines of text, known as a \"signature\", which were displayed in the character's publicly visible profile. The character was then given a few tradeable items (mostly T-shirts), and was placed in the game.\n\nA player could also choose from a list of randomly selected \"adjective-adjective-noun\" names presented to him or her; if he or she chose one of these names, it did not need undergo staff approval.\n\nThere were many items. There were in-game items which were buyables. Other could be won or gained from the parks. These items included furniture, clothing, and pins. Most were tradeable, some were not.\n\nBadges were icons that appeared at the top of a player's information window and were visible to other players. Badges could not be traded.\n\n\nA character could \"wear\" up to fifteen pins so that other players could see them in his or her profile. Some pins could be purchased from shops in the game; others could only be obtained by completing in-park or in-game quests, by winning host games, or from a Non-Playable Character (NPC) such as Esmeralda.\n\nUsually a new pin was released on weekends of a certain month in the Emporium for a limited time. These pins usually cost 500 credits and were often a part of a set. For example, during October 2006 a set of Halloween themed pins came out, and a new pin was released every weekend. However, by Monday the pin was no longer available, making it high in value. The next weekend however, a new pin in the set was released and it started all over again.\n\n\"Magic pins\" could also be worn. When activated (from the magic wand icon at the bottom of the screen, or by typing the pin's magic word), they displayed a visual effect, such as the character driving a car or turning into a snowman. Each effect had a duration of only a few seconds and had to be allowed to \"recharge\" for a minute or so before another use. If a player had two or more of the same kind of magic pin, they could be combined for a longer effect and shorter delay between uses. There were also single-use magic pins which disappeared after being used once (or after a specific \"expiration date\"). Some magic pins were very expensive and only available for a short period of time; for example, the \"Turn Into Bat Magic Pin\" (only available in October) was priced at 10,000 credits.\n\nSome pins were not tradeable and could only be obtained through quests or host events. These pins included all single-use magic pins and all Tomorrowland quest pins. Any award pin, such as the best guest room award or the VIP pin, was also not tradeable. A player could check if a pin was tradeable by clicking the pin on a player's profile, which not only revealed whether a certain pin is available for trade or not, but also revealed who owned the pin and what effects (if any) the pin might have.\n\nWhen a player joined the kingdom, he or she received a pack of clothing along with a room and some furniture. Players that signed up at a Disney park sometimes received extra rewards.\n\nOccasionally, the VMK shops sold special clothing items (or entire costumes). Some of these were seasonal, and some could only be purchased during a specific weekend. These items were usually expensive; due to this and their limited availability, they soon became valuable items in trading.\n\nSome clothing items were only available to one gender. For example, boys could not have princess outfits (excluding the Princess Minnie hat), and girls could not have the Wildcats outfit.\n\nFull costumes included spacesuits, princess outfits,(came in blue, yellow, pink) Haunted Mansion dress clothes, an Expedition Everest hiking outfit, baseball uniforms, and football uniforms.\n\nCostume items included Mickey ears, and a variety of caps including baseball caps and a Sorcerer Mickey hat.\n\nA player could earn credits, purchase them in one of Disney's Parks (the game's currency) also by visiting the Disney Characters (see \"Disney Characters\" above) or by playing minigames.\n\nAnother popular way to amass credits was called \"Nedding\". It consisted of playing the Shrunken Ned's Jungle Cruise game but trying to end the game as quickly as possible by crashing repeatedly and running out of fuel. Each time the game was played it awards 20 credits, so the credits that could be gotten from this game were limited only by the length of time someone wanted to put into it.\n\nAccounts used specifically for getting credits and items, known in other games as multis, were called \"mules\" (sometimes called \"clones\"). Since the game let a player create new accounts freely, players created mules (named after the beast of burden) to enter multi-use codes and collect credits by visiting Disney Characters. Players could buy items with a mule's credits, and then trade these items from the mules to their main characters. Players who used mules were said to be \"muling\", and in the game mules were called \"done keys\" (donkeys) due to the limited vocabulary.\n\nPurchased items could be \"sold back\" for 20% of their purchase price, but some items were not able to be sold. For example, a quest kiosk could not be sold back or traded.\n\nPlayers could trade various items. Each player could put a maximum of fifteen items into a trade.\n\nClothing items that were only available for boys or girls could not be traded to the other gender. For example, a girl could not trade her princess outfit to a boy.\n\nSome players tried to take advantage of the trading window to scam other players, but most of the trading window scams were short-circuited by game developers adding confirmation notices. VMK stated that if a person agreed to all of these notices, any issues a player might have with the trade were due to their own negligence.\n\nA player could report a scammer with the \"Report\" button in the game, or by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the web site.\n\nThe game's rules were posted on the VMK web site as \"VMK Values\", which were intended to help the game stay \"a safe, non-threatening environment\" for the many players between the ages of eight and fourteen. The rules prohibited sexual or racist language, harassment, divulging personal information, and attempts to hack the system. Violations could result in a permanent ban, which prevented users from using VMK from the ISP the violation occurred on. Despite this, attempted violations were quite common, and people attempted to get around the edited speech by formulating single words out of multiple words (e.g.: saying \"I'm Tree Ears Hold\").\n\nEvery player had a report button on their profile. If one player thought of something that another player did as against the VMK values, that player could report them. The report was immediately sent to the VMK staff for review, and any necessary actions were taken against that player's account. Players could also send \"emergency\" messages to staff without clicking the report button on another player. The main reason for this was if something was wrong with the game. (e.g.: \"I logged in the morning, and all my credits were gone.\") Action would be taken against a player's account for sending false or unnecessary reports. (These were usually made in an attempt to bring a VMK staff member to their room, or in an effort for revenge.)\n\nDisney prohibited sharing personal information in the game (and its limited dictionary also added a technical obstacle to this). Disney's stated intent was to protect the safety and privacy of its members, but this also prevented members from having a legitimate way of reaching each other outside the game. Members of some Disney internet discussion forums got around this by indicating in their in-game signature a discussion board through which they could be reached.\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Disney announced that VMK would close on May 21, 2008, at 1:00 AM EST. Immediately after the press release, changes were made to prevent the creation of any new accounts.\n\nOnline petitions were created to attempt to change Disney's decision, and some players attempted to arrange a protest outside of the entrance to Disneyland, and approximately a dozen people showed up. On Thanksgiving weekend of 2008, suspicion arose when emails from VMK's server were sent out saying they were testing the player's account. These emails were proved to be false. Ultimately, these actions had no effect, and VMK was shut down as scheduled. The VMK website was updated with information to quell repeated rumors that the game would be resurrected (and at one point, provided promotional [free] subscriptions for other Disney Online games), but was taken down entirely in November 2008; the VMK URL currently directs users to the \"Games\" section of Disney.com instead of the VMK homepage.\n\nVMK has been a frequently used device in \"The Kingdom Keepers\" series, written by Ridley Pearson. It serves as a rendezvous point for the main characters, as well as a communication device as the kids venture through the Disney parks. After VMK closed down in real life, Pearson incorporated the closing into the books.\n\n"}

Its climate is subtropical, with a long (May – October) dry season (\"estio\"). Its population is mainly mestizo, but includes many people of different ethnicities . Supposedly, the city was first colonized by Jewish Conversos fleeing from Lima's Inquisition. This nucleus has been intermarrying for almost five centuries, forming a compact population linked by family connections. Since the 1990s, the indigenous majority has seized political power and most of the local elected officers are of Quechua origin.\n\nThe city has 55,374 inhabitants (2011 census) and is growing. It suffers severe problems of electricity and water supply. Water is drawn from high surface sources, mostly from the Chimborazo glacier, and is of good drinking quality. The city is known for its week-long Carnaval and for its \"Pajaro Azul\" alcoholic drink.\n\nThe city was founded by Spanish explorers in 1571, but wasn't officially recognized until November 11, 1811.

Its current CEO is Nir Sztern, who was appointed on 1 January 2012. As of June 2016, Cellcom had 2.812 million subscribers.\n\nCellcom's entry into the Israeli market caused a revolution in wireless services in the country as it offered service at rates which were a fraction of those charged by Pelephone, which until Cellcom's launch held a monopoly on cellular services in Israel. Its launch was not without problems though and during 1995, Cellcom subscribers experienced widespread service disruptions of unknown origin. After an intensive investigation the cause was finally traced to a software bug in Motorola's MicroTAC Alpha handsets – which were ubiquitous on its network at the time. Nevertheless, its attractive rates led to a huge demand for the company's services and within a few years it had accumulated over a million subscribers.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2012, it had around 3.4 million customers, the largest of the Israeli mobile providers in terms of customer base size. The vast majority of active voice clients are on its GSM network while data usage is spread across networks of different technologies..\n\nCellcom initially operated a TDMA network nationwide in the 850 MHz band but after winning tenders for GSM-1800 frequencies it began offering GSM services, and eventually sought to replace the 850 MHz TDMA frequencies it owns with standard 900 MHz GSM frequencies but Pelephone and Partner petitioned the Ministry of Communications to deny this for technical reasons. This put Cellcom at a disadvantage since though most of its users had converted to GSM, they were not able to make use of the lower frequency's better in-building penetration and greater cell reach.\n\nWith its entry into 3G wireless services, Cellcom demonstrated the first mobile video call in Israel. Since the beginning of 2006, Cellcom has been deploying a 3G UMTS-2100 network nationwide which by the end of 2007 covered than 87% of the population. Cellcom was the first in Israel to launch an HSDPA network (also called \"Generation 3.5\") nationwide.\n\nIn 2011, Cellcom began to deploy UMTS services in the 850 MHz band, employing unused capacity in that frequency range since it had very few TDMA customers remaining. The Israeli Ministry of Communications has approved Cellcom's plan to shut down the TDMA-850 network on 31 December 2011. In August 2014 Cellcom launched an LTE network in the 1800 MHz band.\n\nIn 2009 Cellcom launched an ad campaign showing Israel Defense Forces soldiers playing football across the Israeli West Bank barrier. Ahmad Tibi, an Arab-Israeli member of the Knesset, called on Cellcom to withdraw the commercial.\n\nA major service outage across the country on December 1, 2010 impacted on Cellcom's Q4 results. The company decided to refund customers with one week's worth of calls and messages although the customers never actually received their refund, says Daniel Martinez of \"The Jerusalem Post\".\n\n\n"}

The 17-year old Pinto married on 29 December 1734 to Rachel Nuñes Henriques; the couple never had any children. In 1748 Pinto helped stadholder prince William IV of Orange, sending or lending him money to defeat the French at Bergen op Zoom. In return he asked for uplifting measures against Jewish merchants forbidding them to sell clothes, gherkins or fish on the street. He proposed to open the guilds for the Jews and to send the poorest to Surinam. In 1750 he was appointed by the prince as the president of the Dutch East India Company.\n\nPinto was a man of broad learning, but did not begin to write until nearly forty-five, when he acquired a reputation by defending his co-religionists against Voltaire. In 1762 he published his \"Essai sur le Luxe\" at Amsterdam. In the same year appeared his \"Apologie pour la Nation Juive, ou Réflexions Critiques\". The author sent a manuscript copy of this work to Voltaire. Antoine Guenée reproduced the \"Apologie\" at the head of his \"Lettres de Quelques Juifs Portugais, Allemands et Polonais, à M. de Voltaire\".\n\nIn 1761 De Pinto and his brother Aron went bankrupt maybe as a result of raising loans of 6 or 6.6 million guilders for the British government, in either 1759 or 1761; his brother sold his house on Nieuwe Herengracht. De Pinto moved to Paris, where he met with James Cockburn, Lord Hertford, Mattheus Lestevenon, David Hume John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford and Denis Diderot. Then he moved to The Hague and lived in a mansion at Lange Voorhout; he and his family were invited to the palace when Mozart and his sister played. In 1767 he went to London, met with Lord Bute where he received a pension for his advice on the Treaty of Paris (1763), as the British gained influence over the French in India through his suggestion. \"He pointed out that if the British did not obtain this change, war would probably break out again.\" In 1768, Pinto sent a letter to Diderot on \"Du Jeu de Cartes\". His \"Traité de la Circulation et du Crédit\" in which \"he convinced many people that England was not on the verge of bankruptcy\", started in 1761, appeared in Amsterdam in 1771. He disagreed with Hume, Vivant de Mezague and Mirabeau. His treatise was twice reprinted, besides being translated into English by Philip Francis (politician) and into German by Carl August von Struensee. His \"Précis des Arguments Contre les Matérialistes\" was published at The Hague in 1774. Pinto published mainly in French and once in Portuguese. He seems also to have Jean-Paul Marat, whom he pushed from the stairs and ordered to leave his house. In 1776 he wrote against the American revolutionaries; he did approve the Boston Tea Party. Around 1780 he disapproved an alliance of the Dutch Republic with France.\n\nVarious authors, both contemporary and later, commented on Pinto's writings. One of them, Karl Marx, derisively referred to Pinto - whom he regarded as a major exponent of the free-market liberalism he criticized - as the \"Pindar of the Amsterdam stock exchange\" for his glorification of the Dutch financial system.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, such a delivery is difficult for the batsman to judge whether to play on the back-foot or on the front-foot. However, the distance from the batsman which is the ideal good length varies depending on how high and fast the ball bounces on a particular pitch. The pace of the bowler is also a factor, as faster bowlers will aim to pitch the ball further away from the batsman.\n\n"}

He was MP for Birmingham Hall Green from 1997 to 2010.\n\nBorn in the shipbuilding town of Port Glasgow on the River Clyde, McCabe attended the Port Glasgow High School before studying at the Moray House College (later named Moray House School of Education) in Edinburgh, where he was awarded a Diploma in Social Studies (Certificate Qualification Social Work) in 1977 and qualified as a social worker.\n\nHe worked initially as a social worker in Wolverhampton for six years from 1977, and from 1978–1982 he served as a shop steward with the National and Local Government Officers Association. In 1983, he was appointed manager of the Priory in Thatcham, providing alternatives to care and custody for young people, for Berkshire Social Services. He left the Priory in 1985 and returned to education, taking an MA in Social Work at the University of Bradford in 1986.\n\nFollowing his degree, he worked as a social services lecturer at the North East Worcestershire College in Redditch. In 1989, he became a child care worker in Solihull until 1991 when was appointed as an education adviser to the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (now called the General Social Care Council). He remained in this position until his election to the House of Commons.\n\nHe was elected as a councillor to Birmingham City Council in 1990 and served until 1998, during which time he served as the chair of the city's technical services committee (highways are its major function).\n\nMcCabe was elected as the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green at the 1997 General Election when he unseated the Conservative member Andrew Hargreaves by 8,420 votes in the Labour landslide; the first time a Labour MP held the seat.\n\nHe served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Charles Clarke in his capacity as Secretary of State for Education and Skills (2003–2004) and as Home Secretary (2004–2005). He joined the government Whips Office in 2006 as an Assistant, and from 2007 was a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury (a full Whip). He also served on various select committees, including Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee (1998–2003) and Home Affairs Select Committee (2005–2006 and 2010–2013).\n\nIn October 2006, he applied for selection to the redrawn Birmingham Selly Oak seat, which incorporated much of his existing seat. Following the announcement by Lynne Jones, the sitting member for Selly Oak, in January 2007 that she would stand down at the next election, he became the favourite to be selected for the newly drawn constituency, and was duly selected by the local Labour party. He decided not to apply for the redrawn Hall Green seat on the grounds that its boundaries were significantly different from the existing seat of the same name.\n\nHe was re-elected, in Selly Oak, at the May 2010 general election. \n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, he served as a Shadow Minister for Education as part of Ed Miliband's front bench team.\n\nHe supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.\n\nMcCabe called in 2013 for a referendum on remaining in the EU to be held \"as soon as possible\", admitting he found himself \"at odds with his party\" on the issue. McCabe joined 18 other Labour MPs in backing a referendum on Europe in a House of Commons vote called by rebel Conservative MPs.\n\nIn the 2009 expenses scandal it was revealed that McCabe had over-claimed on his mortgage by £4,059. A three-month investigation by the parliamentary fees office resulted in McCabe calling for Commons officials to be sacked. He later admitted: \"I did make an error in my claim and, as the letter from the fees office shows, this money was repaid in a deduction from my next claim\". Between 2004 and 2008, McCabe claimed £54,699 in expenses for his second home, on which he has a £60,000 mortgage. The claims included £5,500 for a new kitchen.\n\nMcCabe was appointed Parliamentary Chair of the Labour Friends of Israel in February 2020. He is a long-standing supporter and visited Israel as part of a delegation in 2019.\n\nIn 2012, McCabe underwent open heart surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham for a heart murmur.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, McCabe suffered minor facial injuries after a motorcyclist in Kings Heath, Birmingham threw a brick at him, which he reported to the police.\n\n"}

Developed by The Mills Corporation, the mall is located at the intersection of Maryland Route 100 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (Maryland Route 295) in northwestern Anne Arundel County (hence the name \"Arundel\" Mills).\n\nArundel Mills opened in November 2000 and, as of July 21, 2007, had over 225 stores. It is the first enclosed mall to feature a Medieval Times dinner theater. In addition to 17 large anchor stores, Arundel Mills features a Dave & Buster's, the Live! Casino & Hotel, and an Egyptian-themed 24-screen megaplex theater. The cinema was the only outlet of its Muvico Theaters chain in the state of Maryland before being sold to Cinemark in March 2009.\n\nThe mall's interior layout features a \"racetrack\" design and, more noticeably, the outline of a boat. Mall sponsors are Coca-Cola, Comcast, and Discover Card. It was formerly sponsored by \"The Baltimore Sun\" and Toyota.\n\nAs of February 2020, the mall's anchor and department stores include Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Books-A-Million, Burlington Coat Factory, The Children's Place, Cinemark Egyptian 24 Theatres, Dave & Buster's, Forever 21, H&M, Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament, Modell's Sporting Goods, OFF 5th Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet, T.J.

The proposal for slots at Arundel Mills was on the ballot as a referendum in the November 2010 elections; the referendum passed, and construction began on the casino shortly afterward, with the grand opening of its first phase held on June 6, 2012. Since full completion in September 2012, Live! Casino & Hotel has about 380,000 sq. ft. of floor space and 4,750 gaming slots. Live! Casino & Hotel is a free-standing facility, separated from Arundel Mills by the inner mall ring road. Although not directly connected to the mall, the casino is within walking distance of the food court entrance. Live! Casino & Hotel includes a 5,000-space parking structure at Arundel Mills with a \"smart park\" green-and-red-light space availability feature, such as the system used at nearby BWI Airport. Parking is available free of charge during all mall hours for Arundel Mills shoppers.\n\nLive! Casino & Hotel includes several dining options, including Bobby's Burger Palace; The Cheesecake Factory; and a Prime Rib steakhouse. The project was to feature an Obrycki's Crab House and Seafood Restaurant, though the restaurant announced in November 2011 that it would not be opening a location there.

It runs some of Britain's largest Live Roleplay events, attracting around 1,200 to 1,500 to its first three events each year and around 2,500 to 3,000 people to The Gathering. It was formed in 1992, originally as a charitable organisation (hence \"Trust\" in the name). In 1995 it became Merlinroute ltd trading as Lorien Trust. The Lorien Trust has a well established game world, and uses its own set of LARP rules, known simply as the \"Lorien Trust rules system\". In addition to the four events held per year, the Lorien Trust also sanctions many smaller events to use the same system and game world.\n\nThe Lorien Trust's flagship event is The Gathering. It is held over the August bank holiday weekend. The final battle of The Gathering normally draws around 1200 players on each side. These are some of the largest Live Action battles in Europe.\n\nThe setting for these events is the fictional world of Erdreja which is described as \"high fantasy/medieval\".\n\n\nErdreja is a relatively free-form fantasy world which imports its concepts from numerous sources including \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and fantasy novels. The LT's campaign focuses around a continental region of Erdreja, known as the Heartlands. This region is divided into ten separate kingdoms, each governed by one of the Factions of Erdreja. Each Faction takes its name from an animal associated with that kingdom. Every player character belongs to one of the ten Factions. Characters may also be members of none/any/all of the ten Guilds.\n\nThe ten factions and their main inspirations are:\n\nThe fifteen guilds are:\n\nWithin the Factions, players organise themselves into semi-independent groups (e.g. The Chaos Guild). Each group usually has some kind of common purpose (a military unit, for example, or a trading company), and many players will put great effort into giving their group a strong identity.\n\nIn addition to the Factions, there are also a number of international Guilds, whose In Character role is to provide training and support for members of different professions. Out of Character, the Guilds also help to administer the LT system - the Mages' Guild, for example, handles the distribution of spell-cards (OOC items needed by players of magic-using characters).\n\nIn the early years of the LT, Erdreja was conceived as an open gameworld: players were allowed to play any kind of character they wished. Over time, the problems of maintaining continuity in such a free-flowing system, coupled with the growing prevalence of LARPs with closed gameworlds, led the LT to exert some control over the types of character permitted in the system. That said, there is still a wide variety of races and character roles available to players. The races, like much of the rest of the gameworld, are drawn from fantasy literature:\n\nErdreja is saturated with magic of various kinds, and spell-casting characters are common. In-character rituals are often carried out by players to create magical items or to further an ongoing plot. In character faith is universally based around ancestor worship.\n\nIn June 2011 the Lorien Trust gameworld (more specifically the bears faction forums) was found to be the 385th most visited website by the UK's Department of Transport. This was picked up by various newspapers and the BBC. In October 2012 the \"Huffington Post\" posted an in depth article exploring a first-time roleplayer's view of the Live Roleplay scene from the point of view of someone attending the Gathering for the first time and interviewing a number of attendees, charting The Lorien Trust and other systems in the UK.\n\n"}

His father, also named James Christie, was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate in the 1914 provincial election. His mother was Annie Ferguson.\n\nThe younger James Christie served as the provincial director of Manitoba Livestock Producers Ltd. and was an official or member in several local farm associations as well as being an active freemason. He served as a soldier in France with the Motor Machine Gun Corps from 1916 to 1918 during World War I, and was wounded during the Arras-Cambrai drive.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1932 provincial election, defeating incumbent Conservative William H. Spinks by 256 votes in the Cypress constituency. In the 1936 election, he was re-elected over Conservative candidate R.G. Hurton by 129 votes. Christie again defeated Hurton, who was by this time an independent candidate, in the 1941 provincial election.\n\nChristie's re-election in the 1945 provincial election occurred under unusual circumstances. During this period, the Liberal-Progressive Party was the dominant power in a coalition government which also included the Progressive Conservative Party, Social Credit and some independents. At a nomination meeting to determine the governing coalition's candidate, Christie unexpectedly lost to independent Robin Parsons by one vote. He challenged the validity of the result, however, and entered the general election as a candidate against Parsons. There were no further candidates, and Christie was easily elected over Parsons.

{"id": "1980155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980155", "title": "L'heure espagnole", "text": "L'heure espagnole\n\nL'heure espagnole is a French one-act opera from 1911, described as a \"comédie musicale\", with music by Maurice Ravel to a French libretto by Franc-Nohain, based on Franc-Nohain's 1904 play ('comédie-bouffe') of the same name The opera, set in Spain in the 18th century, is about a clockmaker whose unfaithful wife attempts to make love to several different men while he is away, leading to them hiding in, and eventually getting stuck in, her husband's clocks. The title can be translated literally as \"The Spanish Hour\", but the word \"heure\" more importantly means \"time\" – \"Spanish Time\", with the connotation \"How They Keep Time in Spain\".\n\nThe original play had first been performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon on 28 October 1904. Ravel began working on the music as early as 1907, and the opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique on 19 May 1911.\n\nRavel dedicated \"L'heure espagnole\" to Madame Jean Cruppi, whose son he would later commemorate with one of the movements of \"Le Tombeau de Couperin \". \n\nRavel was closely involved in every aspect of the production as it was prepared for its premiere by the Opéra-Comique at the Salle Favart in Paris.\nThe opera was first performed by the Opéra-Comique on 19 May 1911, in a double-bill with \"Thérèse\" by Jules Massenet; after the initial nine performances it was not revived. The Paris Opéra presented it on 5 December 1921 with Fanny Heldy as Concepción, and it enjoyed more success. The opera returned to the Opéra-Comique in 1945 where it continued in the repertoire. Outside France, \"L’heure espagnole\" was first seen at Covent Garden in 1919, Chicago and New York in 1920, Brussels in 1921, followed by Basel and Rotterdam (1923), Prague (1924), Hamburg, Stockholm (1925), reaching Buenos Aires in 1932 and Cairo in 1934. The opera was performed for the first time in Canada at the 1961 Montreal Festivals.\n\nIn relation to Ravel's vocal writing in the opera, Roland-Manuel wrote \"The language of the music is linked up as naturally as possible with the music of the language\".\nIn an interview published two days before the premiere, Ravel explained his approach to his new opera. \"I have written an opéra-bouffe. Apart from [Gonzalve] who sings sérénades and cavatines with deliberately exaggerated melodies, the other rôles will give, I think, the impression of being spoken.\" Ravel also cited Mussorgsky's \"The Marriage\" for the effect he was aiming to achieve in the word setting, and underlined the Spanish elements of the score in his use of jotas, habaneras and malagueñas.\nKobbé commented that from \"the delightful clock noises of the opening to the Habanera quintet of the end, \"L'Heure Espagnole\" is full of charming music\", while Grove notes that the opera is one of a group of Spanish influenced works that span Ravel’s career and that in it he employed \"a virtuouso use of the modern orchestra\".\n\nThe opera takes place in 21 scenes, with an introduction.\n\nTorquemada is at work in his shop when the muleteer Ramiro stops by to have his watch fixed, so that he can fulfill his duties at collecting the town's post. It is Thursday, the day that Torquemada goes out to tend the municipal clocks, so Ramiro must wait. Torquemada's wife, Concepción, enters to complain that her husband hasn't yet moved a clock into her bedroom. After Torquemada has left, she takes advantage of his absence to plan assignations with gentleman friends. However, the presence of Ramiro is initially a hindrance. So she asks him to move a grandfather clock to her bedroom, which he agrees to do.\n\nMeanwhile, she waits for Gonzalve, a poet. He arrives, and is inspired to poetry, but not to lovemaking, where Concepción would prefer the latter. When Ramiro is about to return, she sends him back saying that she chose the wrong clock. She then has the idea of having Gonzalve hide in one clock so that Ramiro can carry him upstairs. After Gonzalve is concealed, Don Iñigo, a banker and another of Concepción's gentleman friends, arrives. When Ramiro returns, she persuades him to carry up the clock with Gonzalve concealed in it, and she accompanies him.\n\nOn his own, Don Iñigo conceals himself in another clock. Ramiro enters, asked to watch the shop, and musing on how little he understands of women. Concepción then summons him back upstairs, saying that the clock's hands are running backwards. She and Don Iñigo try to communicate, but Ramiro arrives back with the other clock. Don Iñigo has hidden himself again, and Ramiro now carries up the clock with Don Iñigo upstairs.\n\nWith Gonzalve now downstairs, Concepción tries to turn him away from poetry towards her, but Gonzalve is too absorbed to follow her lead. Ramiro returns, and Gonzalve must conceal himself again. He offers to take the second clock up again. Impressed by how easily Ramiro carries the clocks (and their load) upstairs, Concepción begins to be physically attracted to him.\n\nWith Gonzalve and Don Iñigo now each stuck in clocks, Torquemada returns from his municipal duties. Both Gonzalve and Don Inigo eventually escape their respective clock enclosures, the latter with more difficulty. To save face, they each have to purchase a clock. Concepción is now left without a clock, but she muses that she can wait for the muleteer to appear regularly with his watch repaired. The opera ends with a quintet finale, as the singers step out of character to intone the moral of the tale, paraphrasing Boccaccio:\n\n\"Among all lovers, only the efficient succeed,<br>\nThe moment arrives, in the pursuit of love,<br>\nWhen the muleteer has his turn!\"\nWoodwinds\n\nBrass\n\nPercussion\n\nKeyboard\n\nStrings\n\n\n"}

She opened a restaurant across from the Mendocino County Courthouse, where lawyers encouraged her to study law.\n\nWhile there she became the first female attorney in Ukiah, California (but she never practiced law) before moving south in 1920, to Monterey Park, California, where Charles ran a gas station (a garage and attached brick building at the northeast corner of Atlantic and Garvey) until he was disabled repairing a car. Laura took over the gas station, and branched out into the potato chips in 1926 and later, peanut butter in 1931. The Scudders lived in La Habra Heights Laura Scudder tended a victory garden and wrote a newspaper column.\n\nIn the early days, potato chips were distributed in bulk from barrels or glass display cases, or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled. Laura Scudder started paying her workers to take home sheets of wax paper and iron them into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day. This innovation kept the chips fresh and crisp longer and, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed potato chips to become a mass market product. Other potato chip makers soon began to package their chips in bags.\n\nScudder also began putting dates on the bags, becoming the first company to freshness date its food products and sold in twin packs to further reduce staleness and crumbling. This new standard of freshness was reflected in the marketing slogan: \"Laura Scudder's Potato Chips, the Noisiest Chips in the World.\" The Laura Scudder Potato Chip Factory was at Garvey Avenue east of Atlantic Boulevard, Monterey Park in the 1920s.\n\nLaura Scudder faced many obstacles running her own company during the Great Depression. For instance, when she tried to get insurance for the company's delivery truck, she was denied by all the local male insurance agents, who claimed that a woman would be unreliable at paying the premiums. The female insurance agent who eventually insured the truck went on to insure the entire company fleet.\n\nShe expanded into peanut butter and mayonnaise in order to keep her workforce employed year round since potato chips tended to sell best during summertime. She published recipes to raise interest in her products and was noted for a chocolate cake recipe that used mayonnaise instead of eggs and butter. Ingredients like butter and fresh eggs were scarce during World War II due to rationing for civilians because of the effort to supply the needs of military personnel.\nLaura Scudder's Mayflower Potato Chips Billboard (1931 - Fairfax Ave. looking south from Drexel Ave.).\n\nAt one point, Laura Scudder turned down a $9 million offer for the company because the buyer wouldn't guarantee her employees' jobs. In 1957, she sold her firm to Signal Oil & Gas of Signal Hill, with a $6 million offer from a buyer who guaranteed job security for her workforce. The new company was called Laura Scudder Inc. At the time of the sale, the company had expanded into mayonnaise, and Laura Scudder brand potato chips held a greater than 50% share of the Californian market. She continued to run the company until her death in 1959. Laura Scudder's Papers and the Women’s Studies Scholarship is at Chapman University. Laura Scudder Program Series is at the Bruggemeyer Library, in Monterey Park. with donations from the Laura Scudder Foundation\nIn 1987, Laura Scudder Inc. was sold to Borden, Inc. for $100 million. Annual sales for the chipmaker were $126 million in 1986. Union difficulties motivated Borden to close all California plants of Laura Scudder only a year later. Borden's overall culture of mismanagement, incurrence of excessive debt to finance numerous acquisitions, and several restructurings in 1993, led Borden to sell what remained of Laura Scudder for less than $16.7 million. The buyer, G.F. Industries, Inc.'s Granny Goose subsidiary was already in trouble, and was put up for sale in January 1995. In 2009, Snack Alliance, Inc. licensed from The Laura Scudder's Company, LLC the rights to produce and market potato chips under the Laura Scudder's brand. According to the J.M. Smucker Company website, the Laura Scudder's Natural Peanut Butter business was acquired by Smucker's from BAMA Foods Inc. in December 1994. As of 2009, Smucker's marketed the Laura Scudder's brand of natural peanut butter on the west coast. According to a March 31, 2010 announcement, Snack Alliance, Inc. was acquired by Shearers Foods Inc., a manufacturer of competing salty snacks in different regions of North America. At the same time (2010) it appears the original Laura Scudder's brand is being actively marketed by a Californian company. These two companies have different packaging for their different Laura Scudder's products, and the Californian company appears to be marketing its products nationwide.\n\n"}

This subgenre started in the Victorian and Edwardian eras and had its apex of popularity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other related terms for fiction of this type include scientific romances.

Once cool, the pastry is then filled with a vanilla-, coffee- or chocolate-flavoured custard (\"crème pâtissière\"), or with whipped cream, or chiboust cream; and then iced with fondant icing. Other fillings include pistachio- and rum-flavoured custard, fruit-flavoured fillings, or chestnut purée. The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob.\n\nThe word comes from the French \"éclair\", meaning \"flash of lightning\", so named because it is eaten quickly (in a flash).\n\nThe éclair originated during the nineteenth century in France where it was called \"pain à la Duchesse\" or \"petite duchesse\" until 1850. The word is first attested both in English and in French in the 1860s. Some food historians speculate that éclairs were first made by Antonin Carême (1784–1833), the famous French chef.

With Dolores del Río and María Félix, he was one of the best-known Latin American movie stars of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nArmendáriz was born in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico to Pedro Armendáriz García Conde (Mexican) and Adela Hastings (American). He was also the cousin of actress Gloria Marín. Armendáriz and his younger brother Francisco lived with their uncle Henry Hastings, Sr. in Laredo, Texas after their mother died. He later studied in California. He started in the world of acting by participating in the stage plays performed by the theater group at the University of California, where he continued a career in law. He graduated with an engineering degree from the California Polytechnic State University.\n\nWhen Armendáriz finished his studies, he moved to Mexico where he worked for the railroad, as a tour guide and as a journalist for the bilingual magazine \"México Real\". He was discovered by film director Miguel Zacarías when Armendáriz recited a soliloquy from \"Hamlet\" to an American tourist. His meeting with the director Emilio Fernández was providential, whereupon the actor and director began working in numerous films: \"Soy puro mexicano\" (1942), \"Flor silvestre\" (1942) and specially \"María Candelaria\" (1943) were the first films of intense common path. Under the guidance of Emilio Fernández, Pedro Armendáriz developed the film personality traits of strong nationalist; often, he played tough and manly men, indigenous, peasants and revolutionaries. Amendáriz repeatedly portrayed Pancho Villa and played opposite actresses such as Dolores del Río and María Félix.\n\nWith Dolores del Río, Amendáriz formed one of the most legendary couples of the Mexican cinema. \"María Candelaria\" provided Armendáriz with international visibility. The film was awarded the Palm d'Or at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. Other prominent titles where Armendáriz appeared with Dolores del Río were \"Las Abandonadas\" (1944), \"Bugambilia\" (1944) and \"La Malquerida\" (1949). Maria Felix was his other partner in such films as \"Enamorada\" (1946) or \"Maclovia\" (1948).\n\nIn the late 40s, he made the jump to Hollywood by the hand of John Ford. Armendáriz was a favorite of Ford, appearing in three of his films: \"The Fugitive\" (1947), \"Fort Apache\" and \"3 Godfathers\" (both 1948).\nBesides his career in the Mexican cinema, Armendáriz made a remarkable career in Hollywood and Europe. His other prominent films in Hollywood were: \"We Were Strangers\" (1949, directed by John Huston), \"The Torch\" (1950), \"Border River\" (1954), \"The Conqueror\" (1956) and \"Diane\" (1956), among others. In Europe, highlighted his participation in the film \"Lucrèce Borgia\" (1953), filmed in France. In Mexico, his participation highlighted such notable films such as \"El Bruto\" (1953, directed by Luis Buñuel), \"La Cucaracha\" (1959) and \"La Bandida\" (1962).\n\nArmendáriz's last appearance was in the second James Bond film, \"From Russia with Love\" (1963), as Bond's ally, Kerim Bey. Armendáriz was terminally ill with cancer during the filming of \"From Russia with Love\", and towards the end of shooting he was too ill to perform his part; his final scenes were performed by his double, director Terence Young. Armendáriz died four months before the release of the film.\n\nArmendáriz was married to actress Carmelita Bohr (née Pardo) by whom he had one son and daughter. Pedro Armendáriz, Jr. also became an actor and appeared in the James Bond film \"Licence to Kill\" (1989); his daughter Carmen Armendáriz became a TV producer.\n\nIn 1956, Armendáriz had a role in the film \"The Conqueror\" produced by Howard Hughes. The movie was filmed in the state of Utah at the time when the US government was doing above-ground nuclear testing in neighboring Nevada. Within 25 years, 91 of the 220 people involved in the production (46%) developed cancer, 46 of whom died.\n\nArmendáriz began to suffer pain in his hips; years later it was discovered that he had neck cancer. He learned his condition was terminal while at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California and, reportedly, endured great pain to film \"From Russia with Love\" (he visibly limps in most scenes) in order to assure his family financial resources.\n\nOn June 18, 1963, Armendáriz committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a gun he had smuggled into the hospital.

Economics drove the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to replace oil with coal gas lighting in 1870, but a gas cylinder explosion on the train led them to abandon the experiment. Oil-gas lighting was introduced in late 1870. Electrical lighting was introduced in October 1881 by using twelve Swan carbon filament incandescent lamps connected to an underslung battery of 32 Faure lead-acid rechargeable cells, suitable for about 6 hours lighting before being removed for recharging.\n\nThe North British Railway in 1881 successfully generated electricity using a dynamo on the \"Brotherhood\" steam locomotive to provide electrical lighting in a train, a concept that was later called \"head-end power\". High steam consumption led to abandonment of the system. Three trains were started in 1883 by London, Brighton and South Coast Railway with electricity generated on board using a dynamo driven from one of the axles. This charged a lead-acid battery in the guard's van, and the guard operated and maintained the equipment. The system successfully provided electric lighting in the train.\n\nIn 1887, steam-driven generators in the baggage cars of the \"Florida Special\" and the \"Chicago Limited\" trains in the US supplied electric lighting to all the cars of the train by wiring them, to introduce the other form of head-end power.\n\nThe oil-gas lighting provided a higher intensity of light compared to electric lighting and was more popularly used until September 1913, when an accident on the Midland Railway at Aisgill caused a large number of passenger deaths. This accident prompted railways to adopt electricity for lighting the trains.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the age of steam and into the early diesel era, passenger cars were heated by low pressure saturated steam supplied by the locomotive, with the electricity for car lighting and ventilation being derived from batteries charged by axle-driven generators on each car, or from engine-generator sets mounted under the carbody. Starting in the 1930s, air conditioning became available on railcars, with the energy to run them being provided by mechanical power take offs from the axle, small dedicated engines or propane.\n\nThe resulting separate systems of lighting power, steam heat, and engine-driven air conditioning, increased the maintenance workload as well as parts proliferation. Head-end power would allow for a single power source to handle all those functions, and more, for an entire train.\n\nIn the steam era, all cars in Finland and Russia had a wood or coal fired fireplace. Such a solution was considered a fire danger in most countries in Europe, but not in Russia.\n\nOriginally, trains hauled by a steam locomotive would be provided with a supply of steam from the locomotive for heating the carriages. When diesel locomotives and electric locomotives replaced steam, the steam heating was then supplied by a steam-heat boiler. This was oil-fired (in diesel locomotives) or heated by an electric element (in electric locomotives). Oil-fired steam-heat boilers were unreliable. They caused more locomotive failures on any class to which they were fitted than any other system or component of the locomotive, and this was a major incentive to adopt a more reliable method of carriage heating.\n\nAt this time, lighting was powered by batteries which were charged by a dynamo underneath each carriage when the train was in motion, and buffet cars would use bottled gas for cooking and water heating.\n\nLater diesels and electric locomotives were equipped with Electric Train Heating (ETH) apparatus, which supplied electrical power to the carriages to run electric heating elements installed alongside the steam-heat apparatus, which was retained for use with older locomotives. Later carriage designs abolished the steam-heat apparatus, and made use of the ETH supply for heating, lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, fans, sockets and kitchen equipment in the train. In recognition of this ETH was eventually renamed Electric Train Supply (ETS).\n\nEach coach has an index relating to the maximum consumption of electricity that it could use. The sum of all the indices must not exceed the index of the locomotive. One \"ETH index unit\" equals 5 kW; a locomotive with an ETH index of 95 can supply 475 kW of electrical power to the train.\n\nThe first advance over the old axle generator system was developed on the Boston and Maine Railroad, which had placed a number of steam locomotives and passenger cars into dedicated commuter service in Boston. Due to the low average speeds and frequent stops characteristic of a commuter operation, the axle generators' output was insufficient to keep the batteries charged, resulting in passenger complaints about lighting and ventilation failures. In response, the railroad installed higher capacity generators on the locomotives assigned to these trains, and provided electrical connections to the cars. The cars used steam from the locomotive for heating.\n\nSome early diesel streamliners took advantage of their fixed-consist construction to employ electrically-powered lighting, air conditioning, and heating. As the cars were not meant to mix with existing passenger stock, compatibility of these systems was not a concern. For example, the Nebraska Zephyr trainset has three diesel generator sets in the first car to power onboard equipment.\n\nWhen diesel locomotives were introduced to passenger service, they were equipped with steam generators to provide steam for car heating. However, the use of axle generators and batteries persisted for many years. This started to change in the late 1950s, when the Chicago and North Western Railway removed the steam generators from their EMD F7 and E8 locomotives in commuter service and installed diesel generator sets (see \"Peninsula 400\"). This was a natural evolution, as their commuter trains were already receiving low-voltage, low-current power from the locomotives to assist axle generators in maintaining battery charge.\n\nWhile many commuter fleets were quickly converted to HEP, long-distance trains continued to operate with steam heat and battery-powered electrical systems. This gradually changed following the transfer of intercity passenger rail service to Amtrak and Via Rail, ultimately resulting in full adoption of HEP in the US and Canada and the discontinuation of the old systems.\n\nFollowing its formation in 1971, Amtrak's initial locomotive purchase was the Electro-Motive (EMD) SDP40F, an adaptation of the widely used SD40-2 3000 horsepower freight locomotive, fitted with a passenger style carbody and steam generating capability. The SDP40F permitted the use of modern motive power in conjunction with the old steam-heated passenger cars acquired from predecessor railroads, allowing Amtrak time to procure purpose-built cars and locomotives.\n\nIn 1975, Amtrak started to take delivery of the all-electric Amfleet car, hauled by General Electric (GE) P30CH and E60CH locomotives, later augmented by EMD F40PH and AEM-7 locomotives, all of which were equipped to furnish HEP. Five Amtrak E8s were rebuilt with HEP generators for this purpose. In addition, 15 baggage cars were converted to HEP generator cars to allow the hauling of Amfleet by non-HEP motive power (such as GG1s substituting for unreliable Metroliner EMUs). Following the introduction of the Amfleet, the (all-electric) Superliner railcar was placed into operation on long-distance western routes. Amtrak subsequently converted a portion of the steam-heated fleet to all-electric operation using HEP, and retired the remaining unconverted cars by the mid-1980s.\n\nThe HEP generator can be driven by either a separate engine mounted in the locomotive or generator car, or by the locomotive's prime mover.\n\nGenset-supplied HEP is usually through an auxiliary diesel unit that is independent from the main propulsion (prime mover) engine. Such engine/generator sets are generally installed in a compartment in the rear of the locomotive. Both the prime mover and the HEP genset share fuel supplies.\n\nSmaller under-car engine/generator sets for providing electricity on short trains are also manufactured.\n\nIn many applications, the locomotive's prime mover provides both propulsion and head-end power. If the HEP generator is driven by the engine then it must run at a constant speed (RPM) to maintain the required 50 Hz or 60 Hz AC line frequency. An engineer will not have to keep the throttle in a higher run position, as the onboard electronics control the speed of the engine to maintain the set frequency.\n\nMore recently, locomotives have adopted the use of a static inverter, powered from the traction generator, which allows the prime mover to have a larger RPM range.\n\nWhen derived from the prime mover, HEP is generated at the expense of traction power. For example, the General Electric P32 and P40 locomotives are derated to , respectively, when supplying HEP. The Fairbanks-Morse P-12-42 was one of the first HEP equipped locomotives to have its prime mover configured to run at a constant speed, with traction generator output regulated solely by varying excitation voltage.\n\nOne of the first tests of HEP powered by an EMD locomotive's prime mover was in 1969, on Milwaukee Road EMD E9 #33C, which was converted to have a constant speed rear engine.\n\nHEP power supplies the lighting, HVAC, dining car kitchen and battery charging loads. Individual car electrical loading ranges from 20 kW for a typical car to more than 150 kW for a Dome car with kitchen and dining area, such as Princess Tours Ultra Dome cars operating in Alaska.\nBecause of train lengths and the high power requirements in North America, HEP is supplied as three-phase AC at 480 V (standard in the US), 575 V, or 600 V. Transformers are fitted in each car for reduction to lower voltages.\n\nIn the UK, ETS is supplied at 800 V to 1000 V AC/DC two pole (400 or 600 A), 1500 V AC two pole (800 A) or at 415 V 3 phase on the HST. On the former Southern Region, Mk I carriages were wired for a 750 V DC supply. This corresponds to line voltage on the Third Rail network. Class 73 Locomotives simply supply this line voltage direct to the ETS jumpers, whilst Class 33 Diesel Electric Locomotives have a separate engine driven Train Heating Generator which supplies 750 V DC to the train heating connections.\n\nIn Ireland, HEP is provided at European/IEC standard 230/400 V 50 Hz (originally 220/380 V 50 Hz.) This is to the same specification as the power systems used in Irish and EU domestic and commercial buildings and industry.\n\nOn the Cork-Dublin CAF MK4 sets, this is provided by two generators, located in the driving trailer van and on the push-pull Enterprise sets, this is provided by generators in a dedicated tailing van. Irish DMU trains, which make up the majority of the fleet, use small generators located under each coach.\n\nHistorically, HEP and, in older vehicles, steam heating was provided by trailing generator vans containing generators and steam boilers. These were normally located on the rear of train sets. The Enterprise Dublin-Belfast train sets initially used HEP from GM 201 diesel-electric locomotives, but due reliability issues and excessive wear on the locomotives systems, generator vans (sourced from retired Irish Rail MK3 sets and adapted for push-pull use) were added.\n\nRussian cars use electric heating with either 3 kV DC voltage on DC lines or 3 kV AC voltage on AC lines provided by locomotive's main transformer. Newer cars are mostly made by Western European manufacturers and are equipped similarly to RIC cars.\n\nRIC cars must be able to be supplied at all the following four voltages: 1,000 V AC  Hz, 1,500 V AC 50 Hz, 1,500 V DC and 3,000 V DC. The first one is used in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, where the catenary system is used. The second one (1.5 kV AC) is used in countries which use catenary system (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Serbia and UK, and some lines in France, Italy and Russia). In both cases, the proper voltage is provided by the locomotive's main transformer or an AC alternator in diesel locomotives. In countries using DC power (either 1.5 kV or 3 kV DC), the voltage collected by the pantograph is supplied directly to the cars. (Belgium, Poland and Spain, and some lines in Russia and Italy use 3 kV, and the Netherlands, and some lines in France use 1.5 kV; see more detailed information in the \"List of railway electrification systems\" article.)\n\nModern cars often support 1,000 V AC 50 Hz as well, this variety is sometimes found in depots and parking spots.\n\nOlder European cars used high voltage (or steam – supplied by steam locomotive (some diesels and electrics also had steam boilers fitted), there were also steam generator cars in use and some cars were fitted with coal- or oil-fired boiler) only for heating, while light, fans and other low-current supply (e.g. shaver sockets in bathrooms) power was provided by axle-driven generator. Today, with the developments in solid state electronics (thyristors and IGBTs), most cars have switching power supplies which take any RIC voltage (1.0 – 3.0 kV DC or /50 Hz) and can supply all the needed lower voltages. Low voltages differ depending on manufacturers, but typical values are:\n\nElectric heating was typically supplied from high-voltage HEP line, but the unusual voltages are not common on the market and the equipment is expensive.\n\nA standard RIC-compliant HV heater has six resistors which are being switched accordingly to voltage: 6 in series (3 kV DC), 2 × 3 in series (1.5 kV AC or DC) or 3 × 2 in series (1 kV AC). The selection and switching of a proper configuration is automatic for the sake of safety. Passengers can only operate thermostat.\n\nIn China, HEP is supplied in two forms.\n\nOn all 25A/G cars built before 2005, rebuilt and air-conditioned 22/25B cars, most 25K cars, and most BSP-built 25T cars, HEP is supplied at three-phase 380 V AC by generator cars (originally classified as TZ cars, later reclassified to KD), a small number of DF11G diesel locomotives, and very limited number of retrofitted SS9 electrics. Cars with diesel generator sets (factory-built RZ/RW/CA22/23/25B cars, some rebuilt YZ/YW22/23/25B cars, most German-built 24 cars, and very limited number of 25G/K/T cars for special use) also supply their own power in this form. It's possible to route AC electricity from a car with diesel generator set to a neighboring normal HEP car, although both cars can't run their air conditioning or heat on full load in this situation. Those diesel-powered cars can also run on HEP from elsewhere, without using their own diesel. Although considered inefficient and obsolete, mainly because the generator car 'wastes' traction power, staff, and fuel (if running on electrified lines), new cars using AC HEP are still in production, along with new generator cars/sets, mostly for use in areas without electrification, considering that the vast majority of China Railways' engines that are capable of supplying HEP are electric locomotives.\n\nOn most newer 25G cars and 25/19T cars, power is supplied at 600 V DC by electric locos such as SS7C, SS7D, SS7E, SS8, SS9, HXD1D, HXD3C, HXD3D, and some DF11G diesels (No.0041, 0042, 0047, 0048, 0053-0056, 0101-0218). Small number of special generator cars (QZ-KD25T) designated for use on the high-altitude Qinghai–Tibet Railway also supply power at 600 V DC. With new DC-equipped engines and cars entering service rapidly, as well as ageing and retirement of older equipments using AC, DC HEP has become the more prominent form of power supply of China Railways.\n\nVery limited number of cars, mostly 25Ts, can run on both forms of HEP.\n\nAlthough most locomotive-hauled trains take power directly from the locomotive, there have been examples (mainly in continental Europe) where restaurant cars could take power directly from the overhead wires while the train is standing and not connected to head-end power. For example, the German restaurant cars WRmz 135 (1969), WRbumz 139 (1975) and ARmz 211 (1971) were all equipped with pantographs.\n\nSome Finnish dining/catering cars have a built-in diesel-generator set that is used even when a locomotive-supplied power is available.\n\nWhen the State of Connecticut began the Shore Line East service, they were using, in many cases, new passenger cars with old freight diesels which were not able to supply HEP, so some of the coaches were delivered with an HEP generator installed. With the acquisition of locomotives with HEP these have since been removed.\n\nWhere a passenger train must be hauled by a locomotive with no HEP supply (or an incompatible HEP supply) a separate generator van may be used such as on the Amtrak Cascades train or Iarnród Éireann's CAF Mark 4 Driving Van Trailer (with twin MAN 2846 LE 202 (320 kW) / Letag (330 kVA) engine / generator sets, assembled by GESAN). KiwiRail (New Zealand) use AG class luggage-generator vans for their Tranz Scenic passenger services; Tranz Metro on the Wairarapa line use SWG class passenger carriages with part of the interior adapted to house a generator. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus train used at least one custom-built power car that supplied HEP to its passenger coaches to avoid reliance upon host railway locomotives hauling the train.\n\nIn UK and Sweden the high-speed trains IC125 and X2000 have 50 Hz 3-phase power bus.\n\n"}

{"id": "1980293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980293", "title": "Garden city movement", "text": "Garden city movement\n\nThe garden city movement is a method of urban planning in which self-contained communities are surrounded by \"greenbelts\", containing proportionate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. The idea was initiated in 1898 by Ebenezer Howard in the United Kingdom and aims to capture the primary benefits of a countryside environment and a city environment while avoiding the disadvantages presented by both. Howard was knighted in 1927. During his lifetime Letchworth, Brentham Garden Suburb and Welwyn Garden City were built in or near London according to Howard’s concept and many other garden cities inspired by his model have since been built all over the world.\n\nInspired by the utopian novel \"Looking Backward\" and Henry George's work \"Progress and Poverty\", Howard published the book \": a Peaceful Path to Real Reform\" in 1898 (which was reissued in 1902 as \"Garden Cities of To-morrow\"). His idealised garden city would house 32,000 people on a site of 6,000 acres (2,400 ha), planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks and six radial boulevards, wide, extending from the centre. The garden city would be self-sufficient and when it reached full population, another garden city would be developed nearby. Howard envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 58,000 people, linked by road and rail.\n\nHoward's \": A Peaceful Path to Real Reform\" sold enough copies to result in a second edition, \"Garden Cities of \". This success provided him the support necessary to pursue the chance to bring his vision into reality. Howard believed that all people agreed the overcrowding and deterioration of cities was one of the troubling issues of their time. He quotes a number of respected thinkers and their disdain of cities. Howard's garden city concept combined the town and country in order to provide the working class an alternative to working on farms or in ‘crowded, unhealthy cities’.\n\nTo build a garden city, Howard needed money to buy land. He decided to get funding from \"gentlemen of responsible position and undoubted probity and honour\". He founded the Garden City Association (later known as the Town and Country Planning Association or TCPA), which created First Garden City, Ltd. in 1899 to create the garden city of Letchworth. However, these donors would collect interest on their investment if the garden city generated profits through rents or, as Fishman calls the process, ‘philanthropic land speculation’. Howard tried to include working class cooperative organisations, which included over two million members, but could not win their financial support. Because he had to rely only on the wealthy investors of First Garden City, Howard had to make concessions to his plan, such as eliminating the cooperative ownership scheme with no landlords, short-term rent increases, and hiring architects who did not agree with his rigid design plans.\n\nIn 1904, Raymond Unwin, a noted architect and town planner, and his partner Barry Parker, won the competition run by First Garden City Ltd. to plan Letchworth, an area 34 miles outside London. Unwin and Parker planned the town in the centre of the Letchworth estate with Howard's large agricultural greenbelt surrounding the town, and they shared Howard's notion that the working class deserved better and more affordable housing. However, the architects ignored Howard's symmetric design, instead replacing it with a more ‘organic’ design.\n\nLetchworth slowly attracted more residents because it brought in manufacturers through low taxes, low rents and more space. Despite Howard's best efforts, the home prices in this garden city could not remain affordable for blue-collar workers to live in. The populations comprised mostly skilled middle class workers. After a decade, the First Garden City became profitable and started paying dividends to its investors. Although many viewed Letchworth as a success, it did not immediately inspire government investment into the next line of garden cities.\n\nIn reference to the lack of government support for garden cities, Frederic James Osborn, a colleague of Howard and his eventual successor at the Garden City Association, recalled him saying, \"The only way to get anything done is to do it yourself.\" Likely in frustration, Howard bought land at Welwyn to house the second garden city in 1919. The purchase was at auction, with money Howard desperately and successfully borrowed from friends. The Welwyn Garden City Corporation was formed to oversee the construction. But Welwyn did not become self-sustaining because it was only 20 miles from London.\n\nEven until the end of the 1930s, Letchworth and Welwyn remained as the only existing garden cities in the United Kingdom. However, the movement did succeed in emphasizing the need for urban planning policies that eventually led to the New Town movement.\n\nHoward organised the Garden City Association in 1899. Two garden cities were built using Howard's ideas: Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City, both in the county of Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom. Howard's successor as chairman of the Garden City Association was Sir Frederic Osborn, who extended the movement to regional planning.\n\nThe concept was adopted again in the UK after World War II, when the New Towns Act spurred the development of many new communities based on Howard's egalitarian ideas.\nThe idea of the garden city was influential in other countries, including the United States. Examples include Residence Park in New Rochelle, New York; Woodbourne in Boston; Newport News, Virginia's Hilton Village; Pittsburgh's Chatham Village; Garden City, New York (parenthetically, the name \"Garden City,\" as it applied to the Stewart-designed city on Long Island, incorporated in 1869, pre-dates that of the garden city movement, which was established some years later near the end of the nineteenth century); Sunnyside, Queens; Jackson Heights, Queens; Forest Hills Gardens, also in the borough of Queens, New York; Radburn, New Jersey; Greenbelt, Maryland; Buckingham in Arlington County, Virginia; the Lake Vista neighborhood in New Orleans; Norris, Tennessee; Baldwin Hills Village in Los Angeles; and the Cleveland suburbs of Parma and Shaker Heights.\n\nGreendale, Wisconsin is one of three \"greenbelt\" towns planned beginning in 1935 under the direction of Rexford Guy Tugwell, head of the United States Resettlement Administration, under authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. The two other greenbelt towns are Greenbelt, Maryland (near Washington, D.C.) and Greenhills, Ohio (near Cincinnati). The greenbelt towns not only provided work and affordable housing, but also served as a laboratory for experiments in innovative urban planning. Greendale's plan was designed between 1936 and 1937 by a staff headed by Joseph Crane, Elbert Peets, Harry Bentley, and Walter C. Thomas for a site that had formerly consisted of of farmland.\n\nIn Canada, the Ontario towns of Don Mills (now incorporated into the City of Toronto) and Walkerville are, in part, garden cities, as well as the Montreal suburb of Mount Royal. The historic Townsite of Powell River, British Columbia and the Hydrostone district of Halifax, Nova Scotia are recognized as National Historic Sites of Canada built upon the Garden City Movement. In Montreal, la Cité-jardin du Tricentenaire is a classic form of Garden City located near the Olympic Stadium. All streets are cul-de-sacs and are linked via pedestrian paths to the community park.\nIn Peru, there is a long tradition in urban design that has been reintroduced in its architecture more recently. In 1966, the 'Residencial San Felipe' in Lima's district of Jesus Maria was built using the Garden City concept.\n\nIn São Paulo, Brazil, several neighbourhoods were planned as Garden Cities, such as Jardim América, Jardim Europa, Alto da Lapa, Alto de Pinheiros, Jardim da Saúde and Cidade Jardim (Garden City in Portuguese). Goiânia, capital of Goiás state, and Maringá are also examples of Garden Cities.\n\nIn Argentina, an example is \"Ciudad Jardín Lomas del Palomar\", declared by the influential Argentinian professor of engineering, Carlos María della Paolera, founder of \"Día Mundial del Urbanismo\" (World Urbanism Day), as the first Garden City in South America.\n\nIn Australia, the suburb of Colonel Light Gardens in Adelaide, South Australia, was designed according to Garden City principles. So too the town of Sunshine which is now a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria and the suburb of Lalor, also in Melbourne. The Peter Lalor Estate in Lalor takes its name from a leader of the Eureka Stockade and remains today in its original form. However it is under threat from developers and Whittlesea Council. Lalor:Peter Lalor Home Building Cooperative 1946-2012 Scollay, Moira. Pre-dating these was the garden suburb of Haberfield in 1901 by Richard Stanton, organised on a vertical integrated model from land subdivision, mortgage financing, house and interior designs and site landscaping.\n\nGarden city ideals were employed in the original town planning of Christchurch, New Zealand. Prior to the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, the city infrastructure and homes were well integrated into green spaces. The rebuild blueprint rethought the garden city concept and how it would best suit the city. Greenbelts and urban greenspaces have been redesigned to incorporate more living spaces.\n\nGarden City principles greatly influenced the design of colonial and post-colonial capitals during the early part of the 20th century. This is the case for New Delhi (designed as the new capital of British India after World War I), of Canberra (capital of Australia established in 1913) and of Quezon City (established in 1939, capital of the Philippines from 1948–76). The garden city model was also applied to many colonial hill stations, such as Da Lat in Vietnam (est. 1907) and Ifrane in Morocco (est. 1929).\n\nIn Bhutan's capital city Thimphu the new plan, following the Principles of Intelligent Urbanism, is an organic response to the fragile ecology. Using sustainable concepts, it is a contemporary response to the garden city concept.\n\nThe Garden City movement also influenced the Scottish urbanist Sir Patrick Geddes in the planning of Tel Aviv, Israel, in the 1920s, during the British Mandate for Palestine. Geddes started his Tel Aviv plan in 1925 and submitted the final version in 1927, so all growth of this garden city during the 1930s was merely \"based\" on the Geddes Plan. Changes were inevitable.\n\nThe Garden City movement was even able to take root in South Africa, with the development of the suburbs of Pinelands and Edgemead in Cape Town.\n\nIn Italy, the INA-Casa plan - a national public housing plan from the 1950s and '60s - designed several suburbs according to Garden City principles: examples are found in many cities and towns of the country, such as the Isolotto suburb in Florence, Falchera in Turin, Harar in Milan, Cesate Villaggio in Cesate (part of the Metropolitan City of Milan), etc.\n\nIn Belgium the Garden City movement took roots in the 1920s. After the First World War, there was a huge need for new housing. Social housing associations were created, often linked to political movements. In Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent new extensions of the city were build. These houses are still very popular among residents and classified as historical heritage. In the former Czechoslovakia, all industrial cities founded or reconstructed by the Bata Shoes company (Zlín, Svit, Partizánske) were at least influenced by the conception of the Garden City.\n\nThe Epcot Center in Bay Lake, Florida took some influence from Howard's Garden City concept while the park was still under construction.\n\nSingapore, a tropical city has over time incorporated various facets of the Garden City concept in its town plans to try and make the country a unique City in a Garden. In the 1970s, the country started including concepts in its town plans to ensure that building codes and land use plans made adequate provisions for greenery and nature to become part of community development, thereby providing a great living environment. In 1996, the National Parks Board was given the mandate to spearhead the development and maintenance of greenery and bring the island's green spaces and parks to the community.\n\nThe localities in following lists have been developed directly as Garden Cities or their development has been heavily influenced by the Garden City movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile garden cities were praised for being an alternative to overcrowded and industrial cities, along with greater sustainability, garden cities were often criticized for damaging the economy, being destructive of the beauty of nature, and being inconvenient. According to A. Trystan Edwards, garden cities lead to desecration of the country side by trying to recreate country side houses that could spread themselves; however, this was not a possible feat due to the limited space they had.\n\nMore recently the environmental movement's embrace of urban density has offered an \"implicit critique\" of the garden city movement. In this way the critique of the concept resembles critiques of other suburbanization models, though author Stephen Ward has argued that critics often do not adequately distinguish between true garden cities and more mundane dormitory city plans.\n\nIt is often referred to as an urban design experiment which is typified by failure due to the laneways used as common entries and exits to the houses helping ghettoise communities and encourage crime; it has ultimately lead to efforts to 'de-Radburn' or partially demolish American Radburn designed public housing areas.\n\nWhen interviewed in 1998, the architect responsible for introducing the design to public housing in New South Wales, Philip Cox, was reported to have admitted with regards to an American Radburn designed estate in the suburb of Villawood, \"everything that could go wrong in a society went wrong,\" and \"it became the centre of drugs, it became the centre of violence and, eventually, the police refused to go into it. It was hell.\"\n\nContemporary town-planning charters like \"New Urbanism\" and \"Principles of Intelligent Urbanism\" originated with this movement. Today there are many garden cities in the world, but most of them have devolved to dormitory suburbs, which completely differ from what Howard aimed to create.\n\nIn 2007, the Town and Country Planning Association marked its 108th anniversary by calling for Garden City and Garden Suburb principles to be applied to the present New Towns and Eco-towns in the United Kingdom. The campaign continued in 2013 with the publication in March of that year of \"Creating Garden Cities and Suburbs Today - a guide for councils\". Also in 2013, Lord Simon Wolfson announced that he would award the Wolfson Economics Prize for the best ideas on how to create a new garden city.\n\nIn 2014 The Letchworth Declaration was published which called for a body to accredit future garden cities in the UK. The declaration has a strong focus on the visible (architecture and layout) and the invisible (social, ownership and governance) architecture of a settlement. One result was the creation of the New Garden Cities Alliance as a community interest company. Its aim is to be complementary to groups like the Town and Country Planning Association and it has adopted TCPA garden city principles as well as those from other groups, including those from Cabannes and Ross's booklet \"21st Century Garden Cities of \".\n\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced plans for a new garden city to be built at Ebbsfleet Valley, Kent, in early 2014, with a second also planned as an expansion of Bicester, Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom government announced further plans for garden towns in 2015, supporting both the development of new communities in North Essex and support for sustainable and environmentally-friendly town development in Didcot, Oxfordshire. A \"Black Country Garden City\" was announced in 2016 with plans to build 45,000 new homes in the West Midlands on brownfield sites.\n\nOn 2 January 2017, plans for new garden villages, each with between 1,500 and 10,000 homes, and garden towns each with more than 10,000 houses were announced by the government. These smaller projects have been proposed due to opposition of \"urban sprawl\" in the garden city projects, as well as such quick expansion to small communities. The first wave of villages to be approved by ministers are to be located in:\n\n\nThe approved garden towns are to be located in:\n\n\nThe concept of garden cities is to produce relatively economically independent cities with short commute times and the preservation of the countryside. Garden suburbs arguably do the opposite. Garden suburbs are built on the outskirts of large cities with no sections of industry. They are therefore dependent on reliable transport allowing workers to commute into the city. Lewis Mumford, one of Howard’s disciples, explained the difference as \"The Garden City, as Howard defined it, is not a suburb but the antithesis of a suburb: not a rural retreat, but a more integrated foundation for an effective urban life.\"\n\nThe planned garden suburb emerged in the late 19th century as a by-product of new types of transportation were embraced by a newly prosperous merchant class. The first garden villages were built by English estate owners, who wanted to relocate or rebuild villages on their lands. It was in these cases that architects first began designing small houses. Early examples include Harewood and Milton Abbas. Major innovations that defined early garden suburbs and subsequent suburban town planning include linking villa-like homes with landscaped public spaces and roads.\n\nDespite the emergence of the garden suburb in England, the typology flowered in the second half of the 19th century in United States. There were generally two garden suburb typologies, the garden village and the garden enclave. The garden villages are spatially independent of the city but remain connected to the city by railroads, streetcars, and later automobiles. The villages often included shops and civic buildings. In contrast, garden enclaves are typically strictly residential and emphasize natural and private space, instead of public and community space. The urban form of the enclaves was often coordinated through the use of early land use controls typical of modern zoning, including controlled setbacks, landscaping, and materials.\n\nGarden suburbs were not part of Howard’s plan and were actually a hindrance to garden city planning—they were in fact almost the antithesis of Howard’s plan, what he tried to prevent. The suburbanisation of London was an increasing problem which Howard attempted to solve with his garden city model, which attempted to end urban sprawl by the sheer inhibition of land speculation due to the land being held in trust, and the inclusion of agricultural areas on the city outskirts.\n\nRaymond Unwin, one of Howard’s early collaborators on the Letchworth Garden City project in 1907, became very influential in formalizing the garden city principles in the design of suburbs through his work \"Town Planning in Practice: An Introduction to the Art of Designing Cities and Suburbs\" (1909). The book strongly influenced the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909, which provided municipalities the power to develop urban plans for new suburban communities.\n\nSmaller developments were also inspired by the garden city philosophy and were modified to allow for residential “garden suburbs” without the commercial and industrial components of the garden city. They were built on the outskirts of cities, in rural settings. Some notable examples being, in London, Hampstead Garden Suburb, the Sutton Garden Suburb in Benhilton, Sutton, Pinner's Pinnerwood conversation area and the 'Exhibition Estate' in Gidea Park and, in Liverpool, Wavertree Garden Suburb. The Gidea Park estate in particular was built during two main periods of activity, 1911 and 1934. Both resulted in some good examples of domestic architecture, by such architects as Wells Coates and Berthold Lubetkin. Thanks to such strongly conservative local residents’ associations as the Civic Society, both Hampstead and Gidea Park retain much of their original character.\n\nHowever it is important to note Bournville Village Trust in SW Birmingham UK. This important residential development was associated with the growth of ‘Cadbury’s Factory in a Garden’. Here garden city principles are a fundamental part of the Trust’s activity. There are very tight restrictions applying to the properties here, no stonewall cladding, uPVC windows, and so on.\n\nHoward's influence reached as far as Mexico City, where architect José Luis Cuevas was influenced by the garden city concept in the design of two of the most iconic inner-city subdivisions, Colonia Hipódromo de la Condesa (1926) and Lomas de Chapultepec (1928-9):\n\nThe subdivisions were based on the principles of the garden city as promoted by Ebenezer Howard, including ample parks and other open spaces, park islands in the middle of “grand avenues”, such as Avenida Amsterdam in colonia Hipódromo.\nOne unique example of a garden suburb is the Humberstone Garden Suburb in the United Kingdom by the Humberstone Anchor Tenants’ Association in Leicestershire, and it is the only garden suburb ever to be built by the members of a workers’ co-operative; it remains intact to the present. In 1887 the workers of the Anchor Shoe Company in Humberstone formed a workers' cooperative and built 97 houses.\n\nAmerican architects and partners, Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin were proponents of the movement and after their arrival in Australia to design the national capital Canberra, they produced a number of garden suburb estates, most notably at Eaglemont with the Glenard and Mount Eagle Estates and the Ranelagh and Milleara Estates in Victoria.\n\n\nRelated urban design concepts\n\n\n"}

During most of the 1980s, he studied and worked in several major hospitals abroad as a heart-lung transplant surgeon. From 1989–1994, he worked as a surgeon with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in various conflict zones: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Peru, Afghanistan, Somalia and Bosnia.\n\nStrada, along with his wife and a group of colleagues, founded EMERGENCY in 1994, basing its headquarters in Milan, Italy. Since then Emergency has treated more than 10 million patients. Gino's first project under the flag of EMERGENCY was based in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide in 1994, and he followed this up by launching projects in Iraq, Cambodia, Eritrea and Afghanistan.\n\nGino Strada's main focus throughout his career has been to help victims of war, including direct casualties of conflict and also those who, as a result of war, have no access to healthcare leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases.\n\nFor instance, Strada opened a new maternity centre in Afghanistan in 2003, which became a reference point in the Panjshir Valley and the surrounding provinces. The centre was recognised by the Afghan Ministry of Health as a centre of specialisation for gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics.\n\nIn 2007, Strada opened the Centre for Cardiac Surgery, the first hospital in the region to offer free, high-quality cardiac surgery to patients who would have otherwise been unable to access treatment. Strada worked in the centre until 2014, and today it has treated patients from 30 different countries, both within Africa and further afield.\n\nThe idea for the Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery came from Strada's belief that the basis for the freedom and quality of human beings with regard to dignity and rights, must also extend to the right to free treatment without discrimination: \"If you think of medicine as a human right, then you cannot have some hospitals that offer sophisticated, very effective, hi-tech medicine,\" he says, \"and then go to Africa and think, 'OK, here's a couple of vaccinations and a few shots'. Do we think that we human beings, we are all equal in rights and dignity, or not? We say, 'Yes, we are.'\" – interview in The Observer, 2013.\n\nThis belief also meant that in 2009, Strada contributed to the creation of the ANME (African Network of Medical Excellence), with the aim of promoting the construction of Medical Centres of Excellence across Africa, based on the model of the Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery. \nIn 2017, construction began on the second centre to form part of the network, the Centre of Excellence in Paediatric Surgery in Entebbe, Uganda.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, his wife Teresa Sarti died in Milan. She was co-founder with her husband of Emergency and president of the organization.\n\n\n\n"}

The rules were changed to entrust the Estonian public with the choice by means of televoting in 2004 (winner Neiokõsõ, second Kerli Kõiv) and 2005 (winner Suntribe), but due to the disappointing results in the ESC in those years there was a return to the former system in 2006.

{"id": "1980355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980355", "title": "MIM-72 Chaparral", "text": "MIM-72 Chaparral\n\nThe MIM-72A/M48 Chaparral is an American self-propelled surface-to-air missile system based on the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile system. The launcher is based on the M113 family of vehicles. It entered service with the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps in 1969 and was phased out between 1990 and 1998. It was intended to be used along with the M163 VADS, the Vulcan ADS covering short-range short-time engagements, and the Chaparral for longer range use.\n\nStarting in 1959 the U.S. Army MICOM (Missile Command) began development of an ambitious anti-aircraft missile system under their \"Forward Area Air Defense\" (FAAD) program, known as the MIM-46 Mauler. Mauler was based on a modified M113 chassis carrying a large rotating A-frame rack on top with nine missiles and both long-range search and shorter-range tracking radars. Operation was to be almost entirely automatic, with the operators simply selecting targets from the search radar's display and then pressing \"fire\". The entire engagement would be handled by the fire control computer.\n\nIn testing the Mauler proved to have numerous problems. Many of these were relatively minor, including problems with the rocket motors or fins on the airframe, but others, like problems with the fire control and guidance systems, appeared to be more difficult to solve. Army strategy from the mid-1950s PENTANA study was based on having embedded mobile anti-aircraft capability, and Mauler's delays put this entire program in question. More worrying, a new generation of Soviet attack aircraft was coming into service. For both of these reasons the Mauler program was scaled back in 1963 and alternatives were studied.\n\nMICOM was directed to study whether or not the Navy's AIM-9D Sidewinder missile could be adapted for the ground-to-air role. Since the Sidewinder was guided by an infrared seeker, it would not be confused by ground clutter like the radar-guided Mauler. On the downside, the missile required some time to \"lock on\", and the current generation seekers were only able to lock onto the tail of an aircraft. MICOM's report was cautiously optimistic, concluding that the Sidewinder could be adapted very quickly, although it would have limited capability.\n\nA new concept, the \"Interim Forward Area Air Defense\" (IFAAD) evolved around the Sidewinder. The main concern was that at shorter distances the missile would not have time to lock onto the target before it flew out of range, so to serve this need a second vehicle based around the M61 Vulcan cannon was specified. Both would be aimed manually, eliminating the delay needed for a fire control system to develop a \"solution\". Neither vehicle concept had room for a search radar, so a separate radar system using datalink was developed for this role.\n\nThe studies were completed in 1965 and the Chaparral program was begun. The first XMIM-72A missiles were delivered to the US Army in 1967. Ford developed the M730 vehicle, adapted from the M548, itself one of the many versions of the widely used M113. The first Chaparral battalion was deployed in May 1969.\n\nA small target-acquisition area radar, the AN/MPQ-49 Forward Area Alerting Radar (FAAR), was developed in 1966 to support the Chaparral/Vulcan system, although the FAAR is transported by the Gama Goat and thus not suitable for use in the front line.\n\nThe MIM-72A missile was based on the AIM-9D Sidewinder. The main difference is that to reduce drag only two of the fins on the MIM-72A have rollerons, the other two having been replaced by fixed thin fins. The MIM-72's MK 50 solid-fuel rocket motor was essentially identical to the MK 36 MOD 5 used in the AIM-9D Sidewinder. The MIM-72 missile is launched from the M48 fire unit, consisting of a M730 tracked vehicle fitted with an M54 missile launcher capable of holding four missiles ready to fire. The M48 carries an additional eight missiles stowed.\n\nThe MIM-72A like the FIM-43 Redeye uses a first generation infra-red seeker, and can be fooled by flares and \"hot brick\" jammers, such as the L166 IRCM unit fitted to the Mi-24. Also the missile needs to be able to see the hot exhaust of an aircraft, making it a tail chase only missile. A similar B model for training was identical to the A model with the exception of a different warhead fuze.\n\nThe C version of the missile, from 1974, has an improved guidance section that gives the missile an all-aspect capability, as well as a new doppler radar fuze and an improved warhead. The fuze and warhead were adapted from the earlier Mauler program. C models were deployed between 1976 and 1981, reaching operational status in 1978. An experimental D model used the warhead from the C version with the seeker from the A model, but was not deployed.\n\nA naval version of the missile was also developed, based on the C version of the missile – the RIM-72C \"Sea Chaparral\". This was not adopted by the U.S. Navy, however it was exported to Taiwan.\n\nThe Chaparral system is manually fired by visually tracking the targets, slewing the missile carrier into the general direction, and waiting for the missile seekers to \"lock on\" to the target. It is not suitable for engaging helicopters \"popping up\" behind cover, for instance.\n\nIn 1977 Ford and Texas Instruments started a project to give the Chaparral a limited all-weather capability through the addition of a FLIR camera. The test firings in 1978 also used a new smokeless motor, which greatly improved visibility after firing and made it much easier to fire follow-up rounds. The testing proved successful, and the FLIR upgrades were carried out in September 1984. Existing missiles were upgraded with the new motor to become the MIM-72E, while new-build versions (otherwise identical) were known as the MIM-72F.\n\nA final upgrade adapted the greatly improved seeker from the FIM-92 Stinger to the MIM-72, starting in 1980. The Stinger's seeker is considerably more capable in terms of off-axis \"sighting,\" as well as being able to reject most common forms of jamming. Ford was contracted to deliver the resulting MIM-72G starting in 1982, and all existing missiles had been updated by the late 1980s. New-build G models followed between 1990 and 1991. By this point in time the system was already being removed from regular Army service, and being handed over to the National Guard.\n\nTwo export-only versions of the MIM-72 were also built, the MIM-72H which is an export version of the MIM-72F, and the MIM-72J, a MIM-72G with a downgraded guidance and control section.\n\nThe missile cost approximately $80,000 and M48 fire units $1.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1980358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980358", "title": "Relative deprivation", "text": "Relative deprivation\n\nRelative deprivation is the lack of resources to sustain the diet, lifestyle, activities and amenities that an individual or group are accustomed to or that are widely encouraged or approved in the society to which they belong. Measuring relative deprivation allows an objective comparison between the situation of the individual or group compared to the rest of society. Relative deprivation may also emphasise the individual experience of discontent when being deprived of something to which one believes oneself to be entitled, however emphasizing the perspective of the individual makes objective measurement problematic.\n\nIt is a term used in social sciences to describe feelings or measures of economic, political, or social deprivation that are relative rather than absolute. The term is inextricably linked to the similar terms poverty and social exclusion. The concept of relative deprivation has important consequences for both behavior and attitudes, including feelings of stress, political attitudes, and participation in collective action. It is relevant to researchers studying multiple fields in social sciences. It has sometimes been related to the biological concept of relative fitness, where an organism that successfully outproduces its competitors leaves more copies in the gene pool.\n\nSocial scientists, particularly political scientists and sociologists, have cited 'relative deprivation' (especially temporal relative deprivation) as a potential cause of social movements and deviance, leading in extreme situations to political violence such as rioting, terrorism, civil wars and other instances of social deviance such as crime. For example, some scholars of social movements explain their rise by citing grievances of people who feel deprived of what they perceive as values to which they are entitled. Similarly, individuals engage in deviant behaviors when their means do not match their goals.\n\nRecently, the opposite of relative deprivation, the concept of relative gratification has emerged in social psychology.\n\nIn one of the first formal definitions of the relative deprivation, Walter Runciman noted that there are four preconditions of relative deprivation (of object X by person A):\nRunciman distinguished between egoistic and fraternalistic relative deprivation. The former is caused by unfavorable social position when compared to other, better off members of a specific group (of which A is the member) and the latter, by unfavorable comparison to other, better off groups. Egoistic relative deprivation can be seen in the example of a worker who believes he should have been promoted faster and may lead that person to take actions intended to improve his position within the group; those actions are, however, unlikely to affect many people. Fraternalistic can be seen in the example of racial discrimination and are much more likely to result in the creation and growth of large social movement, like the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Another example of fraternalistic relative deprivation is the envy that teenagers feel towards the wealthy characters who are portrayed in movies and on television as being \"middle class\" or \"normal\" despite wearing expensive clothes, driving expensive cars, and living in mansions. Fraternalistic group deprivation has also been linked to voting behaviours, particularly in the case of voting for the far-right.\n\nDeprivation Theory is that people who are deprived of things deemed valuable in society, money, justice, status or privilege, join social movements with the hope of redressing their grievances. That is a beginning point for looking at why people join social movements; however, it is even more important to look at relative deprivation theory, a belief that people join social movement based on their evaluations of what they think they should have, compared with what others have. On the contrary, absolute deprivation is people's actual negative condition; relative deprivation is what people think they should have relative to what others have, or even compared with their own past or perceived future. Improved conditions fuel human desires for even better conditions and so can spark revolutions.\n\nFeelings of deprivation are relative, as they come from a comparison to social norms that are not absolute and usually differ from time and place. This differentiates relative deprivation from objective deprivation (also known as absolute deprivation or absolute poverty) - a condition that applies to all underprivileged people. This leads to an important conclusion: while the objective deprivation (poverty) in the world may change over time, relative deprivation will not, as long as social inequality persists and some humans are better off than others.\n\nConsider the following examples: in 1905 cars were a luxury, hence an individual unable to afford one would not feel or be viewed as deprived. In 2010, when cars are common in most societies, an individual unable to afford one is much more likely to feel deprived. In another example, mobile phones are common today, and many people may feel that they deserve to have one. Fifty years ago, when there were no mobile phones, such a sentiment would obviously not exist.\n\nRelative deprivation may be temporal; that is, it can be experienced by people that experience expansion of rights or wealth, followed by stagnation or reversal of those gains. Such phenomena are also known as \"unfulfilled rising expectations\".\n\nIn an example from the political realm, the lack of the right to vote is more likely to be felt as a deprivation by people who had it once than by the people who never had the opportunity to vote.\n\nSome sociologists, for instance Karl Polanyi, have argued that relative differences in economic wealth are more important than absolute deprivation, and that it is more significant in determining human quality of life. This debate has important consequences for social policy, particularly on whether poverty can be eliminated simply by raising total wealth or whether egalitarian measures are also needed.\n\nA specific form of relative deprivation is relative poverty. A measure of relative poverty defines poverty as being below some relative poverty line, such as households who earn less than 20% of the median income.\n\nCritique of this theory has pointed out that this theory fails to explain why some people who feel discontent fail to take action and join social movements. Counter-arguments include that some people are prone to conflict-avoidance, are short-term-oriented, and that imminent life difficulties may arise since there is no guarantee that life-improvement will result from social action.\n\n"}

Most were built prior to World War I and those that had not already sold most of their lots suffered considerable financial loss due to the dramatic downturn in real estate sales during the war. It is possible that this downturn discouraged any further creation of these developments after the war.\n\nResidence Parks were characterized by their use of conditions, covenants and restrictions (\"CC&R\"s) in order to ensure that the neighborhood reflected certain styles of architecture and standards of development. The restrictions frequently extended to the exclusion of certain racial minorities as was common for the period and locale. They typically included enhanced public spaces that ranged from entrance \"gateway\" structures to landscaped boulevards and park areas to clubhouses.\n\nThe idea that you did not have to pack up and go to a park but actually live in one was part of the attraction. Therefore, considerable attention was paid to the layout of streets, their width, the parkways, sidewalks, lighting, and an overall landscape plan often designed by a respected landscape architect. These embellishments and standards of development came with a price and therefore Residence Parks were marketed primarily to affluent buyers.\n\nBefore World War I, cities in North America typically did not zone land for development or have planning guidelines that determined what could be built where and in what form. The early conditions, covenants, and restrictions of Residence Parks were likely the precursor to the standard use of zoning and planning rules in cities today.\n\nThe impact of Residence Park \"living\" was felt for years in real estate developments. Attaching the word \"Park\" to the end of the name of a residential development became very popular and resulted in distorting its original meaning. Developers and real estate agents started to use the term Residence Park to assign the same prestige for just about every development being built. These later developments typically had none of the elements of the original Residence Parks. They were simply coordinated tract developments with, at most, trees planted in the parkways.\n\nIn recent decades (1980s - 1990s - ) some planned residential developments take on some of the ideas of the original Residence Parks. They have formal entrances with structure(s) and landscaping announcing you are entering the tract. They often have a carefully planned street layout that tends toward winding curves. Some include clubhouses and/or a central park. But many of these features are often at the demands of the local city when approving the project and consequently take on a generic city-park appearance. And since the developments are typically created by large companies looking to maximize the return on their investment, they build the houses too. As a result, there are often rows and rows of houses with minor variations.\n\nThe original Residence Parks are markedly different in that the developer typically installed the streets, the utilities, and the public spaces. Then they sold the lots individually and would often require the lot owners to submit architectural plans for review prior to building. The subjective review was to maintain a certain aesthetic standard and/or style for the development. There were also requirements such as minimum cost of construction of a new home, maximum height, number of structures per lot, property uses and so on. This resulted in a much richer variety in the architecture and a more visually appealing streetscape.\n\nSome Residence Parks still survive today and though most of the CC&Rs have expired, the streetscape and architecture has often survived to maintain the park-like atmosphere.\n\n"}

Christian Science was founded in the 19th century in Lynn, Massachusetts, by Mary Baker Eddy with the publication of her book \"Science and Health\" (1875).\n\nThe First Church of Christ, Scientist, is located in the 13.5-acre Christian Science Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts. The center is owned by the church and contains the Original Mother Church (1894); Mother Church Extension (1906); Christian Science Publishing House (1934), which houses the Mary Baker Eddy Library; Reflection Hall (1971); Administration Building (1972); and Colonnade Building (1972). There is also a reflecting pool and fountain.\n\nThe Original Mother Church, designed by Franklin I. Welch, was completed in December 1894, eight years after the first Christian Science church, First Church of Christ, Scientist (Oconto, Wisconsin), was built by local women who felt they had been helped by the religion.\n\nAlthough fairly large for the time, the original church, a Romanesque Revival stone structure, is often overlooked because it is dwarfed by the much larger domed Mother Church Extension. Designed to fit on a kite-shaped lot, the former features a 126-foot (38 m) steeple and an octagonal auditorium that seats 900. It is built of granite from New Hampshire, Mary Baker Eddy's home state.\n\nAdded in 1904–1906, the Mother Church Extension was originally designed by Charles Brigham, but was substantially modified by S. S. Beman, who took over construction in 1905 as a result of Brigham's illness. In particular, Beman minimized the Ottoman and Byzantine elements, bringing the domed structure in line with the Neoclassical style that Beman favored as most appropriate for Christian Science churches. It boasts one of the world's largest pipe organs, built in 1952 by the Aeolian-Skinner Company of Boston. The sanctuary, located on the second floor, seats around 3,000.\n\nDesigned in the 1960s by the firm I.M. Pei & Partners (Araldo Cossutta and I. M. Pei, design partners), the Christian Science Plaza along Huntington Avenue includes a large administration building, a colonnade, a reflecting pool and fountain, and Reflection Hall (the former Sunday School building). The site is one of Boston's most recognizable sites and a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe Mary Baker Eddy Library is housed on the site in an 11-story structure originally built for the Christian Science Publishing Society. Constructed between 1932 and 1934, the neoclassical-style building with its Mapparium, a walk-through inside-out globe of the world in 1934, has become an historic landmark in Boston's Back Bay. Restoration of the library's 81,000-square foot portion of the building began in 1998, and the final renovation and additional construction were completed in 2002.\n\nThe First Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as The Mother Church, has branch churches around the world. In accordance with the \"Manual of The Mother Church\", the Mother Church is the only Christian Science church to use the definite article (\"the\") in its title. Branch churches are named \"First Church of Christ, Scientist\", \"Second Church of Christ, Scientist\", and so on, followed by the name of the city, in the order in which they were built in that city (for example, Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, Chicago).\n\nCarol Norton, a student of Eddy's, and a practitioner and teacher of Christian Science, described the relationship between the First Church of Christ, Scientist and its branch churches as similar to the relationship between the federal government of the United States and the individual states. In his short booklet entitled \"The Christian Science Movement\", he states that branch churches are \"congregational in government, and individual and independent in the conduct of their own affairs, yet all accept the Tenets of the Mother Church.\"\n\n"}

(It is also used in monochromatic heraldic representations to indicate what the tincture of a \"full-colour\" emblazon would be.) When lines are placed at an angle to one another, it is called cross-hatching.\n\nHatching is especially important in essentially linear media, such as drawing, and many forms of printmaking, such as engraving, etching and woodcut. In Western art, hatching originated in the Middle Ages, and developed further into cross-hatching, especially in the old master prints of the fifteenth century. Master ES and Martin Schongauer in engraving and Erhard Reuwich and Michael Wolgemut in woodcut were pioneers of both techniques, and Albrecht Dürer in particular perfected the technique of crosshatching in both media.\n\nArtists use the technique, varying the length, angle, closeness and other qualities of the lines, most commonly in drawing, linear painting and engraving.\n\nThe main concept is that the quantity, thickness and spacing of the lines will affect the brightness of the overall image and emphasize forms creating the illusion of volume. Hatching lines should always follow (i.e. wrap around) the form. By increasing quantity, thickness and closeness, a darker area will result.\n\nAn area of shading next to another area which has lines going in another direction is often used to create contrast.\n\nLine work can be used to represent colors, typically by using the same type of hatch to represent particular tones. For example, red might be made up of lightly spaced lines, whereas green could be made of two layers of perpendicular dense lines, resulting in a realistic image.\n\nIn technical drawing, the section lining may indicate the material of a component part of an assembly. Many hatching patterns have been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO), though there are many other predefined patterns that may be used. Thus, the hatching pattern of steel varies from that of aluminum, copper, etc. The hatching patterns are not only for metals. Patterns for grass, gravel, brick, and others are frequently found on architectural drawings.\n\n\n"}

The town has a population of 4,546, while Opovo municipality has 10,475 inhabitants.\n\nIn Serbian, the town is known as \"Opovo\" (Опово), in German as \"Opowa\", in Hungarian as \"Ópáva\", in Croatian as \"Opovo\", in Romanian as \"Opovo\", in Slovak as \"Opovo\", and in Rusyn as Опово.\n\nThere are traces from Neolithic and Roman periods in this area. An older settlement named Želj existed at this locality during medieval Hungarian and later Ottoman administration. During Hungarian administration it was part of the Kovin county and during Ottoman administration part of the Temeşvar Eyalet. Southern part of modern Opovo is still called Želj by local inhabitants. According to historical sources, modern Opovo was mentioned first in 1672-1690 and it was populated by Serbs. They lived in the houses made from mud. During Ottoman administration, settlement had 27 houses and, after Habsburg conquest, in 1717, it had 64 houses. \n\nDuring Habsburg administration, Opovo firstly was part of the Banat of Temeswar (until 1751) and then part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. In 1753, Opovo was recorded as ethnic Serb settlement. In the second half of the 18th century (in 1769), Germans and Hungarians settled in Opovo. Serb elementary school in Opovo was opened in 1768, while German school was opened around 1773-4. Construction plan from 1776 predicted that 225 Serb and 60 Catholic houses would be built in the settlement. In 1782, settlement had population of 1,497 people. In the first half of the 19th century (1829–1831), Serbian Orthodox church of Saint Nikolaj was built. In 1848-1849, Opovo was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, but was returned under military administration in 1849. With the abolishment of Military Frontier in Banat (in 1873), Opovo was included into Torontál County, which was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. In 1885, new elementary school was elevated in the settlement. In 1910, Serbs were in an absolute majority in Opovo, while other ethnic groups that lived in the settlement included Germans, Croats and Hungarians.\n\nIn 1918, following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, Opovo firstly became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In 1918-1919 it was part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region. From 1918 to 1922 Opovo was part of Veliki Bečkerek county, from 1922 to 1929 part of Belgrade oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, it was occupied by German Axis troops and was included in the German-administered Banat region, which was part of Serbia. In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis troops from the region and Opovo was included into Autonomous Province of Vojvodina within new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1945, Vojvodina is part of the People's Republic of Serbia. Before World War II, Opovo was part of Kovačica municipality and, after the war, part of Pančevo municipality.

The last few years have been an exciting time in the world of IT auditing as a result of the accounting scandals and increased regulation. IT auditing has had a relatively short yet rich history when compared to auditing as a whole and remains an ever-changing field.\n\nThe introduction of computer technology into accounting systems changed the way data was stored, retrieved and controlled. It is believed that the first use of a computerized accounting system was at General Electric in 1954. During the time period of 1954 to the mid-1960s, the auditing profession was still auditing around the computer. At this time only mainframe computers were used and few people had the skills and abilities to program computers. This began to change in the mid-1960s with the introduction of new, smaller and less expensive machines. This increased the use of computers in businesses and with it came the need for auditors to become familiar with EDP concepts in business. Along with the increase in computer use, came the rise of different types of accounting systems. The industry soon realized that they needed to develop their own software and the first of the generalized audit software (GAS) was developed. In 1968, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) had the Big Eight (now the Big Four) accounting firms participate in the development of EDP auditing. The result of this was the release of \"Auditing & EDP\". The book included how to document EDP audits and examples of how to process internal control reviews.\n\nAround this time EDP auditors formed the Electronic Data Processing Auditors Association (EDPAA). The goal of the association was to produce guidelines, procedures and standards for EDP audits. In 1977, the first edition of \"Control Objectives\" was published. This publication is now known as Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (CobiT). CobiT is the set of generally accepted IT control objectives for IT auditors. In 1994, EDPAA changed its name to Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). The period from the late 1960s through today has seen rapid changes in technology from the microcomputer and networking to the internet and with these changes came some major events that change IT auditing forever.\n\nThe formation and rise in popularity of the Internet and E-commerce have had significant influences on the growth of IT audit. The Internet influences the lives of most of the world and is a place of increased business, entertainment and crime. IT auditing helps organizations and individuals on the Internet find security while helping commerce and communications to flourish.\n\nThere are five major events in U.S. history which have had significant impact on the growth of IT auditing. These are the Equity Funding scandal, the development of the Internet and E-commerce, the 1998 IT failure at AT&T Corporation, the Enron and Arthur Andersen LLP scandal, and the September 11, 2001 Attacks.\n\nThese events have not only heightened the need for more reliable, accurate, and secure systems but have brought a much needed focus to the importance of the accounting profession. Accountants certify the accuracy of public company financial statements and add confidence to financial markets. The heightened focus on the industry has brought improved control and higher standards for all working in accounting, especially those involved in IT auditing.\n\nThe first known case of misuse of information technology occurred at Equity Funding Corporation of America. Beginning in 1964 and continuing on until 1973, managers for the company booked false insurance policies to show greater profits, thus boosting the price of the stock of the company. If it wasn't for a whistle blower, the fraud may have never been caught. After the fraud was discovered, it took the auditing firm Touche Ross two years to confirm that the insurance policies were not real. This was one of the first cases where auditors had to audit through the computer rather than around the computer.\n\nIn 1998 AT&T suffered an IT failure that impacted worldwide commerce and communication. A major switch failed due to software and procedural errors and left many credit card users unable to access funds for upwards this brought to the forefront our reliance in IT services and reminds us of the need for assurance in our computer systems.\n\nThe Enron and Arthur Andersen LLP scandal led to the demise of a foremost Accounting firm, an investor loss of more than 60 billion dollars and the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Arthur Andersen was recently found guilty of obstruction of justice for their role in the collapse of the energy giant. This scandal had a significant impact on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and was a major self-regulation violation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1980468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980468", "title": "WROC-TV", "text": "WROC-TV\n\nWROC-TV, virtual channel 8 (UHF digital channel 21), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Rochester, New York, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WROC-TV's studios are located on Humboldt Street in downtown Rochester, and its transmitter is located on Pinnacle Hill in Brighton, New York.\n\nThe WROC-TV studios are host to the master control operations of Nexstar's \"virtual triopoly\" in the Quad Cities television market of southeastern Iowa and west-central Illinois which includes fellow CBS affiliate WHBF-TV, CW affiliate KGCW, and Fox-affiliated LMA partner KLJB.\n\nWROC-TV is Rochester's oldest television station, signing on June 11, 1949, as WHAM-TV, an NBC affiliate on channel 6. It was owned originally by Stromberg-Carlson, a telephone equipment manufacturer, along with WHAM radio. The station was also affiliated with the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. ()\n\nWHAM-TV moved to channel 5 on July 24, 1954, as part of a revision of upstate New York's VHF allotments resulting from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s \"Sixth Report and Order\" of 1952. However, WHAM-TV on channel 5 dealt with interference issues from CBLT, a CBC Television station from Toronto, after that station moved from its original channel 9 allocation to channel 6 in 1956. CBLT was replaced on channel 9 by CFTO-TV in 1960, and that channel relocation would later play an indirect role in the station's second frequency shift, eight years later.\n\nStromberg-Carlson merged with General Dynamics in 1955. General Dynamics was not interested in owning broadcast outlets, and put the WHAM radio and television outlets on the market. In 1956, WHAM-TV was sold to Transcontinent Broadcasting, which owned WGR radio and WGR-TV in Buffalo; the new owners changed the call letters to the current WROC-TV. In 1961, Transcontinent sold the station to Veterans Broadcasting Company, which subsequently sold its half of what is today WHEC-TV (channel 10) to the Gannett Company, then based in Rochester. The acquisition by Veterans Broadcasting also gave WROC-TV new sister stations on radio, as WVET-AM-FM (1280 AM and 97.9 FM) changed their call signs to WROC (AM) and WROC-FM. (The WHAM-TV callsign is now used on Rochester's ABC affiliate, channel 13, previously known as WOKR. Other than the shared callsign, that station is unrelated to the earlier WHAM-TV.)\n\nUnder Veterans' ownership, WROC-TV moved to channel 8 on September 8, 1962, as part of another channel allocation change, this one being a switch involving Rochester and Syracuse. The FCC moved WROC-TV's former channel 5 east to Syracuse, and it was taken by Meredith Corporation-owned WHEN-TV (now WTVH), which was previously on channel 8. The move also allowed a new station on channel 9 to enter the Syracuse market; it signed-on as WNYS-TV (later WIXT-TV and now WSYR-TV) the following day.\n\nVeterans Broadcasting was merged into Rust Craft Broadcasting in February 1965. Rust Craft sold its television unit to Ziff Davis in 1979. This resulted in the breakup of the WROC stations, as WROC (AM) and WPXY were later sold by Rust-Craft to members of the firm's broadcast management team. Within a few years, however, Ziff Davis broke up its television group; WROC-TV and sister stations in Saginaw, Michigan, Augusta, Georgia and Steubenville, Ohio were spun-off to Television Station Partners LP, a group composed of Ziff Davis's broadcast executives, in 1983. Television Station Partners sold channel 8, along with the Saginaw and Steubenville outlets, to Smith Broadcasting in 1996. Nexstar then purchased WROC-TV in 1999.\nIt was while under the stewardship of Television Station Partners that WROC-TV made another switch: In April 1989, NBC announced it would end its 40-year partnership with channel 8 and move its Rochester affiliation to then-CBS station WHEC-TV. This move was the result of the station's poor performance and constant preemptions of NBC network programming (NBC was very intolerant of preemptions at this time, and was the number one network at the time, adding to NBC's aggravation with channel 8). WROC-TV agreed to terms to affiliate with CBS in May, and channel 8 soon began airing CBS's Saturday morning children's programs (with the notable exception of \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\") and daytime game shows \"Family Feud\" and \"Now You See It\", all of which had been preempted by WHEC-TV. Channel 8 began airing the full CBS schedule on August 13, 1989.\n\nFor many years, WROC-TV was one of three Rochester area stations offered on cable in the Ottawa–Gatineau and Eastern Ontario regions. The Rochester area stations were replaced with Detroit stations when the microwave relay system that provided these signals was discontinued. Until January 2009, WROC-TV was also available in many Central Ontario communities such as Belleville, Cobourg, and Lindsay.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, WROC-TV replaced Louisville's WLKY on Time Warner Cable systems in that station's region, when WLKY's owners, Hearst Television, pulled its stations off Time Warner Cable's systems in a retransmission dispute. However, Nexstar complained that Time Warner Cable has used their signals outside their markets without permission, while Time Warner Cable was within its rights to use their signals as replacements until a deal with Hearst is reached. WROC-TV, for its part, made the best of its predicament, naming the administrator of a Facebook group of tongue-in-cheek Louisvillean WROC-TV fans its fan of the week and making a handful of other shout-outs to its emerging Louisville fanbase. The substitution of WROC-TV in place of WLKY lasted until July 19, 2012, when a deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn June 15, 2016, Nexstar announced that it has entered into an affiliation agreement with Katz Broadcasting for the Escape, Laff, Grit, and Bounce TV networks, bringing one or more of the four networks to 81 stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar, including WROC-TV. As a result, WROC-TV added two additional subchannels carrying Escape and Laff on August 20, 2016 (At the time of the agreement, Grit was available in Rochester on WHAM-DT3).\n\nWROC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, at 11:35 p.m. on June 12, 2009 (following the late newscast), the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 45. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 8.\n\nSyndicated programming on WROC-TV includes \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\", \"Inside Edition\", and \"The Dr. Oz Show\". All are distributed by CBS Television Distribution.\n\nIn August 1957, WROC-TV began airing the area's first 11 o'clock broadcast called \"Eleventh Hour News\". Regular sports segments were added to the show on April 7, 1958. WROC-TV enjoyed ratings dominance with popular anchorman Tom Decker and weatherman Bob Mills. Anne Keefe, another well-known talent who split time between WROC radio and TV, contributed to the station's success in the 1960s and 1970s. However, by the mid-1970s, Decker, Mills and Keefe left. The loss of these popular veteran broadcasters and the station's failure to keep up with changing technology lead to a ratings slump that lasted more than three decades.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s through the early 2000s, WROC-TV's newscasts struggled in the Nielsen ratings, usually placing a distant third behind WOKR/WHAM-TV and WHEC-TV. Even with the strong NBC prime time lineup in the mid-to-late 1980s (the last few years of WROC-TV's affiliation contract with NBC) and the CBS lineup during the early 2000s, its newscasts remained stubbornly in third place. However, after finally establishing some stability with its anchor team, market share has been growing over the course of the past decade. In the November 2008 ratings period, WROC-TV's 11 p.m. newscast finished ahead of slumping WHEC-TV for the first time in many years.\n\nAfter becoming operated by Nexstar, WUHF's separate news department was shut down. Two anchors, a producer, and a photographer were added to WROC-TV's news staff. The remainder of its personnel was laid-off in this move. On September 1, 2005, a nightly half-hour prime time broadcast (produced by WROC-TV) called \"Fox First at 10\" began airing on WUHF. Originating from a secondary set at this station's facilities, the show eventually expanded to 45 minutes followed by a fifteen-minute sports highlight program known as \"Sports Extra\". On September 13, 2010, this station began airing a weekday 4 p.m. newscast for a half-hour (an area first). As of 2011, WROC-TV's newscasts remain in third place overall. On September 4, 2012, WROC-TV became the second Rochester area TV station to have upgraded its local newscasts to high definition. The 10 p.m. newscast on WUHF was included in the upgrade. WROC's relationship with WUHF ended in December 2013 due to Sinclair's purchase of the assets of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV (along with the sale of its license to an affiliated company), and the re-location of WUHF to its facilities. WUHF's 10 p.m. newscast was replaced by a WHAM-produced version on January 1, 2014. \n\n\n"}

Previously, the station could only hold six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000.\n\nThis elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is not used in revenue service. The southern half of the platforms has beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and support columns while the northern half has black, steel, waist high fences and lampposts. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering.\n\nThe 1991 artwork here, by Wopo Holup, is called \"Elevated Nature I-IV\".

Both platforms have a station house, but only the southbound one is active. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase going down to 225th Street and the northwest corner of Broadway. Access to and from the northbound platform is via two full-height turnstiles, one exit-only and the other entry-exit, and one staircase going down to the east side of Broadway across from the northwest corner of 225th Street.\n\nThis station is less than from the Marble Hill station on Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line. Just south of the station, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line crosses the Broadway Bridge onto the island of Manhattan.\n\nThis station today and the neighborhood it serves reside on the north shore of the Harlem River Ship Canal, also known as Spuyten Duyvil Creek, and are thus geographically on the mainland. However, the neighborhood was formerly part of the island of Manhattan. The canal was constructed in 1895, separating the neighborhood from the rest of the island. After the original creek bed was filled in, Marble Hill became part of the mainland, although it is still considered part of Manhattan for administrative and political purposes.\n\n"}

It was built on a site fronting the Antrim Road. A board of trustees took charge in 1900 to oversee the development of the growing school and, when they renamed it in 1942 in memory of its founder, they adopted the word \"Esperance (Hope)\" as the school's motto from the Wallace coat of arms. \n\nThe post-war years witnessed rapid growth in pupil numbers and consequent accommodation provision. Land was purchased at Clonevin Park, initially for playing fields, and when the Antrim Road site proved inadequate, the decision was taken to build a new school in these extensive grounds.\n\nPupils and staff moved to the new building in 1976, and today the school has expanded to 1160 pupils in the grammar school and 200 in the preparatory department.\n\nThe Wallace High School underwent construction on a new school expansion project.

It was written by Sezen Aksu, with music credited as composed by Tarkan. However, Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu's consent, who was the true copyright owner. It formed part of Tarkan's album \"Ölürüm Sana\". \"Şımarık\" was released in France in 1998 and the rest of the world in 1999, from the compilation album \"Tarkan\", which was released in Europe. It has sold two million copies all across Europe. Many versions of the song were recorded in different languages, most notably the English-language cover, titled \"Kiss Kiss\", by Greek-American singer Stella Soleil in 2001 which was itself covered by Australian actress Holly Valance in 2002.\n\nAs Tarkan's first major single, the song is generally considered his debut single. He had released three albums before this, but never released a song in single format due to the album-orientated nature of the Turkish music industry. The song has also appeared in soundtracks of various movies, including French film \"Beau travail\" and the American film \"XX/XY\". It is generally considered Tarkan's signature song in Europe. Its chorus ends with two characteristic kiss sounds.\n\nThe music video is shot in Marseille, France with narrow streets and cobbled roads, with Tarkan singing and jaywalking. Several females on the streets see him and start following him to try to kiss him, but he tries to avoid them by first changing direction and then later by walking faster. More and more women begin to follow him as the song proceeds, but Tarkan eventually starts running in order to avoid them. A big group of women then run after him and as the song finishes, Tarkan takes cover in a street corner. A young girl is there as well and Tarkan kisses her forehead.\n\nTrack lists to this CD single change depending on the country of release, e.g. America and Germany.\n\nThere were four promotional LP versions released.\nA promotional CD single was released in France, with an orange cover. This was the first ever release and included one track. This is now a collector's item. There was also a limited edition (fan-edition) single released in Germany, which came with a poster of Tarkan.\n\nWhen the single was released in Europe, it reached No. 1 in Belgium, No. 2 in Norway, plus No. 3 in Switzerland, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Sales went gold in Europe, where Tarkan was presented with his gold disc at Cannes Midem and in Germany by Universal and platinum in Latin America where it knocked Enrique Iglesias off the top slot.\n\n\"Şımarık\" was featured in films and soap opera including \"Beau travail\", \"Romané\" and \"XX/XY\".\n\n\"Şımarık\" was using with sound effect of Tarkan kiss sounds including in several Chilean television program including: \"Calle 7\", \"Yingo\", \"En portada\", \"Buenos Días a Todos\", \"Muy buenos días\", \"Mucho gusto\", \"Gente como tú\", \"La mañana de Chilevisión\" and others.\n\n\"Kiss Kiss\" is the debut single by American recording artist Stella Soleil. The single is a cremake of the Turkish song \"Şımarık\" by Tarkan with new lyrics. The English version was credited to by Juliette Jaimes, Sezen Aksu, Tarkan, and Steve Welton-Jaimes. The single was released to mainstream radio in April 2001. The single was also released in regions of Europe, excluding the UK.\n\nThe music video is set on the beach during the late night. The video (directed by Hype Williams) shows Soleil dancing on the sand, while scenes go back and forth from birds eye views of landscape around the beach.\n\n\n\"Kiss Kiss\" is the debut recording by Australian actress Holly Valance. Her version is a remake of the 2001 song of the same name by Stella Soleil, itself a remake of \"Şımarık\" by Tarkan. The single was released in April 2002 in Australia and United Kingdom, and shot straight to number one in both countries.\n\nThe official music video for Holly Valance’s version features a compilation of Valance herself with a variety of different looks and sexualised outfits whilst performing the song. \n\nThe video opens with a close-up of Holly's lips, painted with a burnished red gloss, as she mimes a kiss at the viewer. Lightbulbs flash and pulse on a black background, gradually illuminating Holly's apparently-naked figure, save for two bars of light across her chest and hips.\n\nOnce the music starts to build, Holy is next shown within a second black room, this time surrounded by blue rectangular strips of light. In this scene Holly wears a plaited hairstyle, white underwear and a white cropped jacket. During the video these lights change to red before returning to their original color.\n\nAs Holly begins to sing the view returns to the opening close-up scene, before cutting to show her sat within and surrounded by a black velvet structure. The room is illuminated further by a mosaic background pattern of flashing white lights. In this environment she has winged eyeliner, hoop earrings, and a purple top & shorts with her hair down. Between shots two DJ's are seen using a record table. \n\nDuring the chorus the scene shifts to show Holly with six male backing dancers on a black and gold backdrop. This time Holly's hair is wet and she is wearing a shiny wet-look top and hi-leg shorts, both featuring black sequins. The video switches between each of these settings throughout the video.\n\nThe single also debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2002, selling 143,408 copies in its first week. The song made its debut on the Australian ARIA Charts, UK Singles Chart and Turkish Singles Chart at number one, it was Valance's first number one single. It went on to spend nine weeks in the ARIA Charts top ten, thirteen weeks in the top twenty and a total of seventeen weeks in the top fifty. In countries like Ireland, Finland, Italy and Taiwan the song went to peak in the top ten. It also reached the Top 20 in Austria, Greece, Sweden, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Denmark. It was certified Platinum by the ARIA and Gold by the BPI.\n\n\"Kiss Kiss\" was nominated for four ARIA Awards at the 16th ARIA Awards in 2002.\n\n\n\n\nAside from \"Kiss Kiss\", there were many other covers of \"Şımarık\" in English and various languages, like a version sung by Hong Kong group E02 in Cantonese and an Egyptian cover version sung by Samy Mansour. Notable covers include:\n\n\nAn alternative release of the DJ R'AN version of \"Kiss Kiss\" was done in 2017 by Kosovar-German singer Ardian Bujupi with Dj R'AN featuring Mohombi and Big Ali.\n\nOther samplings\n\n"}

The district is bounded by Hoover Street on the west to Glendale Boulevard on the east, the US 101 Freeway on the north and Beverly Boulevard on the south. Temple Street is the neighborhood's main thoroughfare. This section of Echo Park was separated from its northern portion by the US 101 Freeway in the 1950s and the southern section of the park where the tennis courts and baseball field are located. Originally the area known as Little Manila, Historic Filipinotown was one of the first areas to be cultivated by Filipino immigrants during the early part of the 20th century. The enclave was created through a resolution proposed by council member Eric Garcetti on August 2, 2002.\n\nThe district is the first official geographic designation by any city outside of the Philippines honoring Filipinos. From a political and community planning standpoint, Historic Filipinotown is in the city of Los Angeles’ Thirteenth District, represented by council member Mitch O'Farrell. It overlaps and is divided by the two larger communities of Silver Lake and Echo Park. Historic Filipinotown was created to help preserve the history of this part of the neighborhood and promote economic, civic, commercial, cultural, industrial and educational interests and common wealth of local residents, business owners and other stakeholders. Community plans drawn up for Historic Filipinotown also impact the community plans of Silver Lake-Echo Park and a small section of the Westlake neighborhood south of Beverly Boulevard. As a result, Historic Filipinotown competes with these other localities for services and benefits while avoiding any conflict with their larger community parents.\n\nFilipino Americans represent the largest population of Asian Americans in California and also have one of the oldest communities of Asian Americans in the United States. The earliest settlement can be found in enclaves such as Manila Village in Jefferson Parish and St. Malo in St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana which were founded in 1763, became part of Spanish Louisiana and became home to approximately 2,000 Filipino sailors and laborers. With houses platformed on stilts, the fishermen caught and dried their precious commodity, shrimp, for export to Asia, Canada, South and Central America. They introduced innovations such as \"dancing the shrimp\" and shrimp farming to the United States. Weather conditions eventually destroyed St. Malo in 1915 and Manila Village in 1965. On July 24, 1870, the Spanish-speaking residents of St. Malo founded the first Filipino social club called Sociedad de Beneficencia de los Hispano Filipinos to provide relief and support for the group’s members, including the purchasing of burial places for their deceased.\n\nDespite the fact that there are other enclaves of Filipinos living outside this district (such as Carson,Long Beach, Glendale, Cerritos, West Covina, Panorama City, and Eagle Rock), it was named \"Historic Filipinotown\" since it was one of the few areas where Filipinos first settled during the early part of the 20th century and home to key Filipino organizations, Filipino churches (Filipino Christian Church, Iglesia ni Kristo, St. Columban Filipino Catholic Church, United Church of God Ministries, Praise Christian Fellowship and Congregational Christian Church), housing (Manila Terrace, Mindanao Towers, Mountain View Terrace, and Villa Ramos), and social service centers. Many Filipino American families began purchasing homes and establishing businesses in the area beginning from the 1940s, shifting away from the downtown area now known as Little Tokyo in the 1920s and later the Bunker Hill area.\n\nIn a section of downtown Los Angeles now known as Little Tokyo, a thriving community known as Little Manila existed and flourished for over two decades (1920s-40s). The first significant wave of Filipino migration came in 1923, when over 2,000 arrived in California. Ten years later, over 6,000 resided in Los Angeles, most living in the downtown neighborhood bordered by San Pedro Street to the east, Sixth Street to the south, Figueroa Street to the west, and Sunset Boulevard to the North. Twelve restaurants, seven barbershops, the immigrant newspaper \"The Philippines Review\" and the Manila Portrait Studio all helped to buoy the Los Angeles Filipino diaspora. Many of the Filipino pioneers came to Los Angeles to study, while others settled as residents for employment. This community of mostly males established numerous restaurants, pool halls, cafés, employment agencies and barbershops which became the hub where Filipinos congregated, lived, socialized, organized and networked among their compatriots to find companionship, fellowship and work. One would merely drive to First and Main Streets to solicit Filipinos, either by Hollywood studios in need of ethnic-type extras for cinematic productions or many others in need of cheap labor.\n\nWhile gambling and taxi dance halls provided the overwhelmingly male Filipino community with distraction from their grinding labor, these activities drew condemnation from some quarters within Little Manila. Boxing, however, drew no such criticism; moreover, it brought a diverse population—sometimes divided ethnically between Ilocanos, Visayans, Tagalogs and Boholanos—together into one experience. \"They didn't care if a person was Visayan, Ilocano, Boholano, Cebuano,\" notes Stockton's Jerry Paular. When a Filipino boxer emerged victorious, \"Ilocano was embracing the Visayan and the Tagalog.\" In Los Angeles, Johnny Samson, one of only two Filipino boxing trainers at the time, served as chairman of the L.A. Filipino Unity Council. Boxing would prove to be one of the most influential and lasting forms of attraction among Filipinos in California. Some historians also believe that Filipinos in Los Angeles were the original wearers of zoot suits. According to Rudy Estrada, an original Zoot Suiter who was attacked while walking in downtown Los Angeles in 1944, “Chicanos didn’t invent the Zoot Suit style; it was the Filipinos. Ducktail hairdos—Filipinos started that, too.”\n\nIn recent times the population of Historic Filipinotown has changed to reflect the ethnically diverse nature of Los Angeles. While the district still has a sizable Filipino population, they are the minority, overshadowed by a sizable Mexican-American and Central America]n population. Nevertheless, the area still has one of the highest concentrations of Filipino Americans in Southern California and still remains the cultural heart of Filipinos throughout Los Angeles. Of the 600,000 Filipinos that reside in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, an estimated 10,000 live within Historic Filipinotown. Nearby Chinatown also has about the same number of Chinese residents living within their own district. Though the population of Historic Filipinotown, or \"Hi-Fi\" (Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti's preferred shorthand moniker), is roughly 25 percent Filipino, it still boasts a higher ratio of Filipinos than nearby Koreatown has Koreans (15 percent) and Thai Town has Thais (less than 5 percent).\n\nThe “Historic” label was added to recognize the area as a gateway and the current place where Filipino immigrants settle, create businesses and have community-based activities. This was because the Filipino American community in Historic Filipinotown created a partnership with mayor Eric Garcetti, as a result, he maintained a staff position assigned to the Historic Filipinotown neighborhood during his tenure.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Filipinos were able to buy land in the United States. In Los Angeles, many Filipino families bought their first homes in the Temple-Beverly corridor, with the growth of Filipino families in this corridor, they created Filipino-owned businesses, establishments, churches, and organizations.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, Historic Filipinotown was officially recognized as one of the nation’s Preserve America Communities after years of advocacy by the Pilipino American Network and Advocacy (PANA) and other community advocates. Receiving this honor from former First Lady and Honorary Chair of the Preserve America Initiative, Michelle Obama, Historic Filipinotown is provided with strong federal support and incentives for the continued preservation of cultural and natural heritage resources. As a Preserve America Community, Historic Filipinotown is featured in the National Register Travel Itineraries and in “Teaching with Historic Places” curricular materials created by the National Park Service.\n\nOn January 28, 2012, representatives from Preserve America and the California State Historic Preservation, as well as various elected officials and community leaders, gathered at Unidad Park for “Preserving Historic Filipinotown: A Community Celebration.” In addition to the official ceremony of Historic Filipinotown’s Preserve America designation, this celebration also honored the restoration of the mural at Unidad Park, as well as the designation of Remedios “Remy” V. Geaga Square, located at the intersection of Alvarado Street and Temple Street.\n\nAlthough the enclave is named “Historic Filipinotown,” the Hispanic or Latino community comprises a majority of the population. In 2016, the population of Historic Filipinotown consisted of 4% Blacks, 8% Non-Hispanic Whites, 32% Asians, and 56% Hispanic or Latinos.\n\nIn Historic Filipinotown, the healthcare and social assistance category comprises nearly half of the total number of existing jobs. According to the 2015 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, healthcare and social assistance comprise 47% of the total jobs; accommodation and food services at 10%; management at 9%; and professional, scientific, and technical at 9%. These four categories compose the four largest percentage of total jobs within Historic Filipinotown. A trend that can be seen throughout the Filipino community is a tendency to work in healthcare professions. Fulfilling the demand for healthcare professionals in the U.S. many Filipino healthcare professionals immigrated to the U.S. The high number of individuals in the healthcare profession on the graph can be explained by this.\n\nAccording to the 2016 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS), the poverty rate of Filipinotown is higher than Los Angeles County. The poverty rate for the Los Angeles County is 18% while the poverty rate for Historic Filipinotown is 24%.\n\nThere are several organizations based in the Historic Filipinotown area. These include:\n\nSearch to Involve Pilipino Americans (SIPA)\nSIPA, Search to Involve Pilipino Americans, was founded in 1972 and helps to provide health and human services as well as helps in the economic development, arts and cultural programs for youth and families in Filipinotown and the greater Los Angeles Fil-Am community.\n\nFilipino American Services Group, Inc. (FASGI)\nFASGI, incorporated in 1981, is a “community based on non-profit social service agency that focuses on the health and well being of undeserved adults, particularly senior citizens…”\n\nHistoric Filipinotown Neighborhood Council (HIFNC)\nThe Historic Filipinotown Neighborhood Council (HIFINC) leads the effort for cultural, political and economic development in the district.\n\nFilipino American Community of Los Angeles, Inc. (FACLA)\nOriginally founded as the Filipino Unity Council in 1930, the Filipino American Community of Los Angeles (FACLA) is housed in the Filipino Cultural Center located on 1740 W. Temple Street.\n\nPilipino Workers Center (PWC)\nThe Pilipino Workers Center aims to \"secure the dignity and safety of the Pilipinx community in Southern California and build labor leaders in the domestic worker industry\". They were established in 1997.\n\nThere are three major annual events in Historic Filipinotown: the Historic Filipinotown Festival, the Philippine Independence Day Parade and Festival, and the Christmas Lantern Parade and Festival. \nSince 2006, the Historic Filipinotown Neighborhood Council, in an attempt to ‘re-Filipinize’ the neighborhood, throws a festival and fundraising campaign.\n\nThe Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) in partnership with LA-based social enterprise Public Matters, has an event called Hidden Hi Fi which shines light on the neighborhood assets through different events and Jeepney tours.\n\nThe Filipino American Library sponsors several bus tours throughout the year that include visiting Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana in Unidad Park.\n\nOver 31 \"polemount\" Parols are installed along Temple St. coinciding with festivities in the Philippines, the longest celebration of Christmas in the world. In addition a parade of parols, or Christmas lantern are paraded during the last day of Simbang Gabi which are a series of masses in the Philippines which are held from December 16–24.\n\n“By the early 1950s, Filipinos were able to buy land in America, and many Filipino families in Los Angeles purchased their first homes in the Temple-Beverly corridor. Filipino-owned businesses, establishments, churches, and organizations flourished in the corridor throughout the years, resulting in the community's attachment to a place. The relatively recent designation of Historic Filipinotown is representative of this attachment.\n\nOn May 5, 1998, the Los Angeles City Council designated the Filipino Christian Church as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 651.\n\nThe Filipino (Disciples) Christian Church is the only historic cultural monument designated by the City of Los Angeles with Filipino origins, distinguished by its German Gothic Revival and Craftsman architecture. The Disciples of Christ State Board adopted the work with the Filipinos as its mission and called on Rev. and Mrs. Frank Stipp, former missionaries to the Ilocos provinces, to oversee the work. Through them and the Disciples of Christ State Board, a center was later started when the Disciples secured for the Filipino Christian Fellowship four bungalows complete with apartment facilities and a place of worship located at First Street and Bunker Hill, where the Los Angeles Music Center and Walt Disney Concert Hall stand today. It is believed that these quarters sparked the start of what is known now as Historic Filipinotown. Having been the earliest Christian church established to cater to Filipino Americans, many key organizations in the area germinated from this church, including SIPA and the Filipino American Library.\nPurchased in part by funds donated by Philippines First Lady Aurora Quezon as a gift to the Filipinos in Los Angeles, the St. Columban Filipino Church on Beverly Blvd and Loma Drive has authentic church bells from the City of Antipolo, Philippines. The church sits on Crown Hill, one of the five hills that circled early downtown Los Angeles. In the 1890s, Crown Hill was the epicenter of a massive oil boom when Edward L. Doheny and Charles A. Canfield bought a lot at Colton Street and Glendale Boulevard and, in November 1892, they struck oil.\n\nBefore the area was designated as Historic Filipinotown, on June 24, 1995, the nation's largest Filipino American mural, \"Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana (Filipino Americans: A Glorious History, A Golden legacy)\", was unveiled. The mural promotes ethnic solidarity and the fight for historical inclusion of the ‘forgotten’ or ‘invisible’ Filipinos in American history. For example, the mural includes Larry Itliong who challenged young Filipino American activists to organize themselves to fight for equality in the 1960s and fought alongside Cesar Chavez to lead the Delano Grape Strike groups (Kim, 1999). The mural also includes apl.de.ap, who is a hip hop performer, rapper, producer, and composer.\n\nIn 1997, the City of Los Angeles Board of Cultural Affairs Commissioners awarded the mural its first ever Award of Design Excellence for public art. The mural was likewise featured in Los Angeles County Museum of Art's \"Made in California: Art, Image and Identity 1900-200\", the Smithsonian Institution's traveling exhibition celebrating 100 years of Filipino migration to the United States called \"Singgalot (The Ties That Bind): From Colonial Subjects to Citizens\" and the Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition \"I Want the Wide American Earth\" honoring the history and contributions of Asian and Pacific Islanders in the United States. The mural was painted by then 22-year-old artist Eliseo Art Silva while a junior attending Otis College of Art and Design. According to the artist, \"...the mural encapsulates 5,000 years of Filipino and Filipino American history; the design is divided into two parts: the first is historical (represented by the outline of a fish at sea), leading up to the awakening of Filipino national and political consciousness; the second part is dominated by a huge bird with significant Filipino-Americans on its wings, the farm workers on the bottom left and the youth and community on the right.\"\n\nThe mural originally faced a large community garden called the Candy Chuateco Community Garden. Sponsored by Search to Involve Pilipino Americans, The land was purchased by the City of Los Angeles and converted into the Unidad Park through the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust (LANLT). Unidad Park's design was conceptualized by leaders and stakeholders of the Filipino community and based largely from submitted renderings by the mural artist Eliseo Silva, which includes the Philippine Bontoc/Kankana-ey communal gathering place, park features and a community garden referencing the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as an entrance walkway based on a design by Filipino American Pedro Flores. The park is a destination for the neighborhood with its \"Dap-ay\" used by students and the sandbox inside this space used by toddlers, the interactive play area, community garden as well as onsite barbecue grills with matching tables and benches for family gatherings and parties, enhanced by a covered tent to protect park users from the sun and rain.\nIn 2007, Caltrans and the Historic Filipinotown Neighborhood Council (HIFINC), with financial support from the community, installed Historic Filipinotwn signage along the US 101 Freeway directing traffic to the area with the Alvarado and Glendale Boulevard exits. The crosswalks in Filipinotown have been decorated with traditional Filipino basket-weaving patterns designed by Edwin Frederizo, who also designed the district's street banners. \"My design for the permanent art display conveys a message of peace, unity, and harmony amongst the community of Historic Filipinotown. The uniqueness of having Filipino American residents and businesses embedded within a variety of cultures allows for a very rich and conceptual visual art display. The Filipino American culture is influenced by several other cultures (Latino, Chinese and African American) and is fused into a very unique style all its own.\"\n\nIn 2007, Caltrans and the Historic Filipinotown Neighborhood Council (HIFINC), with financial support from the community, installed Historic Filipinotown signage along the US 101 Freeway. The Hi-Fi sign directs traffic to the area with the Alvarado and Glendale Boulevard exits and marks the western gateway into the enclave. In addition, there are street signs that indicate the boundaries of Historic Filipinotown above the normal street signs such as the sign located on the northern border on Temple Street.\n\nHi-Fi Streetlight Art\nAlong the streets of Historic FilipinoTown are lamp posts adorned with Filipino cultural medallions. These medallions decorate the tops of lamp posts with different symbols. Roel Punzalan is the artist who designed the streetlight art. His vision for the project was to tie the Filipino values of “kapwa,” “lakbay,” and “kapayapaan” to the unique interaction of Filipino culture and Historic FilipinoTown. The streetlight art served both as an educational opportunity to share Filipino culture and history and as a way to improve pedestrian safety. Streetlights were placed at 17 different intersections, and about 54 lamp posts were adorned with Punzalan’s art.\n\nThe Filipino cultural values can be defined as followed: “kapwa” is “shared humanity or togetherness,” “lakbay” is “journey,” and “kapayapaan” is “peace”. These are the descriptions for each streetlight art:\n\nPunzalan explained that the streetlights highlight the importance of humanity in the Filipino culture and that the people are essential for the culture to last through the challenges and passage of time.\n\nIn November 2006, Eric Garcetti, then-president of the Los Angeles City Council, joined Filipino veterans from around the country in unveiling the first monument dedicated to the 250,000 Filipino and 7,000 Filipino American soldiers who fought for the United States in World War II. The monument, located in Lake Street Park in the heart of Historic Filipinotown, consists of five slabs of polished black granite and commemorates the history of the Filipino veterans, from WWII to immigration to their subsequent fight for equality. It was designed by artist Cheri Gaulke and the project was led by Joe Bernardo, a former staffer of Eric Garcetti. Inscribed in the front of the memorial is the quote, “Bataan was not our last battlefield. We are still fighting for equity,” by Faustino “Peping” Baclig. Baclig, a survivor of the Bataan death march and longtime leader of the movement to gain financial and medical benefits for the veterans comments on the longstanding battle that the Filipino community would face to gain recognition and equality in the country.\n\nLike the rest of the city of Los Angeles, the area is within the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nSamahang Pilipino Advancing Community Empowerment (SPACE)\nSamahang Pilipino Advancing Community Empowerment (SPACE) is an access project created in 2000 by Samahang Pilipino at UCLA, the official student organization for the Pilipino and Pilipino American communities at UCLA. SPACE addresses and alleviate the barriers to higher education for at-risk, historically underrepresented, underserved high school and community college students in the Los Angeles area. Through peer tutoring, peer advising. student workshops, parent workshops, and field trips, SPACE promotes “academic success, personal well-being, community engagement, and the formulation of solid post-secondary plans”.\n\nSPACE was partnered with Belmont High School until 2017. Belmont High School is located in Historic Filipinotown, next to downtown Los Angeles. College students from SPACE engaged with high school students working to holistically empower them, providing different developments that range in topic from academics, politics, intergenerational dialogue and culture. SPACE recognizes the need to supplement academic education with cultural education in order to contextualize the student experience and to empower them.\n\nThe group (SPACE) hosted Philipine Youth Empowerment Day, an event that featured workshops focused on Filipino-American history, identity and representation in the media. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1980502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980502", "title": "Seán Brady", "text": "Seán Brady\n\nSeán Baptist Brady KGCHS (born 16 August 1939) is an Irish cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh from 1996 until 2014, being elevated to the cardinalate in 2007. He faced repeated calls to resign over his role in an alleged cover-up of child abuse by priests in his jurisdiction.\n\nSeán Brady was born in Drumcalpin, near Laragh, County Cavan, to Andrew (d. 1968) and Annie (d. 1990) Brady. One of three children, he has a brother, Con, and a sister, Kitty. He attended Caulfield National School in Laragh and St Patrick's College in Cavan.\n\nIn 1957 he entered Maynooth College where he later obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Ancient Classics in 1960. He then proceeded to study in Rome at the Pontifical Irish College and Pontifical Lateran University, where he earned a Licentiate in Sacred Theology in 1964. He received a Doctorate in Canon Law at the Lateran University in 1967.\n\nBrady was ordained to the priesthood by Luigi Traglia on 22 February 1964. Finishing his studies at the Pontifical Lateran University, he there earned a doctorate in canon law in 1967. \n\nOn his return to Ireland in 1967 he was appointed to the staff of his \"alma mater\" of St. Patrick's in Cavan where he remained until 1980. He taught a variety of subjects including Latin, Commerce, Religion, and French, as well as training college football teams at all age levels. \n\nWhile he was teaching at the school, in 1975, he was present when children signed vows of silence over allegations against a paedophile priest. One of the victims gave him a list of other children being abused by Father Brendan Smyth, who was convicted in 1994 of dozens of offences over a 40-year period. In his capacity as a notary, he handed over signed statements from the witnesses to his bishop, but did not notify civil authorities. Commenting on coverage of these events in 2012, Brady said that the BBC programme \"This World\" had \"set out to deliberately exaggerate and misrepresent my role\".\n\nWhen it was announced at the start of summer 1979 that Pope John Paul II would visit Ireland at the end of September there was an urgency for priests with available time, language skills and organisational ability. Fr Brady took a leading (if often understated) role in the practical planning of this historic visit. The following year he returned to Rome as Vice-rector (1980–1987) and later rector (1987–1993) of the Pontifical Irish College. In 1990, he introduced Jack Charlton and the national football team to Pope John Paul II. Following his return to his native country, the then Dr Seán Monsignor Brady became parish priest of Castletara (Ballyhaise) in 1993.\n\nOn 13 December 1994, Monsignor Brady was appointed as the Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh by John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 19 February 1995 from Cahal Cardinal Daly, with Archbishop Emanuele Gerada and Bishop Gerard Clifford serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Jesum Christum Cognoscere\", meaning: \"To Know Jesus Christ\" ().\n\nUpon Cardinal Daly's retirement on 1 October 1996, Archbishop Brady automatically became Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland and was formally enthroned as Metropolitan Archbishop on the following 3 November. He presided over Cardinal Daly's funeral services in January 2010.\n\nOn 8 September 2014 it was announced that the Pope had accepted Cardinal Brady's resignation effective that day; Brady was automatically and immediately succeeded by his coadjutor, Archbishop Eamon Martin.\n\nOn 24 November 2007, Archbishop Brady was created Cardinal-Priest of \"Santi Quirico e Giulitta\" as a symbol of the new cardinal's role in helping the pontiff to minister to the diocese of Rome. Following his elevation to the cardinalate, he joined Cahal Cardinal Daly, Desmond Cardinal Connell and Keith Cardinal O'Brien as one of four living Irish cardinals, a record in Irish history. Senior Vatican figures suggested that the archbishop's positive contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process weighed heavily in Pope Benedict's decision to make him a Cardinal.\n\nCardinal Brady, as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, was elected President of the Irish Episcopal Conference.\n\nOn 12 June 2008, Pope Benedict named him a member if the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Pontifical Council for Culture.\n\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.\nHe also served as the Grand Prior of the Lieutenancy of Ireland, of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, a centuries old Order of Chivalry dedicated to supporting the Christians of the Holy Land.\n\nIn April 2010, Cardinal Brady, who was under pressure to resign and had publicly stated he was considering his position over his role in the cover-up of the activities of a paedophile priest, was officiating at a confirmation ceremony in the parish church of Kildress in County Tyrone, when he fell ill. He remained in a conscious state while waiting for an ambulance to arrive at the church. He is known to suffer from a blood pressure condition. He was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital for observation.\n\nOn 4 November 2008, Cardinal Brady criticised the Government's plan allowing for the recognition of cohabiting and same-sex couples, describing the plan in the negative sense as \"\"perhaps the greatest revolution in the history of the Irish family\"\" and that instead the Government were obliged by the Constitution to guard the institution of marriage \"with special care\".\n\nOn 26 October 2009, Cardinal Brady said that further cuts to the Republic of Ireland's overseas development budget would have a devastating impact on the lives of some of the world's poorest people. In a letter to Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan, he said: \"These vulnerable people have had no part to play in creating the multiple crises now facing them – climate, financial, food – yet the challenges they face are unprecedented. I appeal to you not to turn your back on them. We must ensure that we maintain our current level of aid spending until such a time as we are in a position to build it up again.\"\n\nCardinal Brady said in January 2010, that it was \"blatantly unjust\" and \"a complete red herring\" to say that the Catholic Church has no right to be involved in schools that receive State funding, in a strong defence of the role of the church in education. He said that parents had a right to have their children educated in accordance with their philosophical and religious convictions and the State had a duty to support this with public funds. The presumption the Catholic Church wanted to control as many schools as it could, irrespective of parental demands, was increasingly seen to be unfounded, he added.\n\nIn December 2010 Cardinal Brady said a European Court of Human Rights ruling did not oblige the State to introduce legislation authorising abortion. The European court ruled Ireland has failed to properly implement the constitutional right to abortion where a woman is entitled to one where her life is at risk. Cardinal Brady said the judgment \"leaves future policy in Ireland on protecting the lives of unborn children in the hands of the Irish people and does not oblige Ireland to introduce legislation authorising abortion\".\n\nIn November 2011 Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore announced that due to cost-cutting measures, the Irish embassy to the Holy See would close and that the duties of the ambassador would be dealt with by the secretary-general of the department. Cardinal Brady said that the closure \"means that Ireland will be without a resident Ambassador to the Holy See for the first time since diplomatic relations were established and envoys were exchanged between the two states in 1929\". He added that \"This decision seems to show little regard for the important role played by the Holy See in international relations and of the historic ties between the Irish people and the Holy See over many centuries\" and went on to say that \"It is worth recalling that for the new Irish State, the opening of diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1929 was a very significant moment. It was very important in asserting the identity and presence of the Irish Free State internationally in view of the fact that Irish diplomatic representation abroad was then confined to the legation in Washington, the office of the high commissioner in London, the permanent delegate to the League of Nations, and the Embassy to the Holy See\".\n\nThe Cardinal told RTÉ News in an interview, broadcast in December 2009 after the publication of the Murphy Report, that he was confident Bishop Donal Murray of Limerick will \"do the right thing\" in terms of considering his position in the wake of criticism in the Dublin diocesan report. He also said in that interview \"If I found myself in a situation where I was aware that my failure to act had allowed or meant that other children were abused, well then, I think I would resign.\"\n\nThe unprecedented 15–16 February 2010 summit at the Vatican with Pope Benedict and senior members of the Curia was described by the Cardinal as \"one step in a process [...] which will lead to a journey of repentance, renewal and reconciliation\". He said that process \"hopefully, will gain momentum when we get back to Ireland\". At 8:00 am twenty-four of Ireland's diocesan bishops met Pope Benedict and seven leading members of the Curia in the first of three sessions, which continued to 1:00 pm and resume after noon until 8:00 pm The 16 February session began at 8:00 am and ended late that morning. Each Irish bishop spoke for about five minutes.\n\nBrady agreed that there had been \"tensions\" among the bishops over the fallout from the Murphy Report, \"but to describe them as 'divisions' is another matter. Last week at Knock we had a very cordial retreat. Things were thrashed out fully and frankly\", he said. Brady brought up popular sentiment in his country that Papal envoy to Ireland Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza should appear before the Foreign Affairs committee of Dáil Éireann, but was told that by practice a nuncio will not appear before a parliamentary committee.\n\nIn March 2010 it became widely known that the then Father Seán Brady had participated in an internal Church legal process into the actions of Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. The process required all participants to maintain the confidentiality of the tribunal. Smyth went on to abuse dozens of children before being brought to justice in 1994. Taken alongside his statement in December, this led to widespread calls for Cardinal Brady's resignation. The information of this internal process had been publicly available as far back as 10 August 1997 in an article by Declan White in the \"Mirror\".\n\nOne of those who was a child interviewed in the internal process is suing Cardinal Brady on the grounds that complaints about Fr. Smyth were not reported to the Garda, that steps were not taken to prevent Fr. Smyth from committing further assaults, that the children were required to sign oaths not to discuss the complaints and that the failure to report the complaints led to the plaintiff and others not receiving appropriate medical treatment.\n\nThe then Labour Party spokesman on social and family affairs, Róisín Shortall, T.D., said Cardinal Brady was \"hopelessly compromised by what has emerged\". She said, \"There should be a Garda investigation to determine whether or not the failure to report Fr Smyth's crimes to the civil authorities was, itself, a criminal offence.\"\n\nOn 17 March 2010, the deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, called for Brady to resign.\n\nIn May 2010, Cardinal Brady said that he would not resign as archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.\n\nStanding outside Armagh Cathedral, Brady acknowledged there were some who would not agree with his decision but vowed to lead the Church's efforts to improve child protection measures. \"It certainly wasn’t an easy decision\" he said. \"I have listened to a lot of people, reflected as I said I would, I listened to survivors, to priests, to religious people up and down the length of this diocese and I have decided to continue in my present role, to play my part in this diocese. Because I want to maintain the momentum towards better child safeguarding and not alone that, also the momentum towards renewal of the faith, which is essential here and a big challenge.\"\n\nDr Brady said the vast majority of people he had spoken to wanted him to remain in post. \"I was on pilgrimage to Lourdes yesterday with 800 people from this diocese and not one said they had no confidence in me, they said they wanted me to stay and continue this work.\" Cardinal Brady told mass-goers at his Saint Patrick's Day homily in March that he would take a period of time to reflect on his future in the church. He confirmed he would stay on following the announcement yesterday of an all-island audit into how the Church handles abuse allegations. He said he had asked for his own diocese to be inspected by Vatican officials.\n\nIn September 2010 Cardinal Brady asked whether Irish people had lost their capacity for mercy and forgiveness. \"\"Have we become too aggressive and impatient in relation to the weaknesses and failings of others,\"\" he asked. Speaking at a Mass in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon, held to mark the 200th anniversary of St Nathy's College there, he said: \"\"I sometimes wonder if we are in danger of losing our sense of mercy and forgiveness in Ireland today.\"\"\n\nIn May 2012 the BBC television programme \"This World\" found that Dr Seán Cardinal Brady had the names and addresses of children being abused by the paedophile priest Brendan Smyth, but \"did not ensure their safety\".\n\nIn response to a 2010 request Brady made for the appointment of a coadjutor, on 18 January 2013 Pope Benedict named as Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh 51-year-old Eamon Monsignor Martin of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry, where he had been serving as diocesan administrator. As coadjutor, Monsignor Martin was the Cardinal's chief deputy with right of succession as Metropolitan Archbishop of Armagh on the death or retirement of the Cardinal. \n\nIn July 2014 Brady confirmed that he had tendered his resignation, one month before his seventy-fifth birthday. With an alacrity that surprised few, on 8 September 2014, it was announced that Pope Francis had accepted Cardinal Brady's resignation.\n\nOn his 80th birthday, 16 August 2019, he lost the right to vote in future papal conclaves.\n\n\n"}

Eagle Rare is 90 proof bourbon, aged for either 10 or 17 years, depending on variety. It was introduced in 1975, and is distilled in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\nEagle Rare was originally a 101-proof ten-year-old (not single-barrel) Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey from Seagram created by master distiller Charles L. Beam. Introduced in 1975, Eagle Rare was among the last new bourbon brands introduced prior to the current era of 'small-batch bourbons'. Eagle Rare has been distilled, bottled and/or marketed by a number of companies, including the Old Prentice Distillery of Frankfort, KY.\n\nThe Sazerac Company, an American family owned producer and importer based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the parent company of five distilleries, acquired Eagle Rare from Seagram in March 1989. Sazerac's Kentucky distillery was then known as the George T. Stagg Distillery. Today the distillery is known as the Buffalo Trace Distillery.\n\nThe original 101-proof ten-year-old non-single-barrel bourbon has been discontinued as of March 2005.\n\nCurrently, two basic varieties of Eagle Rare are produced. The first is aged for ten years (in charred new oak barrels, as with all bourbons), and bottled at 90 U.S. proof. \n\nThe second variety is aged seventeen years and is called part of an \"Antique Collection\". It is also bottled at 90 proof.\n\nEagle Rare's 10-year variation has performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. It received a string of gold and double gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2005 and 2010 and was given an above-average score of 92 by the Beverage Testing Institute. In 2013, Eagle Rare Single Barrel Bourbon was awarded the inaugural Bourbon Trophy at the International Wine & Spirits Competition in the United Kingdom. The 17-year expression has performed similarly well. More recently, Eagle Rare Single Barrel Bourbon won a Gold medal at the 2014 Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition and a Gold Outstanding medal at the International Wine & Spirits Competition (IWSC – United Kingdom). Eagle Rare 17 Year Old was awarded a Gold medal in the same UK-based competition. In 2015, Eagle Rare 10 Year was awarded a Gold Outstanding medal by the IWSC, and the 2014 release of the 17 Year Old expression won a Silver Outstanding medal in the same competition.\n\nEagle Rare 10 Year won the following awards in 2016:\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy rated the brand highly, saying \"Without question, the award-winner tastes as rich as it looks.\"\n\n"}

Known as Glebe Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Crystal City north to SR 123 at the Chain Bridge. SR 120 is a partial circumferential highway in Arlington County that connects the southeastern and northwestern corners of the county with several urban villages along its crescent-shaped path, including Ballston. The state highway also connects all of the major highways that radiate from Washington, including Interstate 395, I-66, US 50, and US 29. SR 120 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length.\n\nSR 120 begins at an intersection with US 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) at the south end of Crystal City, just north of the city of Alexandria––though Glebe Road actually continues three blocks east of US 1 where it ends at Potomac Avenue. The state highway heads west as a four-lane divided highway through the Arlington County sewage treatment facility. West of the facility, SR 120 parallels the Four Mile Run Trail and Four Mile Run, both to the south, and passes to the south of the Arlington Ridge community. At the point the old alignment of SR 120, also named Glebe Road, crosses Four Mile Run into Alexandria, the state highway veers northwest away from the stream and meets I-395 (Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange north of Shirlington. North of the freeway, SR 120 passes between the historic Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and Army Navy Country Club. North of its oblique intersection with Walter Reed Drive, the state highway passes through the commercial center of Westmont, where the highway intersects SR 244 (Columbia Pike). North of Westmont, SR 120 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 50 (Arlington Boulevard) adjacent to the Cathedral of Saint Thomas More.\nSR 120 continues north onto Ballston, where the highway expands to six lanes at Quincy Street. The state highway passes by Ballston Quarter and the adjacent MedStar Capitals Iceplex, practice rink of the Washington Capitals. SR 120 veers north at Wilson Boulevard and passes by the Arlington Center of Northern Virginia Community College at Fairfax Drive, which heads east as SR 237 toward Clarendon and west as ramps to and from I-66 toward Falls Church. The state highway runs concurrently with SR 237 for two blocks north to Washington Boulevard, onto which SR 237 heads west toward Falls Church. Just north of Washington Boulevard, SR 120 has a partial interchange with I-66 that allows access to and from the direction of Washington and where the highway crosses the Custis Trail.\n\nSR 120 leaves Ballston as a four-lane divided highway that passes by The Glebe House and intersects US 29 (Lee Highway). The state highway has an oblique intersection with SR 309 (Old Dominion Drive) on an overpass of Yorktown Boulevard adjacent to Marymount University. At Williamsburg Boulevard, SR 120 veers northeast to parallel the Arlington–Fairfax county line. At the top of its descent to the Potomac River, the state highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Military Road, a residential street, and reduces to two lanes. The highway has a sweeping curve to the north and passes below the George Washington Memorial Parkway immediately before its northern terminus at SR 123 (Chain Bridge Road), which connects SR 120 with the Parkway. The road continues straight as SR 123 to the Chain Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River just below Little Falls to an intersection with Canal Road and the Clara Barton Parkway in Washington a short distance east of the District of Columbia–Maryland boundary.\n\nA road along the present path of SR 120 has existed at least since the 1750s. This road, linking Alexandria to Great Falls, was first known as the \"Road to the Falls.\" It took its present name from the nearby glebe lands that were used to support the clergy of the colonial Fairfax Parish of the Church of England; those lands also gave their name to the historic Glebe House, which was built in the 19th century on the former glebe property and sits near what is now SR 120. \n\nSR 120 appeared in its current form in the 1940 renumbering, replacing a small part of SR 9, which itself had replaced the original designation of SR 25 in the 1933 renumbering. The majority of SR 25 became SR 123 in 1940.\n\nAnother SR 120 was designated in Franklin County in the 1933 renumbering, which consisted of two sections. One was the present-day SR 739 from its intersection with the present-day US 220 at Boones Mill westward for . The other was the present-day SR 602 from its intersection with SR 40 near Ferrum northward for .\n\nGlebe Road intersects through several areas that have seen an increase in pedestrian traffic since the 1970s. Arlington County and local citizens started discussions on improving pedestrian safety in 2003; the implementation of these started in 2013 and is scheduled to complete in 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "1980547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980547", "title": "First Doctor", "text": "First Doctor\n\nThe First Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor and the original protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He was portrayed by actor William Hartnell.\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change.\n\nHartnell's Doctor is the initial form of the Doctor portrayed in the series. The concept of regeneration, initially referred to as a \"renewal,\" was introduced when Hartnell needed to leave the series, and consequently has extended the life of the show for many years. \n\nHis original companions were his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford) and her schoolteachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill). In later episodes, he travelled alongside 25th century orphan Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), space pilot Steven (Peter Purves), Trojan handmaiden Katarina (Adrienne Hill), and sixties flower child Dodo Chaplet (Jackie Lane). His final on-screen companions were the sailor Ben (Michael Craze) and the posh and sophisticated Polly (Anneke Wills).\n\nHartnell reprised the role once, in the tenth anniversary story \"The Three Doctors\" (1973). The character occasionally appeared in the series after Hartnell's death, most prominently in 1983's \"The Five Doctors\" where he was portrayed by Richard Hurndall, and two episodes in 2017, \"The Doctor Falls\" and the Christmas special, \"Twice Upon a Time\", portrayed by David Bradley.\n\nThe Doctor is a mysterious character and little is known about him except that he has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman, and that they come from another time and place. He has a ship that travels through time and space, the TARDIS, which is currently disguised as a police box (Susan notes that it used to be able to change to blend in with its surroundings), and is bigger on the inside. The Doctor describes himself and Susan as \"exiles\" without specifying why or even whether their exile is self-imposed. It would not be until the last adventure of the Doctor's second incarnation that the name of the Doctor's people (the Time Lords) would be revealed, and the third incarnation before the name of his home planet (Gallifrey) was first spoken.\n\nThe series' first episode opens with a pair of schoolteachers in contemporary (1963) London, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, investigating the mystery of Susan, a student who seems confused and even frustrated at how what she is learning in history and especially mathematics seems to be wrong. Following Susan to her supposed home, they discover the TARDIS in a junkyard, surprising both Susan and her grandfather the Doctor, who launches the ship in response to the discovery. Ian and Barbara are involuntarily taken on a journey back to the year 100,000 BC and spend two years adventuring through time and space with the Doctor, who at this point in the series has no control over the navigation systems of the TARDIS.\n\nIt was as this incarnation that the Doctor first met the Daleks and the Cybermen, races that would become his most implacable foes. The TARDIS crew also observed many historical events such as the \"Reign of Terror\" in revolutionary France, meeting \"Marco Polo\" in China and \"The Aztecs\" in Mexico. When Susan fell in love with the human resistance fighter David Campbell, the Doctor left her behind to allow her to build a life for herself on 22nd century Earth (\"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\"), although he promised to return some day. The Doctor, Ian and Barbara were then joined by Vicki, whom they saved in \"The Rescue\" from the planet Dido.\n\nAt the conclusion of a chase through time by Daleks, Ian and Barbara used the Dalek time machine to go home (\"The Chase\"), and their place in the TARDIS was taken by a future space pilot named Steven Taylor, who had been captured by the robot Mechanoids but escaped due to the Dalek attack. The Doctor met another member of his own race for the first time in the form of the Meddling Monk and had an adventure in Galaxy 4. During the siege of Troy, Vicki decided to leave the TARDIS to stay with Troilus, adopting the name Cressida. The Doctor and Steven were next briefly joined by Trojan slave Katarina and a security agent from 4000 AD Sara Kingdom, but both were killed during the events of \"The Daleks' Master Plan\", where the Daleks plotted to invade Earth's Solar System in 4000 AD, before being destroyed when the Doctor activated their weapon the Time Destructor. Due to this he was aged significantly; the effects on Sara were enough to reduce her to dust.\n\nAfter narrowly missing the Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, the Doctor and Steven took on board a young girl named Dodo Chaplet. Dodo brought a cold virus to the far future, which nearly annihilated the humans and Monoids travelling on \"The Ark\". It was cured and when the TARDIS arrived on the Ark 700 years later the TARDIS crew helped the humans reach their destination, the Monoids having taken over the Ark. One of the First Doctor's most deadly foes was the Celestial Toymaker, who forced him and his companions to play deadly games and briefly made the Doctor invisible and mute. Eventually, the Doctor managed to win the Trilogic Game allowing them all to escape the Toymaker's domain.\n\nEventually, Steven and Dodo left the Doctor as well, Steven remaining on an alien planet as a mediator (\"The Savages\") between two races, and Dodo deciding to remain on Earth in 1966 to recover from being hypnotised by the supercomputer WOTAN. The Doctor was then joined by upper-class secretary Polly and sailor Ben Jackson.\n\nThe toll of years put strain on the Doctor's elderly frame. After defeating the Cybermen at the Antarctic Snowcap Station (\"The Tenth Planet\"), the Doctor was fearfully reluctant to regenerate when he crossed paths with one of his future incarnations (\"Twice Upon a Time\"), who is similarly reluctant to regenerate. The events of the episode convince both Doctors to go through with their regenerations. After returning to his TARDIS and helping Polly and Ben back inside, the Doctor collapsed and regenerated for the first time.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Doctor was a mysterious figure. He appeared to be a frail old man and yet was possessed of unexpected reserves of strength and will. An early writers' guide by script editor David Whitaker describes \"Doctor Who\" as \"frail-looking but wiry and tough as an old turkey\". He obviously held tremendous knowledge of scientific matters, and yet was unable to pilot his TARDIS time ship reliably; his granddaughter Susan explained this by saying that her grandfather was \"a bit forgetful\"; but the TARDIS required expert piloting and guidance by the Doctor. Its systems would often break down, especially the navigational systems. This, combined with the fact the TARDIS was actually designed for \"six\" pilots, would explain the difficulty the Doctor encountered in piloting it correctly. He was abrasive, patronising, and cantankerous towards his human travelling companions, yet shared a deep emotional bond with his granddaughter Susan. He also harboured a streak of ruthlessness, being willing to lie—and in one case attempt to kill—to achieve his goals. Initially, he distrusted his first two human companions, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who were forced on him. Over time, however, as they shared adventures together, he grew closer to them, and the TARDIS crew came to share almost a family bond. When proven wrong after accusing Ian and Barbara of sabotaging the TARDIS in \"The Edge of Destruction\", the Doctor humbly apologised, especially after seeing that Barbara had been hurt by his accusations. The Doctor realised he could rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS, with the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara being mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate.\n\nEventually, the Doctor began to enjoy his travels through time and space, taking people along for the ride and was always reluctant and sad to see them go, even when he knew it was for their own good. The Doctor's personality mellowed around the time of the serial \"Marco Polo\", and he evolved into the more familiar grandfatherly figure that children loved. The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure. He was protective of the young women he took on as companions; they reminded him of his granddaughter, Susan. \n\nWilliam Hartnell described the Doctor as \"a wizard\", and \"a cross between the Wizard of Oz and Father Christmas\". Paul McGann, who played a later incarnation of the Doctor, said Hartnell's \"seemed like a Victorian, someone kind of stern and paterfamilias about him. Something kind but scary\". One quirk of the First Doctor was his tendency to become occasionally tongue-tied and stumble over words. Sometimes this was a deliberate acting choice: William Russell recalls that it was Hartnell's idea for the Doctor to get Ian Chesterton's surname wrong, calling him \"Chesserman\", \"Chatterton\" and even \"Charterhouse\". This character choice also gave the series' producers the ability to use takes in which Hartnell flubbed his lines. Due to the series' tight production schedule, it was rarely possible to reshoot such scenes and dubbing the dialogue was usually not an option. Hartnell suffered from undiagnosed arteriosclerosis, which affected his ability to remember lines, increasingly so as his time on the series progressed.\n\nIn \"Twice Upon a Time\", the Doctor expressed to a variation of his future companion Bill Potts that he had left Gallifrey, among other reasons, to investigate why good prevails in a universe where evil would seem to have so many advantages. As Bill reflected that none of the First Doctor's future incarnations recognized this fact, the Twelfth Doctor summarized that he and his incarnations were the reason for the universe's balance between good and evil.\n\nHartnell's costume was hired from Nathans, a theatrical costuming company. The overall look is Victorian-Edwardian: a black frock coat and a light yellow tweed waistcoat over a wing-collared shirt; usually a dark blue ascot tie or ribbon tie and tartan trousers. Hartnell also wore a ring with a large blue stone and a white wig. Additional accessories seen from time to time are a monocle, a carved wooden cane, an opera cape, a scarf, and a hat in Astrakhan fur. In \"An Unearthly Child\", he was seen smoking a large bent tobacco pipe, making him the only incarnation of the Doctor to be seen smoking; it is assumed that he gave up after that serial.\n\nIn the original version of the first episode, Hartnell wore a contemporary (1960s) suit. Among the many changes made to the episode in reshooting was the Doctor's (and Susan's) clothes.\n\nThe debut of the Daleks in the second serial turned the programme from a children's series to a national phenomenon. It soon became a show that the whole family gathered to watch, with monsters that children viewed from between their fingers or from behind the sofa. Scripts filled with far-out concepts compensated for the relatively low budget and unsophisticated special effects, laying the foundation for decades of stories to come.\n\nDespite the regeneration television audiences would see the First Doctor on screen for several more occasions (not counting flashbacks or charity specials like \"Dimensions in Time\"). For the 10th anniversary of the programme in 1973, Hartnell appeared in \"The Three Doctors\", which also saw Patrick Troughton reprise his role as the Second Doctor. Due to failing health, however, Hartnell could not participate in any of the regular filming, so his scenes were shot separately at Ealing Studios (not his garden or garage at home, as long suggested by fan legend); in the context of the episode, this is explained as the First Doctor being trapped in a time eddy when he was being sent to assist his future selves, with the result that he can only communicate with his future selves for brief moments over the TARDIS monitor while sitting in a capsule.\n\nWilliam Hartnell died on 23 April 1975, so for the 20th anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\" in 1983, the role of the First Doctor was played by Richard Hurndall. At the beginning of the programme a film insert of Hartnell's Doctor taken from \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\" was used.\n\nIn \"The Name of the Doctor\", which combined stock footage of Hartnell with Carole Ann Ford in CGI and newly shot footage, the First Doctor is depicted stealing the TARDIS in its original form.\n\nIn \"The Day of the Doctor\", Hartnell is shown along with the other twelve doctors as they move Gallifrey to a single moment in time. He was voiced by John Guilor, over archival footage of Hartnell.\n\nA child version of the character appears in \"Listen\" (2014), portrayed by an uncredited Michael Jones.\n\nIn the Big Finish audio drama \"The Light at the End\" the First Doctor is portrayed by William Russell, who also played Ian Chesterton in both the show and the audio dramas. Russell and fellow co-star Peter Purves (who played Steven Taylor) have performed numerous other audio plays set during this era, usually narrating the stories and doing an impression (rather than an impersonation) of the Doctor's voice while reciting his lines.\nIn the series 10 finale \"The Doctor Falls\", David Bradley appeared as the First Doctor, confronting his twelfth incarnation as the latter resists his oncoming regeneration. This scene was followed up in the 2017 Christmas special, \"Twice Upon a Time\". Bradley had previously portrayed William Hartnell in \"An Adventure in Space and Time\", a 2013 docudrama depicting the creation of \"Doctor Who\". He reprised the role of the First Doctor for a series of audio stories released by Big Finish, titled \"\", starting in January 2018; in \"The Destination Wars\", the Doctor encounters an early incarnation of the Master who has created a state of war on the planet Destination to provoke a level of technological development that will allow him to repair his damaged TARDIS, and in \"The Great White Hurricane\" the TARDIS crew are separated when they arrive in New York just before the Great Blizzard of 1888. \"The Invention of Death\" brings the crew to a planet of giant single-celled organisms where they inadvertently introduce the concept of procreation and death to the culture, and \"The Barbarian and the Samurai\" traps the crew in political conflict in mid-nineteenth-century Japan. \"The Phoenicians\" sees the TARDIS arrive in ancient Tyre and become caught up in the political strife of the time, and \"Tick-Tock World\" sees the TARDIS crash-land on a planet caught in a complex temporal anomaly, only escaping with the aid of a future version of Susan from a timeline where she remained trapped on that planet for centuries, with the future Susan's actions erasing the TARDIS's original arrival on the planet.\n\nImages of the First Doctor appear in \"The Power of the Daleks\", \"Day of the Daleks\", \"The Brain of Morbius\", \"Earthshock\", \"Mawdryn Undead\", \"Resurrection of the Daleks\", \"The Next Doctor\", \"The Eleventh Hour\", \"The Vampires of Venice\", \"Vincent and the Doctor\", \"The Lodger\", \"Nightmare in Silver\" and \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"Death of the Doctor\". In the episode \"The Name of the Doctor\", he is seen stealing a TARDIS along with Susan Foreman, before Clara Oswald tells him to steal a different one (colourised footage taken from \"The Aztecs\"). He is also seen for a brief second wandering around the Doctor's mind in the end of \"The Name of the Doctor,\" although this time a double was used. He also makes a brief appearance (again using a double) during Missy's exposition of the Twelfth Doctor's battle with android assassins (\"The Witch's Familiar\").\n\nIn \"Dimensions in Time\" the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) refers to the First as \"the grumpy one\". A sculpture of his head, along with that of the Second Doctor, appears as well.\n\nThe First Doctor is seen as a sketch in John Smith's book alongside other past Doctors in the episode \"Human Nature\". In \"Time Crash\", the Tenth Doctor says to the Fifth, \"Back when I first started, at the very beginning, I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important, like you do when you're young.\" A brief clip of the First Doctor from \"The Time Meddler\" appears in both \"The Next Doctor\" and in \"The Eleventh Hour\".\n\nIn a clip from \"The Vampires of Venice\" the Eleventh Doctor shows his library card, which contains a photograph of the First Doctor and the address of 76 Totters Lane. In \"Vincent and the Doctor\", both the First and Second Doctors appear on a printout when the Eleventh Doctor has the TARDIS identify him. In \"The Big Bang\", the Eleventh Doctor briefly mentions the First while bidding his farewell to a sleeping Amy Pond, referring to him as \"the daft old man who stole a magic box and ran away\". In \"The Rings of Akhaten\", the Eleventh Doctor mentions that he had visited Akhaten with his granddaughter, presumably as the First Doctor.\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor refers to his first incarnation's initial lack of altruism prior to meeting the Daleks in \"Into the Dalek\".\n\nA portrait of the First Doctor is hanging in a UNIT safe house in \"The Zygon Invasion\".\n\n"}

Coolhunting firms often provide services for some of the largest corporations in the world.\n\nRather than outsourcing their market research, some companies opt for in-house youth culture marketing divisions. These divisions act in much the same way as a coolhunting firm but the reports and data collected remain within the company and are used solely to promote its products. A company will often prefer this form of coolhunting as a way to gain an advantage in the valuable youth market since the research conducted by coolhunting firms is available to anyone willing to pay for it. Viacom's MTV television network employs in-house coolhunting.\n\nCoolhunting is more than simple market research because of the nature of the subjects. The teen and preteen market is often referred to as a \"stubborn\" demographic in that they do not respond as well to blatant advertising and marketing campaigns targeted at them. Coolhunters therefore must be more stealthy in their methods of gathering information and data.\n\nFocus groups, though quite obvious in their attempts at gathering information, are very popular among coolhunters as they provide direct insight into the thoughts and feelings of their target demographic. Coolhunters will typically gather a group of randomly selected individuals from their target demographic. While one or more market researchers interact with the group, they are often being monitored and recorded by a non-visible group, because not only do coolhunters want to \"hear\" what their subjects have to say, they also want to \"observe\" their simple mannerisms.\n\nDepending on the nature of the study, the methods of the information-gathering during a focus group interview may be extremely broad, with questions relating to lifestyle and youth culture, or more specific, like comparing certain brands and determining which brands the group is most responsive to.\n\nParticipants in focus groups are usually rewarded for their participation, whether it be a cash amount, free products, or other rewards.\n\nCoolhunters will often seek out individuals from within their target demographic who are regarded as leaders or trendsetters. They will then hire these individuals to be \"Cool Narcs\", who gather information secretly among their peers and report their findings back to their employers. This is a popular method of coolhunting as it provides insight into their target demographic within their natural environment.\n\nThere are a wide variety of methods for conducting market research online. Popular examples are online surveys where upon completion, the participant will usually receive a prize or monetary compensation. Other times coolhunters will enter chatrooms and webgroups posing as an individual within the target demographic and gather information.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1980551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980551", "title": "Second Doctor", "text": "Second Doctor\n\nThe Second Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He was portrayed by character actor Patrick Troughton.\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change.\n\nThe transformation into the Second Doctor (originally referred to as a \"renewal\"), a figure who was the same 'essential' character as the first but with a very different persona, was a turning point in the evolution of the series, and eventually became a critical element of the series' longevity.\n\nThe First Doctor grew progressively weaker while battling the Cybermen during the events of \"The Tenth Planet\" (1966) and eventually collapsed, seemingly from old age. His body renewed itself and transformed into the Second Doctor.\n\nInitially, the relationship between the Second Doctor and his predecessor was unclear. In his first story, the Second Doctor referred to his predecessor in the third person as if he were a completely different person. His companions Ben and Polly are at first unsure how to treat him and it is only when a Dalek recognises him that they accept that he is the Doctor.\n\nIn the second story, \"The Highlanders\" (1966–67), Jamie McCrimmon joined the TARDIS crew, and remained with the Second Doctor for the rest of his travels. Ben and Polly left together when the TARDIS landed at Gatwick Airport on the same day they originally left with the First Doctor, after they had stopped the mass kidnapping of tourists by shape shifting aliens. The Doctor and Jamie then became involved in a plot by the Daleks to gain both the \"Human and Dalek Factors\" when the TARDIS was stolen, which led to them meeting Victoria Waterfield in the 19th century. The Doctor used the situation to engineer a Dalek civil war that seemingly destroyed the Daleks forever. However, Victoria's father was among the casualties. Now an orphan, Victoria chose to accompany the Doctor and Jamie on their travels. Although she felt great affection for the Doctor and Jamie, she was never able to completely come to terms with life in the TARDIS and the constant danger that resulted. She eventually chose to leave after the events of \"Fury from the Deep\" (1968) and was adopted by someone in the 20th Century. The Doctor was then joined by Zoe Heriot, an extremely intelligent woman from the 21st century, who helped defeat the Cybermen attack on a space station known as the Wheel. She then stowed away in the TARDIS and, despite the Doctor's warnings about what she might encounter, chose to remain.\n\nDuring his second incarnation, the Doctor confronted familiar foes such as the Daleks and the Cybermen, as well as new enemies such as the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors. It was during this time that he first met Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, in the tunnels of the London Underground. Following the defeat of the Great Intelligence, Lethbridge-Stewart was promoted to Brigadier and became the leader of the British contingent of UNIT, a military organisation tasked to investigate and defend the world from extraterrestrial threats. The Doctor reteamed with him to defeat an invasion of Cybermen in league with industrialist Tobias Vaughan.\n\nThe Second Doctor's time came to an end when the TARDIS landed in the middle of a warzone, created by a race of alien warlords who, with the help of another renegade Time Lord the War Chief, progressively kidnapped and brainwashed humans into becoming soldiers for them, hoping to use the ones who survived to conquer the Galaxy. Although the Doctor was able to defeat their plan, he realised he would be unable to return the human subjects to their various original points in Earth's history. He therefore contacted the Time Lords, sacrificing his own freedom in the process, and despite an attempt to escape was forced to return to his home planet. He was then put on trial by the Time Lords, for breaking their laws of non-interference. Despite the Doctor's argument that the Time Lords should use their great powers to help others, he was sentenced to exile on 20th century Earth, the Time Lords forcing his regeneration into the Third Doctor in the process. Jamie and Zoe were returned to their own time, with their memories of all but their first encounter with the Doctor wiped and the secret of the TARDIS was also taken from the Doctor.\n\nDue to what would appear to be continuity errors in Troughton's later appearances (particularly in \"The Two Doctors\"), some fans have speculated that the Time Lords used the Second Doctor as an agent after the events of \"The War Games\" (1969), and that he did not in fact immediately regenerate and enter his exile on Earth. This theory of continuity is described as \"Season 6B\". Additionally, while \"The War Games\" never depicted the Doctor's regeneration itself, it was later depicted in \"TV Comic\", which treated the exiled Doctor's exploits on Earth, before, in a comic entitled \"The Nightwalkers\", showing the Doctor dragged in to the TARDIS by animated scarecrows, allowing his change of appearance to take place. The Second Doctor's regeneration was also depicted in \"Devious\", a fan-produced film starring Jon Pertwee in his last appearance as the Third Doctor.\n\nAccording to script editor Robert Holmes, the Second Doctor's missions for the Time Lords took place prior to the events of \"The War Games\": \"they 'framed' the Troughton Doctor and got him to do various things for them, and then hauled him up in front of them on trial – like the Americans persecuting McCarthy\".\n\nThe Second Doctor has been nicknamed the \"Cosmic Hobo\", as the impish Second Doctor appeared to be far more scruffy and childlike than his first incarnation.\n\nMercurial, clever, and always a few steps ahead of his enemies, at times he could be a calculating schemer who would not only manipulate people for the greater good but act like a bumbling fool to have others underestimate his true abilities. One example is in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" (1967), where, despite his admonitions not to open the titular tomb, he corrects evil logician Eric Klieg's calculations of the code to open the tomb behind Klieg's back. This allows the tomb to be opened, so that the Doctor can expose Klieg and the Cybermens' respective plans and defeat both. \n\nSometimes his manipulation of those around him can veer into dark territory. In \"The Evil of the Daleks\" (1967), he coldly manipulates Jamie into trying to rescue Victoria (thus setting in motion the Human Factor tests) and is unsympathetic when Edward Waterfield tries to apologise for his collaboration with the Daleks. Later in the story he appears to have been converted by the \"Dalek factor\" into a mental Dalek, although he eventually reveals this to be a pretence. In \"The Enemy of the World\" (1968) while impersonating villain Salamander who is his doppelganger, he interrogates Jamie and Victoria without their knowing that it is really himself, provoking them until they nearly physically attack him. In the following story \"The Web of Fear\" he apparently reconciles to the Great Intelligence's plan to drain his mind and resists rescue attempts - only afterwards does it emerge that he planned to reverse to mind-drain. Despite the bluster and tendency to panic when events got out of control, the Second Doctor always acted heroically and morally in his desire to help the oppressed.\n\nThis Doctor is associated with the catchphrases \"When I say run, \"run\"!\", and \"Oh my giddy aunt!\" (although the latter is only first heard in one of his last few stories, \"The Krotons\") and is noted for playing the recorder.\n\nTroughton's costume was the result from discussion between the actor himself, producer Innes Lloyd, and script-editor Gerry Davis. He wore a black frock coat, several sizes too big, over a light-coloured shirt and very baggy trousers, which, like his bow-tie, were fixed with a safety pin. In his first two stories, the trousers were orange and black two-inch check. He also tended to wear a stovepipe hat and pixie boots. The actor denied suggestions that his distinctive mop of jet black hair was a wig.\n\nIn stories set in colder environments, Troughton wore a cloak (\"The Highlanders\", \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\") or a short fur coat (\"The Abominable Snowmen\", \"The Five Doctors\").\n\nWith the arrival of a younger Doctor and changing tastes, the Second Doctor's tenure was characterised by a faster pace and a preference toward \"monster of the week\"-style horror stories, whilst the purely historical adventures that were a recurring feature of the Hartnell era ceased with \"The Highlanders\", the only Troughton-era entry in that genre. While Troughton's Doctor would still visit the Earth's past, he would always encounter an alien, such as the Daleks or the Ice Warriors. It was also during this era that \"Doctor Who\" began to come under fire for its purportedly violent and frightening content.\n\nAs with his predecessor, all the Second Doctor's original episodes were in black-and-white. Later guest appearances in \"The Three Doctors\" (1972–73), \"The Five Doctors\" (1983) and \"The Two Doctors\" (1985) were in colour. However, Troughton's reign as the Doctor was more notable for what does \"not\" exist than for what does, as many of the episodes featuring the Second Doctor were junked by the BBC; a full list of incomplete Doctor Who serials shows how many of these episodes are missing from the BBC Archives.\n\nOnly two stories in Troughton's first two seasons – \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" (1967) and \"The Enemy of the World\" (1968) – still exist in their entirety; ten stories only exist partially (most with one or two episodes out of 4 or 6); and four are lost in their entirety: his first story, \"The Power of the Daleks\" (1966); Jamie's first adventure, \"The Highlanders\"; \"The Macra Terror\" (1967); and Victoria's last adventure, \"Fury From the Deep\".\n\nThe Second Doctor would return to the series on three occasions: in 1973 for the 10th anniversary serial \"The Three Doctors\" (which also saw the return of William Hartnell as the First Doctor), in 1983 for the 20th anniversary special, \"The Five Doctors\", and once more in 1985 in \"The Two Doctors\".\n\nImages of the Second Doctor appear in \"Day of the Daleks\" (1972), \"The Brain of Morbius\" (1976), \"Earthshock\" (1982), \"Mawdryn Undead\" (1983), \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" (1984), \"Human Nature\" (2007), \"The Next Doctor\" (2008), \"The Eleventh Hour\" (2010), \"Vincent and the Doctor\" (2010), \"The Lodger\" (2010), \"Nightmare in Silver\" (2013), and \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"Death of the Doctor\" (2010), and \"The Husbands of River Song\" (2015).\n\nA sculpture of his head, along with that of the First Doctor, appears in the 1993 special for \"Children in Need\" titled \"Dimensions in Time\" (1993). The Fourth Doctor calls him \"the flautist.\"\n\nHe briefly appears in \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), where archive footage from \"The Five Doctors\" is used to show him running past Clara Oswald in an unseen adventure.\n\nThe Second Doctor appears, via archival images, in the series' 50th anniversary special, \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013). He is seen piloting the TARDIS and acting in unison with twelve other incarnations of the Doctor to save Gallifrey on the final day of the Time War.\n\nTroughton received a mixed reception from viewers at first; letters sent to Radio Times both praised \"the superb character he has created\" and complained that \"a wonderful series\" had been turned into \"what looked like Coco the Clown.\"\n\nPeter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Matt Smith, who played the Fifth Doctor, Sixth Doctor, Seventh Doctor and Eleventh Doctor respectively, have stated that the Second Doctor is their favourite. Smith has also stated that his Doctor costume, in particular the bow-tie, was also influenced by the Second Doctor's, after Smith cited the Troughton story \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" as a favourite story.\n\n"}

{"id": "1980559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980559", "title": "Fifth Doctor", "text": "Fifth Doctor\n\nThe Fifth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He is portrayed by Peter Davison.\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change. Davison portrays the fifth such incarnation, who has a vulnerable side and a tendency towards indecisiveness, dressed as a boyish Edwardian cricketer. He travelled with a host of companions, including boy genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), alien aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton) and Australian flight attendant Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), whom he had travelled alongside in his previous incarnation. He also shared later adventures alongside devious schoolboy Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) and American college student Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant).\n\nAfter Tom Baker, the Fourth Doctor, and the BBC had announced that he was leaving the role, the show's producers decided that the next Doctor was to be played by someone who presented something of a physical contrast to Baker and by an actor who was already firmly established in the British public's mind. Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series \"All Creatures Great and Small\" which had \"Doctor Who\" producer John Nathan-Turner as line producer.\n\nThe Fifth Doctor's era was notable for a \"back to the basics\" attitude, in which \"silly\" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John Nathan-Turner. It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric. It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord's enemies, such as the Master, Cybermen, Omega, the Black and White Guardians, and the Silurians.\n\nThe Fourth Doctor was seriously injured after falling off the Pharos Project Radio Telescope so he merged with a future incarnation of himself called the Watcher and regenerated into his new youthful fifth incarnation. The regeneration was difficult, and nearly failed, with the Doctor briefly taking on personality aspects from his four previous incarnations. After recovering in the fictional city Castrovalva (actually an elaborate trap created by his arch-enemy the Master), he continued his travels with Adric, Tegan Jovanka and Nyssa. Initially his travels centred on getting Tegan back to Heathrow Airport in time for her first day as an airhostess, but the TARDIS repeatedly missed this destination and Tegan eventually decided to stay in the TARDIS. After trips to the future and the past encountering villains such as Monarch and the Mara, the Fifth Doctor was confronted with tragedy when Adric died trying to stop a space freighter from crashing into prehistoric Earth (\"Earthshock\").\n\nFollowing Adric's death, the TARDIS accidentally arrived at Heathrow airport (\"Time-Flight\"). Here the Doctor and Nyssa left Tegan assuming she would want to stay (when in fact she did not any more). The Doctor and Nyssa then travelled together for an unspecified amount of time before the renegade Time Lord Omega, attempting to return to our universe, temporally bonded himself to the Doctor (\"Arc of Infinity\"). Faced with this threat, the Time Lords were forced to attempt executing the Doctor, but he eventually tracked Omega to Amsterdam where he defeated him and re-encountered Tegan (who having now lost her job, had no second thoughts about rejoining the TARDIS crew).\n\nWhen the Doctor met a new companion, an alien boy stranded on Earth by the name of Vislor Turlough, he did not know that Turlough had been commissioned by the Black Guardian to kill him. Soon after, Nyssa left to help cure Lazar's Disease on the space station Terminus. After meeting the entities known as Eternals racing in yacht-like spacecraft for the prize of \"Enlightenment\", Turlough broke free from the Black Guardian's influence, and continued to travel with the Doctor and Tegan. Landing in the reign of King John, the crew again encountered the Master, who was using a shape-shifting robot Kamelion to impersonate the King. However, the Doctor helped Kamelion to regain his free will and the robot joined him in his travels (although he rarely left the TARDIS). The Doctor met three of his previous incarnations when they were summoned to the Death Zone on Gallifrey by president Borusa, who was attempting to gain Rassilon's secret of immortality.\n\nAfter further adventures in which the Doctor re-encountered old foes, including the Silurians and the Sea Devils, both Tegan and Turlough left the TARDIS. Tegan would find the death and violence they encountered on their travels too much to bear (\"Resurrection of the Daleks\"), and Turlough returned to his home planet of Trion in the company of his younger brother, as well as other exiles of Trion, from the planet Sarn. The Doctor was eventually forced to destroy Kamelion, when the Master used his mental connection to the robot to regain control of him, a process the robot realised was irreversible (\"Planet of Fire\").\n\nUltimately, the Fifth Doctor and his last companion Peri Brown were exposed to the drug spectrox in its deadly toxic raw form on Androzani Minor. With only one dose of the antidote available, he nobly sacrificed his own existence to save Peri, expressing doubt for the first time that regeneration might be possible this time, then regenerating into the Sixth Doctor.\nA sketch of the Fifth Doctor is seen in John Smith's book in the new series episode \"Human Nature\" (2007). Visions of the Fifth Doctor (alongside other past Doctors) appear in \"The Next Doctor\" (2008) and \"The Eleventh Hour\" (2010). \n\nSomewhere in his life he crashed his TARDIS into the TARDIS of the Tenth Doctor and consequently nearly opened a \"Belgium sized\" black hole because of the paradox caused, which the Tenth Doctor also uses to explain the notably aged appearance of his former self. However the Tenth Doctor, remembering the event, knew how to stop it because he recalled watching himself correct the mistake when he was the Fifth Doctor. (\"Time Crash\")\n\nWhen entering the Doctor's time stream in \"The Name of the Doctor\", Clara Oswald saves the Fifth Doctor (who doesn't notice her) from the Great Intelligence (having entered his time stream prior to her). \n\nAt another unknown point in his life, the Fifth Doctor piloted his TARDIS along with the rest of his first 13 incarnations to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time and save it from the extinction-level aftermath of the Time War (\"The Day of the Doctor)\"\n\nThe Fifth Doctor's chosen mode of dress was a variation of an Edwardian cricketer's kit, and he was even seen to carry a cricket ball in one of his pockets (which saved his life in one adventure). He wore a cream-coloured frock coat, striped trousers, plimsoll shoes, and occasionally a pair of spectacles. He frequently wore an optimo-style Panama hat that had a red band with a black and white pattern, which he would roll up and place in an inside coat pocket. The Tenth Doctor, who inherited various traits from this incarnation such as spectacle use, revealed in \"Time Crash\" that the spectacles were not actually needed to aid the Doctor's eyesight but were just for show to make him look clever (perhaps to counter his youthful appearance), although in \"Four to Doomsday\", he makes a remark about being a bit short-sighted in one eye when questioned about the contents of his pockets, which included the aforementioned cricket ball, a book (The TARDIS Manual) and a magnifying glass. The Fifth Doctor's costume also retained red question marks embroidered onto the collar, which producer John Nathan-Turner added to the Fourth Doctor's costume in 1980. The Fifth Doctor displayed an unusually acute sense of taste in \"Planet of Fire\", also inherited by the Tenth Doctor and the Eleventh Doctor.\n\nOn his left lapel, this Doctor wore a celery stalk. He claimed in \"The Caves of Androzani\" that the celery would turn purple in the presence of certain gases in the \"Praxis\" range to which he was allergic, although this allergy was not mentioned by any incarnations before or since. He said that if that happened, he would then eat the celery, adding \"if nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my teeth.\" In the same story, while attempting to revive a feverish Peri from spectrox toxaemia, he had noted that celery was an \"excellent restorative from where I come from,\" but that the human olfactory system was \"comparatively feeble.\" Supporting this assertion, in the 2010 episode \"Cold Blood\", the Eleventh Doctor asks if there is any celery handy after being subjected to a decontamination process intended for humans (which proved potentially lethal to a Time Lord biology). The Tenth Doctor poked fun at the celery in \"Time Crash\", describing it as a \"decorative vegetable\".\n\nPeter Davison stated in an interview on the DVD of \"Castrovalva\" that he thought the clothes he wore were far too \"designed\" and that he would have still kept them, but wanted to add some individual flair to them, as other actors portraying the Doctor have done in the past. In an interview with \"BBC Breakfast\" in July 2011, Davison stated that the cricket jumper was his idea, as the producers wanted something that conveyed both action and eccentricity.\n\nDuring production of the mini-episode \"Time Crash\", it was necessary to reassemble the Fifth Doctor's costume; this was accomplished through borrowing various items from the Doctor Who exhibition in Blackpool; knitting a new cricket sweater; procuring a new hat with the original band added; and Davison wearing the trousers that were originally altered for Colin Baker in the final scene of \"The Caves of Androzani\".\n\nThe Fifth Doctor was first seen on television in the last episode of \"Logopolis\", broadcast on 21 March 1981. Davison played the role through the 19th and 20th seasons of \"Doctor Who\", including the 20th anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\". Patrick Troughton (who had played the Second Doctor) reportedly advised Davison to move on from the role after three years to avoid becoming typecast, and acting on this advice Davison informed producer John Nathan-Turner that he would leave after the 21st season. In a break from recent tradition, Nathan-Turner decided to regenerate the Doctor in the season's penultimate story, to introduce the Sixth Doctor to audiences before the seasonal break. Davison's last regular appearance as the Fifth Doctor was in the last episode of \"The Caves of Androzani\", broadcast on 16 March 1984.\n\nDavison returned to the role briefly in the 1993 charity special \"Dimensions in Time\". Beginning in 1999, he recorded a series of \"Doctor Who\" radio dramas for Big Finish Productions. In 2007, Davison, at the age of 56, appeared alongside Tenth Doctor David Tennant in a \"Doctor Who\" special for Children in Need, written by Steven Moffat and titled \"Time Crash\".\n\nImages of the Fifth Doctor are shown, alongside other incarnations, in the episodes \"The Next Doctor\" (2008) and \"The Eleventh Hour\" (2010). He also appears in \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013), via archival clips.\n\nThe Fifth Doctor has also appeared in officially licensed novels, short stories and comics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1980561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980561", "title": "Free entry", "text": "Free entry\n\nIn economics, free entry is a condition in which firms can freely enter the market for an economic good by establishing production and beginning to sell the product. The assumption of free entry impies that if there are firms earning excessively high profits in a given industry, new firms that also seek a high profit are likely to start to produce or change into a production of the same good to join the market. In such a case there are no barriers preventing a start-up firm from competing. Where an opportunity of a profit arises we assume that there will also be firms entering the market for the certain good and compete for it. In most markets this condition is present only in the long run.\n\nThe assumption of free entry doesn't mean that a firm is simply able to set up a shop without any costs incurred. It is clear that the new entrant needs to gain the capital that they need for operating in the industry. Therefore, even with a free entry to a market the entrant still has to face the same cost structure as does an already existing firm. \n\nFree entry is part of the perfect competition assumption that there are an unlimited number of buyers and sellers in a market. In conditions in which there is not a natural monopoly caused by unlimited economies of scale, free entry prevents any existing firm from maintaining a monopoly, which would restrict output and charge a higher price than a multi-firm market would.\n\nFree entry is usually accompanied by free exit, under which condition firms that are incurring losses (such as would happen if there are too many firms producing the product so that each is producing too little to be at its minimum efficient scale) can readily leave the market. However, exiting a market may involve abandonment costs.\n\nSupposing that everyone in a market for a good has access to the same technology used for production of the good and can access the same market where inputs for the production can be bought to ensure a homogenous good and a perfect competition. In such a scenario all firms have in the market and all firms that can potentially enter the market have a uniform cost curve. In the short run the number of firms in the market is fixed. The entry of such a market depends on the incentives that influence existing businesses and potential new entrants. If firms that are already present in the market have high profits it is an incentives for other firms to join the market by setting up production or changing their product of focus. This free entry in times of good profits expands the number of firms, increases the supply of the good and pulls down prices and with it the profits. In the same manner, if firms in the market are experiencing losses and low profits many firms will exit the market which will bring up prices and increase profits. Remaining firms after the entries and exits must be making a zero economic profit. This process of entries and exits eventually drives average total cost and price to become equivalent at which point the process ends and firms are producing at their efficient scale.\n\nFirms that already possess market power try to preserve it in two ways: either by trying to prevent other firms a homogenous good as they are or by stopping new entrants from joining the industry. There are some potential barriers to entry that can arise from such a situation.\n\n\n\nN. Gregory Mankiw, \"Principles of Economics\". Fort Worth: Harcourt, 2001.\n"}
{"id": "1980563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980563", "title": "Sixth Doctor", "text": "Sixth Doctor\n\nThe Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He is portrayed by Colin Baker. Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish's range of original \"Doctor Who\" audio adventures. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change. Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation, an arrogant, flamboyant character in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose brash, often patronising personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations.\n\nThe Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons. His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of \"The Caves of Androzani\" which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter in the following serial \"The Twin Dilemma\", the end of that season. The Sixth Doctor's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month \"hiatus\" between seasons 22 and 23, with only one new \"Doctor Who\" story, \"Slipback\", made on radio during the hiatus, broadcast as 6 parts (at 10 minutes each) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985, as part of a children's magazine show called \"Pirate Radio Four\". Colin Baker had been signed up for four years, as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years.\n\nPrior to its postponement, season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production. Alongside \"The Nightmare Fair\", \"The Ultimate Evil\", \"Mission to Magnus\", \"Yellow Fever and How to Cure It\", the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed. These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of the 14-episode story arc \"The Trial of a Time Lord\". The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special \"Dimensions in Time\". There are also novels and audio plays featuring the Sixth Doctor, and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s production of the show.\n\nMore so than any other canonical incarnation, aside from the Eighth Doctor, the Sixth Doctor has been heavily expanded upon in expanded universe media, most notably in audio stories produced by Big Finish Productions. In \"The Marian Conspiracy\" (2000), a new companion was introduced - Dr. Evelyn Smythe, a middle-aged history lecturer on the verge of compulsory retirement whose sharp tongue and unwillingness to tolerate the Doctor's attitude steadily taught him to rein in his more unkind tendencies. Due to this influence, the Sixth Doctor evolved into a more compassionate and likable character. In addition, beginning with the webcast \"Real Time\" (2003), his offputting costume was revised into a monochromatic blue variant, displayed on many audio stories' covers since then.\n\nThe sixth Doctor's regeneration was initially unstable, and he nearly strangled Peri before he came to his senses. Realising what he had nearly done, he initially considered going into a hermit-like existence on the planet Titan 3, only to be caught up in events on the planet Jocanda, after which he resumed his travels (\"The Twin Dilemma\"). He encountered many old foes including the Master, Daleks, Cybermen and Sontarans, and even shared an adventure with his own second incarnation in \"The Two Doctors\". He also faced a renegade female Time Lord scientist, the Rani, who was conducting experiments on humans using the Luddite riots as a cover.\n\nLater, the Doctor and Peri landed on the devastated planet Ravolox, which they discovered was actually Earth, moved across space with devastating consequences. Before they could discover the reason for this disaster, the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta. What actually happened here is unclear, but initial accounts suggest that Peri was killed after being cruelly used as a test subject in brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was pulled out of time to a Time Lord space station where he was put on trial for the second time by his own race, the Time Lords. In reality the trial was a cover-up organised by the High Council. A race from Andromeda had stolen Time Lord secrets and hidden on Earth, so to protect themselves the Time Lords had moved Earth through space, burning the surface in a massive fireball and leaving it as Ravolox. The prosecutor at that trial, the Valeyard, turned out to be a possible future evil incarnation of the Doctor himself who was out to steal his remaining lives. He had also edited the Matrix recordings of the Doctor's travels; in reality Peri had survived events on Thoros Beta. The events of the trial tangled the Doctor's timeline slightly, as he left in the company of Mel, whom he technically had not yet met.\n\nWhen the TARDIS is attacked by the Rani, the Sixth Doctor was somehow injured and regenerated into the Seventh Doctor; the exact cause of the regeneration, however, has never been revealed on-screen.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" was put on hiatus for 18 months following \"The Trial of a Time Lord\", and Colin Baker was asked to return for a single story which would have led to an event precipitating the Doctor's regeneration. As he declined to do so, there were limits as to what could be done on screen for the purposes of transitioning to a new Doctor when the series resumed with \"Time and the Rani\" and there were other unresolved questions, such as when and how the Doctor and Mel actually met. Attempts have been made by various authors to fill in these narrative gaps.\n\nThe Virgin Missing Adventures novel \"Time of Your Life\" states that the Doctor went into a self-imposed exile to avoid becoming the Valeyard. He was lured back into travelling by the Time Lords, and recruited Grant Markham as a companion. Although now travelling again, he attempted to avoid meeting Mel and recruited other companions, with the audios depicting a range of companions including history lecturer Evelyn Smythe, \"Edwardian adventuress\" Charley Pollard (a former companion of the Eighth Doctor who is rescued by the Sixth as part of a temporal paradox), supermarket check-out girl Flip Jackson, and WREN code-breaker Constance Clarke. The novel \"The Shadow in the Glass\" also depicts the Doctor working with his old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart to thwart a conspiracy to unleash a Fourth Reich led by the secret son of Adolf Hitler. The Doctor eventually encounters Mel accidentally during the events of the BBC Books novel \"Business Unusual\" and accepts his fate once she stows away in the TARDIS.\n\nPip and Jane Baker's novelisation of \"Time and the Rani\" provides the first relatively brief attempt to explain the Doctor's regeneration (specifically, that it was triggered by \"tumultuous buffeting\" as the Rani attacked the TARDIS). The Virgin New Adventures series suggests that the Seventh Doctor somehow deliberately killed the Sixth, because he could not become the masterplanner and manipulator that his next incarnation became, due to his fear of becoming the Valeyard. The BBC Books Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Spiral Scratch\" proposes that the Sixth Doctor died as a result of his chronal energy being drained in a confrontation with a powerful pan-dimensional entity before being snared by the Rani's beam. The unofficial, for-charity-published, novel \"Time's Champion\" by Craig Hinton and Chris McKeon consigns the events of \"Spiral Scratch\" to an alternate timeline, and makes the Sixth Doctor the eponymous Time's Champion, to save Mel from the clutches of the Time Lord God, Death. In these events, the Doctor, through the TARDIS' telepathic circuits, forces his own regeneration and then travels towards Lakertya, setting up the events of \"Time and the Rani\".\n\nIn 2015, Big Finish Productions released \"\", an audio drama depicting the events leading up to the Sixth Doctor's death and regeneration. According to this account, after a series of encounters with the Valeyard over the course of his life depicting the Valeyard regaining his energy after their last battle, the Sixth Doctor is essentially 'replaced' by the Valeyard, who had planted parasitic creatures in the TARDIS's telepathic circuits that formed a link with the Doctor over the course of his life, trapping the last fragments of the Doctor's personality in the Matrix. Faced with the prospect that the Valeyard, who has already replaced the Doctor's timeline so that even Mel believes he has always been the Doctor, will go on to do the same thing to every other Time Lord in history, the Sixth Doctor sends a message from the Matrix to his own past self, diverting the younger Doctor to travel to the planet Lakertya shortly before the Valeyard originally took over his timeline. As a result, the younger Doctor is exposed to radiation that is deadly to Time Lords, with his death and subsequent regeneration into the Seventh Doctor killing the parasites, stopping the Valeyard from succeeding with his plan as the regeneration 'kills' the link the parasites had created to the Doctor, but also setting up the events of \"Time and the Rani\".\n\nColin Baker wished to dress his Doctor in black velvet, to reflect his character's darker personality. Producer John Nathan-Turner, however, opted for a deliberately \"totally tasteless\" costume with clashing colours. Designer Pat Godfrey made several attempts which were considered not tasteless enough before Nathan-Turner finally accepted the last one as sufficiently garish. Colin Baker later described the outfit as \"an explosion in a rainbow factory\".\n\nThe Sixth Doctor wears a scarlet plaid frock coat, with green patchwork, and yellow and pink lapels over a white shirt with crimson question marks embroidered in the collar (a feature of the programme since 1980), a waistcoat with a fob watch, a large tie, yellow trousers with black stripes, and emerald green ankle boots with royal orange spats. There were many variants on the waistcoat and tie, the earliest being the knitted brown waistcoat and turquoise cravat tie. The waistcoat was changed to burgundy check, and in the following story a new crimson ascot tie with cream polka dots appeared. The \"future\" version of the Sixth Doctor seen aboard the \"Hyperion III\" (\"The Trial of a Time Lord\") wore a stripey waistcoat and a yellow ascot tie speckled with black stars. Baker added a cat badge to the ensemble. During Baker's run in the stage play \"Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure\", the original frock coat was replaced by a similar one with a scarlet, blue and purple colour scheme.\n\nMore recently, a royal blue version of the original costume has been used in spin-off media. First used in the webcast \"Real Time\", due to the limited availability of colours in the type of animation used, it has appeared subsequently on covers of audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. In the Big Finish audio \"Criss-Cross\", the Doctor is depicted on the cover as wearing a brown-and-scarlet tweed jacket and waistcoat with a blue-and-white striped shirt, along with a navy blue bow tie with crimson spots, while acting undercover in Bletchley Park in 1944 after the TARDIS is rendered inoperable by a strange signal. The Doctor dons this attire again, referring to it as his 'Bletchley Tweeds', when visiting Russia in 1947 in the audio \"Quicksilver\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, an unofficial Doctor Who novel Time's Champion was published, written by Chris McKeon and the late Craig Hinton. All proceeds went to the British Heart Foundation.\n\n\nPenguin Fiftieth Anniversary eBook novellas\n\nThe Sixth Doctor was featured in a number of acclaimed comic strips drawn by John Ridgway. These featured visuals and storylines of a whimsical fantasy nature, similar to Alice in Wonderland. The Sixth Doctor was somewhat calmer and more restrained than on television. All of these comic strips appeared in Doctor Who magazine in the 1980s. Colin Baker himself wrote a comic book special called \"The Age of Chaos\" in which the Sixth Doctor and Frobisher visit an older version of Peri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Clarke. It was first published in \"Playboy\" in May 1960, and reprinted in the 1962 collection \"Tales of Ten Worlds\".\n\nThe story takes the form of a non-fiction article by Clarke in which he warns the United States that the People's Republic of China is planning to, using a Russian rocket, launch a communications satellite in geostationary orbit to broadcast directly to Americans. The satellite will offer an uncensorable mix of heterosexual and homosexual pornography (using the Kinsey Report as market research), gore (such as details of bullfights and photographic evidence from the Nuremberg trials), and communist propaganda. The American ex-ad man and Communist sympathizer that reveals the plan to Clarke thanks his influential 1945 article on satellite transmission for giving China the idea, and boasts that \"History is on our side. We'll be using America's own decadence as a weapon against her, and it's a weapon for which there's no defence\".\n\nOne of the pornographic films in the story is described as depicting the erotic sculptures of the Konark Sun Temple in Odisha (Clarke uses the variant spelling of \"Konarak\").\n"}

It was manufactured for the 1902 coronation. \n\nQueen Victoria's death in January 1901 ended 64 years of the United Kingdom lacking a crowned queen consort, and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had not been crowned as a consort. Traditionally, queens consort had been crowned with the 17th century Crown of Mary of Modena. However, in 1831, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, consort of King William IV, was crowned with a 4 half-arched new small crown, the Crown of Queen Adelaide, because the Modena crown was judged too poor in quality, too old and too theatrical.\n\nIn 1902 it was decided to use neither the Modena nor Adelaide crowns for the first coronation of a queen consort in seven decades. Instead it was decided to create a brand new consort crown, to be named after Queen Alexandra.\n\nThe crown departed from the standard style of British crowns, and was more akin to European royal crowns. It was less upright than the norm in British crowns, and more squat in design, with an unprecedented eight half-arches. Its front arch joined a jewelled cross into which was set the Koh-i-Noor diamond. As with the later Crown of Queen Mary and Crown of Queen Elizabeth, the arches were detachable, allowing the crown to be worn as a circlet. \n\nThe Crown of Queen Alexandra was not worn by later queens; new crowns were created for Mary of Teck in 1911 and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937.

It amalgamated with the town of Georgetown, the rural municipalities of Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield, and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas in 2018.\n\nMontague is the largest population centre in the county and straddles the Montague River which is the dividing line between the townships of Lot 52 and Lot 59. The community functions as a regional service centre for the eastern end of the province, supporting two supermarkets, three hardware stores, a number of independent businesses, and several fast food restaurants, banks, and car dealerships.\n\nMontague is home to the Kings County Memorial Hospital, provincial government offices, and the Montague Curling Club, along with an elementary, intermediate and regional high school. The past years have seen a number of older homes and commercial buildings replaced with new, suburban style development along Main Street, particularly in the north end. A large scale redevelopment of the community's waterfront has taken place in recent years.\n\nThe community is located 44 km east of Charlottetown and 15 km southwest of Georgetown.\n\nJean-Pierre Roma, an Acadian French merchant settled in 1732 a site a few miles East of present-day Montague that he called Trois Rivieres, now The Three Rivers. It is now a designated historic site, which brings to life his story and how he established there an international trading post. Its interpretive centre is open from the last week of June to the last week of September each year. Unfortunately for him and his business, the French Army on Ile St. Jean were to be defeated by the British in 1745, in an act of ethnic cleansing the Acadian population was deported and lost all their earthly goods.\n\nAt the time of Samuel Holland's survey in the 1760s, Georgetown was designated as the shire town of Kings County. The Montague River was the southernmost of three rivers draining the area. Eventually Lower Montague, Montague Road and Montague Bridge were named after the river. The river itself traces its name to either George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan (later George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu), John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, or Montague Wilmot, Governor of Nova Scotia (which then included St. John's Island - present-day Prince Edward Island) at the time of Holland's survey. The Garden of the Gulf Museum (c. 1887 to 1888) is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.\n\nMontague is notable as the first community to combine a Wendy's restaurant and a Tim Hortons franchise under one roof. In 1992, the owner of both franchises in Prince Edward Island, Daniel P. Murphy, opened a new outlet for both brands in the same building in the community. He invited Ron Joyce and Wendy's chairman Dave Thomas to the grand opening, where the two executives met for the first time and established an immediate rapport. Murphy's success with the combined operation led to an agreement resulting in a merger of Wendy's and Tim Hortons (TDL Group) in 1995.\n\nMontague has had several modest property developments in recent decades, consisting of several subdivisions, as well as new big box retail and institutional buildings.\n\nThe bridge carrying Route 4 across the Montague River was replaced in December 2007.\n\nThe Cavendish Farms Wellness Centre, opened in 2009 on the southern edge of the community beside the existing Atlantic Fitness Centre East complex. This facility includes an Olympic sized hockey arena, municipal offices, meeting rooms, two indoor walking tracks and the local library.\n\nIn early 2010, the provincial Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Rural Development relocated from Charlottetown to a new building in downtown Montague.\n\nMontague Regional High School opened for the 2010–2011 school year at the southern edge of the community on Valleyfield Road.\n\nIn 2011, the intersection of the Wood Islands Rd (Route 4) and the Valleyfield Rd (Route 326) was replaced by Kings County's first roundabout.\n\nIn 2014, the 30-room Riverhouse Inn hotel opened, and Aspin Kemp & Associates' world headquarters relocated to Montague, along with the relocation of a construction facility for the marine supply company to nearby Poole's Corner.\n\nThe same year, Montague also received $320,000 of federal and provincial funding for cultural development, which was used in the construction of a waterfront art gallery, park construction, and the installation of several historic murals throughout the community.\n\nOn September 28, 2018, the Town of Montague amalgamated with the Town of Georgetown, five nearby rural municipalities – Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield & ndash; and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas.\n\nAs of September 28, 2018, Montague is governed by the Town of Three Rivers. The Kings District of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) serve the community from their headquarters just north of Montague, with one officer exclusively serving the community.\n\nMontague celebrates its birthday the first week after Canada day every year with an annual tradition called Montague Days, with activities including midway, buskers, soap box derby, Miss Montague contest, a pet parade,a parade (missed in 2007 due to construction of the bridge) and a fireworks display on the Montague Waterfront to wrap up the weekend long festival. The Montague Waterfront also plays host to musical acts and various other activities all weekend long. The gazebo at the waterfront was constructed by local master craftsman, Shane Phillip MacDonald. He described it as his magnum opus.\n\nMontague is home to three English Language School Board schools:\n\nThe provincial community college, Holland College, has a location in the Down East Mall, in a wing named the \"Montague Centre.\"\n\nMontague is home to several sports teams and recreation programs. It has running tracks, recreational trails, parks, and playing fields for soccer, rugby, football, field hockey, softball and baseball. The community also has a swimming pool and fitness centre along with basketball courts and nearby tennis courts. The Eastern Eagles Soccer Complex, on the southern edge of the community, is home to the regional soccer teams, the Eastern Eagles. The Eastern Eagles host a soccer tournament for other teams on Prince Edward Island and those from out of province every summer. In 2009, the Cavendish Farms Wellness Centre opened, giving a new home to the Montague Norsemen hockey teams and replacing the aging Iceland Arena. It also gave Montague junior B and senior hockey teams, the Montague Maniacs and Montague Marines. The community is also home to the Montague Curling Club, which takes in curlers from all of Kings County. Montague Regional High School and Montague Intermediate School are also home to many male and female sports teams.\n\nMontague's main attraction is the community itself, aptly named \"Montague the Beautiful\" for its tree-lined streets, tranquil river and stately buildings. Other draws include the Garden of the Gulf Museum (the oldest museum in the province), the Canada Tree, the Montague Curling Club, Cavendish Farms Wellness Centre, Montague Regional High School, the Down East Mall, Station Street Adventure Company, and Gillis' Drive-In Restaurant (in Brudenell). Montague is also a starting point of the Confederation Trail, linking many communities across P.E.I. The former train station has been renovated into a café, gift shop and information centre, looking out over the river.\nLike much of the province, the area's three main industries are fishing, farming and tourism. Montague is home to many independent businesses, along with several chains primarily in the North End. Several large employers include the new Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Rural Development, the Provincial Addictions Centre, Vital Statistics, On-Line Support, Shoppers Drug Mart, Mariner Seafoods, Cavendish Farms potato processing plant in Pooles Corner, Atlantic Superstore, and Sobeys. The community itself has no designated industrial areas, however neighbouring communities, notably Pooles Corner, have several industrial businesses.\n\nMontague has a public wharf located in Lower Montague on the South shore of the Montague River at Wightmans Point Road.\n\nThe region's weekly newspaper, the Eastern Graphic, is based in Montague. The province's main daily newspaper, The Guardian, has an office in the community.\n\n\"Greater Montague,\" which includes outlying areas outside the actual community, has a population of over 6,000. It comprises several neighbourhoods, including:\n\n\n"}

The two stations share studios on Windview Street (along I-20) in southwestern Odessa and transmitter facilities on FM 1788 in rural southeastern Andrews County.\n\nOn cable, KMID is available on Grande Communications and Reach Broadband channel 3, and on channel 2 on other systems in the market.\n\nKMID-TV went on the air on December 18, 1953; making it the longest running station in the Midland–Odessa market. It carried programming from all four networks, but was a primary NBC affiliate. It lost CBS to KOSA-TV (channel 7) in 1956 and lost ABC to KWES-TV (channel 9, then known as KVKM) in 1958. On June 11, 1981, KMID became an ABC affiliate when it swapped its NBC affiliation with channel 9 (by then known as KMOM, which became KTPX simultaneous with the switch). Lorimar-Telepictures sold KMID plus two of its sister stations, KSPR in Springfield, Missouri and KCPM-TV (now KNVN) in Chico–Redding, California, to Goltrin Communications in 1987. In 1988, Goltrin sold all three stations to Davis Goldfarb Communications. Cottonwood Communications bought the station in 1995. KMID including KSPR and KCPM (KNVN) was purchased by GOCOM Communications in 1997. KMID was acquired by current owner Nexstar Broadcasting in 2000.\n\nSince 1974, KMID was known as \"Big 2\", but adopted the \"ABC2\" moniker in early 2004. However, in part because many Permian Basin residents still called the station \"Big 2,\" that nickname was revived in 2009, only to be scrapped once more on December 12, 2015, in favor of \"Local 2.\" The \"Big 2\" branding returned again in June 2018.\n\nIn 2003, KMID dropped weekend evening newscasts, which were the lowest-rated newscasts in the Permian Basin. In late 2006, the Sunday night news broadcasts were reinstated.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, Communications Corporation of America announced the sale of its entire group to Nexstar. KPEJ was to be sold to Mission Broadcasting. However on June 6, 2014, Nexstar announced that it would instead sell KPEJ-TV to a new minority-owned company, Marshall Broadcasting Group (marking the company's first television station acquisitions), for $58.5 million. Nexstar would operate KPEJ under a shared services agreement, forming a virtual duopoly with KMID. The sale was completed on January 1, 2015.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKMID shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nSyndicated programming on KMID includes \"The Rachael Ray Show\", \"Judge Judy\", \"AgDay\", \"Jeopardy!\", and \"Wheel of Fortune\", among others.\n\n\n\n"}

The grassland is located in the South Platte River basin in remote northern and extreme northeastern Weld County between Greeley and Sterling. It comprises two parcels totaling largely between State Highway 14 and the Wyoming border. The larger eastern parcel lies adjacent to the borders of both Nebraska and Wyoming. It is administered in conjunction with the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest from the U.S. Forest Service office in Fort Collins, Colorado, with a local ranger district office in Greeley.\n\nThe grassland is in an especially depopulated area of the Great Plains. It saw limited cultivation in the early 20th century but was withdrawn from farming after the Dust Bowl. The communities of Keota and Purcell are located within the grassland. The town of Grover is located directly between the two large parcels of the grasslands near the Crow Creek. Briggsdale sits at the southern end where State Highway 14 and State Highway 392 meet. State Highway 71 traverses the eastern unit north of Stoneham. The eastern unit is drained by Pawnee Creek, a tributary of the South Platte. The western unit is largely drained by Crow Creek.\n\nCamping is available at the Crow Valley Recreation Area northwest of Briggsdale. The grassland contains several hiking trails, including one that allows foot access to the Pawnee Buttes, the most notable geologic feature of the grasslands. Bird watching is a popular recreational activity for day hikers, especially at the Chalk Bluffs, a raptor nesting site.\n\nRecreational activities on the Pawnee Grasslands have been somewhat curtailed over the last 10 years due to the discovery of extractable oil and natural gas. According to the US Forest Service there are 63 active vertical oil and natural gas wells, and less than 3,000 acres from the 193,060 acres is protected from drilling.\n\nThe grassland is a joining of two soil types. In the east are prairie soils that are deep, and dark or reddish. From the west are chernozems of a chestnut, becoming brown. The chestnut soils are the dominant type across the areas. These soils develop in semiarid climates with of rain annually. They are associated with buffalo grass and blue grama. Around the buttes, the soils are most likely brown soils which are characteristic of cool, semiarid condition and are evidenced by short grasses and shrubs.\n\nWater is available from a Cretaceous period aquifer. Three springs are in the vicinity of the buttes: Nelson Ranch ( north), old Linglebach Homestead ( south), and an arroyo ( west). The main access to the aquifer is by windmill pumps. The aquifer is recharged from the west and flows eastward. There are Tertiary and Quaternary aquifers which are recharged by precipitation and seepage from streams. The Brule Formation, where available provides a large quantity of water.\n\nThe grassland is a part of the short grass plains of North America. The best example of this ecosystem are preserved around the Pawnee Buttes where grazing and intensive agriculture have had less impact. There are eleven vegetation zones represented with the most unique being the scarp woodlands on the north face of the buttes. Typical of higher elevations, there are limber pines and relicts of an ice-age forest.\n\nThe wildlife of the grasslands is best represented near the buttes, with pronghorn, deer, bison, prairie dog, wolves, coyotes, rabbits, and numerous rodents. Nesting birds include the golden eagle and prairie falcons .\n\n\nWildflowers bloom from April through September. The best locations for viewing wildflowers are near rocky outcrops or wet potholes, such as are found near the Pawnee Buttes.\n\n\n"}

In addition to being a public secondary school, the school is also host to the Claude Watson Arts Program, an auditioned arts program integrated into the secondary school curriculum.\n\nThe school is named after Field Marshal The 1st Earl Haig, who was commander of the British Expeditionary Force during the majority of the First World War. The school was established in 1928, shortly after Earl Haig's death.\n\nThe original school was designed by the Toronto architectural firm of Craig and Madill and construction started in November 1929. The building officially opened in 1930 as Earl Haig Collegiate Institute. Additions were made in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. In 1961, the school changed its name from Earl Haig Collegiate Institute to Earl Haig Secondary School. It is currently the largest high school in the Toronto District School Board.\n\nThe Claude Watson Arts Program began in 1982. The program consists of dance, drama, music, film arts, and visual arts.\n\nIn 1996, the original building was demolished in sections to make way for a new building. This new building was designed around the original auditorium, Cringan Hall. Carruthers Shaw and Partners Limited, the same company that designed buildings at Queen's University and Upper Canada College, designed the new building and Bondfield Construction were contracted to build the school. The new building was officially opened in September 1997 at a cost of $30,800,000. \nFor many years, the school participated in the Canadian National Math League (CNML), Canadian Open Math Competition (COMC), Canadian Intermediate/Senior Math Competitions (CIMC/CSMC), Pascal/Cayley/Fermat, Fryer/Galois/Hypatia, and Euclid math contests.

It's the third largest city in Pichincha Province. \n\nCayambe's indigenous people of today are descendants of the pre-Inca Kayambi people. The Kayambi were resistant to Inca expansion and were only definitively conquered by Huayna Capac (the eleventh Sapa Inca of the Inca Empire) after a bloody 20-year war.

In 1950, with the Montreal Junior Canadiens and in 1958, with the Ottawa Junior Canadiens, he won the Memorial Cup. The Montreal Canadiens saw potential in Pollock and quickly hired him to be the successor to Frank J. Selke, serving as Personnel Director from 1959 to 1964. In 1964, Selke retired and Sam took over his job as general manager of the Habs.\n\nHe spent 14 years with the club as general manager giving up the job in summer of 1978. He spent one last season with Montreal on their board of directors, before retiring in summer of 1979. Pollock's name was included on the Stanley Cup 12 times, including an NHL record nine as a manager. Pollock and head coach Scotty Bowman not only presided over a Canadiens dynasty, but many of their players went on to have successful coaching and managing roles with other own teams.\n\nPollock died on August 15, 2007, at the age of 81 in Toronto, Ontario. Pollock is survived by his wife Mimi, son Sam Jr., and daughters Rachel and Mary. Pollock was buried at Ste Elisabeth Roman Catholic Cemetery in North Hatley, Quebec.\n\nPollock believed drafting good young prospects was the key to long term success in the NHL. To this end he was always planning, sometimes years in advance, in order to be in position to pick up the \"cream of the crop\" in any annual entry level draft.\n\nAmong one of his shrewdest moves, was a series of trades in which the Canadiens obtained the first overall pick in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft, the year in which Guy Lafleur would be eligible. It appeared as if the first overall selection would be held by the California Golden Seals so he persuaded Seals owner Charlie Finley to trade the Seals' pick and François Lacombe in return for Montreal's first round pick and a 23-year-old rookie, Ernie Hicke. Pollock hesitated between Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne, but chose Lafleur with his overall no.1 pick.\n\nOn another occasion he traded two college prospects to Boston for a young goalie named Ken Dryden. He was also instrumental in acquiring Larry Robinson, Serge Savard, Guy Lapointe and Yvan Cournoyer, all of whom would become superstars for the Canadiens.\n\nIn another deal, one which was never consummated, New York Islanders GM Bill Torrey drafted defenceman Denis Potvin first overall in the 1973 entry draft, Pollock approached Torrey, hoping to trade for Potvin. Pollock's strategy was to offer a \"quick-fix\" package of mature players in exchange for the top draft pick. Although it was tempting, as the Islanders would immediately benefit from the trade, Torrey ultimately turned down the offer. Potvin went on to be a long-term asset to the Islanders, leading them to 4 consecutive Stanley Cups and anchoring their blueline for 15 years.\n\n\nPollock served as CEO and chair of the Toronto Blue Jays from 1995 to 2000.\n\n"}

It was previously known as Bournemouth East (1885 to 1899) and then Bournemouth Central (1899 to 1967). It has long been treated as an obligatory stop (major stop) on the South Western Main Line from London Waterloo to Weymouth. It is down the main line from Waterloo and is situated between and .\n\nA previous incarnation of Bournemouth East station was on another site. Ticket barriers were installed in 2008 and British Transport Police have a Bournemouth office at the station which acts as a regional hub.\n\nThe station was designed by William Jacob, chief engineer of the London and South Western Railway, and opened on 20 July 1885 as \"Bournemouth East\" replacing the original station of the same name on the other side of Holdenhurst Road from 1870 to 1885, see Bournemouth East railway station (Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway). The station was over 1–km from the town centre on the insistence of town authorities of the time. It was renamed \"Bournemouth Central\" on 1 May 1899 and became \"Bournemouth\" on 10 July 1967 following the closure of Bournemouth West. By 1967 third rail electrification had reached Bournemouth and continued beyond to Branksome and Bournemouth Train & Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot but no further. From the end of steam most trains were formed of 4REP EMUs coupled up with one or more unpowered 4TC units. The 4TC units would be uncoupled at Bournemouth and attached to a Class 33/1 diesel locomotive for the onward journey to Weymouth. This continued until the electrification of the line from Branksome to Weymouth and the introduction of Class 442 units in 1988. The end of steam also saw the removal of the station's centre tracks which ran between the up and down lines serving platforms 2 and 3 respectively and the demolition of the locomotive sheds to the west; the station car park took over their site.\n\nThe station roof was severely damaged by the Great Storm of 1987 that hit the South of England. It was extensively refurbished in 2000 by Railtrack after many years of disrepair and being surrounded by scaffolding to protect people from falling debris.\n\nTicket barriers were installed in 2008.\n\nBournemouth railway station was once served by services and goods deliveries across five railways, the South Western Main Line, Southampton and Dorchester Railway, Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway, Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.\n\nOn 2 September 1961, a train was derailed by trap points at the end of the down platform (towards the west).\n\nThe station has four platforms:\nPlatforms 3 and 4 are continuous, and both can accommodate full-length trains. This means Bournemouth has one of the longest platforms in the country. Other stations with this arrangement include Gloucester, Cambridge and Edinburgh Waverley.\n\nA small locomotive depot was opened at Bournemouth East in 1870, but closed in 1883. This was replaced by a larger shed, adjacent to Bournemouth Central station, in 1883. This in turn was supplemented by another shed nearby in 1888. In 1921, the 1883 shed was closed and the 1888 one was extended to increase capacity, and between 1936 and 1938 this was rebuilt and enlarged. The new shed included a turntable and a hoist. However the facilities remained cramped and awkwardly sited; there were proposals to move the depot to Branksome which were never implemented. This site therefore remained in use until June 1967 when the site was cleared.\n\nThe station is primarily served by South Western Railway, who operate fast and semi-fast trains from London Waterloo to Weymouth, and stopping services from London Waterloo to Poole.\n\nCrossCountry operate services from Bournemouth to Manchester Piccadilly via Birmingham New Street. There is one CrossCountry service Monday to Saturday only from but no return working. All CrossCountry services at Bournemouth use Voyagers. Before the CrossCountry service was standardised in 2007 there were for many years CrossCountry services to many other destinations, including the \"Dorset Scot, Pines Express\" and \"Wessex Scot\" and other trains to Scotland via both the West Coast Main Line and East Coast Main Line, along with trains to and to Liverpool Lime Street.\n\nIn May 1994, Network SouthEast extended its service London Victoria to Southampton service to terminate at Bournemouth. It was truncated back to Southampton in the 2000s by Southern. The service was one of the few regular services to use platform 1.\n\nBournemouth railway station also serves as a hub for local bus services. On the down side of the station is Bournemouth Travel Interchange which is served by Wilts & Dorset and Yellow Buses, both companies operate frequent services to the town centre. A regular bus service to Bournemouth Airport, the Bournemouth Airport Shuttle, is operated by Yellow Buses. It is also a stop on National Express coach routes which serve the town.\n"}

{"id": "1980664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980664", "title": "Agriculture in the Empire of Japan", "text": "Agriculture in the Empire of Japan\n\nAgriculture in the Empire of Japan was an important component of the pre-war Japanese economy. Although Japan had only 16% of its land area under cultivation before the Pacific War, over 45% of households made a living from farming. Japanese cultivated land was mostly dedicated to rice, which accounted for 15% of world rice production in 1937.\n\nAfter the end of the Tokugawa shogunate with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japanese agriculture was dominated by a tenant farming system. The Meiji government based its industrialization program on tax revenues from private land ownership, and the Land Tax Reform of 1873 increased the process of landlordism, with many farmers having their land confiscated due to inability to pay the new taxes.\n\nThis situation was worsened by the deflationary Matsukata Fiscal Policy of 1881-1885, which severely depressed rice prices, leading to further bankruptcies, and even to large scale rural uprisings against the government. By the end of the Meiji period, over 67% of all peasant families were driven into tenancy, and farm productivity stagnated. As tenants were forced to pay over half their crop as rent, they were often forced to send wives and daughters to textile mills or to sell daughters into prostitution to pay for taxes.\n\nIn the early Meiji period, landowners collected a high rate of rent in kind, rather than cash and consequently played a major role in the development of agriculture, since the tenant farmers found it difficult to obtain capital. Gradually, with the development of cash crops to supplement the mainstay of rice, and the growth of capitalism in general from the turn of the twentieth century onwards, agricultural cooperatives and the government took over the role by providing farm subsidies, loans, and education in new agricultural techniques.\n\nThe first agricultural cooperatives were established in 1900, after their creation was debated in the Diet of Japan by Shinagawa Yajirō and Hirata Tosuke as a means of modernizing Japanese agriculture and adapting it to a cash economy. These cooperatives served in rural areas as credit unions, purchasing cooperatives and assisted in the marketing and sales of farm products.\n\nThe was a central organization for agricultural cooperatives in the Empire of Japan. It was established in 1910, and provided assistance to individual cooperatives through transmission of agricultural research and facilitating the sales of farm products. The Imperial Agricultural Association was at the peak of a three tier structure of national-prefectural-local system of agricultural cooperatives. This organization was of vital importance after nationwide markets were consolidated under government control in the aftermath of the Rice Riots of 1918 and increasing economic crisis from the late 1920s. Increasing tenant farmer disputes and issues with landlordism also led to increasing government regulation.\n\nAfter the Rice Riots of 1918, many peasants came under the influence of the urban labor movement with socialist, communist and/or agrarian ideas, which created a serious political issues. Not only were the Imperial Family of Japan and the \"zaibatsu\" major landowners, but until 1928, an income tax requirement severely limited the right to vote, limiting seats in the Diet of Japan only to people of wealth. In 1922, the Nihon Nomin Kumiai (Japan Farmer's Union) was formed for collective bargaining for cultivator rights and reduced rents.\n\nBy the 1930s, the growth of the urban economy and flight of farmers to the cities gradually weakened the hold of the landlords. The interwar years also saw the rapid introduction of mechanized agriculture, and the supplementation of natural animal fertilizers with chemical fertilizers and imported phosphates.\n\nWith the growth of the wartime economy, the government recognized that landlordism was an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation of the in 1943, which was a compulsory organization under the wartime command economy to force the implementation of government farming policies. Another duty of the organization was to secure food supply to local markets and the military. It was dissolved after World War II.\n\nFarmed land in 1937 was 14,940,000 acres (60,460 km²), which represented 15.8% of the total Japanese surface area, compared with 10,615,000 acres (42,957 km²) or 40% in Ohio (USA), or 12,881,000 acres (52,128 km²) or 21% in England. The proportion of farmed land rose from 11.8% in 1887 to 13.7% in 1902, and 14.4% in 1912 to 15.7% in 1919. This fell to 15.4% in 1929. There were 5,374,897 farmers at an average 2.67 acres (11,000 m²) per family, in comparison with any American farmer family with 155 acres (627,000 m²). These were larger in Hokkaidō and Karafuto and reduced by 2 acres (8,000 m²) in southwest area. The intense culture, fertilizers and scientific development, raised the yield to 43 bushels per acre (2.89 t/ha) in 1936.\n\nIn some parts of southern Japan, the subtropical climate favored a double harvest. Other important cereals were wheat, maize, rye, millet barley; with potatoes and some production of soybean.\n\nThe sparsely populated Chishima Islands had an inclement climate for anything other than small-scale agriculture; the economy was based the fishing, whaling, and harvest of furs and reindeer meat.\n\nKarafuto likewise had a severe climate made cultivation difficult, along with unsuitable podzolic soils. Small scale farming was developed in the south, were land was suitable for potatoes, oats, rye, forage, and vegetables. Only 7% of Karafuto was arable. The livestock raising was quite important. Farming experiments with rice were partially successful. Through government policies, capable farmers from Hokkaidō and northern Honshū received to of land and a house to settle in Karafuto, and thus the amount of land under cultivation and the Japanese population rose steadily through the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, 10,811 families were cultivating 86,175 acres (348.74 km²), as opposed to 8,755 families cultivating 179.9 km² in 1926.\n\nHokkaidō was a target area for agricultural development since the start of the Meiji period, with the establishment of the Hokkaidō colonization Office, and with the assistance of numerous foreign advisors who introduced new crops and new agricultural techniques. Hokkaidō farms averaged 11 acres (48,000 m²), more than four times others in Japan. Despite efforts to cultivate rice on about 60% of the arable land in the territory, climate and soils were not favorable and yields were low. Other crops included oats, potatoes, vegetables, rye and wheat as well as extensive horticulture. The dairy industry was important, as was the raising of horses for use by the Imperial Japanese Army cavalry.\n\nFarmer households numbered 2,000,000 and the government mentioned the possibility to establish another 1,000,000.\n\nThe farms were 3.5 to 4 acres (14,000 to 16,000 m²), for rice, potatoes, rice, and rye. Northern Honshū produced 75% of apples of Japan; other products included cherries and horses. Central Honshū cultivated rice and special products including white mulberry (for silkworms) in Suwa, tea, (in Shizuoka), daikon in Aichi, and also rye, rice, grapes for wine, etc.\n\nDue to subtropical conditions, Shikoku and Kyūshū islands were dominated by traditional rice and sweet potato crops. Other important crops included sugar cane, bananas, Japanese citrus, tobacco, taro, and beans. Other products obtained in the highlands included rye, wheat, morel, silk and livestock raising (horses and cows).\n\nThe tropical Ryūkyū Islands with their limited cultivatable area had a largely subsistence agriculture based on rice, sweet potatoes, sugar cane and fruits.\n\nWith a large ethnic Chinese population, agricultural methods and products in Taiwan were in the Chinese-style, with rice cultivation and sweet potatoes dominating. Cash crops included fruits and tea and jute & ramie. (The cultivated land was 2,116,174 acres (8,563.85 km²) at a density of 1,576 inhabitants per square mile in 1937.\n\nThe central government gave strong emphasis on development of the sugar cane industry, and Taiwan satisfied 42% of the crude sugar demand of Japan. The consumption of sugar in Japan grew from 15 lb (7 kg) in 1918 to 30 lb (14 kg) in 1928.\n\nThe central government also placed strong emphasis on the development of forestry products. Camphor wood was collected from forests or plantations under a government-monopoly (the \"Formosa Manufacturing Company\" from 1899).\n\nThe equatorial tropical conditions of the South Seas Mandate islands supported farming of coconuts, taro, sweet potatoes, tapioca, bananas, pineapples and rice, for local use and export. The sugar cane industry was given strong emphasis by the central government, with principal sugar in Saipan and Palau. However, the very limited cultivable land area of the South Pacific Mandate meant that fishing and whaling remained more economically important.\n\nPrior to the Pacific War there was a small Japanese settlement in Davao at the south of Mindanao Island which worked with Japanese private companies to cultivate abacá for Manila hemp. This was the main center of cultivation in the region, with farming of sugar cane, pineapple, bananas, sweet potato and other tropical crops. Abaca farming exceeded sugar cane cultivation in area but not in value. 25% was sent to the USA. Sisal was also exported to the USA and Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

At the time, Japan had one of the largest merchant fleets in the world with a total of approximately 6 million tonnes of displacement before December 1941. Despite heavy naval losses during the Pacific War, Japan was still left with 4,700,000 tonnes.\n\nDespite popular perception, during the 1930s Japan was exporting low-cost items successfully. However, between the years of 1929 and 1938 foreign commerce dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%. Japan ran a trade deficit, selling a total of US$12.85 and buying US$15.25 per capita. This was in part brought on by the purchase of wartime materials.\n\nJapan's primary trading partners in order were:\n\n\nJapan exported 32% of its total output to the United States, and purchased 21% of its foreign trade.\n\nJapan's imports were as follows:\n\nJapan's exports were as follows:\n\nJapan's primary exports were raw silk, controlling 80% of the world's production, and tea, controlling 10%.\n\nJapan's total foreign trade was equivalent to Belgium, a country with less than 10% of Japan's population.\n\nIn 1897, the local monetary unit, the yen, was valued on the gold standard at a base level of 24.5 British Pence, which permits the use in the figures of the pound sterling or gold-backed US dollars.\n\nDuring the worldwide depression (1931 to 1934), Japanese exterior commerce grew. The expansion of this trade was in part due to European difficulties in supplying their colonies, allowing Japan to expand into new markets. Before the war, crude silk represented one-third of exports and 10% of processed silk. Other products for export were rayon, cotton, processed silk and others. In 1937 exports were crude silk, cotton fabrics, and rayon. Japan was importing raw cotton, wool, and oil imported products.\n\nJapan was the first Asiatic independent state to export manufactured objects (e.g., silks, fabrics) and the first to import machinery and raw materials.\n\nThe metal-based manufacturing industry was not very active in 1918 exports, but porcelain, paper and matches were sold, and sugar and tea were exported from Formosa.\n\nIn imports raw materials represented around 60%, as raw cotton, unfinished metals and machinery, and foodstuffs at 14%.\n\nFor more numbers, see the following statistics from 1890 to 1927:\n\nIn 1925, external trade was equivalent of 404 French francs per inhabitant (the nominal monetary value of the Yen at the time was 12.72 Frs., with exchange variations between 13.60 in 1918 to 10.46 during 1925.) In 1926, the general value of exports was 2,045 million Yen, the imports 2,377 million\nYen. During 1927, numbers were slightly down at 1,992 million of Yen in sellings and 2,179 in buyings.\n\nOther Japanese statistics (1900 to 1925) in thousands of Yen (one Yen equalled 5 Spanish pesetas in 1925)\n\nThe total of these exports in the same years:\n\n\nMore than 90% of Chosen's exterior commerce was with Japan and Manchukuo. In 1939, Chosen was importing $300,000,000 worth of goods and exporting $250,000,000 worth of goods, a deficit which continued for years.\n\nThe principal articles for export were:\n\nThe principal imports were:\n\nMore than 16,000,000 tonnes of merchant vessels entered the province in 1936 via Fusan, the fourth largest port in the Japanese Empire.\n\nJapanese industry and commerce became focused on export and foreign sales, and the local markets unsatisfied because of low demand.\n\n\nJapanese companies had invested 18,560,000 Yen in the Dutch East Indies (Sumatra and Borneo) and some 51,195,000 Yen in rubber plantations in the British Straits Settlements (British Malaya) (260 km² in major production from 1927).\n\nJapanese capital investment in China to 1927 was 1900 million Yen. Apart from Manchuria, the Japanese interests were concentrated in the Yangtze Basin areas (Shanghai, Hankow-Wuhan, Kiangsi). Japanese banking interests financed 50% of the Chinese cotton industry sector.\n\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tons. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tons. In 1924 there were 237 new vessels of 500 tons and another 11 of 10,000 tonnes, continuing the growth to 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest in the world behind the British and American navies, and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern shipyard was founded in 1891. From this time naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese vessels of more 100 tonnes represented a registered tonnage total of 5,007,000 tonnes of which 1,198,000 corresponded to the naval construction period of 1936 to 1938. Old vessels were decommissioned or disarmed, while the regular fleet was efficient and modern.\n\nIn peacetime Japan constructed a lower annual figure of 500,000 tonnes of shipping. Japan still rivalled Norway for third place in the world merchant fleet. Its vessels were of lower quality. Almost 1,000,000 tonnes were of the modern type, but the larger part of the current fleet was antiquated, with only half-a-dozen vessels of tonnage over 10,000 tonnes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1980717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980717", "title": "Drizzle", "text": "Drizzle\n\nDrizzle is a light liquid precipitation consisting of liquid water drops smaller than those of rain – generally smaller than in diameter. Drizzle is normally produced by low stratiform clouds and stratocumulus clouds. Precipitation rates from drizzle are on the order of a millimetre (0.04 in) per day or less at the ground. Owing to the small size of drizzle drops, under many circumstances drizzle largely evaporates before reaching the surface and so may be undetected by observers on the ground. The METAR code for drizzle is DZ and for freezing drizzle is FZDZ.\n\nWhile most drizzle has only a minor immediate impact upon humans, freezing drizzle can lead to treacherous conditions. Freezing drizzle occurs when supercooled drizzle drops land on a surface whose temperature is below freezing. These drops immediately freeze upon impact, leading to the buildup of sheet ice (sometimes called black ice) on the surface of roads.\n\nDrizzle tends to be the most frequent form of precipitation over large areas of the world's oceans, particularly in the colder regions of the subtropics. These regions are dominated by shallow marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds, which exist entirely within the marine boundary layer. Despite the low rates of surface accumulation, it has become apparent that drizzle exerts a major influence over the structure, coverage, and radiative properties of clouds in these regions.\n\nThis has motivated scientists to design more sophisticated and sensitive instruments such as high-frequency radars that can detect drizzle. These studies have shown that the quantity of drizzle is strongly linked to cloud morphology and tends to be associated with updrafts within the marine boundary layer. Increased amounts of drizzle tend to be found in marine clouds that form in clean air masses that have low concentrations of cloud droplets. This interconnection between clouds and drizzle can be explored using high-resolution numerical modelling such as large eddy simulation.\n\nIt has been hypothesized by a group of atmospheric scientists at Texas A&M University that particulates in the atmosphere caused by human activities may suppress drizzle. According to this hypothesis, because drizzle can be an effective means of removing moisture from a cloud, its suppression could help to increase the thickness, coverage, and longevity of marine stratocumulus clouds. This would lead to increased cloud albedo on a regional to global scale, and a cooling effect on the atmosphere. Estimates using complex global climate models suggest that this effect may be partially masking the effects of greenhouse gas increases on global surface temperature. However, it is not clear that the representation of the chemical and physical processes needed to accurately simulate the interaction between aerosols, clouds, and drizzle in our current climate models is sufficient to fully understand the global impacts of changes in particulates.\n\n"}

He was the son of the 1st Marquis de Ruvigny, a distinguished French diplomat, and a nephew of Rachel, the wife of William Russell, Lord Russell. He was a soldier and served in the French army under Turenne, who thought very highly of him. Probably on account of his English connections he was selected in 1678 by Louis XIV to carry out the secret negotiations for a compact with Charles II, a difficult mission which he executed with great skill. He succeeded his father as general of the Huguenots, and refused Louis's offer, at the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, to retain him in that office. In 1690, having gone into exile with his fellow Huguenots, he entered the service of William III of England as a major-general, thereby forfeiting his French estates.\n\nIn July 1691 he distinguished himself at the Battle of Aughrim, and in 1692 he was for a time commander-in-chief in Ireland. In November of that year he was created Viscount Galway and Baron Portarlington, and received a large grant of seized estates in Ireland. The title had previously belonged to Ulick Burke, 1st Viscount Galway, a Jacobite officer who had been killed at Aughrim.\n\nIn 1693 he fought at Neerwinden and was wounded. In 1694, with the rank of lieutenant-general, he was sent to command a force in English pay that was to assist the Duke of Savoy against the French, and at the same time to relieve the distressed Vaudois. In 1695 Savoy changed sides, the Italian peninsula was neutralised, and Galway's force was withdrawn to the Netherlands. From 1697 to 1701, a critical period of Irish history, the Earl of Galway (he was advanced to that rank in 1697) was practically in control of Irish affairs as Lord Justice of Ireland. After some years spent in retirement, he was appointed in 1704 to command the allied forces in Portugal, a post which he sustained with honour and success until the Battle of Almanza in 1707, in which Galway, in spite of care and skill on his own part, was decisively defeated by the Duke of Berwick. His aide de camp was Hector Francois Chataigner de Cramahé, son in law of Jacques de Belrieu, Baron de Virazel.\n\nGalway scraped together a fresh army, and, although infirm, was reappointed to his command by the home government. He took part in one more campaign, and distinguished himself by his personal bravery in action. Marquis de Bay defeated him at the Battle of La Gudina. After this, he retired from active life. His last service was rendered in 1715, when he was sent as one of the lords justices to Ireland during the Jacobite insurrection. As most of his property in Ireland had been restored to its former owners, and all his French estates had long before been forfeited, Parliament voted him pensions amounting to 1500 pounds a year. He died unmarried. The Irish peerage died with him, but not the French marquisate.\n\nThe French Hospital was incorporated under the Great Seal in 1718, with Galway as its governor.\n"}

They are \"deep\" in the sense that the energy required to remove an electron or hole from the trap to the valence or conduction band is much larger than the characteristic thermal energy \"kT\", where \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant and \"T\" is the temperature. Deep traps interfere with more useful types of doping by \"compensating\" the dominant charge carrier type, annihilating either free electrons or electron holes depending on which is more prevalent. They also directly interfere with the operation of transistors, light-emitting diodes and other electronic and opto-electronic devices, by offering an intermediate state inside the band gap. Deep-level traps shorten the non-radiative life time of charge carriers, and—through the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) process—facilitate recombination of minority carriers, having adverse effects on the semiconductor device performance.\n\nCommon chemical elements that produce deep-level defects in silicon include iron, nickel, copper, gold, and silver. In general, transition metals produce this effect, while light metals such as aluminium do not.\n\nSurface states and crystallographic defects in the crystal lattice can also play role of deep-level traps.\n"}

Herodotus reports how the Persian attackers who tried to exploit an unusual retreat of the water were suddenly surprised by \"a great flood-tide, higher, as the people of the place say, than any one of the many that had been before\". In 2012 researchers from Aachen University announced that they had discovered evidence that the area should be included among Greek regions prone to tsunamis.\n\nTsunami are generally associated with earthquakes, but Herodotus, the source of this story, makes no mention of an earthquake at the time. This makes it more likely that the event was a meteotsunami. Not only are such events relatively common in the Mediterranean, but their effect is amplified in a long, narrow body of water - which is a good description for the situation of Potidaea, which lies at the head of Toroneos Gulf.\n\nDuring the time of the Delian League, conflicts occurred between Athens and Corinth. However, the Corinthians still sent a supreme magistrate each year. Potidaea was inevitably involved in all of the conflicts between Athens and Corinth. The people revolted against the Athenians in 432 BC, and it was besieged at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War and taken in the Battle of Potidaea in 430 BC.\n\nThe Athenians retook the city in 363 BC, but in 356 BC Potidaea fell into the hands of Philip II of Macedon. Potidaea was destroyed and its territory handed to the Olynthians. Cassander built a city on the same site which was named Cassandreia. It was probably at this time that the canal, which still exists today, was dug through the sandy soil at the narrowest part of the isthmus, perhaps with the aim of making the city a naval base. In 43 BC a Roman colony was settled by the proconsul of Macedonia, which in 30 BC was resettled by Octavian (the future Augustus) and took the official name Colonia Iulia Augusta Cassandrensis.\n\nThe modern settlement of Nea Poteidaia, built for refugees from Asia Minor after the First World War, is situated near this ancient site.\n\nIn popular culture, the fictional character Gabrielle from the TV series was described as being from Potidaea.\n\n\n"}

Its baroque architecture includes a hall of mirrors based on the principle of a catoptric cistula in 2018, a young American author, composer, interpreter and designer, Krysle Lip was in charge of the artistic and esthetical transformation of the Hall of Mirrors The hall of mirrors was built for the Exposition Universelle in 1900.\nIt was originally housed in the \"Palais des mirages\" designed by Eugène Hénard.\n\nThe Musée Grévin now contains some 450 characters arranged in scenes from the history of France and modern life, including a panorama of French history from Charlemagne to Napoleon III and bloody scenes of the French Revolution, with the original wax figures of the late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessing their technical evolution. By contrast, the more contemporaneous movie stars, athletes, and international figures such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Shah Rukh Khan, Pablo Picasso, Michael Jackson, Josephine Baker and Pope John Paul II use the modern techniques of modeling. The tableau of Charlotte Corday murdering Jean-Paul Marat created in 1889 includes the actual knife and bathtub used.\n\nNew wax characters are regularly added to the Museum among more than 2000 made since it opened. They include Zinedine Zidane, Jean Reno, Monica Bellucci, Jean Dujardin, Isabelle Adjani and Nolwenn Leroy.\n\nBollywood celebrities whose wax has been added include Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Ranveer Singh.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1872, it became the oldest humor magazine in the world when \"Punch\" folded in 2002.\n\n\"The Record\" is currently published eight times during the academic year and is distributed in Yale residential college dining halls and around the nation through subscriptions. Content from the magazine is made available online and entire issues can be downloaded in .pdf form.\n\n\"The Record\" began as a weekly newspaper, with its first issue appearing on September 11, 1872. Almost immediately, it became a home to funny writing (often in verse form), and later, when printing technology made it practical, humorous illustrations. \"The Record\" thrived immediately, and by the turn of the century had a wide circulation outside of New Haven—at prep schools, other college towns, and even New York City.\n\nAs Yale became one of the bellwethers of collegiate taste and fashion (especially for the younger universities looking East), so too \"The Record\" became a model—F. Scott Fitzgerald referred to the magazine as one of the harbingers of the new, looser morality of collegians of that time. But it wasn't just laughs \"The Record\" was serving up—during the 1920s, \"The Record\" ran a popular speakeasy in the basement of its building at 254 York Street (designed by Lorenzo Hamilton and completed in 1928).\n\nAlong with the \"Princeton Tiger Magazine\" (1878), the \"Stanford Chaparral\" (1899), and the \"Harvard Lampoon\" (1876), among many college humor magazines, \"The Record\" created a wide-ranging, absurdist style of comedy which mixed high-culture references with material dealing with the eternal topics of schoolwork, alcohol, and sex (or lack thereof). Comedy first published in the magazine was re-printed in national humor magazines like \"Puck\" and \"Judge\". \nIn 1914, J.L. Butler of \"The Yale Record\" and Richard Sanger of \"The Harvard Lampoon\" created the first annual banquet of the College Comics Association, which drew representatives from 14 college humor magazines to New Haven. The college humor style influenced—or in some cases led directly to—the Marx Brothers, \"The New Yorker\", \"Playboy\", \"Mad\" magazine, underground comics, \"National Lampoon\", The Second City, and \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nThe character \"Whit\" (pronounced \"wit\") in the Sinclair Lewis story \"Go East, Young Man\" drew caricatures for the \"Yale Record\".\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1960s, \"The Record\" placed special emphasis on cartooning, which led many of its alumni to work at \"Esquire\" magazine and especially \"The New Yorker\". \"Record\" cartoonists during this time period included Peter Arno, Reginald Marsh, Clarence Day, Julien Dedman, Robert C. Osborn, James Stevenson, William Hamilton and Garry Trudeau.\n\nFrom 1920 through the 1940s, many \"Record\" staffers and alums contributed to \"College Humor\", a popular nationally distributed humor magazine. Additionally, comedy first published in \"The Record\" was re-printed in national humor magazines like \"Life\" and \"College Humor\".\n\nBy the late 1940s, the magazine's ties to \"The New Yorker\" were so strong that designers from that magazine consulted on \"The Record\"'s layout and design. \n\nBy the 1950s, the \"Record\" had established the \"Cartoonist of the Year\" award, which brought people like Walt Kelly, the creator of \"Pogo\", to New Haven to dine and swap stories with the staff.\n\nIn the early 1960s, cartoons and comic writing from the magazine were regularly re-printed in Harvey Kurtzman's \"Help!\", a satirical magazine that helped launch the careers of Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, R. Crumb, Woody Allen, John Cleese, Gloria Steinem and many others. \n\nIn the late 1960s, the magazine played an integral role in editor-in-chief Garry Trudeau's creation of his epochal strip \"Doonesbury\". Trudeau published the pre-syndication \"Doonesbury\" collection \"Michael J.\" (1970) through \"The Yale Record\". In addition to editing the \"Record\", Trudeau (and \"Record\" chairman Tim Bannon, basis of \"Doonesbury\" attorney T.F. Bannon of Torts, Tarts & Torque) organized \"Record\" events such as a successful Annette Funicello film festival, a Tarzan film festival (with guest Johnny Weissmuller) and a Jefferson Airplane concert featuring Sha Na Na.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s are known as the \"Dark Ages\" amongst \"Record\" staffers. Economic conditions in New Haven were abysmal and despite its impressive pedigree, \"The Record\" sputtered along, self-destructed and was revived numerous times throughout this period, much like a Ford Pinto (coincidentally, Henry Ford II, CEO of Ford when the Pinto was released, served on \"The Record\"'s business staff in the late 1930s). Boards were convened and issues were published intermittently in 1971-1981, 1983, and 1987.\n\nThen in 1989, Yale students Michael Gerber and Jonathan Schwarz relaunched \"The Record\" for good. Their more informal, iconoclastic version of \"The Record\" proved popular, and a parody of the short-lived sports newspaper \"The National\" garnered national media attention. Gerber also created an ad hoc advisory board from \"Record\" alumni and friends, including Mark O'Donnell, Garry Trudeau, Robert Grossman, Harvey Kurtzman, Arnold Roth, Ian Frazier, Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, \"Record\" contributor Ryan Craig founded popular Yale tabloid the \"Rumpus\".\n\nWhile \"The Record\" continues to publish paper issues, the magazine began publishing web content on April 1, 2001, well before many of its contemporaries. \n\nAlums from recent years have gone on to write for many publications and entertainment companies including \"The New Yorker\", \"McSweeney's\", \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Onion\" and \"The Onion News Network\".\n\nEach issue of the current magazine features a particular theme. Aspects of the magazine include:\n\nFrom time to time, \"The Record\" publishes parodies. These include (but are not limited to):\n\n\nThroughout the year, the \"Record\" invites notable figures from the world of comedy to \"Master's Teas\", informal interviews hosted by the \"Record\" in conjunction with residential colleges, at which tea is, in fact, not even served upon request. While residential colleges frequently organize Master's Teas, \"The Yale Record\" is known for its humorous ones. Guests have included:\n\nFor over a century, the mascot of the \"Record\" has been \"Old Owl\", a congenial, largely nocturnal, 360-degree-head-turning, cigar-smoking bird who tries to steer the staff towards a light-hearted appreciation of life and the finer things in it. Sometimes he succeeds.\n\nRecently, the cigar that our fluffy feathered friend smokes has been deemed 'unsuitable' by the committee that governs Yale apparel. It is unclear when, if ever, this decision will be reversed.\n\n\"Old Owl\" is a Cutty Sark connoisseur of some repute and enthusiasm. In artists' sketches, he is often portrayed as anthropomorphic, naked and lacking in any identifiable genitals, possibly the result of an old Cutty Sark injury.\n\nAs a nod to this lovable old coot and his off-the-wall antics, former chairpeople, editors-in-chief, and publishers are referred to as \"old owls\".\n\n\"The Yale Record\" of the late nineteenth century chronicled much of the birth of American football:\n\nAccording to David Wilton, author of \"Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends\" (2009), \"The Yale Record\" is responsible for coining the term \"hot dog\":\n\nThere are many stories about the origin of the term hot dog, most of them are false. Let us start with what we know. The first known use of the term is in the \"Yale Record\" of October 19, 1895...The reason why they are called \"hot\" is obvious, but why \"dog\"? It is a reference to the alleged contents of the sausage. The association of sausages and dog meat goes back quite a bit further. The term \"dog\" has been used as a synonym for sausage since at least 1884...\nBladderball was a game traditionally played by students at Yale, between 1954 and 1982, after which it was banned by the administration.\n\nIt was created by Philip Zeidman as a competition between \"The Yale Record\", the \"Yale Daily News\", \"The Yale Banner\" and campus radio station WYBC. It was eventually opened to all students, with teams divided by residential college.\n\nNotable \"Yale Record\" alumni include (but are not limited to):\n\nGuest contributors to \"The Record\" have included:\n\n\n"}

Moreover, MEncoder can read a sequence of image files and convert it to a video file with a specified framerate. MPlayer can be used to view the output of most of the filters (or of a whole pipeline of filters) before running MEncoder. If the system is not able to process this in realtime, audio can be disabled using -nosound to allow a smooth review of the video filtering results.\n\nIt is possible to copy audio and/or video unmodified into the output file to avoid quality loss because of re-encoding. For example, to modify only the audio or only the video, or to put the audio/video data unmodified into a different container format.\n\nSince it uses the same code as MPlayer, it features the same huge number of highly-configurable video and audio filters to transform the video and audio stream. Filters include cropping, scaling, vertical flipping, horizontal mirroring, expanding to create letterboxes, rotating, brightness/contrast, changing the aspect ratio, colorspace conversion, hue/saturation, color-specific gamma correction, filters for reducing the visibility of compression artifacts caused by MPEG compression (deblocking, deringing), automatic brightness/contrast enhancement (autolevel), sharpness/blur, denoising filters, several ways of deinterlacing, and reversing telecine.\n\nChanging the frame rate is possible using the -ofps or -speed options and by using the framestep filter for skipping frames. Reducing the frame rate can be used to create fast-motion \"speed\" effects which are sometimes seen in films.\n\nDoubling the frame rate of interlaced footage without duplicating or morphing frames is possible using the tfields filter to create two different frames from each of the two fields in one frame of interlaced video. This allows playback on progressive displays, while preserving the full resolution and framerate of interlaced video, unlike other deinterlacing methods. It also makes the video stream usable for framerate conversion, and creating slow-motion scenes from streams taken at standard video/TV frame rates, e.g. using cheap consumer camcorders. If the filter gets incorrect information about the top/bottom field order, the resulting output will have juddering motion, because the two frames created would be displayed in the wrong order.\n\n\n"}

The term is used especially with reference to cervical mucus at the time just prior to or during ovulation, and to sputum, particularly in cases of cystic fibrosis.\n\nUnder the influence of estrogens, cervical mucus becomes abundant, clear, and stretchable, and somewhat like egg white. The stretchability of the mucus is described by its spinnbarkeit, from the German word for the \"ability to be spun\". Only such mucus appears to be able to be penetrated by sperm. After ovulation, the character of cervical mucus changes, and under the influence of progesterone it becomes thick, scant, and tacky. Sperm typically cannot penetrate it.\n\nSaliva does not always exhibit spinnbarkeit, but it can under certain circumstances. The thickness and spinnbarkeit of nasal mucus are factors in whether or not the nose seems to be blocked.\n\nMucociliary transport depends on the interaction of fibrous mucus with beating cilia.\n"}

It lies on the western border of the Woking Borough, with a small part of the village in Guildford Borough. As part of the 2016 boundary review Brookwood became part of the Heathlands ward which comprises Brookwood, Bridley, Hook Heath, Mayford, Sutton Green and Barnsbury and Wych Hill.\n\nThe village is known for the 500-acre Brookwood Cemetery, also called the London Necropolis. The village also gave its name to the former Victorian Brookwood Hospital, once the leading mental institution in Surrey. Since its closure in 1994, it has been redeveloped as housing.\n\nThe village borders Knaphill, on the other side of the main A322 road, which is home to Brookwood Manor. The village also borders the Basingstoke Canal which has a flight of locks there. The Army Training Centre, Pirbright is a short distance to the west, with the decommissioned Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut slightly further away to the west. The village is surrounded mainly by heathland such as Sheet's Heath, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Smarts Heath and Brookwood Heath.\n\nThe main road is Connaught Road, a long road containing mixed Victorian terraces, a variety of 1930's semi-detached and larger detached houses. Branching off are smaller cul-de-sacs with more modern houses, some which back onto the canal itself. Along the road, there is a primary school which was established in 1906.\n\nThe village has grown over the 150 or so years since the vast cemetery and station first set roots in this area. Many of London's dead were buried in Brookwood Cemetery during the Victorian era due to the over-population of the city at that time. The logistics were accomplished using the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of funeral trains running from London Waterloo railway station to Brookwood and subsequently down a small branch line into the cemetery grounds. This branch-line is now disused. The main station and nearby Brookwood Club private members bar are at least 100 years old.\n\nIt is possible that the village was founded in the Anglo-Saxon period, as the word Brook is derived from 'Brock'. 'Brock' being Old English for Badger, so in a literal sense the village of Brookwood translates to 'badger wood'. The badger can be seen on the village crest and on the school uniform.\n\nBrookwood railway station is on the South Western Main Line, with four trains per hour each way. The junction with the Alton Line is about further west. There is also a regular bus service to Guildford, Woking and Frimley.\n\nBrookwood has a football team, Brookwood and District Football Club. Formed in 2007, B & D FC currently play in the Surrey and Hants Border League Division 3. Last season 2009/10 they were winners of the Prince Albert Cup, beating Abbey Rangers 5-4 in the match at Surrey Sports Park.\n\nBrookwood is home to quite a number of youth organisations and clubs. Most of these meet at either the Memorial Hall, St Saviours Church or are based in the school.\n\nBrookwood Scout Group meets in the Memorial hall every week during term time and offers both boys and girls between the ages of six and fourteen with the opportunity to take part in a wide range of activities and adventure. The group is a member of the Scout Association and covers the youngest three age bands that the Association caters for (Beavers, Cubs and Scouts).\n\nGoldsworth Park Angling Club, established 2015, manages angling at Goldsworth Park Lake and Brookwood Ponds, under license with Woking Borough Council.\n\n\n"}

The group garnered little success during their brief original incarnation from 1972 to 1973, but when the individual members found success in their solo careers, interest in The Flatlanders was rekindled with the band reuniting several times since. An earlier incarnation of this band was known as The Double Mountain Fork Of The Brazos River Boys.\n\nIn 1972, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock, formed The Flatlanders with each contributing vocals, guitar, and songwriting skills. Other key musicians were Steve Wesson on autoharp and musical saw, Tony Pearson on mandolin and backup harmony, Tommy Hancock (no relation to Butch Hancock) on fiddle and Syl Rice on string bass.\n\nOne of the band's first appearances was at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 1972, where they were named one of the winners of the inaugural Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Singer/Songwriter Competition.\n\nThe band's first recording project was produced in 1972 by Shelby Singleton, the then-owner of Memphis, Tennessee's famed Sun Studios. A promotional single, Gilmore's \"Dallas\", was a commercial failure, and the planned album, \"All American Music\", was all but scrapped, being released only in a limited run on 8-track tape in order to fulfill contractual obligations. \n\nThe Flatlanders performed through 1973 before disbanding. By the end of the decade, however, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock had all found success as solo performers, and rumors of their earlier obscure collaboration began to circulate. In 1990, Rounder Records issued the 1972 sessions as \"More a Legend Than a Band\".\n\nThe three musicians continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances. In 1998 they contributed to the soundtrack of \"The Horse Whisperer\", and then in 2002 released their follow-up album, \"Now Again,\" on New West Records. In 2004 this was followed with \"Wheels of Fortune\", again on New West. In 2004, New West released \"Live '72\" a live recording of the then-unknown country band performing at the One Knite honky-tonk in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn 2009, The Flatlanders released the album, \"Hills & Valleys\".

{"id": "1980807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980807", "title": "Boogie", "text": "Boogie\n\nBoogie is a repetitive, swung note or shuffle rhythm, \"groove\" or pattern used in blues which was originally played on the piano in boogie-woogie music. The characteristic rhythm and feel of the boogie was then adapted to guitar, double bass, and other instruments. The earliest recorded boogie-woogie song was in 1916. By the 1930s, Swing bands such as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Jordan all had boogie hits. By the 1950s, boogie became incorporated into the emerging rockabilly and rock and roll styles. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s country bands released country boogies. Today, the term \"boogie\" usually refers to dancing to pop, disco, or rock music.\n\nThe boogie was originally played on the piano in boogie-woogie music and adapted to guitar. Boogie-woogie is a style of blues piano playing characterized by an up-tempo rhythm, a repeated melodic pattern in the bass, and a series of improvised variations in the treble. Boogie woogie developed from a piano style that developed in the rough barrelhouse bars in the Southern states, where a piano player performed for the hard-drinking patrons. Wayne Schmidt remarks that with boogie-woogie songs, the \"bass line isn't just a time keeper or 'fill' for the right hand\"; instead, the bassline has equal importance to the right hand's melodic line. He argues that many boogie-woogie basslines use a \"rising/falling sequence of notes\" called walking bass line.\n\nThe origin of the term \"boogie-woogie\" is unknown, according to \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the word is a redoubling of \"boogie\", which was used for rent parties as early as 1913. The term may be derived from Black West African English, from the Sierra Leone term \"bogi\", which means \"to dance\"; as well, it may be akin to the phrase \"hausa buga\", which means \"to beat drums.\" In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the term \"could mean anything from a racy style of dance to a raucous party or to a sexually transmitted disease.\" In Peter Silvester's book on boogie woogie, \"Left Hand Like God — the Story of Boogie Woogie\" he states that, in 1929, “boogie-woogie is used to mean either dancing or music in the city of Detroit.”\n\nSchmidt claims that the \"earliest record of boogie woogie was Texan pianist George W. Thomas' release of \"New Orleans Hop Scop Blues\" as sheet music in 1916.\" Boogie hit the charts with Pine Top Smith's \"Pine Top's Boogie\" in 1929, which garnered the number 20 spot. In the late 1930s, boogie became part of the then popular Swing style, as big bands such as \"Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Louis Jordan...all had boogie hits.\" Swing big band audiences expected to hear boogie tunes, because the beat could be used for the then-popular dances such as the jitterbug and the Lindy Hop. As well, country artists began playing boogie woogie in the late 1930s, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".\nThe Delmore Brothers \"Freight Train Boogie\" shows how country music and blues were being blended to form the genre which would become known as rockabilly. The Sun Records-era rockabilly sound used \"wild country boogie piano\" as part of its sound.\n\nHowever, by the early 1950s, boogie became less popular, and by the mid-1950s, its related form, rock & roll, became the most popular style. By the mid-1970s, the meaning of the term returned to its roots, in a certain sense, as during the disco era, \"to boogie\" meant \"to dance in a disco style\" with one hit song in particular sung by the Euro disco group Silver Convention, \"Get Up and Boogie\". In the 1980s, country bands such as The Charlie Daniels Band used boogie woogie in songs such as the 1988 \"Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues\". In 1991 Brooks & Dunn released \"Boot Scootin' Boogie\". \n\nThe boogie groove is often used in rock and roll and country music. A simple rhythm guitar or accompaniment boogie pattern, sometimes called country boogie, is as follows:\n\nThe \"B\" and \"C\" notes are played by stretching the fourth finger from the \"A\" two and three frets up to \"B\" and \"C\" respectively on the same string. This pattern is an elaboration or decoration of the chord or level and is the same on all the primary triads (I, IV, V), although the dominant, or any chord, may include the seventh on the third beat (see also, degree (music)).\n\nA simple lead guitar boogie pattern is as follows:\n\nBoogie patterns are played with a swing or shuffle rhythm and generally follow the \"one finger per fret\" rule, where, as in the case directly above, if the third finger always covers the notes on the third fret, the second finger going only on the second fret, etc.\n\nThe swung notes or shuffle note are a rhythmic device in which the duration of the initial note in a pair is augmented and that of the second is diminished. Also known as \"notes inégales\", swung notes are widely used in jazz music and other jazz-influenced music such as blues and Western swing. A swing or shuffle rhythm is the rhythm produced by playing repeated pairs of notes in this way.\n\n"}

For his constant concern and tenacity in their efforts, and because he offered some of his lands and also economic concessions to the founding of the town Don Narciso de Justa is considered the founder of Caibarién. On 1834 it was named Colonia de Vives, but in 1837 the original name (\"Caibarién\") was restored. On September 19, 1873 it was awarded the title village.\n\nIn 1878 the town already had stores, churches, schools and newspapers.

This year the mayor Cosío died and Damián Judez Celaya was elected. On January 18, 1895 Judez died and was succeeded by the Spanish merchant Antonio Imaz Llaguno.\n\nBefore the independence war of 1895 the village had achieved steady progress, showing an economic power that was a real surprise at the time.\n\nThe area was the scene of actions during the independence wars of the nineteenth century like the uprising of Carlos Roloff.\n\nThe city is situated on the north coast of Cuba, bordering the Bay of Buena Vista (Bahía de Buena Vista) of the Atlantic Ocean. It lies at the eastern extremity of the Villa Clara Province, close to the border with Sancti Spíritus Province. The town is served by the Caibarién Airport .\n\nThe municipality is divided into the barrios of Primero, Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto and Quinto.\n\nCayo Conuco is a tiny island located from Caibarién, which is joined to the mainland by a stone causeway. It was recently covered only by thin, dry pasture, however native plant species have resumed their original place. In 1948, the Asociación de Scouts de Cuba held its second national Jamboree in Cayo Conuco.\n\nCaibarién once served as a shipping point for agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, tobacco, and fruit. It also served as a sponge-fishing center. Its hotels are now destroyed by lack of care, and most concrete houses are crumbling onto its streets. The piers that once served as shipping points for agricultural commodities have fallen into the bay. The two sugar mills that used to send their sugar exports through the harbor are now closed and crumbling. The major sugar mill (Reforma) is now a museum for tourists.\n\nThe Parrandas carnivals take place twice a year in August–September and mid-December. They last usually for about two weeks at a time.\n\nThe main center for tourists in Caibarién is \"Los Cayos\" (The keys) with such cays as Cayo Santa María, Cayo Fragoso, Cayo Las Brujas, etc. New Cuban reforms now allow Cuban citizens to enter the resorts and beaches that were once exclusive to tourists.\n\nIn 2004, the municipality of Caibarién had a population of 38,064.

An essential part of the spit-take is comedic timing. The person performing the spit-take usually starts drinking right before the punchline is delivered.\n\nIn performance, a spit-take represents a reaction of shock, while in real life it is typically one of mirth.\n\n\"Spit take\" was included in the \"Oxford Dictionary\" (not to be confused with the \"Oxford English Dictionary\") in a 2014 update. It was also added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in an April 2019 update.\n\nTwo characters sit at a table. Character #1 has a cup of coffee in hand.\n\nCharacter 1: Did they ever find that missing toxic sludge?\nCharacter 2: Yes...\nCharacter 2: Someone poured it into the coffee urn.\n\nIn a spit-take, the reaction is usually one of surprise. In the above example, Character 1 intentionally spits the coffee upon learning what's inside; however, a spit-take can also be done unintentionally, in response to a surprising statement unrelated to the drink itself. The \"spit\" action is overly dramatized; performers will add lots of noise and spray liquid from their mouth in an exaggerated fashion.\n\nAlbert Brooks' short film, \"The Famous Comedians School\", features a workshop on spit takes.\n\nUsage\n\nThe spit-take, as a comedic technique, is a noun, but it shows up in media in some different forms. It can be seen used figuratively in a description of a satire work: \"\" \"(it) is a spit-take on the world of contemporary pop music and celebrity...\"\n\nIt can also be used as a verb: \"On the morning of May 12, LinkedIn … emailed scores of my contacts and told them I’m a professional racist. It was one of those updates that LinkedIn regularly sends its users, algorithmically assembled missives about their connections’ appearances in the media…. This surely caused a few of my professional acquaintances to spit-take. — Will Johnson, \"Slate\", 24 May 2016.\"\n\nThe conjugation of spit-take as a verb is not clearly defined. There is evidence of both \"spit-taked\" and \"spit took.\" Constructions like \"made me spit-take\" are convenient for avoiding this issue all together. Beyond that, leaving the phrase as a noun, like \"do a spit-take,\" continues to be the most common usage.\n\nOriginally called a spit gag, the word itself most likely dates to the early 20th century, but it mostly existed in showbiz vernacular.\n\nDanny Thomas, commonly associated with the spit-take, is credited as the comedian who made it famous. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Danny Thomas spit take.\" He perfected it during the 11 seasons of \"The Danny Thomas Show\" (1953-1964). However, Ricky Ricardo did it a year earlier in an \"I Love Lucy\" (1951-1957) episode. It has been used in several sitcoms since\n\nThe \"spit\" part of the term is clear, but the \"take\" part is a little less obvious. In this context, the word \"take\" is used in the sense of a visible response or reaction (as to something unexpected). It is similar in construction to the phrase \"double-take\".\n"}

The French Foreign Legion scenario was remade as \"The Flying Deuces\" with Charles B. Middleton again playing their commanding officer.\n\nStan and Ollie are at home while a lovesick Ollie sings and plays piano for his absent sweetheart Jeanie-Weenie (only ever seen as a photograph), before revealing to Stan that he is to marry her. The postman delivers a letter from Jeanie-Weenie rejecting Ollie for another. A heartbroken Ollie announces that the pair of them shall be joining the French Foreign Legion, as it is the only place where he can forget her. When they arrive at the barracks in French Algeria, they discover that not only are all the other soldiers also trying to forget lost loves, they are all trying to forget the same lost love as Ollie and one another: Jeanie-Weenie!\n\nAn attempt by the pair to leave the Legion is angrily rejected by the camp commander and the entire platoon is sent on a forced march. A scout enters the camp in a hurry to say that Legion fortress Fort Arid is to be besieged by native Riffian tribesmen, and the garrison is sent to defend it. The duo get cut off from the rest of the regiment in a sandstorm but reach the fortress before the others. Surprisingly, with the aid of barrels of nails, the boys defeat the Riffians by themselves and the leader of the Riffians is revealed to be yet another of Jeanie-Weenie's conquests.\n\nIn January 1992, seven days after Hal Roach celebrated his hundredth birthday, the centenarian appeared as a guest on \"The Tonight Show\". On that occasion, Jay Leno was subbing for host Johnny Carson. When Leno asked Roach which of the movies he had made was his favorite, he selected \"Beau Hunks\". Roach said it was strictly because \"leading lady\" Jean Harlow—who had started at Roach's studio but had moved on to become a star at MGM—appeared in \"Beau Hunks\" for nothing. Harlow \"appeared\" in the film only through old publicity photographs for the Roach studio.\n\nA Dutch musical ensemble, named The Beau Hunks Orchestra after that film, was formed in early 1992 for the purpose of performing some of the soundtrack music at an Oliver Hardy centennial celebration in Amsterdam. They went on to release a number of recordings of the film music of Leroy Shield and some other composers, notably Raymond Scott.\n\n"}

It was used by future queens consort up until the end of the 18th century.\n\nOriginally set with hired diamonds, the crown is set with crystals for display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.\n\nMary also had a diadem, also in the Jewel House, and a coronation crown, now owned by the Museum of London.\n\nThe gold crown originally had 523 small diamonds, 38 large diamonds, and 129 large pearls. These have been replaced with quartz crystals. It is tall and weighs . The crown is decorated with crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis and has four half-arches, surmounted with a monde and cross pattée.\n\nTraditionally, when a king is married, his wife is crowned as queen consort at their coronation ceremony. In 1649, the monarchy was abolished after a long civil war between Charles I and his Parliament, and the Crown Jewels were either sold or turned into coins by the Mint. In 1685, Mary of Modena, wife of James II and VII, was the first queen consort to be crowned after the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II having been unmarried when he took the throne in 1660.\n\nThree pieces of headgear were made for the queen: a diadem to wear in procession to Westminster Abbey, a coronation crown for the crowning, and a state crown to wear upon leaving the Abbey. Made by Richard de Beauvoir, it was covered in diamonds valued at £35,000, and the bill for hiring them was £1,000. She paid for the crowns out of her own pocket and also commissioned two new sceptres and a coronation ring for the ceremony.\n\nMary's diadem was set with 177 diamonds, 78 pearls, 1 sapphire, 1 emerald, and 1 ruby; it now contains artificial gemstones and cultured pearls, and is also on display at the Tower of London. It is tall and weighs .\n\nHer empty coronation crown was acquired from a private dealer by the Museum of London in 1956. It had been sent to the Crown Jewellers, Rundell & Bridge, for maintenance work in the 19th century, but was never returned to the Royal family. Originally, the crown weighed and was set with 419 diamonds, 46 large pearls, 7 rubies, 7 sapphires, and 2 emeralds.\n\nIt was subsequently used by Mary of Modena's stepdaughters Mary II and Queen Anne, and also by George I; Queen Caroline, wife of George II; and Queen Charlotte, wife of George III. In 1831, the crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, and it was replaced with the Crown of Queen Adelaide for her coronation alongside her husband, William IV. However, it is possible that Adelaide was crowned using one of Mary of Modena's crowns.\n\n\n"}

It is a hand made needlework created by weaving or embroidery using a long blunt needle and a thread on a ground of knotted net lace or Filet Work made of square or diagonal meshes of the same sizes or of different sizes. \nLacis uses the same technique but is made on a ground of Leno (a woven fabric) or small canvas (not a knotted lace).\n\nFilet lace is a form of decorative netting and as such can be presumed to have derived at some point from the fishnet that a community would require for fishing, hunting, transporting, etc. and not necessarily because they were living close to the water. \n\nLatin word filatorium place for spinning, from filare to spin, from Latin filum a thread. Ref: Wiktionary, the latin word Filatory)\nThe Latin word \"filatorium\" is being used to describe Filet lace then Jourdain (1904) quotes a reference to Exeter Cathedral possessing four pieces of Filet lace in 1327. Ingram (1922) states that there was a \"cushion of net-work in St. Paul's Cathedral so early as 1295.\" Such work, in the 14th century, was also described as \"opus araneum\".\n\nFilet-work is the result of knotting a fabric of diagonal or square meshes to create an open fabric called Lace. The tool to make a Knotted Net Lace is a Shuttle-Needle and a Gauge stick for measure of the meshes.\n\nThe book Renaissance Patterns for Lace, Embroidery and Needlepoint, an unabridged facsimile of the \"Singuliers et nouveaux pourtraicts\" of 1587 by Federico de Vinciolo contains approximately 50 beautiful and well designed patterns which are suitable for Filet lace-Embroidery on Knotted Net using the Linen Stitch.\n\nAs mentioned above, filet lace is created by doing embroidery stitches on a knotted net lace. The knotted ground lace can either be made by the lacemaker or as of 2003 purchased commercially in either handmade or machine-made varieties (available at Filet Lace by the Sea).\n\nMaking the net by hand with a shuttle needle and a gauge involves anchoring the piece, using either a heavy cushion (which Carità (1909) recommends be made of lead but should be replaced by sand or a C clip), a chair or a stirrup around the worker’s foot. Having a secure anchor against which to maintain tension, a square net is made starting from one corner and adding a new mesh on each row until the desired size is reached, then by decreasing. The individual meshes are formed on a gauge which helps ensure a uniform size and are created by knotting to a loop in the previous round: square mesh, diagonal mesh, circular, free form.\nBy using a very fine thread and different sizes of gauge you will create a beautiful and delicate lace work.\n\nThe Knotted Lace is then stretched on a frame and embroidery stitches are added using a long blunt needle and a thread. Patterns are designed on a grid with a mark for the meshes to be filled with the thread. A path (or direction) is traced on this pattern and then you follow this path with the needle on the ground lace. \nWhen a group of certain stitches are used, the technique takes a name: Filet Guipure, Filet Richelieu, Filet Soutache\", \"Linen Stitch (Point de Toile), Darning Stitch (Point de Reprise); And then, when a region recognize it, it becomes French Filet, Filet di Bosa, Filet Italien, Filet de Gruyère, Russian Filet Guipure, etc. \n\nMany designs involve weaving the main design in linen stitch, indeed some designs consist entirely of linen stitch. This creates solid and open areas on the piece. A geometrical design or a sampler can use several different stitches, when a figural design will use very few stitches or only the linen stitch. \n\nFilet lace is often seen in a single color of thread, usually white or ecru, but countries all over the world have used colored thread, precious metal threads, wool, feathers, etc.\n\n\n"}

As a teenager, she overcame a degenerative hip condition that made walking extremely difficult, and organized fan clubs for popular singers she admired, such as Eddie Fisher and Steve Lawrence. She became a gossip columnist for the Bell-McClure newspaper syndicate in 1957, and soon went to work for the management handling teen idols Frankie Avalon and Fabian.\n\nIn 1966, she began broadcasting Hollywood gossip on the Los Angeles television station KABC-TV. She appeared on TV regularly, going on to appear on ABC's five owned and operated stations around the country. WABC-TV in New York put her pre-recorded gossip segment into its nightly local news, but anchor Roger Grimsby would generally introduce it by making disparaging comments about her. Barrett made Frank Sinatra's enemies list by criticizing his personal life, particularly his relationships with his children. Barrett also angered actor Ryan O'Neal after she wrote some unflattering things about him. To retaliate, he supposedly sent her a box containing a live tarantula. She developed the first in-depth personal TV specials about film, television, music, sports and political celebrities, and she had a series of magazines on the entertainment industry that were top-rated at newsstands, including \"Rona Barrett's Hollywood: Nothing But the Truth\", published by Laufer Media. She also appeared on \"Jack Paar Tonite\" with Clement Freud.\n\nBarrett began appearing on \"Good Morning America\" in 1975. In 1980, she was signed to co-host NBC's \"Tomorrow\" with Tom Snyder, but a very public feud with Snyder resulted in her leaving the show the following year.\n\nBarrett also made occasional film appearances, playing cameo roles in \"The Phynx\" (1970) and the Mae West film \"Sextette\" (1978). In 1990, she made a guest appearance as an interviewer at WWF's WrestleMania VI at Skydome (now Rogers Centre) in Toronto. In 1991, she retired full-time to her ranch.\n\nIn 1972, her novel titled \"The Lovo-maniacs\" was published. Her autobiography, \"Miss Rona\", was published in 1974. It began: \"Just an inch, Miss Rona, just let me put it in an inch!\", as an unnamed famous actor pleaded to be allowed to experience a modicum of sexual intercourse with her. In the book she also acknowledged having a nose job and discussed details of her teenage fan club involvements and her work with Frankie Avalon's management. She wrote another book, \"How You Can Look Rich and Achieve Sexual Ecstasy\" (1978).\n\nIn 2009, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.\n\nBarrett founded the Rona Barrett Lavender Company, in Santa Ynez, near Santa Barbara, in the Central Coast region of California, as a small producer of lavender bath, beauty, food and aromatherapy products. The company follows a model of using celebrity-branded consumer goods to generate funds and raise awareness of a non-profit cause. A portion of all company proceeds were donated to the Rona Barrett Foundation. According to the foundation's website, they have ceased selling lavender products and the company has been sold.\n\nBarrett started The Rona Barrett Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the aid and support of senior citizens in need, that was supported by a 2% portion of the profits from her lavender business until it ceased production.

These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizontal line.\n\nThe term is generally applied to any item used to mark a point as an elevation reference. Frequently, bronze or aluminum disks are set in stone or concrete, or on rods driven deeply into the earth to provide a stable elevation point. If an elevation is marked on a map, but there is no physical mark on the ground, it is a spot height.\n\nThe height of a benchmark is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending from a \"fundamental benchmark\". A fundamental benchmark is a point with a precisely known relationship to the vertical datum of the area, typically mean sea level. The position and height of each benchmark is shown on large-scale maps.\n\nThe terms \"height\" and \"elevation\" are often used interchangeably, but in many jurisdictions they have specific meanings; \"height\" commonly refers to a local or relative difference in the vertical (such as the height of a building), whereas \"elevation\" refers to the difference from a nominated reference surface (such as sea-level, or a mathematical/geodetic model that approximates the sea level known as the geoid). Elevation may be specified as normal height (above a reference ellipsoid), orthometric height, or dynamic height which have slightly different definitions.\n\nTriangulation points, also known as trig points, are marks with a precisely established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as the tip of a church spire or a chimney stack are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the United Kingdom triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as \"fixed in three dimensions\".\n\nBenchmarks are typically placed (\"monumented\") by a government agency or private survey firm, and many governments maintain a register of these marks so that the records are available to all. These records are usually in the form of a geographically searchable database (computer or map-based), with links to sketches, diagrams, photos of the marks, and any other technical details.\n\nGovernment agencies that place and maintain records of benchmarks include:\n\n\n"}

Software benchmarks are, for example, run against compilers or database management systems (DBMS).\n\nBenchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different chip/system architectures.\n\nTest suites are a type of system intended to assess the correctness of software.\n\nAs computer architecture advanced, it became more difficult to compare the performance of various computer systems simply by looking at their specifications. Therefore, tests were developed that allowed comparison of different architectures. For example, Pentium 4 processors generally operated at a higher clock frequency than Athlon XP or PowerPC processors, which did not necessarily translate to more computational power; a processor with a slower clock frequency might perform as well as or even better than a processor operating at a higher frequency. See BogoMips and the megahertz myth.\n\nBenchmarks are designed to mimic a particular type of workload on a component or system. Synthetic benchmarks do this by specially created programs that impose the workload on the component. Application benchmarks run real-world programs on the system. While application benchmarks usually give a much better measure of real-world performance on a given system, synthetic benchmarks are useful for testing individual components, like a hard disk or networking device.\n\nBenchmarks are particularly important in CPU design, giving processor architects the ability to measure and make tradeoffs in microarchitectural decisions. For example, if a benchmark extracts the key algorithms of an application, it will contain the performance-sensitive aspects of that application. Running this much smaller snippet on a cycle-accurate simulator can give clues on how to improve performance.\n\nPrior to 2000, computer and microprocessor architects used SPEC to do this, although SPEC's Unix-based benchmarks were quite lengthy and thus unwieldy to use intact.\n\nComputer manufacturers are known to configure their systems to give unrealistically high performance on benchmark tests that are not replicated in real usage. For instance, during the 1980s some compilers could detect a specific mathematical operation used in a well-known floating-point benchmark and replace the operation with a faster mathematically equivalent operation. However, such a transformation was rarely useful outside the benchmark until the mid-1990s, when RISC and VLIW architectures emphasized the importance of compiler technology as it related to performance. Benchmarks are now regularly used by compiler companies to improve not only their own benchmark scores, but real application performance.\n\nCPUs that have many execution units — such as a superscalar CPU, a VLIW CPU, or a reconfigurable computing CPU — typically have slower clock rates than a sequential CPU with one or two execution units when built from transistors that are just as fast. Nevertheless, CPUs with many execution units often complete real-world and benchmark tasks in less time than the supposedly faster high-clock-rate CPU.\n\nGiven the large number of benchmarks available, a manufacturer can usually find at least one benchmark that shows its system will outperform another system; the other systems can be shown to excel with a different benchmark.\n\nManufacturers commonly report only those benchmarks (or aspects of benchmarks) that show their products in the best light. They also have been known to mis-represent the significance of benchmarks, again to show their products in the best possible light. Taken together, these practices are called \"bench-marketing.\"\n\nIdeally benchmarks should only substitute for real applications if the application is unavailable, or too difficult or costly to port to a specific processor or computer system. If performance is critical, the only benchmark that matters is the target environment's application suite.\n\nBenchmarking is not easy and often involves several iterative rounds in order to arrive at predictable, useful conclusions. Interpretation of benchmarking data is also extraordinarily difficult. Here is a partial list of common challenges:\n\n\nThere are seven vital characteristics for benchmarks. These key properties are:\n[1] Relevance: Benchmarks should measure relatively vital features.\n[2] Representativeness: Benchmark performance metrics should be broadly accepted by industry and academia.\n[3] Equity: All systems should be fairly compared.\n[4] Repeatability: Benchmark results can be verified.\n[5] Cost-effectiveness: Benchmark tests are economical.\n[6] Scalability: Benchmark tests should measure from single server to multiple servers.\n[7] Transparency: Benchmark metrics should be easy to understand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fair Haven Heights is not to be confused with the adjacent Fair Haven neighborhood west of the river. The area is bordered on the west by the Quinnipiac River, on the north by Route 80, on the east by the town of East Haven, and on the south by Ferry Street and Warwick Avenue. The main through routes are Quinnipiac Avenue, East Grand Avenue, and Eastern Street\n\nIt was founded in the 18th century as a fishing and oystering village called Dragon. Dragon was initially located at the point where the present day Ferry Street Bridge crosses the Quinnipiac River. Early Native American settlements existed in the same location. According to some, the name Dragon originated with stories told by suitors of seals (sea dragons) that would sun themselves on this sandy point of land. According to others, it was called Dragon by the early white settlers because the Native American word for those harbor seals sounded like \"dragon\" to their ear.\n\nFrom the time of the Quinnipiac (in their language, “long-water-land”) Indians, the oyster was not only an available food source but a major industry of the community, which was to influence the prosperity of the neighborhood during the 19th century.\n\nDragon in time came to include the eastern side of the river that belonged to East Haven, and came to be known as the Heights (because the bulk of that area is set on a huge, heavily wooded hill). Together both the neighborhood across the River (called Neck at the time) and Dragon became Fair Haven in the 19th century (1824). In 1870 the Neck became part of New Haven. It was not until 1881 that the Heights incorporated with New Haven, after an affiliation with the town of East Haven.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, a number of brownstone quarries existed along Russell Street in the Heights. This rocky, wooded area behind the Friends Meeting House is now part of Quarry Park.\n\nToday, it is a demographically mixed neighborhood. There are luxury condominiums along the Quinnipiac, modest small homes along Grand Avenue, and public housing projects at the summit of the hill. Similarly, the ethnic breakdown of residents includes Italian-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and African-Americans.\n\nThere are two large, colonial-era churches on Grand Avenue between Lenox and Quinnipiac. One is shared by an Episcopalian Congregation (St. James Episcopal Church) and an Independent Catholic Parish (St. Joseph of Arimathea Independent Catholic Church), and the other is Congregational. In addition, the New Haven Religious Society of Friends relocated their Quaker Meeting House to Grand Avenue in the 1990s.\n\nThanks to improving water quality, oystering has returned to the Quinnipiac River since the 1990s.\n\nFair Haven Heights is in State Senate District 11, State Assembly District 97, and Aldermanic Ward 13. It is currently represented by Senator Martin Looney, Representative Bob Megna, and Alderman Brenda Barnes, all Democrats.\n\nOriginally, the Heights was generally fields and woods. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this area saw the construction of many homes in the Victorian Gothic style. Spacious homes were built by successful businessmen high above the river on East Grand Avenue, Clifton Street, Sherland Avenue, Lenox Street and Quinnipiac Avenue.\n\nJames F. Babcock, a lawyer and publisher of the New Haven Palladium newspaper, built a large Victorian Gothic home on of land between East Grand Avenue and Clifton Street. The present day address is 89 Sherland Avenue. A few years later the house, two barns and a carriage house were sold. The Babcock home was altered and two more homes were built. Arched woodwork decorates the eaves and high gables. On the southern part of what was the Babcock estate at 154 East Grand Avenue can be found the Victorian Gothic home of the Moody family. Lucius Moody was a successful insurance agent. His wife, Dr. Mary Blair Moody, was the first woman physician in the area. Sharp gables, porches and bays, and decorative woodwork complete this example of wooden Victorian Gothic. Two Victorian Gothic cottages remain at 106 and 112 Sherland Avenue.\n\nThe Charles Ives home originally was built on Clifton Street on land that is now Fairmont Park. The Ives redstone walls and gates remain. Charles Ives, a lawyer (not to be confused with the composer, Charles Edward Ives), was a member of the Connecticut General Assembly and Speaker of the House in the mid-19th century. The Ives’ Victorian Gothic home was designed by Rufus Russell. In the early 1920s the Ives’ property was purchased by the City of New Haven to become Fairmont Park. The Ives’ home was moved across the street, and made into two two-family homes (151-153 and 159-161 Clifton Street). Further down Clifton Street at 80 and 84 stand two Greek Revival homes on high cellars.\n\nThe Henry Lancraft house was built on Lenox Street in the Victorian Gothic style. The Lancraft brothers were builders and oystermen in the late 19th century. A redstone wall remains on the property with an entrance at 120 Lexington Avenue.\n\nComing down the hill to 61 East Grand Avenue one finds the Foote-Chamberlain house. Built in the 1830s in the Italian Villa style it sits above a stone wall topped by an iron fence. In the late 19th century the house was renovated with the addition of a veranda, two ells, a balustraded roof and scalloped shingles.\n\nAll along Quinnipiac Avenue one can find homes that were built by families in the oyster business, banking and provisions. The Barnes Victorian Gothic home can be found at 1212 Quinnipiac Avenue. Henry Barnes and his neighbor Horace H. Strong along with Franklin H. Hart were wholesale dealers in meat, seafood and vegetables. At 965 Quinnipiac Avenue stands a home built by Willet Hemingway. Descendants of the family continued to live in the home for years after it was built in the late 1840s. At the turn of the 20th century changes were made in the house that altered it to the Victorian Carpenter Gothic style. In 2002 the now 3 family home was purchased by Doug and Cheri Forbush who continue to occupy and maintain it. The bright pink house, located at the corner of Hemingway Street and Quinnipiac Avenue, serves as a useful landmark while driving or walking through this historic neighborhood.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1980899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980899", "title": "Kat Slater", "text": "Kat Slater\n\nKathleen \"Kat\" Slater (also Moon) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", played by Jessie Wallace. She is also played by Kate Peck in a flashback in 2001 and Sumar-Elise Sandford in a flashback in 2018. Kat is the second eldest Slater family sister and first appears on 18 September 2000. Kat's usual dress is very short skirts and leopard-print tops, with much make-up and heavy fake tan. She would often go on all-night binges and has slept with many men, but calmed down in more recent years. As such, she can be described as a tart with a heart character. The \"EastEnders\" website says that as soon as Kat arrived in Walford with her \"fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings\", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of \"Viagra to the men of Albert Square\". Wallace did not appear in the show between November 2004 and May 2005 following a period of maternity leave, and Kat later left the soap on 25 December 2005. Wallace reprised the role in 2010 and Kat returned on 17 September, initially signing a one-year contract. She took leave from the soap again between January and June 2012. The character departed the soap again in May 2015, returning briefly between December 2015 and January 2016. Wallace reprises her role as Kat in the six-part spin-off series \"\" in 2017. Following the confirmation that \"Kat & Alfie: Redwater\" would not return for a second series, it was announced that Kat would return to \"EastEnders\"; she returned on 22 March 2018. On 26 January 2020, Wallace was suspended from the soap for two months due to her off-screen behaviour. Kat departed on 23 March 2020.\n\nThe character has been involved in many storylines, most significantly in a plot twist which sees her sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan), revealed to be her daughter after she was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) as a child. Another key aspect to the character's storylines is her marriage to Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), prior to which she became briefly engaged to Alfie's love rival Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); after Kat jilted Andy on their wedding day, he blackmailed her into sleeping with him in his revenge bid against Alfie and Kat. In the events of Kat's second stint on the soap, in what was called \"the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps\", Kat and Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James Branning, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy Moon, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about \"EastEnders\" storyline. Kat's storylines also include suffering a miscarriage, an affair with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) which briefly ends her marriage with Alfie, becoming penniless and permanently scarred in a fire and becoming a millionaire. In 2015 Kat's most prominent storyline - the character's rape, is revisited when it is revealed that Kat had given birth to twins and she has a secret son, Zoe's twin brother and this facilitates the characters second exit from the soap. In \"Kat & Alfie: Redwater\", Kat discovers her son is a murderous Catholic priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack).\n\nIn her third stint on the soap, Kat's storylines have focused on the breakdown of her and Alfie's marriage and her separation from her children, a relationship with Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), feuds with both her cousin Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), which leads to the latter suffering from an injury caused by Stacey, and supporting her friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) with her stalker Leo King (Tom Wells). \n\nWallace has won multiple awards for her portrayal of Kat. At the National Television Awards, she was named \"Most Popular Newcomer\" in 2001 and \"Most Popular Actress\" in 2003. Wallace was additionally nominated for the \"Best Actress\", \"Best Dramatic Performance\" and \"Hero of the Year\" awards in 2002, and Zoe's maternity was nominated \"Best Storyline\". She was again nominated \"Best Actress\" from 2003 to 2006 consecutively, and shared \"Best On-Screen Partnership\" and \"Best Exit\" nominations with Richie in 2004 and 2006 respectively. In February 2011, following Kat's return to \"EastEnders\", Wallace was nominated for Best Actress at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards for her portrayal of Kat, and was also nominated alongside Richie for Best Comeback. She won the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Award for \"TV Soap Personality\" in March 2011.\n\nKat arrives in Walford on 18 September 2000, along with her family: father Charlie (Derek Martin), sisters Lynne (Elaine Lordan), Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) and Zoe (Michelle Ryan), and grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Kat embarks on a brief fling with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), much to the annoyance of his girlfriend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). She finds work in The Queen Victoria public house as a barmaid, where she is an instant hit with the customers. Fiercely defensive of her sisters, Kat embarks on a feud with Little Mo's abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns) - though has a fling with Lynne's boyfriend Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves). Much to Zoe's frustration, Kat is often over-protective of her. When Zoe announces her decision move to Spain with their uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), Kat refuses to allow her to go. She reveals that she is Zoe's mother, having been sexually abused by Harry aged thirteen. Zoe flees Walford, and Kat attempts suicide by cutting her wrists. She recovers, is romanced by local doctor Anthony Trueman (Nicholas R. Bailey), and later finds Zoe and brings her home. Their relationship improves, but after Kat breaks up with Anthony, he and Zoe begin an affair. Zoe disowns Kat for disapproving of their relationship, and later runs away when Anthony reveals that he is still in love with Kat.\n\nAnthony and Kat's relationship resumes, but she fails to impress his colleagues and breaks up with him as he is about to propose. Kat discovers she is pregnant by him and decides to have an abortion. Her boss Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) persuades her not to, but she suffers a miscarriage shortly after telling Anthony of the pregnancy. Alfie comforts her and realises that he is in love with her. Kat soon begins a relationship with local crime kingpin Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), and they end up getting engaged. However, Kat confesses to Alfie's grandmother Nana (Hilda Braid) that she loves Alfie - who upon discovering this intervenes; he stops Kat and Andy's wedding and confesses his love for her. Kat leaves Andy, and she and Alfie marry on Christmas Day. Alfie later borrows money from Andy which he is unable to repay, so Andy threatens to kill him unless Kat has sex with him. A reluctant Kat does so, but unbeknownst to her Andy films the liaison and sends it to Alfie. Alfie becomes cold and distant and Kat resorts to alcoholism. After a one-night stand with a stranger, Roger (Russell Boulter), a disgusted Kat leaves Walford.\n\nSeveral months later, Kat's grandmother Mo discovers that she is in prison for prostitution. Upon her release, Mo convinces her to return to Walford. Kat is determined to win Alfie back, but he is now in a relationship with Little Mo. Though he opts to reconcile with Kat, she is unwilling once she learns of his relationship with her sister. Kat rebuilds her relationship with Zoe, and they part on good terms when Zoe leaves to work as a holiday rep in Ibiza. Before Zoe leaves, Kat discovers that Zoe was involved in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), and tells Kat that she had been lead to believe that she had killed Den until Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) had told her the truth about Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) being the murderer. Kat confronts Sam about letting Zoe believe that she had killed Den and threatens Chrissie to not let Zoe's involvement become known to the police. Chrissie agrees, but in return, asks for an alibi. Kat's cousin Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) agrees to become Chrissie's alibi, but Chrissie is later caught out and arrested for Den's murder. When Nana Moon dies, Kat comforts Alfie and their feelings for one another once more become apparent. On Christmas Day 2005, they confess their love and depart Walford to travel across the United States.\n\nKat returns to Walford in September 2010, fleeing from a man she and Alfie conned for money. Alfie arrives but Kat is displeased to see him. She reveals to her family that while Alfie was serving time in prison, she had an affair with another man, who proves to be Alfie's cousin Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) and is now pregnant with Michael's child. In an attempt to prove himself responsible, Alfie leases The Queen Victoria public house. He struggles to raise the rent, and enters into a partnership with Michael, unaware that Michael is the father of Kat's baby. After an argument with Alfie, Kat agrees to move to Spain with Michael, but ultimately changes her mind and reconciles with her husband.\n\nKat gives birth to Tommy, and is rushed to hospital the next day due to complications. While she and Alfie are absent, James, the newborn son of local resident Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack), dies of sudden infant death syndrome. Ronnie swaps the babies in an act of desperation. A devastated Kat believes her father is to blame for Tommy's death, as he left him alone to go for a drink. After the funeral, Ronnie attempts to return Tommy, but Kat misunderstands and believes that she is rejecting James. Charlie opts to leave Walford, although Kat forgives him before he departs. She is shocked when Michael returns to see his son, and upset when he shows no emotion at learning that he died. Kat's friend Martina Quinn (Tamara Wall) and her daughter Shenice (Lily Harvey) visit from Spain. After they leave, Kat and Alfie miss Shenice, and consider IVF to try for another baby. Their consultant feels it is too soon, and their relationship breaks down again, but eventually they reconcile. Four months after taking Tommy, Ronnie returns him and hands herself in to the police. Kat reacts with disbelief, but a DNA test reveals the truth, and Kat is reunited with Tommy. Kat is initially furious with Ronnie, but forgives her when she is sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nKat and Alfie holiday in Spain, and bring Shenice back with them. Upon their return, Kat gets pregnant again. Alfie believes that he cannot have children and assumes Kat has cheated on him, despite her insistence to the contrary. Alfie learns that he is wrong, but Kat is hurt by his accusation and will not let him near her, even after suffering a miscarriage. Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she instantly regrets. She eventually confesses to Alfie, and tells him that her behaviour is how she is and always will be. Alfie tells Kat he would rather have her cheat on him than not have her in his life. The couple attempt to mend relations with each other over Christmas, but Alfie overhears Kat saying that she thinks he no longer loves her. Alfie books a session with a marriage counsellor, which Kat initially refuses to attend. She turns up late, and Alfie tells her the counsellor never arrived. Alfie pays his friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) to pretend to be a marriage counsellor, who comes to their home. Kat tells Gerry that she believes Alfie does not love her any more and so she wants to end their marriage.\n\nAfter Charlie suffers a stroke, Kat stays with him for a number of months, until Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) calls Alfie, who is with Kat, asking him to return as Kat's relative Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) has gone through many troubles involving Michael. Kat returns with Alfie and comforts Jean, who has broken down. She confronts Michael about it, but he continues with his lies, saying that Jean has been stealing things. However, Kat is not fooled and says she will rip him apart when she finds out the truth. She continues to harass Michael and his fiancée, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), until the police get involved and caution Kat and Jean. Alfie informs Kat that he has taken a loan from Eddie Moon (David Essex) but Kat later learns that Eddie is in financial difficulties and so could not have lent them money. Kat is introduced to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) who reveals that Roxy and Alfie grew very close while she was away. Kat confronts Roxy who admits she had a crush on Alfie and confesses to giving Alfie the loan. Kat sacks her from her job as a result.\n\nAlfie tries to start a football team for the pub, and Kat takes it over. She flirts in order to get people to sign up, and continues flirting at a party, with Derek, Michael, Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Max Branning (Jake Wood), sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty the next day and attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone. Kat eventually responds and talks with the man to tell him to leave her alone, but changes her mind and they begin a frequent affair, and he supplies them with a flat to use. Kat endeavours several times to end it, but she continuously succumbs. He falls in love with her, with Kat reciprocating, and when he sends Kat flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious. Kat lies they are from Charlie, but Alfie does not believe her and asks her to be totally honest, to which Kat reveals her three-month affair, telling him he does not know the other man. Alfie is furious and throws her out. After a heart-to-heart with Michael, Kat returns to The Queen Vic to ask for Alfie's forgiveness and suggests going away for a while.\n\nAlfie forces her to end her romance, which Kat does, and they go away together to try and salvage their marriage. When they return, they are shocked to be sacked by Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). However, Kat convinces Phil to give them their jobs and home back, by telling him she is trying to repair their relationship after the affair. When her mystery lover gives her another key to their flat, she writes \"Kat loves Alfie\" in lipstick on a mirror. As time goes on, Alfie becomes steadily more paranoid of Kat's activity, believing she is still having the affair. Alfie follows her the bedsit where there are petals on the bed and candles are lit. She refuses to answer his questions but Alfie finds a letter address to Mr Branning. Alfie goes back to The Queen Vic where he confronts all three Branning brothers. One of their phones rings, and Alfie answers Kat's call. The phone is Max's, but Kat reveals that it is Derek she was having the affair with. Alfie kicks Kat out of their home and Kat stays with Derek, who promises to show Alfie a message on her phone where she tries to break up with him, but he plays a message where she begs to see him. Kat discovers this and an argument between them, along with Derek's other family arguments, lead to him dying from a heart attack.\n\nAlfie starts a relationship with Roxy, who moves in with Alfie, upsetting Kat. Kat teams up with Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) to earn money cleaning, first at the R&R and then at The Queen Vic after being given a job by Roxy. Kat and Bianca are fired from both jobs, so they decide to set up a market stall together, with Alfie offering money to help them start. Kat is upset when Alfie changes the licensee name from Kat to Roxy on the plaque above The Queen Vic doors. Alfie helps Kat when she is questioned over stolen goods, but to prove his love to Roxy, he decides he wants to divorce Kat. Kat fights with Roxy, and has sex with Michael, which she regrets the next day, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) tells Kat to take control of her life, so Kat tells Roxy and Alfie she had sex with Michael and that he is a better lover than Alfie. Kat has an ongoing feud with Roxy, and is upset when she finds out Roxy and Alfie are trying for a baby. When a man named Josef (Aleksandar Mikic) tries to steal money from the pub's safe, Kat helps Roxy by convincing him not to. Roxy thanks Kat but then accuses her of trying to win Alfie back, which Kat denies. Kat and Alfie receive their decree nisi. Kat says it is not too late to cancel, but Alfie insists he has moved on and proposes to Roxy.\n\nWhen Kat learns that Roxy is not going to meet Ronnie at her release from prison, she goes instead. Ronnie is unwilling to talk to Kat at first, but soon the pair discover that various tragedies in their past mean that they have plenty in common. Kat offers Ronnie a bed for the night, and then gradually persuades Alfie to accept Ronnie's presence back in Walford. This and Michael's death bring Kat and Alfie closer together. The night before his wedding, Alfie visits Kat and it leads to them kissing passionately, but she stops it. Distraught that she cannot be with Alfie, Kat decides to leave Walford, but Bianca takes her to the wedding and Kat walks in to see Alfie say \"I do\" to Roxy. She leaves the church and heads for the airport, but after she has boarded the plane, Alfie embarks and declares his love for her. He is forced off by security and Kat follows, reuniting with a kiss.\n\nPhil decides to sell The Queen Vic, as revenge for Alfie's treatment of Roxy, and Kat and Alfie move back in with Mo. Kat then reveals that she is pregnant by Alfie, and discovers that she is having twins. Having spotted her cousin Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) from the top deck of a bus, Kat decides to track her down. She visits Janine in prison, and agrees to provide a false witness statement for Michael's murder, in return for Janine dropping false charges against Stacey, so that she can return to Walford. At her trial, Janine confesses to her crimes, and Kat is charged with perjury. She is devastated when Stacey hands herself over to the police for Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) murder (see Who Killed Archie?), five years previously. Kat attends a hearing, and is given a suspended sentence. After the market is merged with Spring Lane, Kat immediately clashes with her new rival, Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) and is later surprised when Alfie reveals he has bought a pitch on the market. Kat gives birth to Bert and Ernie Moon. Stacey is released after she appeals her sentence and comes to live with Alfie and Kat. The financial situation becomes worse for the Moons when Alfie reveals they are to be evicted as they have not been paying their bills.\n\nKat briefly works the market again, but marker inspector Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) forces her off her stall when he discovers she is working and claiming maternity benefit. Alfie lies to her that he has managed to convince the council to give them more time to rally together the money they need, but secretly plans to claim house insurance by setting fire to their house. He does so, but is unaware Kat is inside. She becomes trapped although Alfie rescues her. She is badly burnt and suffers permanent scarring to her face. On leaving hospital, she and Alfie remarry with two nurses as the only witnesses, before returning to the square and moving into a flat Alfie has organised for them to squat in. When the owners arrive, they are thrown out and Kat is angry with Alfie, although out of desperation they squat in a new flat with help from Donna. Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) calls the landlord of the flat when trying to fix the boiler, so they are evicted again and they stay at The Queen Vic with Alfie's friend Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). After Kat makes an emotional speech to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull. Stacey tries to stop her but before they leave Kat discovers a photo of Nana that was not lost in the house. Alfie confesses that it was he who started the fire. Kat, appalled by the disclosure, insists their marriage is over and stays with Stacey and Lily. Mo tells Kat that Harry left her some money in his will. Alfie finds out, and tries to convince her to use the money to make a fresh start after the divorce. She takes the cheque from Mo and later rips it up in front of Alfie, insisting it doesn't change the past nor their impending divorce.\n\nKat begins to have second thoughts about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family. Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but at the urging of Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.\n\nAfter the visit from the social worker, Kat tells Stacey and Mo that she will start saving up to visit Zoe in Spain. Two days later, Kat receives a text from Zoe saying she does not want to see her. Kat is devastated and she writes a letter to the solicitors about receiving all the remaining money from Harry's will, and intends to post it the next morning. The next day, following a conversation with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), Kat changes her mind and throws the letter away but Mo retrieves it and posts it on her behalf. After Kat is robbed, Stacey discovers that Kat has been overdosing on Tommy's medicine. Kat admits to drinking the medicine to numb out her thoughts about Harry, but promises to stop. When Stacey tells Mo that the money would not be good for Kat, Mo has a change of heart and has Harry's money transferred to her own account. Kat later finds out about this, and then, after burning the money, falls into a depression and tries to kill herself. Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance, at the hospital he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily in order to help her with the children and her upcoming visit from another social worker. During the visit, Kat remains withdrawn from answering questions about how she is feeling and why she attempted suicide and insists she is fine, but Alfie says on her behalf that she is not fine but that they are working on it, and admits to the social worker his feelings of guilt from starting the fire.\n\nAfter she almost kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it and goes to Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie that she wants to get back together with him, but he tells her that he is not ready as he does not want to hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and they talk about the past and the future. Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to make a statement about Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son. Later, a content Kat returns to Walford and tells Stacey and Alfie that she has finally made her peace with the past and is no longer willing to let Harry control her.\n\nKat tells Alfie that she wants to reunite with him, and although he initially resists, he later changes his mind. They buy a lottery scratchcard and win £1,000,000. They then plan to move to Spain so Kat can be closer to Zoe. Alfie discovers he has a brain tumor and decides not to tell Kat, so as not to worry her. Kat and Alfie then leave with Tommy, Bert and Ernie to live in Spain.\n\nKat returns to Walford to spend Christmas with Stacey. Alfie follows with the children, and it is revealed that Zoe does not want to see her. Kat is surprised when Sister Ruth visits her, and reveals the truth about her son, whom the nuns called Luke, and Ruth reveals he was adopted by an Irish family. Kat realises Mo knew about Luke, and argues with Mo and Charlie. Charlie has a heart attack and dies, leaving Kat devastated. Belinda returns and blames Kat for Charlie's death. Alfie tells her that he has a brain tumour, but assures her it is benign. Kat vows to attend Charlie's funeral, despite her sisters not wanting her there, but on the day, Stacey is mentally ill so Kat stays with her at The Queen Vic. She makes amends with Belinda and tells her about Luke. Belinda then reveals that Viv once took the family (minus Kat) to a village in Ireland called Redwater, and Viv visited a church and left crying, blaming Kat for this, and Belinda saw a couple with a boy watching them leave. Kat then finds out information about Redwater but she and Alfie then leave for Spain.\n\nIn episode 1 of \"Kat & Alfie: Redwater\", Kat (referred to as \"Kathleen\" in the series), Alfie and Tommy arrive in the Irish town of Redwater, where Kathleen is almost immediately convinced that Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion) is her son, while Andrew's grandmother, Agnes Byrne (Fionnula Flanagan) is suspicious of her. Alfie warns Kathleen to wait for the right time and make friends first, but Kathleen confides in Agnes's husband Lance (Ian McElhinney) that her son was taken away from her in 1983 and she believes he is in Redwater. Lance tells Agnes this, and Agnes immediately says Kathleen should not be told the truth as it would unravel everything they have built. Kathleen visits the Byrnes' farm and talks to Andrew about his life, but then Lance warns him to give the Moons a wide berth. Kathleen then admits to Alfie that she is scared of seeing how disappointed her son would be in her. Lance tells the local priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack), that Kathleen is his real mother. It is revealed that Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) lost a baby in London and brought Dermott back as her own, and her husband Peter (Stanley Townsend) does not know the truth. The next day, Dermott murders Lance by drowning him.\n\nIn episode 2, Kathleen and Alfie are invited to Lance's wake by Peter, and when speaking to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kathleen realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kathleen and Alfie, so Kathleen realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kathleen gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kathleen explains she did not know she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks if he has a big brother. Later, Kathleen and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kathleen and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kathleen that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kathleen that he found his brother. Kathleen realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this.\n\nIn episode 3, Kathleen and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kathleen lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kathleen refusing to tell him. In episode 4, Agnes urges Kathleen to return to Spain. When Dermott learns of this he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kathleen away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kathleen has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his brothers in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kathleen over this, who said she was waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know.\n\nIn episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kathleen about the last time she saw Lance and Kathleen wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kathleen is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kathleen and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kathleen. Kathleen tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kathleen in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kathleen asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kathleen is thrown into the water and cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kathleen out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.\n\nIn episode 1 of \"EastEnders: The Podcast\", \"Kat's Indecent Proposal\", set in Málaga in March 2018 and released in November 2018, Kat and Alfie have been running a bar in Spain but have split up and Kat is in a relationship with their business partner, Dimitri (Andrew Byron), who proposes to Kat. Kat finds out from Sofia (Gloria Sanders) that Dimitri invested in Kat and Alfie's bar so that he could run it into the ground and eliminate his competition. Kat wants to see the contract Alfie and Dimitri signed, which makes Alfie think she wants a divorce and he decides to close down the bar. Kat realises Dimitri's controlling ways and decides to take Tommy, Bert and Ernie back to England with Alfie, and leaves Alfie a voicemail saying this and telling him that she loves him. However, Alfie deletes the voicemail without listening to it. Kat and Dimitri go to the bar but Alfie is out, so they stay the night. The next morning, Dimitri does not allow Kat to leave the bed to make breakfast for the children. Tommy decides to make breakfast and Kat's relative, Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis) arrives to witness Tommy dropping the kettle on Ernie, who is scalded. Kat sees this and screams.\n\nMo returns to Walford, telling Stacey that Kat has died. Stacey raises money for Kat's funeral, but Jean arrives and tells Stacey that Kat is not dead as she spoke to her that day; Mo has lied to raise money as she has financial problems. Kat returns to Walford and is confused that The Queen Vic is holding a benefit night for her and confronts Mo, but hides when Ian brings the raised money. After Ian leaves, Kat reveals that she and Alfie are taking a break from their marriage and he is in Spain with their children running a bar with a Russian partner after their old bar lost a fortune. Kat, Stacey and Mo arrive at The Queen Vic when Mick is giving a speech about Kat and attempt to maintain that Mo made a mistake, but she starts a fight with Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley), which starts a bar fight. Jean pays off Mo's debt, and Kat starts a cleaning business to pay Jean back. Kat is furious when she finds Hayley in Walford. She demands that Hayley leave, but Hayley threatens to reveal what has happened in Spain. It becomes clear to the Slaters that Kat is hiding something and it is revealed that Kat has had an affair and was not watching when one of the children burnt themselves, leading to Alfie kicking her out. Kat does not know that soon after this incident, Alfie and Hayley had a one-night stand, which has resulted in Hayley becoming pregnant with his child. After Hayley tells Alfie, who is staying in London, about the pregnancy, he tries to persuade Hayley to terminate the pregnancy and returns to Spain, but Hayley decides to keep the baby.\n\nKat gets a video call from Alfie and he asks her to collect something for him. Believing him to still be in Spain, she follows his instructions and goes to a chapel where she is surprised to see Alfie in person. Alfie is running a funeral business and has many clients lined up, but Kat is unimpressed and only sees it as a scam. She is angry that he has not brought their children with him, but apologies for cheating on him with Dimitri. Kat tells him to stop his lies and jokes and she leaves. The following week Kat speaks to Alfie, who is back in Spain, by video call and she is angry when he says he lied to her and actually did bring the children with him to London. Two weeks later, during Hayley's birthday party, Kat answers the door and is shocked to see Alfie standing on the doorstep. Though he reunites with Kat, he is stunned to realise that Hayley did not terminate her pregnancy, and insists they keep the truth hidden from Kat. Hayley develops feelings for him when she sees him bond with their daughter, named Cherry by Alfie after his deceased mother. Jean, who is the only one who has found out about Alfie being Cherry's father, insists that Alfie tell Kat or she will.\n\nWhen Kat goes out on her motorbike, she visits a café that Charlie used to take her to when she was a child. Kat meets family friend Tony, who remembers her and Charlie and they bond over their memories. Tony takes Kat to his local pub, where they see Tony and Charlie's friend, Maurice, but he is reluctant to meet Kat. When Kat demands to know Maurice's problem with her, he tells her that one night he was with Charlie and her uncle Harry, and Harry said he \"knew how to shut her up\". Maurice realised that he was talking about sexually abusing Kat and hoped it was not true, but could not tell Kat if Charlie had heard this or not. This causes Kat to become uncertain of who she can trust for several days. Alfie brings Maurice to Walford see Kat, and Maurice admits that Charlie did not hear what Harry said and apologises, saying he was drunk when he told Kat, and admits he never really liked Charlie and saw the lie as a way of getting back at Charlie but did not think how it would affect Kat, so he apologises. This comes as a great relief to Kat, who tells Alfie she can trust again.\n\nStacey sees Hayley and Alfie kissing and is horrified to uncover Cherry's paternity and issues an ultimatum: one of them leaves, or Kat learns the truth. Hayley decides to go, but her parting gift to Alfie – a lock of Cherry's hair – is discovered by Kat and she works out the truth. Horrified about this and that Jean knew, she furiously trashes the living room and smashes the windows in Alfie's car, then after a tearful drunken karaoke performance at the pub, realises that Stacey also knew and admits she can no longer trust anyone after what happened. After she yells at him, Alfie turns nasty with Kat, who accuses him of taking advantage of Hayley's vulnerability. Hayley defends Kat and pushes Alfie, causing him to fall down the stairs and knock himself unconscious. Believing that he is dead, Hayley, Kat and Stacey discuss what to do to protect Hayley from going to prison. Kat privately says a tender goodbye to Alfie, kissing him and telling him she loves him. As the police arrive, they discover that Alfie survived and has left, taking Cherry with him. The next day, Kat leaves a voicemail on Alfie's phone, pleading with him to bring Cherry back. Alfie eventually contacts Kat and Hayley via video chat and says he will bring Cherry back soon. On New Year's Day, Alfie and Kat meet and Kat tries to talk him into returning Cherry but Alfie admits he cannot bring himself to do it, fearing he would only be granted limited visitation time, and suggests he and Kat adopt Cherry and leave together. Conflicted, Kat at first decides to accept and asks Alfie to come to the empty house through the back door. However, she later changes her mind and tells Stacey, Mo and Jean, who proceed to confront Alfie when he arrives. Angry and upset, he shows them Ernie's scars caused by Kat's irresponsibility. When Kat takes the children for ice cream, she gives Alfie the option to take them with him on the condition that he brings Cherry back to Hayley. Alfie eventually relents to return Cherry and leave their children with Kat, admitting that he loves her and only wanted her to be happy. The next day, after emotionally attempting to say goodbye to Cherry, Alfie changes his mind and attempts to drive out of Walford with her but finds himself stuck in traffic. This forces him to reevaluate his decision and he turns back and returns Cherry to Hayley. When Ian tells Kat that Hayley rejected Alfie's offer to be a part of Cherry's life, a sympathetic Kat allows him to spend time with their children. Kat reconsiders a relationship with Alfie, but Alfie's scam leads into debt and after borrowing money from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and not being able to pay it back, Alfie flees Walford and fakes his death, leaving Kat with money which he took from Phil.\n\nPhil taunts Kat for the money that Alfie had stolen from him, but Kat does not know about the money or on Alfie's whereabouts and Phil holds her responsible for Alfie's debt to him. However, Kat later discovers the money and uses half of it to fund for Jean's cancer treatment. Things come to a head when Phil takes Tommy and asks him questions about Alfie. After a brief fling with Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), they begin dating, but their relationship is under threat when Kush announces that he wants to file for joint custody over his and Stacey's son, Arthur. Stacey accuses Kat of supporting Kush and a rift forms between them. Kat attempts to rebuild their relationship but a hurt Stacey refuses and kicks Kat out of her home. Kat moves in with Kush and makes several attempts to reconcile with Stacey which backfires in her face when Stacey hides the money that Alfie had left her. Unfortunately for Kat, Phil revives his interest on the money and he asks Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) to retrieve the money back from the Slaters. They eventually give the money back but Phil continues to menace the Slaters about keeping the money. Whilst drunk in The Queen Vic, Kat drunkly mocks Phil about the stolen money and as a result Phil threatens her children. This leads to a showdown between Kat and Phil in The Arches. Martin tries to intervene but Phil becomes aggressive with him and Stacey, in defense, hits him across the head with a wrench. Phil's son Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) arrives soon after and orders the Slaters to leave. Stacey and Martin flee Walford in fear of Stacey being imprisoned. Ben frames Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) for the attack and he also flees Walford. Kat reveals the truth about the attack to Kush and he moves into the Slater household to protect her against Phil. After recovering, Phil starts to remember details about the attack and confronts Kat who reveals that Ben had covered it up. As revenge, Ben threatens Kat and Jean about Stacey being the culprit. Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) asks Kat to cover her stall as she is being stalked by Leo King (Tom Wells). Leo informs the council that Kat has been working on Whitney's stall without a license, which causes a feud. When Leo is pushed off the balcony of The Prince Albert by Kush, Whitney agrees to help Kush by giving the police a stalking log that she had recorded of Leo. Whitney loses it and Kush is threatened with a criminal record, however Whitney is imprisoned for murdering Leo. Whitney's lawyer Gray Atkins (Toby Alexander-Smith) convinces Kush that pleading guilty will help with Whitney's case, but she is refused bail and Kush ends up with a criminal record. Whilst having celebratory drinks in The Queen Vic for Whitney's release from prison, Kat is contacted by an unknown person for help and briefly leaves Walford.\n\nIn 2000, \"EastEnders\" executive producer John Yorke decided to introduce the \"classic\" Slater family. He felt the show needed to go back to its roots and bring back some traditional values. BBC's head of drama, Mal Young commented, \"We do not have enough solid families in the soap, there were a lot of fractured families and people who were alone.\" The family were created as a replacement for the di Marco family, who were axed by Yorke. The family consisted of, grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse), father Charlie (Derek Martin), his four children, Lynne (Elaine Lordan), Kat (Wallace), Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth), Zoe (Michelle Ryan), as well as Lynne's boyfriend Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves).\n\nIt later transpired that Kat was the mother of Zoe, after being raped by her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick). Actress Jessie Wallace was cast in the role of Kat after the character was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year. Speaking of her casting, Wallace commented: \"I'm pleased to be playing the champion floosie in the square. I want to achieve Cindy Beale proportions! Basically, Kat goes clubbing, steals other people's men and gets into fights. I love her. Everyone's warned me to expect a lot of stick in the street – Kat's such a full-on character. But I'm prepared for the fact that my life's going to change completely. I can't wait, but at the same time I'm scared.\" Wallace made her first on-screen appearance as Kat on 18 September 2000.\n\nThe character was described as \"a bit of a floozy\", \"fiery\", \"a bitch\" and \"feisty\". Kat is described by the \"EastEnders\" website saying that as soon as she arrived in Walford with her \"fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings\", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of \"Viagra to the men of Albert Square\". It continues to read: \"Her mum had died, dad was grieving and nan (Mo) was touting stolen meat off the back of lorries (some things never change).\nKat wasted very little time in establishing herself as a drama queen by shocking everyone with the revelation that her youngest sister, Zoe was in fact her daughter. Then she stole her dishy doctor boyfriend for good measure.\" It continues: \"With her enemies closing in, there was nothing to do but return home to Walford for help, complete with a huge baby bump\"\nShane Richie revealed that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to \"Inside Soap\" Richie commented: \"People don't like it when Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I like to think of it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage.\" With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: \"As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!\"\n\nUpon the return of Kat's father Charlie, Wallace said that this will provide a \"big boost\" to her character. Talking to \"We Love Telly\", asked whether it's important for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: \"Yes, definitely. With what happened the night they thought Tommy died, things were still unresolved for them. Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now makes it all the more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this.\" Discussing what type of mother Kat will be, Wallace added: \"I think she wants to be the best mum possible. She knows that this is her second chance to make a go of it and she is determined to do a good job.\"\n\nOn 24 April 2004, it was announced that Wallace was pregnant with her first child and that she would take maternity leave from \"EastEnders\" later in the year. Wallace was intended to depart in December, however a pregnancy scare meant that she was forced to stop filming in August, and scripts featuring Kat subsequently had to be re-written. She returned to filming in February 2005 and made her on-screen return in May. Wallace signed a six-month contract in a reported bid to boost the show's ratings.\n\nIn July 2005, the BBC announced that Wallace had decided to leave \"EastEnders\" in a mutual decision with producers. A spokesperson for the show praised Wallace's talent and thanked her for her contribution to the series, stating that \"Jessie and the writers want Kat Moon to go out on a high.\" Kat's exit storyline centred upon her on-off relationship with husband Alfie. Shane Richie, who plays him, also announced his decision to quit in April 2005. In 2009, Wallace stated that she missed playing Kat but had no immediate plans to return to \"EastEnders\", despite rumours to the contrary. She noted that the public still associated her with her role, and that she was flattered people still remembered her.\n\nIn February 2010, it was announced that Richie and Wallace would be reprising their roles as Alfie and Kat respectively, with Wallace commenting that she was \"excited to slip back into Kat Slater's stilettos.\" Controller of BBC drama production John Yorke predicted that their return would make \"fantastic viewing\", given the wealth of new characters introduced since their departure. Wallace signed an initial one-year contract, and returned to filming in July. Wallace and Richie were the first cast members signed by new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood. The decision was made following the resignation of Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy Mitchell, which left what Kirkwood described as a \"hole\" in the programme. Kirkwood decided that the time was right for Kat and Alfie to return, saying that they \"very much herald the new era of \"EastEnders\".\"\n\nThe plot saw Alfie and Kat regaining control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burned down, and Kat returning to Walford pregnant, with some public suspicions about the paternity of her child . To promote the characters' return, the BBC released a trailer across the BBC network in September 2010. The western-themed trailer sees Kat outside of The Queen Victoria, with various characters looking on and Kat saying \"Where d'ya get a drink around 'ere?\" with Alfie replying \"I think you're gonna' need one.\" The advertisement uses the tag line \"It's all kicking off in the square\". The return, in September 2010, drew 9.22 million viewers and 37.7% of the total TV viewing audience. Kat returned on 17 September 2010.\n\nWallace admitted she was nervous about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to \"TVTimes\", Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: \"I missed playing Kat,\" she said. \"Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, but as soon as I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant.\"\n\nTalking to \"What's on TV\", Wallace commented on Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: \"She punches him! Alfie has come looking for her and hasn't seen her for months. He keeps saying to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will always end up together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this challenge and he buys it.\"\n\nRichie revealed in an interview with \"This Morning\" that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is \"going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps.\" At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about \"EastEnders\" storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the \"Daily Star Sunday\" that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An \"EastEnders\" spokesperson said, \"We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will do the right thing and Tommy will be reunited with Kat.\" Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was \"just doing her job\". Wallace told \"Bang Showbiz\":\"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it.\" She also praised Womack's acting and vowed to move on to \"bigger and better things\" after she departed. She added: \"[Samantha is] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best.\"\n\nDerek Martin said he was surprised by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on \"This Morning\", Martin commented: \"I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked [and saw], 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I was surprised when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [lines] – that it was a baby swap.\" Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: \"Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is.\" He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [Charlie's] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life.\"\n\nNina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace for their \"acting skills\" during the storyline. Wadia told \"The Sun\": \"Sam and Jessie were amazing and it all got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!\" Marc Elliott added: \"The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not representative in any way, shape or form of mothers who have lost their babies.\" \"EastEnders\" actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its \"great acting\". In an interview with \"Take It Easy\", asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: \"I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that is always going to be sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting.\"\n\nSamantha Womack admitted that she thought the plot was \"implausible\". She commented: \"I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one,\" she told the \"Daily Mirror\". \"But Ronnie is a soap character and she is not necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it.\" On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented \"in an offensive manner\" because it \"appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss\". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: \"Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world.\"\n\nWallace previously stated that filming the baby swap storylines \"did not stretch her acting abilities\". She told \"Buzz\": \"None of it's been really tough for me, to tell you the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to.\" On a lighter note, Wallace added: \"There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Buzz\", Richie said that although that Kat and Alfie have received Tommy back, the couple still have problems to face. He commented: \"Kat and Alfie are happy to have Tommy back, but they still buried the baby they thought was their son. That destroyed them and their relationship. The cot-death storyline is just the start of what's going to happen to Kat and Alfie. I've also heard rumours about whether Alfie is really firing blanks. He had a fertility test in Spain. Could it be wrong?\" Wallace and Richie have hinted that the plot could have a long lasting impact on Kat and Alfie. Shane Richie added: \"While Alfie happily throws himself into being a dad to Tommy, it's Kat who's going to be finding things difficult.\"\n\nShortly after Kat is reunited with her baby, it was announced that Kat would fall pregnant by Alfie, despite Alfie believing he is infertile. Shortly after finding out she is pregnant, Kat falls ill and is rushed to hospital and discovers that she has suffered a miscarriage. The \"Daily Star\" reports: \"The pregnancy takes Kat and Alfie completely by surprise and neither of them know how they really feel about it,\" a source said. \"Kat is understandably very nervous and anxious about having another baby. Her head is all over the place. But before she has a chance to get used to the idea she suffers a miscarriage. It is a cruel thing to happen to them after everything that they've already been through this year. And once again viewers will be in tears as they watch Kat come to terms with losing her baby.\" An \"EastEnders\" spokesperson added: \"There is a little bit more heartache for Kat and Alfie as they try to rebuild their lives with Tommy.\"\n\nAn additional \"EastEnders\" insider also commented: \"The fact that Kat gets pregnant at all is amazing. Alfie has believed that he was infertile after trying to have kids with his wife for ages with no luck. So when Kat finds out that she's expecting, it's devastating not least because it raises some big questions in Alfie's mind.\" The insider added to \"Inside Soap\": \"Who can blame Alfie for asking some questions here? He stood by Kat while she had his cousin's baby and through the misery of losing baby Tommy. It would be absolutely devastating for him to learn that all this tragedy has driven them apart again.\" \"STV\" added that after forgiving Kat for cheating on him with Michael, Alfie would find it hard to get over another betrayal.\n\nIn 2011, Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland as Alfie is showing no interest in her. An insider said: \"The trouble is that while Alfie is busy playing that game, a delivery driver who calls at the Queen Vic makes a big play for Kat – and soon she's facing serious temptation.\" The insider added: \"Kat is vulnerable, insecure and at odds with Alfie. It's exactly the sort of state that could see her do something very stupid indeed. Alfie has done serious damage to their marriage but Kat could destroy it completely.\" Another source added: \"In accusing her of cheating on him, Alfie has undone years of good work in building up Kat's self-esteem. No matter what he says now, she feels as though he still sees her as a woman of loose morals. He cooks up a hare-brained plan to keep Kat by treating her mean – and starts ignoring her, basically.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"All About Soap\" Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: \"It's the last thing he expected to hear. He didn't see it coming. He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them in the heat of the moment, but those words have stuck with Kat.\" Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: \"Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one,\" he explained. \"I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?\"\n\nKat was written out of \"EastEnders\" temporarily in January 2012. The writers for \"EastEnders\" organised \"emergency script changes\" which saw Kat called away to care for her father Charlie after a stroke. It was announced shortly after Wallace's break from \"EastEnders\" that Sharon Watts, played by Letitia Dean, would return to the series. Numerous tabloids reported that the purpose of Dean's return is to replace Jessie Wallace; this was later denied by an \"EastEnders\" spokesperson. The spokesperson commented: \"There is no link between Letitia's return to EastEnders and Jessie not being around at the moment. We have been working on plans to bring Sharon back for quite some time.\" An insider added: \"Jessie and Letitia are two fantastic actresses and their characters are firm favourites with fans. Viewers can look forward to seeing them back on screen together later this year.\"\n\nKat returned to the show on 7 June 2012. Wallace praised \"EastEnders\" writers for bringing back Kat's funny and feisty attitude. Wallace added that it's like going home to her family and that she has missed Shane Richie. Wallace further explained: \"Before [my] break, I had the baby swap story and towards the end of last year, Kat was becoming very downtrodden. Now she's coming back fighting fit. It's almost like when Kat first arrived on screen in 2000. She's come back with those original feisty, tarty, funny and a bit cold sides to her. It's a new Kat.\"\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Kat would embark on a long-running affair with another Albert Square resident after becoming bored with the lack of attention at home. The identity of her lover was kept secret from both the cast and the crew; all scenes of Kat with her lover were filmed with an extra. Speaking of the storyline, Executive Producer Lorraine Newman said: \"The consequences are not only great for Kat and Alfie, but also for each individual suspect. The audience will join the cast and crew guessing across the summer and autumn as we eliminate the suspects one at a time, leading to one almighty explosion.\" After the storyline was announced, five suspects were revealed as potential candidates: Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). In a poll on the website \"Digital Spy\", Jack Branning was shown to be the favourite with 43.5% of the votes. Ray was eliminated when he walked in on Kat while she was on the phone to her lover. Michael was eliminated when Kat confessed to him that she was having an affair. With only the three Branning brothers left as suspects, it was revealed on 20 December that Kat's mystery lover was Derek.\n\nOn 4 April 2015, the BBC announced that Wallace would appear in a six-part BBC One drama series alongside Richie and would also be departing \"EastEnders\". In the series, Kat and Alfie visit Ireland in the \"search for answers to some very big questions\". Speaking about the show, Wallace commented: \"I have always loved working on \"EastEnders\" so when I heard of this new drama to take Kat and Alfie outside of Walford, I couldn’t believe our luck. To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is a dream come true and a huge compliment.\" The series, \"\" began airing in May 2017.\n\n\"Kat and Alfie: Redwater\" follows Kat and her husband Alfie as they arrive in the fictional Irish village of Redwater to \"search for answers to some very big questions\" and put their past behind them. Treadwell-Collins confirmed that \"the discovery that Kat has a secret son will [...] ultimately lead to the Moons realising that the answers to so many questions lie across the sea in Ireland.\" Director Jesper W. Nielsen said the series is \"About how one woman's search for a lost child opens Pandora's box; revealing the terrible lies and secrets in the little village of Redwater\". Writer Matthew Graham said, \"Kathleen Moon is an unwitting bomb in \"Redwater\" and creating the debris from her explosive arrival is what drew me to this project.\" He also said: \"Everything [Kathleen] does comes out of the fact she doesn't think much of herself. So, her humour and her in-your-face qualities all come out of a place of insecurity. She doesn't think she's good enough. That's what I use when I'm writing Kat.\"\n\nWallace was given a makeover for her part in \"Redwater\", different to how Kat looks in \"EastEnders\". Wallace explained that Kat's different look is because she has \"mellowed\" since leaving Walford and travelling to Spain, which she described as a \"softer side to Kat than we've seen before\", but said she still has a \"fiery side to her, just not as much as we've seen in \"EastEnders\". Wallace described Kat as a \"colourful person\" with \"a lot of layers to her\" and said that after playing her for 16 years \"means there's plenty underneath to bring to the surface.\" She said that Kat wants \"peace and to settle down with no more drama in her life.\" In the series, the character is called \"Kathleen\" by all characters except Alfie, who calls her \"Kat\".\n\nOn 20 December 2017, it was announced Jessie Wallace would reprise her role as Kat in Spring 2018. Her return was masterminded by interim producer John Yorke, who created the Slaters in 2000, and Kat will return alongside her grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse), and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright). Yorke commented: \"The Slaters are one of the all-time great families in \"EastEnders\" and Albert Square has never felt quite the same since they scattered to different ends of the country, and in some cases beyond. It has been a real joy to find a way to bring them back together and we’re incredibly excited about where we are taking them next. It won’t just be familiar Slaters either as there are a couple of twists and characters to add fresh spice to an iconic creation.\" Wallace added: \"I am thrilled to be returning to \"EastEnders\" next year and knowing what John Yorke has in store for the Slaters is incredibly exciting. I love Kat and Walford dearly and I cannot wait to get started – watch out Walford, Kat’s coming home.\"\n\nWallace praised Yorke for returning to family orientated drama and for revitalising the Slaters, a family he introduced, stating that there is \"hustle and bustle\" within the family. Wallace explained that upon her return, Kat has \"got debris to clear up, all the damage\" caused by the news of her death imparted by Mo, but her \"fun side\" has returned, but wants Kat to remain single. With regard to other interactions, Kat could \"clash\" with Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley), matriarch of the newly established Taylor family.\n\nOn 26 January 2020, it was announced Wallace had been suspended from the soap for two months due to her off-screen behaviour and Kat would depart later in the year. It was stated Wallace had shown up to set drunk and had gotten into a fight with co-workers. Kat departed on-screen on 23 March 2020.\n\nWallace has won multiple awards for her portrayal of Kat. At the National Television Awards, she was named \"Most Popular Newcomer\" in 2001 and \"Most Popular Actress\" in 2003. She also received \"Most Popular Actress\" nominations in 2002, 2004 and 2005. At The British Soap Awards, Wallace won \"Best Newcomer\" in 2001. The following year, \"EastEnders\" won \"Best Single Episode\" for the episode in which Zoe learns Kat is her mother. Wallace was additionally nominated for the \"Best Actress\", \"Best Dramatic Performance\" and \"Hero of the Year\" awards in 2002, and Zoe's maternity was nominated \"Best Storyline\". She was again nominated \"Best Actress\" from 2003 to 2006 consecutively, and shared \"Best On-Screen Partnership\" and \"Best Exit\" nominations with Richie in 2004 and 2006 respectively. She was further nominated in 2011 for 'Best Actress'. The \"Inside Soap\" Awards named Wallace \"Best Newcomer\" in 2001, Zoe's maternity \"Best Storyline\" in 2002, and Kat and Alfie \"Best Couple\" in 2004. A 2009 poll by \"Inside Soap\" magazine named Kat as the UK's favourite drama queen in a soap opera. Wallace was named \"Best Soap Actress\" at the 2003 \"TV Quick\" Awards. Following Kat's suicide attempt, Wallace received the 2002 Mental Health Media Award in the \"Soaps and Continual Drama\" category. The character's 2018 return storyline was nominated for \"Most Bizarre Soap Storyline\" at the 2018 \"Digital Spy\" Reader Awards; it came in third place with 15% of the total votes.\n\nA 2010 poll by \"Just Eat\" to find the \"most desired dinner companions\" from \"EastEnders\" put Kat in second place. After the announcement of Jessie Wallace playing the role of Kat, Steve Hendry from the \"Sunday Mail\" referred to Kat as a \"stunner\". In February 2011, following Kat's return to \"EastEnders\", Wallace was nominated for Best Actress at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards for her portrayal of Kat, and was also nominated alongside Richie for Best Comeback. She won the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Award for \"TV Soap Personality\" in March 2011. Also in February, the scenes revealing Kat as Zoe's mother has become \"one of the most iconic moments in the history of EastEnders\". In September 2011, Kat and Andy's wedding was voted as a \"wedding from hell\" by \"Yahoo!\". After the announcement that Kat is to have a miscarriage, Tony Stewart from the \"Daily Mirror\" said that after the baby swap storyline, this is perhaps \"too much agony for Kat to bear\". An \"EastEnders\" source added that \"It is a cruel thing to happen to them after everything that they've already been through this year\". Laura-Jayne Tyler of \"Inside Soap\" enjoyed Kat's 2018 reintroduction and said that Wallace returned \"on full gas, giving nothing less than her trademark powerhouse performances\". She felt that Kat's return gave the show \"the vital spark [it has] been missing.\" She added, \"You can take the girl out of Walford, but you'll never take Walford out of the girl...\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1980907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1980907", "title": "Edward William Godwin", "text": "Edward William Godwin\n\nEdward William Godwin (26 May 1833, Bristol – 6 October 1886, London) was a progressive English architect-designer, who began his career working in the strongly polychromatic \"Ruskinian Gothic\" style of mid-Victorian Britain, inspired by \"The Stones of Venice\", then moved on to provide designs in the \"Anglo-Japanese taste\" of the Aesthetic Movement and Whistler's circle in the 1870s. Godwin's influence can be detected in the Arts and Crafts Movement.\n\nHis best known early works include The Guild Hall, Northampton (\"illustration, right\"), which was his first notable public commission, and Town Hall, Congleton, as well as restorations and neo-Gothic additions to Dromore Castle, Limerick and Castle Ashby.\n\nApprenticed to an engineer in Bristol, where his architectural training was largely self-taught, Godwin moved to London about 1862, and made the acquaintance of the reform Gothic designer William Burges. As an antiquary, he had a particular interest in medieval costume, furniture and architecture.\n\nGodwin was widowed in 1865; during his affair with the renowned actress Ellen Terry between 1868 and 1874, she retired with him to Hertfordshire, and produced two children: Edith Craig {1869-1947} and Edward Gordon Craig (1872–1966), who became an important actor, designer, director, and theoretical writer of the early 20th century European stage. The affair inspired Godwin to spend much time designing theatrical costumes and scenery. After she returned to the theatre and their connection cooled, Godwin married a young designer in his office, Beatrice/Beatrix Birnie Philip (1857–1896), who bore him a son, Edward. After Godwin's death, she married the painter James Whistler in 1888. Godwin was a frequent contributor to the periodical \"British Architect\" and published a number of books on architecture, costume and theatre.\n\nTo judge from his sketchbooks at the Victoria and Albert Museum, one might have expected an eclectic historicist, but Godwin, by no means a tame reproducer of antiquarian Gothic designs, was among the first to extend the European design repertory to include the arts of Japan, which had been opened to the Western world in 1853. His Anglo-Japanese style of furniture, mostly executed with an ebonized finish, was designed for Dromore Castle and his own use from 1867. Similar designs produced later by the firms of William Watt and Collinson & Lock also emphasised the stripped-down \"Anglo-Japanese taste\" pared of merely decorative touches. The spirit of Japan, rather than mere details, is strongly revealed in a black cabinet Godwin designed for Collinson & Lock, now at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nIn the 1870s and 80s Godwin's designs could be found at Liberty and Co.; his wallpapers, printed textiles, tiles, \"art furniture\" or metalwork set the tone in houses of those with an artistic and progressive bent. Oscar Wilde was among his clients, describing him as \"one of the most artistic spirits of this century\", and Princess Louise, for whom he designed a studio at Kensington Palace.\n\nFrom 1876, Godwin designed houses for the new garden suburb of Bedford Park, Chiswick. His designs were thought poor, as they had steep staircases, a toilet in the bathroom, relatively small rooms, and narrow corridors. Only a few of his houses were built; they are taller and narrower than those built by other architects.\n\nIn 1877 the painter James Whistler, himself a connoisseur of Japanese prints, commissioned Godwin to build him a house in Tite Street, Chelsea, which Godwin completed the following year, in spite of its being initially objected to by The Metropolitan Board of Works. However, Whistler's bankruptcy in 1879 forced the sale of the house along with the rest of the painter's effects. The buyer of the house, an art critic, made alterations that Whistler and Godwin deplored. (The White House was demolished in the 1960s.) Whistler and Godwin shared an interest in Chinese and Japanese art and collaborated over The White House and in a number of projects involving furniture and interior design, notably \"Harmony in Yellow and Gold: The Butterfly Cabinet\". When Whistler exhibited his radical Impressionist paintings of Venice, Godwin entirely redecorated the exhibition galleries to complement them. Another house in Tite Street was commissioned by Frank Miles and completed the following year, 1878, originally number 1 but still standing and now numbered 44. Miles lived there, initially with his friend Oscar Wilde, until committed to an asylum in 1887, after which it was sold by his family to the artist, G.P. Jacomb-Hood.\n\nIn 1881, Godwin designed a new entrance for the premises in Bond Street of the Fine Art Society, a progressive venue for exhibitions of new art, where one of the first exhibitions of Japanese woodblock prints was held. \nHe died on 6 October 1886 in London from complications following an operation to remove kidney stones.\n\n"}

Goans are commonly said to be born with music and football in their blood. This is because football and music are deeply entrenched in Goan culture.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, in a population of 1,458,545 people, 66.1% were Hindu, 25.1% were Christian, and 8.3% were Muslim. Smaller minorities of about 0.1% each followed Sikhism, Buddhism, or Jainism. Goa has a history of communal harmony.\n\nThe most popular celebrations in the Indian state of Goa are the Goa Carnival, (Konkani:\"Intruz\"), Sao Jao (Feast of John the Baptist) Ganesh Chaturthi (Konkani: \"Chavoth\"), Diwali, Christmas (Konkani: \"Natalam\"), Easter (Konkani: \"Paskanchem Fest\"), Samvatsar Padvo or Sanvsar Padvo, Shigmo, The largest festival in the state is the Feast of St. Francis Xavier (Goicho Saib). Goa is also known for its New Year's celebrations. The Goan Carnival is known to attract a large number of tourists.\n\nRice with fish curry (\"Xit kodi\" in Konkani) is the staple diet in Goa. Goan cuisine is renowned for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. Coconut and coconut oil is widely used in Goan cooking along with chili peppers, spices and vinegar giving the food a unique flavour. Pork and beef dishes such as Vindaloo, Xacuti and Sorpotel are cooked for major occasions among the Catholics. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as Khatkhate, is a very popular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma. A rich egg-based multi-layered sweet dish known as bebinca is a favourite at Christmas. Cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms.\n\nThe architecture of Goa shows a distinct Portuguese influence.\n\nThe Churches and Convents of Goa are a group of six churches that are a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually St. Joseph Vaz). Once every ten years, the body is taken down for veneration and for public viewing. The last such event was conducted in 2004. The Velhas Conquistas regions are also known for its Goa-Portuguese style architecture.\n\nIn many parts of Goa, mansions constructed in the Indo-Portuguese style architecture still stand, though in some villages, most of them are in a dilapidated condition. Fontainhas in Panaji has been declared a cultural quarter, showcasing the life, architecture and culture of Goa. Some influences from the Portuguese era are visible in some of Goa's temples, notably the Mangueshi Temple, although after 1961, many of these were demolished and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Goa, followed by hockey. Cricket, athletics, chess, swimming, table tennis and basketball are other popular sports in Goa. Fishing is also a popular recreational activity.\n\nMando and dulpod are traditional goan musical forms.\n\nGoan Hindus are very fond of Natak, Bhajan and Kirtan. Many famous Indian Classical singers hail from Goa, such as, Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Jitendra Abhisheki, Prabhakar Karekar.\n\nMany Goans also perform Western classical music\n\nSome traditional Goan dance forms are dekhnni, fugdi, corridinho and dashavatara. Western social dancing is a part of most celebrations.\n\nGoans are very fond of theatre and acting. \"Kalo\" and \"dashavatar\" were popular art forms. Marathi Nataks have been very popular among Hindus in Goa for the past two centuries. Tiatr is the major Goan form of theatre common amongst Catholics and is the most commercial offering as it has entertained Goans not only in Goa but also in Mumbai and Pune (which are major cities of India and have a sizeable Goan population) and in the \"Gulf\" regions of UAE, Kuwait and so on.\n\nAround two-thirds of Goans speak Konkani as their first language, while the remaining speak other languages, such as Hindi and Marathi as their primary language. However, almost all Goans can speak and understand Konkani. Konkani is an important part of the Goan identity that binds together all Goans.\n\nGoa developed an international reputation in the 1960s as one of the prime stops on the legendary India-Nepal \"hippie trail\". In the mid-1960s, several Westerners, including \"Eight Finger Eddie\" walked over the hill to Calangute, and decided to create a community for Westerners. In the early years, Calangute and Baga were the center of this scene, but it grew over the years to include other nearby cities like Anjuna Beach, which became, and arguably still is, the center of the Western youth culture of Goa. By the mid-1980s, there were over 8000 Westerners living in Goa, mostly from Western Europe. The scene was marked by drug culture, trance music and free love. Goa remains today an international center of youth culture.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, Goa began to attract a more \"upscale\" audience, which in turn drove prices up, which in turn drove many in the \"hippie\" community to other less-expensive areas. Arambol—the beach community furthest away from \"civilization\", like electricity and running water—became the center of a battle between those wanting to turn Goa into a more traditional upscale resort area, and those wanting Goa to retain its traditional rustic counterculture appeal.\n\n\n"}

In order to receive a grant, some form of \"Grant Writing\" often referred to as either a proposal or an application is required.\n\nMost grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance and reporting. The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal (or submission) to a potential funder, either on the applicant's own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposal from the funder. Other grants can be given to individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business. Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of tax-exempt status, be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government.\n\nFor example, tiered funding for a freeway are very large grants negotiated at government policy level. However smaller grants may be provided by a government agency (e.g. municipal government).\n\nProject-related funding involving business, communities, and individuals is often arranged by application either in writing or online.\n\nIn the United States, grants most often come from a wide range of government departments or an even wider range of public and private trusts and foundations. According to the Foundation Center these trusts and foundations number in excess of 88,000 and disperse in excess of $40 billion every year. Trusts and Foundations are a little more complex to research and can be found through subscription-based directories.\n\nMost often, education grants are issued by the government to students attending post-secondary education institutions. In certain cases, a part of a government loan is issued as a grant, particularly pertaining to promising students seeking financial support for continuing their educations.\n\nGrant compliance and reporting requirements vary depending upon the type of grant and funding agency. In the case of research grants involving human or animal subjects, additional involvement with the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and/or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is required.\n\n\nThe European Commission provides financing through numerous specific calls for project proposals. These may be within Framework Programmes. Although there are many 7 year programmes that are renewed that provide money for various purposes. These may be structural funds, Youth programmes and Education programmes. There are also occasional one-off grants to deal with unforeseen aspects or special projects and themes. Most of these are administered through what are called National Agencies, but some are administered directly through the Commission in Brussels. Due to the complexity of the funding mechanisms involved and especially the high competitiveness of the grant application processes (14%) professional Grant Consulting firms are gaining importance in the grant writing process.\n\nAnother funding body in Europe is the European Council. Similarly there are calls and various projects that are funded by this Council.\n\nGrant-giving organizations in Ireland include the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Science Foundation Ireland for research grants.\n\nDenmark has an educational universal grant system, SU (\"Statens Uddannelsesstøtte\", the State Education Fund). It is available to all students from 18 years of age, with no upper limit, who are currently taking courses. There are two systems of SU.\n\nIn addition to the government grant scheme, more than 35,000 grants in Denmark exists, which is the second largest number of foundations in Europe by country. The foundations are estimated to possess 400 billion Danish kroner (US$60 billion) in accessible funds.\n\nIn Poland there exist two major grant organisations, both founded by the government:\n\nFoundation for Polish Science also offers different kinds of scientific grants for distinguished scholars, both Polish citizens and foreigners.\n\nGrants are made available in the United Kingdom for a variety of business, charitable and research purposes. The biggest grant distributors are government departments and agencies which offer grants to third party organisations (often a charitable organisation) to carry out statutory work on their behalf.\n\nOther major grant distributors in the United Kingdom are the National Lottery, charitable trusts and corporate foundations (through Corporate Social Responsibility policies). For example, Google contributes to the grants process through its Google Grants programme, where any charitable organization can benefit financially from free Google Ads advertising if they share Google's social responsibility outcomes.\n\nGrants are time limited (usually between one and three years) and are offered to implement existing government policies, to pilot new ways of doing things or to secure agreed outcomes. A grant will usually only be given for a specific project or use and will not usually be given for projects that have already begun.\n\nOver the years the discipline of writing grant bids has developed into a specialised activity. Many organisations employ fundraising professionals to carry out this work. In the United Kingdom the fundraising profession is governed by The Institute of Fundraising. The grant writing process generally includes search, proposal and accounting for competitive grant funds. Traditional search methods - for example referring to the Charities Aid Foundation Directory of Grant Making Trusts - are quickly becoming replaced by online fundraising tools.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1981018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981018", "title": "Groove metal", "text": "Groove metal\n\nGroove metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that began in the early 1990s. The genre achieved mainstream success in the 1990s and continued having some more success in the 2000s. Inspired by thrash metal and traditional heavy metal, groove metal features raspy singing and screaming, down-tuned guitars, heavy guitar riffs, and syncopated rhythms. Unlike thrash metal, groove metal is usually slower and also uses elements of traditional heavy metal. Pantera are often considered the pioneers of groove metal, and groove metal expanded in the 1990s with bands like White Zombie, Machine Head, Skinlab, and Sepultura. The genre continued in the 2000s with bands like Lamb of God, DevilDriver, Damageplan, Five Finger Death Punch and Hellyeah.\n\nGroove metal is heavily influenced by thrash metal. Unlike thrash metal, groove metal focuses more on heaviness while thrash metal often focuses more on speed. Groove metal places emphasis on heavy guitar riffs with usually syncopated rhythms, with the riffs sometimes being somewhat similar to death metal riffs. Guitars are generally down-tuned. Vocals in groove metal usually are yelling, growling, screaming, or very raspy singing. Although groove metal has a big emphasis on guitar riffs, guitar solos are still very common in groove metal. While thrash metal usually has fast tempos, groove metal usually has slower tempos, but fast tempos can be featured in groove metal. Groove metal is also often influenced by traditional heavy metal and blues-inspired heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.\n\nTexas heavy metal band Pantera's 1990 album \"Cowboys from Hell\" is considered the first groove metal album. With this album, Pantera moved away from their glam metal years and became a groove metal band, starting the groove metal genre. Pantera continued releasing other influential albums through the 1990s. The band released their album \"Vulgar Display of Power\" in 1992 and, with this album, their music became heavier. Pantera's 1994 album \"Far Beyond Driven\" peaked at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling in 186,000 copies its first week of release. Pantera's albums often would quickly get certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and eventually would get certified platinum. Pantera's album \"Vulgar Display of Power\" is the band's best-selling album, being eventually certified 2x platinum. In 1993, Brazilian thrash metal band Sepultura released \"Chaos A.D.\" and, with this album, the band began using fewer elements of thrash metal. With \"Chaos A.D.\", Sepultura became a groove metal band. Sepultura released their most popular album \"Roots\" in 1996. \"Roots\" was a groove metal and nu metal album. The album received criticism from fans because the album was very different from older Sepultura albums like \"Beneath the Remains\". In 1992, thrash metal band Exhorder moved to the groove metal genre with their album \"The Law\". In the 1990s, several other groove metal bands appeared, including Skinlab, Pissing Razors, Machine Head, Prong, Grip Inc., and White Zombie.\n\nMachine Head released their debut album \"Burn My Eyes\" in 1994. The album helped the band achieve underground success, with the album selling 145,240 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. White Zombie achieved mainstream success in the mid 1990s. In October 1993 and February 1994, the band's album \"\" was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA, respectively. The album was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in July 1998. The album peaked at number 2 on the Heatseekers Albums chart in 1993. White Zombie's music videos were featured on \"Beavis & Butthead\" and this helped the band sell more albums. White Zombie's 1995 album \"\" achieved mainstream success. The album peaked at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 104,000 copies in its first week of release. \"Astro Creep: 2000\" was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. White Zombie's song \"More Human Than Human\" achieved mainstream success in the mid 1990s. It peaked at number 53 on the Radio Songs chart on June 17, 1995. On that day, \"More Human Than Human\" peaked at number 7 on the Alternative Songs chart. On June 10, 1995, the song peaked at number 10 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. \"More Human Than Human\" was played very frequently on MTV and won the Best Metal/Hard Rock Video award at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn the 2000s, many more groove metal bands emerged, including Five Finger Death Punch, Damageplan, Lamb of God, Chimaira, Hellyeah, and Throwdown. Damageplan formed after the breakup of Pantera, with Pantera members Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott being members of Damageplan. Damageplan released one album in 2004 called \"New Found Power\". In December 2004, when the band performed live, guitarist Dimebag Darrell was shot dead by a man named Nathan Gale. After this incident, Damageplan broke up. Dimebag Darrell's brother Vinnie Paul Abbott then became the drummer for Hellyeah in 2006 and remained until his passing in 2018. Lamb of God became popular among heavy metal fans in the mid-2000s along with the metalcore bands that were achieving success at the time. Five Finger Death Punch emerged in the 2000s and achieved moderate success in the 2010s.\n\nGroove metal bands like Pantera, White Zombie, Prong, and Sepultura were all big influences on nu metal. Nu metal was a genre that began in the mid-1990s and became mainstream in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nu metal artists like Kid Rock, Korn, Godsmack, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Staind, Crazy Town, Slipknot, Drowning Pool, P.O.D., Disturbed, and System of a Down all achieved mainstream success.\n\n"}

Comp series sights, such as the CompM2, are the most popular and is currently used by numerous armed forces around the world.\n\nAimpoint AB is a manufacturing company founded in 1974 and is based in Malmö, Sweden. Their primary products are reflector (or reflex) sights, specifically the red dot sight sub-type. In 1975 they introduced their first commercial product, the \"\"Aimpoint Electronic\"\" red dot sight, based on a design by Helsingborg engineer John Arne Ingemund Ekstrand. This is claimed to be the first light-emitting diode \"red dot\" reflector sight ever manufactured. They currently offer many product lines based on this technology as well as accessories. In 1997 Aimpoint was awarded the first multi-year military contract ever for a red dot sighting system when the US Army purchased their Aimpoint CompM2, designated the “M68 Close Combat Optic”.\n\nAimpoint currently sells a large line of red dot sights marketed to hunters, marksmen, law-enforcement agencies, and military organizations all over the world. Nearly 3,000,000 sight are in use world wide today.\n\nAll of their products use non-magnifying optical collimators (reflector or \"reflex\" sights) along with battery powered light-emitting diodes to produce a red aiming point. Many sights utilize a type of mangin mirror system, consisting of a meniscus lens corrector element combined with the semi-reflective mirror (what Aimpoint's advertising calls a \"\"two lens\"\" or \"\"double lens\"\" system), that compensates for spherical aberration, an error that can cause the dot position to diverge off the sight's optical axis with change in eye position. Aimpoint markets their sights as \"parallax free\", but this seems to refer to their off-axis spherical aberration correction system at one optimized distance. Aimpoints, like all other collimated sight systems, induce some parallax at ranges other than the ptimized due to the nature of the collimator.\n\nAimpoints divides its products in to two categories: professional products and commercial (hunting and sport) products. In most Countries Aimpoints has different distributors for commercial and professional sector. \n\nThese models use Aimpoints \"Advanced Circuit Efficiency Technology\" (ACET) diode circuitry, a newer low power consumption system introduced in 2005:\n\n\n\n\nWhile red dot sights like Aimpoint Hunter, 9000, PRO, CompC3 and similar use 30 mm rings for mounting (Hunter 34 models are an exception, since they use 34mm mounting rings), Aimpoint also developed separate mounting standards for some of their red dot sight. Most common are the following.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on November 24, 1999. In the episode, the boys participate in the South Park Civil War reenactment. To win a bet, Cartman convinces the reenactors to try and alter history and leads them throughout the United States. The episode's name is a reference to the war novel \"The Red Badge of Courage\", and parodies Ken Burns' documentary miniseries \"The Civil War\" and the 1993 film \"Gettysburg.\"\n\nAs the men of South Park are preparing to hold their annual American Civil War reenactment of the (fictional) Battle of Tamarack Hill, the children rehearse as a Union Army rally band.\n\nIn the morning of the reenactment, Stan's uncle, Jimbo informs the reenactors that over 200 people will come to see them reenact the battle, setting a new record. He also takes the time to remind everyone that the primary alcohol sponsor of their event is Jagerminz S'more-flavored Schnapps, \"the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.\" In addition, the special guest will be Stan's grandpa, Marvin Marsh. Meanwhile, Cartman comes dressed as General Robert E. Lee, and the boys are outraged by his dressing as a Confederate officer. Evidently under the impression that the reenactment is a competition of some sort, Cartman bets that the South will win the Civil War, and if it does, Stan and Kyle will be his slaves for a month, or vice versa. Knowing that the outcome is supposed to be historical victory for the North as planned, Stan and Kyle eagerly accept the challenge.\n\nCartman manipulates the drunken Confederate reenactors into actually striving to win the reenactment. At the after party, all of the reenactors, Confederate and Unionist, are now drunk on the Schnapps, Cartman rallies them to attack Topeka, which is presumed by the reenactors to have been the next battle. The next day, Topeka is assaulted by the drunken South Park Confederates and the entire town falls. As the invasion continues town by town, their ranks are continually bolstered by either Confederate supporters or men who would simply choose to avoid fighting them. Stan, Kyle, and Grampa Marsh travel to Chattanooga which is under attack by the Confederates. The National Guard also arrives on the scene and shoots a warning flare into the air which kills Kenny (who had joined the Confederates under Cartman's promise of \"lots of plunder and womens\").\n\nThe boys hatch a plan to rid the army of their primary fuel, the S'More Schnapps. The army soon wakes up with raging hangovers and quickly disbands, but Cartman calls the Jägerminz company, who deliver to the entire army truckloads of alcohol. With the men drunk again, the next target of the Confederates is Fort Sumter. Though they easily overrun and secure the fort, they are then faced with the National Guard. The latter is defeated with help from Confederate reinforcements made up of the entire population of South Carolina.\n\nFinally the Confederate Army reaches Washington, D.C.. The army demands the Confederate States of America to be a separate country and blackmail President Clinton by threatening to release a (bluff) video of him with Marisa Tomei. Grandpa, realizing that the drunken men still think that the entire campaign is a reenactment, gets Stan and Kyle dressed up as Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, just in time to prevent President Clinton from signing the surrender, with the added condition that the South receive a free year's supply of Schnapps. The entire army breaks up happily and leaves upon surrender to Cartman's dismay.\n\nStan and Kyle are deciding what to make Cartman do, having won the bet, but their triumph is short-lived. Cartman is saved from the terms of the bet after remembering the North still won the war, and that slavery was abolished because of it. President Clinton makes this clear by pointing out that the abolition of slavery was one of the significant outcomes of the Civil War, making slavery illegal and the bet nullified. Angered by this, Stan and Kyle insult Clinton before walking away, embittered.\n\nAfter the production of the previous episode, the voice actor of many female \"South Park\" roles, Mary Kay Bergman, committed suicide. Parker and Stone, still in shock from her death, did not feel like auditioning people right away, which is why this episode features no female voices (Trey Parker voices the S'mores Schnapps Lady and the schoolteacher in Topeka, and Kenny's mother appears with no speaking parts).\n\nThe episode parodies the film \"Gettysburg\", which Parker and Stone disliked.\n\nIn 2013, fans voted \"The Red Badge of Gayness\" as the best episode of Season 3 on the official \"South Park\" website.\n\n\"The Red Badge of Gayness,\" along with the sixteen other episodes from \"The Complete Third Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 18, 2001. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}

They are a spin-off of the \"Megami Tensei\" series. The first \"Digital Devil Saga\" was released in Japan in 2004, North America in 2005, and Europe in 2006. Its direct sequel, Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2, released in 2005 in Japan and North America, and 2007 in Europe. The games were published in Europe by Ghostlight and in other regions by Atlus and its North American subsidiary Atlus USA.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga\" follows the Embryon, a tribe who fight against six other tribes in a digital world called the Junkyard. After being infected with a demon virus that grants them demonic powers, the Embryon must fight with and devour the other tribes to ascend to \"Nirvana\". During the conflict, they shelter a woman named Sera, who has the power to calm their demonic powers. In \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", having escaped into the devastated real world, the Embryon are caught up in the fight against the Karma Society, who are intimately linked to the source of the disaster. The gameplay of both titles feature third-person navigation of playable characters around to-scale environments, and turn-based gameplay against demonic monsters and human enemies.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga\" began development pre-2002 under the working title \"New Goddess\". The game's concept and original draft were written by Japanese author Yu Godai, who collaborated with Atlus scriptwriter Tadashi Satomi until withdrawing from the project for personal reasons. The gameplay concept of characters transforming into demons was based on an unused idea for \"Shin Megami Tensei\". The second game began development immediately after the first, with the main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for their story, graphics and gameplay. Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise for the story.\n\nIn the \"Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga\" role-playing games, players take control of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in \"Digital Devil Saga 2\". These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a character can learn is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character can learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.\n\nThe \"Digital Devil Saga\" games use a turn-based battle system, with three allied characters fighting in battle. Both player characters and enemies are governed by a mechanic called the Press Turn system: each character has a symbol representing a turn. The character can forfeit a turn to allow the next character an action; turns cannot be passed more than once. If an enemy's weakness is exploited or a character lands a critical hit, an extra turn is gained; if a character resists an attack, a turn is lost. In \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", characters will sometimes enter battle in a half-transformed \"berserk\" mode, which increases attack power while locking away magic skills and lowering a character's defense. While battle is focused around strengthening characters' demon forms, they can also fight in their human forms using conventional weapons, and can equip ammunition. A human character can perform a combo with one in demon form. The magic system uses nine magic attributes. Ice and Lightning magic have a chance of causing the \"freeze\" and \"stun\" status, while Expel magic reduces an enemy's hit points by a certain percentage, and Death magic causes an instant kill. Status magic can inflict status effects on enemies.\n\nEach time a character's experience level raises, they receive stat boosts. While the protagonist can assign stat points at will, the other main characters each have certain specializations. Money is also dropped, which can be used to buy supplies from merchants. Atma is gained after each battle, but a greater amount is gained from eating enemies. If an enemy is \"frightened\", the amount of Atma is further increased. Characters can also be afflicted with a status ailment if they overeat. In \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", special Karma Ring items can be assigned to characters to grant stat boosts. Fitting different gems dropped from defeated enemies granting specific stat boosts and effects. Effects range from granting free status buffs on the player party to casting ailments on enemies. Importing save data from the first game enables some skills and abilities learned during the first game to be transferred to the characters that learned them.\nThe first \"Digital Devil Saga\" takes place in the Junkyard, a combat simulator program divided between six tribes where it always rains: the Embryon, Vanguards, Solids, Maribel, Brutes and Wolves. Each tribe holds a particular territory, and initially are devoid of emotions: the only common ground is a great tower at the Junkyard's center called the Karma Temple, which acts as a meeting place for all the tribe leaders. The following game is set on Earth, which has been devastated by a phenomenon known as the \"Black Sun\", a manifestation of God's anger. The survivors of humanity are ruled by the Karma Society.\n\nThe main protagonists of the \"Digital Devil Saga\" duology are silent protagonist , leader of the Embryon; and , a woman who can commune with God. The other Embryon are the kind ; the hot-tempered the light-hearted ; and the highly logical . The main antagonist is , who is Sera's intersexual biological parent. In \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", two new main characters are introduced: Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group; and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society. All the main characters barring Cuvier become infected with the demon virus, a condition that causes them to turn into demonic beings and lust after human flesh.\n\nDuring a border skirmish between the Embryon and the Vanguards, a demon virus is introduced that infects everyone in the Junkyard: branded with a mark representing their \"Atma\" and gradually awakening to basic emotions, the people of the Junkyard must devour their foes to satiate their demonic hunger or risk going berserk. Sera, a so-called cyber shaman, arrives suffering from amnesia and is taken in by the Embryon, revealing herself capable of calming their hunger with her singing. The Embryon first become conscious of their new powers when they meet the surviving Vanguard: during their time there, they are forced to kill the Vanguards' leader Harley. Serph is then summoned to the Karma Temple along with the surviving tribe leaders. Once they are assembled there, a female being calling itself Angel orders the tribes to conquer their neighbors and ascend the Temple's tower to \"Nirvana\", bringing Sera as proof of their achievements. The Embryon decide to ally with the Maribel as a means of defeating the stronger tribes.\n\nAfter gaining the trust of the Maribel's leader Jinana, they are betrayed by her second-in-command Bat, who allies with the Brutes along with the Solids' leader Mick. Jinana, having refused to eat as she needed to, goes berserk and must be killed. The Solids then capture Sera, leading the Embryon into a fight to the death against Mick. They also successfully trick the Brutes' forces and Bat into a booby-trapped ship, killing them. During this time, the Wolves are subdued by the Brutes, whose leader Varin has awakened memories of a former life where he was known as \"Colonel Beck\", and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Angel to release him from the Junkyard. With help from the Wolves' deposed leader Lupa, the Embryon infiltrate the Brutes' castle, but Lupa is killed after going berserk. Later, the Embryon end up fighting Varin, who accuses Sera of being a monster before he dies. Sera regains her memories and runs to the Karma Temple with the Embryon in pursuit. There, Sera faces the human form of Angel, who threatens to delete the Junkyard with a computer virus if Sera does not return to the real world with her. The Embryon arrive and successfully fight Angel, but in the process release the computer virus. The Embryon, Sera and Angel only just escape as the Junkyard is destroyed.\n\nIn \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", the Embryon appear in the real world, which is slowly being destroyed by the Black Sun: the only ones able to survive the sun's rays are those infected with the demon virus. Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building. While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working with Cuvier on the promise of Sera's safety. Reaching the EGG, a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into the EGG, and God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the EGG. In the process, both Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning to the EGG so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by Heat, who has fused with the EGG and gone berserk. Inside the EGG, Serph is met by a higher being calling itself Schrödinger, who reveals the truth about what happened.\n\nThe Karma Society was founded to study God, who was losing his faith in humanity due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor of a group of children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment populated by benign versions of Karma Society staff: this environment was redesigned to become the Junkyard and the artificial beings would become its five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her. When Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.\n\nProduction on the initial \"Digital Devil Saga\" started prior to the beginning of active development on \"\" in 2002. During production, it was known under the working title \"New Goddess\". The project was formed in part to make the \"Megami Tensei\" series accessible to a broader audience while staying true to its roots. The games were directed by Katsura Hashino, a new director who had worked in lesser roles in previous \"Megami Tensei\" titles. The design director was Makoto Kitano, while the movie director was Ichiroh Itano, a noted anime director. Itano was responsible for storyboarding and character movement choreography. The team was divided into multiple divisions, each in charge of different aspects of the game's design. The battle system was taken from that used in \"Nocturne\", but with elements added to both differentiate it from other \"Megami Tensei\" games and incorporate the game's themes. During development of \"Digital Devil Saga\", the team were faced with repeated problems with fitting the entire experience on a single DVD: the amount of data was estimated to be two times that of \"Nocturne\".\n\nThe original story was written by Japanese novelist Yu Godai. She was contacted in 2000 by Atlus through her then-publisher Kadokawa Shoten about collaborating on a video game scenario, something entirely new to her. Her submitted prporsal for \"Digital Devil Saga\" was accepted, and she temorarily moved to Tokyo to work with Atlus on refining the project. During her time on the project, she collaborated with Tadashi Satomi, who had previously written scripts for the first three \"Persona\" games. Godai wrote her outline on the basis that both books and video games had stories broken into chapters, writing up the story up to the first boss battle in short story form to get a sense of the narrative and lore. Ultimately, due to a number of factors including health problems and disliking living in Tokyo, Godai left the project. Satomi's role as story writer for the duology necessitated discussions with other teams assigned to the game. Due to characters having dialogue in the field, the team needed to have extensive notes prepared.\n\nProduction of \"Digital Devil Saga 2\" began immediately after the release of the first game. To tease it prior to its official announcement, a large number of unfinished plot threads and vague hints relating to the main characters' previous lives were incorporated into the first game. For \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", the team expanded upon the systems implemented in the first game. Due to extra features added, the team sometimes felt that they could not fit it all on a single disc. The main priority was to ensure smooth motion and a quick transfer into battles and cutscenes. The game's setting was inspired in Satomi's mind by the frequent reporting of natural disasters and outbreaks of diseases around the world. Another theme he incorporate was the inherent contradiction of wanting to avoid violence while being forced to fight others in order to survive. According to Satomi, while the first game's motif was \"rain\", the second game's was \"sun\". Itano returned to his role as storyboarder and movement choreographer. A large amount of work was done to refine the gameplay experience, such as opening up the character customization system. The team used player feedback from the first game's systems to make their adjustments. For both games, Atlus received additional development support for artwork assets from Kusanagi Corporation.\n\nThe character and demon designs were done by regular series artist Kazuma Kaneko. At the start, Kaneko was given the instruction to give the characters tribal uniforms instead of normal clothes, and an Atma tattoo somewhere on their body to signify their demon power. The uniforms signified their eternal conflict within the Junkyard. To help bring individuality to the main characters, Kaneko create slight variations in them, such as giving them hoods or capes. The grey tribal uniforms were created so the main characters' key colors would stand out. Serph, as the player character and silent protagonist, was given few personality traits and designed with a stern expression. The aspect that separated him from other silent protagonist within the \"Megami Tensei\" series was that his name was spoken by the other characters rather than chosen by the player. To emphasize the fact that the world of \"Digital Devil Saga\" was unlike the typical setting for \"Megami Tensei\" titles, he gave all the characters hair and eye colors that would be naturally impossible in the real world. The only one not to have a strange hair color was Sera, signifying her unique status. The characters' demon forms were designed to be animal-like, signifying their urge to eat. They were given prominent mouths as demons, as the idea was that they would eat their foes when in demon form. Their eyes were removed as they stood out too much. Each character was designed around a specific elemental theme, which both flowed into the gameplay and matched an individual's personality: an example of this is Heat, who has an angry personality and uses Fire as his primary element.\n\nKaneko was the first to propose the game's concept, which was then worked on by other staff members. The initial game's themes were defined as \"awakening\" and \"change\", referenced in how the characters gradually awoke to their emotions and the static environment of the Junkyard was drastically changed. The Junkyard was designed to emphasize the desperation of the characters during their awakening. The concept behind the demon transformations originated during the development of \"Shin Megami Tensei\". Kaneko, who worked on \"Shin Megami Tensei\", had wanted the game's Chaos Hero to regularly switch between his human and demon forms. The idea did not appear in the finished game, but eventually reemerged and became the base for \"Digital Devil Saga\"s gameplay. The game's character models were created based on development knowledge from \"Nocturne\". Creating the models proved difficult due to the need to extensively use level of detail while staying true Kaneko's distinctive designs. While \"Nocturne\" was defined by its \"static\" feel, the team wanted \"Digital Devil Saga\" to have a feeling of motion to contrast \"Nocturne\". Makoto Kitano was responsible for creating 3D representations of the game's demons, A noted element was the design of Cerberus, which combined elements of the three-headed version first designed for \"\" and the shape of sharks. One of the additional challenges was the fact that it was the first \"Megami Tensei\" title to feature extensive voice acting, inspired by the need to fully express the game's themes and story. Before the official voice actors were cast, Atlus staff provided the characters' voices. Due to the wish to appeal to a wider audience than previous \"Megami Tensei\" games, the proposed amount of violence and graphic imagery was cut down.\n\nThe music for \"Digital Devil Saga\" was composed by Shoji Meguro, who had previously worked on multiple \"Megami Tensei\" games, with some additional tracks for the first game being written by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited storage space of the CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. Using the software, Meguro was able to fit in high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he needed to make some compromises on tracks.\n\nFor the first game, Meguro made heavy use of guitar-based rock music, taking his inspiration from music of the 1960s and 70s. It was meant to represent the vicious new nature of the environment, and of how the main protagonists gradually awoke to their humanity. Tsuchiya was in charge of environmental tracks that deviated from the normal layout and feel of the Junkyard. The game's battle theme, \"Hunting\", was originally going to be the boss theme, but its instrumentation was considered to be wrong and so it was changed to the normal battle theme. For the second game, Meguro changed the original's dark tone to give it a harsher feel and techno instrumentation, reflecting the state of the real world and clashing with the views of the main characters. He also reached out to an external firm to help with fitting in more complicated tracks with less loops, getting round some of the limitations he faced with the first game.\n\nMultiple theme songs were created for the games. The first game's opening theme, \"Pray\", was sung by Sera's voice actress Houko Kuwashima. \"Pray\" also formed the core musical theme for the games. For the North American version, the opening theme was changed to \"Danger\", composed by electronic band Etro Anime. The song, described as a \"melancholy track\", was designed to blend with the constant rain of the Junkyard. The opening theme for \"Digital Devil Saga 2\" was \"Alive\": it was written by Meguro, sung by Kayoko Momota, and had backing vocals by Yumi Kawamura. The ending theme song is \"Time Capsule\" by Japanese singer-songwriter As. The song was used in television commercials advertising the game in Japan, and was the singer's debut single.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga\" first announced in the Japanese director's cut version of \"Nocturne\" in February 2004. The game's formal title had only been decided upon shortly before its reveal. As part of the game's promotion in Japan, entertainer and model Mayuko Iwasa appeared in live-action advertisements in the role of Sera, and promoted the game at events. An eight-megabyte PlayStation 2 memory card was sold that featured artwork of Serph and his demon form. \"Digital Devil Saga 2\" was officially announced at the 2004 Tokyo Game Show. To promote \"Digital Devil Saga 2\", a special DVD containing selected music tracks and movie material was created as an over-the-counter giveaway for the initial print of the game. Both \"Digital Devil Saga\" games were re-released by Atlus in 2006 as part of their \"Atlus Best Collection\" budget release series.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga\" was officially announced for the west at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo for release in the winter of that year. It was subsequently delayed into 2005, and a delux edition which would include a box for containing both \"Digital Devil Saga\" games was announced as a consolation. The second game's release window was officially announced at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, to be published in North America by Atlus USA. The game arrived in stores in North America a week earlier than originally scheduled. Both \"Digital Devil Saga\" games were published in Europe by Ghostlight.\n\nAs the original version featured a cast of well-known anime voice actors, the Atlus USA localization team sought out well-known English voice actors for the dub, and took extra care with syncing the English dialogue with the original characters' lip movements. \"Digital Devil Saga\" was the first \"Megami Tensei\" project to feature an extensive voice acting element. During localization, localization project manager Yu Namba made a spelling error during one of the early cutscenes where the name of Serph's demon form was shown: the demon's name was displayed as \"Varna\", when it was actually \"Varuna\". The error was not spotted until it was too late, and so remained in the game. One of the main concerns was to keep the characters' personalities intact when shifting from Japanese to English dialogue: a cited example of how this change was accomplished was Cielo, who was given a Jamaican accent to express the character's easy-going and friendly personality. After the release of \"Nocturne\", the \"\"Shin Megami Tensei\"\" moniker was attached to the \"Digital Devil Saga\" games to help with marketing.\n\nBy the end of 2004, the first game sold 153,421 units in Japan, coming in at the 81st best-selling title in Japan for that year. The second game sold 90,812 units in Japan by the end of 2005, becoming the 144th best-selling game for 2005. \"Digital Devil Saga\" did not manage to meet its projected sales targets in Japan, and contributed to the company's console division posting a substantial loss for the 2004/2005 financial year, resulting in several staff members being laid off. According to a representative of Atlus USA, the games' sales performances in 2005 were \"absolutely fabulous\". In Europe, it was stated by its publisher that the first game had sold above expectations in the region. Speaking in 2013, a Ghostlight representative said that the \"Digital Devil Saga\" duology had \"met with great success\" in Europe. Upon their re-release on PlayStation Network, the games appeared in the top ten rankings in North America and Europe.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga\" received positive critical reception: aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic show ratings of 80% and 78/100 respectively. General praise went to the story, characters and gameplay. The high difficulty, issues with repetition and pacing, and the cliffhanger ending drew criticism. \"Famitsu\" cited the game's significant shift away from the hardcore mechanics of the main series, positively noting the freedom of character customization. The reviewer for 1UP.com, despite missing the demon fusion systems from earlier \"Megami Tensei\" titles, thoroughly enjoyed the game, calling it \"a great \"Final Fantasy\" alternative\". Jeremy Dunham of IGN said that \"Despite its repetition and unfinished storyline, [\"Digital Devil Saga\"] still has plenty to like\", citing its plot and battle system. GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla said that \"Digital Devil Saga\"s combat and world design made it a compelling title worthy of the \"Shin Megami Tensei\" moniker. RPGamer's Derek Cavin said that \"Digital Devil Saga\" \"manages to be a good game, despite its flaws\". Eurogamer's Rob Fahey said that players expecting a traditional role-playing game would be disappointed, while stating that \"Digital Devil Saga\" delivered a generally positive impression while avoiding many cliches of the RPG genre. John McCarroll of RPGFan generally enjoyed his time with the game despite issues with camera control, praising the positive mixture of gameplay and story elements.\n\n\"Digital Devil Saga 2\" received an even better reception: its aggregate scores from GameRankings and Metacritic were 83% and 83/100 respectively. While critics generally cited a necessity for knowledge of the first game, the story and gameplay were generally cited as an improvement over the original. \"Famitsu\" was again fairly positive, enjoying the story and characters, while also noting the accommodations for first-time players. \"Dengeki PlayStation\" was highly positive about the game, praising its story and gameplay additions, though saying that the two games were a little too similar, and that people who had not played the first game would be confused by the story and character relations. 1UP.com's Shane Bettenhausen said that while the game shared many similarities with its predecessor, it was not as repetitive as other games such as the \".hack\" series, and was still a good game. Masimilla said that \"Digital Devil Saga 2\" had managed to realize the first game's storytelling ambitions, enjoying the experience despite noting some design flaws. Fahey said that the game was \"everything that an excellent sequel should be\", generally praising its mechanical and narrative improvements over \"Digital Devil Saga\". Cavin said that it improved on nearly every aspect of the original game, recommending it to players of RPGs. McCarroll said \"[\"Digital Devil Saga 2\"] is easily the finest game I've had a chance to play this year and stands to be one of the great games of this generation\".\nIn its reviews, RPGFan named both \"Digital Devil Saga\" games as \"Editor's Choice\". In 2011, \"Digital Devil Saga\" and its sequel \"Digital Devil Saga 2\" ended up topping the site's \"Top 20 RPGs of the Last Decade\" list. Kurt Kalata, writing for 1UP.com in an article concerning the controversial content of the \"Megami Tensei\" series, made mention of \"Digital Devil Saga\" due to its examination of the ethics of eating others to survive.\n\nA manga spin-off of \"Digital Devil Saga\" titled \"Digital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner - Shinen no Matou\" was published in Japan in 2005 by Jive. The manga revolves around a separate group of characters within the Junkyard. A five-volume light novels series titled have been authored by Yu Godai in 2011. While she had left the project early, her contract with Atlus enabled her to write her own work based on the premise. The novels are Yu's alternate take on her own story, redone without any of the restrictions involved with a video game narrative.\n\n, a mobile role-playing game, was developed by Interactive Brains for mobile phones and published by Atlus and Bbmf through the Megaten α service. Using gameplay systems similar to the console games, the story is an original narrative set within the \"Digital Devil Saga\" universe: when Serph awakens in an enormous tower with no memories, he and the other Embryon must explore the towers with Sera's help to recover his memories.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981057", "title": "Jack of the United States", "text": "Jack of the United States\n\nThe jack of the United States is a maritime flag representing U.S. nationality, flown on the jackstaff in the bow of U.S. vessels that are moored or anchored. The U.S. Navy is a prime user of jacks for its warships and auxiliaries, but they are also used by non-naval vessels such as ships of the U.S. Coast Guard, the predominantly civilian-manned replenishment and support ships of the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command, the ships of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other U.S. governmental entities. The jack is flown on the bow (front) of a ship and the ensign is flown on the stern (rear) of a ship when anchored or moored. Once under way, the ensign is flown from the main mast and the jack is lowered, removed, and stowed away for future use.\n\nThe design of the U.S. jack has consisted of essentially the canton of the U.S. national flag since the late 1770s, with each subsequent modification to the U.S. national flag's canton being represented in the U.S. jack as well. Occasionally, there have been brief hiatus of that design for commissioned warships to commemorate certain occasions, from 1975 to 1976, in 2000 for submarines and submarine tenders, and again for all warships from 2002 to 2019.\n\nThe oldest commissioned warship in active U.S. naval status (that is, having the longest total period in active status), currently , is the only active U.S. warship flying a different jack than the standard U.S. one, by flying the \"First Navy Jack\". All other active U.S. Navy warships display the Union Jack.\n\nFor most of U.S. history, the primary jack design has been the blue canton with stars (the \"union\") from the U.S. national ensign. The blue fielded, white-starred jack is referred to as the Union Jack, not to be confused with the Union Jack of the United Kingdom, which has the same name but a different design. Like the U.S. ensign, the number of stars on the jack correspond with the number of constituent states the U.S. has. Rules for flying the jack are similar to the national ensign, except that the jack is only worn at the bow when the ship is anchored, made fast or alongside.\n\nFrom September 11, 2002, the U.S. Navy made use of the so-called First Navy Jack. However, the standard U.S. jack (i.e. 50 white stars alternative in columns of four and five defacing a blue field) continued to be used as the jack by vessels of U.S. federal agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, the Military Sealift Command and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps and by U.S. civilian ships and by U.S. yachts. The majority of the U.S. Navy's warships returned to using the U.S. Union Jack on June 4, 2019.\n\nThe jack is flown from the jackstaff from 08:00 to sunset while U.S. Navy ships are moored or at anchor. It is required to be the same size as the union of the ensign being flown from the stern of the ship. It is also flown from the yardarm during a general court-martial or court of inquiry. During times when the ensign is at half mast, the jack is also at half mast. The jack is hoisted smartly and lowered ceremoniously in the same manner as the ensign, however the jack is not dipped when the ensign is dipped.\n\nSome other exceptions to the use of the U.S. Union Jack have occurred in the case of the U.S. Navy, the most prominent being the use of the First Navy Jack by the U.S. Navy in honor of the U.S. founding's bicentennial and for other uses subsequently. For example, following the Bicentennial, in August 1980, use of the First Navy Jack was granted to the active commissioned ship having the longest total period of front-line operational service, said use to be in place of the Union Jack until that ship was decommissioned or transferred to inactive status, whereupon the next such ship in seniority inherits the honor of its use. This use is limited to the oldest \"commissioned\" naval vessel (i.e., an all-military United States Ship <nowiki>[</nowiki>ship prefix USS] versus a part-military/part-civilian crewed United States Naval Ship [ship prefix USNS]) in front-line operational service.\n\nOn June 3, 1999, the Secretary of the Navy also authorized the flying of the Submarine Centennial Jack on all U.S. Navy submarines and submarine tenders during 2000.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, the Chief of Naval Operations directed that U.S. Navy warships fly the U.S. jack again beginning on June 4, 2019. The oldest active U.S. warship flies the First Navy Jack; that ship has been USS \"Blue Ridge\" since 2014.\n"}
{"id": "1981066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981066", "title": "Mosè in Egitto", "text": "Mosè in Egitto\n\nMosè in Egitto (; \"\"Moses in Egypt\"\") is a three-act opera written by Gioachino Rossini to an Italian libretto by Andrea Leone Tottola, which was based on a 1760 play by Francesco Ringhieri, \"L'Osiride\". It premièred on 5 March 1818 at the recently reconstructed Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Italy. \n\nIn 1827 Rossini revised and greatly enlarged the work to a four-act French libretto: Moïse et Pharaon, ou Le passage de la Mer Rouge (; \"\"Moses and Pharaoh, or The Crossing of the Red Sea\"\"). This was written by Luigi Balocchi and Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy. The première took place in the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opera on 26 March that year. \n\nRiccardo Muti and many scholars consider \"Moïse et Pharaon\", along with \"Guillaume Tell\", to be among Rossini's greatest achievements: \n\nMosè in Egitto\", 1818\n\nThe opera was loosely based on the Exodus from Egypt of the Israelites, led by Moses, rendered agreeable to the opera stage by introducing a love theme, in which the Pharaoh's son Amenophis plans to prevent their departure, since he loves the Israelite Anaïs.\n\nThe 1818 opera opens as the plague of darkness is dispelled by Moses' prayer, and it ends with the spectacle of the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh's host, which \"elicited howls of derision\" at the clumsy machinery of its staging at the premiere, though the opera surmounted its technical failings and was a hit. Billed in 1818 as an \"azione tragico-sacra\", the sacred drama with some features of the oratorio circumvented proscriptions of secular dramatic performances during Lent.\n\nRossini slightly revised the opera in 1819, when he introduced Moses' prayer-aria \"Dal tuo stellato soglio\", which became one of the most popular opera pieces of the day and which inspired a set of variations for violin and piano by Niccolò Paganini. Both survive in concert performance.\n\nMoïse et Pharaon\", 1827\n\nThe greatly enlarged work set to a French libretto was composed with so much additional music, including a substantial ballet, as to warrant a new title, Moïse et Pharaon, ou Le passage de la Mer Rouge (\"Moses and Pharaoh, or The Crossing of the Red Sea\") (), and was seen to be a separate and new opera alongside its Naples progenitor.\n\nFrench audiences had already seen \"Mosè in Egitto\" – given its Parisian premiere by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Le Peletier on 20 October 1822 – before Rossini revised it again, this time in French, for the Paris Opéra.\n\nThe French version, in four acts with a ballet, premiered on 26 March 1827 under the title \"Moïse et Pharaon, ou Le Passage de la Mer Rouge\". The first libretto from Naples was translated and augmented by Luigi Balocchi and Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy, who would later co-write the libretto for Rossini's final opera \"Guillaume Tell\". As is noted on Expatia, \"this second version proved such a runaway box-office success that it was performed no less than 100 times between its premiere in 1827 and 1838\".\n\n20th century and beyond\n\nThe Rossini Opera Festival, in Rossini's home town of Pesaro, has presented the opera periodically since 1980, beginning with a 1983 production by Pier Luigi Pizzi and revived in 1985. It did not re-appear until 2011 when it was seen in a production by Graham Vick. There had, however, been concert performances of various versions of the opera in New York by the Collegiate Chorale and the Sacred Opera Society.\n\n\"Mosè\" had \"remained virtually unheard in Britain since a concert in 1822\" , until a production was staged by Welsh National Opera in the 1964/5 season in Cardiff, Llandudno and London. London's Royal Opera House gave it in May/June 1994.\n\nWelsh National Opera staged it again in autumn 2014 in Cardiff and on tour. Opinions were mixed.\n\nIn the US, \"Mosè in Egitto\" had not been heard in Chicago since 1865, but it was presented in that city by Chicago Opera Theater in 2010 and given by New York City Opera in April 2013.\n\nAs \"Moise et Pharaon\" it was given at La Scala in 2003, and again as part of the 2009 Salzburg Festival under Muti.\n\nThe score calls for: 2 Flutes/2 Piccolos, 2 Oboes, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 4 Horns, 2 trumpets, 3 Trombones, Serpent, Timpani, Bass Drum, cymbals, Triangle, \"Banda Turca\", Harp, Strings.\n\nOnstage: Band (Piccolo, Quartino, 4 Clarinets, 2 Horns, 4 Trumpets, 2 Trombones, Serpent, Bass Drum)\n\nDarkness envelopes Egypt. It has been brought about by God in order to punish the Pharaoh and his people because he has failed to allow the Hebrews to leave the country for the Promised Land across the Red Sea. Moses is brought in and the Pharaoh declares that, when the sun shines again, he will release the captives. Cautioned by his brother Aaron not to believe the Egyptian leader, nevertheless Moses pleads to God and light returns.\n\nHowever, because the Pharaoh's son Osiride is in love with the Hebrew girl Elcia and does not want to see her leave with her people, he persuades the High Priest, Mambre, to help him. The Priest does not believe in Moses' powers and he agrees to find a way to prevent the exodus by encouraging the Egyptians to revolt against allowing the Hebrews to depart. The Pharaoh then withdraws his promise and warns Moses that any Hebrew who tries to escape will be killed. Amaltea, Pharaoh's wife, has secretly converted and she tries to intervene, but to no avail. Moses then threatens further punishment and is set upon by Osiride's soldiers, intent upon killing him, but Pharaoh arrives in time to prevent it. Moses then prays for fire to rain down upon the country.\n\nPharaoh orders the Hebrews to leave at once, so as to avoid the curse placed on his people. Then, telling his son that he has negotiated a treaty whereby Osiride will be married to the Princess of Armenia, he does not understand why his son hears his announcement with little enthusiasm.\n\nShortly afterwards, Moses learns that Osiride has kidnapped Elcia, but Aaron knows where they are hiding. Amaltea is warned and accompanies him to find the lovers.\nTogether in the cave, Osiride tells Elcia of his father's plans for him and he suggests that they can live together in hiding in the countryside. The Queen with her guards and Aaron interrupt the two lovers, but they refuse to separate and Osiris declares that he intends to give up the throne.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pharaoh once again reverses himself and states that he will not allow the captives to leave, fearing that the Hebrews will support Egypt's enemies. Outraged, Moses declares that the Crown Prince and all the firstborn males of the country will be hit by a divine lightning strike. Pharaoh orders Moses to be put in chains, and, to protect his son from the prophecy, declares Osiride to be his co-ruler and that he will be the one to proclaim the death sentence on Moses. Elcia then comes forward revealing her relationship with Osiride and begging him to free Moses and his people. She tries to persuade him to accept his destiny and marry the royal princess of Armenia. But Osiride remains adamant and immediately orders that Moses be killed. As he does so, he falls dead from being struck by a bolt of lightning.\n\n\"On the shores of the Red Sea\"\n\nHaving crossed the desert, the Hebrews arrive on the shores of the Red Sea, but find themselves unable to continue their journey to the Promised Land. Leading his people and telling them to wait for God's action, Moses prays. As the advancing Egyptians appear, the Hebrews are panicking, but Moses touches the waters with his staff and the Red Sea opens to provide a pathway to the opposite shore. Following closely behind, the Egyptians, led by Mambre and Pharaoh, enter the gap in the waters but they are swamped by the waves which close over them.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Though Diop is sometimes referred to as an Afrocentrist, he predates the concept and thus was not himself an Afrocentric scholar. However, Diop thought, as it is called, is paradigmatic to Afrocentricity. His work was greatly controversial and throughout his career, Diop argued that there was a shared cultural continuity across African peoples that was more important than the varied development of different ethnic groups shown by differences among languages and cultures over time.\n\nDiop's work has posed important questions about the cultural bias inherent in scientific research. Cheikh Anta Diop University (formerly known as the University of Dakar), in Dakar, Senegal, is named after him.\n\nDiop's works have been criticized as revisionist and pseudohistorical. According to Marnie Hughes-Warrington, Diop's works were criticised by leading French Africanists, but they (and later critics) noted the value of his works for the generation of a \"politically useful mythology\", that would promote African unity.\n\nBorn in Thieytou, Diourbel Region, Senegal, Diop was born to an aristocratic Muslim Lebu family in Senegal where he was educated in a traditional Islamic school. Diop's family was part of the Mouride brotherhood, the only independent Muslim fraternity in Africa according to Diop. He obtained the colonial equivalent of the metropolitan French baccalauréat in Senegal before moving to Paris to study for a degree.\nIn 1946, at the age of 23, Diop went to Paris to study. He initially enrolled to study higher mathematics, but then enrolled to study philosophy in the Faculty of Arts of the Sorbonne. He gained his first degree (licence) in philosophy in 1948, then enrolled in the Faculty of Sciences, receiving two diplomas in chemistry in 1950.\n\nIn 1949, Diop registered a proposed title for a Doctor of Letters thesis, \"The Cultural Future of African thought,\" under the direction of Professor Gaston Bachelard. In 1951 he registered a second thesis title \"Who were the pre-dynastic Egyptians\" under Professor Marcel Griaule. He completed his thesis on pre-dynastic Egypt in 1954 but could not find a jury of examiners for it: he later published many of his ideas as the book \"Nations nègres et culture\". In 1956 he re-registered a new proposed thesis for Doctor of Letters with the title \"The areas of matriarchy and patriarchy in ancient times.\" From 1956, he taught physics and chemistry in two Paris lycees as an assistant master, before moving to the College de France. In 1957 he registered his new thesis title \"Comparative study of political and social systems of Europe and Africa, from Antiquity to the formation of modern states.\" The new topics did not relate to ancient Egypt but were concerned with the forms of organisation of African and European societies and how they evolved. He obtained his doctorate in 1960.\n\nIn 1953, he first met Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Marie Curie's son-in-law, and in 1957 Diop began specializing in nuclear physics at the Laboratory of Nuclear Chemistry of the College de France which Frederic Joliot-Curie ran until his death in 1958, and the Institut Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He ultimately translated parts of Einstein's Theory of Relativity into his native Wolof.\n\nAccording to Diop's own account, his education in Paris included History, Egyptology, Physics, Linguistics, Anthropology, Economics, and Sociology. In Paris, Diop studied under André Aymard, professor of History and later Dean of the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris and he said that he had \"gained an understanding of the Greco-Latin world as a student of Gaston Bachelard, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, André Leroi-Gourhan, and others\". Diop said that he \"acquired proficiency in such diverse disciplines as rationalism, dialectics, modern scientific techniques, prehistoric archeology and so on.\" Diop also claimed to be \"the only Black African of his generation to have received training as an Egyptologist\" and \"more importantly\" he \"applied this encyclopedic knowledge to his researches on African history.\"\n\nIn 1948 Diop edited with Madeleine Rousseau, a professor of art history, a special edition of the journal \"Musée vivant\", published by the Association populaire des amis des musées (APAM). APAM had been set up in 1936 by people on the political left wing to bring culture to wider audiences. The special edition of the journal was on the occasion of the centenary of the abolition of slavery in the French colonies and aimed to present an overview of issues in contemporary African culture and society. Diop contributed an article to the journal: \"Quand pourra-t-on parler d'une renaissance africaine\" (When we will be able to speak of an African Renaissance?). He examined various fields of artistic creation, with a discussion of African languages, which, he said, would be the sources of regeneration in African culture. He proposed that African culture should be rebuilt on the basis of ancient Egypt, in the same way that European culture was built upon the legacies of ancient Greece and Rome. In his 1954 thesis, Diop argued that ancient Egypt had been populated by Black people. He specified that he used the terms \"negro\", \"black\", \"white\" and \"race\" as \"immediate givens\" in the Bergsonian sense, and went on to suggest operational definitions of these terms. He said that the Egyptian language and culture had later been spread to West Africa. When he published many of his ideas as the book \"Nations nègres et culture\" (\"Negro Nations and Culture\"), it made him one of the most controversial historians of his time.\n\nDiop had since his early days in Paris been politically active in the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA), an African nationalist organisation led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. He was general secretary of the RDA students in Paris from 1950 to 1953. Under his leadership the first post-war pan-African student congress was organized in 1951. Importantly it included not only francophone Africans, but English-speaking ones as well. The RDA students continued to be highly active in politicizing the anti-colonial struggle and popularized the slogan \"National independence from the Sahara to the Cape, and from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.\" The movement identified as a key task restoring the African national consciousness, which they argued had been warped by slavery and colonialism. Diop, inspired by the efforts of Aimé Césaire toward these ends, but not being a literary man himself, took up the call to rebuild the African personality from a strictly scientific, socio-historical perspective. He was keenly aware of the difficulties that such a scientific effort would entail and warned that \"It was particularly necessary to avoid the pitfall of facility. It could seem to tempting to delude the masses engaged in a struggle for national independence by taking liberties with scientific truth, by unveiling a mythical, embellished past. Those who have followed us in our efforts for more than 20 years know now that this was not the case and that this fear remained unfounded.\" Diop was highly critical of \"the most brilliant pseudo-revolutionary eloquence that ignores the need\" for rebuilding the African national consciousness \"which must be met if our people are to be reborn culturally and politically.\"\n\nDiop believed that the political struggle for African independence would not succeed without acknowledging the civilizing role of the African, dating from ancient Egypt. He singled out the contradiction of \"the African historian who evades the problem of Egypt\".\n\nIn 1960, upon his return to Senegal, he continued what would be a lifelong political struggle. Diop would in the course of over 25 years found three political parties that formed the major opposition in Senegal. The first, \"Le Bloc des Masses Sénégalaises\" (BMS), was formed in 1961. By 1962 Diop's party working on the ideas enumerated in \"Black Africa: the economic and cultural basis for a federated state\" became a serious threat to the regime of then President Léopold Senghor. Diop was subsequently arrested and thrown in jail where he nearly died. The party was shortly thereafter banned for opposing Senghor's efforts to consolidate power in his own hands.\n\n\"Black Africa: the economic and cultural basis for a federated state\" is the book that best expresses Diop's political aims and objectives. In it he argues that only a united and federated African state will be able to overcome underdevelopment. He proposed that a single African language be used across the continent for official, educational, and cultural purposes. This critical work constitutes a rational study of not only Africa's cultural, historic and geographic unity, but of Africa's potential for energy development and industrialization. Diop argues for the need to build a capable continental army, able to defend the continent and its people and proposes a plan for the development of Africa's raw materials and industrialization. All these factors combined, based on the formation of a federated and unified Africa, culturally and otherwise, are surmised to be the only way for Africa to become the power in the world that she should rightfully be.\n\nAfter the B.M.S. was dissolved, Diop and other former members reconstituted themselves under a new party, the Front National Sénégalais (FNS) in 1963. The party, though not officially recognized, continued strong political activity along the same lines as the BMS. Under significant political pressure president Senghor attempted to appease Diop by offering him and his supporters a certain numbers of government positions. Diop strongly refused to enter into any negotiations until two conditions were met. First, that all political prisoners be released, and, secondly, that discussions be opened on government ideas and programs, not on the distribution of government posts. In protest at the refusal of the Senghor administration to release political prisoners, Diop remained largely absent from the political scene from 1966 to 1975.\n\nAfter 1960, Diop went back to Senegal and continued his research and political career. He established and was the director of the radiocarbon laboratory at the IFAN (Institut Fondamental de l'Afrique Noire). Diop dedicated a book about the IFAN radiocarbon laboratory \"to the memory of my former professor Frédéric Joliot who welcomed me into his laboratory at the College de France.\" (After his death the university was named in his honor: Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar.) He had said, \"In practice it is possible to determine directly the skin color and, hence, the ethnic affiliations of the ancient Egyptians by microscopic analysis in the laboratory; I doubt if the sagacity of the researchers who have studied the question has overlooked the possibility.\"\n\nDiop published his technique and methodology for a melanin dosage test in the Bulletin of Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire. In the July 1973 paper entitled \"La pigmentation des anciens Égyptiens. Test par la mélanine,\" Diop described the technique used to determine the melanin content of Egyptian mummies.\n\nSome critics have argued that Diop's melanin dosage test technique lacks sufficient evidence. They contend the test is inappropriate to apply to ancient Egyptian mummies, due to the effects of embalming and deterioration over time.\n\nIn 1974, Diop was one of about 20 participants in a UNESCO symposium in Cairo, where he presented his theories to specialists in Egyptology. This symposium generated a lively debate about, but no consensus on, Diop's theories. His forceful assertions that the original population of the Nile Delta was black and that Egyptians remained black-skinned until Egypt lost its independence, \"was criticized by many participants\". Diop also wrote a chapter entitled \"Origin of the ancient Egyptians\", in the UNESCO \"General History of Africa\". However, Diop's contribution was subject to the editorial comment that \"The arguments put forward in this chapter have not been accepted by all the experts interested in the problem\".\n\nDiop's first work translated into English, \"The African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality\", was published in 1974. It gained a much wider audience for his work. He asserted that archaeological and anthropological evidence supported his view that Pharaohs were of Negroid origin. Some scholars draw heavily from Diop's groundbreaking work, while others in the Western academic world do not accept his theories. Diop's work has posed important questions about the cultural bias inherent in scientific research.\n\nDiop argued above all that European archaeologists before and after the decolonization had understated and continued to understate the extent and possibility of Black civilizations.\n\nThe Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet's discoveries at the site of Kerma shed some light on the theories of Diop. They show close cultural links between Nubia and Ancient Egypt, though the relationship had been acknowledged for years. This does not necessarily imply a genetic relationship, however. Mainstream Egyptologists such as F. Yurco note that among peoples outside Egypt, the Nubians were closest ethnically to the Egyptians, shared the same culture in the predynastic period, and used the same pharaonoic political structure. He suggests that the peoples of the Nile Valley were one regionalized population, sharing a number of genetic and cultural traits.\n\nDiop argued that there was a shared cultural continuity across African peoples that was more important than the varied development of different ethnic groups shown by differences among languages and cultures over time.\n\nDiop supported his arguments with references to ancient authors such as Herodotus and Strabo. For example, when Herodotus wished to argue that the Colchian people were related to the Egyptians, he said that the Colchians were \"black, with curly hair\" Diop used statements by these writers to illustrate his theory that the ancient Egyptians had the same physical traits as modern black Africans (skin colour, hair type). His interpretation of anthropological data (such as the role of matriarchy) and archeological data led him to conclude that Egyptian culture was a Black African culture. In linguistics, he believed in particular that the Wolof language of contemporary West Africa is related to ancient Egyptian.\n\nDiop's early condemnation of European bias in his 1954 work \"Nations Negres et Culture,\" and in \"Evolution of the Negro World\" has been supported by some later scholarship. Diop's view that the scholarship of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century was based on a racist view of Africans was regarded as controversial when he wrote in the 1950s through to the early 1970s, the field of African scholarship still being influenced by Carleton S. Coon and others. Coon used racial rankings of inferiority and superiority, defined \"true Blacks\" as only those of cultures south of the Sahara, and grouped some Africans with advanced cultures with Caucasian clusters. Based on Coon's work, the Hamitic Hypothesis held that most advanced progress or cultural development in Africa was due to the invasions of mysterious Caucasoid Hamites. Similarly, the Dynastic Race Theory of Egypt asserted that a mass migration of Caucasoid peoples was needed to create the Egyptian kingships, as slower-witted Negro tribes were incapable. Genetic studies have disproved these notions. A 2004 review of DNA research in \"African Archaeological Review\" supports some of Diop's criticisms. It found that some European researchers had earlier tried to make Africans seem a special case, somehow different from the rest of the world's population flow and mix. This seemed to apply in matters both of evolution and gene pool makeup. The reviewers found that some researchers seemed to have shifted their categories and methods to maintain this \"special case\" outlook.\n\nDiop consistently held that Africans could not be pigeonholed into a rigid type that existed somewhere south of the Sahara, but they varied widely in skin color, facial shape, hair type, height, and a number of additional factors, just like other human populations. In his \"Evolution of the Negro World\" in \"Présence Africaine\" (1964), Diop castigated European scholars who posited a separate evolution of various types of humankind and denied the African origin of \"homo sapiens\".\n\nCritics of Diop cite a 1993 study that found the ancient Egyptians to be more related to North African, Somali, European, Nubian and, more remotely, Indian populations, than to Sub-Saharan Africans. Diop always maintained that Somalians, Nubians, Ethiopians and Egyptians were all part of a related range of African peoples in the Nilotic zone that also included peoples of the Sudan and parts of the Sahara. He said that their cultural, genetic and material links could not be defined away or separated into a regrouped set of racial clusters. Critics of this study in turn hold that it achieves its results by manipulation of data clusters and analysis categories, casting a wide net to achieve generic, general statistical similarities with populations such as Europeans and Indians. At the same time, the statistical net is cast much more narrowly in the case of 'blacks', carefully defining them as an extreme type south of the Sahara and excluding related populations like Somalians, Nubians and Ethiopians, as well as the ancient Badarians, a key indigenous group.\n\nIt is held by Keita et al. that when the data are looked at \"in toto\", without the clustering manipulation and selective exclusions above, then a more accurate and realistic picture emerges of African diversity. For example, ancient Egyptian matches with Indians and Europeans are generic in nature (due to the broad categories used for matching purposes with these populations) and are not due to gene flow. Ancient Egyptians such as the Badarians show greater statistical affinities to tropical African types and are not identical to Europeans. As regards the key Badarian group, a 2005 study by anthropologist S. O. Y. Keita of Badarian crania in predynastic upper Egypt found that the predynastic Badarian series clusters much closer with the tropical African series than European samples.\n\nDiop's theory on variability is also supported by a number of scholars mapping human genes using modern DNA analysis. This has shown that most of human genetic variation (some 85–90%) occurs within localized population groups, and that race only can account for 6–10% of the variation. Arbitrarily classifying Maasai, Ethiopians, Shillouk, Nubians, etc., as Caucasian is thus problematic, since all these peoples are northeast African populations and show normal variation well within the 85–90% specified by DNA analysis. Modern physical anthropologists also question splitting of peoples into racial zones. They hold that such splitting is arbitrary insertion of data into pre-determined pigeonholes and the selective grouping of samples.\n\nDiop's arguments to place Egypt in the cultural and genetic context of Africa met a wide range of condemnation and rejection. He did not publish his work in subject-specific journals with an independent editorial board that practiced the system of peer review. He declined to seek the opinion of other scholars and answer their criticism, although this is the normal procedure in academic debate. His research has become under-regarded because he did not accept this academic discipline.\n\nScholars such as Bruce Trigger condemned the often shaky scholarship on such northeast African peoples as the Egyptians. He declared that the peoples of the region were all Africans, and decried the \"bizarre and dangerous myths\" of previously biased scholarship, \"marred by a confusion of race, language, and culture and by an accompanying racism.\" Trigger's conclusions were supported by Egyptologist Frank Yurco, who viewed the Egyptians, Nubians, Ethiopians, Somalians, etc. as one localized Nile valley population. He did not believe that such a population needed to be arbitrarily split into tribal or racial clusters.\n\nA book chapter by archeologist Kevin MacDonald, published in 2004, argued that there is little basis for positing a close connection between Dynastic Egypt and the African interior. Nevertheless, he awarded Diop and similar scholars credit for posing these problems.\n\nOne of Diop's most controversial issues centers on the definition of who is a true Black person. Diop insisted on a broad interpretation similar to that used in classifying European populations as white.\n\nHe alleged his critics were using the narrowest possible definition of \"Blacks\" in order to differentiate various African groups such as Nubians into a European or Caucasoid racial zone. Under the \"true negro\" approach, Diop contended that those peoples who did not meet the stereotypical classification were attributed to mixture with outside peoples, or were split off and assigned to Caucasoid clusters.\n\nHe also stated that opponents were hypocritical in stating that the race of Egyptians was not important to define, but they did not hesitate to introduce race under new guises. For instance, Diop suggested that the uses of terminology like \"Mediterranean\" or \"Middle Eastern\", or statistically classifying all who did not meet the \"true\" Black stereotype as some other race, were all attempts to use race to differentiate among African peoples.\n\nDiop's presentation of his concepts at the Cairo UNESCO symposium on \"The peopling of ancient Egypt and the deciphering of the Meroitic script\", in 1974, argued that there were inconsistencies and contradictions in the way African data was handled. This argument remains a hallmark of Diop's contribution. As one scholar at the 1974 symposium put it:\nA majority of academics disavow the term \"black\" for the Egyptians, but there is no consensus on substitute terminology. Some modern studies use DNA to define racial classifications, while others condemn this practice as selective filling of pre-defined, stereotypical categories.\n\nDiop's concept was of a fundamentally Black population that incorporated new elements over time, rather than mixed-race populations crossing arbitrarily assigned racial zones. Many academics reject the term \"black\", however, or use it exclusively in the sense of a sub-Saharan type. One approach that has bridged the gap between Diop and his critics is the non-racial bio-evolutionary approach. This approach is associated with scholars who question the validity of race as a biological concept. They consider the Egyptians as (a) simply another Nile valley population or (b) part of a continuum of population gradation or variation among humans that is based on indigenous development, rather than using racial clusters or the concept of admixtures. Under this approach, racial categories such as \"Blacks\" or \"Caucasoids\" are discarded in favor of localized populations showing a range of physical variation. This way of viewing the data rejected Diop's insistence on Blackness, but at the same time it acknowledged the inconsistency with which data on African peoples were manipulated and categorized.\n\nBefore Diop, the general view, following Charles Seligman on the influence of Egypt on Black Africa was that elements of Egyptian religious thought, customs and technology diffused along four trade routes: up the White Nile; along the North African coast past Tunis to West Africa; up the Blue Nile and along the foothills of Abyssinia to the Great Lakes and through Darfur and along the southern edge of the Sahara. Seligman's views on direct diffusion from Egypt are not generally supported to-day, but were current when Diop started to write and may explain his wish to show that Egyptian and Black Africa culture had a common source, rather than that Egyptian influence was one way.\n\nDiop never asserted, as some claim, that all of Africa follows an Egyptian cultural model. Instead he claims Egypt as an influential part of a \"southern cradle\" of civilization, an indigenous development based on the Nile Valley. While Diop holds that the Greeks learned from a superior Egyptian civilization, he does not argue that Greek culture is simply a derivative of Egypt. Instead he views the Greeks as forming part of a \"northern cradle\", distinctively growing out of certain climatic and cultural conditions. His thought is thus not the \"Stolen Legacy\" argument of writers such as George James or the \"Black Athena\" notions of Martin Bernal. Diop focuses on Africa, not Greece.\n\nDiop attempted to demonstrate that the African peoples shared certain commonalities, including language roots and other cultural elements like regicide, circumcision, totems, etc. These, he held, formed part of a tapestry that laid the basis for African cultural unity, which could assist in throwing off colonialism. His cultural theory attempted to show that Egypt was part of the African environment as opposed to incorporating it into Mediterranean or Middle Eastern venues.\n\nThese concepts are laid out in Diop's \"Towards the African Renaissance: Essays in Culture and Development, 1946–1960\", and \"The Cultural Unity of Black Africa: The Domains of Patriarchy and of Matriarchy in Classical Antiquity,\", These concepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n\"Southern Cradle-Egyptian Model: \"\n\n\"Northern Cradle-Greek Model: \"\n\n\"Zones of Confluence:\" Meeting or mingling area for the two cradles above\n\nMost anthropologists see commonalities in African culture but only in a very broad, generic sense, intimately linked with economic systems, etc. There are common patterns such as circumcision, matriarchy etc., but whether these are part of a unique, gentler, more positive \"Southern cradle\" of peoples, versus a more grasping, patriarchal-flavored \"Northern cradle\" are considered problematic by many scholars, as is grouping the complexity of human cultures into two camps. Extremely warlike peoples, for example, the Zulu, appear frequently in the \"Southern Cradle\". Many cultures the world over show similar developments and a mixture of traits.\n\nAnalyses of other scholars (Hiernaux 1975, Keita, 1990 et al.) eschew \"southern\" and \"northern\" camps and point to a narrower focus that demonstrates cultural, material and genetic connections between Egypt and other nearby African (Nubian, Saharan, and Sudanic) populations. These connections appear not only in linguistics, (see \"Languages demonstrating\" section below) but in cultural areas such as religion. As regards Egyptian religion for example, there appear to be more solid connections with the cultures of the Sudan and northeast Africa than Mesopotamia, according to mainstream research:\n\nDiop considered that it was politically important to demonstrate the cultural and linguistic unity of Africa, and to base this unity on the Egyptian past. He rejected early 20th century theories that confused race and language, such as those advanced by the linguist Carl Meinhof and the anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman. Seligman's Hamitic hypothesis stated that: \"... the civilizations of Africa are the civilizations of the Hamites, its history the record of these peoples and of their interaction with the two other African stocks, the Negro and the Bushman, whether this influence was exerted by highly civilized Egyptians or…pastoralists ...The incoming Hamites were pastoral 'Europeans'-arriving wave after wave – better armed as well as quicker witted than the dark agricultural Negroes.\"\n\nThe 1957 and 1966 editions of Seligman's \"Races of Africa\" retained this statement, and many anthropologists accepted the Hamitic hypothesis into the 1960s. However, from the 1930s archaeologists and historians re-discovered such past African achievements as Great Zimbabwe, and from the 1940s linguists started to demonstrate the flaws in the hypothesis. Joseph Greenberg rejected Meinhof's and Seligman's views on \"Hamite\" cultural history, and argued that the term \"Hamite\" should be completely abandoned, and replaced in linguistics by Afroasiatic languages for the family of five coordinate branches (Semitic, Berber, Ancient Egyptian, Cushitic and Chadic), all of which but the Chadic languages had long been recognised as one group. Greenberg's complete reclassification of the non-intrusive languages of Africa into four families and many sub-families placed Wolof in the West Atlantic sub-family of the Niger-Congo languages family, and he rejected earlier attempts to argue that the languages of negro Africa comprise a genetic unity and derived from dialects spoken around Egypt from 1000 B.C. or earlier.\n\nDiop took an innovative approach in his linguistic researches published in 1977, outlining his hypothesis of the unity of indigenous African languages beginning with the Ancient Egyptian language. He claimed this put African historical linguistics on a secure basis for the first time. He did not subdivide what he termed the langues négro-africaines into subgroups or suggest a family-tree for them, but implicitly rejected the language relations proposed by earlier linguists from Meinhof to Greenberg, who are not mentioned in his bibliography. Diop devoted most of his study to the structural resemblances between one modern African language, Wolof, and Ancient Egyptian, adding some references to other modern languages.\n\nThe same method was applied by four of Diop's collaborators to Mbosi, Duala, Basa, Fula and a few other languages. Théophile Obenga used this method to distinguish Berber from other African members of Greenberg's Afroasiatic family, particularly Egyptian and Coptic. Obenga expressly rejected Greenberg's division of most African languages into the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic families, treating all African languages except the Khoisan languages and Berber as a single unit, négro-africain. Ngom and Obenga both eliminated the Asian Semitic and African Berber members of Greenberg's Afroasiatic family from the négro-africain family: Ngom added that the Bantu languages have more in common with Ancient Egyptian than do the Semitic ones. Diop has endorsed the work of Obenga.\n\nThe linguistic research of Diop and his school have been criticised by Henry Tourneax, a linguist specialising in the Fula language. Tourneax notes that Diop accused previous linguists of being unscientific and obscuring the truth. Tourneax's main criticisms are that many words in the lists used to make comparisons may have been loaned from unrelated languages (including modern Arabic), many of the claimed resemblances are far-fetched and that, when Diop transliterated Wolof words on the principles applied to Ancient Egyptian writings, he distorted them.\n\nDiop's own Wolof studies were examined by Russell Schuh, a specialist in the Chadic languages, who found little resemblance or connection between many of the Wolof etymologies cited by Diop and Egyptian, of the type that are found when comparing Wolof to a known related language like Fula. He concluded that Diop had assumed Egyptian and Wolof were related and then looked for ways to connect their features, disregarding evidence from other languages which might cast doubt on the resemblances claimed. Finally, Schur argued that, if the human species originated in Africa and it created human language, then all human languages have an African origin and are therefore related. Ancient Egyptian and the négro-africain languages such as Wolof are related, but any common origin may be very remote and their relation may not be close. Conversely, Ancient Egyptian may be more closely related to languages that cannot be classed as black and/or African than to many négro-africain languages. In trying to remove Berber and Semitic languages from Greenberg's Afroasiatic family and ignoring real differences between African language groups, Diop and his collaborators have created an artificial language group.\n\nModern linguistic analysis places the origin of the Afro-Asiatic languages in northeast Africa, and plausibly puts the origin of the Egyptian language in the Nile valley, between the apex of the Delta and the First of the Cataracts of the Nile.\n\nWhile acknowledging the common genetic inheritance of all humankind and common evolutionary threads, Diop identified a black phenotype, stretching from India, to Australia to Africa, with physical similarities in terms of dark skin and a number of other characteristics. In an interview in 1985, Diop argued that race was a relevant category and that phenotype or physical appearance is what matters in historic social relations. If we speak only of genotype, I can find a black who, at the level of his chromosomes, is closer to a Swede than Peter Botha is. But what counts in reality is the phenotype. It is the physical appearance which counts. This black, even if on the level of his cells he is closer to a Swede than Peter Botha, when he is in South Africa he will still live in Soweto. Throughout history, it has been the phenotype which has been at issue, we mustn't lose sight of this fact. The phenotype is a reality, physical appearance is a reality. And this appearance corresponds to something which makes us say that Europe is peopled by white people, Africa is peopled by black people, and Asia is people by yellow people. It is these relationships which have played a role in history.\"\n\nAcademic detractors charge Diop with racism, based particularly on his claim that the ancient Egyptians were black. Defenders maintain that Diop's critics routinely misrepresent his views, typically defining negroes as a 'true' type south of the Sahara to cast doubt on his work, It has been claimed that questions such as \"were the ancient Egyptians black?\" are typically misrepresented and framed in these stereotypical terms, so as to quickly dismiss his work and avoid engaging it point by point. Diop by contrast in his \"African Origin of Civilization\", argues against the European stereotypical conception. He holds that the range of peoples and phenotypes under the designation \"negre\" included those with a wide range of physical variability, from light brown skin and aquiline noses to jet black skin and frizzy hair, well within the diversity of peoples of the Nilotic region. Diop also acknowledged that the ancient Egyptians absorbed \"foreign\" genes at various times in their history (the Hyksos for example) but held that this admixture did not change their essential ethnicity.\n\nDiop also appeared to express doubts about the concept of race. At a UNESCO colloquium in Athens in 1981, he asserted: \"I don't like to use the notion of race (which does not exist)... We must not attach an obsessional importance to it. It is a hazard of the evolution.\" This outlook was unlike many of the contemporary white writers he questioned. Indeed, he eschewed racial chauvinism, arguing: \"We apologise for returning to notions of race, cultural heritage, linguistic relationship, historical connections between peoples, and so on. I attach no more importance to these questions than they actually deserve in modern twentieth-century societies.\"\n\nDiop repudiated racism or supremacist theories, arguing for a more balanced view of African history than he felt it was getting during his era. Since he struggled against how racial classifications were used by the European academy in relation to African peoples, much of his work has a strong 'race-flavored' tint. A number of individuals such as US college professor Leonard Jeffries have advanced a more chauvinist view, citing Diop's work.\n\nDiop's fundamental criticism of scholarship on the African peoples was that classification schemes pigeonholed them into categories defined as narrowly as possible, while expanding definitions of Caucasoid groupings as broadly as possible. He held that this was both hypocrisy and bad scholarship, that ignored the wide range of indigenous variability of African peoples.\n\nDiop held that despite the Sahara, the genetic, physical and cultural elements of indigenous African peoples were both in place and always flowed in and out of Egypt, noting transmission routes via Nubia and the Sudan, and the earlier fertility of the Sahara. More contemporary critics assert that notions of the Sahara as a dominant barrier in isolating sub-Saharan populations are both flawed and simplistic in broad historical context, given the constant movement of people over time, the fluctuations of climate over time (the Sahara was once very fertile), and the substantial representation of \"sub Saharan\" traits in the Nile Valley among people like the Badari.\n\nThe entire region shows a basic unity based on both the Nile and Sahara, and cannot be arbitrarily diced up into pre-assigned racial zones. As Egyptologist Frank Yurco notes:\n\nDiop held that scholarship in his era isolated extreme stereotypes as regards African populations, while ignoring or downplaying data on the ground showing the complex linkages between such populations. Modern critics of the racial clustering approach coming after Diop echo this objection, using data from the oldest Nile Valley groupings as well as current peoples. This research has examined the ancient Badarian group, finding not only cultural and material linkages with those further south but physical correlations as well, including a southern modal cranial metric phentoype indicative of the Tropical African in the well-known Badarian group.\n\nSuch tropical elements were thus in place from the earliest beginnings of Egyptian civilization, not isolated somewhere South behind the Saharan barrier. This is considered to be an indigenous development based on microevolutionary principles (climate adaptation, drift and selection) and not the movement of large numbers of outside peoples into Egypt.\n\nAs regards living peoples, the pattern of complexity repeats itself, calling into question the merging and splitting methods of Jensen, et al. Research in this area challenges the groupings used as (a) not reflecting today's genetic diversity in Africa, or (b) an inconsistent way to determine the racial characteristics of the Ancient Egyptians. Studies of some inhabitants of Gurna, a population with an ancient cultural history, in Upper Egypt, illustrate the point. In a 2004 study, 58 native inhabitants from upper Egypt were sampled for mtDNA.\n\nThe conclusion was that some of the oldest native populations in Egypt can trace part of their genetic ancestral heritage to East Africa. Selectively lumping such peoples into arbitrary Mediterranean, Middle Eastern or Caucasoid categories because they do not meet the narrow definition of a \"true\" type, or selectively defining certain traits like aquiline features as Eurasian or Caucasoid, ignores the complexity of the DNA data on the ground. Critics note that similar narrow definitions are not attempted with groups often classified as Caucasoid.\n\"Our results suggest that the Gurna population has conserved the trace of an ancestral genetic structure from an ancestral East African population, characterized by a high M1 haplogroup frequency. The current structure of the Egyptian population may be the result of further influence of neighbouring populations on this ancestral population\"\n\nDiop disputed sweeping definitions of mixed races in relation to African populations, particularly when associated with the Nile Valley. He acknowledged the existence of \"mixed\" peoples over the course of African history, writing that Egyptians and Jews were the product of crossbreeding. Diop also argued for indigenous variants already \"in situ\" as opposed to massive insertions of Hamites, Mediterraneans, Semites or Cascasoids into ancient groupings. Mixed-race theories have also been challenged by contemporary scholars in relation to African genetic diversity. These researchers hold that they too often rely on a stereotypical conception of pure or distinct races that then go on to intermingle. However such conceptions are inconsistently applied when it comes to African peoples, where typically, a \"true negro\" is identified and defined as narrowly as possible, but no similar attempt is made to define a \"true white\". These methods it is held, downplay normal geographic variation and genetic diversity found in many human populations and have distorted a true picture of African peoples.\n\nKeita and Kittles (1999) argue that modern DNA analysis points to the need for more emphasis on clinal variation and gradations that are more than adequate to explain differences between peoples rather than pre-conceived racial clusters. Variation need not be the result of a \"mix\" from categories such as Negroid or Caucasoid, but may be simply a contiuum of peoples in that region from skin color, to facial features, to hair, to height. The present of aquiline features for example, may not be necessarily a result of race mixture with Caucasoids, but simply another local population variant in situ. On a bigger scale, the debate reflects the growing movement to minimize race as a biological construct in analyzing the origins of human populations.\n\nIn summary, modern anthropological and DNA scholarship repeats and confirms many of the criticisms made by Diop as regards to arbitrary classifications and splitting of African peoples, and confirms the genetic linkages of Nile Valley peoples with other African groups, including East Africa, the Sahara, and the Sudan. This modern research also confirms older analyses, (Arkell and Ucko 1956, Shaw 1976, Falkenburger 1947, Strouhal 1971, Blanc 1964, et al.,). This same modern scholarship however in turn challenges aspects of Diop's work, particularly his notions of a worldwide black phenotype.\n\nPerhaps Diop's most notable idea is his insistence in placing Nile Valley peoples in their local and African context, drawing a picture of a stable, ancient population deriving much of its genetic inheritance from that context, as opposed to attempts to split, cluster, subdivide, define and regroup them into other contexts. Such a vision of inherent unity and continuity, ironically, is also supported in part by modern mainstream Egyptologists such as Frank Yurco:\n\nDiop's work has been subjected to criticism from a number of scholars. Robert O. Collins, a former history professor at \nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara, and James M. Burns, a professor in history at Clemson University, have both referred to Diop's writings of Ancient Egypt and his theories, characterizing it as \"revisionist\". Toyin Falola has called Diop's work \"passionate, combative, and revisionist\". Santiago Juan-Navarro a professor at Florida International University has described Diop as having \"undertaken the task of supporting this Afrocentric view of history from an equally radical and 'mythic' point of view\". Diop's book \"Civilization or Barbarism\" was summarized as Afrocentric pseudohistory by academic and author Robert Todd Carroll.\n\nCheikh Anta Diop was awarded the \"Grand prix de la mémoire\" of the GPLA 2015; and the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar bears his name.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Before disbanding, they were signed by the Decaydance imprint of the Fueled by Ramen label. They were originally known as \"The Academy\", but added the \"Is...\" in 2004 to avoid legal complications with other established bands already under that name. The band released three studio albums, \"Almost Here\", \"Santi\", and \"Fast Times at Barrington High\", and four EPs. The band announced its break-up on 8 October 2011. In May 2015, lead singer William Beckett announced that the band would reunite at Riot Fest 2015 in Chicago. In addition the core members of the band Beckett, Mike Carden and Adam Siska, as well as Andy Mrotek and Ian Crawford (both of whom had not originally been part of the band), reunited for a farewell tour that took place during December 2015.\n\nWilliam Beckett (singer) and Adam T. Siska's (bass) plans for starting a band together came to fruition on March 4, 2003 recruiting Mike Carden (guitar) after his former band, Jodie, which had members of Victory records act June, broke up then eventually adding AJ LaTrace as a lead guitarist and Michael DelPrincipe (Little Mike) as a drummer. They recorded their self-titled debut EP, \"The Academy\" (2004), for the Chicago-based label LLR Recordings. LLR Recordings had previously released Beckett's solo project Remember Maine's debut album \"The Last Place You Look\" in 2002 and Mike Carden's solo folk album in 2003. The EP was recorded in Villa Park, IL at The Gallery of Carpet by producer Brian Zieske. Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy heard it and was impressed. The label Fueled by Ramen immediately signed the band. In July and August, the group went on tour with Fall Out Boy, Bayside, Name Taken, and Armor for Sleep.\n\nIn 2004 the band headed to Florida to record their Fueled by Ramen debut \"Almost Here\", produced by James Paul Wisner, who has worked with Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. After recording the album and doing a summer tour, the band underwent a lineup change. Thomas Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively. They hit the road hard, touring with Fall Out Boy, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep. The album was released on February 8, 2005 and the following summer, the band embarked on their first headlining tour alongside Plain White T's, Days Away and June. On Billboard's charts Almost Here peaked at No. 7 on Top Heatseekers, No. 16 on Independent Albums, and No. 185 on The Billboard 200.\nLater on in 2005, while Pete Wentz was finishing up work on Fall Out Boy's second album From Under the Cork Tree and his \"latest side project\" with John Janick of Fueled by Ramen, he discovered Panic! at the Disco and helped them release their debut album \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" through his label Decaydance. The Academy Is... was also signed to Decaydance that year.\n\nOn October 26, 2006, The Academy Is... had announced via the blog on their official website that Thomas Conrad and the band had parted ways. Michael Guy Chislett joined the band to replace Conrad on guitar.\n\nWhile touring as a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour, the band began the process of writing songs for their second album. Once finished, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their record with Butch Walker. As of December 23, 2006, the band had officially finished the recording process and the album, entitled \"Santi\", was released April 3, 2007 on the Fueled By Ramen label. The release of this album was listed on \"Blender\"'s 25 reasons to love 2007. On January 26, 2007 a sample of \"LAX to O'Hare\" was released on the band's AbsolutePunk profile. The album peaked at No. 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nThe band went on to release the song \"We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands\" as the album's first single, before releasing the album on April 3, 2007. Fall Out Boy, +44, Cobra Starship, and Paul Wall all joined the band on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, after which the band moved on to the \"Sleeping With Giants\" tour with support from The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep and Sherwood. Partly through the tour, labelmates Cobra Starship were added to the support. The tour ended on November 24, 2007 in Chicago.\n\nThe band's third studio album, \"Fast Times at Barrington High\", was released on August 19, 2008 through Fueled by Ramen. The title refers to the high school William Beckett, Adam Siska, and videographer Jack Edinger attended. The first single, \"About a Girl,\" was added to the band's MySpace page on July 15, 2008 and was subsequently made available from various download sites. The lead model in the official music video for \"About a Girl\", Brittany Moser, also went to Barrington the same time Adam and William were in high school. On August 25, 2008 \"About a Girl\" was played on The Hills (season 4, episode 2). Hayden Cler would abruptly leave the band after the singles “Summer Hair= Forever Young” and “His Girl Friday” on their MySpace page and PureVolume page. The album made it onto Rolling Stone Magazine's 50 Best Albums of the Year ranked as No. 46. It peaked at No. 17 on The Billboard 200.\n\nOn William Beckett's Twitter page, it was said The Academy Is... have finished recording their new EP, \"\". It was released on September 22, 2009 on iTunes, and was sold on the AP Fall Ball Tour. A limited number were also sold on their webstore The track \"I'm Yours Tonight\" was released on the band's Myspace page. Another track, \"Days Like Masquerades\" was played at an anti-suicide benefit at Barrington High School, in Barrington, Illinois. Another song, \"Sputter\" (featuring Jack's Mannequin singer Andrew McMahon), streamed on Banana's Music club, linked by both William and Pete Wentz via Twitter on September 21. On September 29, 2009, Pete Wentz announced via Twitter that TAI would replace The All-American Rejects for the St. Louis date of the Blink-182 tour, due to an injury to the AAR lead singer Tyson Ritter.\n\nOn May 24, 2011, the band made an announcement on their official website that said that bandmates, Andy Mrotek and Michael Guy Chislett, were leaving the band to pursue their own musical careers. There has reportedly been no hard feelings during this decision. William Beckett also stated that the three remaining members would be entering the studio soon to record their fourth full-length album. On October 8, 2011, the band announced their disbanding on their official Facebook page, stating that they had \"decided to go their separate ways\" but \"though we may not be together, you can look forward to hearing new music from each of us\".\n\nAndy Mrotek has been continuing his artistry and his solo project, The Animal Upstairs. Adam Siska has become the touring bassist for Say Anything and Carly Rae Jepsen. Lead singer William Beckett announced he would be releasing his debut solo EP in 2012. On March 13, 2012 he released his first solo single \"Compromising Me\" and on April 17, 2012 he released his new EP \"Walk the Talk\". Beckett released his sophomore EP, \"Winds Will Change\" and his third, \"What Will Be\", dropping on 30 October 2012. Genuine & Counterfeit is the debut solo full-length album by William Beckett. The album is the first full-length released by William since the break-up of his band The Academy Is... It was released by the NY based independent record label Equal Vision Records on August 20, 2013 and it was produced by Marc McClusky. The Academy Is...'s website (www.theacademyis.com) currently redirects to the band's Facebook page and is occasionally updated by their former label, Fueled By Ramen.\n\nOn September 12, 2015, The Academy Is... reunited to play their album \"Almost Here\" cover-to-cover at Riot Fest Chicago, an annual outdoor music festival. Former lead guitarist Michael Guy Chislett was the only final member who did not join the reunion. Ian Crawford, known for his roles in The Cab, Panic! at the Disco and Never Shout Never filled in for Chislett. In December 2015, the band embarked on a sixteen-date tour throughout the United States, in which they played Almost Here in its entirety and five additional songs from their back catalog. The band had their final show at The Observatory North Park in San Diego, California on December 30, 2015. As of July 2018, no announcement has yet been made regarding any future concert tours or new music, nor has any formal breakup been announced.\n\nTAITV was a video podcast series created by the band. The show, whose initials stand for The Academy Is... TV, was created to allow fans a peek into the offstage life of the band. TAITV episodes are available on iTunes and YouTube, and new episodes aired every Sunday night at 9/8c at the band's website. Guy Ripley, played by Ryland Blackinton (of Cobra Starship) has his own show on TAITV called \"Guy Ripley's True Things\". The third season of TAITV premiered June 1, 2008. TAITV episodes are made by the band's photographer and friend, Jack \"the Camera Guy\" Edinger. Jack has appeared in many episodes as cameos, does all voice overs, co-writes, edits, and shoots each episode. He took a break from TAITV to tour with Cobra Starship filming their podcast, CobraCam.Tv, until their new album, Hot Mess, was released. No new episodes have been released since mid-2009. However, on December 5, 2009, bassist Adam Siska stated via his Twitter account that \"TAITV is not dead. It's like Han Solo in the carbon tomb between Empire and Jedi. Sooner or later Luke will come kick Jabba's fat ass...\"\n\nBecause of the break up, TAITV has been discontinued.\n\nOn October 1, 2008, the band embarked on their fall co-headlining tour with good friends We the Kings, named \"Bill & Trav's Bogus Journey Tour\". The name refers to the 1991 movie \"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey\". Carolina Liar and fellow Decaydance band, Hey Monday also performed on the tour. On November 6, 2008 at House Of Blues in Chicago, Illinois, William Beckett debuted a new song called \"Winter Passing\" that the band had written only days before. Beckett has said the song is about winter time in the Midwest. He has since incorporated the song into other show sets. The track was released on December 2, 2008 on iTunes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

George Merrill was hired to manage the school as the first director, and Lick, as the school was informally known, officially opened in January, 1895. George Merrill was the director of Lick until 1939, and later also the director of the Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts and the Lux School for Industrial Training for Girls, which were both located immediately adjacent to the Lick campus at 17th Street & Potrero Avenue in the Mission District. In the early 1950s, The California School of Mechanical arts and the Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts merged to become Lick-Wilmerding High School. The Lux School later closed, and its students joined Lick-Wilmerding. Lick-Wilmerding High School moved to a new campus at 755 Ocean Avenue in 1956.\n\nEach student must be enrolled in a minimum of six five‐unit courses per semester, regardless of grade\nlevel. A total of 30 units per semester are required. In keeping with over a century of LWHS tradition, every student is required to complete technical arts courses (such as wood, metal, jewelry, or electronics).\n\nHistorically, LWHS has been known to offer technical courses that other independent schools in the Bay Area do not offer. Some of these include Metal, Woodworking, Robotics, Electronics and Jewelry. LWHS also has several year-long Architecture courses and an introduction to design course, entitled Contemporary Media and Art that is compulsory for all freshmen.\n\nLWHS' Performing Arts Department has a choir, jazz band, orchestra, and two a cappella vocal ensembles. There is also a dance program comprising four classes: Dance 1, Dance 2, Dance Ensemble, and Dance Company. The Theatre Program presents plays, musicals, and a festival of original one-act plays. Theatre class offerings include: Acting 1, Acting Intensive, Improv, Playwriting, Stagecraft, and Directing.\n\nThe school's 529 students in grades 9 through 12 reflect the LWHS tradition of a strong commitment to cultural and social diversity. The student body is 3% South Asian, 5% Southeast Asian, 9% African-American, 11% Latino, 18% East Asian, and 62% Caucasian. Overall, 22% of the student body self identifies as multiethnic, which explains why the sum of these percentages is more than 100%.\n\nOver the past four years, 123 students have earned recognition in the National Merit Scholarship Program; 20 have been named Finalists. In addition, 8 students have been selected for the National Hispanic Recognition Program.\n\nOf the 75 full and part-time faculty and administrators, 44 have master's degrees and 8 have doctorates.

In 1932 the group moved to its current location on a tract of land belonging to Degania Bet, where it absorbed groups from the Poale Zion movement and Hechalutz. Yisrael Hofesh, one of the founders of the kibbutz, who died in 2011 at the age of 107, helped to establish the banana industry and worked in the plywood factory run by the kibbutz.\n\nDuring the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Afikim was subjected to frequent shelling by Syrian and Iraqi forces, and was a stronghold of Palmach activity. Afterwards it was a center for agricultural training for IDF soldiers who planned to join kibbutzim after demobilization. During the split of the \"Kibbutz Meuhad\" movement, Afikim, unlike many other kibbutzim, did not split up into two villages. Rather it joined the Mapai-affiliated faction which went on to found the \"Ihud Kibbutzim\". In 1977, Afikim hosted 66 refugees from Vietnam. In 2011, the kibbutz accepted 100 new members.\nAfikim grows bananas, date palms, avocados, olives, subtropical flora, and grains. It also engages in aquaculture and dairy farming. The kibbutz has 400 cows. It operates \"Afimilk\", a dairy equipment company, and \"Afikim Electric Vehicles\", a producer of electric vehicles. In the 1980s, Afikim underwent an economic crisis and was partially privatized.\n\nIn 2010, Afikim announced its partnership in a half-billion-dollar milk production project in Vietnam. The project involved establishing a dairy of 30,000 cows to supply 500,000 liters of milk a day, about 40% of Vietnam's present milk consumption. Afikim was responsible for all stages of the enterprise, including breeding and preparing land for crops used as feed \n\nIn addition to a demonstration farm with 174 cows established for educational purposes, a commercial milk farm with 20,000 cows, the TH Milk facility, was built in stages by 2015. The milk output per cow is 9,300 liters of milk annually despite tropical conditions.\n\nThe first electronic milk meter, which measures how many liters of milk a cow has produced, was invented at Afikim. Other inventions include the pedometer, which counts the number of steps a cow takes, indicating the right time for insemination; AfiFarm, a milking and dairy herd management software program; AfiAct, a fertility detection system; and AfiLab, a device that analyses the components of the milk and detects bacteria.\n\nIn 2009, Assaf Inbari, a writer who grew up on the kibbutz, published \"Home\", a novel based on the history of Afikim. It was awarded the 2010 Israel Book Publishers Association's Platinum Prize and was on the shortlist of finalists for the Sapir Prize for Literature.\n\nIn 2011, Afikim Electric Vehicles' Breeze-S scooter won Germany's Red Dot design award in the life science and medicine category.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also four blocks along 218th Street from Inwood Hill Park and, also on 218th Street, provides access to Columbia University's Baker Field athletic complex, as well as the Allen Hospital, a satellite facility of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. North of the station, the line crosses the Broadway Bridge over the Harlem River Ship Canal into the mainland of New York.\n\nBoth platforms have one wooden adjacent station house in the center. However, only the southbound one is used for passenger service. Three doors from the platform lead to a small waiting area, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases going down to either western corners of Tenth Avenue and 215th Street.\n\nThe station house on the northbound platform is used for employees only. One exit-only turnstile at platform level leads to a staircase that goes down to the northeast corner of 215th Street and Tenth Avenue while a High Entry/Exit Turnstile, also at platform level, leads to a staircase going down to the southeast corner.\n\nIn 2018, the station had 553,050 boardings, making it the 402nd most used station in the 424-station system. This amounted to an average of 1,787 passengers per weekday. In terms of annual passenger ridership and in terms of weekday daily ridership, this is the least used station in Manhattan.\n\n"}

The distinction between the sacred and the profane was considered by Émile Durkheim to be central to the social reality of human religion.\n\nThe profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the \"Lebenswelt\" or lifeworld.\n\nIn contrast, the sacred, or \"sacrum\" in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or numinous can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an amulet for example may be sacred yet little respected.\n\nRites of passage represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.\n\nReligion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.\n\nModernization and the Enlightenment project have led to a secularisation of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred. The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.\n\nCarl Jung expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.\n\nThe advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. Modernism set out to bring myth and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality — Wallace Stevens speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.\n\nFundamentalism – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.\n\nPsychology too has set out to protect the boundaries of the individual self from profane intrusion, establishing ritual places for inward work in opposition to the postmodern loss of privacy.\n\nSeamus Heaney considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.\n\n"}

She served as the interim Chairman of the Council of State of Liberia from 3 September 1996 until 2 August 1997, following the First Liberian Civil War. After eleven international peace attempts between 1990 and 1995 to end the civil war in Liberia, the attempts appeared to succeed. The interim Council of State consisted of a civilian chairman, as well as members of warring factions: Charles Taylor, United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-K leader Alhaji Kromah, Liberia Peace Council leader George Boley, and two other civilians.\n\nPerry was known for being the first female president of Liberia and of contemporary Africa as a whole. Liberia also has the distinction of electing Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the first elected female African leader in modern times.\n\nPerry was born July 16, 1939, in a rural area of Grand Cape Mount County, Liberia, the daughter of Marjon and AlHaji Semila Fahnbulleh. She was a Muslim of Vai ethnic ancestry. As a child, Perry participated in the Sande society, a traditional school and secret society for females, and attended regular classes. Her parents later enrolled her in a Roman Catholic school for girls in Monrovia run by missionary nuns. Perry graduated from the Teachers College of the University of Liberia. She worked as an elementary school teacher in Grand Cape Mount County.\n\nShe married McDonald Perry, a judge and legislator and they had seven children. After her children were grown, Perry worked in the Monrovia office of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1971 and taught at a Sande school as an elder.\n\nWhen her husband was involved in politics, Ruth Perry engaged in the electoral campaign and tried to get women to vote for him. After her husband died, the party asked Ruth to run as senator for their home district. In 1985, Perry won a seat in the Liberian Senate as a Unity Party candidate. In response to Samuel Doe's presidential election after calling elections, Unity Party office-holders and other official opposition politicians boycotted the Senate in protest, asserting that the Doe government was illegitimate. Perry did not join the boycott and became the lone member of the opposition in the Assembly. \"You can't solve the problems by staying away,\" she said. She served until 1989. Afterwards, Perry launched a retail business and became active in civilian groups such as Women Initiative in Liberia, Women in Action for Goodwill and the Association of Social Services that sought an end to the growing Liberian Civil War.\n\nOn August 17, 1996, after 17 years of conflict and 7 years of war, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) representatives negotiated a cease-fire between Liberia's warring factions and announced that Perry would replace Wilton Sankawulo as Chairman of the Council of State in an interim government. Reportedly all four warlords in the Liberian conflict had agreed to the peace agreement with Perry as interim leader, after her return from a brief exile in Staten Island, New York.\n\nAfter stepping down, Perry moved between Liberia and the US. In 2004, she was an \"African President-in-Residence\" at the African Presidential Archives and Research Center at Boston University. Perry died on January 8, 2017 at the age of 77.\n"}

{"id": "1981146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981146", "title": "Southern Partisan", "text": "Southern Partisan\n\nSouthern Partisan is a neo-confederate political magazine which was published in Columbia, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1979, the magazine focused on its Southern region and those states that were formerly members of the Confederate States of America. Its first editor was Thomas Fleming. From 1999 to 2009 it was edited by Christopher Sullivan. After 2009 it ceased publication as a print edition and is now published only online. It has been called \"arguably the most important neo-Confederate periodical\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nThe magazine generally espouses a pro-southern perspective on political issues and the American Civil War. The magazine features commentary on southern culture, history, literature, the Southern Agrarians, the Civil War and Confederacy, and current political issues. It carries a news section entitled \"CSA Today\" covering stories from each of the eleven former Confederate states, as well as Missouri and Kentucky, which the Confederate States claimed to have admitted.\n\nThe magazine is harshly critical of political correctness and highlights news events involving what it describes as \"politically correct\" policy-making, such as the removal of Confederate historical monuments. It also gives out a \"Scalawag Award\" in each issue to Southerners who act contrary to the magazine's editorial position.\n\nBook reviews of current texts pertaining to all aspects of the southern United States appear in each issue, as do general political opinion pieces from conservative and libertarian perspectives. The magazine carries columns by syndicated opinion commentators including Walter Williams, William Murchison, Joseph Sobran, and Charley Reese.\n\nAlthough the magazine is frequently found in the historical racks in mainstream bookstores, it can occasionally be found in the current events section. Its emphasis is also cultural and political. Its statement of purpose, stated at the top of its masthead in every issue, is taken from a letter written by Donald Davidson to Allen Tate in May 1927: \"If there were a Southern magazine, intelligently conducted and aimed specifically, under the doctrine of provincialism, at renewing a certain sort of sectional consciousness and drawing separate groups of Southern thought together, something might be done to save the South.\"\n\nDue to its conservative political leaning and advocacy of the southern side in the American Civil War, \"Southern Partisan\" has been the subject of controversy. The \"New York Times\" described \"Southern Partisan\" as \"one of the (southern) region's most right-wing magazines,\" notes its disapproval of Abraham Lincoln and the Union during the Civil War, and tendency to \"venerate the rebel soldiers who fought to secede from the United States.\" According to the \"Times,\" it is also socially conservative as evidenced by a 1999 editorial denouncing the \"Miami Herald\"'s coverage of gay issues. Though critical of these beliefs, the \"Times\" nevertheless notes that \"Many of (\"Southern Partisan's\") articles, however, are more high-minded historical reviews in the tradition of the Southern agrarian movement, which glorified the South's slow-paced traditions of farms and small towns.\"\n\nSeveral sources on the political left have openly accused the magazine of racism. Ed Sebesta, an anti-confederate partisan based in Dallas, Texas commonly attacks the magazine, asserting that \"Southern Partisan\", along with \"Chronicles\", are the \" major publications\" of the Confederate movement. Slate online magazine has described the \"Southern Partisan\" as a \"crypto-racist, pro-Confederate magazine.\" In 2000, the president of People for the American Way called it \"racist\" and pointed to columns that criticize Martin Luther King, Jr and Nelson Mandela, and alleged that it views slavery favorably. The \"Times\" report quotes a passage about the \"myth that vicious white slave traders dragged Africans from their idyllic homeland to serve as chattel for arrogant white Americans.\" They also note that the same article describes white slave traders as being better to the blacks than the African warlords. The \"Times\" notes that \"(t)he magazine rarely writes about slavery,\" preferring to focus on more genteel aspects of the past. According to the \"Times\" article, \"Southern Partisan\" \"takes the position that the Civil War was fought not over slavery, but over the preservation of a Southern way of life that to this day is worth preserving.\" (2/8/2000)\n\nThe magazine rejects many of its critics' characterizations, arguing that they derive primarily from the far left wing of the political spectrum and from advocates of political correctness. Responding to critics the magazine's Christopher Sullivan charged them with taking \"quotes out of context to paint a picture of racial and historical bigotry in the \"Partisan\".\" (\"The Never Ending Struggle\" by Christopher Sullivan, \"Southern Partisan\" 1999 4th Quarter) As a prime example, Sullivan pointed to excerpted quotations that critics purported to speak favorably about slavery but were in fact a synopsis of statistical data from \"Time on the Cross,\" a scholarly study on slavery authored by socialist cliometrists Stanley Engerman and Nobel prize recipient Robert Fogel. Sullivan contended that other quotations had been similarly misconstrued by critics on the left and rejected their attacks as the product of a politically correct and politically motivated \"feeding frenzy.\"\n\nResponding to the allegations of racism, the magazine's editors are quick to point out that they regularly publish articles by African American writers such as Walter E. Williams. Sullivan dismisses these allegations as ad hominem attacks and predicts they will continue from sources in the media and on the political left as long as the magazine is published. \"Will it end? As King Lear put it, 'Never, never, never, never, never.' And that's why our resistance to the assaults must also never end.\"\n\n\"Southern Partisan\" received national attention in 2001 during the confirmation hearings of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Democrats in the U.S. Senate criticized Ashcroft over a 1998 interview he gave with the magazine in which he praised Robert E. Lee. It was alleged that Ashcroft's statements exhibited racial insensitivity since Lee was a former general for the Confederacy. The magazine responded that Ashcroft's critics were engaging in political correctness and playing the \"race card\" for political reasons. When pressed by Democratic Senators Joseph Biden and Ted Kennedy about the interview during his confirmation hearings, Ashcroft replied \"I would rather be falsely accused of racism than to falsely accuse others.\"\n\n\n\n\"Supportive\"\n\n\"Critics\"\n"}

It was released on September 30, 2002. It is the second game in the \"No One Lives Forever\" series, the sequel to the 2000 game \"\".\n\nThe story follows super-spy Cate Archer as she once again takes up arms against the international criminal organization H.A.R.M. This second game features even more exotic locales, such as a ninja village, a secret submarine base, and a trailer park in Ohio during a tornado. A whole new range of outlandish gadgets and weapons are also introduced, including a blowtorch disguised as a can of hair spray and a robotic bomb disguised as an adorable kitten. A spin off to the game, entitled \"Contract J.A.C.K.\", was released in 2003.\n\nAs in the first game, missions can be completed by pure action, by using pure stealth, by using gadgets, or a combination of all methods. In many cases, the missions are more open ended. While the original game contained several missions that required you not to be detected or to avoid setting off alarms, the sequel contained only a few objectives that required complete stealth (i.e. do not set off any alarms while in the proximity of a certain objective). However, to counter this, \"NOLF2\" utilizes re-spawning enemies more often than the original to encourage the player to complete the missions in a surreptitious manner. The enemies logic is determined through the use of a Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) architecture, by where the enemies themselves have more control over the actions they perform.\n\nThe game focuses on tensions rising between United States and Soviet Union over the tiny, but strategic Isle of Khios. A year after the events of the first game, Jones, now the sole Commander of U.N.I.T.Y., is taking a vacation and leaves Bruno Lawrie, the Temporary Director of U.N.I.T.Y., in charge.\n\nU.N.I.T.Y. agent Cate Archer is sent to Japan to investigate a rumored international crime convention expected to take place in the pastoral village of Inotakimura. There, she locates another U.N.I.T.Y. agent Isamu Hatori, who tells Cate to photograph the meeting's participants, including the Director, H.A.R.M.'s leader, without arousing their suspicion. After Cate photographs the meeting's participants, as Hatori tasked her to, she is stabbed by a ninja named Isako, who leaves her for dead.\n\nAfter the opening credits, Cate is hospitalized by U.N.I.T.Y. and is restored back to health by U.N.I.T.Y.'s staff scientist, Dr. Otto Schenker. After Cate's recovery, the U.S. military advisers, Issac Barnes and General Morgan Hawkins, inform Cate and Bruno of H.A.R.M.'s and the Soviets' plan regarding Project: Omega to prepare their invasion for the small island of Khios. Meanwhile, H.A.R.M. agent Dmitrij Volkov is now immobilized in a full-body cast and using a wheelchair due to a skiing accident.\n\nCate travels to Siberia where she uncovers information about Project: Omega and sabotages the radio tower and power plant. After collecting information regarding Project: Omega, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. and the Soviets, but manages to escape by destroying a bridge. After her mission in Siberia, Cate and Bruno learn that the Soviets and H.A.R.M. work together to turn the island into the world's first Communist vacation spot with a five-star hotel. Cate travels to Akron, Ohio, and investigates the house belonging to a man, Melvin Blitzny, a vacuum cleaner salesman who serves as a double agent between H.A.R.M. and U.N.I.T.Y. to impersonate former U.N.I.T.Y agent Tom Goodman. After she recovers information about Project: Omega, she is ambushed by Isako's ninjas as she escapes the Blitzny residence. A tornado hits the area and Cate takes down Isako's ninjas before following Isako to a trailer home as it is lifted by a tornado. Cate and Isako engage in a sword fight until the trailer's ceiling rips off, sending Isako into the tornado.\n\nAfter being recovered from the tornado incident, Cate and her ally, Magnus Armstrong, head to India where they meet Armstrong's old friend, Kamal, a former member of H.A.R.M.'s Indian branch. With Kamal's help, Cate is hired by H.A.R.M., and gains access to their vault, where she collects more documents about Project: Omega. Soon after, Cate and Armstrong are captured by one of H.A.R.M.'s most deadly operatives, Pierre, the self-proclaimed Mime King. Cate and Armstrong escape by welding one of the cage's bolts, and fight their way out of India. During their escape, Armstrong tries to grab Pierre but only succeeds in removing his heavy black cloak and mask, revealing his true form as a mime midget riding a unicycle. Cate and Armstrong try to chase him riding a tricycle, but fail to apprehend Pierre.\n\nLater, Cate and Armstrong head to Antarctica to explore a base there and uncover H.A.R.M.'s intentions with Project: Omega. There, Cate learns that Project: Omega consists of turning soldiers into Super-Soldiers, which were indestructible cyborg-like fighting machines. Cate encounters the first test subject, a Super-Soldier named Lt. Anders, an ex-military officer who believes Cate is his daughter, Abigail. Lt. Anders chases Cate and destroys large parts of the base, but Cate manages to escape after Armstrong heroically grabbed the Lt., allowing her to escape before H.A.R.M. arrives.\n\nMeanwhile, the Director learns of Cate's efforts in India, and sends a team of Super-Soldiers to destroy H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters as punishment. The punishment also provides H.A.R.M an ideal field test for the Super-Soldiers before they are sent to Khios on their primary mission. Cate immediately returns to Calcutta, India, but finds that the Super-Soldiers already arrived. The only thing Cate can do is try to get everyone to safety.\n\nCate then returns to U.N.I.T.Y. and gives Doctor Schenker the technical specifications she recovered from the Antarctic facility so that Doctor Schenker can devise how to stop the Super-Soldiers. Doctor Schenker loses his glasses, so after Cate finds Doctor Schenker's glasses in a café, the U.N.I.T.Y. headquarters is attacked by Pierre's mimes. Cate takes down the mimes and then proceeds to rescue Armstrong, who is reportedly captured and located at a H.A.R.M undersea base, unaware that Pierre placed a telephone bug in Doctor Schenker's office. Cate arrives at H.A.R.M.'s undersea headquarters and makes her way to the lower level to rescue Armstrong who is trapped in a Super-Soldier pod. Cate takes down Pierre and his mimes, but after she frees Armstrong, Lt. Anders, who is also freed from the pod, destroys parts of the undersea base, causing it to implode. Cate and Armstrong escape the drowning base, but as they reach the Director's private deck they discover that the escape pod is jammed. Armstrong himself releases the pod as he travels to surface in the drowning undersea base. The escape pod is then captured by a H.A.R.M. submarine on its way back up to the surface.\n\nCate is now held in H.A.R.M.'s secret artificial volcano lair, and escapes after she recovers additional plans for Project: Omega and sabotages the lair. Cate re-encounters and defeats Volkov, who falls into a lava pit. Cate reaches the surface, and discovers that H.A.R.M.'s lair is built directly beneath the Japanese village of Inotakimura. There, Cate battles Isako and her ninjas, and defeats her. The Director arrives and attempts to kill Isako but Cate saves Isako by throwing a ninja star at the Director, disarming him.\n\nCate is then sent to Khios, where she embarks on her final mission to stop Project: Omega. Unfortunately for her, the island is being overrun by H.A.R.M. and Soviet troops with Super Soldiers. The U.S launches a nuclear missile to destroy the Soviet held Khios, prompting a Third World War. Cate uses the specially devised Anti Super-Soldier Serum (ASSS) to defeat the Super Soldiers, drowns the H.A.R.M. submarine and successfully repels the invasion. Project: Omega is put to a stop once and for all when Lt. Anders, who escaped the submarine, destroyed the missile before it crashed in the island as he plummets to the ocean below. In a short cutscene after the game credits, the Director's mother rebukes his actions and Volkov tells the Director he quits. The game ends with the Director swearing revenge for Cate and U.N.I.T.Y.\n\nThe source code for the game engine was released by Monolith Productions and Sierra Entertainment as part of the No One Lives Forever 2 Toolkit for allowing the player to create own levels, models, music, sounds, and more. It is available for download. Visual C++ 6.0 is needed for compilation.\n\n\"No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way\" received critical acclaim upon its release with an aggregate score of 91.03% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. It also won several awards, including Game of the Year from GameSpy. The game also received a nomination for the prestigious \"Excellence in Writing\" Game Developers Choice Award, but lost to \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\".\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" named \"No One Lives Forever 2\" the best computer game of 2002, tied with \"Battlefield 1942\". They wrote that it is \"the \"Godfather II\" of game sequels, and it further cements Monolith's spot at the top of the 3D gaming world.\" The game also won the magazine's \"Best Music\", \"Best Writing\" and \"Best AI\" awards. It was nominated for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"2002 Best Action Game\" and \"Computer Gaming World\"s \"Action Game of the Year\" awards, both of which ultimately went to \"\". The latter magazine's editors called it \"among the funniest and most entertaining games of 2002.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1981158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981158", "title": "American Alpine Club", "text": "American Alpine Club\n\nThe American Alpine Club (AAC) is a non-profit member organization whose goal is \"a united community of competent climbers and healthy climbing landscapes.\" The Club is housed in the American Mountaineering Center (AMC) in Golden, Colorado.\n\nThrough its members, the AAC advocates for American climbers domestically and around the world; provides grants and volunteer opportunities to protect and conserve climbing areas; hosts local and national climbing festivals and events; cares for the nation's leading climbing library and mountaineering museum; manages the Hueco Rock Ranch, New River Gorge Campground, and Grand Teton Climbers' Ranch as part of a larger lodging network for climbers; and annually gives about $100,000 toward climbing, conservation, and research grants that fund adventurers who travel the world. It also maintains regional sections—with both regional staff and volunteers—throughout the United States.\n\nThe AAC publishes two journals, The \"American Alpine Journal\" (AAJ) and \"Accidents in North American Mountaineering\" (Accidents), and a \"Guidebook to Membership\" annually. Collections of these journals, along with tens of thousands of other climbing-related publications and mountaineering literature, can be found in the Henry S. Hall, Jr. American Alpine Club Library, also located in the AMC. The AAC is a 501(c)3 organization supported by gifts and grants from individuals, corporations and foundations, member dues, and income from lodging, publications and restricted endowments.\n\nFounded by Arctic zoologist and geographer Angelo Heilprin, the American Alpine Club was established in 1902 and had 45 founding members. These original members were primarily from the East Coast, although a handful resided in the Midwest, Washington, and Alaska. Among them was Annie Smith Peck and the AAC's first president, Charles Ernest Fay, who was also a founding member of the Appalachian Mountain Club.\n\nThe Club was primarily East Coast-oriented for the first half-century of its existence; its headquarters remained in New York until 1993, when the Board unanimously decided to move the AAC to its current location in Golden, Colorado. The Club is housed in the American Mountaineering Center, whose other tenants include the Colorado Mountain Club and Outward Bound.\n\nThe AAC is historically and contemporarily associated with a number of other American and International organizations. It was a founding member of the Union International des Associations d’Alpinism (UIAA) in 1930 and the Arctic Institute of North America in 1948.\n\nThe AAC Library was established in 1916 by a gift from American mountaineer Henry Montagnier, whose collection was added to over time by various early club members. The Library was initially focused primarily on the Alps. From 1916 until 1929, the Library was housed in the New York Public Library, which devoted an entire room to the AAC. During this time, the Library grew to include contributions from many members, as well as cultural artifacts from their various expeditions to the Himalaya and elsewhere. In 1941, the AAC purchased a renovated firehouse in Manhattan to house the growing Library.\n\nWhen the AAC moved its permanent headquarters to Golden in 1993, the Library, too, moved to its current location in the basement of the American Mountaineering Center, the Henry S. Hall Jr. American Alpine Club Library. Soon after this move, AAC member John Boyle – part of the American expedition that first ascended Mt. Everest's Kangshung Face in 1983 – donated the John M. Boyle Himalayan Library, which included 2,500 books, 400 expedition reports, and 100 videos and films. Many items are autographed by the expedition members who wrote them. Most recently, in 2008, a private collector donated 30,000 bound volumes of the Central Asia Library. Many of the Library's original volumes are housed in the current Library's Rare Books Room.\n\nToday, AAC members can search the Library's website for literature and guidebooks and have items shipped to them from Golden. The Library also features an online Guidebook Finder which allows users to search for climbing guidebooks by location.\n\nFrom the time of its founding until the mid-1980s, candidates for membership in the AAC were required to submit a list of notable ascents at high altitude or other “significant alpine accomplishments.” The phrase “... or the equivalent” appeared at the end of this bylaw, allowing the Board to elect artists and writers with little tangible experience, but for the most part, membership in the Club meant that a person had already achieved a great deal in the world of mountaineering. Today, the AAC has no prerequisites for membership.\n\nAnother notable founding member is naturalist, prolific writer, and Sierra Club co-founder John Muir, who is considered by many to be the founder of the wilderness preservation movement. Muir also served as the Club's second president, and was instrumental in bringing the AAC to a central role in environmental conservation in the United States.\n\nLyman Spitzer, noted theoretical physicist and astronomer was a member of the club. In 1965, Spitzer and Donald Morton became the first men to climb Mount Thor , located in Auyuittuq National Park, on Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada.

The school was recognized by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program in the 1990-91 school year. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Secondary Schools since 1965. The school motto is \"Excellence with Honor and Integrity.\"\n\nAs of the 2017-18 school year, the school had an enrollment of 2,082 students and 164.3 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.7:1. There were 264 students (12.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 96 (4.6% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\n\nEBHS is one of the few high schools in the state to only house students in grades 10-12, with 9th graders at the middle school level.\n\nEast Brunswick High School opened for the 1958-59 school year. Previously, students living in the Township had attended South River High School in neighboring South River. In that first year, the school housed grades six, seven, eight and nine. Those four classes occupied the school until June 1962, when the original 9th graders became its first graduating class and the school contained grades nine through twelve. Because the school exceeded its intended capacity of 1,700 students, freshmen were dropped into the town's two junior high schools in 1967, later one junior high school. Enrollment reached a peak of about 2,600 in 1973. By 1990, the school had fewer than 2,000 students, falling to around 1,700 by 1997.\n\nAdditions to the school were built in 1965, 1970 and 2001, in efforts to ease overcrowding. The 2001 expansion included a second level of classrooms, over the administrative offices; a corridor connecting three \"buildings\" that had previously been connected only by a covered outdoor walkway; and expanded facilities for the cafeteria, library, arts and athletic departments.\n\nThe school day at East Brunswick High School begins at 7:26 am and ends at 2:12 pm. It operates its daily bell schedule on a 12-period system.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005-06 school year, for security reasons, the school instituted an ID system in which the students must wear their IDs at all times.\n\nEast Brunswick High School was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive, during the 1990-91 school year.\n\nIn the 2014 \"America's Top High School\", \"Newsweek\" ranked the school 130th overall in the nation.\n\nIn its 2013 report on \"America's Best High Schools\", \"The Daily Beast\" ranked the school 484th among participating public high schools and 41st among schools in New Jersey.\n\nIn the 2012 \"Ranking America's High Schools\" issue by \"The Washington Post\", the school was ranked 45th in New Jersey, after being ranked 48th statewide in 2011. In the May 22, 2007, issue of \"Newsweek\", ranking the country's top high schools, East Brunswick High School was listed in 997th place, the 30th-highest ranked school in New Jersey. The school was ranked 886th in the May 8, 2006, issue of \"Newsweek\", listing the \"Top 1,200 High Schools in The United States\".\n\nFor the 1996-97 school year, East Brunswick High School was named a \"Star School\" by the New Jersey Department of Education, the highest honor that a New Jersey school can achieve.\n\nIn the April 1996 issue, the high school was cited as best in the state by \"Redbook\" magazine.\n\nDuring the 2001-02 school year, East Brunswick High School's Intergenerational Program was honored by the Best Practices Program in the state of New Jersey.\n\nThe school was the 47th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in \"New Jersey Monthly\" magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 121st in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 71st in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 76th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 60th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which included 316 schools across the state.\n\nThe Schooldigger.com website ranked the school tied for 109th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (a decrease of 35 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (87.9%) and language arts literacy (94.4%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).\n\nIn addition to regular, honors, and Advanced Placement classes, the curriculum includes numerous electives in humanities, business, visual arts, music, drama, family and consumer science, and technology education. Two Cooperative Education programs are available, as well as a shared time program at the East Brunswick campus of the Middlesex County Vocational and Technical High Schools. Students are encouraged to elect courses outside their major interests. Students may receive credit for private music lessons.\n\nThe school district had all its staff input their students' grades into a computer program called InteGrade Pro. Starting with the 2009-10 school year, InteGrade was replaced with a system known as Genesis, which provides a unified, wholly online attendance and grading system. Genesis also features auto-updating grades, a huge improvement over the previous online component to the InteGrade system, ParentConnect, which only updated once daily. If a teacher finds the need to, progress reports will be mailed to students' homes at a designated date near the middle of a quarter. At the end of a quarter, the grades are exported by teachers to administration, where they are formally presented to the parents/guardians of students through a formal report card.\n\nThe Board of Education changed the grading system to a \"quality point\" type of system where grades are equal to a number (GPA) and the GPA from the four quarters plus midterms (and/or finals) are averaged as well. Grade Point Average calculations are weighted three different ways: Standard scale, Honors Scale and AP scale. The Honors Scale transposes GPA values to their respective letter grades by a factor of 1.15, while the AP scale transposes by a factor of 1.25.\n\nEast Brunswick High School offers a full range of clubs and events. The school is perhaps most well known for its success in the national competition, for which it won the national title in 1998, and then again three years in a row from 2004 to 2006. East Brunswick High School has also won the state competition for nearly every year in the past 25 years. Other clubs include Model United Nations, Mock Trial, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Key Club, Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), Math Team, Academic Team, Pre-medical Club, Science League, Code Club, \"Clarion\" (school newspaper), \"Emerald\" (yearbook), Drama Club, Jazz Ensemble, Marching Band, African American Club, Asian American Club, Spanish Club, French Club, German Club, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Club, Amnesty International Club, and various honor societies. East Brunswick High School is one of a growing number of schools in the country that has various religious clubs such as According to Jesus (A2J, formerly known as Bible Club), Islamic Club, Coptic Orthodox Club and the Jewish Student Union.\n\nThe East Brunswick High School Bears compete in the Greater Middlesex Conference, which operates under the supervision of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. With 2,102 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2015-16 school year as Central Jersey, Group IV for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 1,082 to 2,349 students in that grade range.\n\nThe boys' bowling team won the overall state championship in 1997. The team won the Group IV state championship and the overall Tournament of Champions in 2017.\n\nThe boys' volleyball team won the 2007 NJSIAA South Jersey sectional championship with a 25-19, 31-29 victory over Southern Regional High School. The team went on to win the overall state title, defeating St. Peter's Preparatory School, 25-21, 25-22. This was the sixth state championship in East Brunswick boys volleyball history, also winning in 1999-2001 and 2003–04, tied for second with the most overall titles with Bridgewater-Raritan High School.\n\nThe East Brunswick girls' soccer team has been one of the most successful programs in New Jersey. The Bears won 27 of 30 county/conference tournament championships, including 21 consecutive championships from 1980 to 2000. The Bears won five consecutive Greater Middlesex Conference Tournament titles, including a 2-1 victory over Old Bridge in 2007 and a 3-0 win over Bishop Ahr in 2008.\n\nThe girls' tennis team won the Greater Middlesex Conference title for nine consecutive years from 2006-2014.\n\nThe girls' bowling team won the Group IV title in the 2007-08 season, after bowling a 1077 in the state final.\n\nAfter winning their second Group IV championship in 2008, the girls' tennis team won the Tournament of Champions, defeating Millburn High School and ending that school's streak of winning 98 consecutive matches.\n\nThe football team won the Central Jersey Group IV state sectional championships in 2004 and 2009. East Brunswick won the Central Jersey Group IV state sectional title in the 2009-10 season, defeating Brick Memorial High School by a score of 9-0, earning the program its first sectional championship since 2004.\n\nOn October 7, 2005, shortly after being informed by then-Superintendent of Schools Jo Ann Magistro that he would not be permitted to join his football team in prayer as he had done in the past and that some parents had complained about the prayers, East Brunswick High School coach Marcus Borden resigned from his position. Borden, also a tenured Spanish teacher, had by then had a 23-year career with East Brunswick Public Schools. District spokeswoman Trish LaDuca told the East Brunswick newspaper \"Home News Tribune\" that a \"representative of the school district cannot constitutionally initiate prayer, encourage it or lead it.\" \n\nThe East Brunswick football team lost its game in a shutout on the day Borden resigned. Following Borden's resignation, nearly 100 players, parents, and coaches arrived at his house on a rainy day pleading for his return. Borden agreed and received \"pro bono\" legal representation the next week. He filed a lawsuit against the district on November 23 alleging that it was violating his constitutional rights; lawyer Ronald Riccio represented Borden.\n\nJudge Dennis M. Cavanaugh of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled on July 26, 2006 that Borden could bow his head and bend his knee if the team captains (i.e., students) lead the players in prayer. However, this decision was overturned on April 15, 2008, by a unanimous decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in which Judge D. Michael Fisher concluded that \"a reasonable observer would conclude that he is continuing to endorse religion when he bows his head during the pre-meal grace and takes a knee with his team in the locker room while they pray.\"\n\nIn May 2007, a 16-year old male student from EBHS posted a school shooting threat on the internet and was arrested on Monday morning before school once people had noticed it. After investigating the student's home, no weapons were found inside and police determined it was only a hoax.\n\nIn February 2019, a student from EBHS forged a letter on social media and in a bathroom at the school that had the signature of Superintendent Victor Valeski on it. The forged letter stated that Valeski tried smoking (vaping) an e-cigarette/juul and liked it and as a result, had decided to reverse and replace a vaping policy in which the new policy would allow students to vape in the bathroom/on school grounds only once with no consequences, but after being caught using it a second time, would face a suspension. After this forged letter was found, Valeski said the student would likely be suspended but not face any criminal charges.\n\nThe 2018-19 school year was a rough one for EBHS, as another incident happened in April 2019 where a female white student pulled off a hijab (headscarf) of a female muslim student in a physical fight in the student lounge. The female white student was criminally charged and arrested with simple assault and harassment after an investigation by the East Brunswick Police Department and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. Despite this, she was not charged with a bias or hate crime. The muslim student was not charged with anything, although she was disciplined along with the female white student and both girls were absent from school the next day. The video of the fight quickly went viral online and on social media.\n\nCore members of the school's administration are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981162", "title": "Black Sabbath (song)", "text": "Black Sabbath (song)\n\n\"Black Sabbath\" is a song by the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, written in 1969 and released on their self titled debut album. In 1970, it was released as a four-track 12-inch single, with \"The Wizard\" also on the A-side and \"Evil Woman\" and \"Sleeping Village\" on B-side, on the Philips Records label Vertigo. It is widely considered to be the first heavy metal song.\n\nAccording to the band, the song was inspired by an experience that Geezer Butler had in the days of Earth. Butler, obsessed with the occult at the time, painted his apartment matte black, placed several inverted crucifixes, and put many pictures of Satan on the walls. Ozzy Osbourne handed Butler a black occult book, written in Latin and decorated with numerous pictures of Satan. Butler read the book and then placed it on a shelf beside his bed before going to sleep. When he woke up, he claims he saw a large black figure standing at the end of his bed, staring at him. The figure vanished and Butler ran to the shelf where he had placed the book earlier, but the book was gone. Butler related this story to Osbourne, who then wrote the lyrics to the song based on Butler's experience. The song starts with the lyrics:\nA version of this song from Black Sabbath's first demo exists on the Ozzy Osbourne compilation album \"The Ozzman Cometh\". The song has an extra verse with additional vocals before the bridge. The guitar and bass are tuned down one whole step, resulting in the key position of A being played on the fretboard, but having the pitch as G (octave - D flat) to the listener. It's one of the band's most frequently performed tracks, being featured on every single tour of their career.\n\nAllMusic's Steve Huey said the song is an example wherein Black Sabbath appropriated the blue note from the standard pentatonic blues scale and developed a heavy metal riff. The main riff is an inversion of a tritone, constructed with a harmonic progression including a diminished fifth / augmented fourth. This particular interval is often known as \"diabolus in musica\", for it has musical qualities which are often used to suggest Satanic connotations in Western music. The song \"Black Sabbath\" was one of the earliest examples in heavy metal to make use of this interval, and since then, the genre has made extensive use of \"diabolus in musica\".\n\nThe riff was created when bassist Geezer Butler began playing a fragment of \"Mars\" from Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\" suite. Inspired, guitarist Tony Iommi returned the next day with the famously dark tritone.\n\nThe main riff of \"Black Sabbath\" is one of the most famous examples of harmonic progressions with the tritone G-C:\n<score>\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\n\"Black Sabbath\" was ranked the second best Black Sabbath song by Rock - Das Gesamtwerk der größten Rock-Acts im Check. It was ranked the best song in Black Sabbath's Ozzy-Era discography by Loudwire. \nThis was the final song played on the radio station WAAF 107.3 in Boston after 50 years on the air. \n\nA music video was made for the song, as part of the band's 1970 performance on the German show Beat-Club. The video was filmed in a studio with a village on the foreground.\n\n\"Black Sabbath\" has been covered by the following bands:\n\n"}

It was developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal Games. \"J.A.C.K.\" (Just Another Contract Killer) is set in the time frame between the events of the original \"\" and \"No One Lives Forever 2\".\n\nThe game follows John Jack, a professional killer recruited by H.A.R.M., a criminal organization central to the No One Lives Forever series. Contract J.A.C.K. is set between \"No One Lives Forever\" and \"No One Lives Forever 2\". The game does not involve UNITY, the organization for which Cate Archer works and that opposed H.A.R.M. in the other two games. Rather, \"J.A.C.K.\" pits H.A.R.M. against a rival criminal organization, Danger Danger.\n\nAfter a night of heavy drinking, Jack is apprehended by thugs, who are ordered to kill him. Before they can, he breaks free from the ropes that tied him to a chair and slaughters the thugs that swarm the building. Before he can leave, he receives a phone call from Dimitrij Volkov, H.A.R.M.'s Director of Executive Action. Volkov tells Jack to report to a job interview at the Roman ruins on Malta. The interview consists of Jack mowing down waves of H.A.R.M. troopers as Volkov taunts them over a loudspeaker. In the end, Jack is hired by H.A.R.M.\n\nFor his first assignment, Jack must infiltrate a Czechoslovakian military base to figure out why Danger Danger is interested in it. Upon delving deeper into the base, Jack becomes aware that the facility is a secret rocket launch site. Danger Danger is trying to use a Czech rocket to recover Dr. Harij, a H.A.R.M. scientist stranded on the moon after the destruction of H.A.R.M.'s space station in \"No One Lives Forever\". Although Danger Danger is able to launch a rocket full of their men, Jack commandeers a second rocket and heads to the moon after them.\n\nOn the moon, Jack must fight through Danger Danger goons to get to Dr. Harij. Danger Danger reaches the scientist first, and they begin destroying the lunar base to prevent Jack from escaping. Jack reaches Danger Danger's rocket seconds before it lifts-off. The effects of the rocket's propulsion and the base's explosion send Jack floating through space on a collision course with the Sun. \"Il Pazzo\" (Italian for \"The Crazy One\"), leader of Danger Danger, begins dispatching men to kill Jack, but he fails, and Jack floats to the other rocket, which had been floating among the debris of the base.\n\nJack crashes his rocket into the Italian countryside of Tuscany. \"Il Pazzo\" is nearby with Dr. Harij, and he flees on a gondola. Jack steals a machine gun-equipped Vespa and pursues them. After killing hordes of \"Il Pazzo's\" men, Jack arrives at a castle where \"Il Pazzo\" is holed up with Dr. Harij. Using cannons positioned around the building, Jack kills the defenders. A long-distance battle ensues between Jack and \"Il Pazzo\". Jack wins, but is not able to kill Il Pazzo completely. After rescuing Dr. Harij, Jack is shot by Volkov and left to die. The game ends with Jack rising up and limping toward Volkov's skis. It is believed that the ending implied why Volkov is confined in a wheel chair and covered in a full-body plaster cast in \"No One Lives Forever 2\".\n\nContract J.A.C.K. uses the same Lithtech Jupiter engine as used in the base release of \"\", however, none of the upgrade paths that are available to boost abilities in the latter are present in J.A.C.K.\n\n\"Contract J.A.C.K.\" received mixed reviews with an aggregate score of 52.03% on GameRankings and 56/100 on Metacritic.\n\n"}

It furnishes the principal road connection between those two communities and passes through a primarily suburban region north of Fort Collins, along the east side of Terry Lake, where it is becomes Terry Lake Drive. Northward, it passes south of Waverly and south of the WWV radio towers, which are visible from the road. In Wellington, it becomes Cleveland Avenue, a readily used road in that town. Although the area running aside the road was traditionally agricultural, it has been the site of rapid housing growth in recent years, particularly near Wellington.\n\nThe route was numbered in the 1920s. During that time, it followed US 85 from New Mexico to I-25, where it continued north along US 85 to Denver, and began as various roads throughout the city that merged. It then paralleled the current route of US 287 towards Fort Collins, then along its current route from Fort Collins to Wellington. From Wellington, it followed various roads back to the current I-25, where it continued north and terminated at the Wyoming border. By 1938, the entire route was paved as part of a major project. In 1954, a section north of Fort Collins was removed, leaving only the portion south of that point. In 1957, the portion north of Fort Collins was returned to the route. However, the entire portion from Fort Collins to the New Mexico border was closed in 1968. Since then, the routing has not significantly changed.\n\n"}

He was the foreign exchange student in a group of six local teenagers.\n\nFez was born on August 4, 1960. His real name is deemed unpronounceable by his friends, so they call him \"Fez\" (short for Foreign Exchange Student). The series' official web site explains the spelling \"Fez\" (as opposed to \"Fes\") as \"poetic license\". Red usually calls him \"the foreign kid\", or by a random foreign (or Native American) name through various backgrounds (e.g., Hadji, Tonto, Anwar, Sabu, Muhammad Ali, Ali Baba, Pelé, Ahmad, Tutankhamun, etc.), which Fez does not mind, with one exception: he hates being called Tarzan because Tarzan is a white man. Eric's grandmother calls him \"Desi\".\n\nA flashback episode shows when Fez first meets the others ( except Jackie ). In 1976 , Kelso , Hyde and Eric rescue him from a janitor's closet where several bullies have hung him on a coat hook. The bullies had asked him if he wanted to hang out; he tells the group he \"shouldn't have said yes\". Moments later, he states his real name, which is drowned out by a long, ringing school bell (what Valderrama was actually saying was the first names of the main actors who appear in the show), after which Hyde (hearing the name) says \"OK... I'm not going to remember that.\" He along with Hyde later walks in on Donna naked in the episode when he first met her in 1976. (Kelso unfortunately misses the opportunity to see her naked. ) Jackie met him in the pilot episode at 'The Hub 'as the gang are planning to go to a Todd Rundgren concert. The only known fact about his name is, as he states in the episode \"Killer Queen\", the first five K's of his last name are silent. His name has no consonants, only vowels.\n\nValderrama has stated that he fabricated the accent he used on the show so that no one could identify which country his character is from, a mystery the show creators deliberately kept a secret.\n\nFez's host parents, Matthew (Kevin Farley) and Rebecca Erdman (Shannon Holt) appear in episodes \"Career Day\" and \"Drive In\". They let Fez stay with them until he graduates from high school, they have shown to be Christian fundamentalist because they forbid Fez from listening to rock music for they believe it is \"the devil's music\". On Season 7, they found out he graduated a year ago and kicked him out of their house, this action forces Fez to rent an apartment along with Kelso and later Jackie in the final Season.\n\nFez's country of origin is one of the longest running gags on the show. Through all eight seasons, Fez's nationality remains a mystery, even to his closest friends, and the continual hints and clues Fez drops about his country only leave them more confused. In the episode \"Eric's Birthday,\" Kitty, fantasizing about Eric's friends causing trouble, imagines Fez saying, \"in my home country of...wherever it is I'm from; I can never tell...\" Much is revealed in the episode \"Love of My Life,\" where Fez's old friend Andrew (played by Justin Long) comes for a visit. In the first teaser, when Andrew suggests that he goes back home, he says \"Yes, I will go to Brazil...and then catch a flight home.\" In the final teaser, when Hyde finally asks them, \"Where the hell are you guys from?\", Andrew says that the name depends on whether you ask the British or the Dutch. But the British won't say it, Fez explains, because they hate the island, and no one understands a word the Dutch say. Andrew has a heavy British accent; Fez's explanation to this is that his friend is from the west side of the island. We also see throughout the show that Fez almost says where he is from but then stops right before he says it.\n\nFez is often assumed to be of Hispanic or Latino descent; it is never revealed if this is so, though earlier episodes, such as \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday,\" imply he can speak Spanish. In \"Eric's Burger Job,\" during a job interview at Fatso Burger, Fez claims he can speak Dutch. In \"The Immigrant Song\", Fez retells his catch phrase (\"I said good day!\") in his native tongue, which sounds like gibberish. On \"A Legal Matter\", he says 'Amedica' instead of America (though he can say United States).\n\nInitially burdened by cultural barriers, Fez is fascinated by American life and thinks the knowledge he gains from America makes him superior to other people from his island. In an early episode, he suggests he would one day return to his home country \"and rule with an iron fist.\" Fez is openly regarded as weird by his friends. He exhibits a creepy side, which manifests itself in Fez spying on Kelso and Eric when they are making out with their girlfriends (with Kelso even allowing him to do so). More than once he is caught hiding in Donna's closet, and towards the end of the series she doesn't even bother to kick him out because it happens so much. He frequently complains about being lonely and love-starved.\n\nLater on, Fez develops metrosexual habits, appreciating stylish clothes and at times appearing vain and narcissistic about his looks. He shares an antagonistic relationship with his landlord Fenton (played by Jim Rash) because of a previous dispute over what Fez described as \"a pair of pants that made my butt look like an oil painting.\" Fez shows off his superior dancing skills in numerous episodes.\n\nFez worked at DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) from season 5 to season 7, where he met Nina his short stint girlfriend. With Nina, Fez managed to lose his virginity. Fez continued to work there after finishing school and being granted a green card. In season 7, he chose to quit and work at a local hair-salon as a shampoo boy. He stayed there until the finale.\n\n"}

Located at the intersection of 207th Street and 10th Avenue in the Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, it is served by the 1 train at all times.\n\nThis station was completed in 1906, but since it was in a sparsely populated location, it did not open until April 1, 1907.\n\nA subway crash occurred at the station in 1916, in which one train telescoped into another train. One motorman was badly injured, and twelve of the more than 200 passengers on the trains suffered minor injuries.\n\nIn 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to stop at this station. Previously, the station could only hold six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000.\n\nThis elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks, with the center track not used in revenue service. Both platforms have beige windscreens and dark canopies (both of which are currently being replaced as part of a renovation project) in the center, and black steel waist-high fences at either end. The station name plates are in the standard black with white lettering.\n\nNorth of this station, there are two switches and a ramp to allow access from each of the three tracks to the 207th Street Yard, which runs along the east side of the line.\n\nThe 1991 artwork here is called \"Elevated Nature I-IV\" by Wopo Holup. It consists of two concrete panels with wooden frames on the southbound platform's station house. Each panel consists of eight squares depicting tree limbs. This artwork is also located at four other stations on this line.\n\nBoth platforms have one wooden adjacent station house in the center. However, only the southbound one is used for passenger service. Doors from the platform lead to a small waiting area, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth, one staircase going down to the southwest corner of 207th Street and Tenth Avenue, and a passageway leading to a staircase that goes down to the northwest corner.\n\nThe station house on the northbound platform is used for employees only. One exit-only turnstile at platform level leads to a staircase that goes down to the northeast corner of 207th Street and Tenth Avenue, while a High Entry/Exit Turnstile, also at platform level, leads to a staircase going down to the southeast corner.\n\n"}

He attended Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida and Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nIn his first semester at the University of Texas, Looney received four Fs and one D. Looney responded by dropping out and enrolling at Texas Christian University. He was eventually kicked out of that school and transferred to Cameron Junior College, where he played for Leroy Montgomery. He set a punting record in the 1961 Junior Rose Bowl, as his team won the junior college national championship. He made All-American with the University of Oklahoma in 1962, leading them to the Big Eight Conference championship. He played in only three games in 1963. Head coach Bud Wilkinson kicked him off the team after Looney netted four yards in six carries in a game against Texas. Looney did not get along with Wilkinson, and it was also alleged he had punched assistant coach Johnny Tatum, though Tatum debunked that claim.\n\nLooney was drafted in the first round (twelfth overall) of the 1964 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He was also selected in the sixth round of the 1964 AFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs, but chose to play in the NFL instead. He was with the Giants just 25 days before they traded him along with offensive lineman Lou Kirouac to the Baltimore Colts for wide receiver R.C. Owens and safety Andy Nelson during training camp on August 24, 1964. As a member of the Giants, Looney racked up a number of fines for violating team rules.\n\nLooney had only 23 carries with Baltimore that season. In November, he got into an argument about politics with a couple, then later that night, broke into their apartment with a friend and attacked them. He received one year's probation and a fine.\n\nThe Colts traded Looney and an undisclosed draft pick to the Detroit Lions following on June 3, 1965 for linebacker Dennis Gaubatz. He put together one good season, racking up 114 carries for 356 yards and five touchdowns. While with Detroit, Looney was told by coach Harry Gilmer to carry in a play to the quarterback. Looney refused and told Gilmer, \"If you want a messenger boy, call Western Union.\"\n\nDetroit traded Looney to the Washington Redskins, where he had an uneventful tenure. He had 55 carries for 178 yards. The only highlight of his time with the Redskins came on a play in which he did not even have the ball. He was pass protecting for quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, and ended up leveling an onrushing pass rusher with a right hook to the jaw. When he tried to renegotiate his contract, he was let go.\n\nIn 1968, Looney was called up by the United States Army to go to Vietnam. He joined a lawsuit that claimed that a reserve unit could not be sent to fight in an undeclared war, but it was defeated.\n\nWhen he returned to the United States, he signed on with the New Orleans Saints. He had three carries for -3 yards with the Saints that year, and retired after the season.\n\nLooney was ranked as the most uncoachable player in NFL history by NFL Films president Steve Sabol. He would often intentionally run the wrong way on plays in practice in order to make things more challenging for himself. He once skipped several practices. When questioned about his absences, he responded by saying, \"If practice makes perfect and perfection is impossible, why practice?\"\n\nAfter his retirement from football he converted to Hinduism and joined the Siddha Yoga movement led by Swami Muktananda. Stan Trout, a fellow convert, alleged that Looney was one of Muktananda's \"enforcers\" who intimidated people into obeying him.\n\nLooney pled guilty to illegal possession of a firearm in federal court on January 7, 1974. He was sentenced to three years' probation. On February 5, 1988, he received a presidential pardon from Ronald Reagan. Looney died at the age of 45, on September 24, 1988, near Luna Vista north of Terlingua, Texas, when his motorcycle ran off a rural highway and crashed into a fence.\n\nLooney was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of Don Looney, who played on the 1939 NCAA championship team of Texas Christian University, and played end for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1940.\nHe has a daughter, Tara, born in 1968.\n\n"}

Versions for the Game Boy, Game Gear and Philips CD-i were also released. The player is tasked with clearing out blocks and ghosts without them stacking to the top of the playfield — blocks can be cleared by matching them in horizontal rows, while ghosts can be cleared by placing down a Pac-Man piece that can eat them. It is the first game in the \"Pac-Man\" series to be released exclusively for home platforms.\n\n\"Pac-Attack\" is an adaptation of the 1992 game \"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle\", which was released for arcades in Japan and North America and the Super Famicom in Japan. Music was composed by Hiromi Shibano with cover art designed by Greg Martin. To promote the game's release, a contest was held in \"GameFan\" magazine that awarded cash prizes to players who submitted their highest scores. Critical reception for the game was mixed; while some disliked its lack of replay value and inferiority to games such as \"Tetris\" and \"Columns\", others praised it for its addictiveness and clever usage of the traditional \"Pac-Man\" gameplay. It has been ported to several systems and included in a number of \"Pac-Man\" and Namco compilations for multiple platforms.\n\n\"Pac-Attack\" is a falling tile puzzle game, often being compared to games such as \"Tetris\" and \"Columns\". The player drops down formations of blocks and ghosts onto a vertical-oriented playfield, the objective being to score as much points possible before the pieces reach the top of the screen. Blocks can be cleared by matching them in horizontal rows that touch both ends of the playfield, however ghosts can only be cleared by placing down a Pac-Man piece, which will eat any ghosts in his path. The direction that Pac-Man is facing will show which direction he will move — if he gets stuck in a spot with no ghosts left, Pac-Man disappears. Eating ghosts will cause a “fairy meter”, located at the left of the screen, to fill up — once the meter is full, a fairy piece will appear that clears any and all ghosts below it, which can be used to cause chain reactions.\n\nAlongside a standard single-player mode, a multiplayer mode is also included that pits two players against each other, the objective being to clear as many pieces possible while also causing additional pieces to stack up on the opponent's side. Clearing out blocks or ghosts will cause additional pieces to fall on the other player's side, and once the blocks in a player's side stack to the top, the other is deemed the winner. The game also features a Puzzle Mode, where the player is to clear out each ghost in a pre-set level in as few moves as possible. This mode spans 100 levels, and completing one will give the player a password that can be used to start at that stage again.\n\n\"Pac-Attack\" was released for both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in North America and Europe on October 10, 1993. Developed by Namco Hometek, the North American console division of Namco America, it is an adaptation of the 1992 arcade game \"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle\", released for arcades and the Super Famicom in Japan. The soundtrack was composed by Hiromi Shibano, while the cover art was designed by Greg Martin. To help promote the game's release, Namco hosted a contest in \"GameFan\" magazine where players could submit their scores to win prizes, the grand prize being a $500 gift certificate. Some European and Japanese releases were titled \"Pac-Panic\".\n\nVersions of \"Pac-Attack\" were released for the Game Boy and Game Gear in 1994, followed by a European-exclusive Philips CD-i conversion in 1995. The CD-i conversion features completely remade artwork. In 1998, the Genesis version was released for the PlayStation as part of the Japan-only compilation \"Namco Anthology 2\", alongside a remake featuring improved graphics and music. A Game Boy Color conversion was bundled with the original \"Pac-Man\" in 1999, titled \"Pac-Man: Special Color Edition\". The Genesis version is also included as an unlockable in the 2001 PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube compilation \"Namco Museum\", alongside the arcade game \"Pac-Mania\", and in the Game Boy Advance game \"Pac-Man Collection\" the same year. The \"Namco Anthology 2\" remake is an unlockable extra in \"Pac-Man World 2\". An iOS “demake” of the game, featuring graphics from the original \"Pac-Man\" arcade game, was released in 2010, later delisted from the App Store in 2015. The Genesis version is also included in the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC collection \"Pac-Man Museum\", released in 2014.\n\n\"Pac-Attack\" was met with a divided response from critics; while some praised its simplistic gameplay, colorful graphics and unique usage of Pac-Man characters, others criticized its lack of replay value and inferior quality to other puzzle games available, notably \"Dr. Mario\" and \"Tetris\". The Sega Genesis version has a 70% rating on aggregator site \"GameRankings\", while the SNES version has a 66%.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" stated that the Game Gear version was \"the type of puzzle game designed for Game Gear\" for its addictiveness and simplistic gameplay, while \"GamePro\" found the Genesis version's multiplayer to be the game's main selling point. \"GameFan\" was the most positive towards it in their review, favorably comparing it to \"Tetris\" for its addictiveness, multiplayer modes and interesting premise for a puzzle game. \"Sega Visions\" magazine liked the Game Gear's portability and interesting usage of the Pac-Man character, saying that it was \"sure to keep you busy.\" In a 1998 retrospective review, \"AllGame\" stated that the Game Gear version's simplistic-yet-addictive gameplay, multiplayer mode and clever usage of the \"Pac-Man\" gameplay made \"Pac-Attack\" one of the best titles for the system. Reviewing the iOS \"demake\", \"TouchArcade\" especially praised the game's Puzzle Mode for its unique gameplay, while also liking the game's \"sharp\" graphics and responsive controls.\n\n\"Total!! UK Magazine\" was particularly negative towards the game, calling it a \"loser\" for its similarity to games such as \"Tetris\" and \"tedious\" single-player mode. Japanese publication \"Famitsu\" stated that the game was not as refined as titles such as \"Tetris\" or \"Dr. Mario\", criticizing its gameplay for being bland and not having much replay value. Reviewing the Wii Virtual Console release of the SNES port, \"Eurogamer\" stated that the game's lack of depth and simplistic gameplay made it a hard sell compared to other similar falling-tile games on the market. \"IGN\" had a similar response, saying that players should instead wait for other similar games to hit the Wii Shop Channel for its frustrating gameplay and lack of replay value. In a retrospective review, \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" found the game inferior to other puzzle titles such as \"Dr. Mario\" and \"Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\", saying the multiplayer mode and gameplay became repetitive after a while, saying that the Puzzle Mode was the only part that had any replay value.\n"}

Wonka Bars appear in both film adaptations of the novel, \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), and the play, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical\" (2013) each with different packaging.\n\nVarieties of Wonka Bars were subsequently manufactured and sold in the real world, formerly by the Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestlé. These bars were discontinued in January 2010 due to poor sales.\n\nIn Roald Dahl's novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and its film adaptations, a Wonka Bar is a chocolate bar and Willy Wonka’s signature product, said to be the \"perfect candy bar\". The wrappers of the 1971 version are brown with an orange and pink border with a top hat over the \"W\" in Wonka, similar to the film's logo, and the chocolate bars resemble Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bars. In the 2005 version, the wrappers feature different shades of a color (depending on the type of chocolate bar) and are also more detailed, and the chocolate bars strikingly resemble king-sized Kit Kat chocolate bars, only slightly bigger. In the book, Grandpa Joe mentions that Mr. Wonka had invented over two hundred kinds of Wonka bars (though the actual number available varies, with four flavours in the 2005 film).\n\nThe consumer product Wonka Bar was a chocolate bar inspired by the novel and the films \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".\n\nThe Quaker Oats Company, which financed the 1971 film with US$3 million, originally created a chocolate bar in time to publicize the 1971 film. In the documentary \"Pure Imagination\", producer David L. Wolper claims the bar was released to stores, but quickly recalled due to a production problem.\n\nMade by Nestlé and sold under their Willy Wonka Candy Company brand, Wonka Bars sold in the United States until January 2010. Wonka Bars consisted of small graham cracker pieces dipped in milk chocolate. The brand was launched by Chicago's Breaker Confections in 1976, and purchased by Nestle in 1988.\n\nOther bars produced included Wonka Xploder, Wonkalate and Wonka Biscuits.\n\nTo promote the 2005 film adaptation, 5 Wonka products (including a Wonka bar) were packaged with a Golden Ticket, as in the novel and films. The Golden Ticket in a Wonka Bar entitled the winner to a $10000 cash prize. \n\nA Nestlé factory in Europe began producing Wonka Bars in the flavors and wrappers depicted in the 2005 film: Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, Nutty Crunch Surprise [without actual nuts] and Triple Dazzle Caramel.\n\nNestlé Japan also released some Wonka Bars, in two flavours, Whipple Scrumptious Caramel Delight and Mysterious Spit-Spat Bar. These bars feature a wrapper done in the same style as the bars that appear in the Tim Burton film adaptation. More flavors appeared, including Piritto Natty Bur, Edible Garden, Eureka Moment, Happy Go Lucky, and Making WoW! Nestlé Japan also released a toy truck containing these bars. However, they have since been discontinued after the sale to Ferrero.\n\nIn March 2010, Nestlé USA introduced a new line of chocolate bars named \"Wonka Exceptionals\", consisting of three varieties. The Wonka Scrumdiddlyumptious Chocolate Bar (based on a bar of the same name from the 1971 film) consists of bits of toffee, cookie and peanuts in milk chocolate. The Wonka Chocolate Waterfall Bar contains white chocolate swirled with milk chocolate, and the Wonka Domed Dark Chocolate Bar is made of dark chocolate topped with milk chocolate medallions. Wonka launched the product line with an in-package Golden Ticket sweepstakes. Ten Golden Tickets could be found in bars and bags of Wonka Exceptionals chocolates, and each ticket was worth a grand prize of a trip around the world. Recent new additions to the Wonka Exceptionals include Wonka Triple Dazzle Caramel, which consists of milk chocolate filled with caramel and a dash of sea salt (this variety had previously been produced to promote the 2005 film, where it consisted of caramel in \"white\" chocolate as opposed to milk), and Wonka Fantabulous Fudge, which consists of chocolate fudge in milk chocolate. These were discontinued in 2012.\n\nOn 9 August 2013, Nestle UK announced that the Wonka Bar was to return to the UK, after having not been sold since 2005. The new Wonka Bars are available in small individual bars and 100g big block bars. There are currently three flavours, Millionaire's Shortbread, Crème Brûlée and Chocolate Nice Cream. Crème Brûlée is not available in small bars and is only available in big block bars. The small individual bars went on sale on 16 September 2013 and the big block bars went on sale in October that year. They never sold in the United States and were discontinued due to falling sales.\n\nIn late 2013, Nestlé Australia and New Zealand introduced new additions to the Wonka Bar Line, 170g Big Blocks Bars which were released in four flavours, Wonka Triple Chocolate Whipple Bar, Nutty Crunchilicious, Caramel Hat Trick and Chocolate Tales Bar. More additions included Cookie Creamery, and Mudpuff Caramel Stuff, also released in smaller sizes. These also got discontinued later.\n\n"}

(novel)\n\nWhy Not Me? is a 1999 political satire novel by Al Franken.\n\nThe book is made up of three different sections. First is Franken's autobiography, \"Daring to Lead\". Second is a campaign diary, following Franken and his campaign staff across the primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. The final section, supposedly written by Bob Woodward, is a behind-the-scenes account of Franken's first hundred days as president, titled \"The Void\". There is also an epilogue, set several decades after the plot, giving historical perspective on the Franken presidency and Franken's post-presidential life.\n\nThe book starts with \"Daring to Lead\", Franken's campaign autobiography, in which he recounts his life from his childhood in the fictional town of Christhaven, Minnesota, to his college years, to his career on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\". We learn later from Franken's campaign diary that some parts of \"Daring to Lead\" are completely fabricated.\n\nThe diary describes Franken's experiences in the race. He starts out as a dark horse Democratic candidate, running on a single-issue platform (ATM fees). In the diary, Franken routinely insults the residents of New Hampshire and Iowa and describes numerous extramarital affairs, illegal actions, ridiculous campaign promises, and disastrous schemes designed to bolster Franken's poll numbers. Despite Franken's deceit, he is eventually given the Democratic nomination due to a rise in support after the Y2K bug creates glitches solely on ATMs. He is elected president in an unprecedented landslide victory.\n\n\"The Void\", a book supposedly written by Bob Woodward, describes Franken's brief and turbulent tenure at the White House. After Franken makes a bizarre inauguration speech apologizing for slavery, the resulting backlash sends Franken into depression. Franken's aides give him anti-depressant drugs, but this causes Franken to display strange behavior. Franken has himself cloned, punches Nelson Mandela in the stomach during a state meeting, and hatches a dangerous plan to assassinate Saddam Hussein by flying to Iraq and hitting him with a plaque that reads, \"World's Greatest Grandpa.\" Congress forms a committee to investigate Franken's mood swings, which leads to the unraveling of his administration. After his diary is publicized, Franken is forced to resign.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Franken's clone (parented by then-couple Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche) is now the head of Franken's presidential library. Franken's entire cabinet was impeached along with the President, and all served varied prison terms; Franken pardoned himself before resigning. Franken's term is revealed to have actually had some benefits: his campaign for Russia to enter NATO provides important global security; his Vice President, Joe Lieberman, turns out to be the greatest President in history and serves eighteen years in office; and his dismantling of the remains of the Glass–Steagall Act benefits his boosters in the insurance industry.\n\nMost of the characters in the book are real people, but the events are fictional.\n\n\nFranken writes his own character as a blowhard who does not fully understand political issues and who, therefore, falls back on such clichés as \"The United States is the only remaining Superpower.\"\n\nIn the (fictional) Franken diary, he uses initials to refer to various people and political blocs, such as \"O.\" for his fictional brother, Otto, and \"S.P.\" for the supposedly \"stupid people\" whom he meets every time he attends a political rally. He also uses initials to refer to various young women with whom he is having affairs, the fact of which he hopes to conceal from his wife.\n\nIn the first part of the book, he portrays his children, Thomasin and Joseph (real people), as being against his running for the Presidency.\n\nFranken correctly predicted that Joe Lieberman would be the Democratic Party's Vice Presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election.\n\nIn 2008, Franken officially announced his candidacy for Norm Coleman's Minnesota seat in the U.S. Senate in the 2008 election. He was eventually victorious, following a protracted recount.\n\nIn 2017, several columnists wrote about the possibility of Franken running in the 2020 United States presidential election, in spite of his dismissing the idea the prior year.\n\nIn 2017, Franken was accused by various women of sexual misconduct before and after his time as a U.S. Senator. This is similar to what he claims to do in the diary section of the book.\n"}

It operates as Alcampo in Spain (\"al campo\" is the literal Spanish translation of the French \"au champ\"), Auchan in Portugal, Aшан in Russia and Ukraine, and through a joint-venture as RT-Mart in China (Auchan brand is also used) and Taiwan.\n\nAs of 2019, Auchan is one of the world's largest retailers with a direct presence in France, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Hungary, China and Taiwan.\n\nAfter meeting the founders of the Carrefour and Leclerc, on July 6, 1961, Gérard Mulliez opens the first Auchan store in a disused factory of the company Phildar, founded by his father, also named Gerard. Covering an area of 600 m, this store was located in the district of Hauts-Champs, in Roubaix. Originally, the store was to be called \"Ochan\", but because of the Japanese sounding, changed the name to \"Auchan\". The choice of the initial letter \"A\" was desired by the founders to appear in first place in directories. Gerard Mulliez relied on the advice of Édouard Leclerc to open his first supermarket. This store had to be closed in the 1980s because of strong competition with the one that had been built in Leers. The building was bought by the Intermarché. In 2003 it was demolished to make space for a more modern store.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, on 20 August, Auchan opens its first hypermarket in Roncq in an initially commercial area of 3500 m. According to Gérard Mulliez, Roncq location served as a model for other hypermarkets in France in non-food enlargement. On March 27, 1969 was opened the Englos-les-Géants shopping center at Englos in the Lille metropolis. Englos les Giants was the first shopping mall with a hypermarket and a retail park in France.\n\nAuchan SA is controlled by the Mulliez family, one of the wealthiest in France and in Europe. The Mulliez family also owns Leroy Merlin, Decathlon Group and others retailers.\n\nAuchan opened its first store in Shanghai in 1999. It operates through Sun Art Retail Group, a public company listed in Hong Kong, in which Auchan holds 38,5% stake and Alibaba Group 26%.\n\nSuzhou Jinji Lake store that is located in Suzhou Industrial Park had nine million visitors during that fiscal year with over four hundred million turnover and became one of the biggest Auchan hypermarkets in the world. Suzhou store expanded in 2008 and is the biggest Auchan Hypermarket in China, the second biggest in the world. Also, Auchan China led to open its online shopping website for the stores in Shanghai and Suzhou.\n\nAuchan offers online shopping only in those two cities so far and is opening in Suzhou its first AuchanDrive store, based on its French model (click & go) in May 2012. The AuchanDrive service allows customers to purchase groceries online for home delivery, these locations being examples of online supermarkets in China.\n\nSince 2017, a number of unmanned convenience stores, marketed as BingoBox, are being operated by Auchan in China.\n\nAuchan (branded as Aшан) has been active on the Russian market since 2002 and had over 100 hypermarkets in the country by December 2016. It's the company's third largest market, after France and China. Revenues for the country reached $5 billion in 2014, ranking third behind the local retailers X5 Retail Group and Magnit. In 2016 it was ranked first in a list of the largest foreign-owned companies by the Russian edition of Forbes.\n\nAuchan Holding is composed by Auchan Retail, Ceetrus and Oney.\n\nCeetrus (former Immochan) is the division which operates shopping centers and hypermarket galleries.\n\nOney (former Bank Accord) is the financial services group that offers consumer credits and Auchan and Leroy Merlin credit cards to 7,6 million clients in 11 countries.\n\nThe slogan of the company was \"La Vie, La Vraie\", which translates into English as \"Life, the real one\". The slogan was changed in 2007 to: \"La vie Auchan, elle change la vie\" – \"Auchan's lifestyle changes life (itself).\n\n\nAuchan opened a number of stores in Mexico; the first of these opened in Mexico City in 1997 and eventually grew to five stores. Faced with stiff competition from Wal-Mart, as well as local superstore chains Gigante and Comercial Mexicana, and French rival Carrefour (who also sold their stores and left the country in March 2005), Auchan decided to sell their stores to Comercial Mexicana and withdrew from Mexico in early 2003, most of these stores were sold to Soriana in 2015.\n\nIn 1997 Auchan sold its hypermarkets in Thailand to Groupe Casino.\n\nIn 2007 Auchan sold its Argentine stores to Wal-Mart and withdrew from the country.\n\nFollowing a conflict with its Moroccan partner ONA, Auchan sold its 49% share in August 2007.\n\nIn January 2011 Auchan dropped out of the Dubai market after just two years.\n\nIn 2019 Auchan withdrawn from Italy due to financial losses, by selling most of the activities of its Auchan Retail Italia to the Italian retailer Conad. \nAlso withdraw from Vietnam due to losses and slow development.\n\nAuchan previously did business in the United States from 1988 to 2003 as Auchan Hypermarket under its subsidiary, Auchan USA, who was the successor of interest to Texfield Inc. By the time of its closing it was the only French hypermarket chain to still operate American stores, as other hypermarket chains, such as Carrefour and E.Leclerc (under the guise of Leedmark) gave up in the United States market around \n1993-1994.\n\nThe first American Auchan (pronounced by Houstonians as “o-shawn”) store opened in western Houston on October 14, 1988. The hypermarket was located on a plot of land on Beltway 8, north of U.S. Route 59/Interstate 69. The store was one of many hypermarkets to open in the U.S in the late 80's,\nafter Walmart debuted Hypermart USA in December 1987, and Carrefour's Philadelphia store debuted in March 1988. David Kaplan of the \"Houston Chronicle\" said \"it was fairly unusual and became something of a tourist attraction\" when it had first opened, as it was big enough to house lots of small businesses in front, such as a travel agency, a jewelry store, a bank, and a food court containing a Taco Bell, McDonald's, and Pizza Hut. It also featured a huge cheese selection, a huge beer and wine selection, featuring local breweries such as Celis White, and a bakery, and like most hypermarkets operating in the U.S. in the late ’80s, as well as Aldi, Auchan also made customers use quarters to use the shopping carts, and in order to appeal to Houstonians, it had a huge seafood selection, as well as rodeo wear.\n\nAuchan also opened a store in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois, in 1989. It only sold food, and it was not as large as the Houston store. In 1991 the store closed. It was later bought by a local Chicago supermarket chain, Dominick's, and converted into an Omni Superstore by 1991.\n\nAuchan's second Greater Houston location opened in southeast Houston in September 2000, in a former Target store, which Auchan heavily renovated (and partially built up on) prior to opening, the most obvious example being the entrances, designed to make it look huge, despite its past as a Target. Kaplan said, \"Auchan had solid business its first years, but with only two stores in the country, the company lacked buying power and economy-of-scale advantages.\" In early January 2003 Auchan announced that both of its U.S. stores were making losses and were going to be closed; Auchan stated that it was instead going to concentrate its expansion in Asia and Europe, and on January 6, 2003, Auchan closed the two money-losing stores, ending all American operations after 15 years. Auchan USA sold its first Houston location to Ho Enterprises. Lewis Food Town occupied about of the space, with the rest of the space taken by other tenants, which makes the store a bit like a mini-mall today. Kaplan said that by 2003, \"the Houston market is saturated with huge discounters and large grocery stores.\" In addition, many similar stores, including an H-E-B Food and Drug Store, the Hong Kong Supermarket, a Sam's Club, and a Wal-Mart had opened in proximity to the west Houston Auchan. In Europe, zoning laws would prevent such a high concentration of similar stores. Kaplan further added that \"In Europe, shopping malls are not as prevalent as they are in America, and Auchan's everything-under-one-roof concept has greater appeal\" in Europe rather than in the United States. The second former Auchan is now used by a local scaffolding company, and was used as a shelter for Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005 and Hurricane Ike victims in 2008 due to its large space.\n\nAccording to study by ASM Sales Force Agency, Auchan was cheapest shop in Poland, in class of shops that study checks.\n\nOn 24 April 2013, the eight-story \"Rana Plaza\" commercial building collapsed in Savar, a sub-district near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. At least 1,127 people died and over 2,438 were injured. The factory housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank and manufactured apparel for brands including the Benetton Group, Joe Fresh, The Children's Place, Primark, Monsoon, and DressBarn. Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only 9 attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign including Walmart, Carrefour, Mango, Auchan and Kik. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarché and El Corte Ingles.\n\n\n"}

Hugely influential in the folk-revival, it was often controversial. Issues of what is folk music, what is folk rock, and \"who\" is folk were roundly discussed and debated. At the same time, \"Broadside\" nurtured and promoted important singers of the era.\n\nThe mimeograph machine used to produce the magazine had been discarded by the American Labor Party. The mixture of hand-drawn musical notation, typewriter text, and the occasional hand-drawn illustration or photocopied news story anticipated a look that would be more common in zines 20 years later.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, \"Broadside\" had essentially ceased publication.\n\nMany of the songs recorded for \"Broadside\" over its lifetime were released in 2000 as \"The Best of Broadside\" as a 5-CD boxed set. The many Broadside albums originally released by Folkways are now available through Smithsonian Folkways here: https://folkways.si.edu/search?query=broadside \n\nThe Broadside archives, including all the reel-to-reel tapes of music (many of which have been digitized) are housed at the University of Carolina (see External links below). Also, a complete archive of all the magazines can be found here: https://singout.org/broadside/\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"Broadside\" put out three folio-sized trade paperback songbooks, \"Broadside Volume 1\" (Oak Publications, 1964), \"Broadside Volume 2\" (Oak, 1968, ), and \"Broadside Volume III\" (Oak, 1970, ). Each contained slightly under 100 songs, photo-reproduced from the original magazine. The first volume had a sewn binding, although the latter two used the glued binding more common for trade paperbacks.\n\nEach volume featured a foreword, the first by Cunningham, the second by Friesen, and the third by Irwin Silber.\n\nAs Irwin Silber wrote in his foreword to \"Broadside Volume III\", \"A whole generation of song-writers, some of whom have become household names in the America of the 1960s, made their first appearances in \"Broadside\"…\" Among those whose careers began there, Silber listed Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs (a major \"Broadside\" contributor; see also \"Sings for Broadside\" (Folkways, 1976) and \"The Broadside Tapes 1\" (Folkways, circa 1980), Buffy Sainte-Marie, Janis Ian (originally under her real name, Janis Fink), and Arlo Guthrie.\n\nOther, more established songwriters also contributed to \"Broadside\", some of them (in Silber's words again) with \"songs which commercial publishers didn't know what to do with…\" Among these, Silber lists Pete Seeger, Nina Simone, Billy Edd Wheeler, and Malvina Reynolds.\n\n\"Broadside\" generally eschewed rock music, including rock songs with political and social themes. One notable exception was the magazine's publication of the Black Sabbath song \"War Pigs\".\n\nCunningham herself published a number of songs in \"Broadside\". Other contributors to \"Broadside\" included:\n\nThe magazine was revived, around 1982, by Norman Ross of Clearwater Publishing (a microfiche publication and distribution company) as a part of the upswing in folk and political music of the times.\n\nIn his parody song, \"Vaguely Reminiscent of the Sixties\", Charlie King captured the era of singer/songwriter and social movements that had helped to bring about many social changes. Music was a firm part of these movements and was frequently included in meetings, protests, seminars, teach-ins and other activities.\n\n\"Broadside\" in the 1980s, edited by Jeff Ritter, a musician and graduate student at the time, covered multiple movements and songwriters including Arlo Guthrie, Billy Bragg, Michelle Shocked, Charlie King, Holly Near and more. The revival of the Newport Folk Festival coincided with this era and many singer-songwriters who began at this time continued their involvement with the music industry.\n\nThe August, 1985, issue #165, guest edited by Charles Ipcar, focused on housing and other neighborhood organizing songs. Songwriters included Langston Huges, Charlie Ipcar & Maxine Parshall, Dale Cohen & Hugh McGuinness, Bob Norman, Mark Charles & Sheila Ritter, Peter Berryman, Elyse Crystall, Sandee Swantek, Martha Koester, Paul Emery, Tony Heriza, Judith Levine & Laura Liben, Mike Rawson, Bev Grant, and Luci Murphy.\n\nPublication ended in the late 1980s.\n\nAs of 2007, \"Broadside\" Magazine is being revived online at broadsidemagazine.com. New articles are being featured by contributing writers and past editors, and all previous issues of the magazine are available for free download in PDF format.\n\n"}

{"id": "1981261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981261", "title": "Half-arch (crown)", "text": "Half-arch (crown)\n\nA half-arch is the piece of gold, silver or platinum, usually decorated with jewels, that links the circlet (circular base) of a hoop crown to the monde at the top of the crown.\n\nIn the image of the Crown of Queen Elizabeth (1938), there are four half-arches, reflecting the examples of St. Edward's Crown, the State Crown of George I, the Coronation Crown of George IV and the Imperial State Crowns of Queen Victoria (1838) and George VI (1937).\n\nSimilarly other consort crowns of queens consort Mary of Modena and Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the Crown of Mary of Modena and the Crown of Queen Adelaide, were made up of four half-arches, following British tradition.\n\nThe only example of a crown of a reigning British monarch possessing more than four half-arches is the Imperial Crown of India, made for King George V as Emperor of India to wear at the Delhi Durbar of 1911, and which had eight half-arches.\n\nThe three crowns in existence of the Prince of Wales, the Heir Apparent to the British throne, all have one full arch, with a globe centred on the single arch rather than being the element to which each arch separately is joined, following an instruction laid down by King Charles II in 1677. Unlike the princely crowns of 1902 and 1969 however, where the single arch rises, in the Crown of Frederick, Prince of Wales (1728) the single arch dips in the centre, with the globe located in the centre of the dip.\n\nIn contrast many European crowns traditionally contained many more, as did some other British consort crowns. For example, The crowns of two 20th century British Queens consort, the Crown of Queen Alexandra (1902) and the Crown of Queen Mary (1911), reflecting their origins as European princesses from Denmark and Germany respectively, each had eight half-arches. In addition, the British Imperial Crown of India was designed with eight half-arches to indicate the British monarch's claim to imperial title in India.\n\nThe Crown of Louis XV of France (1722), reflecting the European norm, has eight half-arches.\n\nDifferent crowns possess different shaped half arches. In some crowns, the half-arches dip down at the centre of the crown where they meet the globe. The most widely recognized example of this is St. Edward's Crown, the British coronation crown, while in others, such as Queen Elizabeth's consort crown, all four half-arches rise at a somewhat right angle, with no central dip.\n\nHowever, in the case of the State Crown of George I, while the crown as originally designed had dipping arches, they were pulled up to a right angle for the coronation of King George II and have remained in that position.\n\nIn some crowns, such as the British Imperial State Crown, the half-arches are detachable, allowing the crown to be worn as a circlet. Alexandra of Denmark, Mary of Teck and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (British queens consort Alexandra, Mary and Elizabeth) all at various stages wore their own crowns as circlets, particularly after the deaths of the husbands, when one of their children was on the throne and they were the Queen Mother.\n\nWhere a crown possesses arches or half-arches, the circlet of the crown below the arches or half-arches are usually filled with velvet or other cloth, or with a jewelled metal cap. Different states and different crowns may possess different coloured cloth inlays.\n\nThe most widely used colours for cloth infills are purple, as in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth and in St. Edward's Crown, and dark red, as in the Imperial Crown of Austria. \n\nNot all crowns possess arches. The Danish Crown of Christian IV that was used for the coronation of elected monarchs prior to the introduction of absolutism in 1660 has no covering at all but exists in circlet form, while the Papal Tiara rises as one solid silver (or in one occasion gold) unit. Nor are arches to be found on the Iron Crown of Lombardy, any of the Iranian Crown Jewels. The Russian coronation crown possesses two central half arches, with most of the rest of the crown covered in. A same feature occurs on the mediaeval Crown of Rudolf II used by the Austrian Empire in the 19th century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1981274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981274", "title": "Robert V. Remini", "text": "Robert V. Remini\n\nRobert Vincent Remini (July 17, 1921 – March 28, 2013) was an American historian and a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He wrote numerous books about President Andrew Jackson and the Jacksonian era, most notably a three-volume biography of Jackson. For the third volume of \"Andrew Jackson\", subtitled \"The Course of American Democracy, 1833-1845\", he won the 1984 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. Remini was widely praised for his meticulous research on Jackson and thorough knowledge of him. His books portrayed Jackson in a mostly favorable light and he was sometimes criticized for being too partial towards his subject.\n\nRemini also wrote biographies of other early 19th century Americans, namely Martin Van Buren, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, and Joseph Smith. He served as Historian of the United States House of Representatives from 2005 until 2010 and wrote a history of the House, which was published in 2006.\n\nRobert Vincent Remini was born on July 17, 1921 in New York City. His parents were William Remini and Loretta Tiernay Remini, and he was the elder brother of William and Vincent Remini. His father worked as a credit manager for a coal company. Remini recalled that his original plan in life was to become a lawyer. He explained that this was \"not because [he] was intrigued by the law, but because it seemed like a worthy profession then for a child of the Great Depression.\" Remini received his B.S. from Fordham University in 1943. He then enlisted in the United States Navy and was involved in anti-submarine warfare during World War II. His reading of history while in the Navy caused him to want to be a historian. \"I remember we docked at Boston and I went to the library and took out all nine volumes of Henry Adams' history of the U.S. under Jefferson and Madison,\" he told the \"Chicago Tribune\". \"I loved it. Right then I realized that by God, it was history I loved, not law.\" \"When I told my parents, they were shocked,\" Remini recalled. \"'Oh!' they said. 'You will starve.'\" Remini married Ruth T. Kuhner, whom he had met in kindergarten, in 1948 and they had three children: Elizabeth Nielson, Joan Costello, and Robert W. Remini.\n\nRemini received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1947 and his PhD from Columbia in 1951. At Columbia, he studied under historian Richard Hofstadter. Hofstadter suggested that he write his dissertation on Martin Van Buren. The dissertation eventually turned into his first book, \"Martin Van Buren and the Making of the Democratic Party\" (1959). The book examines Van Buren's role in building a cross-sectional coalition which formed the foundation for the rise of Jacksonian democracy and the eventual creation of the Democratic Party. Remini was named an assistant professor of history at Fordham in 1951 and remained there until 1965. Historian Richard K. McMaster, who graduated from Fordham University in 1962, wrote in 2009 that Remini was great at \"making American history an interesting story.\" McMaster said, \"I remember him as a remarkably kind man, genuinely interested in his students and encouraging of our efforts at research. He had the uncanny ability to present the Age of Jackson with such immediacy that you might think he'd had lunch in the Ramskeller with Martin Van Buren. He is an American treasure.\"\n\nIn 1965, Remini joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago, then known as the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC). He was the school's first chairman of the History Department, serving in that role from 1965 until 1971. Remini later founded the UIC Institute for the Humanities, which he chaired from 1981 to 1987. Remini retired in 1991. During his career, he served as a visiting professor at the Jilan University of Technology in China, the University of Richmond, the University of Notre Dame, and Wofford College. When writing history, Remini employed self-discipline to try to better himself. \"I was trained by Jesuits, and you were rewarded if you did good and punished if you did bad,\" he said. \"I decided that I had to write nine pages a day. And if I did, I got a martini. If not, I didn't.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a measure introduced by Representative John B. Larson, a former high school history teacher, directing the Librarian of Congress to facilitate the writing of a history of the House of Representatives. Remini was then asked by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington to write a Congressional history, \"The House\". Remini accepted the task and the book was published in 2006. The book was considered to be \"nonpartisan, readable, and stocked with memorable characters.\" The work led to his appointment as Historian of the United States House of Representatives by Speaker Dennis Hastert on April 28, 2005. He was 83 at the time of his appointment. As House Historian, Remini was credited for his non-partisanship, especially after previous House Historians had been fired over partisan issues. He enjoyed visiting the Library of Congress as House Historian. \"He was like a kid in a candy shop,\" said his daughter, Joan Costello. \"He was so tickled and thrilled to be able to read the rare books, documents and letters available to only a few.\" He retired in 2010 and was succeeded by Matthew Wasniewski.\n\nRemini's wife died in May 2012 at the age of 90. Remini died the following year at Evanston Hospital in Evanston, Illinois on March 28, 2013 after a stroke. He was 91.\n\nRemini is best known for his work on America's seventh President Andrew Jackson. After his book on Van Buren, he initially planned on writing a full biography of him until deciding to write about Jackson instead. In the 1960s, Remini wrote a series of short books about Jackson, which were \"The Election of Andrew Jackson\" (1963), \"Andrew Jackson\" (1966), and \"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War\" (1967).\n\nRemini's initial books on Andrew Jackson convinced him to write a fuller account of the man's life. This led to the writing of his book \"Andrew Jackson,\" published in three volumes (1977, 1981, 1984), which is considered his \"magnum opus.\" It was originally conceived as a single volume, but Remini tried to convince his editor, Hugh Van Dusen, to allow for two. He at first refused, saying, \"I can't sell two volumes.\" Remini recalled, \"We were sitting there in the middle of \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and he turned to me and he said, 'You can have two volumes,' and that was the beginning of it. Then, when the presidential years grew to be more than another volume, I needed a third volume. I took him to see \"Tristan und Isolde\" — and it worked!\" The finished series totaled approximately 1,600 pages. \"There was an electrifying dynamism about Jackson that I found irresistible,\" Remini said. He went on to call him \"the embodiment of the new American.\" He added, \"This new man was no longer British. He no longer wore the queue and silk pants. He wore trousers, and he had stopped speaking with a British accent.\"\n\nRemini's books on Jackson have generally received praise. Jon Meacham read Remini's trilogy in high school and later wrote his own biography of Jackson, which Remini read in manuscript form. Meacham said, \"He was practicing a kind of narrative historical biographical craft at exactly the moment when most of the academy was moving toward intellectual and group-driven history.\" He described Remini as \"someone who never believed that his interpretation was the last word.\" Meacham continued, \"You cannot write about Jackson without standing on Remini's shoulders.\" Daniel Walker Howe, a historian who took a rather critical view of Jackson, speaks favorably of Remini, writing: \"A forthright admirer of his subject, Remini is laudatory in his assessments of Jackson's achievements. At the same time, he is also a meticulous scholar who does not allow his prejudices to get in the way of the evidence he finds.\" Of Remini's trilogy, Joel H. Silbey says that \"one comes away with the feeling that here is how Jackson saw himself, might have set forth his won case, and wished to be remembered.\" In his own biography of Jackson, historian H. W. Brands calls Remini's three volume series \"[a] monumental work of research and exposition by the dean of Jackson studies.\" The final volume, \"Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Democracy, 1833-1845\", won the 1984 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\nWhile Remini has been credited for his unique focus on Jackson the individual, he has also received criticism for seeing things too much from Jackson's point of view and for identifying too closely with his subject. \"No historian knows more about Andrew Jackson than Robert V. Remini,\" John William Ward, also a Jackson biographer, wrote in a 1981 review of the second volume of the Jackson trilogy, \"Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Freedom, 1822-1833\". He added that Remini \"has mastered in all their complex detail the many issues and events of Jackson's private and public life, but in doing so he has come to see the world too much from Jackson's point of view.\" \"Seeing the world through Old Hickory's eyes, we appreciate him as a complex human being,\" history professor Andrew R.L. Cayton wrote in a \"New York Times\" book review of Remini's \"Andrew Jackson and his Indian Wars\" (2001). \"The problem . . . is that we see the world only through Jackson's eyes.\" A 1984 review by James M. Banner of the \"New York Times\" of the final volume of Remini's Jackson trilogy says that \"he cannot be said to be respectful of interpretations more skeptical than his own, nor of being detached.\" Banner argues that Remini's work is \"a biography of the old school, governed by an old strategy and unabashed in its sympathies.\" He concludes by declaring that Remini's three volumes are not \"the right vehicle for what we need.\" \n\nRemini took a moderate view of Jackson's behavior during the Bank War. He believed that the Bank had \"too much power, which it was obviously using in politics. It had too much money which it was using to corrupt individuals. And so Jackson felt he had to get rid of it. It is a pity because we do need a national bank, but it requires control.\" He refuted the idea that the collapse of the Bank was responsible for the Panic of 1837, which he describes as \"a world-wide economic collapse\", but conceded that it \"may have exacerbated\" the crisis. Remini partially defended Jackson's Indian removal policies. He held that had Jackson not orchestrated the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from their ancestral homelands, they would have been totally wiped out, just like other tribes-namely, the Yamasee, Mahican, and Narragansett–which did not move. In his review of \"Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars,\" Andrew Denson criticizes Remini's \"silly\" conclusion that Jackson's support for Indian removal saved the Indians from extinction, pointing to the continued existence of other Indian communities east of the Mississippi River as evidence to the contrary.\n\nRemini wrote a one-volume abridgment to the original three-volume series, called \"The Life of Andrew Jackson,\" which was published in 1988. He delivered a lecture on Jackson at the White House in 1991.\n\nRemini also wrote biographies of other prominent Americans of the early 19th century, namely Martin Van Buren, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, and Joseph Smith. His 1991 biography of Clay, entitled \"Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union,\" was well-received. Brian Boylan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" credits Remini for the ability to write a fair biography of Clay even after his extensive work on Jackson, who was Clay's \"bitter enemy.\" Remini \"treats Clay with such affection and care that after half a century of being a vague name in pre-Civil War American history, Henry Clay springs to life in all his fascinating brilliance.\" Historian Otis A. Singletary writes that the biography of Clay was \"thoroughly researched and written in a lively and engaging style.\" Remini enjoyed recounting how, once when he was delivering a speech on the steps of Clay's home Ashland, a large thunderclap struck, which he regarded as a sign of Jackson's disapproval. The biography of Webster, published in 1997 as \"Daniel Webster: The Man and His Time\", won the D.B. Hardeman Prize.\n\nIn 2008, Remini published \"A Short History of the United States,\" which was just under 400 pages long. According to a book review:\nHis last work was \"At the Edge of the Precipice: Henry Clay and the Compromise that Saved the Union\" (2010). In a review of the book, Russell McClintock praises Remini for his engaging writing style and depiction of Clay, which he calls \"both heroic and credible,\" but accuses him of overemphasizing the importance of compromise and overlooking times when it did not work. McClintock summarized his thoughts by calling the book \"a concise and lively account of a critical but understudied episode that, while it breaks no new scholarly ground, does raise valuable points about the importance of compromise in republican government.\"\n\nThe following is a list of all of the books written by Remini.\n\n\n"}
