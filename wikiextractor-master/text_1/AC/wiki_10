It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).\n\nBhatpara is situated on the bank of Hooghly river. It is known for its rich traditions in the field of Sanskrit learning. The name 'Bhatpara' originates from the ancient name \"Bhatta-Palli\", where 'Bhatta' denotes the sect of Bramhin Sanskrit pandits and 'palli' denotes locality or village. It is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal and it was constituted a municipality in 1899, when it was separated from the Naihati municipality. In the British era and afterwards, it had become an important industrial hub on Hoogly river bank, mainly for the high density of jute processing plants.\n\nBhatpara is located at . It has an average elevation of 12 metres (39 feet). The main town is sandwiched between the Hoogly river in the west and railway track linking Sealdah and Krishnanagar in the east.\n\nBhatpara is bounded by Naihati and Dogachhia on the north, Panpur, Rambati, Mukundapur, Abhirampur, Keutia, Bidydharpur, Rahuta, Basudevpur and Gurdaha on the east, Kaugachhi, Garshyamnagar and Garulia on the south and the Hooghly on the west. Although not specifically spelled out, it is evident that localities such as Jagatdal, Kankinara, Shyamnagar, Authpur, Milangar and Sahebbagan are neighbourhoods in Bhatpara.\n\n96% of the population of Barrackpore subdivision (partly presented in the map alongside) live in urban areas. In 2011, it had a density of population of 10,967 per km The subdivision has 16 municipalities and 24 census towns.\n\nJagaddal police station under Barrackpore Police Commissionerate has jurisdiction over Bhatpara Municipal area.\n\nBhatpara has a delivery sub post office, with PIN 743123 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. The only other post office with the same PIN is Muktarpur.\n\nESD M, a delivery sub post office in the Jagatdal area has PIN 743124 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. There is no other post office with the same PIN.\n\nJagatdal has a delivery sub post office, with PIN 743125 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. Other post offices with the same PIN are Golghar and Gupter Bagan.\n\nKankinara has a delivery sub post office, with PIN 743126 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. Other post office with the same PIN are Keotia, Kushdanga, Madral, Narayanpur and Padmalavapur.\n\nWhile Shyamnagar has a delivery sub post office Mulajore has a non-delivery sub post office, both with PIN 743127 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. Other post offices with the same PIN are Kowgachhi, Paltapara, Feeder Road, Gurdah, Mondalpara and Purbabidhyadharpur.\n\nAthpur has a delivery sub post office, with PIN 743128 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. There is no other post office with the same PIN.\n\nFingapara has a delivery sub post office, with PIN 743129 in the North Presidency Division of North 24 Parganas district in Kolkata region. There is no other post office with the same PIN.\n\nBhatpara has hot and humid summer and dry winter, typical of West Bengal. The rainy season is typically from mid-July to mid- or late October. Average temperature during summer can go as high as 38 degree Celsius and in winter the mercury plunges to below 10 degree Celsius. Humidity, in the time of summer, is often above 90% and is the primary reason of discomfort.\n\nAs per the 2011 Census of India, Bhatpara (municipal area + outgrowth) had a total population of 386,019, of which 204,539 (53%) were males and 181,480 (47%) were females. Population in the age range of 0-6 years was 35,5141. The total number of literates in Bhatpara was 297,161 (84.78% of the population 7 years and over).\n\nAs of 2001 India census, Bhatpara had a population of 441,956. Males constituted 55% of the population and females 45%. Bhatpara had an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 78% and female literacy of 66%. 9% of the population was under 6 years of age.\n\nThe jute mills drew in a large labour force from the neighbouring states of Bihar and Odisha, as well as eastern Uttar Pradesh, quite often forming an overwhelming majority of the population in the area, living in shanty towns and slums dotting the jute mill area of Kankinara.\n\nThe educated, middle-income, and predominantly Bengali populace lives in the old town area.\n\nAccording to a study carried out by Vidyasagar University, \"Most of these industrial units were located in riverine towns. A few of these were old towns inhabited previously by middle class Bengali 'babus' while others were new towns grown out of agricultural lands... Agriculture in Bengal was more remunerative than work in the jute mills but what the jute mills paid was enough to attract labour from Bihar, Orissa, U.P. first and then from C.P. or even Madras...The industrial 'mohallas' remained as 'ghettos'. There was little or no interconnection or social and cultural contact between local Bengali population and the mill hands. Both lived in their own worlds.\"\n\nThe following Municipalities, Census Towns and other locations in Barrackpore subdivision were part of Kolkata Urban Agglomeration in the 2011 census: Kanchrapara (M), Jetia (CT), Halisahar (M), Balibhara (CT), Naihati (M), Bhatpara (M), Kaugachhi (CT), Garshyamnagar (CT), Garulia (M), Ichhapur Defence Estate (CT), North Barrackpur (M), Barrackpur Cantonment (CB), Barrackpore (M), Jafarpur (CT), Ruiya (CT), Titagarh (M), Khardaha (M), Bandipur (CT), Panihati (M), Muragachha (CT) New Barrackpore (M), Chandpur (CT), Talbandha (CT), Patulia (CT), Kamarhati (M), Baranagar (M), South Dumdum (M), North Dumdum (M), Dum Dum (M), Noapara (CT), Babanpur (CT), Teghari (CT), Nanna (OG), Chakla (OG), Srotribati (OG) and Panpur (OG).\n\nAs per the District Census Handbook 2011, Bhatpara (municipality + outgrowth) covered an area of 34.69 km. Amongst the civic amenities it had 60 km of roads and both open and closed drains. Amongst the medical facilities, it had 32 dispensaries/ health centres, 1 veterinary hospital, 5 charitable hospitals/ nursing homes and 32 medicine shops. Amongst the educational facilities It had 195 primary schools, 11 middle schools, 24 secondary schools, 21 senior secondary schools, 17 non-formal education centres and 1 special school for disabled. Amongst the social, recreational and cultural facilities it had 4 auditorium/ community halls, 23 cinema/theatres, 10 public libraries and 10 reading rooms. Amongst the commodities manufactured were jute, tyre and battery. It had 6 bank branches.\n\nAccording to the Barrackpore administration, amongst the educational facilitites at Bhatpara are 135 primary schools, 10 secondary schools and 35 higher secondary schools. Amongst the other facilities are 11 markets, 3 ferry ghats, 2 cinema halls, 2 auditoriums, 10 play grounds and 2 burning ghats. 27,932 houses had water connections and there were 4,950 street taps.\n\nSee also Cities and towns in Barrackpore subdivision\n\nEarlier, a significant portion of the population was engaged in some form of job in the local jute mills. Economic instability related to the jute industry in West Bengal forced many of these mills to be shut down. A large number of people of Bhatpara commute to Kolkata for work and a few are engaged in small personal businesses within the locality. A significant number of people have also moved out of Bhatpara. (see the Demographics section for the rather dramatic tell-tale data).\n\n\nThere are a number of jute mills in the Bhatpara area (Jagatdal, Kankinara and Shyamnagar) listed by the Jute Commissioner: Alliance Mills, Anglo-India Jute and Textile Industries, Auckland Jute Mill, Jagatdal Jute & Industries, Reliance Jute Mills, Shree Gourishankar Jute Mill and Waverly Jute Mill. These mills are not declared as closed but they do not seem to be in operation. Information about these mills is not readily available.\n\nBhatpara Municipality is included in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area for which the KMDA is the statutory planning and development authority.\n\nState Highway 1 (locally known as Ghoshpara Road) passes through Bhatpara. Public transport includes auto rickshaws running between Naihati and Bhatpara, cycle rickshaws and bus service (routes 85, 87A etc).\n\nBhatpara is served by three railway stations on the Sealdah-Ranaghat line. Shyamnagar railway station is 30.2 km from Sealdah railway station, Jagaddal railway station is 33.2 km and Kankinara railway station is 35.1 km. The railway links are part of the Kolkata Suburban Railway system. It is approximately a one-hour train journey from Kolkata to Bhatpara.\n\nIt also has boat services to the other bank of Hooghly river, connecting it to Chinsura and Chandannagar.\n\nAround a total of 32 lakh people from all around the city commute to Kolkata daily for work. In the Sealdah-Krishnanagar section there are 34 trains that carry commuters from 30 railway stations. In the Seadah-Shantipur section 32 trains carry commuters from 29 stations.\n\nEarlier, Bhatpara was renowned for its Sanskrit erudition. As for example, Srijib Nayatirtha (1893–1992) was a famous Sanskrit scholar and recipient of several fellowships and awards (including President's Honor). He was a Professor of Calcutta and Jadavpur Universities. Much of that ancient tradition has faded. However, modern educational practices are upheld by several high schools such as \"Kendriya Vidyalaya Kankinara\", \"Kankinara Arya Vidyalaya\", \"Bhatpara Amar Krishna Pathsala\", Bhatpara High School, Bhatpara Central Girls' School, \"Taraknath Balika Bidyamandir\", Himayat-ul-Gurba High school, Chasm-i-Rahamat High School, Kankinara High School, Katadanga North Janata Arya Vidyalaya, Rajlaxmi Balika Vidyalaya.\n\nAccording to the official website of Barrackpore sub-division, there are 34 higher-secondary, 10 secondary and 135 primary schools within the jurisdiction of Bhatpara Municipality (although not all of them are situated in the main town).\n\nAlthough Bhatpara does not have any college within its territorial boundary, colleges in nearby Naihati and Barrackpore provide access to higher education for the youth of Bhatpara, Shyamnagar, Kankinara and Jagatdal. Many students go to Kolkata for university and technical education. Some also go to Kalyani because of there being an ITI college for technical education.\n\nThere are few play-fields in Bhatpara such as Barwari math, Sabuj Sangha math, Shatadal Math, A.K. Pathshala play ground, etc. Bhatpara Young Men's Association (BYMA) and Kishore Bahini are few organisations which promote sports and recreational activities such as cricket, football, gymnastics, bodybuilding (Bhatpara Bayam Samiti, Salpasoy Club, Olympus, Shatadal Bayam Samiti Club), etc.\n\nHistorically Bhatpara is famous as the abode of prominent Sanskrit pundits and as a seat of learning of ancient Hindu shastra and Vedic texts. That aspect of culture has diminished over time and has been replaced by more diverse modern-day culture. Bhatpara is famous for its Durgapuja. Although family-based pujas were more common a few decades ago, it has become a community-centric affair in modern times. The youth communities or clubs (Amra Kojon type) organise these pujas and due to the sheer number of these clubs, one can find over fifty pujas being arranged within a square kilometre of area. Under Bhatpara Municipality Kankinara is famous for Ganesh Chaturthi and Chatth puja. It is famous for traditional cloths like Punjabi, Sherwani, indo-western dress, and Priti Punjabi Museum is a famous shop for a collection of these traditional cloths in Bhatpara and Kankinara.\n\nSahitya Mandir is a West Bengal Government registered and state-funded public library well equipped with a large number of books and periodicals.\n\nOne of the oldest ghats, it belongs to the Mukherjee family. Since almost 100 years back Radhakanta Mukherjee built the ghat in 1908 and dedicated it to his father Late Rupdas Mukherjee on the bank of River Ganga. Apart from that there is a Ganga-nasi Ghar (for Antorjali Jatra), Rupeswar Shiv Mandir. The family carries on with their traditional Ratha Jatra which was started in the year of 1912.\n\nIt is one of the oldest zamindari houses of Bhatpara where an age-old Durga Puja is celebrated.\n\nIt is a ghat beside Ganges.\n\nJust 200 metres from Kankinara Bazar towards the Kankinara Ghat The Panch Mukhi Hanuman mandir is there and it is one of the best temples in Bhatpara.\nThe evening Arti of lord Hanuman is also famous.\n\nIt is a temple in this locality, beside the Ganga river and the ghat named Balaram Sarkar Ghat.\n\nIt is a complex of five temples constructed nearly 400 years ago. Each of the temples were funded by different well-established families of the upper class. Some portions of these temples were decorated with terracotta art.\n\n\"Aat Goli\"(আট গলি= Eight Alleys/Lanes) is an amalgamation of eight different back-alleys connected during municipal renovations. It is famous for being extremely narrow and having eight near-exact 90 degree turns, meandering between 2-storied buildings like a narrow stream through mountains. It connects the \"Shetala Mandir\" to the Barowari Math.\n\nIt is one of the best temple of Kankinara to visit. The Idol of god is in lying position, situated at 10 feet below the surface. This temple is located 2.5 km from Kankinara railway station. Along with this a Shiva temple is also situated nearby to it. Vaishnav, Kali, and Vishwakarma temples are also situated nearby to this temple. These temples are required to be renovated.\n\nThe holy place of the local Muslims in Kankinara. 5 waqt namaz regularly held here. Mostly people from Kankinara market area use this masjid fod prayer. The artwork of the mosque is outstanding.good\n\nOld mosque of the arya samaj area. Mostly managed by the local youths. People from the jute mill and local ghettoes use this mosque to worship the god. \n\n100 years old and the biggest mosque of the Kankinara area. More than a thousand people can actually pray in the mosque. It is very clean, and the architecture is historic and very much charismatic. On the occasion of Maharam or Eid, it is flooded by the people from the area.\n\nBhatpara State General Hospital functions with 119 beds and Bhatpara Matri Mangal Pratisthan has 15 beds. Kakinara has a primary health centre with 6 beds.\n\n"}

The majority of the St. Croix Band are divided into two groups: the federally recognized St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, who are one of four constituent members forming the federally recognized Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. The latter is one of six bands in the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.\n\nThe \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" were one of the three major Bands forming the \"Biitan-akiing-enabijig\" (Border Sitters), named because of their proximity to the Eastern Dakota peoples. In turn, the \"Biitan-akiing-enabijig\" were a sub-Nation of the \"Gichigamiwininiwag\" (Lake Superior Men).\n\nThe St. Croix Band arrived in the area nearly 600 years ago; according to their oral tradition, they were directed to move southward from Lake Superior to \"the place where there is food upon the waters.\" In colonizing the St. Croix River valley and its tributaries, the St. Croix Band entered into a fierce territorial dispute with the Eastern Dakota and the Fox. Eight other Native American Tribes were also located in the St. Croix River Valley.\n\nTo this day in the Ojibwe language, the headwaters of the St. Croix River is called \"Manoominikeshiinyag-ziibi\" (Ricing Rail River), the St. Croix River below the confluence of the Namekegon River as \"Gichi-ziibi\" (Big River) and below the confluence of Trade River as \"Jiibayaatigo-ziibi\" (Grave-marker River). The name \"St. Croix River\" was based on the \"Jiibayaatigo-ziibi\" name of the river.\n\nSt. Croix Band was originally divided into the following sub-bands:\n\nDue to the inter-relationship and marriages with the Eastern Dakota peoples, the Knife, Rice, Rush, Snake, Sunrise and Apple River bands were considered equally Dakota as Ojibwe. Consequently, citizens from these Bands may have had Dakota names, many were of the Ma'iingan (Wolf) Doodem, and some Chiefs, such as Shak'pi, signed treaties both as Ojibwe and as Dakota.\n\nThe St. Croix Band are signatories to the Treaty of St. Peters (1837), also known as the \"White Pine Treat,\" which ceded lands so that lumbermen could harvest the great number of White pine growing along the St. Croix River watershed. This treaty assured the signatory Tribes of the right to continue to enjoy traditional hunting, fishing and gathering practices in the territory. After the Sandy Lake Tragedy in the autumn and winter of 1850, the St. Croix Band and other Ojibwe bands, with public support and outcry throughout the United States, were spared from the Indian removal policy.\n\nThe St. Croix and other bands entered treaty negotiations with the US to establish a reservation for each of the Ojibwe bands. Confident that the Tribe could maintain exercising their hunting, fishing and gathering rights in the area ceded to the United States in 1837, the St. Croix Band did not agree to relocating to a reservation. In 1854, the St. Croix Band were omitted from the Treaty of La Pointe and lost their federal recognition. No longer with recognized status, the St. Croix Band was prohibited from exercising its hunting rights that had been protected under the Treaty of St. Peters.\n\nThe US government urged the St. Croix Band members of Wisconsin to relocate to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation so that they could received annuity payments. Although many did relocate, just as many remained in the St. Croix valley. When the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation was established in 1855, the remaining St. Croix Band members in Minnesota were urged to relocate there; again, some did, but others stayed outside the reservation.\n\nWith tensions rising between the lumbermen and the St. Croix Band, the US removed several St. Croix Band villages to the Gull Lake Reservation near Brainerd, Minnesota. The Rice River Band of the St. Croix Band was absorbed by the Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa.\n\nDue to repeated broken promises by the United States, the Eastern Dakota peoples expressed their anger at the government. Failing to get an adequate response from their assigned Indian Agent, in 1862 the Dakota peoples declared war against the United States in what is now referred as the \"Dakota War of 1862,\" which occurred during the American Civil War. Many Ojibwe bands, including the St. Croix Band members relocated onto the Gull Lake Reservation and the St. Croix Band members living with the Rice Lake Band members awaiting for the establishment of an Indian Reservation, joined the Dakota people to support their efforts. The Dakota were defeated by the United States, who punished them and their allies. They removed the hostile bands to the vicinity surrounding the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, then to a more distant location, now known as the White Earth Indian Reservation. (Both of these bands became members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.)\n\nMeanwhile, as the portion of the St. Croix Band that remained in the St. Croix river valley were not based on any reservation, most received no allotments and little in the way of educational or health services from the US Federal government. People in northern Wisconsin began to refer to the St. Croix Band as \"the lost tribe\". Unlike neighboring Tribes existing on resources available on their respective Reservations, the St. Croix Band adapted to the rise of the logging industry by utilizing it as a source of wage labor. St. Croix Band members frequently worked as lumberjacks and river drivers.\n\nBy 1902, the Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa that had removed to the White Earth Indian Reservation returned to east-central Minnesota. They settled on the south side of Sandy Lake, just north of McGregor. A small group of Rice River Band of St. Croix Band who returned with them established the \"Minisinaakwaang\" Village at East Lake, located south of McGregor.\n\nIn 1934, under the Indian Reorganization Act, St. Croix Band in Wisconsin reorganized under a written constitution and regained federal recognition, as the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. The \"Minisinaakwaang\" Village, Lake Lena Village, Kettle River and Snake River communities of the St. Croix Band in Minnesota became part of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe when the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was established.\n\nToday, the St. Croix Band communities in Minnesota form the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III, located primarily in Pine County. The \"Minisinaakwaang\" Village serves as the government center for the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District II.\n\n\n"}

It is related to the gamma function, the K-function and the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant, and was named after mathematician Ernest William Barnes. It can be written in terms of the double gamma function.\n\nFormally, the Barnes \"G\"-function is defined in the following Weierstrass product form:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, exp(\"x\") = \"e\", and ∏ is capital pi notation.\n\nThe Barnes \"G\"-function satisfies the functional equation\n\nwith normalisation \"G\"(1) = 1. Note the similarity between the functional equation of the Barnes G-function and that of the Euler Gamma function:\n\nThe functional equation implies that \"G\" takes the following values at integer arguments:\n\nand thus\n\nwhere formula_8 denotes the gamma function and \"K\" denotes the K-function. The functional equation uniquely defines the G function if the convexity condition: formula_9 is added.\n\nThe difference equation for the G function, in conjunction with the functional equation for the gamma function, can be used to obtain the following reflection formula for the Barnes G function (originally proved by Hermann Kinkelin):\n\nThe logtangent integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated in terms of the Clausen function (of order 2), as is shown below:\n\nThe proof of this result hinges on the following evaluation of the cotangent integral: introducing the notation formula_12 for the logcotangent integral, and using the fact that formula_13, an integration by parts gives\n\nPerforming the integral substitution formula_15 gives\n\nThe Clausen function – of second order – has the integral representation\n\nHowever, within the interval formula_18, the absolute value sign within the integrand can be omitted, since within the range the 'half-sine' function in the integral is strictly positive, and strictly non-zero. Comparing this definition with the result above for the logtangent integral, the following relation clearly holds:\n\nThus, after a slight rearrangement of terms, the proof is complete:\n\nUsing the relation formula_21 and dividing the reflection formula by a factor of formula_22 gives the equivalent form:\n\nRef: see Adamchik below for an equivalent form of the reflection formula, but with a different proof.\n\nReplacing z with (1/2) − \"z\"\" in the previous reflection formula gives, after some simplification, the equivalent formula shown below (involving Bernoulli polynomials):\n\nBy Taylor's theorem, and considering the logarithmic derivatives of the Barnes function, the following series expansion can be obtained:\n\nIt is valid for formula_27. Here, formula_28 is the Riemann Zeta function:\n\nExponentiating both sides of the Taylor expansion gives:\n\nComparing this with the Weierstrass product form of the Barnes function gives the following relation:\n\nLike the Gamma function, the G-function also has a multiplication formula:\n\nwhere formula_33 is a constant given by:\n\nHere formula_35 is the derivative of the Riemann zeta function and formula_36 is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.\n\nThe logarithm of \"G\"(\"z\" + 1) has the following asymptotic expansion, as established by Barnes:\n\nHere the formula_38 are the Bernoulli numbers and formula_36 is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant. (Note that somewhat confusingly at the time of Barnes the Bernoulli number formula_40 would have been written as formula_41, but this convention is no longer current.) This expansion is valid for formula_42 in any sector not containing the negative real axis with formula_43 large.\n\nThe parametric Loggamma can be evaluated in terms of the Barnes G-function (Ref: this result is found in Adamchik below, but stated without proof):\n\nThe proof is somewhat indirect, and involves first considering the logarithmic difference of the Gamma function and Barnes G-function:\n\nwhere\n\nand formula_47 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.\n\nTaking the logarithm of the Weierstrass product forms of the Barnes function and Gamma function gives:\n\nA little simplification and re-ordering of terms gives the series expansion:\n\nFinally, take the logarithm of the Weierstrass product form of the Gamma function, and integrate over the interval formula_50 to obtain:\n\nEquating the two evaluations completes the proof:\n\nAnd since formula_21 then,\n\n"}

Most recently, he portrayed Lord Mountbatten in the third season of \"The Crown\".\n\nCharles Dance was born in Redditch, Worcestershire, the son of Eleanor Marion (\"née\" Perks, 1911–1984), a cook, and Walter Dance (1874–1949), an electrical engineer who had served as a sergeant in the 2nd Regular Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) during the Second Boer War in South Africa (having previously served in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion). Dance has an older half-brother, David (born 1936), from his father's previous marriage.\n\nWhen Dance was about three years old, his father died. He had always thought that his father had been in his early fifties when this happened, but later discovered that he was actually some 26 years older than he had believed. During filming of an episode for the genealogical series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" in 2016, Dance also discovered that through his maternal line, he is of partial Belgian ancestry, descended from a family whose roots lay in Spa. His immigrant ancestor Charles François Futvoye (1777–1847) had been a pioneer in the art of Japanning during the early half of the 19th century, and a resident of Marylebone in London.\n\nGrowing up in Plymouth, Devon, Dance attended Widey Technical School for Boys (it was closed in 1988, then known as Widey High School) in Crownhill. He later attended Plymouth College of Art and the Leicester College of Arts (now known as De Montfort University), where he studied graphic design and photography.\n\nDance was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company during the mid-to-late 1970s and was in many of their productions in London and Stratford-upon-Avon. Later he returned to the RSC to take the title role in \"Coriolanus\" at Stratford-upon-Avon and Newcastle in 1989, and at the Barbican Theatre in 1990. He received rave reviews and a Critics' Circle Best Actor award for his performance as C. S. Lewis in William Nicholson's \"Shadowlands\", in the 2007 stage revival.\n\nDance made his screen debut in 1974, in the ITV series \"Father Brown\" as Commandant Neil O'Brien in \"The Secret Garden\". Other small parts followed, including a 1983 cameo as a South African assassin in \"The Professionals\", but his big break came the following year when he played the major role of Guy Perron in \"The Jewel in the Crown\" (Granada Television, Christopher Morahan 1984), an adaptation of Paul Scott's novels that also made stars of Geraldine James and Art Malik. Dance made one of his earliest big-screen appearances in the 1981 James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\" as evil henchman Claus. Though he turned down the opportunity to screen test for the James Bond role, in 1989 he played Bond creator Ian Fleming in Anglia Television's dramatised biography directed by Don Boyd, \"Goldeneye\" (the name of Fleming's estate in Jamaica and a title later used for a James Bond film).\n\nHe has also starred in many other British television dramas such as \"Edward the Seventh\" (as dissolute Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, Edward VII's oldest son, and heir to the throne), \"\", \"Randall and Hopkirk\", \"Rebecca\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"Fingersmith\" and \"Bleak House\" (for which he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie). He was name-checked in the British comedy series \"Absolutely Fabulous\", as being slated to play the title character in \"The Life of Jesus Christ 2\", which was filming in Morocco at the same time as the main characters of the series were there for a photo shoot. He also played Guy Spencer, the pro-Hitler propagandist, in the second instalment of \"Foyle's War\", and had an ongoing role as Dr. Maltravers in the ITV drama \"Trinity\".\n\nDance made a guest appearance on the BBC drama series \"Merlin\" as the Witchfinder Aredian, and as a vainglorious version of himself in the third series of \"Jam & Jerusalem\". He played Lord Vetinari in the 2010 Sky adaptation of \"Terry Pratchett's Going Postal\", and as the Russian oligarch Aleksandr Borinski in \"Paris Connections\".

Like BitTorrent, Avalanche splits the file to be distributed into small blocks. However, rather than peers simply transmitting the blocks, they transmit random linear combinations of the blocks along with the random coefficients of this linear combination - a technique known as 'network coding'. This technique removes the need for each peer to have complex knowledge of block distribution across the network (an aspect of BitTorrent-like protocols which the paper claims does not scale very well).\n\nBram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, criticized the proposed Avalanche system in a post to his blog. He mentions inaccuracies in the paper's analysis of the BitTorrent protocol (some of it being based on a 4-years-out-of-date version of the protocol which used an algorithm that \"sucks\") and describes the paper as \"garbage.\"\n\n"}

Girl are still cited as an influence by many major artists twenty years later, even though they disbanded after only three years, allegedly due to their record company and mismanagement. In total Gerry Laffy has released 30 albums; he has played in venues as diverse as Wembley Arena, Taipei Hard Rock Cafe, the Reading Festival.\n\nIn 1978, Laffy was a founding member of the band Girl (along with Philip Lewis). Girl were first discovered by promoter Jon Lindsay, a partner of the former manager of The Who, Kit Lambert. Lambert and Lindsay were seeking out bands to sign to Lambert's new record company during the fledgling Nu Romantics era. The band were first introduced to music publisher Simon Napier-Bell of Nomis but eventually signed a recording deal with Jet Records. The band became famous after their now infamous three-night residency at the former Marquee Club in Wardour St. and recorded three albums and put out two (\"Sheer Greed\" and \"Wasted Youth\") between 1980 and 1983. \"Killing Time\" was finally released in 1998, and two live albums and an anthology were released later. After Girl disintegrated, Laffy joined London Cowboys, (with former members of The Idols, Sex Pistols and New York Dolls), which released two albums in 1985. He then played guitar on demos of Duran Duran's 1986 \"Notorious\" album. In 1990, Laffy founded Die Laughing Records and released the solo album \"Money & the Magic\". The song \"Shoot 'Em Down\" from this album was included on the European soundtrack to the film \"\". Laffy formed Sheer Greed with some of Girl's alumni, which put out two albums in 1992 and 1993. He followed up with a joint Gerry Laffy/Simon Laffy album called \"Lying With Angels\", then a guest appearance on the 1994 album \"Revelation\" from Ultravox. From mid-1997 to mid-2000, Laffy was lead guitarist in Terroristen, John Taylor's band while on hiatus from Duran Duran. Terroristen recorded constantly and gigged all over the United States and Japan, also travelling to Taiwan and Germany. In 2001, he released a second solo album \"All Day Long\". In 2005, Gerry was a guest vocalist with ex-Freddie Mercury guitarist Chris Chesney on his album \"Diabolical Liberties\". In 2007, a third solo album - \"The Icebox Studio Sessions\" was released. Self performed, written and produced. In July 2009 Girl were approached to reform for a 30th Anniversary tour of Japan & UK in 2010. It is yet to be confirmed. 2013 saw Gerry Laffy solo albums No.4. Entitled 'Just A Little Blurred'and 'Wrecked But Not Crushed' BOTH self performed, written and produced. 'Just A Little Blurred' features an update of the Girl classic 'My Number' with guest Craig Bundy on bass.\n\nFor fifteen years, from 1982 to 1997, Laffy worked as personal manager for film director Russell Mulcahy. They formed the company LeBad Films together. Laffy also served as Mulcahy's personal assistant on his first three features \"Razorback\", \"Highlander\", and Duran Duran's \"Arena\". He managed Mulcahy through the pinnacle of his career, including ten feature films and dozens of award-winning music videos (including Duran Duran, Queen, The Rolling Stones, Billy Joel, Elton John and Fleetwood Mac) and commercials (including the Ford Motor Company, Smirnoff, Opel, British Petroleum, Universal Studios, and Miller Brewing). In 1995, he established his own film production company Laffy Michaels Filmworks, which set up the John Carpenter's $20 million film \"Vampires\", starring James Woods.\n\nBefore his first band, Laffy started his career as a graphic artist at London Weekend Television.

He has written about the Kennedys, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Donald Trump.\n\nBorn in Yonkers, New York, Klein attended Colgate University, graduated from Columbia University School of General Studies, and received an MS degree from the Columbia University School of Journalism.\n\nKlein is the former foreign editor of \"Newsweek\" and served as the editor-in-chief of \"The New York Times Magazine\" from 1977 to 1987. He frequently contributes to \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Parade\" and writes a weekly celebrity gossip column in \"Parade\" called \"Personality Parade\" under the pseudonym \"Walter Scott.\" (The Walter Scott pseudonym had originally been used by Lloyd Shearer, who wrote the column from 1958 to 1991.) He also writes books, many of which have been on the New York Times Bestseller list. Additionally, he was the principal for the Business Communications School at The Euclid High School Complex. He was photographed by popular Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton, on June 12, 2014, which led to his personal website crashing due to a high volume of visitors. Klein is also a contributor for the \"New York Post\".\n\nKlein is the father of two grown children, Karen (former manager of The Four Seasons restaurant in New York City), and Alec (a professor at \"Northwestern University\"). He has been divorced twice. He was married to Dolores J. Barrett, senior vice president for Worldwide Public Relations at Polo Ralph Lauren, who died on 24 December 2013 in Manhattan. Klein is the stepfather-in-law of Ruth Shalit.\n\nKlein received extensive criticism for his 2005 biography of Hillary Clinton, \"The Truth About Hillary\". \"Politico\" criticized the book for \"serious factual errors, truncated and distorted quotes and overall themes [that] don't gibe with any other serious accounts of Clinton's life.\" The conservative columnist John Podhoretz criticized the book in the \"New York Post\", \"Thirty pages into it, I wanted to take a shower. Sixty pages into it, I wanted to be decontaminated. And 200 pages into it, I wanted someone to drive stakes through my eyes so I wouldn't have to suffer through another word.\" In the \"National Review\", conservative columnist James Geraghty wrote, \"Folks, there are plenty of arguments against Hillary Clinton, her policies, her views, her proposals, and her philosophies. This stuff ain't it.

Facing criticism from both the left and right for making the claim, Klein eventually backed away from the insinuation in an interview with radio host Jim Bohannon on June 23, 2005.\n\nThe British newspaper \"The Guardian\" pointed out a number of verifiable factual errors in Klein's 2014 book \"Blood Feud\".\n\nKlein has also come under fire for his use of anonymous quotes, purported to be from the subjects of his books, which he claims he received from anonymous insiders. The credibility of such quotes has been questioned by writers such as Joe Conason, Salon's Simon Maloy and conservative commentators Rush Limbaugh and Peggy Noonan. \"Some of the quotes strike me as odd, in the sense that I don't know people who speak this way,\" Limbaugh said of Klein's work, describing the sources as \"grade school chatter.\"\n\n\n"}

The original UK release by Mute Records consisted of four original, self-produced tracks. In the UK, where at the time EPs were eligible for the singles chart, it became one of Erasure's most successful releases, matching the number two peak of 1986's \"Sometimes\". It was promoted with a simple music video for the lead track \"Stop!\", showing Clarke and Bell performing the song on a stage surrounded by \"stop\", \"no entry\", \"give way\" and similar road signs.\n\nIn the U.S., \"Crackers International\" was still considered an EP, although two remixes were added (bringing the track list count to six) when Sire Records released it. In the U.S., where EPs chart on the \"Billboard\" 200, it hit number seventy-three.

As a wrestler he is best known for his appearances in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2004 to 2005, where he portrayed an Arab American under the ring name Muhammad Hassan. His career came to an abrupt end when a controversial terrorist angle coincided with the 7 July 2005 London bombings, leading the television network UPN to pressure WWE to remove Copani's character from television. Following leaving WWE, he stopped wrestling, instead working as an educator. Copani returned to wrestling in 2018 at The Dynasty event King of Thrones. He is currently the principal of Fulton Junior High School in \nFulton, New York.\n\nCopani was born in Syracuse, New York to a family of Italian descent. He graduated from Cicero – North Syracuse High School in 1998. He enrolled in the State University of New York at Buffalo, studying for a degree in history. In 2002, he left university to pursue a career in professional wrestling.\n\nCopani joined the Louisville, Kentucky-based promotion Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in 2002. He debuted in the same year under the ring name Mark Magnus.\n\nOn August 13, 2003, Copani defeated Johnny Jeter to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship. The title was vacated on December 10, 2003 when Copani was pinned by both Jeter and Nick Dinsmore in a triple threat match.\n\nIn 2004, the promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) approached OVW seeking a wrestler to portray an Arab American character. Despite being ethnically \"100 per cent Italian\", Copani was offered the opportunity by OVW booker Jim Cornette.\n\nCopani made his WWE television debut on \"Raw\" as Muhammad Hassan on December 13, 2004 in an in-ring segment with Mick Foley after wrestling dark matches and house shows for about two months. His introductory video and gimmick featured him and his manager, Iranian-American Khosrow Daivari, introducing themselves. He described himself as an Arab-American wrestler wanting relief from the increased prejudice and stereotypes created by the 9/11 attacks, as he enters professional wrestling. He then concluded with a controversial extension of hands and praise to Allah. He stopped praising Allah vocally due to complaints by Muslim-Americans, but still extended his hands during his ring entrance. His speech followed by a Persian translation of his speech by Daivari. Hassan's gimmick also involved him interrupting promos by other wrestlers with his theme music and approaching the ring to cut promos of his own, typically complaining about being held back due to anti-Arab prejudice.\n\nMaking his entrance into the WWE, he berated the way the media have characterized Arab-Americans after September 11. As an example, he focused his anger on Raw announcers Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and Jim Ross. He and Daivari faced the two announcers in an in-ring debate on the January 3, 2005 episode of \"Raw\". He then defeated Lawler in his debut match at the New Year's Revolution pay-per-view event. In the course of his undefeated streak, Hassan defeated wrestlers such as The Hurricane, Sgt. Slaughter, Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. Hassan had attracted much heat as a villain, a fact which was evident at the Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match itself. When Hassan entered at number 13, everyone who was in the ring at the time (Booker T, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Eddie Guerrero, Luther Reigns, Rey Mysterio and Shelton Benjamin) immediately ganged up on Hassan and eliminated him. Notably, Edge and Reigns were also villains at the time.\n\nAt WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Hassan and Daivari were featured in a segment with Hulk Hogan that saw Hogan coming to the rescue of wrestler Eugene, who was being attacked by the two Middle Eastern performers. The next night on \"Raw\", Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week on \"Raw\", Michaels approached Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but he did tell Michaels to find a partner and he would grant a match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan to come back and team with him. On the April 18 episode of \"Raw\", Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer.\n\nAt Backlash on May 1, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels, with Daivari being pinned. Hassan would blame and attack Daivari for the loss the next night on \"Raw\". On the May 30 episode of \"Raw\", Hassan faced then World Heavyweight Champion Batista and won by disqualification. However, he and Daivari were beaten by Batista after the match. The next week on \"Raw\", Hassan was granted a two-on-one handicap match with Daivari for the Intercontinental Championship against Shelton Benjamin after threatening \"Raw\" General Manager Eric Bischoff with a lawsuit for Batista's actions. After Hassan initially appeared to pin Benjamin and won the title, the referee realized Benjamin was on the ropes and reversed his decision. Benjamin eventually pinned Daivari to retain the Intercontinental Championship. On the June 13 episode of \"Raw\", Stone Cold Steve Austin appeared as a special guest enforcer on the request of Bischoff to listen to Hassan's complaints. After listening to Hassan's problems, Austin agreed with him and ordered a match between Hassan and Benjamin for the Intercontinental Championship that night, stating that Hassan was \"screwed by the system\". As Hassan was about to win the match with the help of Daivari, Austin entered the ring and delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to both Hassan and Daivari, making Hassan the winner by disqualification and allowing Benjamin to retain the title as it can not change hands by a disqualification.\n\nOn the June 20 episode of \"Raw\", Hassan and Daivari interrupted a promo by then WWE Champion John Cena to complain about how Hassan was \"screwed\" out of the Intercontinental Championship. Bischoff took the opportunity to punish Cena by booking him against Hassan in a WWE Championship match, in which Hassan's losing streak in title matches continued as Cena dominated him in a two-minute squash match, pinning him cleanly and thus ending his \"unpinned\" streak.\n\nOn the June 23 episode of \"SmackDown!\", it was revealed both Hassan and Daivari were drafted to SmackDown in the 2005 draft lottery. Hassan won his first \"SmackDown!\" match by defeating Big Show with help from Big Show's rival Matt Morgan. The following week on June 30, Hassan was involved in a confrontation with The Undertaker.\n\nIn one of the most controversial moments in WWE history, on the episode of \"SmackDown!\" taped on July 4, 2005, the \"SmackDown!\" General Manager Theodore Long put Hassan in a match against The Undertaker at The Great American Bash and placed Daivari in a match that night against The Undertaker. Daivari was defeated, but Hassan began to \"pray\" on the ramp, summoning five masked men, dressed in black shirts, ski-masks, and camo pants. Armed with clubs and a piano wire, they beat and choked The Undertaker out, and Hassan put him in the camel clutch. Afterward, the masked men lifted Daivari above their heads and carried him away. Three days later, the London bombings took place. The footage aired unedited on UPN in the United States and on The Score in Canada with an advisory warning shown several times during the broadcast. It was removed from the Australian and European (including in the United Kingdom) broadcasts.\n\nThe angle elicited national attention in the \"New York Post\", \"TV Guide\", \"Variety\", and other major media outlets. In response to the criticism, UPN decided that it would monitor the storyline closely and that it did not want the Hassan character on its network that week. Hassan later delivered a promo to the live crowd for the July 14, 2005 airing episode of \"SmackDown!\", but when UPN announced that the segment would be edited, WWE decided to host the video of the segment on its official website. In the segment, Hassan reiterates that he is an Arab-American and that the American people automatically and unfairly assume that he is a terrorist. Despite being in character, he referred to the real-world media coverage of the storyline, singling out the \"New York Post's\" Don Kaplan by name, and denouncing his description of the events on \"SmackDown!\", such as Kaplan's comment of the masked men being \"Arabs in ski masks\". On the July 14, 2005 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Hassan's absence was explained by a statement delivered by his lawyer Thomas Whitney, which said that Hassan refused to appear at The Great American Bash due to the way he had been treated by the media and WWE fans.\n\nIt was revealed in late July 2005 that UPN had pressured WWE to keep Hassan off of their network, effectively deleting him from \"SmackDown!\". Hassan lost the match to The Undertaker at The Great American Bash on July 24, 2005, and was written off with The Undertaker doing a \"Last Ride\" through an open stage ramp onto a concrete floor where it was reported that he sustained serious injuries and had to be rushed to a nearby medical facility, apparently a solution aimed to end the Hassan character. Several days later, WWE.com hosted a video of a kayfabe announcement from Theodore Long, where he reiterates the stipulation that Hassan would no longer appear on \"SmackDown!\". Due to increasing public pressure, WWE was forced to later drop the character altogether, sending Copani and Daivari back to their developmental territories to alter their gimmicks. This resulted in huge fan backlash, mostly because Hassan was at the height of his notoriety. Copani was released from his WWE contract on September 21, 2005 and announced his retirement from professional wrestling. In subsequent years, it was revealed that Hassan had been planned to receive a major push, eventually winning the World Heavyweight Championship from Batista on August 21, 2005 at SummerSlam which would have made him the youngest world champion in WWE history, breaking Randy Orton's record.\n\nOn April 28, 2018, Hassan returned to professional wrestling for the first time in thirteen years, appearing at The Dynasty event Dynasty King of Thrones, defeating Papadon. Hassan defeated Bin Hamin for the Dynasty Heavyweight Championship on June 6, but then immediately vacated the belt, due to inability to make shows consistently, out of respect to the fans and the company. He returned to the promotion on September 29, defeating Sean Carr. In 2019 he would state in an interview that he would never wrestle again due to his other career as a principal.\n\nAfter leaving WWE, Copani went back to college and became an educator. He became a world history teacher at Hannibal High School in Hannibal, New York before becoming assistant principal at Fulton High School and is currently the principal of Fulton Junior High School.\n\nIn July 2016, Copani was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Copani's graphic novel he wrote with Shad Gaspard of Cryme Tyme, \"Assassin & Son\", won several awards for best original independent graphic novel. Gaspard came up with the original concept/premise and wrote the screenplay along with Copani. The series is said to be a modern version of Kazuo Koike's \"Lone Wolf and Cub\".\n\nHassan appears as a playable character in the video games \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\" and \"WWE Day of Reckoning 2\".\n\n"}

The doctrine is subject to a number of exceptions, including that the plaintiff must be an active, voluntary participant in the wrongful conduct, the plaintiff's wrongdoing must be at least substantially equal to that of the defendant, the \"adverse interest\" exception, and the \"innocent insider\" exception.\n\nThe phrase is most commonly used by courts when relief is being denied to both parties in a civil action because of equal wrongdoing by both parties. The phrase means, in essence, that if both parties are equally at fault, the court will not involve itself in resolving one side's claim over the other, and whoever possesses whatever is in dispute may continue to do so in the absence of a superior claim. It is an equitable defense. \n\nThe doctrines of comparative fault (a doctrine of tort law that compares the fault of each party in a lawsuit for a single injury) and contributory negligence (applicable when plaintiffs/claimants have, through their own negligence, contributed to the harm they suffered) are not the same as \"in pari delicto\", though all of these doctrines have related policy rationale underpinnings.\n\nJudge George B. Daniels of the Southern District of New York held in 2010 in \"SEC v. Lee\", 720 F. Supp. 2d 305, that: \"To successfully apply the doctrine, the plaintiff must be an active, voluntary participant in the wrongful conduct, and the plaintiff's wrongdoing must be at least substantially equal to that of the defendant... Furthermore, under New York law, the doctrine of in pari delicto may be subject to the \"adverse interest\" exception, which applies when an agent is defrauding the principal exclusively for the agent's own benefit and to the detriment of the corporation... Another exception to the in pari delicto defense is the \"innocent insider\" exception, which provides that if there is another agent within the corporation who had no knowledge of the fraud, and who had the will and the ability to stop the fraud had it come to his or her attention, the in pari delicto defense will fail...\"\n\n"}

The privately held company was founded in Nova Scotia in 1969 by the Bragg family, and has grown since through the amalgamation of several telecommunications companies.\n\nThe company began in Amherst, Nova Scotia, in 1969, where it was later issued one of the first cable licences granted by the CRTC. It acquired Halifax Cablevision Ltd., at the time the largest system in Eastern Canada, in 1985. Through a series of acquisitions, which included the purchase of Amtelecom, Persona, Bluewater, Delta and Coast Cable, Eastlink became the fifth-largest cable television provider in Canada by 2010, with approximately 1,500 employees working in offices across the country. As of 2010, it was the largest privately owned cable company in Canada, with 457,075 subscribers in nine provinces (excluding Saskatchewan). It remains privately held by the Bragg family of Oxford, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn 2008, Eastlink purchased the wireline business of ISN, Prince Edward Island's only local internet service provider. As of 2020, ISN re-entered the wireline business with a home and business fibre service.\n\nIn 2015, Eastlink came under fire for introducing data caps of 15 GB/month for broadband customers. Critics argued that the amount of data was considered unusually low for residential internet.\n\nIn 2017, Eastlink decided to revoke the email address of a customer who had been using it since 1998 because they concluded it was misleading and could be confused with an Eastlink service. Eastlink gave the customer 30 days notice to \"go through 20 years worth of email\".\n\nEastlink delivers digital video/television and cable-network-based Internet services with speeds up to 940 megabits per second, one of the faster networks of this kind in North America. It was one of the first companies in North America to bundle digital cable and broadband Internet services with home phone service.\n\nEastlink's 100 and 940 megabit service has unlimited usage. Its mid-tier 150 and 300 megabit services have usage based billing except if you get a bundle.\n\nEastlink also produces community channels branded as Eastlink TV to serve the company's cable customers.\n\nEastlink offers video on demand, digital video recorders and high definition television (HDTV) services in many communities across Canada.\n\nEastlink spent $25 million during the 2008 Advanced Wireless Services auction for 19 licenses in Ontario and Atlantic Canada as well as Grande Prairie, Alberta. The company announced in 2011 that it would introduce wireless services, beginning with announced for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In February 2013, Eastlink launched its wireless service with HSPA+ and LTE services being available at the launch date.\n\nAs Eastlink deployed many wireless repeater towers for its Motorola Canopy service launched as part of the Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative, upgrading these to serve as a cell and Wi-Fi mesh network was an obvious potential that would attract third parties with no tower access, such as Wind, to partner with Eastlink.\n\nIn May 2016, Eastlink announced that it would launch wireless service in the cities of Timmins and Sudbury in northern Ontario. Eastlink activated its LTE network, including Voice over LTE, in Timmins on June 1, 2016 with the LTE network in Sudbury activated on June 9, 2016.\n\nEastlink was the first major Canadian cable company to offer competitive local telephone service in its territory in 1999 over a fibre optic network. In 2005 the area code 902 telephone market was the most competitive telephone exchange in North America and this was credited to Eastlink's presence in the market. Eastlink was also the first provider to deliver local telephone competition to its service area in New Brunswick in 2005.\n\nIn 2010, Eastlink launched another service in cooperation with other providers and the government of Nova Scotia's Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative: a Motorola Canopy-based rural Internet service capable of 0.5 megabit uploads, 1.5 megabit downloads, which was intended to reach \"100% of civic addresses\" in Nova Scotia. This level of coverage is unique in North America and is a particular challenge in a province prone to extreme weather, fog, and winds. Eastlink claimed at public forums in early 2010 that the service would operate at under 100ms latency and accordingly be useful for VoIP from arbitrary third parties such as Skype, but this has not been verified. However, latency to the towers themselves was reliably under 2ms at that time.\n\nCritics of the Canopy service, notably Bell, argued that it is expensive (due to shorter range repeater towers). The strategy was poorly coordinated with cable networks (there being for instance no subsidy to extend the cable network where it would be easy to do so or even where it would facilitate the wireless services). Most open-systems-minded users considered Canopy an impractical direction compared to expansion of Wi-Fi hotspot services. Its primary competitor, Aliant, by contrast has invested in Wi-Fi, GSM and DSL services, but they remained as of 2011 expensive or unavailable in rural Nova Scotia.\nSome jurisdictions that report unsatisfactory results with all of these technologies, including Canopy, such as Door County, Wisconsin's Washington Island, have reported positive results with powerline networking. However, as power-lines do not reach \"100% of civic addresses\" they do not address quite the same issues. The deployment of powerline-based meters by Emera subsidiary Bangor Hydro, which also owns Nova Scotia Power Inc. on the board of which Eastlink CEO Lee Bragg serves, suggests that this technology may ultimately become part of the Eastlink mix in some rural areas.\n\nAs of early 2011, Rogers, Aliant, and Telus' mobile Internet offerings are extraordinarily expensive for heavy users and tethering of personal computers is not necessarily included under these plans; the price per gigabyte of the Eastlink service is clearly superior to any of these offerings. However, the maximum speed is much less (1.5Mbit/s download versus up to 21Mbit/s) and more so when these cellular providers upgrade to dual-carrier (42Mbit/s) HSPA+. For those more concerned with speed and less with price, cellular options will be a superior rural networking choice; for those concerned with price, Eastlink's fixed wireless service, the expansion of Wi-Fi hotspots, and the use of 802.11u and 802.21 will continue to form a more reliable mesh especially in attracting tourists or in densely populated areas.\n\nIn terms of speed, where it could reach groups of customers inaccessible by Canopy, Eastlink's wired network would be substantially faster, operating at up to 100Mbit/s download, compared to 1.5Mbit/s download. Fixed-wireless internet is, however, many times faster than dial-up (1.5Mbit/s) and does (unlike satellite) satisfy most expectations of \"broadband Internet access\". Broadband is economically or subjectively defined and is perceived very differently by persons with different latency expectations and service usage patterns, therefore perceptions of its quality are also subjective; Persons accustomed to dialup service may be thrilled with Canopy performance, whereas those used to wired cable find it slow or flaky.\n\nCanopy service deployment encountered numerous challenges in practice, including installation of unforeseen wireless relay towers installed on an \"ad hoc\" basis that increase latency, reduce service reliability and load other towers – the inherent problems of a mesh network.\n\nEastlink was not, as of November 2011, effectively held to its contractual obligation to provide \"100% of civic addresses\" with service nor its latency promises, even where most such customers could be easily accommodated by extending its wired network to these existing wireless relay towers. In particular, users on islands with water access were denied service as of summer 2011.\n\nInstallers as of November 2011 had no way to test latency before asking for customer sign-off and final installation, meaning that any user whose latency needs could not be met would not know that until after they had agreed the service was adequate, based only on raw signal strength.\n\nAs of late 2011, the project had still not yet reached its promise of \"100% of civic addresses.\" Eastlink has not commented on the consistency of speeds or latency on this network nor released any public Quality of Service (QoS) statistics or actual usage information about the services its users actually use. It was widely anticipated that Eastlink would offer access to its new cell network in 2012 on favourable terms to cut-off rural users.\n\nProvinces which currently have some Eastlink service are: Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick (limited to southern regions), Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia. It also serves the town of Point Roberts, Washington, in the United States, a geographic exclave of Washington which is accessible by land only from British Columbia.\n\nService in Saskatchewan was available in the past but is currently not available to new customers.\n\nAlthough the company has mostly unified its acquisitions under the Eastlink brand, in parts of British Columbia, Eastlink operates as Coast Cable in the Sunshine Coast and as Delta Cable in Delta, British Columbia and Point Roberts, Washington. Based on the redirection of users to Eastlink's website for both Coast Cable and Delta Cable, these brands are being phased out to unify these divisions under Eastlink.\n\nAs of February 2011, Eastlink has acquired service territory on the island of Bermuda.\n\nCellular service is currently available to residents of Nova Scotia; Prince Edward Island; south New Brunswick; Saint John, Fredericton, Moncton, Sussex, Sackville; St. John's, NL; Ontario; Greater Sudbury, ON; and Timmins, ON.\n"}

It was written by the group's creator Frank Farian, along with George Reyam and Fred Jay. It is a semi-biographical song about Grigori Rasputin, a friend and advisor of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family during the early 20th century. The song describes Rasputin as a playboy, mystical healer, and political manipulator.\n\n\"Rasputin\" references the hope held by Tsaritsa Alexandra Fyodorovna that Grigori Rasputin would heal her hemophiliac son, Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. It also claims that Rasputin was Alexandra's paramour: \"Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen, there was a cat that really was gone\", \"Russia's greatest love machine\", \"to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear\". The song claims that Rasputin's political power overshadowed that of the Tsar himself in \"all affairs of state\". When his sexual and political acts became intolerable, \"men of higher standing\" plotted his downfall, although \"the ladies begged\" them not to. Although the song states \"he was a brute\", it claims that the ladies \"just fell into his arms.\"\n\nThe end of the song recounts a modified version of a popular description of the events that culminated in Rasputin's assassination, as perpetrated by Felix Yusupov, Vladimir Purishkevich, and Dmitri Pavlovich, on 16 December 1916 (O.S.). The song claims that Rasputin's assassins fatally shot him after he survived the poisoning of his wine.\n\nWhile the song accurately re-tells many of the unfavorable rumors that damaged Rasputin's reputation, there is no verifiable evidence to suggest that he had an affair with Alexandra.\n\nAllMusic journalist Donald A. Guarisco described it as \"a tribute to the legendary Russian historical figure that uses balalaikas to create its textured rhythm guitar hook.\" Its melody has been compared to that of the traditional Turkish song \"Kâtibim\", but the band denied any similarity.\n\nThe song rose to the top of the charts in Germany and Austria and went to No. 2 in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. It was also another No. 1 hit for Boney M. in Australia, giving them their second (and last) chart-topper in that country (the other one being \"Rivers of Babylon\").\n\nAllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco called the track \"the oddest and most unusual and interesting combination of musical elements\" from \"Nightflight to Venus\", then picked it as one of his \"track picks\" from the album.\n\nAlthough the song was written and performed in English, with single German and Russian words – \"But the kasatschok he danced really Wunderbar!\" – it enjoyed great popularity in the Soviet Union, and is credited with reviving the fame of Rasputin there. The song was omitted, however, from the Soviet pressing of the album and Boney M. were barred from performing the song during their ten performances in Moscow in December 1978. During their visit to Poland in 1979, the band performed the song despite being asked not to by government officials. The show in Sopot was broadcast on national TV the next day after the song was edited out of their performance, but it was broadcast on the radio live and in full.\n\nThe song has been covered by several other bands in varying musical styles. Finnish band Turisas recorded a folk metal version, while Boiled in Lead covered it as a folk punk song. The British comic book \"Nikolai Dante\" cited a lyric from the song for the title of its story called \"Russia's Greatest Love Machine\" in the 1997 issue of \"2000 AD\". The Washington, D.C.-based dance/rock band Ra Ra Rasputin takes its name from the song. A Spanish version by Fangoria was included on their compilation album \"Dilemas, amores y dramas\" (2003). Russian metal cover project Even Blurry Videos released their version of the song on YouTube in August 2019.\n\nThe album pressings of \"Nightflight to Venus\" feature the title track segued into \"Rasputin\". Initial LP pressings included the full-length, 6:26 version of \"Rasputin\", most notable for an instrumental interlude in the third verse between the lines \"though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms\" and \"Then one night some men of higher standing ...\" that was later cut out. The second LP pressing featured a 6:03 version, subsequent pressings a 5:51 version. Boney M.'s single edit is completely different from the edit used for Frank Farian's Gilla recording in German that followed in November 1978 (without success).\n\nThe German and Benelux pressings were backed with \"Painter Man\"; for most other territories the B-side chosen was \"Never Change Lovers in the Middle of the Night\". The UK pressings had a 5:32 version; most countries faded it to 5:02, while the French Carrere Records release had a 4:45 version. In the United Kingdom, \"Painter Man\" was issued as an A-side single in February 1979, giving the group a No. 10 hit. In Canada, \"Rasputin\" was the A-side and became a major hit, topping the Canadian \"RPM\" magazine's Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks beginning 24 March 1979, and peaking at No. 7 on \"RPM\"'s Top 100 pop singles chart that same week. Despite the Canadian success, the song failed to chart in the United States.\n\nFinnish folk metal band Turisas recorded a cover of Rasputin, released on 21 September 2007 through Century Media. The band played the cover live for a few years and finally decided to record a studio version of it because of positive feedback from fans. A music video was shot as well.\n\nA limited edition 7\" picture vinyl features \"The Court of Jarisleif\" as the B-side.\n\nDifferent regions contained different B-Sides. Canadian, South American, Asian and some European releases featured \"Never Change Lovers In The Middle Of The Night,\" the US release featured \"He Was A Steppenwolf.\" The Polish and Chilean releases featured \"Night Flight To Venus\" and remaining European releases featured \"Painter Man\" at the B-Side.\n\n\n\n\"Rasputin\" inspired multiple songs and is featured in one or more films.\n\nJatin-Lalit sampled \"Rasputin\" for the song \"Sachi Ye Kahani Hai\" from \"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa\" (1994).\n\nIn the 2003 Malayalam film \"Balettan\", the song \"Baletta Baletta\" was inspired by \"Rasputin\". The song was composed by M. Jayachandran.\n\nIn the 2012 Indian film \"Agent Vinod\" there is a Hindi-language song titled \"I'll Do the Talking\"; the song is a partial interpolation of \"Rasputin\".\n\n"}

He is known for his ability to adapt to a variety of genres, and both his ambidextrous and his open-handed drumming styles. He plays the drums and sings backing vocals in the band. Beauford was ranked number 10 by a \"Rolling Stone\" magazine reader's poll in 2010 for greatest drummers of all-time.\n\nBeauford was first exposed to the drums at age three. At the time, his father had bought tickets to a Buddy Rich concert and could not find someone to watch his son, so he took young Beauford along to the show. Beauford was mesmerized by Buddy Rich on stage. After that show, Beauford's father bought his son a tin drum set with paper heads, since Beauford showed so much interest in learning the instrument. Beauford began performing professionally when he was nine.\n\nBeauford explains his unusual playing style in his instructional video \"Under The Table & Drumming\", attributing his use of left-hand-lead on a right-handed kit to playing his own kit in front of a mirror as a child in an attempt to emulate his favorite drummers, like Buddy Rich. He unknowingly set up his drums in reverse of whichever performer and set that he had in mind, in an attempt to make the mirrored image of himself match that of the audience's perspective, as he had seen it on stage and TV. This helped him to become completely ambidextrous at a very early age, albeit by accident.\n\nEventually, he joined Secrets, a Richmond-based jazz fusion band. Other members included childhood friend and next-door neighbor saxophonist LeRoi Moore, trumpeter John D'earth, vocalist Dawn Thompson, bassist Keith Horne, keyboardist Butch Taylor, keyboardist Dane Bryant, saxophonist Eddie Williams and virtuoso guitarist Tim Reynolds. Secrets performed throughout Virginia, at places such as The Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach, and at Miller's, the bar in Charlottesville where Dave Matthews worked as a bartender. Beauford also played jazz in Blue Indigo with LeRoi Moore, Sal Soghoian, and George Melvin. Blue Indigo performed regularly at Tokyo Rose and Miller's, and was featured at the Delaware Water Gap Jazz Festival. Eventually, Matthews approached both Beauford and Moore regarding some music he had written that he wished to record. Beauford agreed to perform on a demo, which is how he became involved with the group that was to become the Dave Matthews Band.\n\nBeauford has also worked with other artists on jam projects, including Vertical Horizon, Carlos Santana, Rashawn Ross, John Popper (of Blues Traveler), Tim Reynolds, Béla Fleck and Victor Wooten; both alone and within Béla Fleck and the Flecktones.\n\nBeauford uses a Yamaha Drums Recording Custom drum kit, a Ludwig Alex Van Halen Signature Rosewood snare drum, 6.5x14\" with a die-cast hoop on the batter side and a triple flanged hoop snare side, Zildjian cymbals, Remo drumheads, Vic Firth sticks and mallets, Yamaha and Drum Workshop hardware including a Yamaha Hex-Rack since the 2008 Summer Tour and various Latin Percussion cowbells, woodblocks and other assorted percussion equipment. He also uses FootJoy golf gloves rather than traditional drum gloves. Prior to Vic Firth, Beauford was an endorser of Pro-Mark sticks and even had his own Pro-Mark Carter Beauford signature drumstick.\n\nBeauford has used several Jeff Ocheltree, and Ron Dunnett custom metal snares in the past, the most common being a bright purple with gold hardware he used for the better half of the 2000s. Around the 2006/7 tour season, the Dunnetts were replaced by a prototype silver Yamaha metal snare later to be confirmed by BeaufordBuddy.com to be Carter's forthcoming Signature Snare. The Yamaha Signature \"Carter Beauford\" Snare Drum is still a prototype, not in production.\n\nDrums: Yamaha Recording Custom (first generation): \n\nCymbals: Zildjian: \n\nHeads: Remo: \n\nPercussion: LP:\n\nSticks: Vic Firth (formerly Promark sticks): \n\n\n"}

The area is and population is 3,139,153 (as of 2010); the city proper has 898,895 inhabitants (2010). The city was the administrative centre of the defunct Jirem League (; ).\n\nThe original Mongolian name for Tongliao city proper (i.e. Horqin District) is Bayisingtu (), while the original name of the prefecture-level city is \"Jirem\". The Mongolian dialect spoken in this area is Khorchin Mongolian.\n\nHuman settlement in Tongliao and surrounding Khorchin area dates from at least 1000 BC. The Donghu people, a tribe who spoke a proto-Mongolian language, settled in today's Tongliao area, north of Yan during Warring States period. their culture was associated with the Upper Xiajiadian culture, characterized by the practice of agriculture and animal husbandry supplemented by handicrafts and bronze art. Later, the Tongliao area was controlled by Xiongnu, Xianbei, and Khitan tribes.\n\nAfter the Mongolian Khanate had established the Yuan Dynasty in Chinese territory, Tongliao was put under the jurisdiction of Liaoyang province, whose provincial capital was in today's Liaoning Province. In the early Qing period, Khorchin, Dörbod, Jalaid and Gorlos tribes met in Jirem to establish an alliance, and the Jirem League was founded in 1636 to administer Khorchin territory. The Jirem League had jurisdiction over six Khorchin banners, two Gorlos banners, one Dorbod banner and one Jalaid banner. During the Republican period, the Jirem League and the surrounding Khorchin area was controlled by the Fengtian and Liaoning provinces.\n\nIn 1918, Tongliao County was first established under the administration of the Jirem League and Fengtian province. After the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria in 1931, a Japanese-controlled puppet state Manchukuo was established in Hsinking, 280 kilometers away from today's Tongliao urban area. The Manchukuo government set up Xing'an Province and soon divided it into four parts, in order to govern the western part of former Heilongjiang, Jilin and Fengtian provinces. These Xing'an provinces roughly overlap today's eastern part of Inner Mongolia, including today's Hulunbuir League, Xingan League, Chifeng and Tongliao. After the dissolution of the Manchukuo state, the Jirem League was governed by Liaoning and Liaobei provinces until Ulanhu established Inner Mongolia in Ulanhot, governing eastern Mongolian areas including the Hulunbuir, Jirem and Ju'ud leagues. After 1969, the Jirem League was put under the administration of Jilin province administration for 10 years until 1979. In 1999, the Jirem League became defunct and changed its name to Tongliao city, which was set up a prefecture-level city.\n\nTongliao spans latitude 42°15'45°41' and longitude 119°15'123°43', and borders Jilin province to the east, Liaoning to the south, Chifeng to the southwest, the Xilin Gol League to the west, and the Hinggan League to the north. Not far from Tongliao are silica sands. Tongliao has a total area of , accounting for 5.4% of Inner Mongolia's total.\n\nTongliao's topography primarily consists of plains, though the northern stretch of the prefecture extends into the eastern foothills of the southern Greater Khingan. The central and eastern parts of the prefecture are marked by the plains of the Xiliao, Xinkai River (), and Jiaolai rivers (), collectively forming the Sanhe Plain (). The highest point in the prefecture is Tunte'er Peak (), at .\n\nTongliao has a four-season, monsoon-influenced, continental steppe climate (Köppen \"BSk\"), with long, cold, windy, but dry winters, and hot, humid summers. Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July, with an annual mean of . Much of the year's rainfall occurs from June to August, and even then dry and sunny weather dominates in the city. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 57% in July to 78% in January, sunshine is abundant year-round, with 3,054 hours of bright sunshine annually.\n\nEthnic groups in Tongliao, 2000 census.\n\nTongliao is a railway hub in both Inner Mongolia and Northeast China. Tongliao-Beijing Railway conveniently connects the city with Beijing. There are also rails connect Tongliao with Shenyang, Daqing and Jining. State Highway 111, State Highway 303, State Highway 304 and State Highway 204 run through the city and extend to harbor cities such as Tianjin, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao.\n\nInner Mongolia University for Nationalities and Inner Mongolia College of Farming and Animal Husbandry are among the educational institutions of Tongliao.\n\n"}

An examination of the book conducted by Media Matters for America resulted in their viewpoint that \"Klein's Attack Book [was] Poorly Researched, Poorly Written, Poorly-Sourced.\" The media watchdog organization goes on to state that the author \"recycles long-debunked claims about the Clintons\" and \"relies on anonymous sources for much that isn't recycled—more than 70 footnotes refer to unnamed sources,\" and that the book has a \"reliance on 'convenient rather than complete evidence.'\"\n\nCommentator Joe Conason wrote that \"citizens hoping to discover anything new about the famous junior Senator from New York shouldn’t waste their time or money on his unoriginal and unreliable rant.\"\n\nPhilippe Reines, Hillary Clinton's press secretary, stated that the book was \"full of blatant and vicious fabrications contrived by someone who writes trash for cash.\"\n\nTo that end, Kathryn Jean Lopez of \"National Review\" asked Klein, \"Why on earth would you put such a terrible story in your book...that looks to be flimsily sourced at that?\" regarding his suggestion that Chelsea Clinton was conceived in an act of marital rape. Columnist John Podhoretz of \"The New York Post\" stated that the book is \"one of the most sordid volumes I've ever waded through.\" According to Alicia Colon of the \"New York Sun\", \"Mr. Klein’s title led me to believe that his book would be pointing out these little hypocrisies, but instead he grovels below the belt — delving into the Clintons’ sex life, which is the American people's business.\"\n\nWith the critical response to the book being so overwhelmingly negative, some commentators on the right have speculated that the book was intentionally written as a political device to indirectly boost support for a possible 2008 presidential run by Hillary Clinton. Proponents of this theory include former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan and talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Noonan, who also wrote a book critical of Hillary Clinton, states on the editorial page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" that Klein \"assumes the market is conservative and conservatives are stupid. They're not, actually. They want solid sourcing and new information that is true,\" concluding that this book only serves to \"inoculate [Hillary Clinton] against future and legitimate criticism and revelations.\"\n\nSome commentators on the left feel that the nearly unanimous condemnation of \"The Truth About Hillary\" by the right may also be a well-coordinated political maneuver. Indeed, Keelin McDonel states in the centrist political journal \"The New Republic\" that \"conservatives are launching a preemptive strike on what Klein identifies as one of Clinton's central mantras: 'victimhood can be a political plus.'\"\n\n"}

He was a founding member of the Dave Matthews Band. Moore often arranged music for songs written by Dave Matthews. Moore also co-wrote many of the band's songs, notably \"Too Much\" and \"Stay (Wasting Time)\".\n\nMoore was born September 7, 1961, in Durham, North Carolina, to Roxie Holloway Moore and Albert P. Moore. Raised in Virginia, he attended college at James Madison University studying tenor saxophone, and later became an accomplished jazz musician in Charlottesville, Virginia, playing with artists such as John D'earth and Dawn Thompson. Moore began playing professionally after a brief stay in college. Moore helped found the Charlottesville Swing Orchestra (1982), and the John D'earth Quintet. The latter played at Miller's, a Charlottesville bar, every Thursday night in the late 1980s, where Moore first met Dave Matthews in 1991. In an effort to bring in some instrumental help for some songs Matthews had written, Moore began recording songs with Matthews.\n\nMoore played bass, baritone, tenor, alto, and soprano saxophones, as well as the flute, bass clarinet, the wooden penny whistle, and the oboe. Moore's woodwind technician, David Saull, notes that Moore had \"quite an extensive horn collection.\"\n\nIn addition to performing with the Dave Matthews Band, Moore recorded a 1995 album with Thompson and Greg Howard under the name Code Magenta, combining improvised jazz grooves with spoken-word poetry. He also appeared on \"In November Sunlight\", the 1996 debut album of Sokoband (then known as Soko).\n\nMoore also worked as a producer with artist Samantha Farrell on her second album, \"Luminous\".\n\nMoore was injured on June 30, 2008, in an all-terrain vehicle accident on his farm outside Charlottesville, Virginia. His last live performance took place two days prior at the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia.\n\nJeff Coffin, the saxophonist from Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, stood in for Moore on subsequent tour dates, starting July 1, 2008, in Charlotte, North Carolina. This marked the first time a band member had missed a show since 1993, two years after the band was formed.\n\nMoore was riding an ATV on his farm to check a fence when he hit a grass-covered ditch, causing the ATV to flip and partially land on him. He broke several ribs and punctured a lung, and was hospitalized at UVA for several days. After his release, he was re-hospitalized in mid-July for complications related to the accident.\n\nAfter Moore was released again from the University of Virginia Health System, he traveled to his home in Los Angeles, to start his rehabilitation program. On the morning of August 19, Moore was feeling unwell and those present could see that his lips were turning blue. He was rushed to the hospital, but died shortly thereafter. While it was widely reported that he had died from a blood clot, the coroner's office determined his cause of death to be pneumonia.\n\nThe following statement was released on the band's website:\nWe are deeply saddened to announce that LeRoi Moore, saxophonist and founding member of Dave Matthews Band, died unexpectedly Tuesday afternoon, August 19, 2008, at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles from sudden complications stemming from his June ATV accident on his farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. LeRoi had recently returned to his Los Angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program.\n\nMatthews paid tribute to Moore on the day of his death at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, after the band's first song of the performance, \"Bartender.\" \"We all had some bad news today,\" Matthews told the sold-out crowd. \"Our good friend LeRoi Moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever.\" Fans then shouted Moore's name in remembrance.\n\nOn August 27, Moore was entombed at Holly Memorial Gardens in Albemarle County. Attendance at the funeral numbered in the thousands, including the rest of the band, Moore's family, and dedicated fans.\n\nMoore died three months shy of his planned November 8, 2008 wedding to Lisa Beane.\n\nDave Matthews Band released LeRoi Moore's final concert performance as \"Live Trax Vol. 14\". The concert took place in the band's home state of Virginia in Bristow on June 28, 2008. Proceeds from the CD were donated to local charities that Moore valued.\n\nOn September 30, 2008, during a concert in Brazil for the South American Tour, while the Dave Matthews Band was playing the introduction of \"#41,\" Brazilian fans spread white balloons around the concert house in order to pay homage to Moore. At this point, the band almost completely stopped playing and thanked the crowd for this amazing show of thanks to Moore. Violinist Boyd Tinsley was driven to tears by this homage to Moore.\n\nAfter Moore's death, Methane Studios, the company that creates most of the band's show posters, paid tribute to Moore on the posters that were sold at the shows. One such poster that was sold at a show on September 7, 2008, which would have been Moore's 47th birthday, has become a sought after collectors item among fans. Some sales of the poster have been seen as high as $600 on eBay.\n\nA second tribute poster was printed and released on September 6, 2009, and was sold during the final day of the Gorge '09 show. The poster was the King of Spades, a part of the Royal Flush series. There were 1100 printed and all prints sold out in the first hour.

When inhaled it is used for the long term management of asthma and COPD. In the nose it is used for hay fever and nasal polyps. It can also be used for mouth ulcers.\nCommon side effects when inhaled include upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, thrush, and cough. Common side effects when used in the nose include nosebleeding and sore throat. It works by decreasing inflammation.\nFluticasone propionate was patented in 1980, and approved for medical use in 1990. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States the wholesale cost per spray is about 0.33 USD as of 2018. In the United Kingdom, it costs the NHS about 0.13 GBP per spray as of 2019. In 2017, fluticasone was the 15th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 32 million prescriptions (up from 16th place & 29 million in 2016).\n\nFluticasone propionate is used by powder or aerosol inhalation for the prophylaxis of asthma. The nasal spray is used for prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis. Nasal drops are used in the treatment of nasal polyps. The nasal spray can also be used in the mouth for mouth ulcers.\n\nFluticasone propionate in a topical form can be used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and rashes.\n\nIf taken correctly, the nasal spray and oral inhaler formulation have fewer corticosteroid side effects than the tablet formulation because they limit systemic (blood) absorption. However, the systemic absorption is not negligible even with correct administration. Using the spray or inhaler at higher than recommended doses or with other corticosteroids can increase the risk for serious, systemic corticosteroid induced side effects. These side effects include weakened immune system, increased risk of systemic infections, osteoporosis, and elevated pressure in the eyes.\n\nCommon side effects may include nasal irritation (burning, stinging, bleeding), headache, upset stomach (nausea, vomiting), and diarrhea. Rare side effects include infection (evidenced by, e.g., fever, sore throat, and cough), vision problems, severe swelling, hoarse voice, and difficulty breathing or swallowing.\n\nCommon side effects may include upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, thrush, cough, and headache. Rare side effects include bruising, swelling of the face/neck, depression, tiredness, and shortness of breath.\n\nFluticasone propionate is a highly selective agonist at the glucocorticoid receptor with negligible activity at androgen, estrogen, or mineralocorticoid receptors, thereby producing anti-inflammatory and vasoconstriction effects. It has been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g. mast cell, eosinophil, neutrophil, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. Fluticasone propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without significant systemic effects at usual doses, due to its low systemic bioavailability.\n\nFluticasone propionate is broken down by CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4), and has been shown to interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir and ketoconazole.\n\nRitonavir is a common drug used in the treatment of HIV. Coadministration of ritonavir and fluticasone may lead to increased levels of fluticasone in the body, which may lead to Cushing's Syndrome and adrenal insufficiency.\n\nKetoconazole, an antifungal drug, has also been shown to increase fluticasone concentration leading to systemic corticosteroid side effects.\n\nFluticasone\n\n"}

It is located on the southwest corner of Front and Lower Jarvis Streets. Along with the St. Lawrence Market North and St. Lawrence Hall, it comprises the St. Lawrence Market complex. The current building was opened in 1902, incorporating the 1845 Toronto City Hall building into the structure. The building was restored during the 1970s.\n\nThe building has two main floors. The upper floor is the primary space and it extends through the full length of the building. It is one large open space with a large overhanging roof structure, and windows on each side. The lower level is partly underground, opening to the outdoors on the south end of the building. The lower floor does not extend the full length of the building. The market is located on the edge of the former lake shore, and the elevation drops over between the north and south ends. The south end of the lower floor opens to ground level at The Esplanade street. Surrounding the building along the east, west and south sides is a mezzanine, where seating and tables are available.\n\nOn the upper floor, over 50 vendors sell fruits, vegetables, meats and cheeses daily, while the lower floor has a portion that is non-food. Each vendor has an allotted stall space and there are several aisles. Several stalls sell sandwiches, such as the staple back bacon sandwich, and beverages such as coffee and tea. There are also craft and art vendors and kitchen supplies.\n\nAt the north end is a remnant of the old City Hall, providing two small upper floors. It houses the Market Gallery, operated by the City of Toronto, on the second floor and a cooking school (market kitchen) on the mezzanine floor. Opened in 1979, the Market Gallery offers changing exhibitions dedicated to Toronto's history, art and culture, and programs for school and community groups. The gallery space was formerly the 19th century city council chamber from 1845 to 1899.\n\nFree Wi-Fi is available throughout the South Market building, provided by Wireless Toronto.\n\nThe North Market, temporarily located south of the South Market due to the construction of a new building, houses a farmers' market each Saturday featuring 43 vendors inside the building and numerous cart vendors outside of the building, and an antiques market on Sundays.\n\nThe building was once home to Toronto's first permanent city hall and jailhouse from 1845 to 1899. It was designed by English immigrant architect Henry Bowyer Lane, who also designed Little Trinity Church in 1843, Holy Trinity Church in 1847, and expansion of Osgoode Hall in 1844. Lane's design was chosen over those submitted by William Thomas, John Tully and John George Howard. Lane incorporated into his design contrasting red brick and white stone in the Georgian architecture tradition. A “cupola” was built on the top front side of the building with a clock. Two-storey wings extended on either side of a three-story center block and housed the offices of city staff and shops on the ground floor. The centre block contained the Council Chambers, Toronto Police Station # 1 and a jail in the basement. It was built at a cost of $52,000. At the time, the south end of the building was on the lake front.\n\nThe \"New Market House\" was used as Toronto City Hall from 1845-1899. The yellow brick outline of the center part of that building can still be seen today in the front facade of the current building. The City Hall was renovated in 1851 by William Thomas, with new shops in the wings, keystones in the arched windows and improvements to the police station and jail cells (which were reportedly subject to flooding). More improvements were made between 1868 and 1872 by Henry Langley, who designed many churches and public buildings including the Metropolitan United Church. Railway lines were located on infill as the shoreline moved further south of the building.\n\nIn 1899, the City of Toronto decided to vacate the facility and move to a new city hall located on Queen Street West and Bay Street designed by E. J. Lennox. A Market Commission recommended the old city hall be renovated and turned into a large marketplace. John William Siddall was the selected architect for this project. Siddall decided to demolish the cupola, the pediment, and the side wings. The new steel truss roof was proposed to cover the entire building structure, allowing more open space with a high ceiling and more natural light. The roof is hybrid of arch roof with clerestory. The North Market was also rebuilt at this time and had a similar design to the current South building with late Victorian architecture design. The two buildings were joined with a glass canopy over Front Street. The South building opened in 1902 and the new North building opened in 1904.\n\nIn 1971, a consultant recommended the market be demolished. Time and Place, a citizens' group, proposed a renovation and that the former Council Chamber be converted into a \"City display space.\" The renovations lasted from 1974 to 1978 and included the opening up of the basement for retail use, a new floor for the main level, installation of a freight elevator and new doors to accommodate increased pedestrian traffic. The renovated Council Chambers opened as the Market Gallery, an exhibition facility to showcase the City's extensive archival and art collections, on March 7, 1979.\n\nThe St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood is featured extensively in the novel \"Old City Hall\", by Robert Rotenberg.\n\n\n"}

Housing approximately 185 students, it is one of the smaller colleges in the region. It was founded as Studholme House in 1915 to provide facilities for domestic science students. The college maintains close links with the Department of Human Nutrition (the successor to the university's School of Home Science), though it now accepts students from all faculties.\n\nStudholme College was established in 1915 as Studholme House, to provide accommodation for students attending the School of Home Science, which had been opened in 1911. It was named Studholme in honour of Colonel John Studholme who, after seeing the merits of home economics departments in US universities, had worked for the establishment of a School of Home Science in New Zealand. He was unsuccessful in establishing a chair at Canterbury College, so turned to the University of Otago, offering a personal endowment of £600 as an incentive.\n\nA search was conducted for a \"Lady Professor of Home Science\" and Professor Winifred Boys-Smith – a science and domestic science teacher at Cheltenham Ladies' College – was elected to the new chair. Over the first few years, Professor Boys-Smith allowed some training to occur in her own home and housed a few of the domestic science students.\n\nA more sustainable solution for student accommodation was achieved through the building of Studholme House in 1915 at the corner of Leith and Union Streets. While the school already had its own teaching facilities (\"The Old Tin Shed\", vacated by the School of Mines), they provided limited space and some degree of teaching was undertaken at the new House.\n\nExpansions occurred, in the form of two more Union Street houses, but by 1926 additional accommodation at nearby Arana had to be arranged to fill the deficit of space. Further houses were built over the next ten years and, by 1937, plans for a larger hall of residence had gained sufficient momentum for a substantial fund-raising campaign to begin. Due to the outbreak of war, difficulties finding qualified staff (exacerbated by a wage disparity between hostel and university teaching staff) and general financial hardship, plans were postponed and a variety of interim measures enacted, sending students to board and the use of university-lent accommodation.\n\nDuring this period, the fortieth anniversary of the school occurred and, as part of the celebrations, a coat of arms approved by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland was presented to Studholme House.\n\nIn 1955, encouragement came through the Minister of Finance, who promised to match money spent, pound-for-pound, on a new hall of residence and to provide a government grant of £18,400 for the building of a dining room block to train dietitians – the latter being completed in 1959. The large-scale campaign for funding took off again and, eventually, a contract price of £123,989, given by W.H. Naylor, Ltd was accepted. Funds were provided by the government, the work of local appeal committees around the country, private companies, associations and private gifts, as substantial as £10,000 (from Miss Annie E. Stevenson, one of the first graduates of the School). By 1961, a new ferro-concrete, six-story block was built, housing 109 students in single rooms, and four wardens. A number of improvements and additions were carried out on the original house, which subsequently provided a student common room, staff room and library, as well as the existing kitchen block.\n\nDuring the school's Golden Jubilee in 1961, the new Studholme Hall was officially opened by the then Governor-General, Sir Charles Lyttelton who commented, on the occasion, that \"there is no substitute, in terms of social progress, for living together in a community.\"\n\nIn 1994, sixteen further bedrooms were added, bringing the total number of beds to 136.\n\nA further 42 students live in six adjacent houses, which were acquired and fully integrated into the College in 1998. The houses are named after four former Wardens – Sally Keeling, Joan Dunn; Mary Dunn and Margaret Wallace – and Jane Malthus, who was a long serving member and chairwoman of the Studholme College Council.\n\nOn 20 May 2006, a resident student gave birth to a baby girl on a toilet in Studholme, and threw the dead newborn out of a window in a plastic bag. The student was convicted of infanticide, the conviction was later cancelled.\n"}

Aarons became a leader of a group of younger party officials who favoured a new leadership and a change in the party line. Admirers of the Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti, they became known as \"the Italians.\"\n\nDuring the Sino-Soviet Split of the early 1960s the CPA suffered a split which resulted in the formation of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), and Aarons led the majority pro-Soviet and anti-Chinese faction. In 1965 Sharkey finally retired and Aarons succeeded him as National Secretary of the party. He was a strong supporter of Nikita Khrushchev's liberalisation in the Soviet Union, and after Khrushchev's fall he became increasingly critical of the Soviet leadership's policies. In 1968 he welcomed Alexander Dubček's \"Prague Spring\" in Czechoslovakia, and bitterly criticised the Soviet-led occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. In 1969, at meeting of world Communist parties in Moscow, he made a speech strongly critical of the invasion and of Soviet policy under Leonid Brezhnev generally. In 1971 Aarons remained with the CPA following a split which produced the pro-Soviet Socialist Party of Australia (SPA).\n\nDuring the 1970s the CPA became a strong supporter of \"Eurocommunism\", abandoned Leninism and democratic centralism, and tried to form a \"united front\" of the various left-wing forces thrown up by the movement of opposition to the Vietnam War. But the party failed to recruit many new members from the New Left of the 1960s and '70s, and continued to decline in numbers and influence. Aarons retired as National Secretary in 1976, but remained influential in CPA affairs until the party was wound up in 1991. The SPA subsequently resumed the name \"Communist Party of Australia\".\n\nCommenting on his brother's career, Eric Aarons outlined what he considered Laurie Aarons's greatest achievements. One was to see that the Vietnam War would be the major political issue in Australia during the 1960s, and to place the CPA in the leadership of a broad antiwar movement. Another was to abandon democratic centralism and introduce genuine internal party democracy. A third was challenging the Soviet line over Czechoslovakia and other issues. In the long run, however, Aarons was unable to prevent the decline of the CPA and of Communist politics generally in Australia.\n\nDuring his declining years in the town of Maianbar, New South Wales, despite several painful medical conditions, Aarons continued to involve himself in community activities and to write books and articles. He died of cancer in Calvary Hospital, Sydney, on 7 February 2005, aged 87.\n\n"}

Its professed object was \"to promote an earnest Christian life among its members, to increase their mutual acquaintanceship, and to make them more useful in the service of God.\"\n\nThe Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor is an interdenominational Christian youth society which provided a structure for church youth to work together to know God in Jesus Christ. After the Society was described in a magazine article in 1882 the Society grew initially in the United States and then spread throughout the British Empire and beyond. The movement peaked during the last decade of the nineteenth century and then declined as denominational youth societies imitated and adapted the forms of Christian Endeavor. The Society continues in various locations into the twenty-first century.\n\nThe first Christian Endeavor Society was formed on Feb 2, 1881 in Portland, Maine, under the direction of Francis E. Clark. Rev. Clark founded the first national church youth organization, Christian Endeavor, the forerunner of the modern denominational \"youth fellowship\". The society was formed in order to bring youth to accept Christ and work for Him. The youth were shown that the church cared for young people. The Society enabled youth to express themselves while participating in useful tasks. It stressed a devoted, evangelistic spirit that was expressed in the Christian Endeavor pledge:\n\nChristian Endeavor created publications for youth, devised youth programs, and sponsored events. Christian Endeavor was maintained through private donations that often came from youth.\nChristian Endeavor began as a small group of youth that met at the house of their minister. Within a year, six societies had formed. After two years, the number of societies had grown to fifty-six. The organization expanded rapidly as it grew from a single church society into a world movement. By the end of the 19th century, Christian Endeavor was in the headlines of many major American newspapers. By 1906, 67,000 youth-led Christian Endeavor societies had been organized worldwide, with over four million members. Christian Endeavor took up many causes and was influential in supporting the temperance movement in the 1920s.\n\nChristian Endeavor began extensive publications in 1886. World conventions were held to address major issues. In 1887, Clark was elected president of the United Society, and in 1895 he was chosen as the World President of the Christian Endeavor Union. Clark held this position until his death in 1927. Daniel A. Poling then assumed the presidency. Christian Endeavor societies met at the state level for local control and met in World Conventions at intervals of three to six years. (World Conventions were held in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1937 and 1951.) The organization's world headquarters moved from Boston, Massachusetts, to Columbus, Ohio, in 1952. Christian Endeavor is still operating today throughout the world; their activities are widely reported on international and state Christian Endeavor Websites.\nDrawing on ideas taken from other pastors, especially Presbyterian Theodore L. Cuyler from Brooklyn, Clark shaped the concept of \"youth ministry\" by asking young people in his Williston Congregational Church to sign a two-sentence pledge described in his book published in 1882, The Children and the Church, and the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, as a means of Bringing Them Together. Previously youth had been classified with children and not considered capable of active Christian involvement.\n\nThe Christian Endeavor movement began February 2, 1881. The process, pledge(promise), and principles for starting a youth-led, adult-mentored ministry can be found at http://www.CEworks.faith. Churches can take steps to help young people be in ministry today. The Christian Endeavor World office is located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA. The General Secretary (CEO) is Dr. Dave Coryell from the USA. The President is Raffi Messerlian from Lebanon.\n\nPeople involved in Christian Endeavor gather every four years for a convention. The 29th C.E. World Convention will be held July 2019 in Flensunger Hof, Germany.\n\nChristian Endeavor meetings are described in both \"Cloudy Jewel\" and \"The Girl from Montana\", by Christian author Grace Livingston-Hill.\n\n"}

The scheme, which is open to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, sees students save thousands of dollars on the cost of their tertiary education. The Institute is also renowned for the quality of its facilities and equipment. On 1 April 2020, Southern Institute of Technology will be subsumed into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs).\n\nSIT offers over 200 programmes in a range of academic, technical and professional subjects at postgraduate, graduate, bachelor, diploma and certificate levels. SIT is a member of the International Association of Universities.\n\nSIT has several campuses around Invercargill (SIT Tay Street, Downtown and SIT Sound) with other campuses located in Queenstown, Gore, Telford, Christchurch and Auckland, and has a distance education faculty, SIT2LRN. In 2018 SIT acquired MAINZ, the Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand, and operates MAINZ campuses in Auckland and Christchurch.\n\nA new campus, the SIT Creative Centre will open in 2020, on the site of the historic St Johns Church.\n\nSIT has three campuses in Invercargill. The main campus is situated either side of Tay Street. \"SIT Downtown\" is situated in the center of Invercargill’s business district and is home to new media and arts programmes. \"SIT Sound\" in the Invercargill Radio Network Building hosts audio production programmes.\n\nSIT has undertaken a major campus redevelopment plan over the past fifteen years. This includes the completion of new classrooms, development of the SIT Library complex which includes the \"Literacy and Numeracy Resource Center\" and \"Teaching and Development Support Unit\", and the redevelopment of the Student Services area.\n\nIn 2012, SIT completed a NZ$5.5 million redevelopment of the trades and technology teaching and learning areas which included a new \"Industry Training Center\". 2012 also saw the redevelopment of the School of Nursing, which included the addition of a new multi-million dollar \"Nursing Simulation Center\" and the refurbishment of related facilities.\n\nThe Gore campus provides a base for the catchment areas of Eastern Southland, Northern Southland and West Otago.\n\nThe Queenstown campus operates from a new facility in the Remarkables Park retail and commercial development area in Frankton. The campus offers business, administration, computing, hospitality, tourism, sports, beauty therapy and hairdressing programmes.\n\nSIT’s Christchurch campus is based in Hornby. The campus offers specialised training in a number of areas including carpentry, electrical, refrigeration and air conditioning, roofing, automotive, sports, and mental health support.\n\nThe Telford (Balclutha) campus extends over 921 hectares of farmland with halls of residence and facilities, technical workshops (machinery, carpentry and welding), classrooms and livestock units.\n\nThe SIT campus in Auckland operates on Level 2 of the MAINZ building and offers blended delivery programmes in conjunction with SIT2LRN\n\nThe Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand is a faculty of the Southern Institute of Technology (SIT) with campuses in Auckland Central and Christchurch. MAINZ offers a range of programmes designed with the music industry in mind including Music Performance, Audio Engineering/Production, DJ, and Event Management\n\nIn 2003, two years after the launch of the Zero Fees Scheme, SIT launched its flexible mixed mode delivery (or distance education) faculty, SIT2LRN. SIT2LRN was made possible through a partnership with Southland TV (now CUE TV) where SIT could use television and internet technology to provide distance learning. Initially, SIT offered just one academic qualification – a Diploma in Tourism and Hotel Management – and attracted an online student body of just 22. By 2012, SIT2LRN offered over 30 different programmes in a range of subject areas.\n\nSIT is the only tertiary provider in New Zealand to offer a \"Zero Fees Scheme\" where New Zealand citizens and permanent residents are only required to pay material costs and not tuition fees. The scheme has been credited with revitalising Invercargill after it attracted thousands of students south. The Zero Fees Scheme has also been extended to international students, in the form of Zero Fees English and Foundation Scholarships.\n\nThe Zero Fees Scheme delivers significant savings for students who study at SIT compared with other tertiary institutions. Since students need only pay for their material costs, many students graduate debt free. Students can save between NZ$7,000 to $14,000 on the cost of their bachelor's degrees.\n\nThe scheme was initiated in an attempt to jumpstart Invercargill’s economy. In the late 1990s, Invercargill was suffering from job losses, closing businesses and a declining population. In an attempt to reverse this situation, and attract more young people to the city, the Zero Fees Scheme was implemented.\n\nThe scheme saw community funders contribute $7.2 million over three years to effectively pay students’ tuition fees. All students had to pay was their material costs – for things like uniforms or textbooks. The expected boost in the student population meant that, after that time – with more government funding for the extra equivalent full-time students – the scheme would become self-funding.\n\nThe success of the Zero Fees scheme has meant SIT has been able to keep fees for international students low. The Zero Fees Scheme has even been extended to international students, in the form of the Zero Fees English and Zero Fees Foundation Studies programmes. These programmes allow international students to study English or Foundation programmes for free when they subsequently enrol in a one-year or longer mainstream academic programme.\n\nSIT offers over 200 programmes from pre-degree to postgraduate level.\n\nThe SIT Library has more than 25,000 books, 750,000 E-books, multiple online databases, and also magazines, DVDs and novels. Additional services include multi-function printers, wireless internet access and more than 20 computers for student use. There is also a group study room furnished with an overhead projector.\n\nThe SIT Gym is located on the corner of Tay and Conon Streets. It has recently undergone a complete refurbishment. Programmes are available for fitness, rehabilitation, strength, health and high performance.\n\nThe School of Hospitality has two commercial training kitchens that can fit up to 20 students each. Each kitchen is equipped with equipment for each workstation, including six burner gas hobs and convection or gas ovens. The Bungalow Restaurant is an onsite restaurant which is used for training and theory as well as practice restaurant service operations open to the public throughout the year. Café and Bar service students also operate from the Bungalow Restaurant. The Vault Café is used as a real life training environment where students prepare and present food and coffee to the public on a regular basis throughout the year.\n\nSIT runs an applied research programme designed to support the development of its community and New Zealand industry. The SIT Research Institute is an organisation which works across the faculties and schools to support and promote staff research at SIT, as well as carrying out research in collaboration with local and regional partners.\n\nSince 2010 the SIT Research Institute has been involved in a number of local and national research projects including research projects with Water Safety New Zealand and Sport Southland to support safe swimming practices and with the Centre for Research on Children and Families at the University of Otago and Our Way Southland to strengthen parenting in the region. The SIT Research Institute also led \"The Committed Learners Project\", a collaborative research project with other New Zealand Institutes of Technology that identified practices to foster student engagement.\n\nThe Southern Institute of Technology Journal of Applied Research (SITJAR) is an online journal that specialises in applied research in the vocational and educational sector. SITJAR is a double-blind, peer refereed journal, that is freely accessible.\n\nSIT offers a range of learning modes. These include full-time and part-time, flexible mixed mode delivery, workplace locations (including work place training and assessments), apprenticeship schemes (managed and modern), multi site arrangements with secondary schools and articulations. Many courses have work experience components and practicums. Southland Museum and Art Gallery\n\nSIT has developed links with a range of community organisations, including local councils, iwi, trusts, government agencies, businesses and other organisations. SIT worked with the Community Trust of Southland, the Invercargill Licensing Trust, the Invercargill City Council, the Southland District Council and many Southland businesses to launch the Zero Fees Scheme as well as subsequent initiatives. SIT has active relationships with Venture Southland, the region’s economic development agency, and the Southland Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSIT has sponsored and supported numerous Southland community organisations, such as Rugby Southland, Netball Southland, Basketball Southland, Southland Art Foundation, Southland Artist in Residence, as well as Southland’s national motor-racing champion and Southland’s Olympic representatives and Paralympic medal winner.\n\nSIT provides SIT Centrestage for the benefit of the Southland Arts community. This includes the provision of weekly music and drama performances in the theatre by SIT students, and the annual Kids’ Concert for approximately 2,500 children.\n\nSIT helped secure the Southland filming of Robert Sarkies film \"Two Little Boys\", Claire Kelly’s \"The Jub Jub Bird\" and the joint New Zealand–Denmark produced \"Weight of Elephants\", in which SIT film students gained valuable work experience and subsequent employment in the industry. In 2010, SIT hosted the University Games for the first time in Southland. In 2011, SIT gifted the use of the SIT Arcade in Invercargill’s central business district as the venue for the 2011 Rugby World Cup Fan Zone in Southland.\n\nSIT hosts a rapidly growing number of international students. SIT's international strategy was adopted as an explicit attempt to address labour shortages in Southland. In 2012, over 626 students from 42 different countries around the world studied at SIT. SIT also has a cosmopolitan staff, with an eighth of its staff in 2012 hailing from overseas.\n\nSIT has a number of international partnerships and is a member of the International Association of Universities.\n\nSIT offers accommodation at the SIT Apartments. and homestay is available for international students.\n\nFrom 2018 SIT offers the Mayor Tim Shadbolt Accommodation Bursary, open to students studying in Southland who are in their first year of tertiary study.\n"}

The album was produced by Erasure, along with Gareth Jones and Mark Saunders and released by Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the US.\n\nAlthough the album did not generate any entries on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Wild!\" is highly regarded amongst Erasure's fanbase as one of their best albums, containing now-classic singles like \"Drama!\", \"Blue Savannah\" and \"Star\". In the US, several songs gained exposure on college radio and three songs charted on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. \"You Surround Me\" was not released as a single in the United States.\n\nDuring production, singer Andy Bell recorded with producer Gareth Jones, while Vince Clarke handled synths and programming with producer Mark Saunders at Vince's home studio -- both in London.\n\nIn the UK, \"Wild!\" continued Erasure's mainstream success: it became their second consecutive number one album and four singles hit the UK Top 20. The album also charted well in Germany, where it hit number sixteen.\n\nIt was while promoting the \"Wild!\" album that Erasure launched the first of their many elaborately staged concert tours - this one featuring gigantic sets and props and several costume changes for band members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, as well as several back-up singers and dancers. Over 100 dates were played, culminating in their biggest headlining show at the Milton Keynes Bowl in front of 60,000 fans.\n\nAll tracks written by Andy Bell and Vince Clarke.\n\n\nSubsequent to their acquisition of Erasure's back catalogue, and in anticipation of the band's 30th anniversary, BMG commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007's \"Light at the End of the World\". All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gram vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.\n\nA two-disc version of the album was released by BMG in the UK and Europe on March 29, 2019 to commemorate the original 1989 release.

Morse, who, in addition to his other more famous pursuits, was an avid daguerreotypist. The partnership's studio, located on the top floor of a Boston building, had enormous skylights to allow in copious amounts of light necessary for relatively \"short\" exposures of portraits of their subjects. While they worked in formats ranging from the more common locket-sized daguerreotype, up to a stereoscopic image (also gaining in popularity at the time), they specialized in \"whole plate\" images, an expensive size which measured 6½ × 8½ inches (16.5 × 21.6 cm)—rather large for a daguerreotype. Lawmaker Daniel Webster, author Harriet Beecher Stowe, and reformer Dorothea Dix were among the duo's more prominent clients, but they also photographed local businessmen, society ladies, and other Boston-area citizens.\n\nSouthworth & Hawes were not alone: Masury & Silsby, and also John Adams Whipple were prominent Boston daguerreotypists. Whipple's and Southworth & Hawes's operations were the largest in Boston, and were outshone in America (after 1853) only by the New York studios of Mathew Brady and M.M. Lawrence.\n\nIn what could perhaps be called the ancestor of the View-master, Southworth & Hawes invented a \"grand parlor stereoscope\", which allowed viewers to be presented with new daguerreotype views with the turn of a crank. Southworth & Hawes had one of these devices in the reception room of their gallery for the entertainment of their customers.\n\nAfter wet-process plate printing came into vogue, Southworth also invented a device in 1855 that allowed up to eight exposures of the same sitter to be made in just two sequential exposures: by exposing half of a whole plate with a special four-lensed set of tubes, then moving the other half of the plate into place, the other half of the plate was then exposed.\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the fifth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nSeward has also been a member of the Indianapolis Colts and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAdam Hartford Seward was born on June 15, 1982, at Carle Clinic Hospital in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. Seward attended Bonanza High School in Las Vegas, NV. He was a two-time All-State selection at linebacker and a starting running back. His biggest game came during his senior season at national powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School. Seward rushed for over 200 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Bengals, who were big underdogs, to an overtime victory over the Gaels. The game is currently Bonanza's last victory over Bishop Gorman in football.\n\nIn addition to football, he was a star athlete in track (shot put and discus), and won the Nevada state heavyweight title in wrestling. He and former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir, who were teammates in 1998, are among the 12 state wrestling champions in Bonanza High School's history.\n\nKnown as one of the top defensive players in the State of Nevada during his senior year, Seward opted to stay home and signed a scholarship offer to attend college in his hometown at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he played four years for the Rebels. He became a starter during his freshman season and went on to be named All-Mountain West Conference three times. When he graduated in 2004, he left as both UNLV's and the Mountain West Conference's all-time leader in tackles (Though his UNLV record still stands, New Mexico's Carmen Messina would go on to break his MWC record during his final game of the 2011 season). He also had six sacks, six forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries, and two interceptions. Seward was also an active member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.\n\nAt the 2005 NFL combine, Seward (248 lbs.) was clocked at 4.56 in the 40-yard dash, leading many NFL scouts to believe that he would be a late second to early third round pick. However, scouts soon discovered a broken bone in his right foot, which caused his draft stock to fall dramatically. Nevertheless, Seward was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the 5th round (149th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Seward rapidly became a star special teams player and back-up linebacker during his rookie season. Over the course of his career with the Panthers, he was frequently known as one of Carolina's best special teams players. He also served as a backup to All-Pro linebackers Dan Morgan and Jon Beason. In 2008, with one of the best defenses in the NFL, Carolina compiled a record of 12-4 and won the NFC South.\n\nAfter a successful four-year stint with the Panthers that include two playoff runs and a trip to the 2005 NFC Championship Game, Seward signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an Unrestricted Free Agent. Though released during the 2009 preseason, Seward would sign with the Jacksonville Jaguars the very next day. He spent the 2009-10 season as a member of the Jaguars.\n\nIn 2010, after undergoing surgery to repair a sports hernia that required intensive repairs to not only the abdominal area, but also to several tendons in the right leg, Seward retired from the NFL and took a job with the NFL's representative office in Mexico City. He also hosted a Spanish-language radio show in Mexico City aimed at promoting football in Latin America. In 2011, he received two top-level Spanish-language certifications from Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.\n\nAfter achieving success in Mexico, Seward was employed by the NFL's representative office in Beijing, China. In 2012, he served as a Chinese-language analyst for NFL football in China on Sina-Weibo.\n\nIn 2014, Seward was named the defensive coordinator of the Kyoto University football team in Kyoto, Japan. \n\nCurrently, Seward serves as the president of Goober Foundation Properties, Ltd., a real estate investment, management, and development firm. The company specializes in multi-family properties and land development with operations in four states.\n\nSeward holds a master's degree in business administration from the University of Southern California. He is fluent in Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nHis father, Tom, played for Eastern Illinois University, and was the co-captain of the squad which won the NCAA Division II football title in 1978. He later was an assistant coach for The University of Illinois, Howard University, University of Nevada Las Vegas, and Southern Illinois University. Seward's mother, Amy, was a cheerleader for the Chicago Bears.\n\nHis younger brother, Mark, played college football for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\n"}

The film is based on a 1943 novel by Margaret Carpenter and directed by Jacques Tourneur. Albert S. D'Agostino, Jack Okey, Darrell Silvera, and Claude E. Carpenter were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White. Hedy Lamarr's singing voice was dubbed by Paula Raymond.\n\nThe story takes place in 1903. During a train trip, psychiatrist Dr. Huntington Bailey (George Brent) meets a friendly older lady (Olive Blakeney), when she turns to him for reassurance during a torrential downpour. She tells him that she is going to visit her brother Nick and his lovely young wife Allida, both of whom she effectively raised. Once in New York, Bailey hears that his train companion suddenly died while visiting her brother for tea. Shortly afterwards, he meets the strange couple and becomes suspicious of Nick's treatment of his wife. Nick (Paul Lukas) keeps Allida (Hedy Lamarr), whom he is trying to pass off as crazy, a virtual prisoner in their town house (a New York brownstone in the film), cutting off all contact with the outside world. The kindly Bailey takes it upon himself to attempt to free his new love, Allida, from the control of the insanely jealous Nick.\n\nA frenzied gun battle and fist fight in their home, featuring the destruction of several large aquariums, replete with shattered glass, gushing water and floundering fish, may be the most memorable (and most often imitated) scene in the film.

Among the musicians in his band were the Dorsey Brothers, Joe Venuti, Bunny Berigan, and Benny Goodman. In the early 1930s, Elmer Feldkamp was one of his vocalists.\n\nRich was born in Warsaw, Poland. He was a pianist and formed his band in the 1920s. His theme songs were \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" and \"So Beats My Heart for You.\" Between 1925–1928, he toured Europe. He enjoyed a long stay at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. He began leading a studio band and recorded for Okeh, Columbia, Paramount, Camden, and Vocalion, often under the names Fred Richards, the Astorites, and the Hotel Astor Band. Rich and his band served as their house band for a time in the 1920s. In the late 1930s, he became musical director for radio stations. In 1942 he moved to a staff position with United Artists Studios in Hollywood, where he remained for most of his career.\n\nRich's band played for several network radio programs, including The Abbott and Costello Show.\n\nMost of Rich's records are typical dance fare of the era. However, during the period between November 1929 and March 1931, there was a scattering of hot jazz versions of popular tunes, with notable solos by Bunny Berigan, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, and Eddie Lang. These celebrated recordings include 'A Peach of a Pair\" (October 29, 1930), \"I Got Rhythm\"(October 29, 1930), \"Cheerful Little Earful\" (November 19, 1930), and \"I'm Tickled Pink with a Blue-Eyed Baby\" (November 19, 1930).\n\nAs \"Freddie Rich,\" he recorded dozens of popular-title piano rolls in the 1920s for the Aeolian Company, both for its reproducing Duo-Art system and its 88 note Mel-O-Dee label. Rich also contributed to the composition of a novelty song\"I'm Just Wild About Animal Crackers\". He has a number of song credits to his name, including \"Blue Tahitian Moonlight,\" \"Time Will Tell\", and \"On the Riviera.\" He also wrote scores for movies.\n\nIn 1945, Rich was badly injured when he suffered a fall. As a result, he suffered from partial paralysis. But despite this, Rich continued to lead studio bands into the 1950s. Fred Rich died on September 8, 1956 in California at the age of 58 after a long illness.\n\n"}

It lives in shallow waters from the low-tide line to greater than deep, and is typically found on rocky shores sheltered from extreme wave action.\n\nA sea urchin's spherical body is completely covered by sharp spines. These spines grow on a hard shell called the \"test\", which encloses the animal. It can vary in color from red to dark burgundy. Rarely, albino specimens are found. It has a mouth located on its underside, which is surrounded by five teeth. During larval development, the body of a sea urchin transitions from bilateral to radial symmetry.\n\nThis bilaterally symmetrical larva, called an echinopluteus, subsequently develops a type of pentaradiate symmetry that characterises echinoderms. It crawls very slowly over the sea bottom using its spines as stilts, with the help of its tube feet. Scattered among its spines are rows of tiny tube feet with suckers that help it to move and stick to the sea floor.\n\nThis animal has a mouth with special jaws (Aristotle's lantern) located on the bottom (oral) surface. Its preferred diet is seaweeds and algae, which it scrapes off and tears up from the sea floor. During larval development, urchins use bands of cilia to capture food from the water column. Red sea urchins found in the channel adjacent to San Juan Island have been found to live a uniquely sedentary lifestyle with the heavy currents bringing an abundance of food.\n\nSea urchins are often found living in clumps from five to ten. They have the ability to regenerate lost spines. Lifespan often exceeds 30 years, and scientists have found some specimens to be over 200 years old. Red sea urchins are notoriously ravenous kelp-eaters and are implicated in devastating kelp beds by forming grazing fronts. The intense grazing pressure exerted by urchins is an important link in a trophic cascade often observed along the west coast of North America in which sea otter predation influences urchin abundance, which in turn influences kelp devastation. In contrast to their negatively perceived impact on community structure in open coastal kelp beds, the sedentary behavior and capture of detrital seaweed in the San Juan Islands is hypothesized to create an important habitat and energy source below the photic zone. These diverse ecosystem effects of red urchins highlight their importance as ecosystem engineers in temperate rocky reef ecosystems.\n\nSpawning peaks between June and September. Eggs are fertilized externally while they float in the ocean, and planktonic larvae remain in the water column for about a month before settling on the bottom of the sea floor, where they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile urchins. These juveniles use chemical cues to locate adults. Although juveniles are found almost exclusively under aggregated adults, the adults and juveniles are not directly related.\n\n"}

He was a son of the famous Texas hero and statesman Sam Houston and his wife Margaret Lea Houston, and was named for his father's mentor Andrew Jackson. He served briefly as a United States Senator in 1941, appointed to temporarily fill the vacancy left by the death of longtime Senator Morris Sheppard.\n\nAndrew J. Houston was born in Independence, Texas, on June 21, 1854. He was educated at several military academies and colleges, including Baylor University and West Point—a member of the Class of 1875, he dropped out before graduating. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1876.\n\nHouston had a varied career, including serving as clerk of the federal court in Dallas, a colonel in the Texas National Guard and United States Marshal for the eastern district of Texas.\n\nHouston ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Texas in 1892 as a lily-white Republican candidate.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War Houston raised and organized a cavalry troop which was mustered into service as part of the Rough Riders. In 1910 and 1918 he was a Prohibition Party candidate for Governor.\n\nA longtime resident of La Porte, in 1918 he retired to study and write history. From 1924 until his Senate appointment he held a sinecure as Superintendent of the state park at the San Jacinto battleground, where his father had won the battle which led to the independence of Texas from Mexico.\n\nHouston's semi-retirement ended in 1941, when John Morris Sheppard died while representing Texas in the United States Senate.\n\nTexas Governor W. Lee O'Daniel desired to serve in the Senate, but knew it would be politically unpopular to name himself as the interim appointee pending a special election for the remainder of Sheppard's term. Certain that the 86-year-old Houston would not run in the special election, O'Daniel appointed him to temporarily fill the vacancy. At the time of his swearing in, 82 years after his father had served in the same seat, Houston was the oldest man to enter the Senate. (The oldest person was Rebecca Latimer Felton).\n\nHouston joined the Senate as a Democrat, and filled the seat from April 21, 1941, until his death. The early June trip from Texas to Washington, D.C., to begin his duties had a negative effect on Houston's health, and he attended only one committee meeting as a senator, afterwards spending most of his time hospitalized.\n\nHouston died in a Baltimore, Maryland, hospital on June 26, 1941, five days after his 87th birthday. Houston was briefly interred at Abbey Mausoleum in Arlington County, Virginia. He was later disinterred and reburied in the Texas State Cemetery.\n\nIn the special election held a few days after Houston's death, O'Daniel defeated Lyndon B. Johnson and several other candidates, and won the seat.\n\nHouston is one of 4 Senators (the others being William Johnson, Edmund Pettus and Strom Thurmond) to be the oldest living U.S. Senator while serving and he is the only Senator subsequent to the second U.S. Congress to become the oldest living Senator upon entering office.\n\nHouston was married twice; his first wife was Carrie Glenn Purnell of Austin, who died in 1884. His second wife, Elizabeth Hart Goode of Dallas died in 1907. Houston was the father of three daughters, Ariadne, Marguerite, and Josephine; Ariadne and Marguerite largely devoted their adult lives to caring for their father. Both Ariadne and Marguerite traveled with him to Washington after his Senate appointment, and they were with him when he died.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2060392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060392", "title": "Pair by association", "text": "Pair by association\n\nIn relation to psychology, pair by association is the action of associating a stimulus with an arbitrary idea or object, eliciting a response, usually emotional. This is done by repeatedly pairing the stimulus with the arbitrary object.\n\nFor example, repeatedly pairing images of beautiful women in bathing suits elicits a sexual response in most men. Advertising agencies repeatedly pair products with attractive women in television commercials with the intention of eliciting an emotional or sexually aroused response in the consumer. This causes the consumer to be more likely to buy the product than when presented with a similar product without such an association.\n\nThe hippocampal area, beyond its importance in episodic memory is in part responsible in the creation and storage of associations in the memory, especially for item associations. Furthermore, as stated by Gilbert & Kesner, the associations that are created are those that might be \"“critical”\" in paired-associative learning. Through studies on rats, it has been found that lesions to the hippocampus lead to object-place associative learning impairments. The findings of hippocampal damage that lead to impairments in the association between object-place as Gilbert & Kesner state have been seen in not only rodents but also non-human primates and humans . Previously learned associations made before the damage to the hippocampal area were not affected with impairment. Gilbert & Kesner have suggested in their work that this ability to still recall previously stored associations may be due to modified synapses in an \"“auto associative network”\".\n\nPaired association learning can be defined as a system of learning in which items (such as words, letters, numbers, symbols etc.) are matched so that presentation of one member of the pair will cue the recall of the other member. It is this learning which constitutes the basics in a paired-associate task. These tasks can be divided into the following: visual-visual, verbal-verbal, and visual-verbal. In visual-visual both members of the pair are in a visual form (e.g. the picture of a blue circle paired with that of a picture of a yellow triangle). The verbal-verbal is when the members of the pair are both verbally presented (e.g. listening to the word cat followed by the word hat spoken to a participant). The last form, visual-verbal is when one member of the pair is spoken out loud while the other member is presented in a visual form (e.g. listening to the word box and seeing a picture of a house). Visual associative learning has a positive association with age. In school age children, their visual association ability grows in conjunction with their age; younger children made more errors while older children made less.\nThe paired association task broken down to its basics is: a stimuli, response, and the consequence of the cue association. This is best seen in a study where Naya, Sakai, & Miyashita performed one version of the task on monkeys. In the study a primate was given a visual-visual paired-associate task where they were shown all the pairs in the set. Then after a long delay they displayed one picture of a pair to the primate. When the correct picture was paired by the monkey, showing that the pictures were cueing the response, they were given rewards in the form of food. What this study shows is that it is possible for associations to occur for two previously unrelated items. The monkeys showed they had actually remembered what was shown to them. In visual associative learning, the efficiency of the participant/subject in making these connections actually will decrease as the “memory load” increases. The more items/the higher the complexity that one has to keep in their memory leads to poorer performance on paired associative learning tasks.\nGluck, Mercado, and Myers explain how paired-association is possibly tied to encoding rather than retrieval. In the study presented by Gluck et al., there was a paired associates test where after studying word pairs the participants were presented with one word from the pair and required to recall the match there was a noticeable difference in accuracy between the young adult and older adults. At the start of the study each pair was shown for 15 seconds, in this the older adults had much worse performance; their recall abilities paled in comparison to the younger adults. This however did change when the time was doubled to that of 30 seconds; here the elderly were able to have a much improved performance level. It is an accepted understanding that in associative learning there is a negative regression, as one ages their performance levels decrease. The regression remains even after addressing the possible interfering variables such as attention or spatial memory.\n\nWhen the paired association task is performed, there are ways in which the performance in the task can be either negatively or positively affected. Associations suffer when an item is shared between associations; double function pairs such as AB and BC will be harder to recall later than control pairs such as AB and CD. As Caplan et al., state double function pairs create what is called association ambiguity, a sharing of a common member in the pair, which leads to interference. The brain has difficulty in processing the pairs to the point that in some cases one pair will be remembered at the expense of the other pair. An example is in the two word pairs CAR-HORN and CAR-DOG. In this word pair a participant would remember 1 pair primarily while forgetting the other pair. Memory for ambiguous pairs will often suffer compared to unambiguous pairs in both situations of e.g. AB and BC or AB and AC. One matter that is not affected is a cue recall in either direction, forward (cue A, recall B) or backward (cue B, recall A); either direction will not affect the accuracy of the recall. This also holds true for double function pairs.\nAdditionally, there is ongoing research into the effects ecstasy/polystimulant use has on paired-associate task/learning. In a study by Gallagher et al., it was found that those who used ecstasy/polydrugs had in general more false positive responses, clicking yes (in agreement) when asked if a word pair had been previously presented even if the reality was false, compared to non-users. It was proposed that because creating the association between word pairs requires executive resources, which has been known to be hampered in ecstasy users. This is what has prevented the binding of word pairs. However, as stated by the author, it is not possible to fully attribute these deficits in the task, but it bears noting that there are differences occurring.\nAn association can be improved with the aid of the production effect which is a finding where speaking a word out loud leads to enhancements in memory compared to reading a word silently. The production effect is not limited to speaking a word aloud; mouthing, writing, whispering, spelling, and typing all lead to an enhanced memory though the level will not be the same as reading aloud. In accordance with Putnam et al., the enhancement in recall in the production effect is because reading aloud creates a more distinctive memory in the encoding process. Moreover, the production effect improved not only pair recognition but also paired-associate recall. These findings hint at a positive link between the production effect and the association between pairs in relation to paired-associate task/learning; using one of the elements in the production effect leads to improved encoding of associations.\n\nBehaviorists will often use paired association tests to determine the strength of verbal behavior, in particular, B.F Skinner's concept of the verbal response class called intraverbals.\n\n\n"}

He was previously a member of the United States House of Representatives, serving Vermont's At-large congressional district, from 1951 to 1959.\n\nWinston Prouty was born in Newport, Vermont, to Willard Robert and Margaret (née Lockhart) Prouty. His family owned Prouty & Miller Lumber Company, a lumber and building material business. His family was also involved in politics; his father and grandfather both served as state legislators, his uncle Charles A. Prouty was a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and his other uncle George H. Prouty served as Governor of Vermont (1908–1910).\n\nHe received his early education at public schools in Newport, and attended the Bordentown Military Institute in New Jersey. He graduated from The Hill School in 1924. He then studied at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, from which he received his bachelor of science degree in 1930. During college, he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.\n\nProuty returned to Newport and joined his family's business, Prouty & Miller. He also served as a director of the National Bank of Newport and Associated Industries of Vermont. Though described as shy and reticent, in part because he was self-conscious about the loss of his right thumb in an accident at his family's business, Prouty decided on a career in politics. A Republican, he was a member of the Newport City Council from 1933 to 1937. He served as mayor of Newport from 1938 to 1941. He was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1940, and served from 1941 to 1949. During his last two years in the legislature, he served as Speaker of the House. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont in 1948, losing to Harold J. Arthur. From 1949 to 1950, he served as chairman of the state Water Conservation Board.\n\nIn 1950, after longtime incumbent Charles Albert Plumley decided not to run again, Prouty announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives from Vermont's At-large congressional district. He won the Republican nomination in a four-way race that included Governor Arthur. In the general election, he defeated his Democratic opponent, Herbert B. Comings, by a margin of 73%-26%. He was subsequently re-elected to three more terms, never receiving less than 61% of the vote. During his tenure in the House, Prouty served as a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was an advocate for the creation of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. During his tenure in the House, Prouty voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nHe was elected to the United States Senate in 1958; he reelected in 1964 and 1970 and served from January 3, 1959 until his death. In the Senate, Prouty's committee assignments included District of Columbia, Rules, Labor and Public Welfare, and Commerce, in addition to the Special Committee on Aging and the Select Committee on Small Business. Issues with which he was identified included federal aid for school construction, federal funding of courses for students with special needs, arts and music education, and senior citizen needs to include health care and expansion of Social Security eligibility. In addition, he was a longtime advocate for returning passenger rail service to Vermont. As the ranking Republican on the District of Columbia Committee, Prouty sponsored the legislation that created the district's Delegate to Congress. During his tenure in the Senate, Prouty voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nProuty died from the effects of gastric cancer at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston on September 10, 1971. He was buried at Pine Grove Cemetery in Newport.\n\nIn 1939, Prouty married Frances Currie Hearle Backus (1907-1960) of Stanstead, Quebec, who was the mother of three daughters from a previous marriage, Currie, Elizabeth, and Ann. She died in 1960, and in 1962, Prouty married Jennette Herbert Hall (1913-2002), who had been the chief aide to Congressmen Henry J. Latham of New York and Robert E.

The TA*T and CG*C+ base pairs are the most stabilized triplet-base pairs that can form, while a TA*G and CG*G are the most destabilized triplet-base pairs.\n\nThere are two classes of triplex DNA: intermolecular and intramolecular formations. An intermolecular triplex refers to triplex formation between a duplex and a different (third) strand of DNA. The third strand can either be from a neighboring chromosome or a triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO). Intramolecular triplex DNA is formed from a duplex with homopurine and homopyrimidine strands with mirror repeat symmetry. The degree of supercoiling in DNA influences the amount of intramolecular triplex formation that occurs. There are two different types of intramolecular triplex DNA: H-DNA and H*-DNA. Formation of H-DNA is stabilized under acidic conditions and in the presence of divalent cations such as Mg. In this conformation, the homopyrimidine strand in the duplex bends back to bind to the purine strand in a parallel fashion. The base triads used to stabilize this conformation are T-A*T and C-G*C. The cytosine of this base triad needs to be protonated in order to form this intramolecular triple helix, which is why this conformation is stabilized under acidic conditions. H*-DNA has favorable formation conditions at neutral pH and in the presence of divalent cations. This intramolecular conformation is formed from the binding of the homopurine and purine strand of the duplex in an antiparallel fashion. It is stabilized by T-A*A and C-G*G base triplets.\n\nTriple-stranded DNA has been implicated in the regulation of several genes. For instance, the c-\"myc\" gene has been extensively mutated to examine the role that triplex DNA, versus the linear sequence, plays in gene regulation. A c-\"myc\" promoter element, termed the nuclease-sensitive element or NSE, can form tandem intramolecular triplexes of the H-DNA type and has a repetitive sequence motif (ACCCTCCCC). The mutated NSE was examined for transcriptional activity and for its intra- and intermolecular triplex-forming ability. The transcriptional activity of mutant NSEs can be predicted by the element's ability to form H-DNA and not by repeat number, position, or the number of mutant base pairs. DNA may therefore be a dynamic participant in the transcription of the c-myc gene.\n\nTFOs are short (≈15-25 nt) nucleic acid strands that bind in the major groove of double-stranded DNA to form intramolecular triplex DNA structures. There is some evidence that they are also able to modulate gene activity \"in vivo\". In peptide nucleic acid (PNA), the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA is replaced with a protein-like backbone. PNAs form P-loops while interacting with duplex DNA, forming a triplex with one strand of DNA while displacing the other. Very unusual recombination or parallel triplexes, or R-DNA, have been assumed to form under RecA protein in the course of homologous recombination.\n\nTFOs bind specifically to homopurine-homopyrimidine regions that are often common in promoter and intron sequences of genes, influencing cell signaling. TFOs can inhibit transcription by binding with high specificity to the DNA helix, thereby blocking the binding and function of transcription factors for particular sequences. By introducing TFOs into a cell (through transfection or other means), the expression of certain genes can be controlled. This application has novel implications in site-specific mutagenesis and gene therapy. In human prostate cancer cells, a transcription factor Ets2 is over-expressed and thought to drive forward the growth and survival of cells in such excess. Carbone et al. designed a sequence-specific TFO to the Ets2 promoter sequence that down-regulated the gene expression and led to a slowing of cell growth and cell death. Changxian et al. have also presented a TFO targeting the promoter sequence of bcl-2, a gene inhibiting apoptosis.\n\nThe observed inhibition of transcription can also have negative health effects like its role in the recessive, autosomal gene for Friedreich’s Ataxia. In Fredrick’s Ataxia, triplex DNA formation impairs the expression of intron 1 of the FXN gene. This results in the degeneration of the nervous system and spinal cord, impairing the movement of the limbs. To combat this triplex instability, nucleotide excision repair proteins (NERs) have been shown to recognize and repair triple-stranded DNA structures, reinstating full availability of the previously inhibited and unstable gene.\n\nConsiderable research has been funneled into the biological implications relating to the presence of triplex DNA, more specifically H-DNA, in the major breakpoint regions (Mbr) and double-strand-breakpoints (DBS) of certain genes.\n\nFor example, in addition to other non-B DNA sequences found neighboring the P1 promoter of the \"c-MYC\" gene, polypurine mirror-repeat H-DNA forming sequences were found and are associated with the major breakpoint hotspots of this region. Cases of genetic instability were also observed in the F1 offspring of transgenic mice after incorporation of human H-DNA-forming sequences paired with Z-DNA sequences into their genomes where no instability was previously reported. Additionally, formation of \"R.\"R.Y. triplex conformations have been observed at the Mbr of the \"bcl-2\" gene. Formation of these structures has been posited to cause the t(14;18) translocation observed in many cancers and most follicular lymphomas. This observation has led to research that indicated a substantial decrease in translocation events can be observed after blocking the formation of H-DNA by altering the sequence of this region slightly. Long tracts of GAA·TTC have also been observed to form very stable triplex structures. Interactions between these two triplex structures, termed sticky DNA, has been shown to interrupt transcription of the \"X25\", or frataxin gene. As decreased levels of the protein frataxin is associated with Friedreich's ataxia, formation of this instability has been suggested to be the basis for this genetic disease.\n\nTriple-stranded DNA structures were common hypotheses in the 1950s when scientists were struggling to discover DNA's true structural form. Watson and Crick (who later won the Nobel Prize for their double-helix model) originally considered a triple-helix model, as did Pauling and Corey, who published a proposal for their triple-helix model in 1953, as well as fellow scientist Fraser. However, Watson and Crick soon identified several problems with these models:\nFraser's model differed from Pauling and Corey's in that in his model the phosphates are on the outside and the bases are on the inside, linked together by hydrogen bonds. However, Watson and Crick found Fraser's model to be too ill-defined to comment specifically on its inadequacies.\n\nAn alternative triple-stranded DNA structure was described in 1957. It was thought to occur in only one \"in vivo\" biological process: as an intermediate product during the action of the \"E. coli\" recombination enzyme RecA. Its role in that process is not understood.\n\n"}

It was designed by Confederate veteran William Crawford Smith and built in 1897 as part of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.\n\nToday the Parthenon, which functions as an art museum, stands as the centerpiece of Centennial Park, a large public park just west of downtown Nashville. Alan LeQuire's 1990 re-creation of the Athena Parthenos statue in the naos (the east room of the main hall) is the focus of the Parthenon just as it was in ancient Greece. Since the building is complete and its decorations were polychromed (painted in colors) as close to the presumed original as possible, this replica of the original Parthenon in Athens serves as a monument to what is considered the pinnacle of classical architecture. The plaster replicas of the Parthenon Marbles found in the Treasury Room (the west room of the main hall) are direct casts of the original sculptures which adorned the pediments of the Athenian Parthenon, dating back to 438 BC. The surviving originals are housed in the British Museum in London and at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.\n\nNashville's nickname, the \"Athens of the South\", influenced the choice of the building as the centerpiece of the 1897 Centennial Exposition. A number of buildings at the exposition were based on ancient originals. However, the Parthenon was the only one that was an exact reproduction. It was also the only one that was preserved by the city, although the Knights of Pythias Pavilion building was purchased and moved to nearby Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nMajor Eugene Castner Lewis was the director of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition and it was at his suggestion that a reproduction of the Parthenon be built in Nashville to serve as the centerpiece of Tennessee's Centennial Celebration. Lewis also served as the chief civil engineer for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad. Originally built of plaster, wood, and brick, the Parthenon was not intended to be permanent, but the cost of demolishing the structure combined with its popularity with residents and visitors alike resulted in it being left standing after the Exposition. In 1895 George Julian Zolnay was \"employed to make models for the ornamentation\" for the building. Within the next 20 years, weather had caused deterioration of the landmark; it was then rebuilt on the same foundations, in concrete, in a project that started in 1920; the exterior was completed in 1925 and the interior in 1931.\n\nSome of the most elaborate events that occurred at the Parthenon were the Spring Pageants of 1913 and 1914. These extravaganzas were theatrical productions on a massive scale. With casts of up to 500, the pageants brought in audiences from surrounding states and rail prices were lowered to encourage attendance. The entire city of Nashville reveled in the opportunity to celebrate the \"Athens of the South\". The 1913 performance was entitled \"The Fire Regained\", a play written by Sidney Mttron Hirsch, and featured a mythological story line enhanced by theatrical spectacle popular in that era. The 1914 production, \"The Mystery at Thanatos\", had a similarly mythological plot, but was shorter and better received. A copy of the script is on file at the Nashville Public Library. The most impressive thing about these pageants was the use of visual spectacle. Both shows featured impressive displays ranging from chariot races to huge dance numbers to thousands of live birds to set pieces that shot flames, all set against the backdrop of the majestic Nashville Parthenon.\n\nAs an art museum, the Parthenon's permanent collection on the lower level is a group of 63 paintings by 19th and 20th century American artists, donated by James M. Cowan. Additional gallery spaces provide a venue for a variety of temporary shows and exhibits. The main level contains a replica, completed in 1990, of the Athena Parthenos statue that was in the original Parthenon in Athens.\n\nThe statue of Athena Parthenos is a reconstruction, to careful scholarly standards, of the long-lost original: she is cuirassed and helmeted, carries a shield on her left arm and a small 6-foot-high (1.8 m) statue of Nike (Victory) in her right palm, and stands 42 feet (13 m) high, gilt with more than 8 pounds (3.6 kg) of gold leaf; an equally colossal serpent rears its head between her and her shield.\n\nIn the summertime, local theater productions use the building as a backdrop for classic Greek plays such as Euripides' \"Medea\" and Sophocles' \"Antigone\", performing (usually for free) on the steps of the Parthenon. Other performances, such as Mary Zimmerman's \"Metamorphoses\", have been done inside, at the foot of Athena's statue.\n\nThe Parthenon got a full makeover in 2002 with a much needed cleaning and restoration of the exterior. The exterior lighting was upgraded to allow the columns of the building to be illuminated with different colors than the facade, allowing a uniquely versatile display of effects for events.\n\nThe Parthenon served as the location for the political rally in the climactic scene of Robert Altman's 1975 film \"Nashville\". It was also used as a backdrop for the battle against the Hydra in the 2010 film \"\". It features in the title and lyrics of the song \"Nashville Parthenon\" from the album \"Etiquette\", by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. It was used in the 2000 PBS series \"Greeks: Crucible of Civilization\". A poem titled \"Ganymede\" in Heather Ross Miller's \"Celestial Navigator: Writing Poems with Randall Jarrell\" features the Parthenon. The structure also figures in the climax of the Hector Lassiter novel, \"Three Chords and The Truth\", by Craig McDonald.\n\n"}

Woods and MacKillop also established in Penola a congregation of religious sisters, the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. Otherwise known as the 'Josephites' or 'Brown Joeys', they continue to work with the poor and needy communities throughout the world today.\n\nPenola was on the Mount Gambier to Wolseley railway line which opened in 1887 until its closure to freight on 12 April 1995 and then to Limestone Coast Railway tourist passengers on 1 July 2006.\n\nThe first Europeans to the area were the Austin brothers who arrived in 1840 and established a run of 109 square miles (282 km²). The first settlers were Scottish-born Alexander Cameron and his wife Margaret in January 1844 after obtaining an occupation licence. In April 1850, Cameron obtained 80 acres (0.3 km²) of freehold land (his station was on a pastoral lease) and established the private town of Panoola, later known as Penola.\n\nBy 1850, he had built the Royal Oak Hotel and was doing much business supplying liquor to the many travelers passing through to the Victoria goldfields. \nPenola Post Office opened around 1852.\n\nJohn Riddoch purchased Yallum in 1861. Riddoch grew up in poverty in the highlands of Scotland and in 1851 emigrated to try his luck on the Victoria goldfields. Within a few years he was a successful shopkeeper and wine merchant on the Geelong goldfields. He acquired 35,000 acres (142 km²) on which he ran 50,000 head of sheep.\n\nIt was Riddoch who planted the first grape vines and helped to diversify the pastoral economy of the area with an agricultural industry. In 1890, he established the Penola Fruit Growing Colony which was renamed Coonawarra in 1897.\n\nIn 2010, a strong tornado ripped through the township destroying at least four buildings and damaging many more.\n\nPenola has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n\nThe Mary MacKillop Interpretive Centre is located in Penola. It is in close proximity to the two State Heritage sites of Petticoat Lane and the original stone schoolhouse developed by Mary MacKillop in conjunction with Father Julian Tenison Woods in the 1800s.\n\nPenola is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of MacKillop, and the local government area of the Wattle Range Council.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Kowree-Naracoorte-Tatiara Football League.\n\nThe primary local newspaper of the district is \"The Pennant\", published weekly since July 1946, while \"The Border Watch\" (also part of the Scott Group of Companies) and rival \"The Naracoorte Herald,\" also publish local and regional news.\n\nPenola has been home to some notable and interesting people. Among them Saint Mary MacKillop, poets John Shaw Neilson and Adam Lindsay Gordon, Father J.T. Woods, Scottish-Australian bush poet Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963), Sara Douglass, Michael Graham (footballer) and John Riddoch.\n\nIt was \"The Border Watch\" that published Ogilvie's first poem in Australia on 22 April 1893, when he was at nearby Maaoupe Station.\n\nThe Antarctic explorer John Riddoch Rymill was born in Penola, named his ship \"Penola\" and later successfully farmed the Old Penola Estate.\n\n\n"}

He was alleged in the first wave of McCarthyism to have provided a Soviet spy with information during the 1940s, but was never charged with espionage. \nGreenberg was born \"Michael Menahem Greenberg\" in Manchester, Lancashire, England, son of a Polish-born father and a mother from Iași, Romania, both of whom had arrived in the UK as children in the 1890s. He attended Manchester Grammar School and won a scholarship to study history at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours.\n\nGreenberg arrived in the United States in 1939 to attend the Graduate School of Harvard University under a Joseph Hodges Choate Memorial Fellowship from Trinity College. He studied at Harvard from October 1939 to January 1941. Greenberg also became Managing Editor of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) publication, \"Pacific Affairs\" in 1941. In August 1941, Edward Clark Carter, General Secretary to the Pacific Council of the IPR, wrote Lauchlin Currie asking if letters to Owen Lattimore in China could be transmitted so that \"they are not read by others before reaching him.\" Currie promptly replied on a White House letterhead that \"I will be glad to get the letters you mentioned to Lattimore uncensored.\" Currie's assistant in the White House was Greenberg.\n\nIn 1942 Greenberg became a China specialist at the Board of Economic Warfare and an assistant to the agency's head, Lauchlin Currie. Greenberg later worked as a Foreign Affairs Economist in the Administrative Division, Enemy Branch, of the Foreign Economic Administration. Elizabeth Bentley, who had never met Greenberg (see Silvermaster file 2C page 18) stated that for a brief period Greenberg supplied information concerning principally China. Unspecified information was alleged to have been passed through Mary Price.\n\nCivil Service Commission security officials wanted Greenberg dismissed upon learning of an alleged involvement with the Communist Party (see Silvermaster file 2C page 18). Louis Budenz and an academic Karl Wittfogel who met Greenberg in Cambridge and stated that he \"must have\" been a Communist because of his associates. Upon appeal, the Civil Service Commission was over-ruled. Greenberg became a U.S. citizen in 1944 and transferred to the Department of State in 1945, resigning in 1946. Greenberg left the United States permanently in 1947 after being interviewed by the FBI so was never called before a Congressional Committee.\n\nGreenberg's FBI file is highly redacted. A wiretap in 1945 revealed Greenbergs's co-workers discussing \"the charges against him\", and remarking that Greenberg would have been better off if he had worked, but that he had never turned out a piece of work in the three years he had been employed by the government. His FBI file concluded: \"Investigations conducted thus far has failed to disclose any pertinent information to this case at this time\" Silvermaster file 2C page 50.\n\nUpon return to England, Greenberg went back to Cambridge and completed work on his Ph.D. thesis, which was eventually published as a book \"British Trade and the Opening of China\" () (1947, Cambridge University Press, reissued in 1970, republished in the US in 1979, and again in 2000 as part of an 8 volume set \"China Trade : British Commerce and the Opening of China, 1635–1842\"). This book, based on the then recently released archives of the Jardine Matheson Company, a major player in the development of Hong Kong, describes the forceful exploitation of China by British colonial power in establishing and maintaining the colony of Hong Kong (see also Opium War).\n\nBlocked from academic promotion, most likely due to his left-leaning politics, he went on to work in a number of jobs in journalism, public relations, advertising and film criticism in England, Switzerland and France. He lost his U.S. citizenship due to absence from the US and was denied a passport by the British Home Office, even as late as the 1970s. His British passport was never restored to him, and the accusations continued to hound him throughout the 1950s.\n\nIn 1958, he was recruited as Economic Advisor to the Central Bank of Ceylon, returning to the UK in 1960. Shortly thereafter, he became, as Michael Green, assistant editor and then chief editor of \"The Banker\", a monthly professional journal published by the Financial Times of London. He later became Chief Economist at the London stockbroking company De Zoete & Bevan. He commented that in the City of London most people shared the Marxist analysis of capitalism that he had learned in Cambridge in the 1930s, but that they were, by contrast, quite content with the implicit inequalities.\n\nHis obituary appeared in \"The Times\" and \"The Independent\".

His ancestral hometown is Kaizhou (開州; present-day Fengcheng, Liaoning). He is nicknamed \"Fiery Thunderbolt\" because of his thunderous voice and fiery temper, which make him a fearsome warrior. His weapon is a sort of spiked club commonly known as \"wolf's teeth mace\" ().\n\nWhen Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou, learns that Hua Rong, the garrison commander of Qingfeng Fort (清風寨; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong), which is part of his jurisdiction, has joined the outlaws on nearby Mount Qingfeng (), he orders Qin Ming to lead a force to eliminate them.\n\nQin Ming engages Hua Rong in a one-on-one combat on horseback but neither wins. Hua Rong then feigns defeat and flees. Taunting Qin knowing that he easily loses his cool, Hua lures the latter to gallop round the hill. Finally, madly enraged and tired, Qin falls into a dug pit. He is taken to Song Jiang, who unties him and tries to win him over. Although Qin Ming turns down Song's plea, he agrees to rest overnight at Mount Qingfeng.\n\nThe following day, when Qin Ming returns to Qingzhou, he finds the suburb razed, with the residents killed and the houses burnt down.

Song discloses that the pillage was their work during the night when he was asleep at the stronghold. Qin is extremely angry but controls his rage seeing that he is outnumbered. He is finally placated when Song Jiang gives Hua Rong's younger sister to him as wife to \"compensate\" his loss.\n\nQin Ming then goes to Qingfeng Fort, where he convinces Huang Xin, his martial arts student, to join the outlaws as well. Huang Xin lets in the outlaws, who slaughter the family of the fort's governor Liu Gao, including Liu‘s wife whose unwarranted accusation of Song Jiang triggered the frictions and the military clash. Taking Song Jiang's proposal, the outlaws abandon Mount Qingfeng to join the Liangshan Marsh.\n\nLater during Liangshan's battle at Qingzhou, Qin Ming avenges the killing of his family.

K. Milholland, is an American webcomic author. His works include \"Something Positive\", \"New Gold Dreams\", \"Midnight Macabre\", \"Classically Positive\" and \"Super Stupor\".\n\nRaised in Bedford, Texas, Milholland attended Harwood Junior High and Trinity High School in neighboring Euless, Texas. During high school he won several awards for his editorial cartoons. He went on to enroll in the art department at the University of North Texas where he spent four years.\n\nMilholland moved to Boston in the spring of 1999. He worked odd jobs, including stints at a dot com startup, scientific non-profit, medical billing and medical research companies. During this time he started the \"Something Positive\" webcomic, in response to a criticism from his friend, voice actress Clarine Harp, that he should \"do something positive\" with his life. The protagonist in this comic, Davan, is loosely based on Milholland and the stories are often inspired by real life experiences. Davan's best friend Aubrey Chorde is based on Harp.\n\nIn June 2004, faced with increasing complaints about his lateness in updating the comic, Milholland challenged his readership to donate enough money to pay for a year of his salary, so that he could quit his job and become a full-time cartoonist. To his surprise, this amount was reached and surpassed in less than a month, making Milholland one of the successful pioneers of micropatronage. Since then, his webcomic has expanded into many realms of merchandising.\n\nMilholland has relocated to Texas and travels the con circuit frequently. He also sometimes performs in community theater, especially children's theater. In 2017, he moved to Georgia.\n\n\"Something Positive\" started its run on December 19, 2001. , it is still being actively updated.\n\nStarting on September 7, 2007, Milholland launched a third spin-off from \"Something Positive,\" this one also taking place in the same continuity as the original but taking place many years earlier. \"Something Positive 1937\" follows the relationship of Fred's father Vester Macintire and his cousin Davan (Davan of \"S*P\"'s namesake, first mentioned in the comic's May 8, 2007 strip). The comic is in black and white and for a time featured in a sidebar next to the original, with archives available on the same page as the original strip. Milholland has said in news posts he expects the story to last for a few years, and provided it with its own website on September 24, 2007. The strip stopped updating in 2008.\n\n\"Midnight Macabre\" is another spin-off from \"Something Positive\". It features Gaspar Baugh, the father of \"Something Positive\" secondary character Lisa Baugh, as he attempts to resurrect a horror TV show presenting Midnight movies.\n\n\"New Gold Dreams\" is a strip that spoofs the conventions of the heroic fantasy genre. It also ties in with Milholland's interest in role-playing games, as the comic is portrayed as a game run by Pee-Jee, one of the main strip's cast members; some of the characters in \"New Gold Dreams\" have the same appearance and personality as regular \"S*P\" characters. The comic started on April 2, 2004 but has been entirely on hiatus since the 20th issue in August 2005.\n\n\"Super Stupor\" is a superhero comic, which mocks the conventions of the genre.

Following the Crusades, production of this soap extended to the whole Mediterranean area.\n\nIn the 17th century, the soap caused controversy in England, since it supplanted the unnamed local soap after the Spanish Catholic manufacturers purchased the monopoly on soap from the cash-strapped Carolinian government. Its ties to Catholicism caused a public-relations campaign to be established, featuring washerwomen showing how much more effective local soaps were than Castile soap. The sale of a monopoly in Protestant England to a Catholic company caused great uproar, ending with the Castile soap company eventually being stripped of the monopoly.\n\nEarly soap-makers in England did not have easy access to laurel oil and therefore dropped it from their formulations, thereby creating an olive-oil soap now known as Castile soap.\n\nImportations of \"Castile soap\" through Antwerp appear in the London port books of 1567–1568, though the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has no references to \"Castile soap\" earlier than 1616. In his article \"A short history of soap\", John Hunt maintains that \"barilla\" (an impure form of sodium carbonate obtained from halophyte plant ashes that were high in sodium) was boiled with locally available olive oil, rather than tallow.\n\nAdding brine to the boiled liquor made the soap float to the surface, where the soap-boiler could skim it off, leaving the excess lye and impurities to settle out. While Aleppo soap tends to be green, this produced what was probably the first white hard soap, which hardened further as it aged, without losing its whiteness, forming \"jabón de Castilla\".\n\nApothecaries knew the product by the Latin names of \"sapo hispaniensis\" (Spanish soap) or of \"sapo castilliensis\" (Castilian soap).\n\n\n"}

Elected at the 2004 federal election, she was a Labor member of the Australian Senate from July 2005, representing the state of South Australia. She announced in July 2010 that she would not re-contest her seat at the following federal election and her six-year term ended on 30 June 2011.\n\nHurley was educated at the University of Adelaide, where she graduated in science. Before entering federal politics, she was member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the safe Labor seat of Napier in Adelaide's northern suburbs from 1993 to 2002, and was Deputy Leader of the Opposition 1997–2002. At the 2002 South Australian state election, she decided to stand in Light, a previously safe Liberal seat that had been made marginal in a redistribution. Hurley lost narrowly to Liberal incumbent Malcolm Buckby. At that election, Labor fell one seat short of a majority. Had Hurley won Light, she would have delivered her party majority government and become South Australia's first female Deputy Premier.\n\nIn June 2005, before even taking her seat in the Senate, Hurley was elected to the Opposition front bench and appointed Shadow Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. She lost her front bench position in December 2006, after a shadow cabinet reshuffle instigated by new Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd due to criticism of her fast promotion to the frontbench despite the fact that she had been deputy leader of the SA branch of the ALP.\n\nHer promotion to the federal frontbench was a reward for taking the political risks which saw the end of her career in the South Australian Parliament and stopped her from becoming the state's Deputy Premier rather than the misperception that it was solely because of a factional arrangement.\n\n"}

Poliespo was an attempt to combine these 'lightning words' into one language. Most of Poliespo comes from Cherokee, English, Esperanto, and Spanish, the languages that Nvwtohiyada could speak.\n\nThe philosophy behind the language is reminiscent of sound symbolism or phonosemantics, and therefore radically differs from the principles of Esperanto.\n\nAlphabet: a, â, ⱥ, ⱥ̂, b, b̆, c, ĉ, d, e, ê, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, ĭ, ĭ:, ĭ́, î, î:, î́, j, ĵ, k, k̆, l, m, m̆, n, n̆, o, ô, p, pʷ (actually, an overstruck ʷ), s, ŝ, t, t̂, ť, u, û, ŭ, v, z, ẑ, z̆, q, q́, q̂, q̂́, w, ẃ, ŵ, ŵ́, x, x́, y, 2, 2́. \n\nFinding information about the Poliespo language as a whole is difficult, and most of the information is poorly explained. However, the consonant phonology is possibly as follows:\n\nẐ is [kts], z̆ is [gdz].\n\nThe vowel phonology is possibly as follows:\n\nEach of these vowels has a nasal equivalent. It is unknown how /ĩ/ is marked, and /ə̃/ is written with the number 2, because Waldon believed that the number 2 resembled a nose.The remainder of the nasal vowels are written using a circumflex accent. Poliespo is a tonal language, containing three or four tones. Acute accents mark a rising tone, however, nothing is known about the other tones.\n\nThe structure is more similar to Ido than to Esperanto, since radicals are inflected (it is a polysynthetic language); therefore, the language is not perfectly agglutinative. Unlike Ido, it has only one prefix in addition to those of Esperanto: pe-, which is used to indicate the \"neutral\" gender. Besides the accusative, there is also a subject suffix, as in Korean and Japanese.\n\nThe suggested goal is to give the western U.S. and native people the opportunity to acquire the \"Cherokee Spirit\". According to its speakers, one cannot speak Poliespo well unless one speaks Esperanto. In fact, repeating yourself in Esperanto (in this context, known as Zaespo) if you aren't understood in Poliespo (or, as it is referred to in this context, Idpo), is considered speaking Poliespo. \n\n"}

When \"Shōnen Captain\" was discontinued in 1997, the manga was picked up by Kadokawa Shoten who subsequently re-released all of the previous tankōbon originally published by Tokuma. The manga is currently serialized in Kadokawa's \"Young Ace\" magazine. It has been licensed by Viz Media, Star Comics and Chuang Yi Publishing.\n\nGuyver has been adapted into a single OVA titled \"\" (1986, based loosely on the first volume), a (1989 to 1992, based on the first four volumes), two live action movies (1991's \"The Guyver\" and 1994's \"\") as well as a (2005 to 2006, based on the first ten volumes).\n\nA test type Zoanoid escapes from the Cronos Corporation with three Guyver Units. Cronos soldiers pursue the test type into some woods to recover the units from him, but when they corner the test type, he detonates a bomb he had with him. The Guyver Units are scattered in the blast. One of the lost Guyver Units, known as \"Unit I\", lands near two young high school students, Shō Fukamachi and Tetsurō Segawa. The second one is retrieved by Cronos and merges with Oswald A. Lisker to become the second Guyver later on. The final unit falls into the hands of Agito Makishima, who merges with it at an unspecified time. Shō accidentally activates the unit which then painfully merges with him.\n\nOver time, Shō learns more about the Guyver and its abilities. The Guyver is virtually invulnerable, with its only weak point being the Control Metal. With this part intact, it can rebuild the host from their data it stores within, but if this part is critically damaged, however, the host will be eaten alive by the unit and perish. This is disconcerting and Shō starts to question whether he will ever be free from the Guyver. The situation gets worse with the fact that Cronos is continuously sending more and more powerful Zoanoids to retrieve the Guyver. This makes it increasingly difficult for Shō to protect his vulnerable friends.\n\nAs the story progresses it also takes a startling turn, in which Cronos succeeds in taking over the world and reshaping it according to its ideals. The Guyvers are then labeled to the public as a \"vanguard of alien invaders\".\n\n\n\n\"Guyver: Out of Control\" is a 1986 short horror original video animation based on the manga. It was produced in Japan by Bandai, Studio Live, Network, Animate and Movic and in association with AIC, Artland, Studio Victory, Wave and Only For A Lite. It was released in the U.S. and Canada in 1993 by L.A. Hero under the Dark Image Entertainment label. It has since been out of print in North America. The story follows high school students Shō Fukamachi and Mizuki Segawa who accidentally discover one of three Bio Booster Armor units stolen from the Chronos Corporation. When Shō and Mizuki are attacked by a Zoanoid, the unit comes into contact with Shō and bonds with him, transforming him into Guyver I and promptly destroying the Zoanoid assailant. Meanwhile, a female Chronos agent named Valcuria acquires a second unit and becomes Guyver II. She then abducts Mizuki in order to challenge Shō for the Guyver I unit. On Anime News Network, Justin Sevakis called it an \"extremely dated piece of pulp that still somehow manages to be fun\".\n"}

Nicknamed \"Gold Lancer\", he ranks 18th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Xu Ning as six \"chi\" tall, having a fair face with a thin dark beard and ample at the waistline. He is an expert in using the hooked lance, a Chinese spear with a hook attached next to the tip. He serves as the instructor of the Gold Lancers Unit of the imperial army in Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), the imperial capital of the Song Empire. \n\nThe Song Court orders Huyan Zhuo to lead an army to stamp out the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh. The general deploys a special cavalry, whose horses are linked in groups by chains and covered with armour. As the horses charge forward, their consolidated might overwhelms the Liangshan forces. Song Jiang has to hole up in the stronghold to find a way to counter the cavalry. Tang Long suggests recruiting his cousin Xu Ning, whose skillful manoeuvring of the hooked lance could fell the cavalry. Song Jiang sends Tang Long, Dai Zong, Shi Qian and Yue He to lure Xu Ning to Liangshan.\n\nShi Qian sneaks into Xu Ning's house after nightfall and steals a precious family heirloom of his – a golden armour vest that no object can pierce.

{"id": "2060506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060506", "title": "Arrival (The Prisoner)", "text": "Arrival (The Prisoner)\n\n\"Arrival\" is the first episode of the allegorical British science fiction TV series, \"The Prisoner\". It was written by George Markstein and David Tomblin and directed by Don Chaffey. It was first broadcast in the UK on ITV (ATV Midlands and Grampian) on Friday 29 September 1967 and first aired in the United States on CBS on Saturday 1 June 1968.\n\nThe episode introduced the character of Number Six, portrayed by co-creator Patrick McGoohan and introduced Guy Doleman and George Baker as Number Two, the regularly changing administrator of The Village in which Number Six was incarcerated.\n\nThe episode introduced most of the concepts of the series present throughout its run, as Number Two used various means to find out why Number Six had abruptly resigned from his intelligence job.\n\nAn unidentified British intelligence agent storms into his employer's London office to hand in his resignation. He returns home in his Lotus Seven and hastily packs a bag to go on travel, unaware that a hearse has followed him home. The hearse driver releases knockout gas into the man's home via the keyhole. The man collapses in his study. Later, the man wakes up in what appears to be his study, but finds it is a mockup located in \"The Village\". He asks the colorfully-clad residents of the Village what country he is in, but they cannot provide a satisfactory answer. He discovers the Village is surrounded by mountains save for its beachline that opens onto the ocean with no sign of land nearby. Frustrated, he returns to the mockup study to find it is attached to a modern flat. There, he receives a phone call and is told that Number Two wants to meet him at the Green Dome.\n\nAt the Green Dome, where several technicians monitor all aspects of the Village, Number Two tells the man they only wish to know why he resigned and to whom he is loyal, as the intelligence he has gathered over his career is too valuable to simply let him \"walk away\". Number Two suggests they would rather have his cooperation, but are prepared to use other means as needed. Number Two takes the man on a tour of the Village to show him the security systems they have in place to keep the inhabitants in line, including Rover, a mysterious floating balloon guardian that attacks those who flee. Later that night, the man attempts escape by sea but Rover catches him and renders him unconscious.\n\nThe man wakes in the Village's hospital, and finds a former colleague, Cobb, in the next bed. The man learns Cobb is also incarcerated in the Village, but before he can learn more, the hospital staff take him away for examination. On his return, he is told Cobb committed suicide by jumping out of the window. The man is released, and goes to accost Number Two, but finds that a different man is in the Green Dome. The new Number Two explains they may change that position from time to time for unexplained reasons. He then explains that no one in the Village uses their names, but are instead assigned a number, and the man is now Number Six. Number Six refuses to use this title as he adjusts to life in the Village.\n\nNumber Six attends Cobb's funeral and observes a woman watching from afar, and proceeds to follow her around the Village before he talks to her directly. The woman, Number Nine, claims to have been working with Cobb on an escape plan, and suggests that Number Six can still use the same plan. She gives him an electropass that can keep Rover at bay, giving him time to escape via a helicopter. Number Six has doubts about her motives as he had seen her talking to Number Two, but accepts the pass. That night, Number Six uses the pass and acquires a helicopter, but as he flies off, one of the technicians remotely takes over the helicopter and returns it to the Village. Number Six is escorted back to his home in the Village. Number Two is watching these events with Cobb, who had faked his death to mislead Number Six. With his assignment complete, Cobb prepares to move on to his next duty, but warns Number Two that Number Six will be \"a tough nut to crack\".\n\nThe first draft script by George Markstein was completed in the Spring of 1966. David Tomblin then assisted Markstein and they prepared a script that Patrick McGoohan then further adapted. In late June 1966 a shooting script had been finalised (now called \"The Arrival\"). Principal locating filming began in Portmeirion on 5 September 1966, with Don Chaffey the director.\n\nFurther scenes were shot on 6 September, but Guy Doleman (playing Number Two) was suffering from cracked ribs and his presence only lasted two days. The plan was to complete shooting at Portmeirion by 9 September but filming was to overran by several days. The aerial shots from the helicopter were filmed between 14 and 16 September. A body double was used for the now absent Guy Doleman. Chaffey was still filming exterior shots for the episode on 18 September. On 30 September, the last day of shooting at Portmeirion, McGoohan directed a number of shots including Rover's attack on a Villager in the main piazza.\n\nDuring the shooting in September it was realised that the initial idea for the guardian 'Rover' was unworkable. Initially the device was intended as a black-and-white domed contraption with a blue light on top. Inside was a go-kart and room enough for a man to steer. It quickly became evident that the contraption was unsteerable on Portmeirion's cobbled streets. A version that would act on water simply sank. Whose idea it was to use weather balloons is contested but it would appear someone saw them being used over the estuary and decided they could be used as 'Rover'.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of October 1966, the interior scenes were shot at the MGM-British Studios. All of guest stars George Baker (new Number Two) and Paul Eddington (Cobb) were shot in this period. A key set was redressed as Number Two's living quarters, the Control Room and the Labour Exchange. Other shots showed the General Store and the interior of Number Six's cottage.\n\nEditing of \"Arrival\" began immediately after the interior shots were completed. Lee Doig has a rough cut of the episode prepared by the end of December 1966. Geoff Foot also finished the opening sequence for the episode - this longer version was only used to introduce this episode. The initial cut was some 90 minutes long and numerous cuts had to be made to bring down to the required 48 minutes for transmission.\n\nRobert Farnon composed the first score and cues for the episode on 20 December 1966. Farnon's score and theme tune was rejected, and Wilfred Josephs was commissioned to write another in early January 1967.\n\nThe first edit of the episode appeared in February 1967 but by March much of Josephs' score had been removed. Ron Grainer was asked to create a theme tune and his was later used on all episodes, a longer version prepared for the extended opening sequence in \"Arrival\". Additional incidental music cues created by Albert Elms.\n\nDuring the production of the last four episodes of \"The Prisoner\" series (the episode \"Living in Harmony\" was being made) ITC arranged for a press conference to take place at MGM-British studios in Borehamwood on 20 September 1967 - a week before the scheduled transmission on some British TV channels. At the press coverage Patrick McGoohan (at the start wearing his \"kosho\" uniform, a made up martial art used in the series) was interviewed inside the cage shown in the episode \"Once Upon a Time\". Also present was Angelo Muscat, the mute butler seen in most episodes and Alexis Kanner. Two episodes - \"Arrival\" and \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" - were played to the press. Both episodes had different title sequences at start and finish to that eventually broadcast, as well as with different theme music (by Albert Elms rather than Ron Grainer) and different edits of scenes including different shots and extra dialogue. The alternative version of \"Arrival\" was released by the Network imprint on DVD in the UK in 2003. A 2007 DVD release included an improved-quality version, digitally remastered from a faded 35mm print, which can be also viewed with a music only soundtrack.\n\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. The episode was first shown at 7:30pm on Friday 29 September 1967 on ATV Midlands and Grampian Television, on Sunday 1 October on ATV London, Southern Television, Westward Television and Tyne-Tees; on Thursday 5 October on Scottish Television, on Friday 6 October on Anglia Television, on Thursday 19 October on Border Television and on Friday 27 October on Granada Television in the North West. The aggregate viewing figures for the ITV regions that debuted the season in 1967 have been estimated at 11.0 million. In Northern Ireland, the episode did not debut until Saturday 6 January 1968, and in Wales, the episode was not broadcast until Wednesday 7 January 1970.\n\nRover, the white balloon guardian, made its first appearance in this episode but was not identified by this name on-screen until the later episode \"The Schizoid Man\".\n\n"}

Gravity was prominently featured in the \"Fear Itself\" tie-in series \"Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt\" #1-6 (2011).\n\nGreg Willis was born and raised in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. During the summer after his high school graduation, while on board his family's yacht, Greg is sucked into a mysterious black hole. He is found hours later by his parents, unharmed. After the incident, Greg finds that he is able to manipulate the gravitational force around his body and nearby objects. Looking to take advantage of his new powers, Greg moves east to New York City to study licensing and merchandising at New York University, and becomes a marketable member of the superhero community known as Gravity.\n\nOn his first outing, Gravity encounters a battle between Rage and Black Death. Unfortunately, Gravity accidentally mistakes Rage as a villain and allows Black Death to escape. His confidence begins to waver as life as a superhero proves tougher than he expects. But after he saves the life of a frail old woman, and meets new friends Lauren Singh and Frog, Gravity slowly becomes more confident in his double identity. His later battles prove to be more fruitful, defeating the likes of Rhino, Shocker, and Whirlwind. However, Black Death takes a special interest in Gravity, appearing numerous times to humiliate the new hero. Black Death then masquerades as a hero known as the Greenwich Guardian (Black Death's identity before becoming a supervillain) to further break Gravity's confidence and use him in a plot to destroy the university. Ultimately, his resolve is too strong for Black Death and the villain is defeated. After the battle, Gravity is congratulated by Spider-Man, filling him with confidence. Finally feeling accepted, Gravity begins a relationship with his friend Lauren and continues his superhero career. Gravity later revealed his double identity to Lauren.\n\nAfter defeating a villain called Brushfire, Gravity stumbles upon a mysterious structure in Central Park and is transported to an alien world where he meets Spider-Man, Henry Pym, the Wasp, Venom, Kraven, Firebird, and the Hood. A mysterious voice claiming to be the Beyonder explains to the gathered heroes and villains that they must slay their enemies to win their reward. During their attempts to survive the hostile alien world, the group meet Michael Collins, who helps them survive and come to the realization that the Beyonder has seemingly brought them together to evaluate them and see who wins in a battle amongst themselves. Eventually, the group battles one another, and Henry Pym emerges as the victor when he seemingly kills the other heroes and villains. He then deceives the Beyonder into revealing his true identity as the Stranger, and restores the rest of the group, who have been shrunk down using Pym Particles. An angered Stranger is about to destroy the group until Uatu appears. The presence of a Watcher unnerves the Stranger, who then allows the group to leave peacefully, and disappears. Without the Stranger's power, the planet begins to pull itself apart. Gravity uses his powers to hold the planet together and allows the rest of the group to escape. He uses the last of his power to join the group on the spaceship, but dies shortly afterwards. The remaining heroes and villains attend Gravity's funeral to pay their respects for his actions. Later, Uatu stands by Gravity's grave, waiting to witness a cosmic destiny.\n\nWhen Gravity's grave is desecrated and his body is stolen, Michael Collins enlists the help of the new Fantastic Four (now consisting of Black Panther and Storm as well as the Human Torch and the Thing) to find his fallen comrade. Following a cosmic residue left behind at the graveyard, the team ventures into deep space to discover that Gravity's body has been stolen and resurrected by Epoch as the new Protector of the Universe. To protect Epoch from being consumed, Gravity empties his new cosmic-level powers into Galactus and returns to Earth to see his parents and Lauren once more. Later, when the Fantastic Four are fighting alongside Doctor Strange and the Silver Surfer to save Eternity from death, Uatu seeks out Gravity's help to act as a \"scalpel\" to cut out the infected portions of the universe, fulfilling his cosmic destiny. Uatu informs Gravity that his secret identity (revealed after his demise) has been magically restored.\n\nGravity later joins the Fifty State Initiative. After passing a leadership course, Gravity is made the leader of Nevada's Initiative team, the Heavy Hitters, where he is joined by Initiative graduates Hardball, Nonstop, and Telemetry.\n\nThe Heavy Hitters are one of the few teams not to be infiltrated by the Skrulls during their secret invasion of Earth. Gravity and the Heavy Hitters aid the rest of the Initiative to battle and defeat Skrulls posing as the Revolutionary, Equinox, Thor Girl and Great Lakes Avengers member Grasshopper. During the battle with the Skrull Grasshopper, Flatman invites Gravity to join his home-state team, which he quickly rejects. The surviving members of the Initiative (including Gravity) storm Camp Hammond and retake it from the Skrulls. When Hardball confesses to Komodo that he has been forced to become a HYDRA double agent, Komodo enlists Gravity and the rest of the Heavy Hitters to help free him. However, the plan backfires when Hardball feels betrayed by Komodo and his team. He forcibly quits the Initiative and joins HYDRA, swearing enmity to his former friends. After the Skrulls' secret invasion, when Norman Osborn gains control of the Initiative, Gravity is replaced as the leader of the Heavy Hitters with Prodigy. Gravity was transferred to Wisconsin as leader of the Great Lakes Avengers, much to his dismay.\n\nWith the fall of Osborn's Initiative, and the abolishment of the Superhuman Registration Act, Gravity quits the Great Lakes Avengers and considers giving up his position as a hero. While flying back to see his parents, Gravity attempts to save a young couple from a mysterious explosion. However, before he can get them to safety, the couple are killed by Warhead, a member of the anarchist terrorist group known as the Bastards of Evil. In retaliation, Gravity angrily beats the villain unconscious, and finds renewed reason to continue to be a hero.\n\nReturning to his studies at New York University, Gravity finds himself with his friends Lauren and Frog once more. The return of Warhead and the Bastards of Evil, an anarchist group claiming to be the estranged children of supervillains, brings Gravity together with fellow hero and university student Firestar. However, their team-up isn't enough to stop Warhead from detonating his powers, killing himself and many others around him at Ground Zero. Becoming obsessed, Gravity struggles to keep up with his double life. He manages to see the errors of his ways with the help of Frog and Firestar respectively. Later, Gravity and Firestar team up with Nomad, Spider-Girl, and Toro to defeat Superior, the son of the Leader, the creator of the Bastards of Evil. Teaming-up with the Secret Avengers, Gravity and his new young allies fight the entity known as Onslaught, where he was forced to kill Nomad, who was revealed to be just a construct made by Onslaught himself so he could use the energy he had stored in her as an anchor to pull himself back into Earth-616, so that Onslaught could not return and destroy Earth.\n\nWhen Steve Rogers requests that Prodigy create a new Initiative of volunteers to combat the growing fear within the nation, Gravity is among the former Initiative members that answer the call. Accompanied by Firestar, Gravity is appointed as co-team leader of one of the sections. His former Heavy Hitters teammate Hardball, recognised as a hero once again due to his role in Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.'s downfall, taunts Gravity for his lack of leadership skills. When Hardball causes an explosion during a battle with Juggernaut, who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Gravity confronts him, blaming him for his carelessness. Komodo and Firestar quickly break it up. They later battle Thor Girl, when she regains her designate powers.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Island\" storyline, the Young Allies are seen defending New York. On the Hudson River bridge, Gravity fights against the Spider-King. Venom arrived and fought the Spider-King, spotting Gravity and threw him in the air.

{"id": "2060539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060539", "title": "T-cell receptor", "text": "T-cell receptor\n\nThe T-cell receptor (TCR) is a protein complex found on the surface of T cells, or T lymphocytes, that is responsible for recognizing fragments of antigen as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The binding between TCR and antigen peptides is of relatively low affinity and is degenerate: that is, many TCRs recognize the same antigen peptide and many antigen peptides are recognized by the same TCR.\n\nThe TCR is composed of two different protein chains (that is, it is a hetero dimer). In humans, in 95% of T cells the TCR consists of an alpha (α) chain and a beta (β) chain (encoded by \"TRA\" and \"TRB\", respectively), whereas in 5% of T cells the TCR consists of gamma and delta (γ/δ) chains (encoded by \"TRG\" and \"TRD\", respectively). This ratio changes during ontogeny and in diseased states (such as leukemia). It also differs between species. Orthologues of the 4 loci have been mapped in various species. Each locus can produce a variety of polypeptides with constant and variable regions.\n\nWhen the TCR engages with antigenic peptide and MHC (peptide/MHC), the T lymphocyte is activated through signal transduction, that is, a series of biochemical events mediated by associated enzymes, co-receptors, specialized adaptor molecules, and activated or released transcription factors. Based on the initial receptor triggering mechanism, the TCR belongs to the family of Non-catalytic tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors (NTRs).\n\nIn 1982, Nobel laureat James P. Allison first discovered the T-cell receptor. Then, Tak Wah Mak and Mark M. Davis identified the cDNA clones encoding the human and mouse TCR respectively in 1984. These findings allowed the entity and structure of the elusive TCR, known before as the \"Holy Grail of Immunology\", to be revealed. This allowed scientists from around the world to carry out studies on the TCR, leading to important studies in the fields of CAR-T, cancer immunotherapy and checkpoint inhibition.\n\nThe TCR is a disulfide-linked membrane-anchored heterodimeric protein normally consisting of the highly variable alpha (α) and beta (β) chains expressed as part of a complex with the invariant CD3 chain molecules. T cells expressing this receptor are referred to as α:β (or αβ) T cells, though a minority of T cells express an alternate receptor, formed by variable gamma (γ) and delta (δ) chains, referred as γδ T cells.\n\nEach chain is composed of two extracellular domains: Variable (V) region and a Constant (C) region, both of Immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain forming antiparallel β-sheets. The Constant region is proximal to the cell membrane, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail, while the Variable region binds to the peptide/MHC complex.\n\nThe variable domain of both the TCR α-chain and β-chain each have three hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). There is also an additional area of hypervariability on the β-chain (HV4) that does not normally contact antigen and, therefore, is not considered a CDR.\n\nThe residues in these variable domains are located in two regions of the TCR, at the interface of the α- and β-chains and in the β-chain framework region that is thought to be in proximity to the CD3 signal-transduction complex. CDR3 is the main CDR responsible for recognizing processed antigen, although CDR1 of the alpha chain has also been shown to interact with the N-terminal part of the antigenic peptide, whereas CDR1 of the β-chain interacts with the C-terminal part of the peptide.\n\nCDR2 is thought to recognize the MHC. CDR4 of the β-chain is not thought to participate in antigen recognition, but has been shown to interact with superantigens.\n\nThe constant domain of the TCR consists of short connecting sequences in which a cysteine residue forms disulfide bonds, which form a link between the two chains.\n\nThe TCR is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a large group of proteins involved in binding, recognition, and adhesion; the family is named after antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). The TCR is similar to a half-antibody consisting of a single heavy and single light chain, except the heavy chain is without its crystallisable fraction (Fc). The two subunits of TCR are twisted together. Whereas the antibody uses its Fc region to bind to Fc Receptors on leukocytes, TCR is already docked onto the cell membrane. However, it is not able to mediate signal transduction itself due to its short cytoplasmic tail, so TCR still requires CD3 and zeta to carry out the signal transduction in its place, just as antibodies require binding to FcRs to initiate signal transduction. In this way the MHC-TCR-CD3 interaction for T cells is functionally similar to the antigen(Ag)-immunoglobulin(Ig)-FcR interaction for myeloid leukocytes, and Ag-Ig-CD79 interaction for B cells.\n\nThe generation of TCR diversity is similar to that for antibodies and B-cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA-encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation, and T cells do not express activation-induced cytidine deaminase(AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).\n\nEach recombined TCR possess unique antigen specificity, determined by the structure of the antigen-binding site formed by the α and β chains in case of αβ T cells or γ and δ chains on case of γδ T cells.\n\n\nThe intersection of these specific regions (V and J for the alpha or gamma chain; V, D, and J for the beta or delta chain) corresponds to the CDR3 region that is important for peptide/MHC recognition (see above).\n\nIt is the unique combination of the segments at this region, along with palindromic and random nucleotide additions (respectively termed \"P-\" and \"N-\"), which accounts for the even greater diversity of T-cell receptor specificity for processed antigenic peptides.\n\nLater during development, individual CDR loops of TCR can be re-edited in the periphery outside thymus by reactivation of recombinases using a process termed TCR revision (editing) and change its antigenic specificity.\n\nIn the plasma membrane the TCR receptor chains α and β associate with six additional adaptor proteins to form an octameric complex. The complex contains both α and β chains, forming the ligand-binding site, and the signaling modules CD3δ, CD3γ, CD3ε and CD3ζ in the stoichiometry TCR α β - CD3εγ - CD3εδ - CD3ζζ. Charged residues in the transmembrane domain of each subunit form polar interactions allowing a correct and stable assembly of the complex. The cytoplasmic tail of the TCR is extremely short, hence the CD3 adaptor proteins contain the signalling motifs needed for propagating the signal from the triggered TCR into the cell.\nThe signalling motifs involved in TCR signalling are tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of these adaptor proteins that can be phosphorylated in the event of TCR-pMHC binding. The tyrosine residues reside in a specific amino acid sequence of the signature Yxx(L/I)x6-8Yxx(L/I), where Y, L, I indicate tyrosine, leucine and isoleucine residues, x denotes any amino acids, the subscript 6-8 indicates a sequence of 6 to 8 amino acids in length. This motif is very common in activator receptors of the non-catalytic tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor (NTR) family and is referred to as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). CD3δ, CD3γ and CD3ε each contain a single ITAM, while CD3ζ contains three ITAMs. In total the TCR complex contains 10 ITAMs. Phosphorylated ITAMs act as binding site for SH2-domains of additionally recruited proteins.\n\nEach T cell expresses clonal TCRs which recognize a specific peptide loaded on a MHC molecule (pMHC), either on MHC class II on the surface of antigen-presenting cells or MHC class I on any other cell type. \nA unique feature of T cells is their ability to discriminate between peptides derived from healthy, endogenous cells and peptides from foreign or abnormal (e.g. infected or cancerous) cells in the body. Antigen presenting cells do not discriminate between self and foreign peptides and typically express a large number of self derived pMHC on their cell surface and only a few copies of any foreign pMHC. For example, it has been shown that cells infected with HIV have only 8-46 HIV specific pMHCs next to 100000 total pMHC per cell.\n\nBecause T cells undergo positive selection in the thymus there is a non-negligible affinity between self pMHC and the TCR, nevertheless, the T-cell receptor signalling should not be activated by self pMHC such that endogenous, healthy cells are ignored by T cells. \nHowever, when these very same cells contain even minute quantities of pathogen derived pMHC, T cells must get activated and initiate immune responses. The ability of T cells to ignore healthy cells but respond when these same cells express a small number of foreign pMHC is known as antigen discrimination.\n\nTo do so, T cells have a very high degree of antigen specificity, despite of fact that the affinity to the peptide/MHC ligand is rather low in comparison to other receptor types. The affinity, given as the dissociation constant (\"K\"), between a TCR and a pMHC was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to be in the range of 1-100 μM, with an association rate (\"k\") of 1000 -10000 M s and a dissociation rate (\"k\") of 0.01 -0.1 s. In comparison, cytokines have an affinity of KD = 10-600 pM to their receptor. \nIt has been shown that even a single amino acid change in the presented peptide that affects the affinity of the pMHC to the TCR reduces the T cell response and cannot be compensated by a higher pMHC concentration. A negative correlation between the dissociation rate of the pMHC-TCR complex and the strength of the T cell response has been observed. That means, pMHC that bind the TCR for a longer time initiate a stronger activation of the T cell. \nFurthermore, T cells are very sensitive. Interaction with a single pMHC is enough to trigger activation. Also, the decision whether a T cell response to an antigen is made fast. T cells rapidly scan pMHC on an antigen presenting cell to increase the change of finding a specific pMHC. On average, T cell encounter 20 APCs per hour.\n\nDifferent models for the molecular mechanisms that underlie this highly specific and highly sensitive process of antigen discrimination have been proposed. The occupational model simply suggests that the TCR response is proportional to the number of pMHC bound to the receptor. Given this model, a shorter lifetime of a peptide can be compensated by higher concentration such that the maximum response of the T cell stays the same. However, this cannot be seen in experiments and the model has been widely rejected.\nThe most accepted view is that the TCR engages in kinetic proofreading. \nThe kinetic proofreading model proposes that a signal is not directly produced upon binding but a series of intermediate steps insure a time delay between binding and signal output. Such intermediate \"proofreading\" steps can be multiple rounds of tyrosine phosphorylation. These steps require energy and therefore do not happen spontaneously, only when the receptor is bound to its ligand. This way only ligands with high affinity that bind the TCR for a long enough time can initiate a signal. All intermediate steps are reversible, such that upon ligand dissociation the receptor reverts to its original unphosphorylated state before a new ligand binds.\nThis model predicts that maximum response of T cells decreases for pMHC with shorter lifetime. Experiments have confirmed this model.\nHowever, the basic kinetic proofreading model has a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Increasing the number of proofreading steps increases the specificity but lowers the sensitivity of the receptor. The model is therefore not sufficient to explain the high sensitivity and specificity of TCRs that have been observed. (Altan Bonnet2005) Multiple models that extend the kinetic proofreading model have been proposed, but evidence for the models is still controversial.\n\nThe antigen sensitivity is higher in antigen-experienced T cells than in naive T cells. Naive T cells pass through the process of functional avidity maturation with no change in affinity. It is based on the fact that effector and memory (antigen-experienced) T cell are less dependent on costimulatory signals and higher antigen concentration than naive T cell.\n\nThe essential function of the TCR complex is to identify specific bound antigen derived from a potentially harmful pathogen and elicit a distinct and critical response. At the same time it has to ignore any self-antigen and tolerate harmless antigens such as food antigens. The signal transduction mechanism by which a T cell elicits this response upon contact with its unique antigen is termed T-cell activation. \nUpon binding to pMHC, the TCR initiates a signalling cascade, involving transcription factor activation and cytoskeletal remodelling resulting in T cell activation. Active T cells secrete cytokines, undergo rapid proliferation, have cytotoxic activity and differentiate into effector and memory cells. When the TCR is triggered, T cells form an immunological synapse allowing them to stay in contact with the antigen presenting cell for several hours.\nOn a population level, T cell activation depends on the strength of TCR stimulation, the dose–response curve of ligand to cytokine production is sigmoidal. However, T cell activation on a single cell level can be characterised by a digital switch-like response, meaning the T cell is fully activated if the stimulus is higher than a given threshold, otherwise the T cell stay in its non-activated state. There is no intermediate activation state. The robust sigmoid dose-response curve on population level results from individual T cells having slightly different thresholds.\n\nT cells need three signals to become fully activated. Signal 1 is provided by the T-cell receptor when recognising a specific antigen on a MHC molecule. Signal 2 comes from co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28, presented on the surface of other immune cells. It is expressed only when an infection was detected by the innate immune system, it is a \"Danger indicating signal\". This two-signal system makes sure that T cells only respond to harmful pathogens and not to self-antigens. An additional third signal is provided by cytokines, which regulate the differentiation of T cells into different subsets of effector T cells.\nThere are myriad molecules involved in the complex biochemical process (called trans-membrane signaling) by which T-cell activation occurs. Below, the signalling cascade is described in detail.\n\nThe initial triggering follows the mechanism common for all NTR receptor family members. \nOnce the TCR binds a specific pMHC, the tyrosine residues of the [Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif]s (ITAMs) in its CD3 adaptor proteins are phosphorylated. The residues serve as docking sites for downstream signalling molecules, which can propagate the signal.\nPhosphorylation of ITAMs is mediate by the Scr kinase Lck. Lck is anchored to the plasma membrane by associating with the co-receptor CD4 or CD8, depending on the T cell subtype. CD4 is expressed on helper T cells and regulatory T cells, and is specific for MHC class II. CD8, on the other hand, specific for MHC class I, is expressed on cytotoxic T cells.\nBinding of the co-receptor to the MHC bring Lck in close proximity to the CD3 ITAMs. It has been shown that 40% of Lck is active even before the TCR binds pMHC and therefore has the ability to constantly phosphorylate the TCR. Tonic TCR signalling is avoided by the presence of phosphatase CD45 that removes phosphorylation from tyrosine residues and inhibits signal initiation. Upon binding the balance of kinase activity to phosphatase activity is perturbed, leading to a surplus of phosphorylation and initiation of the signal. How such perturbation is accomplished by TCR binding is still debated. Mechanisms involving conformational change of TCR, TCR aggregation and kinetic segregation have been suggested.\nTyrosine kinase Fyn might be involved in ITAM phosphorylation but is not essential for TCR signalling.\n\nPhosphorylated ITAMs in the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 recruit protein tyrosine kinase Zap70 that can bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues with its SH2 domain. This brings Zap70 into close proximity to Lck which results to its phosphorylation and activation by Lck. Lck phosphorylates a number of different proteins in the TCR pathway.\nOnce activated, Zap70 is able to phosphorylate multiple tyrosine residues of the transmembrane protein LAT. \nLAT is a scaffold protein associated with the membrane. It itself does not have any catalytic activity but it provides binding sites for signalling molecules via phosphorylated tyrosine residues. LAT associates with another scaffolding protein Slp-76 via the Grap2 adaptor protein, which provides additional binding sites. Together LAT and Slp-76 provide a platform for the recruitment of many downstream signalling molecules. By bringing these signalling molecules into close proximity, they can then be activated by Lck, Zap70 and others kinases. Therefore, the LAT/Slp76 complex act as a highly cooperative signalosome.\n\nMolecules that bind the LAT/Slp76 complex include: Phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), SOS via a Grb2 adaptor, Itk, Vav, Nck1 and Fyb.\n\nPLCγ is a very important enzyme in the pathway as it generates second messenger molecules. It is activated by the tyrosine kinase Itk which is recruited to the cell membrane by binding to Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is produced by the action of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI-3K), which phosphorylates Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce PIP3. It is not known that PI-3K is activated by the T cell receptor itself, but there is evidence that CD28, a co-stimulatory receptor providing the second signal, is able to activate PI-3K. The interaction between PLCγ, Itk and PI-3K could be the point in the pathway where the first and the second signal are integrated. Only if both signals are present, PLCγ is activated.\nOnce PLCγ is activated by phosphorylation, it hydrolyses PIP2 into two secondary messenger molecules, namely the membrane-bound diacyl glycerol(DAG) and the soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).\n\nThese second messenger molecules amplify the TCR signal and distribute the prior localised activation to the entire cell and activate protein cascades that finally lead to the activation of transcription factors. \nTranscription factors involved in T cell signalling pathway are the NFAT, NF-κB and AP1, a heterodimer of proteins Fos and Jun. All three transcription factors are needed to activate the transcription of interleukin-2(IL2) gene.\n\n\"NFAT\" activation depends on calcium signaling. \nIP3 produced by PLC-γ is no longer bound to the membrane and diffuses rapidly in the cell. Binding of IP3 to calcium channel receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the release of calcium (Ca) into the cytosol. The resulting low Ca concentration in the ER causes STIM1 clustering on the ER membrane, which in turn leads to activation of cell membrane CRAC channels that allows additional calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. Therefore, levels of Ca are strongly increased in the T cell. This cytosolic calcium binds calmodulin, inducing a conformational change of the protein such that it can then bind and activate calcineurin. Calcineurin, in turn, dephosphorylates NFAT. In its deactivated state, NFAT cannot enter the nucleus as its nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) cannot be recognised by nuclear transporters due to phosphorylation by GSK-3. When dephosphorylated by Calcineurin translocation of NFAT into the nucleus is possible.\nAdditionally, there is evidence that PI-3K via signal molecules recruits the protein kinase AKT to the cell membrane. AKT is able to deactivate GSK3 and thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of NFAT, which could contribute to NFAT activation.\n\n\"NF-κB\" activation is initiated by DAG, the second, membrane bound product of PLCγ hydrolysation of PIP2. DAG binds and recruits Protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) to the membrane where it can activated the membrane bound scaffold protein CARMA1. CARMA1 then undergoes a conformational change which allow it to oligomerise and bind the adapter proteins BCL10, CARD domain and MALT1. This multisubunit complex binds the Ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. Ubiquitination of TRAF6 serves as scaffold to recruit NEMO, IκB kinase (IKK) and TAK1. TAK 1 phosphorylates IKK, which in turn phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of I-κB.\nI-κB blocks the NLS of NF-κB therefore preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Once I-κB is degraded, it cannot loser bind to NF-κB and the NLS of NF-κB becomes accessible for nuclear translocation.\n\nActivation of \"AP1\" involves three MAPK signalling pathways. These pathway use a phosphorylation cascade of three successive acting protein kinases to transmit a signal. \nThe three MAPK pathways in T cells involve kinases of different specificities belonging to each of the MAP3K, MAP2K, MAPK families. Initial activation is done by the GTPase Ras or Rac which phosphorylate the MAP3K.\nA cascade involving the enzymes Raf, MEK1, ERK results in the phosphorylation of Jun, conformational change allows Jun to bind to Fos and hence AP-1 to form. AP-1 then acts as transcription factor. Raf is activated via the second messenger DAG, SOS, and Ras. DAG recruits among other proteins the RAS guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), to the membrane. RasGRP activates the small GTPase Ras by exchanging Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to Ras against Guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Ras can also be activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS which binds to the LAT signalosom. Ras then initiates the MAPK cascade.\nThe second MAPK cascade with MEKK1, JNKK, JNK induces protein expression of Jun. Another cascade, also involving MEKK1 as MAPK3, but then activating MKK3 /6 and p38 induces Fos transcription. Activation of MEKK1, additionally to being activated by Ras, involves Slp-76 recruiting the GEF Vav to the LAT signalosom, which then activates the GTPase Rac. Rac and Ras activate MEKK1 and thereby initiate the MAPK cascade.\n\n\n"}

Like his ancestor, he is a fearless and skillful warrior in the Song imperial army. His weapon is a pair of steel clubs, which earn him the nickname \"Double Clubs\". In battles he flies a black war flag and rides a black stallion, a gift from Emperor Huizong.\n\nHuyan Zhuo‘s name is brought up when the Song imperial court discusses how to quell the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh. Grand Marshal Gao Qiu recommends to Emperor Huizong that Huyan is the man for the job. He is summoned from his military post at Runing Commandery (present-day Runan County, Henan) to the imperial capital Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan). The emperor appoints him the chief commander of the mission, with Han Tao and Peng Qi as his assistants.\n\nIn Huyan Zhuo's first encounter with Liangshan, he loses Peng Qi, who is captured and joins the outlaws. Huyan then sends out his special cavalry, consisting of groups of armour-clad horses linked by iron chains. The consolidated might of the horses as they charge forward overwhelms the Liangshan's forces. Song Jiang and his men hole themselves up in their stronghold pondering how to beat the cavalry. Meanwhile, Huyan requests Ling Zhen, an artillery officer and cannon maker, be sent to shell Liangshan. But Ling is lured into the marshes and captured by the outlaws. He too joins Liangshan.\n\nTang Long suggests his cousin Xu Ning, a lance instructor in the Imperial Capital, could be Liangshan‘s answer to Huyan's cavalry. Tang tricks Xu Ning to come to Liangshan. Trapped in the stronghold, Xu also becomes a chieftain and agrees to train some of Liangshan's foot soldiers in the use of the hooked lance. The lance topples Huyan's cavalry, routing his army. Han Tao also defects after being captured.\n\nDefeated by Liangshan, Huyan Zhuo dare not return to Dongjing. He heads to Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong) alone, hoping to redeem himself under the local governor Murong Yanda. The outlaws from Mount Peach Blossom steal his horse when he puts up in an inn. Reaching Qingzhou, he gets Murong‘s approval to attack Mount Peach Blossom. Murong instructs him to also stamp out the other bands of Mount White Tiger and Mount Twin Dragons. Twin Dragons‘ Lu Zhishen, Yang Zhi and Wu Song are formidable fighters, but the other two strongholds are easily beaten. Huyan even captures Kong Ming of Mount White Tiger.\n\nFinding Huyan Zhuo a tough enemy, the three mountains turn to Liangshan Marsh for reinforcement. With their forces combined, the four bands face off Huyan. Finally Song Jiang lures him into an ambush and captures him. Song‘s sincere words convince Huyan to join Liangshan. He then tricks Murong Yanda to open the gate of Qingzhou. After Qing Ming cut down the governor, the outlaws swarm into and plunder the city.\n\nGuan Sheng is sent by the Song imperial court to stamp out Liangshan. Huyan Zhuo comes to Guan claiming that he has reluctantly joined the bandits. He dupes Guan to launch a night raid on Song Jiang‘s camp. Guan is trapped and captured. He also joins Liangshan succumbing to Song Jiang's warm treatment. After the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly, Huyan Zhuo is appointed as one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Liangshan cavalry.\n\nFollowing amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan, Huyan Zhuo joins the outlaws in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory.

Originally trained as a surgeon, MacKenzie served as a civilian physician with the British Army during the Boer War where he first became aware of the principles of camouflage. During the First World War, MacKenzie made his own significant contributions to military camouflage, which he saw as closely related to golf course design. He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. He designed more than 50 golf courses including three that remain in the 2016 top 10 golf courses in the world: Augusta National Golf Club and Cypress Point Club in the US, and Royal Melbourne Golf Club (West Course) in Australia.\n\nMacKenzie was born in Normanton, near Leeds in Yorkshire, England, to parents of Scottish extraction. His mother, Mary Jane Smith MacKenzie, had family roots in Glasgow. His father, William Scobie MacKenzie, a medical doctor, had been born and raised in the Scottish Highlands near Lochinver. Although christened after his paternal grandfather Alexander, he was called \"Alister\" (Gaelic for Alexander) from birth. As a youth, MacKenzie and his family spent summers near Lochinver, on what had been traditional Clan MacKenzie lands from 1670 to 1745. MacKenzie's strong identification with his Scottish roots featured prominently in many aspects of his later life.\n\nMacKenzie attended Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, before going to Cambridge University, where he initially trained as a medical doctor, graduating in 1891 with a B.A. (Natural Science Tripos Part 1), with honours, third class, before the next year undertaking and passing a second MB (Bachelor of Medicine. Latin: \"Medicinae Baccalaureus\") Anatomy. After a period working in Leeds, he returned to Cambridge in 1895 where he undertook the third MB examination (Part 1) before passing the London Licentiate examinations for Royal College of Surgeons the same year. Finally, in 1897 he graduated from Cambridge University, with MB BacS (Bachelor of Surgery), and MA degrees.\n\nMacKenzie served as a surgeon with the Somerset Regiment in South Africa during the Second Boer War.\n\nDuring his wartime service, MacKenzie became interested in camouflage, which was effectively used by the Boers. As a result, during the First World War, when he once again served in the army, he worked not as a surgeon but as a camoufleur. In a lecture he gave on the subject, he said that \"the brilliant successes of the Boers [during his service in South Africa] were due to great extent to their making the best use of natural cover and the construction of artificial cover indistinguishable from nature.\"\n\nMacKenzie had been a member of several golf clubs near Leeds, dating back as far as the late 1890s. These included Ilkley between 1890 and 1900 and Leeds Golf Club from 1900 to 1910. In 1907, he was one of the founding members of The Alwoodley Golf Club, where he was both honorary secretary (1907-1909) and club captain (1912-1913), and he remained on its green committee until 1930. As the course was MacKenzie's original design when Alwoodley was laid out, it was his first opportunity to put many of his design theories to practical test. However, the committee at the time thought that some of his ideas were too expansive, so it called in Harry Colt for a second opinion. Colt was one of the leading golf course architects of the time and was also the secretary of Sunningdale Golf Club. Colt visited on two occasions only: first on 31 July 1907, when he met MacKenzie for the first time, and later on 6 October 1909. On the first occasion, four months after the course opened for play, having stayed at MacKenzie's house overnight, he realized that MacKenzie's ideas were very much an extension of his own, and he gave great support for MacKenzie's ideas at the meeting with the committee. He did, however, mention the bunkering as MacKenzie's ideas had taken into account the new technology of the day, which was the Haskell wound ball (which bounced and rolled) and was now being used instead of the old gutta-percha golf ball. Some of MacKenzie's modern ideas under discussion included undulating greens, long and narrow greens angled from the center of the fairway, fairly large and free-form bunker shapes, and substantial additional contouring. All of these remained part of his \"signature style\" throughout his career.\n\nIn 1914, MacKenzie won a golf hole design competition organized by \"Country Life\"; the adjudicator was Bernard Darwin. MacKenzie then took an active interest in course improvements at his own clubs, gaining experience in the newly emerging discipline of golf course design. He charted the Old Course at St. Andrews in great detail; by 1915 he had become a member of the R&A. In March 1924, he produced a map which remains well-known to the present day.\n\nFollowing the First World War, MacKenzie left medicine and began to work instead as a golf course designer in the United Kingdom, in association with Harry Colt and Charles Alison in 1919, with whom he formed the London firm of Colt, MacKenzie & Alison. Four years later, MacKenzie went his own way.\n\nMacKenzie thought he had learned a lot about golf course planning from having designed camouflage. There are references to the latter in his first book on course design, called \"Golf Architecture\" (MacKenzie 1920), such as when he writes that \"there is an extraordinary resemblance between what is now known as the camouflage of military earthworks and golf-course construction\", or later, when he states that there \"are many other attributes in common between the successful golf architect and the camoufleur. Both, if not actually artists, must have an artistic temperament, and have had an education in science.\" In the same book, he also writes that \"the chief object of every golf course architect worth his salt is to imitate the beauties of nature [and presumably also the hazards] so closely as to make his work indistinguishable from nature itself.\" His book was later included in Herbert Warren Wind's Classics of Golf Library.\n\nMacKenzie worked in an era before large scale earth moving became a major factor in golf course construction, and his designs are notable for their sensitivity to the nature of the original site.\n\n\nAs a player, MacKenzie was self-described as a \"good putter, but a mediocre ball striker\" for most of his life. It was not until after his move to California, when he was already in his 60s, that MacKenzie had what he described as his \"golfing epiphany\". This was an improvement in his ball striking which enabled him to often score in the high 70s to low 80s for 18 holes. He described this in one of his books as \"in the 70s after 60\". MacKenzie was one of the first prominent golf course designers who had not been a leading player.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he moved to the United States, where he carried out some of his most notable work, although he continued to design courses outside that country as well. Today, he is remembered as the designer of some of the world's finest courses, among them Century Country Club (Purchase, New York), as MacKenzie was partners with Colt & Alison at the time the two built Century, from mid-1923 he was working with other partners when he designed Augusta National Golf Club (Augusta, Georgia), Cypress Point Club (Monterey Peninsula, California), Royal Melbourne Golf Club (Melbourne, Australia), Pasatiempo Golf Club (Santa Cruz, California), Crystal Downs Country Club (Frankfort, Michigan), Lahinch Golf Course (Lahinch, Ireland), and Meadow Club (Fairfax, California) [see extended list of his courses below].\n\nMacKenzie died in Santa Cruz, California, in January 1934, two months before the inaugural Masters Tournament (then known as the Augusta National Invitational Tournament). Discovered after his death was an unpublished manuscript on golf and golf course design, which was posthumously published as \"The Spirit of St. Andrews\" (MacKenzie 1995).\n\nPontefract and District Golf Club, West Yorkshire, England (1932) including a number of classic Mackenzie green designs https://www.pdgc.co.uk\n\n"}
{"id": "2060588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060588", "title": "Ed Mirvish Theatre", "text": "Ed Mirvish Theatre\n\nThe Ed Mirvish Theatre is a historic film and play theatre in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was initially known as the Pantages Theatre, then became the Imperial Theatre and later the Canon Theatre, before it was renamed in honour of Ed Mirvish, a well-known businessman and theatre impresario. The theatre was first opened in 1920 and is located near Yonge-Dundas Square.\n\nThe Pantages Theatre opened in 1920 as a combination vaudeville and motion picture house. Designed by the theatre architect Thomas W. Lamb, it was the largest cinema in Canada (originally having 3373 seats) and one of the most elegant.\n\nThe Pantages was built by the Canadian motion picture distributor Nathan L. Nathanson, founder of Famous Players Canadian Corporation, the Canadian motion picture distributing arm of Adolph Zukor's Paramount Pictures. While Famous Players retained ownership, management and booking were turned over to the Pantages organization, one of the largest vaudeville and motion picture theatre circuits in North America.\n\nThe Pantages circuit had its beginnings in Canada, in the Yukon. Pericles Alexander Pantages had been a sailor on a Greek merchant ship who left the sea in search of riches during the great 1897 Klondike Gold Rush. Although he found no gold, he became part owner of a small theatre in Dawson City – the Orpheum – that staged vaudeville and burlesque shows. From this beginning, he built over a period of 30 years, a large entertainment company that would eventually include a Hollywood film studio, a vaudeville booking agency and ownership or control of more than 120 theatres across Canada and the western United States – most of which were known as \"The Pantages\". The Toronto theatre was the easternmost house of the Pantages circuit, which then dominated the western market; in the east development was blocked by competition from the Keith-Albee-Orpheum vaudeville chain.\n\nIn 1929 Alexander Pantages was convicted of the rape of Eunice Pringle, a 17-year-old chorus girl, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Although the conviction was overturned on appeal, the scandal and the legal costs ruined Pantages. To the public, he had \"got away with it\" thanks to a clever lawyer. In 1930, he was forced to sell his theatres at a loss; most of his assets were bought by RKO Pictures.\nWith the collapse of the Pantages circuit, the Pantages name came off the marquees of almost all the theatres. In 1930 the Toronto Pantages was renamed the Imperial, and became exclusively a cinema – no more live vaudeville. Management and control were taken over by Famous Players, which retained ownership for more than 50 years.\n\nIn 1972, the Imperial closed after a 9-month run of \"The Godfather\", and was divided into six separate cinemas by Toronto architect Mandel Sprachman. The Yonge façade was replaced with a modern front without canopy. It was officially reopened by Mayor David Crombie in 1973 as the \"Imperial Six\". Cinema 1 was built forward from the balcony edge toward the top half of the stage proscenium arch. Cinema 2 was located on the original balcony. Cinemas 3 and 4 were built in the original stage house, with cinema 3 being on top in the loft and cinema 4 underneath on the stage floor, and both accessed by a long glass walkway that ran the length of the building exterior above Victoria Street. Cinemas 5 and 6 were in the original main floor seating area, divided in half by a partition wall.\n\nAll traces of its elegant past, including the gold leaf and faux marble balustrades, were painted over with bold colours of yellow, red, blue, black, and silver, with the walls carpeted in red and blue. The entrance at Yonge Street was a modern-looking, aluminum-paneled front, with no canopy or vertical, featuring a large circle opening above the entrance into a brightly lit open outdoor square with bright modern marquee panels above on 3 sides, and 6 television screens on each side of the approach to the entrance doors showing movie trailers of features and coming attractions. The TV screens were later replaced by poster cases due to visibility problems with sunlight washing out the TV screens and technical problems with the early 1-inch video tape machines (12 in total, a separate machine for each screen).\n\nThe Imperial Six was a big money-maker for Famous Players throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, playing all the big releases including all the James Bond and Rocky releases. It had the same manager, Philip A. Traynor, from well before it closed for renovations in 1972, until its last day of operations by Famous Players in 1986. Following the closing of the Imperial Six, Traynor moved to the Plaza Cinemas and subsequently retired from Famous Players.\n\nThe Imperial Six sat on three separate lots. Famous Players owned the Yonge Street entrance, which bridged an alley and connected to the main building on Victoria Street, and they also owned the front half of the main theatre building, from the centre of the dome to the back wall of the stage house. The other half of the main theatre building, from the centre of the dome to the north wall of the main lobby, was leased from Edna Rakas in Michigan, whose family had owned the property previous to the original construction of the theatre in 1920.\n\nFamous Players Development Corp., an arms-length real estate company spun off from Famous Players Ltd. in the 1970s, and based in New York, attempted to negotiate with Rakas in February 1986 to renew the lease at a more favourable rate. When the lease expired on May 24, 1986 with no agreement in place, Rakas announced her intention to approach Famous Players' rival cinema chain, Cineplex Odeon Corporation. The representatives for Famous Players Development suggested that Cineplex Odeon would have no use for \"half a theatre\".\n\nThey were wrong however, Garth Drabinsky, (CEO of Cineplex Odeon at the time), flew to Michigan the same day that his company was contacted by Rakas' lawyers, and signed a lease. The following day, May 31, 1986, with the assistance of a bailiff and paid security, Cineplex Odeon seized control of the north half of the Imperial Six, thus effectively locked Famous Players out of their flagship downtown Toronto theatre, including the theatre offices, all the lobby space, four of the six projection booths, all of Cinema 2, and the back half of Cinemas 5 and 6. Temporary walls were erected to keep Famous Players out of Cineplex Odeon's space. The Supreme Court of Ontario dismissed Famous Players' application of an injunction blocking Cineplex Odeon's lease on June 2, 1986. \n\nCineplex Odeon made plans to open their half of the theatre despite the lack of an entrance on Yonge Street. This meant replacing the fire exits, which were all on the Famous Players' end of the main theatre building. Initial plans were to completely gut their half and build a new multiplex cinema, which would augment the nearby Eaton Centre Cineplex, increasing their presence in downtown Toronto. However, because of the elegant grand lobby, vaulted ornate plaster ceilings, columns and grand staircase, plans to gut the building and build as many as eight screens were dropped, and instead plans were drawn up for a three-screen cinema utilizing as much of the existing interior as possible. This would maintain the historic grandness which did not exist in any of the other theatre properties owned and operated by Cineplex Odeon, as most of them dated from after World War II when J. Arthur Rank came to Canada to start Odeon Theatres of Canada.\n\nThe need for new fire exits, and the fact that the grand lobby occupied a major part of the space under the original balcony, made the construction of two smaller cinemas on the main floor impractical. The final plan was for a single-screen 800-seat stadium-style cinema utilizing the only complete auditorium on their half, which had been Cinema 2 on the original balcony.\nAfter a costly construction project, the single-screen Pantages Cinema opened on December 12, 1987. The cinema entrance was located on Victoria Street, which did not get as much foot traffic as Yonge Street.\n\nThe loss of the Imperial Six led to a corporate shakeup at Famous Players' head office, which saw the ousting of their long-time President George Destounis, even though Famous Players Ltd. in Toronto was not involved with the failed lease renegotiation. Famous Players responded in late 1987 when the company planned to built 11 theatres with 60 screens in eight Canadian cities. The war between Famous Players and Cineplex Odeon continued; the bitterness between the two rival chains was very much in play at the gala opening of the Pantages Cinema. In an attempt to disrupt the screening of \"Wall Street\", Famous Players organized a construction crew to stand by with jackhammers 5 feet behind the Pantages screen, on the other side of the drywall partition between the two companies' halves of the property. Famous Players also called in a complaint about the fire exits; less than an hour before the scheduled gala event, a Toronto Fire Department inspection confirmed that the fire exits were still incomplete, with wet concrete, and the gala was moved to the Varsity Cinemas.\n\nCrews worked around the clock to finish the fire exits, and the cinema opened to the public the next day with its scheduled run of \"Wall Street\". Following the opening, Famous Players removed the doors from every fire exit on their half to allow freezing cold winter air to fill their portion of the building. The partition wall between Cineplex Odeon and Famous Players had been built as a fire wall and was not insulated as an exterior wall.\n\nOther films that showed during this brief time as a single-screen cinema were \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\", \"Colors\", and a gala screening attended by director Robert Redford for the launch of his film \"The Milagro Beanfield War\".\n\nAfter a long, bitter legal fight, Famous Players eventually agreed to sell their portions of the original theatre and Yonge Street entrance to Cineplex Odeon, but the victory was a pyrrhic one: as was standard practice for Famous Players when they sold a major downtown theatre property, they attached a condition to the sale forbidding Cineplex from ever again using the theatre for motion pictures. The last film ever to play in the Pantages Cinema was \"Die Hard\".\n\nEven before the Pantages closed to movies on August 26, 1988, Garth Drabinsky had a vision for restoring the complete theatre intact to its original 1920 look and creating a new live entertainment division of Cineplex Odeon. At the time, Toronto was experiencing a renaissance in live theatre, and there was an interest both to restore large historic theatres; such as the ambitious restoration at the Elgin & Winter Garden Theatre by the Ontario Heritage Foundation only one block to the south, and to create more venues that could attract big successful Broadway shows to Toronto, such as the successful runs that \"Cats\" had enjoyed earlier in the 1980s.\n\nWith the successful acquisition of Famous Players' remaining portions of the theatre, it was announced that the cinema would close and be restored to its former 1920 glory. Work began in earnest immediately following the closing of the cinema, with interior demolition work removing all the 1973 partition walls, floors, fire exits and passageways, as well as excavating the entire basement underneath the original theatre floor to allow for deeper below grade spaces to accommodate modern live theatre amenities. All of the original plasterwork, some of which had been hidden behind drywall during the 1973 multiplexing, was kept and restored. The original paint colours from 1920 were researched, with experts on scaffolds using fine instruments to pick away layer after layer of paint. Black and white original photos were studied to faithfully recreate everything from the fountain on the grand staircase, to the ticket box in the Yonge Street link, to the ornate marquee and canopy on Yonge Street with the original Pantages vertical as it had looked at its original opening in 1920.\n\nThe \"new\" 2,200-seat Pantages reopened in 1989 with its first legitimate theatre production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\", starring Colm Wilkinson and Rebecca Caine, which played at the Pantages for more than a decade.\n\nThe Pantages was operated by a division of Cineplex Odeon known as Livent. After a battle for control of Cineplex between its founder, Garth Drabinsky, and Cineplex Odeon's majority shareholder, MCA, Livent became an independent company, with no ties to the parent corporation. Livent continued to own and operate the Pantages until 1999, when the theatre was purchased, along with other assets of the bankrupt Livent, by Clear Channel Entertainment.\n\nOwnership fell to Live Nation, owners of Broadway Across Canada and Broadway Across America, a subsidiary of Clear Channel, which turned management of the facility over to Mirvish Productions, also giving Mirvish right of first negotiation should the theatre ever be put up for sale.\nIn July, 2001, Live Nation announced a sponsorship for the theatre from Canon Canada, Inc. In recognition of this sponsorship, the theatre was renamed the Canon Theatre.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Key Brand Entertainment announced that it had acquired all of Live Nation's North American theatrical assets. Key Brand Entertainment is owned and controlled by British theatre producer John Gore and led by entertainment industry veteran Thomas B. McGrath. As part of the financing arrangements for the purchase of Live Nation's assets, Key Brand agreed to sell both the Canon Theatre and the nearby Panasonic Theatre. Honouring the original lease agreement between Mirvish Productions and Live Nation, Key Brand offered Mirvish Productions the right of first negotiation and Mirvish Productions successfully bid to purchase both theatres.\n\nThis bid prompted Toronto-based theatre producer Aubrey Dan, of Dancap Productions, a minority shareholder in Key Brand, to seek an injunction forbidding the sale. Mr. Dan's injunction application was dismissed by the court on August 19, 2008, and sale of the theatres to Mirvish Productions was allowed to proceed.\n\nOn December 6, 2011, the theatre was renamed to honour Ed Mirvish, who died in July, 2007.\n\nOn October 1, 1979, the City of Toronto listed the property on the City of Toronto Heritage Property Inventory. On June 13, 1988, the property was designated under Part IV of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" resulting in heritage protection for the theatre.\n\nThere are plans to relocate one of the iconic Honest Ed's signs to the façade at the 244 Victoria St. entrance of the theatre, pending city approval and restoration of the sign.\n\n"}

Starting as a youth, he and his four brothers toured North America as a singing act called the Van Evera Brothers. After leaving his brothers and dropping \"Evera\" from his name, Van performed as a singer, leading the Billy Van Four and later the Billy Van Singers, and making frequent appearances on Canadian variety television shows such as \"Fancy Free\". The single \"I Miss You\" / \"The Last Sunrise\" by the Billy Van Four, released on the Rodeo International label, peaked at number 29 on the CHUM Chart in Toronto in March 1961.\n\nAs a comedian, Van gained national attention in 1963 as a performer on CBC Television's late-night satire programme \"Nightcap\". He threatened to quit the show after three seasons when the CBC wouldn't give him a requested raise from $400 to $500 an episode. At that time, a columnist in \"The Globe and Mail\" called Van \"perhaps the most talented variety performer ever developed by the CBC.\" After the dispute became public, the CBC capitulated and Van continued on the show for one final season. Van appeared in a six-part spinoff series, \"Flemingdon Park\", based on a recurring \"Nightcap\" skit, that aired at the beginning of 1967. \"Nightcap\" was cancelled in May 1967. In the United States he appeared in many commercials for Colt 45 Malt Liquor as a man sitting at a table waiting for a drink, unfazed by everything going on around him; Van starred in these commercials throughout the 60s and 70s, and won a Clio Award for one of these commercials in 1975.\n\nThrough the 1970s, Van was a regular member of the \"home team\" on the CHCH-TV charades series \"Party Game\". In 1971, he began making \"The Hilarious House of Frightenstein\", also for CHCH in Hamilton, Ontario. It is this show for which he is best known, and it has developed a cult following. 130 episodes were produced, and Van played almost every lead character. The characters included the Count (Count Frightenstein, for which he put on a fake Bela Lugosi-type voice); Grizelda the Ghastly Gourmet (an old witch with a cauldron who did a cooking show); the Wolfman, who, in an imitation of DJ Wolfman Jack would play records, and dance to them, while wearing a werewolf costume (rock songs from Sly and the Family Stone, The Archies, or other bands of the era were played in their entirety); the Librarian, an ancient bearded character who tried \"to horrify you\" with benign fairy tales from dusty old cobwebbed volumes, then would be disappointed when the unseen viewers were not horrified; Dr. Petvet, who would bring animals onto a set and talk about them (his catchphrase was \"Pets are friends\"); and the Oracle, who would give astrological readings, and answer fake letters from viewers while wearing a large headdress and speaking in a fake Peter Lorre voice.\n\nVan was a regular performer on \"The Ray Stevens Show\", \"The Ken Berry \"Wow\" Show\", \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\", \"The Bobby Vinton Show\", and the \"Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show\", most of which were co-produced by Chris Bearde, who had been a writer-performer on \"Nightcap\". In 1982, he co-hosted TVOntario's \"Bits and Bytes\", a show devoted to the usage of early (mostly 8-bit) personal computers, a role returned to 1991 in \"Bits and Bytes 2\". Van narrated the animated program \"Eureka!\", which taught children about physics and chemistry. Van also appeared occasionally in the Canadian TV show \"Bizarre\", hosted by John Byner.\n\nHe had a triple heart bypass in 1998.\n\nVan supported the Canadian Comedy Awards with promotional appearances from the awards' inception in 2000.\n\nHe was diagnosed in December 2001 with esophageal cancer, of which he died at age 68 on 8 January 2003 at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital. He was survived by his wife Susan and two daughters, Tracy and Robin, from previous marriages.\n\nOne of Van's brothers, Jack Van Evera, also became an actor and appeared on many Canadian television series such as \"The Forest Rangers\" and \"Adventures in Rainbow Country\".\n\nBilly Van wrote his autobiography \"Second Banana\" in 1997, which was published online on August 11, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2060628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060628", "title": "Abrictosaurus", "text": "Abrictosaurus\n\nAbrictosaurus (; \"wakeful lizard\") is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Period of what is now southern Africa. It was a small bipedal herbivore or omnivore, approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) long, and weighing less than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).\n\nThis dinosaur is known from the fossil remains of only two individuals, found in the Upper Elliot Formation of Qacha's Nek District in Lesotho and Cape Province in South Africa. The Upper Elliot is thought to date from the Hettangian and Sinemurian stages of the Early Jurassic Period, approximately 200 to 190 million years ago. This formation is thought to preserve sand dunes as well as seasonal floodplains, in a semiarid environment with sporadic rainfall. Other dinosaurs found in this formation include the theropod \"Megapnosaurus\", the sauropodomorph \"Massospondylus\", as well as other heterodontosaurids like \"Heterodontosaurus\" and \"Lycorhinus\". Remains of terrestrial crocodylomorphs, cynodonts and early mammals are also abundant.\n\nHeterodontosaurids like \"Abrictosaurus\" were small, early ornithischians, named for their markedly heterodont dentition. They are best known for the large, canine-like tusks (often called \"caniniforms\") in both upper and lower jaws. There were no teeth in the front of the jaws, where a hard beak was used to crop vegetation. There were three premaxillary teeth, with the first two small and conical and the third enlarged to form the upper caniniform, counterpart to the even larger lower caniniform, which was the first dentary tooth. In the upper jaw, a large gap (or diastema) accommodated the lower caniniform tooth and separated the premaxillary teeth from the wider chewing teeth of the maxilla. Similar teeth lined the remainder of the lower jaw.\n\n\"Abrictosaurus\" is usually considered the most basal member of the family Heterodontosauridae. \"Lycorhinus\" and \"Heterodontosaurus\" both had high-crowned cheek teeth, which overlapped each other in the jaw, forming a continuous chewing surface analogous to those of Cretaceous hadrosaurids. \"Abrictosaurus\" had more widely separated cheek teeth, with lower crowns, more similar to other early ornithischians. It has been suggested that \"Abrictosaurus\" lacked tusks and that this is another primitive feature. However, caniniforms were clearly present on one of the two specimens of \"Abrictosaurus\". The upper caniniform measured 10.5 millimeters (0.4 inches) high, while the lower reached 17 mm (0.67 in). These caniniforms were serrated only on the anterior surface, unlike those of \"Lycorhinus\" and \"Heterodontosaurus\", which were serrated on both anterior and posterior edges. \"Abrictosaurus\" also had smaller, less powerful forelimbs than \"Heterodontosaurus\" and one fewer phalanx bone in both the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb.\n\nBoth specimens of \"Abrictosaurus\" are housed in the collection of University College London. The holotype specimen was discovered in Lesotho and consists of a partial skull and skeleton (UCL B54). Paleontologist Richard Thulborn, who first described the specimen in 1974, considered it a new species of \"Lycorhinus\" and named it \"L. consors\", using the Latin word \"\" which means 'companion' or 'spouse'. As UCL B54 lacked the caniniforms which had been found in the type species, \"Lycorhinus angustidens\", Thulborn believed it to be female. Neither the skull nor the skeletons of \"Abrictosaurus\" have been fully described in the literature. A tooth from the latest Triassic of Switzerland has been assigned to \"Abrictosaurus\" sp., but this has not been supported, as the specimen does not have unique characteristics of \"Abrictosaurus\", heterodontosaurids, or ornithischians in general.\n\nIn 1975, James Hopson redescribed a fragmentary heterodontosaur skull (UCL A100) found in South Africa that Thulborn had previously assigned to \"Lycorhinus angustidens\". After showing that UCL A100 could not belong to \"L. angustidens\" but was instead more similar to UCL B54, Hopson erected a new genus to contain both specimens. The generic name \"Abrictosaurus\" (from the Greek \"αβρικτος\" (') meaning 'wakeful' and \"σαυρος\" (') meaning 'lizard') refers to Hopson's disagreement with Thulborn's hypothesis that heterodontosaurids underwent periods of aestivation (hibernation during hot and/or dry seasons). The specific name was retained, creating the new binomial \"Abrictosaurus consors\". Despite Hopson's renaming, Thulborn continued to consider \"Lycorhinus angustidens\", \"Heterodontosaurus tucki\", and \"Abrictosaurus consors\" to be three species of the genus \"Lycorhinus\". Most paleontologists maintain all three genera separately, although there is no precise definition of a species or genus in paleontology.\n\nThe hypothesis of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on \"Abrictosaurus\". Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including musk deer, walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions that it was female; perhaps even a female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that \"A. consors\" also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that it is at least a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a secondary sexual characteristic, weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.\n"}

In 1899 he graduated from Moscow Imperial University with a law degree; was conscripted by the army and served in a grenadier regiment. In 1902 he enrolled at Moscow Theological Academy and by 1906 he had been elevated to the dignity of archimandrite and was appointed rector of the seminary at Tula.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik Revolution he was arrested several times and in 1922 exiled to Kazakhstan. In 1926 he returned to Saint Petersburg (which had been renamed Leningrad) and was appointed Archbishop of Khutyn, that is, the vicar of the Diocese of Novgorod.\n\nOn July 29, 1927, Metropolitan Sergei Stragorodsky, acting as de facto head of the Russian Orthodox Church, signed a statement of unconditional loyalty to the Soviet State. The statement was co-signed by all members of the Holy Synod, and Archbishop Alexy of Khutyn.\n\nHe ran the diocese for much of the next seven years while Metropolitan Arsenius (Stadnitsky) was in prison or exile. In 1933 Alexius served briefly as Archbishop of Novgorod (for several months) and then metropolitan of Leningrad.\n\nIn the early hours of September 5, 1943, Metropolitan Alexius together with Metropolitan Sergius and Metropolitan Nicholas (Yarushevich) met with Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin where a historic decision was made regarding the fate of the Church in the state ruled by the militantly atheist Communist party. In the midst of the Second World War Stalin decided to allow the Russian Orthodox Church to legally function again after two decades of severe persecution. Restrictions on the Patriarchate of Moscow were relaxed somewhat and many churches throughout the Soviet Union were re-opened. Stalin tried to appeal to patriotic feelings of the Russian people especially the peasantry (backbone of the Red Army), many of whom grew up in still deeply religious families.\n\nWhen Patriarch Sergei died on May 15, 1944, Metropolitan Alexy took his place as Patriarchal \"locum tenens\". In his first statement after assuming control of the Church, the Metropolitan assured Stalin of his \"profound affection and gratitude\" and vowed to \"safeguard the Church against mistakes and false steps\".\n\nOn February 2, 1945, with Stalin's approval, Alexius I was elected Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia and enthroned on February 4, 1945.\n\nIn 1946 Alexius I presided over the controversial \"re-unification\" of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church with ROC seen by many as a takeover forced by the Stalinist government.\n\nAlso in 1946, Patriarch Alexius called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union to reject all allegiance to the Pope: \"Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!\"\n\nPope Pius XII replied: \"Who does not know, that Patriarch Alexius I recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church. In a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter, which contributed not a little to the persecution?\"\n\nPatriarch Alexius joined the World Peace Council, \"a Soviet front organization,\" when it was founded in 1949. According to Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, both Patriarch Alexius and Metropolitan Nicholas \"were highly valued by the KGB as agents of influence.\"\n\nAfter the death of Stalin on March 5, 1953, the Patriarch composed a personal statement of condolence to the USSR's Council of Ministers. It read, \"His death is a heavy grief for our Fatherland and for all the people who inhabit it. The whole Russian Orthodox Church, which will never forget his benevolent attitude to Church needs, feels great sorrow at his death. The bright memory of him will live ineradicably in our hearts. Our Church proclaims eternal memory to him with a special feeling of abiding love.\"\n\nIn 1955, Patriarch Alexius declared, \"The Russian Orthodox Church supports the totally peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union, not because the Church lacks freedom, but because Soviet policy is just and corresponds to the Christian ideals which the Church preaches.\"\n\nAfter 1958, however, members of the Russian Orthodox Church also had to endure a new wave of persecution, mostly carried out on the orders of the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nDespite this, Patriarch Alexius was permitted by the KGB to enroll the Russian Orthodox Church into the Christian Peace Conference in 1958 and the World Council of Churches in 1961.\n\nIn 1965, Fathers Gleb Yakunin and Nikolai Eshilman wrote an open letter to Patriarch Alexius. According to Evgeny Barabanov, \"They showed convincingly how a significant part of the governing episcopate, with voluntary silence or cunning connivance, had assisted the Atheists to close churches, monasteries, and religious schools, to liquidate religious communities, to establish the illegal practice of registering christenings, and had yielded to them control over the assignment and transfer of priests.\"\n\nThe letter was published as \"samizdat\" (\"self-published\", i.e., underground press). In May 1966, Patriarch Alexius ordered both priests suspended from the ministry. Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn sharply criticized the treatment of Fathers Gleb and Nikolai in his own open letter to Patriarch Alexius.\n\nPatriarch Alexius died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 92 in 1970 and was buried in the Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra at Sergiyev Posad outside of Moscow.\n\nSupporters praise Alexius I for working hard to ensure the survival of the Christianity in Russia, advocating peace and inter-church unity, while opponents often accused him of complicity with the Soviet authorities.\n\nA leading critic of Patriarch Alexei's leadership is Father Gleb Yakunin who claims in his books and articles that the postwar hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church was controlled by KGB informants.\n"}
{"id": "2060634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060634", "title": "David Axelrod (political consultant)", "text": "David Axelrod (political consultant)\n\nDavid M. Axelrod (born February 22, 1955) is an American political consultant and analyst and former White House official. He is best known for being the chief strategist for Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. After Obama's election, Axelrod was appointed as Senior Advisor to the President. He left the position in early 2011 and became the Senior Strategist for Obama's successful re-election campaign in 2012. Axelrod wrote for the \"Chicago Tribune\", and joined CNN as Senior Political Commentator in 2015. , Axelrod serves as the director of the non-partisan University of Chicago Institute of Politics. His memoir is titled \"Believer: My Forty Years in Politics\".\n\nAxelrod was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, and grew up in its Stuyvesant Town area. He was raised in a liberal Jewish family and had his bar mitzvah ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Manhattan. His mother, Myril Bennett (née Davidson), was a journalist at \"PM,\" a liberal-leaning 1940s newspaper, and later an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam. His father, Joseph Axelrod, was a psychologist and avid baseball fan, who migrated from Eastern Europe to the United States at the age of eleven. He attended Public School 40 in Manhattan. Axelrod's parents separated when he was eight years old.\n\nDescribing the appeal of politics, he told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I got into politics because I believe in idealism. Just to be a part of this effort that seems to be rekindling the kind of idealism that I knew when I was a kid, it's a great thing to do. So I find myself getting very emotional about it.\" At thirteen years old, he was selling campaign buttons for Robert F. Kennedy. After graduating from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1972, Axelrod attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in political science.\n\nAs an undergraduate, Axelrod wrote for the \"Hyde Park Herald\", covering politics, and earned an internship at the \"Chicago Tribune\". He lost his father to suicide in 1977, around the time of his graduation. While at the University of Chicago he met his future wife, business student Susan Landau (daughter of research doctor Richard L. Landau), and they married in 1979. In June 1981, their first child, a daughter, was diagnosed with epilepsy at seven months of age.\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" hired Axelrod after his graduation from college. He worked there for eight years, covering national, state and local politics, becoming their youngest political writer in 1981. At 27, he became the City Hall Bureau Chief and a political columnist for the paper. He left the \"Tribune\" and joined the campaign of U.S. Senator Paul Simon as communications director in 1984. Within weeks he was promoted to co-campaign manager.\n\nIn 1985, Axelrod formed the political consultancy firm, Axelrod & Associates. In 1987 he worked on the successful reelection campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, while spearheading Simon's campaign for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. This established his experience in working with black politicians; he later became a key player in similar mayoral campaigns of black candidates, including Dennis Archer in Detroit, Michael R. White in Cleveland, Anthony A. Williams in Washington, D.C., Lee P. Brown in Houston, and John F. Street in Philadelphia. Axelrod is a longtime strategist for the former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and styles himself a \"specialist in urban politics.\" \"The Economist\" notes he also specializes in \"packaging black candidates for white voters\".\n\nIn January 1990, Axelrod was hired to be the media consultant for the all but official re-election campaign of Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt. However, Goldschmidt announced in February that he would not seek re-election. Axelrod was retained by the Liberal Party of Ontario to help Dalton McGuinty and his party in 2002 to be elected into government in the October 2003 election. Axelrod's effect on Ontario was heard through the winning Liberal appeal to \"working families\" and placing an emphasis on positive policy contrasts like canceling corporate tax breaks to fund education and health.\n\nIn 2004, Axelrod worked for John Edwards' presidential campaign. He lost responsibility for making ads, but continued as the campaign's spokesman. Regarding Edwards' failed 2004 presidential campaign, Axelrod has commented, \"I have a whole lot of respect for John, but at some point the candidate has to close the deal and—I can’t tell you why—that never happened with John.\"\n\nAxelrod contributed an op-ed to the \"Chicago Tribune\" in defense of patronage after two top officials in the administration of longtime client Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley were arrested for what federal prosecutors described as \"pervasive fraud\" in City Hall hiring and promotions. In 2006, he consulted for several campaigns, including the successful campaigns of Eliot Spitzer in New York's gubernatorial election and Deval Patrick in Massachusetts's gubernatorial election. Axelrod served in 2006 as the chief political adviser for Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair U.S. Representative Rahm Emanuel for the U.S. House of Representatives elections, in which the Democrats gained 31 seats.\n\nHe was an Adjunct Professor of Communication Studies at Northwestern University, where, along with Professor Peter Miller, he taught an undergraduate class titled Campaign Strategy, analyzing political campaigns, and their strategies. On June 14, 2009 he received an honorary \"Doctor of Humane Letters\" degree from DePaul University, speaking at the commencement exercises of the College of Communication and College of Computing and Digital Media.\n\nAxelrod first met Obama in 1992, when Bettylu Saltzman, a Chicago democrat, introduced the two of them after Obama had impressed her at a black voter registration drive that he ran. Obama consulted Axelrod before he delivered a 2002 anti-war speech, and asked him to read drafts of his book \"The Audacity of Hope\".\n\nAxelrod contemplated taking a break from politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, as five of the candidates—Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Chris Dodd and Tom Vilsack—were past clients. Personal ties between Axelrod and Hillary Clinton made it difficult, as she had raised significant funds for epilepsy on behalf of a foundation co-founded by Axelrod's wife and mother, Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE). (Axelrod's daughter suffers from developmental disabilities associated with chronic epileptic seizures.) Axelrod's wife even said that a 1999 conference Clinton convened to find a cure for the condition was \"one of the most important things anyone has done for epilepsy.\" Axelrod ultimately decided to participate in the Obama campaign, and served as chief strategist and media advisor for Obama. He told \"The Washington Post\", \"I thought that if I could help Barack Obama get to Washington, then I would have accomplished something great in my life.\"\n\nAxelrod contributed to the initial announcement of Obama's campaign by creating a five-minute Internet video released January 16, 2007. He continued to use \"man on the street\"-style biographical videos to create a sense of intimacy and authenticity in the political ads.\nWhile the Clinton campaign chose a strategy that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of \"change.\" He was critical of the Clinton campaign's positioning, and said that \"being the consummate Washington insider is not where you want to be in a year when people want change...[Clinton's] initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands.\" The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. \"Just over half of [Iowa's] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama,\" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. \"That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton.\" Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. \"For all the talent and the money they had over there,\" says Axelrod, \"they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become.\" In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.\n\nAxelrod is credited with implementing a strategy that encourages the participation of people, a lesson drawn partly from Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign as well as a personal goal of Barack Obama. Axelrod explained to \"Rolling Stone\", \"When we started this race, Barack told us that he wanted the campaign to be a vehicle for involving people and giving them a stake in the kind of organizing he believed in. According to Axelrod getting volunteers involved became the legacy of the campaign \" This includes drawing on \"Web 2.0\" technology and viral media to support a grassroots strategy. Obama's web platform allows supporters to blog, create their own personal page, and even phonebank from home. Axelrod's elaborate use of the Internet helped Obama to organize under-30 voters and build over 475,000 donors in 2007, most of whom were Internet donors contributing less than $100 each. The Obama strategy stood in contrast to Hillary Clinton's campaign, which benefited from high name recognition, large donors and strong support among established Democratic leaders.\n\n\"Politico\" described Axelrod as 'soft-spoken' and 'mild-mannered' and it quoted one Obama aide in Chicago as saying, \"Do you know how lucky we are that he is our Mark Penn?\" Democratic consultant and former colleague Dan Fee said of Axelrod, \"He's a calming presence.\" \"He's not a screamer, like some of these guys,\" political advisor Bill Daley said of Axelrod in the \"Chicago Tribune\". \"He has a good sense of humor, so he's able to defuse things.\" In June 2008, \"The New York Times\" described Axelrod as a \"campaign guru\" with an \"appreciation for Chicago-style politics.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2008, Obama named Axelrod as a senior advisor to his administration. His role included crafting policy and communicating the President's message in coordination with President Obama, the Obama Administration, speechwriters, and the White House communications team.\n\nWhen details of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis were publicized in 2010, notably robo-signing, Axelrod was widely criticized for downplaying the magnitude of the crisis in his comments to the press, telling the audience of CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that the Obama administration's \"hope is this moves rapidly and that this gets unwound very, very quickly\" and that he's \"not sure that a national moratorium\" is called for since \"there are in fact valid foreclosures that probably should go forward.\" Notably, Axelrod made this statement after several banks had voluntarily suspended foreclosures and evictions in order to investigate improprieties.\n\nAxelrod left his White House senior advisor post on January 28, 2011. He was a top aide to Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. Axelrod also stated that his job as Obama's chief campaign strategist in the 2012 campaign would be his final job as a political operative.\n\nIn January 2013, Axelrod established a bipartisan Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, where he serves as director. On January 23, 2013, La Stampa reported that Axelrod was helping Italian prime minister Mario Monti with his election campaign and had flown to Italy to meet with Monti ten days earlier. Monti's coalition went on to come fourth with 10.5% of the vote in the Italian general election, 2013. On February 19, 2013, Axelrod joined NBC News and MSNBC as a senior political analyst, a position he held until September 2015 when he moved to CNN.\n\nIn 2014 Axelrod was appointed senior strategic adviser to the British Labour Party to assist party leader Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 general election.\n\nHe is the co-founder of AKPD Message and Media, along with Eric Sedler, and operated ASK Public Strategies, now called ASGK Public Strategies, which were sold in 2009. In Feb. 2015 Axelrod's book \"Believer: My Forty Years in Politics\" was published.\n\nIn 2015, Axelrod began hosting a podcast titled \"The Axe Files,\" a series of in-depth discussions and interviews with various political figures\".\" In June of 2019 he started the podcast \"Hacks on Tap\" with co-host Mike Murphy, a show where the two discuss news and updates from the 2020 presidential campaign trail. He also joined CNN as a senior political commentator in September, 2015.\n\nIn 2018, Axelrod vocally opposed Democratic support for impeachment, arguing that if \"we “normalize” impeachment as a political tool, it will be another hammer blow to our democracy\".\n\n"}

They occurred between May 26 and June 4, 1864, in and around Dallas, Georgia, between Lt. General William J. Hardee's Confederate corps and the Union defense line, held by the XV Corps under Maj. General John A. Logan of the Army of the Tennessee. The Battle of New Hope Church and the Battle of Pickett's Mill are often subgrouped as part of the overall engagement at Dallas.\n\nOn May 24, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, in overall command of the Union forces in Georgia, learned that his Confederate counterpart, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, was forming a defensive line along the south side of Pumpkinvine Creek. After a series of engagements, Johnston's army fell back from the vicinity of Cassville-Kingston, first to Allatoona Pass and then to the Dallas area and entrenched. Sherman's army tested the Rebel line while entrenching themselves. The Battle of Dallas occurred on May 28 when Hardee's Corps probed the Union defensive line, held by Logan's Army of the Tennessee corps, to exploit any weakness or possible withdrawal. Fighting ensued at two different points, but the Rebels were repulsed, suffering high casualties.\n\nSherman continued looking for a way around Johnston's line, and, on June 1, his cavalry occupied Allatoona Pass, which had a railroad and would allow his men and supplies to reach him by train. Sherman abandoned his lines at Dallas on June 5 and moved toward the rail-head at Allatoona Pass, forcing Johnston to follow soon afterwards.\n\nAmong the thousands of casualties was Archibald L. McDougall, a former brigade commander in the Union Army of the Potomac.\n\nThe site of the battle is now Paulding County High School. The Confederate trenches lay along the southern edge of the campus, as marked by a Civil War Marker sign along Highway 61. Through mid-2018, the Civil War Trust, a division of the American Battlefield Trust, and its partners have acquired and preserved 64 acres at the battlefield.\n\n\n"}

The EP was recorded in Maine, United States, during the summer of 2002. \"Arcade Fire\" was remastered and repackaged for its 2005 re-release by Merge Records for fans after they had \"grown obsessed\" with the band's debut album, \"Funeral\". It was initially released in 2003 by the band at their shows and website, and then re-released in 2005 by Merge. It received positive reviews from music critics, although some of them noted that it was inferior to their debut album \"Funeral\". Lyrical themes of \"Arcade Fire\" consist of parents, suburbia, new love, dread, and drama. The EP's third track, \"No Cars Go\", was re-recorded for Arcade Fire's second full-length album, \"Neon Bible\". No Cars Go has been played at the majority of live shows since the EP release. Arcade Fire have also played other songs from the EP, live on every tour since, however, it has become less frequent. On their recent tours, they notably played \"Headlights Look Like Diamonds\" and \"Vampire/Forest Fire\".\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Arcade Fire briefly went to Maine to record the EP, since frontman Win Butler's parents had recently moved there after his father got a land conservatory job. The following year, the band self-released the EP on their website and at their shows. Arcade Fire then met with record labels like Alien8, Absolutely Kosher, and Merge Records to release their debut album \"Funeral\". The band eventually signed with Merge since frontman Win Butler liked bands such as Magnetic Fields and Neutral Milk Hotel who had previously signed with them. Butler said he felt really comfortable with Merge, but denied that there was an \"indie label bidding war\". In 2004, Merge started to release the EP through their website, \"in an attempt to sate the demand of an audience that had quickly grown obsessed with\" \"Funeral\", according to Pitchfork. The next year, Merge remastered and repackaged the EP for stores.\n\nThe opening track \"Old Flame\" has a \"simple\" melody and has a lyrical theme of new love. Scott Reid of Stylus Magazine opined that the song had the band Mercury Rev as an influence, saying it \"is very nearly plagiaristic of half of \"Deserter's Songs\"\". The following track \"I'm Sleeping in a Submarine\" also has the \"joy\" of new love, and it features a chorus consisting of the phrase \"A cage is a cage, is a cage, is a cage!\" \"No Cars Go\", the third track on the EP, was described by Reid as \"easily a demo outtake on [the Broken Social Scene album] \"You Forgot It in People\" \". Allmusic wrote that the song, \"with its driving accordion melody line and unified shouts, sounds like the blueprint for \"Funeral\"'s \"Rebellion (Lies)\".\" It later appeared reworked on Arcade Fire's second album, \"Neon Bible\".\n\nButler's wife Régine Chassagne sings on the song \"The Woodland National Anthem\", and her vocals on the song can be compared to those of Björk. It is a bluesy song with \"campfire percussion\". The next track \"My Heart is an Apple\" features Butler's \"soulful\" vocals and Chassagne's \"childish\" vocals. Reid wrote that \"Headlights Look Like Diamonds\" \"pretty much lifts the entire verse from [the Broken Social Scene song] \"Almost Crimes (Radio Kills Remix)\".\" It features layers of sound continuously being added to the song while Butler sings. At the climax of the song, drums and multi-layered vocals come in, in what Sputnikmusic described as \"frenzied chaos\". The final track, \"Vampire/Forest Fire\" contains lyrical themes of \"parents, suburbia, apathy, and pure, unadulterated emotion.\" In the song, Butler's voice progressively grows louder while keyboards play during its chorus. Pitchfork said the following of the songs: \"while they infuse the songs with a dread and drama that reaches an adolescent intensity and bleeds into every track, they never retreat to a romanticized notion of childhood.\"\n\n\"Arcade Fire\" received positive reviews from critics. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic gave the EP three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying \"While each of the seven tracks contained herein are fully realized, they are as unfocused as they are beautiful, resulting in an intangible, dreamlike atmosphere that reduces each cut – no matter how deep – down to a mere scratch.\" The website named \"Old Flame\", \"No Cars Go\", and \"Vampire/Forest Fire\" the highlights of the EP. Stylus Magazine gave the EP a B+, and wrote that it \"is a strong effort and one of the best 2003 releases everyone seemed to gloss over, but still doesn’t compare to the intense spectacle of their live show.\" \"Kludge\" magazine found the EP's staff ambiguous and not as \"wildly unique\" as the band's later work.\n\nSputnikmusic wrote of the EP \"In order to listen to this properly, I'd say you need the band's first full length album in order to see quite where this led.\" The reviewer recommended \"Arcade Fire\" \"for those who are already fans, and if you aren't (not an option I advise), this should be No. 2 on your shopping list. No prizes for guessing what No. 1 is.\" Pitchfork gave the EP 6.8 out of 10, saying that it \"finds the band still unsure of their capabilities\". The music publication wrote that \"the build-ups seem either less patient or less directed, the quick changes more deliberate, the structures more top-heavy, and the payoffs ultimately less rewarding [than \"Funeral\"]. Reviewer Stephen Deusner did, however, say that \"There are moments that not only hint at the heights of [\"Funeral\"], but scale such heights themselves.\"\n\nThe following people were involved in the making of \"Arcade Fire\":\n"}

This is the second teaming of Powell and Dmytryk (after \"Murder, My Sweet\"). The screenplay was written by John Paxton with uncredited help from Ben Hecht.\n\nAfter the end of World War II a former P.O.W., Canadian RCAF flyer Laurence Gerard (Powell), returns to France to discover who ordered the killing of his bride of only 20 days, a member of the French Resistance. His father-in-law Étienne Rougon identifies Vichy collaborator Marcel Jarnac. He supposedly died in 1943, but Rougon has strong doubts. Jarnac was so careful about maintaining his anonymity, and the police have no description of him. But his own associate compiled a dossier on him; Gerard finds a burned fragment of it, and an envelope addressed to Madame Jarnac. From this he manages to track the widow to Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nWhen he arrives Gerard is met by Melchior Incza (Walter Slezak), a stranger who appears to know all too much about him. The suspicious Canadian initially rejects Incza's offer of help, but cannot turn down his invitation to a party hosted by Mme Jarnac's associate, wealthy businessman Tomas Camargo (Steven Geray) for the opportunity to mingle with their social set. There he meets Camargo's uncle, lawyer Manuel Santana (Morris Carnovsky), and the widow herself (Micheline Cheirel).\n\nWhen Gerard later questions Mme Jarnac in her hotel room, she refuses to co-operate, so he starts openly following her. Santana asks him to desist, but will not say why. Later, Gerard finds a valet, Diego (Jack La Rue), tidying up his hotel room at an odd hour.\n\nEventually, Mme Jarnac agrees to provide him with the information he desires. A note is delivered to Gerard informing him that Jarnac is leaving the country that night under the name of Ernest Dubois, and giving his address; but it is a forgery. Gerard is only stopped from shooting the wrong man in cold blood by the timely intervention of Santana and Diego. Dubois (Edgar Barrier) is actually their associate; it turns out that they are after not only Jarnac but his secret Nazi organisation as well. Mme Jarnac is an innocent woman paid to act as the wife of a man she has never seen.\n\nTo stir things up, Gerard tricks Incza into believing he has the full dossier on Jarnac. Incza breaks into the hotel safe, but it is not there. Gerard is sent to Camargo's room, where Camargo's wife (Nina Vale) keeps him busy by trying to seduce him into her life of luxury and easy vice. Gerard kisses her, but rejects her advance; he still loves his wife, although \"Her teeth were crooked and she was too thin\". He tells the señora he is \"bored\" and cannot wait any longer for Camargo.\n\nMeanwhile, Incza has been searching Gerard's room and realises there is no dossier. When the \"valet\" Diego interrupts, Incza kills him. Gerard returns and is detained as a murder suspect, but a waiter confirms his alibi. Still, Gerard is given 48 hours to leave the country.\n\nWhen Incza tells him that Jarnac will be seeing Camargo at his \"old office\", Gerard decides to stake out a bar Mme Jarnac recalls was once their meeting place. It is a trap. Gerard is captured, and Jarnac (Luther Adler) finally makes his appearance. While they wait for Incza to arrive with the dossier, Jarnac makes a political speech on how America's failure to see that their injustice across the world and the resulting poverty of nations (as happened in Germany after World War I) means that there will always be people like him.\n\nIncza attempts to betray Jarnac to Camargo, before realising Jarnac is there. Hoping to regain Jarnac's trust, he reveals that there is no dossier. Jarnac kills him. Gerard is to die as well, with Camargo as a witness that the two men shot each other. Camargo objects, but Jarnac threatens him with a paper in his possession. Gerard seizes the distraction to overpower Jarnac. He punches Jarnac over and over until Santana and Dubois arrive. To their disappointment, Jarnac is dead, but Gerard shows them the paper detailing Jarnac's connection to Camargo. As Santana now tells the police, this should be sufficient to expose the entire organisation.\n\n\nThe film production involved four men associated with the film who would later be blacklisted in the 1950s: Edward Dmytryk, Adrian Scott, Morris Carnovsky, and Luther Adler. The political argument against Fascism, which reflected the idealistic political views of the four blacklisted filmmakers, is an important part of the film.\n\nThe film made a profit of $413,000.\n\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther lauded the film and the acting, writing,\"Cornered\" is a drama of smoldering vengeance and political scheming which builds purposefully and with graduating tension to a violent climax, a committing of murder that is as thrilling and brutal as any you are likely to encounter in a month of movie-going. The story, which wanders through England, France and Switzerland, eventually centers in Buenos Aires, where apparently all Europe's escaped Fascists are quietly plotting a return to power. Although the narrative is a bit too obviously contrived. Edward Dmytryk, the director, has squeezed every ounce of suspense and excitement out of the material at hand. All of the players are in there pitching with great zest, and Walter Slezak is especially noteworthy as the ruthless and unscrupulous gent around whose flabby bulk most of the intrigue is spun. Micheline Cheirel brings a wistful charm to the role of the mysterious lady who poses as the supposedly deceased collaborationist's wife, and lesser roles are well done by Morris Carnovsky, Jack LaRue and Luther Adler. \"Cornered\" may not be perfect, but it still is a satisfying entertainment.\n\nIn a review of the film, Channel 4 wrote, \"Consolidating his transformation from soft tenor to hard-boiled private eye in Dmytryk's \"Murder My Sweet\" the year before, Powell is even more dour as a tough, cynical loner in search of the man who killed his French wife during the Second World War...The noir atmosphere is sustained well throughout.\"\n\n\"The Classic Film Guide\" calls the film a mess in their review, \"The plot is so confusing, with so many twists and turns, you'll get whiplash trying to keep up, if you're even interested enough to try. Plus, if you've ever read a Robert Ludlum novel (particularly \"The Rhinemann Exchange\"), you'll be sorely disappointed in the intelligence (and one-dimensional nature) of Powell's character, and the route he takes to enact his revenge.\"\n\nWarner Bros. released the film on DVD on July 13, 2010, in its \"Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 5\".\n\n"}

She was a central figure on the world stage of psychoanalysis. Her main interest was in normal childhood development, but she spent much of her time with psychiatric children and how they arrive at the \"self\". Mahler developed the \"separation–individuation theory of child development\".\n\nBorn Margaret Schönberger on May 10, 1897, into a Jewish family in Sopron, a small town in western Hungary, she and a younger sister had a difficult childhood as a result of their parents' troubled marriage. Margaret's father, however, encouraged her to excel in mathematics and other sciences. After completing the High School for Daughters, she attended Vaci Utcai Gimnazium in Budapest, even though it was unusual at the time for a woman to continue formal education. Budapest was of great influence on her life and career. She met the influential Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi, became fascinated by the concept of the unconscious, and was encouraged to read Sigmund Freud.\n\nIn September 1916, she began Art History studies at the University of Budapest, but in January 1917 switched to the Medical School. Three semesters later she began medical training at the University of Munich, but was forced to leave because of tensions toward Jews. In spring 1920 she transferred to the University of Jena and it was there that she began to realize how important play and love were for infants in order for them to grow up mentally and physically healthy. After graduating \"cum laude\" in 1922, she left for Vienna in order to get her license to practice medicine. There she turned from pediatrics to psychiatry and, in 1926, started her training analysis with Helene Deutsch. Seven years later, she was accepted as an analyst. Working with children became her passion. She loved the way the children gave her their attention and showed their joy in cooperating with her.\n\nIn 1936 she married Paul Mahler. Following the Nazis' rise to power, the couple moved to Britain and then, in 1938, to the United States. After receiving a New York medical license, Margaret Mahler set up private practice in a basement and began to rebuild her clientele. In 1939 she met Benjamin Spock and, after giving a child analysis seminar in 1940, she became senior teacher of child analysis. She joined the Institute of Human Development, the Educational Institute and the New York Psychoanalytic Society. In 1948 she worked on clinical studies on Benign and Malignant Cases of Childhood Psychosis.\n\nBarnard College, at its 1980 commencement ceremonies, awarded her its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.\n\nSchönberger Mahler died on October 2, 1985.\n\nMargaret Mahler worked as a psychoanalyst with young disturbed children.\n\nIn 1950 she and Manuel Furer founded the Masters Children's Centre in Manhattan (it was connected with Mount Sinai hospital). There she developed the Tripartite Treatment Model, in which the mother participated in the treatment of the child. Mahler initiated a more constructive exploration of severe disturbances in childhood and emphasized the importance of the environment on the child. She was especially interested in mother-infant duality and carefully documented the impact of early separations of children from their mothers. This documentation of separation-individuation was her most important contribution to the development of psychoanalysis.\n\nSeparation-individuation can be viewed as the psychological birth of an infant, which occurs over a period of time when the child separates from the mother and begins to individuate.\n\nMahler shed light on the normal and abnormal features of the developmental ego psychology. She worked with psychotic children, while psychosis hadn't been covered in the psychoanalytic treatment yet.\n\nSymbiotic child psychosis struck her. The symptomatology she saw as a derailment of the normal processes whereby self-representations (the representation of one's self) and object-representations (the representation of a familiar person) become distinct. Her most important work is \"The Psychological Birth of the Human Infant: Symbiosis and Individuation\", written in 1975 with Fred Pine and Anni Bergman.\n\nIn Mahler's theory, child development takes place in phases, each with several sub phases:\nDisruptions in the fundamental process of separation–individuation can result in a disturbance in the ability to maintain a reliable sense of individual identity in adulthood.\n\nObject constancy, similar to Jean Piaget's object permanence, describes the phase when the child understands that the mother has a separate identity and is truly a separate individual. This leads to the formation of \"internalization\", which is the internal representation that the child has formed of the mother. This Internalization is what provides the child with an image that helps supply them with an unconscious level of guiding support and comfort from their mothers. Deficiencies in positive Internalization could possibly lead to a sense of insecurity and low self-esteem issues in adulthood.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moiré patterns. The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as moiré speedup (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moiré patterns, namely line Glass patterns (after Leon Glass, 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moiré, appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may give rise to magnified shapes, called shape moiré patterns.\n\nSuperimposition (SI) during sound recording and reproduction (commonly called overdubbing) is the process of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some reel-to-reel tape recorders of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the erase head while recording as normal via the read-write head.\n\nIs a forensic technique.\n"}

Most of the game's universe is based on Norse mythology. After entering a closed beta testing phase in 2006 and continuing through 2010 in Korean open beta testing, the game was reworked multiple times due to its poor initial reception. In July 2010 it was announced the entire game had been scrapped, and a new version, \"\", would be developed in its stead. The new iteration of \"Ragnarok Online 2\" returns to the systems and mechanics of the original \"Ragnarok Online\" while keeping the 3D engine.\n\nThe game was first announced at KAMEX (Korea Amuse World Expo) in November 2004. The first trailer of the game was shown during the expo, in which a novice boy and novice girl were running toward each other in an undisclosed 3D city environment.\n\nIn September 2005, Gravity Corp. launched a major campaign to promote the game at the annual Tokyo Game Show. Attendees had the opportunity to play the game for the very first time at Gravity-hosted booths during the three-day event (September 16 to September 18). Gravity released multiple Ragnarok Online II gameplay videos to the public, as well as an animation video, during this time frame.\n\nIn July 2010, Gravity Corp. launched the remake version of Ragnarok Online 2 and change their slogan to . The Closed-beta test will launch in August 2010 and current version of Ragnarok Online 2 will terminate when the remake version launch in close-beta test.\n\nIn December 2006, Gravity finally began accepting applications for the first closed beta test in South Korea. The first closed beta officially ended on December 29, 2006. Application to participate in this beta was made available for a week (during the second week of December, 2006). Over 190,000 applications were submitted but only 2000 were chosen to participate for a period of three days (from December 27 to December 29). Due to several technical issues and server tweaking, the total testing time was only about 10 hours. According to an interview between the Korean newspaper \"Chosun Ilbo\" and developer \"Team Mercury\", the main goal for the first closed beta was to test characters. They wanted to see how gamers would react to the overall feel of the game as well as whether character designs were accepted by them.\n\nFor the second phase of the Korean closed beta, 3,000 users were automatically accepted upon registration and login via the website, with another 5,000 being selected before and on February 22, 2007. The original closed beta testers were also given access to phase two. Towards the end of this phase, a special event invited 10,000 additional players to join testing, leading to a total of 20,000 selected accounts.\n\nThe third phase of the Korean closed beta ran from April 26 to May 5, 2007. It was open for 100,000 registered users as well as those players from the previous closed beta. In order to balance the large amounts of traffic, Gravity opened a second server at the start of the third phase.\n\nThe final phase of testing was the Korean Open Beta running from May 28, 2007 to an unannounced date, where the final release of the game is expected right after. It is open to all Korean citizens with a Korean resident registration number and during the first week, the servers went through severe maintenance as each server quickly filled up. Several more servers were opened shortly after to fit the demand, including several age 18 and up only servers to accommodate those who wish to participate in a player versus player environment. The focus during open beta was game balance and mechanics. The game content is similar to the previous closed betas and it is expected to see a greater release of content in the near future, but most likely after the game is released.\n\nIn 2008, the Korean Open Beta had condensed its number of servers to just two. By this point, the game's population had also seen a dramatic decrease since it first opened in May 2007 - many areas in the game such as Hodemines and Prontera were usually found to be empty.\n\nChanges in Gravity's leadership along with the game being poorly received in Korea during the open beta slowed development on Ragnarok Online II. Gravity since reworked the entire game. Global Business Manager Yunghun Lee said “We launched Ragnarok II in 2007. That version wasn’t really enough for the market, so we tried to revise all the systems, but it takes time. We changed the engine and everything, it’s like a totally new game. The engine changed several times, but now we’re using Gamebryo.”\n\nThe schedule for the launch of Ragnarok Online II was delayed to the fourth quarter of 2010, having originally been scheduled to launch in the first half of the year. However, Gravity decided to postpone the launch in order to improve the game further. The company planned to start commercial service of Ragnarok Online II in Korea in the fourth quarter of 2010 followed later by the other territories where Gravity has already entered into license and distribution agreements.\n“The launch of Ragnarok Online II has been delayed on a number of occasions but we don’t want to launch it before it is ready and want to ensure that it meets the expectations of our players as well as those of our own. We will continue to refine Ragnarok Online II and look forward to providing our users with a high-quality experience.”- Mr. Toshiro Ohno, the President and CEO of Gravity.\nThe game had been in beta testing since May 2007 and was consistently delayed until the announcement was made that the entire game would be rebuilt from the ground up as a true Ragnarok Online sequel. The remake has been named and Ragnarok Online 2: The Gate of the World's service will be terminated on August 2, 2010. The Closed Beta Test for Legend of the Second will start on August 31, and current testers of The Gate of the World will be able to use their beta accounts to gain access to the CBT.\n\nThe year 1000 L.C is approaching. One thousand years prior, a terrible destruction took place, and the world was saved by David Reynaldo Smith Jr.. Roughly twenty years earlier, a destructive war took place between Normans of the east and west, but there has recently been peace. Strange things have begun happening, however; the dark wanderers Dimago have awoken, and the Ellr have left their land of Alfheim to investigate the Mother Tree's silence.\n\nNormans have the ability to freely change jobs out of combat and level each of the jobs independently; progress on a certain job is not lost when switching between jobs. This is accompanied by a flexible stat system where a majority of the stats are based on job so that players are not forced select few jobs by their stat selection. The original Ragnarok Online had only a small amount of stats from jobs with most of them being decided by the player, forcing them along a certain build/playing style.\n\nIn The Gate of the World, certain abilities can be converted into a block and put onto that character's skill grid. This may allow Sword Mastery, a swordsman skill which increases damage dealt with blades to be used to help level another class with a sword. Different abilities have different block shapes and sizes and not all abilities can be shared. Special abilities can be gained by leveling a character's job class, giving them the ability to create useful and original class combinations, such as battle mages and wares-selling thieves.\n\nThere is a limit to how many special abilities one can employ at a time. Characters start with fewer than 16 blocks, but will gradually gain additional blocks as they level.\n\nThe first Ragnarok Online featured a unique leveling system in which a character's base level and job level were leveled separately. However, once a job was chosen, it could not be changed.\n\nRO2 has implemented a new system in which equipment itself levels up. This system allows people to keep their favorite pieces of equipment because they continue being useful instead of tossing them out when they become outdated. When an item has reached enough experience to level up it does not instantly level. It must first be taken to a smith in a town which will then upgrade the weapon for a fee. While the class of weapon will not change, its attributes might. For instance a sword which is suited to combat classes may favor spell-casting classes once it has leveled up.\n\nEquipment in RO2 is separated into two categories: Leveling-type and non-leveling type. The leveling equipment types can gain experience and levels like the player, whereas the non-leveling type doesn't acquire any experience and doesn't level at all.\n\n\"Ragnarok Online 2\" introduces 2 new races The Ellr and the Dimago. Each race has advantages to it that make it a viable choice when a new player is creating their character.\n\nThe Norman race has a human appearance and is the race that was played in RO1. They use the Job System, allowing them to switch their job at will and take advantage of specialty skills. The original appearance of the Norman, a very childish look, was re-designed for a more mature look. The race's name may likely be a reference to the historical Normans or Norsemen, given the game's focus on Norse mythology. It could also be a portmanteau of the words \"normal\" and \"human.\"\n\nThe Ellr are a half-breed, born between an interracial relationship between the Normans and the Elves. They inhabit their own land known as \"Alfheim\". After participating in the war between the eastern and western Normans, they returned to Alfheim, but have recently returned to Midgard to investigate why their \"Mother Tree\" fell silent. The power of an Ellr comes from the magical stones they possess, called \"Stones of Ancestors\". These stones influence their skills, and as such the Ellr has no professions or classes. They may only equip two stones at a time, however. The original model of the concept Ellr appeared as a super deformed art style. It was later redesigned to appear more normal in proportions, although still very childlike.\n\nThe Dimago are the rejected offspring of a relationship between the Colossus and Norman. They have apparently been under an enchanted sleep, and have no memory of their previous lives. They \"fight with style\" and are able to make use of dynamic skill trees. The characters are designed to be 7-8 heads tall in height (that of an average human). This, compared to the Ellr, which are 2~3 heads tall, or the Normans, which are 4~6 heads tall, means that the Dimago will be the tallest playable race in the game.\n\n"}

It is in the ZIP code area of 96051 and the area code 530.\n\nArising along the route of the Siskiyou Trail, Portuguese Flat, with its rich diggings, gained the reputation of being one of the roughest camps in northern Shasta County; it was also known as a \"squaw town\" because of the number of Native American women present in the town. By the time of the 1885 census, it appears that the site was deserted.\n\nAs late as 1933, just north of Pollard's Gulch on what is now Interstate 5, one could see a few old tumbledown buildings, one ancient log cabin, and some veteran apple trees — all that remained of Portuguese Flat.

Arbuckle professor of business at Harvard Business School. She is also director and chair of the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative.\n\nKanter was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Helen (Smolen) Moss, a schoolteacher, and Nelson Nathan Moss, a lawyer and small-business owner. She has a younger sister, Myra. Kanter described her childhood as \"benign\" and herself as ambitious, having written a novel and entered essay contests as early as 11 years old.\n\nShe graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in 1960 and then went on to study sociology and English literature at Bryn Mawr College, graduating \"magna cum laude\" in 1964. The following year she received an MA in sociology and, in 1967, a PhD from the University of Michigan. Her dissertation was on 19th-century utopian communes. Although Kanter later decided to pursue a career in business research, her training as a sociologist informed her thinking and subsequent work.\n\nBefore joining the Harvard Business School faculty, Kanter was assistant professor of sociology at Brandeis University from 1967 to 1973 and again from 1974 to 1977, visiting associate professor of administration at Harvard University, as well as professor of sociology at Yale University from 1977 to 1986. She served as editor of the \"Harvard Business Review\" from 1989 to 1992, the last academic to hold the job. She is Chair and Director of the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative.\n\nKanter's earliest work as a sociologist focused on utopian communities and communes in the United States. In her 1972 book, \"Commitment & Community: Communes and Utopias in Sociological Perspective\", she argued that the internal characteristics of a utopian community lead to its success or failure. Kanter defined a \"successful\" commune as one that lasted for longer than thirty-three years. After surveying ninety-one communal projects from the period between 1780 and 1860, she determined that communal groups such as the Shakers, Amana, and Oneida were among the most successful nineteenth-century communes. To explain their success, Kanter noted these groups' rituals and clear boundaries for membership, as well as the \"commitment mechanisms\" that utopians utilized: sacrifice, investment, renunciation, communion, mortification and transcendence. She concluded that the more that a utopian community asked of its members, the more cohesive and long-lasting it was.\n\nKanter has written numerous books on business management techniques, particularly change management; she also has a regular column in the \"Miami Herald\". She is known for her 1977 study of tokenism—how being a minority in a group can affect one's performance due to enhanced visibility and performance pressure. Her study of \"Men and Women of the Corporation\" is a classic in critical management studies, bureaucracy analysis and gender studies.\n\nShe was an economic adviser to Michael Dukakis in his 1988 bid for presidency. Together they wrote a book entitled \"Creating the future: the Massachusetts comeback and its promise for America\", an examination of the Massachusetts Miracle.\n\nKanter co-founded the consulting firm Goodmeasure Inc. and has served as its chair since 1980. Her consulting clients have included large companies such as IBM, Gap Inc., Monsanto, British Airways, and Volvo.\n\nKanter was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975 and the Harvard Business Review's \"McKinsey Award\" in 1979. Her book \"Men and Women of the Corporation\" won the 1977 C. Wright Mills Award for the year's outstanding book on social issues. In 2001, she received the \"Scholarly Contributions to Management Award\" by the Academy of Management and, one year later, the Intelligent Community Forum's \"Intelligent Community Visionary of the Year Award\". She holds 23 honorary degrees from various colleges and universities. Her first honorary degree was awarded to her in 1978 by Yale University and her most recent, 23rd degree comes from Aalborg University in Denmark.\n\nThe \"Rosabeth Moss Kanter Award\" is given in recognition of the best piece of work-family research. The award was created by the Center for Families at Purdue University and the Center for Work and Family at Boston College in honor of Kanter.\n\nShe was the top-ranking woman—No. 11 overall—in a 2002 study of Top Business Intellectuals by citation in several sources. She was named one of the \"50 most powerful women in Boston\" by Boston Magazine and one of the \"125 women who changed our world\" over the past 125 years by \"Good Housekeeping\" magazine in May 2010.\n\nKanter's first husband, Stuart A. Kanter, whom she had married in her junior year at Bryn Mawr, died in 1969. She married consultant Berry Stein in 1972. Together they have one son.\n\nBusiness.com described Rosabeth Kanter's theory of management as establishing a framework managers can utilize to enhance the efficiency of corporate organizations. One of her theories suggested the manner by which a company operates influences attitudes of the work force. Kanter says employees show a variety of behaviors depending on whether structural support was in position. Her view is power emanates from informal and formal sources. Employees must have access to available resources to accomplish the organization’s objectives. It is also essential to promote the staff's skills and comprehension.\n\nOne article in Management Today cited Rosabeth Kanter as “\"probably the first woman to attain indisputable management guru status\".” Aside from her expertise in change management, Kanter has interests in corporate strategies, self-confidence, and demographic shift. She has a fondness for conducting detailed research therefore earning the pseudonym, “The Thinking Woman’s Michael Porter.”\n\nAn article published in the San Diego Tribune on May 29, 2018, mentioned the Harvard professor’s idea the happiest employees can solve the most difficult problems and make a positive change in the lives of people. Teachers must adopt this stance if they want to stay in the teaching profession for many years.\n\nIn an interview with the Business Insider in 2015, Professor Kanter deplored the “miserable state of America’s infrastructure which impaired the economy and affected American citizens. According to the management expert, the blame must be put on federal and local politicians as well as Americans who elect them. Kanter emphasized the need for citizens to pay their taxes in sales, tourism, and usage. Likewise, it is imperative to market investments in infrastructure effectively. However, it is not the government’s job alone in building and promoting infrastructure. Entrepreneurs, technology, and collaboration between the public and private sectors are also important.\n\n\n"}

She was a member of both the San Francisco Opera Company and the San Francisco Children's Opera Company. She graduated from Hollywood High School in 1942. Following graduation, she returned to San Francisco to attend college. She also worked with two theater groups there.\n\nBefore she became an actress, Raymond was a photographers' model. She told author Leo Verswijver \"I got started modeling at $25 an hour and [I] forgot all about acting, because I was earning a living.\" Her work included posing for the cover of \"True Confessions\" magazine.\n\nRaymond's first acting role was playing Bettina Bowman in \"Keep Smiling\" (1938), credited as Paula Rae Wright. In 1950, she was put under contract by MGM, where she played opposite leading men such as Cary Grant and Dick Powell. Earlier in her career, Raymond acted in film noir thrillers such as \"City That Never Sleeps\" (with Gig Young, Mala Powers and Marie Windsor), and later in her career, she acted in horror films.\n\nIn 1952, she played the heroine in \"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\".

She was noted as saying of this: \"I didn't want to play a woman who worked in a saloon, week after week. I have a freckle on my face, and I sometimes put a beauty mark over it. They even put it on Amanda Blake, who finally got the part—although it was put on the opposite side from mine. I wanted them to soften the character but didn't think they’d do it. As it turned out, the character wasn't a trashy woman at all. She was just the type I would have liked to have played\".\n\nRaymond appeared in a 1959 episode \"The Paymaster\" of the ABC/Desilu western series \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\".

In 1984, she broke both hips, and in 1994, she broke her shoulder.\n\nIn 1944, Raymond married Floyd Leroy Patterson.

He played more than 100 times for Wales and six times for the British and Irish Lions.\n\nJones was the record cap holder for Wales until he was overtaken by Gethin Jenkins on 15 March 2014. He remains as Wales most-capped back. With more than 900 points, Jones is sixth in the List of leading rugby union test point scorers, and the second-highest Wales player on the list behind Neil Jenkins.\n\nAt the end of the 2012–13 season, Jones retired from playing professional rugby to take up a coaching position at London Wasps and in August 2015 he joined the Scarlets as backs coach.\n\nJones was born in Aberystwyth. He joined Llanelli RFC in 1996, staying there until the 2003–04 season. He played his last Welsh club season for the Llanelli Scarlets, the Llanelli side in the Welsh regional setup introduced that year. In his Welsh top-level career, he made more than 200 appearances and scored almost 2,000 points.\n\nIn 2004, he joined Clermont Auvergne, formerly known as Montferrand.\nHe had a successful club career with Clermont and he was chosen by French journalists as the fly-half of the season in his second year at the club.\n\nAfter two years at Clermont he returned to play for the Scarlets in 2006. Back in Llanelli, Jones and the team had an excellent run in the Heineken Cup in 2007 and reached the semi-finals after wins home and away against Ulster and Toulouse, and a comfortable home victory against 2006 winners Munster in the quarter-finals. The Scarlets ultimately came unstuck against Leicester in the semi-final.\n\nJones ended speculation over his future by signing a new three-year contract with the Scarlets. He had been heavily linked with a move to French club Biarritz after triggering a clause in his contract allowing him to talk to other clubs.\n\nOn 11 April 2012, it was announced that Jones would be leaving the Scarlets for a second time to join London Wasps at the end of the 2011–12 season. He agreed to a two-year contract that could see him move into a coaching role at the end of his playing career. In February 2013, Jones announced that he would retire from playing a year early, at the end of the 2012–13 season, and move into coaching with Wasps.\n\nOn 12 January 2015, it was announced that Jones would be returning to Scarlets at the end of the 2014-15 season as backs coach.\n\nJones made his international debut for Wales in 1998 against South Africa.\n\nJones played a prominent role in Wales' Grand Slam triumph of 2005. As a fly-half, he scored the majority of the team's points, his best game being the victory in Paris, in which he scored 14 points including a drop goal and made a 60-metre break that led to Martyn Williams' first try. In the championship decider against Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, he scored another 16 points and steered Wales to their first Grand Slam for 27 years. He was later named fly-half of the championship for 2005.\n\nIn October 2006 head coach Gareth Jenkins named Jones as captain to lead Wales through to the 2007 World Cup. On his appointment of Jones, Jenkins said \"Stephen has all the attributes to make a magnificent captain of his country. He has the respect and regard of his players, leadership qualities that are evident for all to see and the talent and ability to lead from the front at game time\".\nJenkins had a change of heart however, as Jones was replaced by Gareth Thomas as captain for the tournament itself, as Jones was not assured of his place in the Welsh team due to the emergence of James Hook. In his eight outings as Wales captain, Jones led Wales to only one win with six defeats and one draw.\nIn the 2008 RBS Six Nations, Jones made four appearances in his second Grand Slam championship win with Wales. He scored seven conversions and 10 penalties, adding up to 44 points, despite starting the tournament as second choice to James Hook.\n\nIn the 2009 RBS Six Nations, Jones made five appearances in the competition with Wales. An improvement to the previous year's competition he proved to be the in-form player, cementing his place as the first-choice number 10 for Wales. Jones almost prevented Ireland from winning the Grand Slam in the last minute of the final game of the tournament, but his 50-yard penalty kick fell short.\n\nJones became the record cap holder for Wales on 26 September 2011 versus Namibia, overtaking the record of 100 caps set by Gareth Thomas.\n\nJones was selected as part of the 30-man Welsh squad for the Rugby World Cup 2011. He played his 103rd Test against France in the semi-final which Wales lost, coming off the bench to replace James Hook in the 45th minute. His 104th and final cap came in the third-place play-off match against Australia on 21 October 2011.\n\nHaving been part of the Wales team that won the 2005 Six Nations Championship Grand Slam with Wales, Jones was the in-form fly-half selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. With four fly-halves in the squad, Jones was involved in just two of the tour matches, starting against the New Zealand Māori and replacing Jonny Wilkinson against Wellington. For the first Test, both Jones and Wilkinson were selected in the starting line-up ahead of Ronan O'Gara and Charlie Hodgson, with Jones at fly-half and Wilkinson at inside centre; however, Jones lost his place in the team for the second Test, with Wilkinson taking over at fly-half. Having lost both of the first two matches, Sir Clive Woodward restored Jones to the starting line-up for the dead rubber third Test, in which he scored 14 points as the Lions lost 38–19. Woodward's decision to select Wilkinson ahead of Jones was questioned by the media, many of whom doubted whether the English fly-half should even have been picked for the tour, having only recently recovered from a serious shoulder injury.\n\nOn 21 April 2009, Jones was named in the squad for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. During 2009, Jones cemented his place as Wales' first-choice number 10 and earned his place in the Lions squad. He started all three Tests and broke the Lions record for most points scored against South Africa in the second Test.\n\nJones has a son, Seb Joseff Jones, who was born to his fiancée Gwen at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, on 8 July 2011. At the 2014 National Eisteddfod in Llanelli, Jones was honoured by the Gorsedd of Bards for services to Wales.\n\nA Welsh speaker, Jones is one of several players to have been featured in the S4C series \"Rygbi a Mwy\".\n\n\n"}

Of Scottish descent, she was born in Melbourne but is best known for her activities in South Australia. Together with the Reverend Julian Tenison-Woods, she founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (the Josephites), a congregation of religious sisters that established a number of schools and welfare institutions throughout Australia and New Zealand, with an emphasis on education for the rural poor.\n\nThe process to have MacKillop declared a saint began in the 1920s, and she was beatified in January 1995 by Pope John Paul II. Pope Benedict XVI prayed at her tomb during his visit to Sydney for World Youth Day 2008 and in December 2009 approved the Catholic Church's recognition of a second miracle attributed to her intercession. She was canonised on 17 October 2010, during a public ceremony in St Peter's Square at the Vatican. She is the first Australian to be recognised by the Catholic Church as a saint. Mary MacKillop is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane.\n\nMary Helen MacKillop was born on 15 January 1842 in what is now the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Victoria (at the time part of an area called Newtown in the then British colony of New South Wales), to Alexander MacKillop and Flora MacDonald. Although she continued to be known as \"Mary\", when she was baptised six weeks later she received the names Maria Ellen.\n\nMacKillop's parents lived in Roybridge, Inverness-shire, Scotland, prior to emigrating to Australia. Others on both sides of the family had emigrated previously. MacKillop visited the village in the 1870s where the local Catholic church, St Margaret's, now has a shrine to her.\n\nMacKillop's father, Alexander MacKillop, born in Perthshire. He began his studies for the priesthood at age twelve, and two years later went to the Scots College in Rome; he also studied at Blairs College in Kincardineshire, but at the age of 29 left, just before he was due to be ordained. He migrated to Australia and arrived in Sydney in 1838. MacKillop's mother, Flora MacDonald, born in Fort William, had left Scotland and arrived in Melbourne in 1840. Her father and mother married in Melbourne on 14 July 1840. MacKillop was the eldest of their eight children. Her younger siblings were Margaret (\"Maggie\", 1843–1872), John (1845–1867), Annie (1848–1929), Alexandrina (\"Lexie\", 1850–1882), Donald (1853–1925), Alick (who died at 11 months old) and Peter (1857–1878). Donald became a Jesuit priest and worked among the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Lexie became a member of the Good Shepherd Sisters in Melbourne.\n\nMacKillop was educated at private schools and by her father. She received her First Holy Communion on 15 August 1850 at the age of nine. In February 1851, Alexander MacKillop left his family behind after having mortgaged the farm and their livelihood and made a trip to Scotland lasting some 17 months. Throughout his life he was a loving father and husband but not successful as either a farmer or gold prospector. Consequently the family faced many hardships.\n\nMacKillop started work at the age of 16 as a clerk in a stationery store in Melbourne. To provide for her needy family, in 1860 she took a job as governess at the estate of her aunt and uncle, Alexander and Margaret MacKillop Cameron in Penola, South Australia where she was to look after their children and teach them. Already set on helping the poor whenever possible, she included the other farm children on the Cameron estate as well. This brought her into contact with Fr Julian Tenison-Woods, who had been the parish priest in the south east since his ordination to the priesthood in 1857 after completing his studies at Sevenhill.\n\nMacKillop stayed for two years with the Camerons before accepting a job teaching the children of Portland, Victoria in 1862. Later she taught at the Portland school and after opening her own boarding school, Bay View House Seminary for Young Ladies, now Bayview College, in 1864, was joined by the rest of her family.\n\nIn 1866, Julian Tenison-Woods invited MacKillop and her sisters Annie and Lexie to come to Penola and to open a Catholic school. Woods was appointed director of education and became the founder, along with MacKillop, of a school they opened in a stable there. After renovations by their brother, the MacKillops started teaching more than 50 children. At this time MacKillop made a declaration of her dedication to God and began wearing black.\n\nOn 21 November 1866, the feast day of the Presentation of Mary, several other women joined MacKillop and her sisters. MacKillop adopted the religious name of \"Sister Mary of the Cross\" and she and Lexie began wearing simple religious habits. The small group began to call themselves the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and moved to a new house in Grote Street, Adelaide. There they founded a new school at the request of the bishop, Laurence Bonaventure Sheil OFM. \n\nThe \"rule of life\" developed by Woods and MacKillop for the community emphasised poverty, a dependence on divine providence, no ownership of personal belongings, faith that God would provide and willingness to go where needed. The rule of life was approved by Bishop Sheil. By the end of 1867, ten other women had joined the Josephites, who adopted a plain brown religious habit. Due to the colour of their attire and their name, the Josephite sisters became colloquially known as the \"Brown Joeys\".\n\nIn an attempt to provide education to all the poor, particularly in rural areas, a school was opened in Yankalilla, South Australia, in October 1867. By the end of 1869, more than 70 members of the Sisters of St Joseph were educating children at 21 schools in Adelaide and the country. MacKillop and her Josephites were also involved with an orphanage; neglected children; girls in danger; the aged poor; a reformatory (in Johnstown near Kapunda); and a home for the aged and incurably ill. Generally, the Josephite sisters were prepared to follow farmers, railway workers and miners into the isolated outback and live as they lived.\n\nIn December 1869, MacKillop and several other sisters travelled to Brisbane to establish the order in Queensland. They were based at Kangaroo Point and took the ferry or rowed across the Brisbane River to attend Mass at St Stephen's Cathedral. Two years later, she was in Port Augusta, South Australia for the same purpose. The Josephite congregation expanded rapidly and, by 1871, 130 sisters were working in more than 40 schools and charitable institutions across South Australia and Queensland.\n\nMacKillop clashed with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn, over the control of the many schools she established; MacKillop believed the sisters should control the schools while Quinn believed the diocese should control them. In 1879, relationships between them had deteriorated to the point that Quinn directed the sisters to leave his diocese. Despite protests by the laity, Quinn was determined and MacKillop and her Josephite sisters had left the diocese by mid-1880 with other Catholic orders taking over the operation of their schools. When the Diocese of Rockhampton was excised from the Brisbane diocese on 29 December 1882, it enabled MacKillop and her sisters to return to Queensland, where they established a school in Clermont and then in other places within the new diocese.\n\nIn 1881, Elzear Torreggiani, then Bishop of Armidale and a Capuchin who had worked in both North Wales at Pantasaph and London at Peckham, prior to being consecrated in London in 1879, for the Armidale Diocese; established Mother Mary MacKillop's Sisters of St Joseph at Tenterfield and defended their power of central government at the 1885 Plenary Council. \n\nDuring the time Torreggiani was Bishop of Armidale the Sisters of St Joseph established foundations at Tenterfield (1880), Inverell (1880), Narrabri (1882), Glen Innes (1883), Uralla (1886), Quirindi (1888), Hillgrove (1889), Tingha (1890), Bingara (1902), Walgett (1902), Warialda (1904) and Manilla (1904). Subsequently the sisters established Bundarra (1908), Barraba (1910), Boggabri (1911), Tamworth West (1919), Dungowan (1930), Tamworth South (1954) Lightning Ridge (1980) Mungindi (1995) and Attunga (1995). Wee Waa and Werris Creek were also \"Motor Mission\" centres.\n\nBishop Sheil spent less than two years of his episcopate in Adelaide and his absences and poor health left the diocese effectively without clear leadership for much of his tenure. This resulted in bitter factionalism within the clergy and disunity among the lay community. After the founding of the Josephites, Sheil appointed Woods as director general of Catholic education. Woods came into conflict with some of the clergy over educational matters and local clergy began a campaign to discredit the Josephites. As well as allegations of financial incompetence, rumours were also spread that MacKillop had a drinking problem. A 2010 investigation by the Revd Paul Gardiner, chaplain of the Mary MacKillop Penola Centre, found no evidence to support these allegations. In fact, it was widely known that she drank alcohol on doctor's orders to relieve the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, which often led to her being bedridden for days at a time.\n\nIn early 1870, MacKillop and her sister Josephites heard of allegations that Father Patrick Keating, of Kapunda parish to Adelaide's north, had been sexually abusing children. The Josephites informed Father Woods, who in turn informed the vicar general, Father John Smyth, who ultimately sent Keating back to Ireland. The reason for Keating's dismissal was publicly thought to be alcohol abuse. Keating's former Kapunda colleague, Father Charles Horan OFM, was angered by Keating's removal and there is evidence to suggest he sought revenge against Woods by attacking the Josephites. Horan became acting vicar general after the death of Smyth in June 1870 and from this position sought to influence Bishop Sheil. Horan met with Sheil on 21 September 1871 and convinced him that the Josephites' constitution should be changed in a way that could have left the Josephite nuns homeless; the following day, when MacKillop apparently did not accede to the request, Sheil excommunicated her, citing insubordination as the reason. Candid coverage in the Catholic newspaper \"The Irish Harp and Farmers' Herald\" earned for its editor C. J. Fox ostracism and expulsion from the Catholic Association of which he was president.\n\nThough the Josephites were not disbanded, most of their schools were closed in the wake of this action. Forbidden to have contact with anyone in the church, MacKillop was given the rent-free use of two houses in Flinders Street, Adelaide by prominent Jewish merchant Emanuel Solomon and was also sheltered by Jesuit priests. Some of the sisters chose to remain under diocesan control, becoming popularly known as \"Black Joeys\".\n\nOn his deathbed, Sheil instructed Horan to lift the excommunication on MacKillop. On 21 February 1872, he met her on his way to Willunga and absolved her in the Morphett Vale church. An episcopal commission later completely exonerated her.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said in September 2010 that MacKillop had been \"banished after uncovering sex abuse\" and cited Father Paul Gardiner in evidence of this. Gardiner described this suggestion as false, saying \"Early in 1870, the scandal occurred and the Sisters of Saint Joseph reported it to Father Tenison Woods, but Mary was in Queensland and no one was worried about her.\" The executive producer of the ABC documentary said that the documentary did not suggest that MacKillop was excommunicated because of her role in exposure of child abuse: \"At no stage ... is it claimed Mary MacKillop was excommunicated because she personally reported instances of abuse to the Catholic Church.\"\n\nAfter the acquisition of the Mother House in Kensington in 1872, MacKillop made preparations to leave for Rome to have the \"Rule of Life\" of the Sisters of St Joseph officially approved.\n\nMacKillop travelled to Rome in 1873 to seek papal approval for the religious congregation and was encouraged in her work by Pope Pius IX. The authorities in Rome made changes to the way Josephite sisters lived in regards to their commitment to poverty and declared that the superior general and her council were the authorities in charge of the congregation. They assured MacKillop that the congregation and their \"Rule of Life\" would receive final approval after a trial period. The resulting alterations to the \"Rule of Life\" regarding ownership of property caused a breach between MacKillop and Woods, who felt that the revised document compromised the ideal of vowed poverty and blamed MacKillop for not getting the document accepted in its original form. Before Woods' death on 7 October 1889, he and MacKillop were personally reconciled, but he did not renew his involvement with the congregation.\n\nWhile in Europe, MacKillop travelled widely to observe educational methods.\n\nDuring this period, the Josephites expanded their operations into New South Wales and New Zealand. MacKillop relocated to Sydney in 1883 on the instruction of Bishop Reynolds of Adelaide.\n\nWhen MacKillop returned to Australia in January 1875, after an absence of nearly two years, she brought approval from Rome for her sisters and the work they did, materials for her school, books for the convent library, several priests and most of all, 15 new Josephites from Ireland. Regardless of her success, she still had to contend with the opposition of priests and several bishops. This did not change after her unanimous election as superior general in March 1875.\n\nThe Josephites were unusual among Catholic church ministries in two ways. Firstly, the sisters lived in the community rather than in convents. Secondly the congregation's constitutions required administration by a superior general chosen from within the congregation rather than by the bishop, which was uncommon in its day. However, the issues which caused friction were that the Josephites refused to accept government funding, would not teach instrumental music (then considered an essential part of education by the church) and were unwilling to educate girls from more affluent families. This structure resulted in the sisters being forced to leave Bathurst in 1876 and Queensland by 1880 due to the local bishops' refusal to accept this working structure.\n\nNotwithstanding all the trouble, the congregation did expand. By 1877, it operated more than 40 schools in and around Adelaide, with many others in Queensland and New South Wales. With the help from Benson, Barr Smith, the Baker family, Emanuel Solomon and other non-Catholics, the Josephites, with MacKillop as their leader and superior general, were able to continue the religious and other good works, including visiting prisoners in jail.\n\nAfter the appointment of Roger Vaughan as Archbishop of Sydney in 1877, life became a little easier for MacKillop and her sisters. Until his death in 1882, the Revd Joseph Tappeiner had given MacKillop his solid support and, until 1883, she also had the support of Bishop Reynolds of Adelaide.\n\nAfter the death of Vaughan in 1883, Patrick Francis Moran became archbishop. Although he had a somewhat positive outlook toward the Josephites, he removed MacKillop as superior general and replaced her with Sister Bernard Walsh.\n\nPope Leo XIII gave official approval to the Josephites as a congregation in 1885, with its headquarters in Sydney.\n\nOn 31 May 1886, Mary MacKillop's mother, Flora MacKillop was travelling from Melbourne to Sydney in the SS Ly-ee-Moon, to visit Mary and another daughter who was also a nun. The ship struck a reef near the Green Cape Lighthouse. Flora, along with 70 others, died.\n\nPope Leo XIII gave the final approval to the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart in 1888.\n\nAlthough still living through alms, the Josephite sisters had been very successful. In South Australia, they had schools in many country towns including, Willunga, Willochra, Yarcowie, Mintaro, Auburn, Jamestown, Laura, Sevenhill, Quorn, Spalding, Georgetown, Robe, Pekina, Appila and several others. MacKillop continued her work for the Josephites in Sydney and tried to provide as much support as possible for those in South Australia. In 1883 the order was successfully established at Temuka in New Zealand, where MacKillop stayed for over a year. In 1889 it was also established in the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nDuring all these years MacKillop assisted Mother Bernard with the management of the Sisters of St Joseph. She wrote letters of support, advice and encouragement or just to keep in touch. By 1896, MacKillop was back in South Australia, visiting fellow sisters in Port Augusta, Burra, Pekina, Kapunda, Jamestown and Gladstone. That same year, she travelled again to New Zealand, spending several months in Port Chalmers and Arrowtown in Otago. During her time in New Zealand with the Sisters of St Joseph, a school was established in Arrowtown, near Queenstown, South Island. Located in the grounds of St Patrick's Church, the small yellow cottage now known as Mary MacKillop cottage was originally built as a miner's house around 1870. It was bought by the church and incorporated into the church school in 1882 and then in 1897, Sister Mary MacKillop had the cottage and some of the school converted to a convent for the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart who worked in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIn 1897, Bishop Maher of Port Augusta arranged for the Sisters of St Joseph to take charge of the St Anacletus Catholic Day School at Petersburg (now Peterborough).\nMacKillop founded a convent and base for the Sisters of St Joseph in Petersburg on 16 January 1897. \"On January 16th, 1897, the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Mother Mary of the Cross, arrived in Petersburg to take over the school. She was accompanied by Sister Benizi (who was placed in charge of the school), Sister M. Joseph, Sister Clotilde and Sister Aloysius Joseph. They were met at the station by Rev. Father Norton who took them to the newly blessed convent, purchased for them on Railway Terrace.\" The property at 40 Railway Terrace is identified as the convent by a plaque placed by the Catholic diocese of Peterborough.\n\nAfter the death of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as superior general in 1899, a position she held until her own death. During the later years of her life she had many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism and after a stroke in Auckland, New Zealand in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years, she had to rely on a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write with her left hand. Even after suffering the stroke, the Josephite nuns had enough confidence in her to re-elect her in 1905.\n\nMacKillop died on 8 August 1909 at the Josephite convent in North Sydney. The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, said: \"I consider this day to have assisted at the deathbed of a saint.\" She was laid to rest at the Gore Hill cemetery, a few kilometres up the Pacific Highway from North Sydney.\n\nAfter MacKillop's burial, people continually took earth from around her grave. As a result, her remains were exhumed and transferred on 27 January 1914 to a vault before the altar of the Virgin Mary in the newly built memorial chapel in Mount Street, North Sydney. The vault was a gift of Joanna Barr Smith, a lifelong friend and admiring Presbyterian.\n\nIn 1925, the Mother Superior of the Sisters of St Joseph, Mother Laurence, began the process to have MacKillop declared a saint and Michael Kelly, Archbishop of Sydney, established a tribunal to carry the process forward. The process for MacKillop's beatification began in 1926, was interrupted in 1931 but began again in April 1951 and was closed in September of that year. After several years of hearings, close examination of MacKillop's writings and a 23-year delay, the initial phase of investigations was completed in 1973. \nA longtime and prominent non-Catholic promoter of her cause was poet-bookseller Max Harris.\nAfter further investigations, MacKillop's \"heroic virtue\" was declared in 1992. That same year, the church endorsed the belief that Veronica Hopson, apparently dying of leukaemia in 1961, was cured by praying for MacKillop's intercession; MacKillop was beatified on 19 January 1995 by Pope John Paul II. For the occasion of the beatification, the Croatian-Australian artist Charles Billich was commissioned to paint MacKillop's official commemorative.\n\nOn 19 December 2009, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a papal decree formally recognising a second miracle, the complete and permanent cure of Kathleen Evans of inoperable lung and secondary brain cancer in the 1990s. Kathleen Evans went on to publish in 2012 with Penguin Books, \"The Story Behind Saint Mary MacKillop's second Miracle.\" Her canonisation was announced on 19 February 2010 and subsequently took place on 17 October 2010. This made her the first Australian to be recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn the week leading up to her canonisation, the Australian federal government announced that it was protecting the use of MacKillop's name for commercial purposes. According to a statement from the office of the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, the only other individual Australian whose name has similar protection is Australian cricket legend Sir Donald Bradman. Australia Post issued an official postage stamp to recognise MacKillop's canonisation.\nAn estimated 8,000 Australians were present in Vatican City to witness the ceremony. The Vatican Museum held an exhibition of Aboriginal art to honour the occasion titled \"Rituals of Life\". The exhibition contained 300 artifacts which were on display for the first time since 1925.\n\nAlong with MacKillop, sainthood was also approved for Saint André Bessette, a Canadian Holy Cross Brother; Stanisław Kazimierczyk, a 15th-century Polish priest; Italian nuns Giulia Salzano and Camilla Battista da Varano; and Spanish nun Candida Maria of Jesus.\n\nMacKillop is remembered in numerous ways, particularly in Australia. Many things have been named for her, including the electoral district of MacKillop in South Australia and several MacKillop colleges. In 1985, the Sisters of St Joseph approached one of Australia's foremost rose growers to develop the Mary MacKillop Rose. MacKillop was the subject of the first of the \"Inspirational Australians\" one dollar coin series, released by the Royal Australian Mint in 2008.\n\nSeveral Australian composers have written sacred music to celebrate Mary MacKillop. In 2009 Nicholas Buc was commissioned by the Shire of Glenelg to write an hour-long cantata mass for the centenary of the death of Mary MacKillop. It was premiered by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic in Portland, Victoria. The \"Mass of Mary McKillop\" is a setting for congregational singing, composed by Joshua Cowie. Hymns specifically used in St Mary of the Cross celebrations including \"A Saint for Today\" and \"Mary MacKillop, Woman of Australia\" by Josephite Sister Margaret Cusack, and \"If I Could Tell The Love of God\", \"In Love God Leads Us\" and \"Psalm 103\" by Jesuit Priest Christopher Willcock.\n\nMacKillop is also the subject of several artistic productions, including the 1994 film \"Mary\", directed by Kay Pavlou with Lucy Bell as MacKillop; \"Her Holiness\", a play by Justin Fleming; and \"MacKillop\", a dramatic musical created by Victorian composer Xavier Brouwer and first performed for pilgrims at World Youth Day 2008 in Melbourne. Novelist Pamela Freeman's \"The Black Dress\" is a fictionalised biography of MacKillop's childhood and young adulthood.\n\nIn 2000, the State Transit Authority named a SuperCat ferry after MacKillop. In 2008, a railway bridge in Adelaide was named Mary MacKillop Bridge.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2060821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060821", "title": "Flashback (psychology)", "text": "Flashback (psychology)\n\nA flashback, or involuntary recurrent memory, is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual has a sudden, usually powerful, re-experiencing of a past experience or elements of a past experience. These experiences can be happy, sad, exciting, or of any other emotion one can consider. The term is used particularly when the memory is recalled involuntarily, and/or when it is so intense that the person \"relives\" the experience, unable to fully recognize it as memory and not something that is happening in \"real time\".\n\nFlashbacks are the \"personal experiences that pop into your awareness, without any conscious, premeditated attempt to search and retrieve this memory\". These experiences occasionally have little to no relation to the situation at hand. Flashbacks to those suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can significantly disrupt everyday life.\n\nMemory is divided into voluntary (conscious) and involuntary (unconscious) processes that function independently of each other. Theories and research on memory dates back to Hermann Ebbinghaus, who began studying nonsense syllables. Ebbinghaus classified three distinct classes of memory: sensory, short-term, and long-term memory.\n\n\nMiller (1962–1974) declared that studying such fragile things as involuntary memories should not be done. This appears to have been followed, since very little research has been done on flashbacks in the cognitive psychology discipline. Flashbacks have been studied within a clinical discipline however, and they have been identified as symptoms for many disorders, including PTSD.\n\nDue to the elusive nature of involuntary recurrent memories, very little is known about the subjective experience of flashbacks. However, theorists agree that this phenomenon is in part due to the manner in which memories of specific events are initially encoded (or entered) into memory, the way in which the memory is organized, and also the way in which the individual later recalls the event. Overall, theories that attempt to explain the flashback phenomenon can be categorized into one of two viewpoints. The \"special mechanism\" view is clinically oriented in that it holds that involuntary memories are due to traumatic events, and the memories for these events can be attributed to a special memory mechanism. On the other hand, the \"basic mechanism\" view is more experimentally oriented in that it is based on memory research. This view holds that traumatic memories are bound by the same parameters as all other every-day memories. Both viewpoints agree that involuntary recurrent memories result from rare events that would not normally occur.\n\nThese rare events elicit strong emotional reactions from the individual, since they violate normal expectations. According to the special mechanism view, the event would lead to fragmented voluntary encoding into memory (meaning that only certain isolated parts of the event would be encoded), thus making the conscious subsequent retrieval of the memory much more difficult. On the other hand, involuntary recurrent memories are likely to become more available, and these are more likely to be triggered by external cues. In contrast to this, the basic mechanism view holds that the traumatic event would lead to enhanced and cohesive encoding of the event in memory, and this would make both voluntary and involuntary memories more available for subsequent recall.\n\nWhat is currently an issue of controversy is the nature of the defining criteria that make up an involuntary memory. Up until recently, researchers believed that involuntary memories were a result of traumatic incidents that the individual experienced at a specific time and place, but the temporal and spatial features of the event are lost during an involuntary recollection episode. In other words, people who suffer from flashbacks lose all sense of time and place, and they feel as if they are re-experiencing the event instead of just recalling a memory. This is consistent with the special mechanism viewpoint in that the involuntary memory is based on a different memory mechanism than its voluntary counterpart. Furthermore, the initial emotions experienced at the time of encoding are also re-experienced during a flashback episode, and this can be especially distressing when the memory is of a traumatic event. It has also been demonstrated that the nature of the flashbacks experienced by an individual are static in that they retain an identical form upon each intrusion. This occurs even when the individual has learned new information that directly contradicts the information retained in the intrusive memory.\n\nUpon further investigation, it was found that involuntary memories are usually derived from either stimuli that indicated the onset of a traumatic event, or from stimuli that hold intense emotional significance to the individual simply because they were closely associated with the trauma in terms of timing. These stimuli then become warning signals that, if encountered again, serve to trigger a flashback. This has been termed the warning signal hypothesis. For example, a man experiences a flashback upon seeing sun spots on his lawn. This happens because he associates the spots with the headlights of the vehicle that he collided with, causing a horrific car accident. According to Ehlers and Clark, traumatic memories are more apt to induce flashbacks simply because of faulty encoding in that the individual fails to take contextual information into account, as well as time and place information that would usually be associated with everyday memories. These individuals become sensitized to stimuli that they associate with the traumatic event, which then serve as triggers for a flashback (even though the context surrounding the stimulus may be unrelated, such as sun spots being unrelated to headlights). These triggers may have elicited an adaptive response during the time of the traumatic experience, but they soon become maladaptive if the person continues to respond in the same way in situations in which no danger may be present.\n\nThe special mechanism viewpoint further adds to this by suggesting that these triggers activate the fragmented memory of the traumatic event, but protective cognitive mechanisms function to inhibit the recall of the original memory. Dual representation theory enhances this idea by suggesting two separate mechanisms that account for voluntary and involuntary memories; the first of which is called the verbally accessible memory system and the latter of which is referred to the situationally accessible memory system.\n\nIn contrast to this, theories belonging to the basic mechanism viewpoint hold that there are no separate mechanisms that account for voluntary and involuntary memories. The recall of memories for stressful events do not differ under involuntary and voluntary recall. Instead, it is the retrieval mechanism that is different for each type of recall. In involuntary recall, the external trigger creates an uncontrolled spreading of activation in memory, whereas in voluntary recall, this activation is strictly controlled and is goal-oriented.\n\nSeveral brain regions have been implicated in the neurological basis of flashbacks. The medial temporal lobes, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate gyrus and the prefrontal cortex are the most typically referenced with regards to involuntary memories.\n\nThe medial temporal lobes are commonly associated with memory. More specifically, the lobes have been linked to episodic/declarative memory and thus damage to these areas of the brain result in disruptions to declarative memory system. The hippocampus, located within the medial temporal regions, has also been highly related to memory processes. There are numerous functions in the hippocampus; these functions also include aspects of memory consolidation. Brain imaging studies have shown flashbacks activate areas associated with memory retrieval. The precuneus, located in the superior parietal lobe and the posterior cingulate gyrus have also been implicated in memory retrieval. In addition, studies have shown activity in areas of the prefrontal cortex to be involved in memory retrieval.\n\nThus, the medial temporal lobe, precuneus, superior parietal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus have all been implicated in flashbacks in accordance to their roles on memory retrieval.\n\nMemory has typically been divided into sensory, short term, and long term processes. According to Rasmuseen & Berntsen, 2009, \"long-term memory processes may form the core of spontaneous thought\". Thus, the memory process most related to flashbacks is long term memory. Additionally, other 2009 studies by Rasmuseen & Berntsen have shown that long term memory is also susceptible to extraneous factors such as recency effect, arousal and rehearsal as it pertains to accessibility. Compared to voluntary memories, involuntary memories show shorter retrieval times and little cognitive effort. Finally, involuntary memories arise due to automatic processing, which does not rely on higher-order cognitive monitoring, or executive control processing. Voluntary memory is normally associated with contextual information, which is what allows for correspondence between time and place, this is not true of flashbacks. According to Brewin, Lanius et, al, 2009, flashbacks, are disconnected from contextual information, and as a result are disconnected from time and place.\n\nTo date, the specific causes of flashbacks have not yet been confirmed. Several studies have proposed various potential factors. Gunasekaran et al., 2009, indicate there may be a link between food deprivation and stress on the occurrence of flashbacks. Psychiatrists suggest temporal lobe seizures may also have some relation.\n\nOn the reverse side, several ideas have been discounted in terms of their causing flashbacks. Tym et al., 2009, suggest this list includes medication or other substances, Charles Bonnet syndrome, delayed palinopsia, hallucinations, dissociative phenomena, and depersonalization syndrome.\n\nA study of the persistence of traumatic memories in World War II prisoners of war investigates via the administration of surveys the extent and severity of flashbacks that occur in prisoners of war. This study concluded that the persistence of severely traumatic autobiographical memories can last upwards of 65 years. Until recently, the study of flashbacks has been limited to participants who already experience flashbacks, such as those suffering from PTSD, restricting researchers to observational/exploratory rather than experimental studies.\n\nNeuroimaging techniques have been applied to the investigation of flashbacks. Using these techniques, researchers attempt to discover the structural and functional differences in the anatomy of the brain in individuals who suffer from flashbacks compared to those who do not. Neuroimaging involves a cluster of techniques, including computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (including functional), as well as magnetoencephalography. Neuroimaging studies investigating flashbacks are based on current psychological theories that are used as the foundation for the research, and one such theory that is consistently investigated is the difference between explicit and implicit memory. This distinction dictates the manner in which memories are later recalled, namely either consciously (voluntarily) or unconsciously (involuntarily).\n\nThese methods have largely relied on subtractive reasoning, in which the participant voluntarily recalls a memory and then the memory is again recalled, but this time through involuntary means. Involuntary memories (or flashbacks) are elicited in the participant by reading an emotionally charged script to them that is designed to trigger a flashback in individuals who suffer from PTSD. The investigators record the regions of the brain that are active during each of these conditions, and then subtract the activity. Whatever is left is assumed to underpin the neurological differences between the conditions.\n\nImaging studies looking at patients with PTSD as they undergo flashback experiences have identified elevated activation in regions of the dorsal stream including the mid-occipital lobe, primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. The dorsal stream is involved in sensory processing, and therefore these activations might underlie the vivid visual experiences associated with flashbacks. The study also found reduced activation in regions such as the inferior temporal cortex and parahippocampus which are involved in processing allocentric relations. These deactivations might contribute to feelings of dissociation from reality during flashback experiences.\n\nFlashbacks are often associated with mental illness as they are a symptom and a feature in diagnostic criteria for PTSD, acute stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Flashbacks have also been observed in people suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, homesickness, near-death experiences, epileptic seizures, and substance abuse.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the use of some drugs can cause a person to experience flashbacks; users of LSD sometimes report \"acid flashbacks\", while other studies show that the use of other drugs, specifically cannabis, can help reduce the occurrence of flashbacks in people with PTSD.\n\nThe psychological phenomenon has frequently been portrayed in film and television. Some of the most accurate media portrayals of flashbacks have been those related to wartime, and the association of flashbacks to PTSD caused by the traumas and stresses of war. One of the earliest screen portrayals of this is in the 1945 film \"Mildred Pierce\".\n\n"}

He along with his successor Jack Grogan, are predecessors and foils of James Gordon.\n\nLoeb is introduced in \"\" as the commissioner of Gotham City's Police Department at about the time Batman begins his war on crime. He is in mob boss Carmine Falcone's pocket and immediately considers then-Lieutenant James Gordon's honesty a threat. However, he does not immediately share the same opinion about Batman, since the masked vigilante is targeting only low-level criminals, and is popular with the public. One night, however, Batman attacks Falcone's mansion during a dinner party, the guests at which include Loeb and several other Gotham elites, and publicly announces that he intends to bring them down as well.\n\nEnraged, Loeb orders Gordon to arrest Batman immediately. However, the vigilante proves frustratingly elusive, until one night in which the police corner him in an abandoned building following an impromptu rescue on the street. Loeb orders a bomb dropped on the building and a SWAT unit conducting an armed search of the rubble. As morning breaks however, Batman escapes, much to Loeb's annoyance.\n\nWhen Gordon (alongside assistant district attorney Harvey Dent) begins surreptitiously helping Batman, Loeb blackmails him with evidence of his extramarital affair with Sgt. Sarah Essen. However, Gordon confesses his indiscretion to his wife Barbara.\n\nEventually, Batman, Gordon, and Dent expose Loeb's ties to the Falcone mob and he is forced to resign. According to Gordon, Loeb's replacement, Jack Grogan, is just as corrupt. Gordon becomes the department's commissioner a few years later.\n\nIn \"\", Loeb returns, hoping to use the Hangman killings as an excuse to try to get the city council to remove Gordon from his position as commissioner. His overall goal is to regain his former position and he justifies taking over due to his \"experience\". However, before his plans can be fulfilled, he becomes a victim of the Hangman Killer himself.\n\nA younger Loeb appears as a captain in flashbacks in \"Wrath Child\" (\"Batman Confidential\" #13-16), where he arranges Gordon's transfer to Chicago for 15 years after Gordon shot a corrupt cop and his wife in self-defense. Loeb fears the news could bring him and other corrupt cops down and threatens Gordon with the death of the cop's son to force him to accept the transfer.\n\nLoeb is referred to in DC Comics' \"Hitman\" series. Moe Dubelz, one of Gotham City's most powerful mob bosses, says that Loeb helped his criminal empire to flourish by keeping the police at bay, in return for generous payments. Dubelz remembers Loeb's term as commissioner as the \"good times\" for his organization.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Loeb is once again the commissioner during Batman's early career, and is still corrupt. In \"Detective Comics\" #25, Loeb sets up Gordon with a corrupt partner, Henshaw, who means to give Gordon to Black Mask's henchmen. Batman saves Gordon. Many of the corrupt police officers under Loeb's command who were associated with the Black Mask gang perish, leading Batman and Gordon to theorize that Loeb has suffered some manner of emotional collapse. Later during the \"Zero Year\" storyline, the Riddler attacks GCPD blimps, while taking over the city's power grid and allowing the city to be flooded by a hurricane, causing many to crash. Loeb is on one of them. After the crisis is resolved and the Riddler is captured thanks to the efforts of Batman, Gordon, and Lucius Fox, Loeb resigns leaving Gordon to become the department's commissioner by a month later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film made its world premiere at the 29th Annecy International Animated Film Festival in Annecy, France, and won the Platinum Grand Prize at the Future Film Festival in Bologna, Italy. It was shown with the theatrical release of \"Cars\".\nThe short was written and directed by Andrew Jimenez and Mark Andrews and produced by Osnat Shurer, head of Pixar's Shorts group. The score for the short was written by Michael Giacchino. Like many Pixar shorts, the film is completely free of dialogue and vocal effects, instead using music (played by the characters) and pantomime to tell the story. Unlike most Pixar shorts, which are solely driven by storyboarding and scriptwriting, the music in \"One Man Band\" was developed directly alongside the film's story; Giacchino collaborated extensively with the film's directors due to the large role of music in the short.\n\nOn January 31, 2006 it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but lost to \"\" by John Canemaker and Peggy Stern. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2005.\n\nBass, a skilled and proud street performer, plays a routine tune on his wind and percussion instruments in a deserted Italian village square in the afternoon, waiting for a pedestrian to tip him in his rusty iron cup. Soon, he spots Tippy, a humble peasant girl clutching a big gold coin, and aiming to drop it in the large plaza fountain to make a wish. Bass, seizing the opportunity, immediately plays an impromptu piece, capturing the young girl's attention. \n\nJust when Tippy is about to drop the coin into Bass's cup, a newcomer steps onto the scene. Treble, a suave and flamboyant street performer, plays a more attractive tune on his string instruments, effectively stealing Tippy's attention, much to Bass's anger. Not to be outdone, Bass ups his ante, with Treble daring to take it even further. As the two rivals unleash their arsenal of musical weapons, trying to vie for the attention (or rather, the tip) of Tippy, the girl cowers in their wild musical cacophony, and in the process, accidentally drops her coin, which falls down a drain and gets lost in the sewers of the village.\n\nHeartbroken, Tippy sniffles, but then angrily demands from Treble and Bass a replacement coin for the one they made her lose (just by physically sticking her hand out). When both musicians come up empty-handed, Tippy is left with no choice but to take one of Treble's violins and Bass's iron cup in an attempt to get her money back by playing solo. She then tunes the violin and begins to play it like a true virtuoso, prompting a passing pedestrian to drop a large bag of gold coins onto her cup. \n\nElated, Tippy hugs the bag and approaches the fountain, but not before she pulls two coins out of her bag and tempts Treble and Bass. But as they eagerly reach out to grab the coins, she tosses them into the top of the fountain, out of reach, much to their dismay. A post-credits scene shows that it is now nighttime, with Treble standing on Bass, trying to reach for the coins. As the two start to fall backwards, the film ends.\n\nBeginning development shortly after the completion of the superhero movie \"The Incredibles\", \"One Man Band\" was directed by Andrew Jiminez and Mark Andrews, who had previously worked together on films such as \"The Iron Giant\" and \"Spider-Man\". In late 2004, they were approached by Ed Catmull and asked to visit his office; according to the duo, they were initially concerned about the implications of this, but were later relieved after Catmull requested that they begin working on a brand new short film for Pixar. Jiminez and Andrews decided to create a film centered around music, a subject which they were both decidedly passionate about, and began developing a story about two musicians quarreling over the donation of a young peasant girl. The short was pitched to Pixar CEO John Lasseter and \"The Incredibles\" director Brad Bird, who quickly accepted the film for production.\n\nThe violinists featured in the score for the film are:\n\nThe score was recorded at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood, CA.

In most circumstances, making testable predictions with QCD is extremely difficult, due to the infinite number of possible topologically-inequivalent interactions. Over short distances, the coupling is small enough that this infinite number of terms can be approximated accurately by a finite number of terms. Although limited in scope, this approach has resulted in the most precise tests of QCD to date .\n\nAn important test of perturbative QCD is the measurement of the ratio of production rates for formula_2 and formula_3. Since only the total production rate is considered, the summation over all final-state hadrons cancels the dependence on specific hadron type, and this ratio can be calculated in perturbative QCD. \n\nMost strong-interaction processes can not be calculated directly with perturbative QCD, since one cannot observe free quarks and gluons due to color confinement. For example, the structure hadrons has a non-perturbative nature. To account for this, physicists developed the QCD factorization theorem, which separates the cross section into two parts: the process dependent perturbatively-calculable short-distance parton cross section, and the universal long-distance functions. These universal long-distance functions can be measured with global fit to experiments and include parton distribution functions, fragmentation functions, multi-parton correlation functions, generalized parton distributions, generalized distribution amplitudes and many kinds of form factors. There are several collaborations for each kind of universal long-distance functions. They have become an important part of modern particle physics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2060857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060857", "title": "IBM SSEC", "text": "IBM SSEC\n\nThe IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) was an electromechanical computer built by IBM. Its design was started in late 1944, and it operated from January 1948 to August 1952. It had many of the features of a stored-program computer and was the first operational machine able to treat its instructions as data, but it was not fully electronic.\nAlthough the SSEC proved useful for several high-profile applications it soon became obsolete. As the last large electromechanical computer ever built, its greatest success was the publicity it provided for IBM.\n\nDuring World War II, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) funded and built an Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC) for Howard H. Aiken at Harvard University. The machine, formally dedicated in August 1944, was widely known as the Harvard Mark I. The President of IBM, Thomas J. Watson Sr., did not like Aiken's press release that gave no credit to IBM for its funding and engineering effort. Watson and Aiken decided to go their separate ways, and IBM began work on a project to build their own larger and more visible machine.\n\nAstronomer Wallace John Eckert of Columbia University provided specifications for the new machine; the project budget of almost $1 million was an immense amount for the time.\nFrancis \"Frank\" E. Hamilton (1898–1972) supervised both construction of the ASCC as well as its successor. Robert Rex Seeber Jr. was also hired away from the Harvard group, and became known as the chief architect of the new machine.\nModules were manufactured in IBM's facility at Endicott, New York, under Director of Engineering John McPherson after the basic design was ready in December 1945.\n\nThe February 1946 announcement of the fully electronic ENIAC energized the project.\nThe new machine, called the IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC), was ready to be installed by August 1947.\nWatson called such machines \"calculators\" because \"computer\" then referred to humans employed to perform calculations and he \"wanted to convey the message that IBM's machines were not designed to replace people. Rather they were designed to help people, by relieving them of drudgery.\".\n\nThe SSEC was installed on three sides of a room on the ground floor of a building near IBM's headquarters at 590 Madison Avenue in New York City, behind a large window where it was visible to people passing by on the busy street. The space had formerly been occupied by a women's shoe store. The noisy SSEC was sometimes called \"Poppa\" by the viewing pedestrians.\nIt was dedicated and first demonstrated to the public on January 27, 1948. A. Wayne Brooke served as the chief electronic engineer for the machine's operation starting in 1950.\nHerb Grosch, the second person with a Ph.D. hired by IBM, was one of its first programmers. Another early programmer was Edgar \"Ted\" Codd. Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Stewart was chief operator, and often appeared in publicity photos.\n\nThe SSEC was an unusual hybrid of vacuum tubes and electromechanical relays. Approximately 12,500 vacuum tubes were used in the arithmetic unit, control, and its eight (relatively high-speed) registers, which had an access time of less than one millisecond. About 21,400 relays were used for control and 150 lower-speed registers, with an access time of 20 milliseconds. The relay technology was similar to the ASCC, based on technology invented by Clair D. Lake (1888–1958). The arithmetic logic unit of the SSEC was a modified IBM 603 electronic multiplier, which had been designed by James W. Bryce. The bulky tubes were military surplus radar technology, which filled one entire wall. The memory was organized as signed 19-digit decimal numbers. Multiplication was computed with 14 digits in each factor. Most of the quoted 400,000 digit capacity was in the form of reels of punched paper tape.\nAddition took 285 microseconds and multiplication 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations much faster than the Harvard Mark I. Data that had to be retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another wall. A chain hoist was needed to lift the heavy reels of paper into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper tape readers connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted of another 36 paper tape readers. A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or high-speed printers. The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets. The familiar 80 columns of IBM punched card technology were recorded sideways as one column of the tape.\n\nUsing well-tested technology, the SSEC's calculations were accurate and precise for its time, but one early programmer, John Backus, said \"you had to be there the entire time the program was running, because it would stop every three minutes, and only the people who had programmed it could see how to get it running again”. ENIAC co-designer J. Presper Eckert (no relation to the IBM Eckert) called it \"some big monstrosity over there that I don't think ever worked right\".\n\nSeeber had carefully designed the SSEC to treat instructions as data, so they could be modified and stored under program control. IBM filed a patent based on the SSEC on January 19, 1949, which was later upheld as supporting the machine's stored program ability.\nEach instruction could take input from any source (electronic or mechanical registers or tape readers) store the result in any destination (electronic or mechanical registers, tape or card punch or printer), and gave the address of the next instruction, which could also be any source. This made it powerful in theory.\nHowever, in practice instructions were stored usually on paper tape, resulting in an overall rate of only about 50 instructions per second. \nThe serial nature of the paper tape memory made programming the SSEC more like the World War II era calculators. For example, \"loops\" were usually literal loops of paper tape glued together. For each new program, tapes and card decks were literally \"loaded\" on the readers, and a plugboard changed in the printer to modify output formatting.\nFor these reasons, the SSEC is usually classified as the last of the \"programmable calculator\" machines instead of the first stored-program computer.\n\nThe first application of the SSEC was calculating the positions of the Moon and planets, known as Ephemeris.\nEach position of the Moon required about 11,000 additions, 9,000 multiplications, and 2,000 table look-ups, which took the SSEC about seven minutes.\nThis application used the machine for about six months; by then other users were lined up to keep the machine busy.\n\nIt has sometimes been said that the SSEC produced the Moon-position tables that were later used for plotting the course of the 1969 Apollo flight to the Moon. Records closer to 1969 suggest, however, that while there was a relationship, it was most likely less immediate. Thus, Mulholland and Devine (1968), working at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, reported \nthat the JPL Ephemeris Tape System was \"used for virtually all computations of spacecraft trajectories in the US space program\", and that it had, as its current lunar ephemeris, an evaluation of the Improved Lunar Ephemeris incorporating a number of corrections: sources are named as 'The Improved Lunar Ephemeris' (documentation which was the report of the Eckert computations carried out by the SSEC, complete with lunar position results from 1952–1971), with corrections as described by Eckert et al. (1966), and in the Supplement to the AE 1968. Taken together, the corrections thus referenced modify practically every individual element of the lunar computations, and thus the space program appears to have been using lunar data generated by a modified and corrected derivative of the computational procedure pioneered using the SSEC, rather than the directly resulting tables themselves.\n\nThe first paying customer was General Electric. The SSEC was also used for calculations by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for the NEPA project to power an airplane with a nuclear reactor. Robert D. Richtmyer of Los Alamos National Laboratory used the SSEC for some of the first large-scale applications of the Monte Carlo method.\nLlewellyn Thomas solved problems with stability of laminar flow, programmed by Donald A. Quarles Jr. and Phyllis K. Brown.\nIn 1949, Cuthbert Hurd was hired (also after a visit to the SSEC) and started a department of applied science; the operation of SSEC was eventually put into that organization.\n\nThe SSEC room was one of the first to use a raised floor, so visitors would not see unsightly cables or trip over them.\nThe large array of flashing lights and noisy electro-mechanical relays made IBM very visible to the public. The SSEC appeared in the film \"Walk East on Beacon\" based on a book by J. Edgar Hoover.\nIt was widely covered positively by the press.\nThe SSEC attracted both customers and new employees. Both Hurd and Backus were hired after seeing demonstrations of the facility.\n\nThe 1946 ENIAC had more tubes than the SSEC and was faster in some operations, but was originally less flexible, needing to be rewired for each new problem. At the end of 1948 a new IBM 604 multiplier was announced, which used newer tube technology that already made the bulky tubes of the SSEC obsolete. By May 1949 the Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator was announced, and shipped in September. It was effectively a much scaled-down version of the SSEC technology to allow customers to perform similar calculations. Even by the end of 1948, the limited electronic memory of the SSEC was seen as a problem, and IBM soon licensed the Williams tube technology developed on the Manchester Baby at the Victoria University of Manchester. Subsequent computers would have electronic random access memory, and in fact the ability to execute instructions from processor registers was generally not adopted. The 77-bit wide programming word was also abandoned for fewer bits but much faster operation.\n\nBy 1951 the Ferranti Mark I was marketed in the UK as a commercial computer using Williams tube technology, followed by the UNIVAC I using delay line memory in the US. These memory technologies allowed stored-program features to be more practical. The stored-program concept had been first widely published in 1945 in the \"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC\" and became known as the Von Neumann architecture. The EDVAC (first working in 1949) was the ENIAC successor, designed by the team who then marketed the UNIVAC.\n\nThe SSEC ran until August 1952, when it was dismantled, having been made obsolete by fully electronic computers.\nAn IBM 701 computer, known as the Defense Calculator, was installed in the same room for its April 7, 1953, public debut.\nIn July 1953 the much less expensive (and even better selling) IBM 650 was announced, which had been developed by the same Endicott team who developed the SSEC.\n\n\n\n"}

The surrender occurred after 18 days of fierce fighting against the overwhelming Japanese forces that had invaded the territory. The occupation lasted for three years and eight months until Japan surrendered at the end of Second World War. The length of this period () later became a metonym of the occupation.\n\nDuring the Imperial Japanese military's full-scale invasion of China in 1937, Hong Kong as part of the British empire was not under attack. Nevertheless, its situation was influenced by the war in China due to proximity to the mainland China. In early March 1939, during an Imperial Japanese bombing raid on Shenzhen, a few bombs fell accidentally on Hong Kong territory, destroying a bridge and a train station.\n\nIn 1936, Germany and the Empire of Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. In 1937 Fascist Italy joined the pact, forming the core to what would become known as the Axis Powers.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, Nazi Germany was near the height of its military power. After the invasion of Poland and fall of France, German forces had overrun much of Western Europe and were racing towards Moscow. The United States was neutral and opposition to Nazi Germany was given only by Britain, the British Commonwealth and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe United States provided minor support to China in its fight against Imperial Japan's invasion. It imposed an embargo on the sale of oil to Japan after less aggressive forms of economic sanctions failed to halt Japanese advances. On 7 December 1941 (Honolulu time), Japan entered World War II with the Japanese occupation of Malaya, as well as other attacks including attacking the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor and American-ruled Philippines, and the Japanese invasion of Thailand.\n\nAs part of a general Pacific campaign, the Imperial Japanese launched an assault on Hong Kong on the morning of 8 December 1941. British, Canadian, and Indian forces, supported by the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Forces attempted to resist the rapidly advancing Imperial Japanese but were heavily outnumbered. After racing down the New Territories and Kowloon, Imperial Japanese forces crossed Victoria Harbour on 18 December. After fierce fighting continued on Hong Kong Island, the only reservoir was lost. Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers fought at the crucial Wong Nai Chung Gap that secured the passage between Victoria, Hong Kong and secluded southern sections of the island. Finally defeated, on 25 December 1941, British colonial officials headed by the Governor of Hong Kong Mark Aitchison Young surrendered at the Japanese headquarters. To the local people, the day was known as \"Black Christmas\".\n\nThe capitulation of Hong Kong was signed on the 26th at The Peninsula Hotel. On 20 February 1942 General Rensuke Isogai became the first Imperial Japanese governor of Hong Kong. Just before the British surrendered, drunken Imperial Japanese soldiers entered St. Stephen's College, which was being used as a hospital. The Imperial Japanese then confronted two volunteer doctors and shot both of them when entry was refused. They then burst into the wards and attacked all of the wounded soldiers and medical staff who were incapable of hiding in what was known as the St. Stephen's College incident. This ushered in almost four years of Imperial Japanese administration.\n\nThroughout the Imperial Japanese occupation, Hong Kong was ruled under martial law as an occupied territory. Led by General Rensuke Isogai, the Japanese established their administrative centre and military headquarters at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon. The military government; comprising administrative, civilian affairs, economic, judicial, and naval departments; enacted stringent regulations and, through executive bureaus, exercised power over all residents of Hong Kong. They also set up the puppet Chinese Representative Council and Chinese Cooperative Council consisting of local leading Chinese and Eurasian community leaders.\n\nIn addition to Governor Mark Young, 7,000 British soldiers and civilians were kept in prisoner-of-war or internment camps, such as Sham Shui Po Prisoner Camp and Stanley Internment Camp. Famine, malnourishment and sickness were pervasive. Severe cases of malnutrition among inmates occurred in the Stanley Internment Camp in 1945. Moreover, the Imperial Japanese military government blockaded Victoria Harbour and controlled warehouses.\n\nEarly in January 1942, former members of the Hong Kong Police including Indians and Chinese were recruited into a reformed police called the \"Kempeitai\" with new uniforms. The police routinely performed executions at King's Park in Kowloon by using Chinese for beheading, shooting and bayonet practice. The Imperial Japanese gendarmerie took over all police stations and organised the Police in five divisions, namely East Hong Kong, West Hong Kong, Kowloon, New Territories and Water Police. This force was headed by Colonel Noma Kennosuke. The headquarters was situated in the former Supreme Court Building. Police in Hong Kong were under the organisation and control of the Imperial Japanese government. Imperial Japanese experts and administrators were chiefly employed in the Governor's Office and its various bureaus. Two councils of Chinese and Eurasian leaders were set up to manage the Chinese population.\n\nAll trade and economic activities were strictly regulated by Japanese authorities, who took control of the majority of the factories. Having deprived vendors and banks of their possessions, the occupying forces outlawed the Hong Kong Dollar and replaced it with the Japanese Military Yen. The exchange rate was fixed at 2 Hong Kong dollars to one military yen in January 1942. Later, the yen was re-valued at 4 Hong Kong dollars to a yen in July 1942, which meant local people could exchange fewer military notes than before. While the residents of Hong Kong were impoverished by the inequitable and forcibly imposed exchange rate, the Imperial Japanese government sold the Hong Kong Dollar to help finance their war-time economy. In June 1943, the military yen was made the sole legal tender. Prices of commodities for sale had to be marked in yen. Hyper-inflation then disrupted the economy, inflicting hardship upon the residents of the colony. Enormous devaluation of the Imperial Japanese Military Yen after the war made it almost worthless.\n\nPublic transportation and utilities unavoidably failed, owing to the shortage of fuel and the aerial bombardment of Hong Kong by the Americans. Tens of thousands of people became homeless and helpless, and many of them were employed in shipbuilding and construction. In the agricultural field, the Imperial Japanese took over the race track at Fanling and the air strip at Kam Tin for their rice-growing experiments.\n\nWith the intention of boosting the Imperial Japanese influence on Hong Kong, two Imperial Japanese banks, the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Taiwan, were re-opened. These two banks replaced the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and two other British banks responsible for issuing the banknotes. They then liquidated various Allied banks. British, American and Dutch bankers were forced to live in a small hotel, while some bankers who were viewed as enemies of the Imperial Japanese were executed. In May 1942, Imperial Japanese companies were encouraged to be set up. A Hong Kong trade syndicate consisting of Imperial Japanese firms was set up in October 1942 to manipulate overseas trade.\n\nIn order to cope with a lack of resources and the potential for Chinese residents of Hong Kong to support the allied forces in a possible invasion to retake the colony, the Japanese introduced a policy of forced deportation. As a result, the unemployed were deported to the Chinese mainland, and the population of Hong Kong dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945.\n\nFurthermore, the Japanese modified the territory’s infrastructure and landscape significantly in order to serve their wartime interests. In order to expand the Kai Tak Airport, for example, the Japanese demolished the Sung Wong Toi Monument in today's Kowloon City. Buildings of prestigious secondary schools such as Wah Yan College Hong Kong, which is one of the two Jesuit schools in Hong Kong, Diocesan Boys' School, the Central British School, the St. Paul's Girls' College of the Anglican church and de La Salle brothers' La Salle College were commandeered by occupying forces as military hospitals. It was rumoured that Diocesan Boys' School was used by the Japanese as an execution site.\n\nLife was hard for people under Japanese rule. As there was inadequate food supply, the Japanese rationed necessities such as rice, oil, flour, salt and sugar. Each family was given a rationing licence, and every person could only buy 6.4 taels (), of rice per day. Most people did not have enough food to eat, and many died of starvation. The rationing system was abolished in 1944.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the Japanese committed atrocities against many local Chinese including the rape of many Chinese women. During the three years and eight months of occupation, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.\n\nDuring the occupation, hospitals available to the masses were limited. The Kowloon Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital were occupied by the Japanese army. Despite the lack of medicine and funds, the Tung Wah and Kwong Wah Hospital continued their social services but to a limited scale. These included provision of food, medicine, clothing, and burial services. Although funds were provided, they still had great financial difficulties. Failure to collect rents and the high reparation costs forced them to promote fundraising activities like musical performances and dramas.\n\nTung Wah hospital and the charitable organisation Po Leung Kuk continued to provide charity relief, while substantial donations were given by members of the Chinese elite. Po Leung Kuk also took in orphans, but were faced with financial problems during the occupation, as their bank deposits could not be withdrawn under Japanese control. Their services could only be continued through donations by Aw Boon Haw, a long-term financier of Po Leung Kuk.\n\nThere were very few public hospitals during the Japanese occupation as many of them were forcibly converted to military hospitals. Despite the inadequate supply of resources, Tung Wah Hospital and Kwong Wah Hospital still continuously offered limited social services to needy people. In June 1943 the management of water, gas and electricity was transferred into private Japanese hands.\n\nThrough schooling, mass media and other means of propaganda, the Japanese tried to foster favourable view amongst residents of the occupation. This process of Japanisation prevailed in many aspects of daily life.\n\nIt was the Japanese conviction that education was key to securing their influence over the populace. The Japanese language became a mandatory subject in schools, and students who performed poorly in Japanese exams risked corporal punishment. According to a testimonial, English was forbidden from being taught and was not tolerated outside the classroom. Some private Japanese language schools were established to promote oral Japanese. The Military Administration ran the Teachers' Training Course, and those teachers who failed a Japanese bench-mark test would need to take a three-month training course. The Japanese authorities tried to introduce Japanese traditions and customs to Hong Kong students through the Japanese lessons at school. Famous historical stories such as Mōri Motonari's \"\"Sanbon no ya\" (Three Arrows)\" and Xufu’s () voyage to Japan were introduced in Japanese language textbooks. The primary aim of the Japanisation of the education system was to facilitate Japanese control over the territory’s populace in furtherence of the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\n\nBy 1943, in stark contrast to the successful imposition of the Japanese language upon the local populace, only one formal language school, the Bougok School (寳覺學校), was providing Cantonese language courses to Japanese people in Hong Kong. According to an instructor at the Bougok School, \"teaching Cantonese is difficult because there is no system and set pattern in Cantonese grammar; and you have to change the pronunciation as the occasion demands\" and \"it would be easier for Cantonese people to learn Japanese than Japanese people to learn Cantonese\".\n\nThe Japanese promoted the use of Japanese as the lingua franca between the locals and the occupying forces. English shop signs and advertisements were banned and, in April 1942, streets and buildings in Central were renamed in Japanese. For example, Queen's Road became Meiji-dori and Des Voeux Road became Shōwa-dori. Similarly, the Gloucester Hotel became the Matsubara. The Peninsula Hotel, the Matsumoto; Lane Crawford, Matsuzakaya. The Queen's Theatre was renamed first the Nakajima-dori, then the Meiji. Their propaganda also pointed to the pre-eminence of the Japanese way of life, of Japanese spiritual values and the ills of western materialism.\n\nGovernment House, the residence of English governors prior to occupation, was the seat of power for the Japanese military governors. During the occupation, the buildings were largely reconstructed in 1944 following designs by Japanese engineer Siechi Fujimura, including the addition of a Japanese-style tower which remains to this day. Many Georgian architectural features were removed during this period. The roofs also continue to reflect a Japanese influence.\n\nThe commemoration of Japanese festivals, state occasions, victories and anniversaries also strengthened the Japanese influence over Hong Kong. For instance, there was Yasukuri or Shrine Festival honouring the dead. There was also a Japanese Empire Day on 11 February 1943 centred around the worship of the Emperor Jimmu.\n\nThe \"Hong Kong News\", a pre-war Japanese-owned English newspaper, was revived in January 1942 during the Japanese occupation. The editor, E.G. Ogura, was Japanese and the staff members were mainly Chinese and Portuguese who previously worked for the \"South China Morning Post\". It became the mouthpiece of the Japanese propaganda. Ten local Chinese newspapers had been reduced to five in May. These newspapers were under press censorship. Radio sets were used for Japanese propaganda. Amusements still existed, though only for those who could afford them. The cinemas only screened Japanese films, such as \"The Battle of Hong Kong\", the only film made in Hong Kong during the Japanese occupation. Directed by Shigeo Tanaka ( \"Tanaka Shigeo\") and produced by the Dai Nippon Film Company, the film featured an all-Japanese cast but a few Hong Kong film personalities were also involved. This film appeared on the first anniversary of the attack.\n\nIn December 1941, a group of Japanese soldiers killed ten Red Cross stretcher bearers at Wong Nai Chung Gap despite the fact that the stretcher bearers all wore the red cross armband. These soldiers captured a further five medics who were tied to a tree, two of whom were taken away by the soldiers, never to be seen again. The remaining three attempted to escape during the night, but only one survived the escape. A team of amateur archaeologists found the remains of half of a badge. Evidence pointed to its belonging to Barclay, the captain of the Royal Army Medical Corps, therefore the archaeologists presented it to Barclay's son, Jim, who had never met his father before his death.\n\nOther notable massacres also include the St. Stephen's College massacre, and a mass murder at Mui Wo called the Silver Mine Bay massacre (銀礦灣大屠殺) by some locals. After the Japanese surrender, fifteen Japanese soldiers killed seventy people at Mui Wo. They burned three villages and captured three hundred villagers, many of whom were found dead.\n\nOriginally formed by Zeng Sheng (曾生) in Guangdong in 1939, this group mainly comprised peasants, students, and seamen, including Yuan Geng. When the war reached Hong Kong in 1941, the guerrilla force grew from 200 to more than 6,000 soldiers. In January 1942, the Guangdong people's anti-Japanese East River guerrillas (廣東人民抗日游擊隊東江縱隊) was established to reinforce anti-Japanese forces in Dongjiang and Zhujiang Pearl River deltas. The guerillas' most significant contribution to the Allies, in particular, was their rescue of twenty American pilots who parachuted into Kowloon when their planes were shot down by the Japanese. In the wake of the British retreat, the guerillas picked up abandoned weapons and established bases in the New Territories and Kowloon. Applying the tactics of guerrilla warfare, they killed Chinese traitors and collaborators. They protected traders in Kowloon and Guangzhou, attacked the police station at Tai Po, and bombed Kai Tak Airport. During the Japanese occupation the only fortified resistance was mounted by the East River guerillas.\n\nIn January 1942 the HK-Kowloon brigade (港九大隊) was established from the Guangdong People's anti-Japanese guerilla force. In February 1942 with local residents Choi Kwok-Leung (蔡國梁) as commander and Chan Tat-Ming (陳達明) as political commissar, they were armed with 30 machine guns and several hundred rifles left by defeated British forces. They numbered about 400 between 1942 and 1945 and operated in Sai Kung. Additionally, the guerillas were noteworthy in rescuing prisoners-of-war, notably Sir Lindsay Ride, Sir Douglas Clague, Professor Gordan King, and David Bosanquet. In December 1943 the Guangdong force reformed, with the East River guerillas absorbing the HK-Kowloon brigade into the larger unit.\n\nThe British Army Aid Group was formed in 1942 at the suggestion of Colonel Lindsay Ride. The group rescued allied POWs including airmen shot down and workers trapped in occupied HK. It also developed a role in intelligence gathering. In the process, the Group provided protection to the Dongjiang River which was a source for domestic water in Hong Kong. This was the first organisation in which Britons, Chinese and other nationalities served with no racial divide. Francis Lee Yiu-pui and Paul Tsui Ka-cheung were commissioned as officers.\n\nUnited States Army Air Forces (USAAF) units based in China attacked the Hong Kong area from October 1942. Most of these raids involved a small number of aircraft, and typically targeted Japanese cargo ships which had been reported by Chinese guerrillas. By January 1945 the city was being regularly raided by the USAAF. The largest raid on Hong Kong took place on 16 January 1945 when, as part of the South China Sea raid, 471 United States Navy aircraft attacked shipping, harbour facilities and other targets.\n\nThe Japanese occupation of Hong Kong ended in 1945, after Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. Hong Kong was handed over by the Imperial Japanese Army to the Royal Navy on 30 August 1945; British control over Hong Kong was thus restored. 30 August was declared as \"Liberation Day\" (), and was a public holiday in Hong Kong until 1997.\n\nGeneral Takashi Sakai, who led the invasion of Hong Kong and subsequently served as governor-general during the Japanese occupation, was tried as a war criminal, convicted and executed on the afternoon of 30 September 1946.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Japanese surrender, it was unclear whether the United Kingdom or the Republic of China would assume sovereignty of the territory. The Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek assumed that China, including formerly European-occupied territories such as Hong Kong and Macau, would be re-unified under his rule. Several years earlier, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt insisted that colonialism would have to end, and promised Soong Mei-ling that Hong Kong would be restored to Chinese control. However the British moved quickly to regain control of Hong Kong. As soon as he heard word of the Japanese surrender, Franklin Gimson, Hong Kong's colonial secretary, left his prison camp and declared himself the territory's acting governor. A government office was set up at the Former French Mission Building in Victoria on 1 September 1945. On 30 August 1945, British Rear Admiral Sir Cecil Halliday Jepson Harcourt sailed into Hong Kong on board the cruiser to re-establish the British government's control over the colony. Harcourt personally selected Chinese-Canadian Lt(N) William Lore of the Royal Canadian Navy as the first Allied officer ashore, in recognition of the sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers in the defence of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 16 September 1945, Harcourt formally accepted the Japanese surrender from Maj.-Gen. Umekichi Okada and Vice Admiral Ruitaro Fujita at Government House.\n\nHong Kong's post-war recovery was astonishingly swift. By November 1945, the economy had recovered so well that government controls were lifted and free markets restored. The population returned to around one million by early 1946 due to immigration from China. Colonial taboos also broke down in the post-war years as European colonial powers realised that they could not administer their colonies as they did before the war. Chinese people were no longer forbidden from certain beaches, or from living on Victoria Peak.\n\n\n"}

Importantly, the later players must have some information of the first's choice, otherwise the difference in time would have no strategic effect. Sequential games hence are governed by the time axis, and represented in the form of decision trees.\n\nSequential games with perfect information can be analysed mathematically using combinatorial game theory.\n\nDecision trees are the extensive form of dynamic games that provide information on the possible ways that a given game can be played. They show the sequence in which players act and the number of times that they can each make a decision. Decision trees also provide information on what each player knows or does not know at the point in time they decide on an action to take. Payoffs of each player are also given at the decision nodes of the tree. Extensive form representations were introduced by Neumann and further developed by Kuhn in the earliest years of game theory between 1910–1930.\n\nRepeated games are an example of sequential games. Players play a stage game and the result of this game will determine how the game continues. At every new stage, both players will have complete information on how the previous stages had played out. A discount rate between the values of 0 and 1 is usually taken into account when considering the payoff of each player in these games. Repeated games can illustrate the psychological aspect of these games, including trust and revenge, as each player makes a decision at every stage game based on how the game has been played out so far.\n\nUnlike sequential games, simultaneous games do not have a time axis as players choose their moves without being sure of the other's, and are usually represented in the form of payoff matrices. Extensive form representations are usually used for sequential games, since they explicitly illustrate the sequential aspects of a game. Combinatorial games are usually sequential games.\n\nGames such as chess, infinite chess, backgammon, tic-tac-toe and Go are examples of sequential games. The size of the decision trees can vary according to game complexity, ranging from the small game tree of tic-tac-toe, to an immensely complex game tree of chess so large that even computers cannot map it completely.\n\nIn sequential games with perfect information, a subgame perfect equilibrium can be found by backward induction.\n\n"}
{"id": "2060872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060872", "title": "Anacamptis morio", "text": "Anacamptis morio\n\nAnacamptis morio, the green-winged orchid or green-veined orchid (synonym \"Orchis morio\"), is a flowering plant of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It usually has purple flowers, and is found in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIt flowers from late April to June in the British Isles, and as early as February in other countries, such as France. The inflorescence is of various colours, mainly purple but ranging from white, through pink, to deep purple. From 5 to 25 helmet-shaped flowers grow in a loose, linear bunch at the top of the single stalk. A pair of lateral sepals with prominent green, occasionally purple veins extend laterally like \"wings\", giving the orchid its name. The broad, three lobed, lower petal is pale in the center with dark spots.\n\nLeaves are lanceolate, or sometimes ovate, and grow in a rosette around the base of the plan, with some thinner leaves clasping the stem and sheathing almost up to the flowers. Leaves are green and unspotted. Plants grow to 40 cm in height.\n\nIt is similar in appearance to the early purple orchid \"Orchis mascula\", which flowers around the same time of year, but \"Anacamptis morio\" has green stripes on the two lateral sepals, and lacks the spots or blotches of the Early Purple's leaves.\n\nIndividual plants may flower for up to 17 years.\n\nThe species was first described, as \"Orchis morio\", by Carl Linnaeus, in 1753. It was transferred to the genus \"Anacamptis\" in 1997. \"Anacamptis\" comes from the Greek ανακάμτειν \"anakamptein\" which means to bend, although according to different sources it may mean to bend backward, to bend down or to bend forward. The name \"morio\" is Latin for \"clown\", which its striped and spotted flowers were held to resemble.\n\n, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts six subspecies:\n\n\nIt is a native of western Eurasia, ranging from Europe to Iran. In the British Isles it is found in central-southern England, Wales and Ireland.\n\nIt grows in unimproved grassy meadows, especially on limestone-rich soil. This species thrives where grass is cut once or twice a year after flowering is complete, or where it is grazed after flowering is complete. Cutting or mowing should not take place immediately after flowering but give time for seed dispersal.\n\nIt can grow in dry or wet grazed meadows. It can also be found in coastal grasslands, quarries, churchyards, as well as on roadsides and lawns. On the European continent it is also found in alpine pasture and in xerothermic grassland on porphyry outcrops.\n\nThe maximum altitude for this species is somewhere between 1500 and 2000m.\n\nPollination is by bees.\n\nThe flowers do not produce nectar, but can attract pollinators with their visual appearance. This nectar deception \"facilitates the mixing of pollen between different individual plants, promotes genetic diversity in the species, and has been favored evolutionarily over nectar production.\"\n\nPlants cannot establish without a mycorrhizal partner. This makes them vulnerable to chemicals, particularly fungicides, but also other chemical applications, including fertilisers, which could reduce the prevalence of particular species of fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi known to grow in association with the green-winged orchid include \"Epulorhiza repens\" (Tulasnellaceae) and \"Moniliopsis solani\" (Ceratobasidiaceae).\n\nThis species' conservation status is vulnerable and near threatened.\n\nIt is a protected species in Northern Ireland under the Wildlife (NI) Order of 1985.\n\nIn 2001 \"Anacamptis morio\" was adopted as the logo for Priory Vale, the third and final instalment in Swindon's 'Northern Expansion' project. Due to a rapid decline in the species they are protected in certain cases, although still regarded as being quite common in the Swindon area, especially Clifford Meadow, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) off Thamesdown Drive, Swindon.\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Great Blade\", he ranks fifth among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nA descendant of Guan Yu, Guan Sheng resembles his famous ancestor of the Three Kingdoms era in appearance. Eight \"chi\" and five/six \"cun\" tall, he has a flowing beard, long eyebrows, and eyes like those of a fenghuang. His weapon is a guandao, just like Guan Yu's. He is hence nicknamed \"Great Blade\". Though a talented warrior, he serves as a military inspector in a town east of Puzhou (蒲州; present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi).\n\nWhen the outlaws from Liangshan Marsh attack Daming (present-day Daming County, Hebei), Xuan Zan, a military officer in the imperial capital Dongjing, recommends Guan Sheng as the person to save the prefecture. The Imperial Tutor Cai Jing summons Guan from Puzhou and appoints him to lead the military mission. Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen serve as his deputies.\n\nUsing the strategy of \"\", Guan attacks Liangshan Marsh to force Song Jiang to withdraw from Daming to save his base. Liangshan's Zhang Heng, wanting to score point, stages a raid without permission on Guan Sheng's camp. Guan sets up a trap and captures him.\n\nSong Jiang takes his force back to Liangshan where he faces Guan Sheng. Impressed with Guan's looks and fighting skill, Song wants to win him over. He works out a plan with Huyan Zhuo, a former general who has defected, to ensnare Guan. Guan Sheng believes Huyan's claim that he has reluctantly joined Liangshan. Not smelling a rat, he follows him on a night raid on Song Jiang's camp. He is unhorsed by hooks and captured. Song Jiang treats him with great respect, deeply touching him and convincing him to join his band. Zhang Heng is freed.\n\nHearing of Guan Sheng's defection, the imperial court sends Shan Tinggui and Wei Dingguo to lead another army from Lingzhou (凌州; in present-day Dezhou, Shandong) to attack Liangshan. Guan Sheng volunteers to head off the attack with Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen. He fights Shan Tinggui in a one-on-one combat on horseback outside Lingzhou. He feigns defeat and lures Shan to pursue him. He then suddenly swings around and knocks his pursuer off horseback. Guan Sheng's sincerity wins the heart of Shan, who in turn persuades Wei Dingguo to also join Liangshan.\n\nGuan Sheng is appointed one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. Following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan, Guan Sheng participates in their campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory. He survives all the expeditions.\n\nAs a reward for his contributions, Emperor Huizong restores Guan Sheng to his former position of general.

{"id": "2060900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060900", "title": "Breakup of Yugoslavia", "text": "Breakup of Yugoslavia\n\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia occurred as a result of a series of political upheavals and conflicts during the early 1990s. After a period of political and economic crisis in the 1980s, constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia split apart, but the unresolved issues caused bitter inter-ethnic Yugoslav wars. The wars primarily affected Bosnia and Herzegovina, neighbouring parts of Croatia and, some years later, Kosovo.\n\nAfter the Allied victory in World War II, Yugoslavia was set up as a federation of six republics, with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In addition, two autonomous provinces were established within Serbia: Vojvodina and Kosovo. Each of the republics had its own branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia party and a ruling elite, and any tensions were solved on the federal level. The Yugoslav model of state organisation, as well as a \"middle way\" between planned and liberal economy, had been a relative success, and the country experienced a period of strong economic growth and relative political stability up to the 1980s, under the rule of president-for-life Josip Broz Tito. After his death in 1980, the weakened system of federal government was left unable to cope with rising economic and political challenges.\n\nIn the 1980s, Albanians of Kosovo started to demand that their autonomous province be granted the status of a constituent republic, starting with the 1981 protests. Ethnic tensions between Albanians and Kosovo Serbs remained high over the whole decade, which resulted in the growth across Yugoslavia of Serb opposition to the high autonomy of provinces and ineffective system of consensus at the federal level, which were seen as an obstacle for Serb interests. In 1987, Slobodan Milošević came to power in Serbia, and through a series of populist moves acquired \"de facto\" control over Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Montenegro, garnering a high level of support among Serbs for his centralist policies. Milošević was met with opposition by party leaders of the western republics of Slovenia and Croatia, who also advocated greater democratisation of the country in line with the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia dissolved in January 1990 along federal lines. Republican communist organisations became the separate socialist parties.\n\nDuring 1990, the socialists (former communists) lost power to ethnic separatist parties in the first multi-party elections held across the country, except in Serbia and Montenegro, where Milošević and his allies won. Nationalist rhetoric on all sides became increasingly heated. Between June 1991 and April 1992, four republics declared independence (only Serbia and Montenegro remained federated), but the status of ethnic Serbs outside Serbia and Montenegro, and that of ethnic Croats outside Croatia, remained unsolved. After a string of inter-ethnic incidents, the Yugoslav Wars ensued, first in Croatia and then, most severely, in multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina. The wars left long-term economic and political damage in the region, still felt there decades later.\n\nYugoslavia occupied a significant portion of the Balkan peninsula, including a strip of land on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, stretching southward from the Bay of Trieste in Central Europe to the mouth of Bojana as well as Lake Prespa inland, and eastward as far as the Iron Gates on the Danube and Midžor in the Balkan Mountains, thus including a large part of Southeast Europe, a region with a history of ethnic conflict.\n\nThe important elements that fostered the discord involved contemporary and historical factors, including the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the first breakup and subsequent inter-ethnic and political wars and genocide during World War II, ideas of Greater Serbia, Greater Croatia, Greater Albania, and conflicting views about Pan-Slavism, and the unilateral recognition by a newly reunited Germany of the breakaway republics.\n\nBefore World War II, major tensions arose from the first, monarchist Yugoslavia's multi-ethnic make-up and relative political and demographic domination of the Serbs. Fundamental to the tensions were the different concepts of the new state. The Croats and Slovenes envisaged a federal model where they would enjoy greater autonomy than they had as a separate crown land under Austria-Hungary. Under Austria-Hungary, both Slovenes and Croats enjoyed autonomy with free hands only in education, law, religion, and 45% of taxes. The Serbs tended to view the territories as a just reward for their support of the allies in World War I and the new state as an extension of the Kingdom of Serbia.\n\nTensions between the Croats and Serbs often erupted into open conflict, with the Serb-dominated security structure exercising oppression during elections and the assassination in national parliament of Croat political leaders, including Stjepan Radić, who opposed the Serbian monarch's absolutism. The assassination and human rights abuses were subject of concern for the Human Rights League and precipitated voices of protest from intellectuals, including Albert Einstein. It was in this environment of oppression that the radical insurgent group (later fascist dictatorship), the Ustaše were formed.\n\nDuring World War II, the country's tensions were exploited by the occupying Axis forces which established a Croat puppet state spanning much of present-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Axis powers installed the Ustaše as the leaders of the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nThe Ustaše resolved that the Serbian minority were a fifth column of Serbian expansionism, and pursued a policy of persecution against the Serbs. The policy dictated that one-third of the Serbian minority were to be killed, one-third expelled, and one-third converted to Catholicism and assimilated as Croats. Conversely, the Chetniks pursued their own campaign of persecution against non-Serbs in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Sandžak per the Moljević plan (\"On Our State and Its Borders\") and the orders issues by Draža Mihailović which included \"[t]he cleansing of all nation understandings and fighting\".\n\nBoth Croats and Muslims were recruited as soldiers by the \"SS\" (primarily in the 13th \"Waffen\" Mountain Division). At the same time, former royalist, General Milan Nedić, was installed by the Axis as head of the puppet government and local Serbs were recruited into the Gestapo and the Serbian Volunteer Corps, which was linked to the German Waffen-SS. Both quislings were confronted and eventually defeated by the communist-led, anti-fascist Partisan movement composed of members of all ethnic groups in the area, leading to the formation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe official Yugoslav post-war estimate of victims in Yugoslavia during World War II was 1,704,000. Subsequent data gathering in the 1980s by historians Vladimir Žerjavić and Bogoljub Kočović showed that the actual number of dead was about 1 million. Of that number, 330,000 to 390,000 ethnic Serbs perished from all causes in Croatia and Bosnia. These same historians also established the deaths of 192,000 to 207,000 ethnic Croats and 86,000 to 103,000 Muslims from all affiliations and causes throughout Yugoslavia.\n\nPrior to its collapse, Yugoslavia was a regional industrial power and an economic success. From 1960 to 1980, annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 6.1 percent, medical care was free, literacy was 91 percent, and life expectancy was 72 years. Prior to 1991, Yugoslavia's armed forces were amongst the best-equipped in Europe.\n\nYugoslavia was a unique state, straddling both the East and West. Moreover, its president, Josip Broz Tito, was one of the fundamental founders of the \"third world\" or \"group of 77\" which acted as an alternative to the superpowers. More importantly, Yugoslavia acted as a buffer state between the West and the Soviet Union and also prevented the Soviets from getting a toehold on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe central government's control began to be loosened due to increasing nationalist grievances and the Communist's Party's wish to support \"national self determination\". This resulted in Kosovo being turned into an autonomous region of Serbia, legislated by the 1974 constitution. This constitution broke down powers between the capital and the autonomous regions in Vojvodina (an area of Yugoslavia with a large number of ethnic minorities) and Kosovo (with a large ethnic-Albanian population).\n\nDespite the federal structure of the new Yugoslavia, there was still tension between the federalists, primarily Croats and Slovenes who argued for greater autonomy, and unitarists, primarily Serbs. The struggle would occur in cycles of protests for greater individual and national rights (such as the Croatian Spring) and subsequent repression. The 1974 constitution was an attempt to short-circuit this pattern by entrenching the federal model and formalising national rights.\n\nThe loosened control basically turned Yugoslavia into a \"de facto\" confederacy, which also placed pressure on the legitimacy of the regime within the federation. Since the late 1970s a widening gap of economic resources between the developed and underdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia severely deteriorated the federation's unity. The most developed republics, Croatia and Slovenia, rejected attempts to limit their autonomy as provided in the 1974 Constitution. Public opinion in Slovenia in 1987 saw better economic opportunity in independence from Yugoslavia than within it. There were also places that saw no economic benefit from being in Yugoslavia; for example, the autonomous province of Kosovo was poorly developed, and per capita GDP fell from 47 percent of the Yugoslav average in the immediate post-war period to 27 percent by the 1980s. It highlighted the vast differences in the quality of life in the different republics.\n\nEconomic growth was curbed due to Western trade barriers combined with the 1973 oil crisis. Yugoslavia subsequently fell into heavy IMF debt due to the large number of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans taken out by the regime. As a condition of receiving loans, the IMF demanded the \"market liberalisation\" of Yugoslavia. By 1981, Yugoslavia had incurred $19.9 billion in foreign debt. Another concern was the unemployment rate, at 1 million by 1980. This problem was compounded by the general \"unproductiveness of the South\", which not only added to Yugoslavia's economic woes, but also irritated Slovenia and Croatia further.\n\nThe SFR Yugoslavia was a conglomeration of eight federated entities, roughly divided along ethnic lines, including six republics—\n—and two autonomous provinces within Serbia,\n\nWith the 1974 Constitution, the office of President of Yugoslavia was replaced with the Yugoslav Presidency, an eight-member collective head-of-state composed of representatives from six republics and, controversially, two autonomous provinces of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina.\n\nSince the SFR Yugoslav federation was formed in 1945, the constituent Socialist Republic of Serbia (SR Serbia) included the two autonomous provinces of SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina. With the 1974 constitution, the influence of the central government of SR Serbia over the provinces was greatly reduced, which gave them long-sought autonomy. The government of SR Serbia was restricted in making and carrying out decisions that would apply to the provinces. The provinces had a vote in the Yugoslav Presidency, which was not always cast in favor of SR Serbia. In Serbia, there was great resentment towards these developments, which the nationalist elements of the public saw as the \"division of Serbia\".\nThe 1974 constitution not only exacerbated Serbian fears of a \"weak Serbia, for a strong Yugoslavia\" but also hit at the heart of Serbian national sentiment. A majority of Serbs see Kosovo as the \"cradle of the nation\", and would not accept the possibility of losing it to the majority Albanian population.\n\nIn an effort to ensure his legacy, Tito's 1974 constitution established a system of year-long presidencies, on a rotation basis out of the eight leaders of the republics and autonomous provinces. Tito's death would show that such short terms were highly ineffective. Essentially it left a power vacuum which was left open for most of the 1980s.\n\nOn 4 May 1980, Tito's death was announced through state broadcasts across Yugoslavia. His death removed what many international political observers saw as Yugoslavia's main unifying force, and subsequently ethnic tension started to grow in Yugoslavia. The crisis that emerged in Yugoslavia was connected with the weakening of the Communist states in Eastern Europe towards the end of the Cold War, leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In Yugoslavia, the national communist party, officially called the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, had lost its ideological potency.\n\nIn 1986, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) contributed significantly to the rise of nationalist sentiments, as it drafted the controversial SANU Memorandum protesting against the weakening of the Serbian central government.\n\nThe problems in the Serbian autonomous province of SAP Kosovo between ethnic Serbs and Albanians grew exponentially. This, coupled with economic problems in Kosovo and Serbia as a whole, led to even greater Serbian resentment of the 1974 Constitution. Kosovo Albanians started to demand that Kosovo be granted the status of a constituent republic beginning in the early 1980s, particularly with the 1981 protests in Kosovo. This was seen by the Serbian public as a devastating blow to Serb pride because of the historic links that Serbians held with Kosovo. It was viewed that that secession would be devastating to Kosovar Serbs. This eventually led to the repression of the Albanian majority in Kosovo.\n\nMeanwhile, the more prosperous republics of SR Slovenia and SR Croatia wanted to move towards decentralization and democracy.\n\nThe historian Basil Davidson contends that the \"recourse to 'ethnicity' as an explanation [of the conflict] is pseudo-scientific nonsense...\" Even the degree of linguistic and religious differences \"have been less substantial than instant commentators routinely tell us\". Between the two major communities, the Serbs and the Croats, Davidson argues, \"the term 'ethnic cleansing' can have no sense at all\". Davidson agrees with Susan Woodward, an expert on Balkan affairs, who found the \"motivating causes of the disintegration in economic circumstance and its ferocious pressures\".\n\nAs President, Tito's policy was to push for rapid economic growth, and growth was indeed high in the 1970s. However, the over-expansion of the economy caused inflation and pushed Yugoslavia into economic recession.\n\nA major problem for Yugoslavia was the heavy debt incurred in the 1970s, which proved to be difficult to repay in the 1980s. Yugoslavia's debt load, initially estimated at a sum equal to $6 billion U.S dollars, instead turned to be equal to sum equivalent to $21 billion U.S. dollars, which was a colossal sum for a poor country. In 1984 the Reagan administration issued a classified document, National Security Decision Directive 133, expressing concern that Yugoslavia's debt load might cause the country to align with the Soviet bloc. The 1980s were a time of economic austerity as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) imposed stringent conditions on Yugoslavia, which caused much resentment toward the Communist elites who had so mismanaged the economy by recklessly borrowing of money abroad. The policies of austerity also led to uncovering much corruption by the elites, most notably with the \"Agrokomerc affair\" of 1987, when the Agrokomerc enterprise of Bosnia turned out to be the centre of a vast nexus of corruption running all across Yugoslavia, and that the managers of Agrokomerc had issued promissory notes equivalent to $500 US dollars without collateral, forcing the state to assume responsibility for their debts when Agrokomerc finally collapsed. The rampant corruption in Yugoslavia, of which the \"Agrokomerc affair\" was merely the most dramatic example, did much to discredit the Communist system, as it was revealed that the elites were living luxurious lifestyles well beyond the means of ordinary people with money stolen from the public purse, in a time of austerity. The problems imposed by heavy indebtedness and corruption had by the mid-1980s increasingly started to corrode the legitimacy of the Communist system as ordinary people started to lose faith in the competence and honesty of the elites.\n\nA wave of major strikes developed in 1987-88 as workers demanded higher wages to compensate for inflation, as the IMF mandated the end of various subsidies, and they were accompanied by denunciations of the entire system as corrupt. Finally, the politics of austerity brought to the fore tensions between the well off \"have\" republics like Slovenia and Croatia versus the poorer \"have not\" republics like Serbia. Both Croatia and Slovenia felt that they were paying too much money into the federal budget to support the \"have not\" republics, while Serbia wanted Croatia and Slovenia to pay more money into the federal budget to support them at a time of austerity. Increasingly, demands were voiced in Serbia for more centralisation in order to force Croatia and Slovenia to pay more into the federal budget, demands that were completely rejected in the \"have\" republics.\n\nThe relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union after Mikhail Gorbachev became leader in 1985 meant that western nations were no longer willing to be generous with restructuring Yugoslavia's debts, as the example of a communist country outside of the Soviet bloc was no longer needed by the West as a way of destabilising the Soviet bloc. The external status quo, which the Communist Party had depended upon to remain viable, was thus beginning to disappear. Furthermore, the failure of communism all over Central and Eastern Europe once again brought to the surface Yugoslavia's inner contradictions, economic inefficiencies (such as chronic lack of productivity, fuelled by the country's leaderships' decision to enforce a policy of full employment), and ethno-religious tensions. Yugoslavia's non-aligned status resulted in access to loans from both superpower blocs. This contact with the United States and the West opened up Yugoslavia's markets sooner than the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. The 1980s were a decade of Western economic ministrations.\n\nA decade of frugality resulted in growing frustration and resentment against both the Serbian \"ruling class\", and the minorities who were seen to benefit from government legislation. Real earnings in Yugoslavia fell by 25% from 1979 to 1985. By 1988 emigrant remittances to Yugoslavia totalled over $4.5 billion (USD), and by 1989 remittances were $6.2 billion (USD), making up over 19% of the world's total.\n\nIn 1990, US policy insisted on the shock therapy austerity programme that was meted out to the ex-Comecon countries. Such a programme had been advocated by the IMF and other organisations \"as a condition for fresh injections of capital.\"\n\nIn 1987, Serbian communist official Slobodan Milošević was sent to bring calm to an ethnically-driven protest by Serbs against the Albanian administration of SAP Kosovo. Milošević had been, up to this point, a hard-line communist who had decried all forms of nationalism as treachery, such as condemning the SANU Memorandum as \"nothing else but the darkest nationalism\". However, Kosovo's autonomy had always been an unpopular policy in Serbia, and he took advantage of the situation and made a departure from traditional communist neutrality on the issue of Kosovo.\n\nMilošević assured Serbs that their mistreatment by ethnic Albanians would be stopped. He then began a campaign against the ruling communist elite of SR Serbia, demanding reductions in the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. These actions made him popular amongst Serbs and aided his rise to power in Serbia. Milošević and his allies took on an aggressive nationalist agenda of reviving SR Serbia within Yugoslavia, promising reforms and protection of all Serbs.\n\nThe ruling party of SFR Yugoslavia was the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), a composite political party made-up of eight Leagues of Communists from the six republics and two autonomous provinces. The League of Communists of Serbia (SKS) governed SR Serbia. Riding the wave of nationalist sentiment and his new popularity gained in Kosovo, Slobodan Milošević (Chairman of the League of Communists of Serbia (SKS) since May 1986) became the most powerful politician in Serbia by defeating his former mentor President of Serbia Ivan Stambolic at the 8th Session of the League of Communists of Serbia on 22 September 1987. At a 1988 rally in Belgrade, Milošević made clear his perception of the situation facing SR Serbia in Yugoslavia, saying:\n\nOn another occasion, he privately stated:\n\nThe Anti-bureaucratic revolution was a series of protests in Serbia and Montenegro orchestrated by Milošević to put his supporters in SAP Vojvodina, SAP Kosovo, and the Socialist Republic of Montenegro (SR Montenegro) to power as he sought to oust his rivals.\nThe government of Montenegro survived a coup d'état in October 1988, but not a second one in January 1989.\n\nIn addition to Serbia itself, Milošević could now install representatives of the two provinces and SR Montenegro in the Yugoslav Presidency Council. The very instrument that reduced Serbian influence before was now used to increase it: in the eight member Presidency, Milošević could count on a minimum of four votes – SR Montenegro (following local events), his own through SR Serbia, and now SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo as well. In a series of rallies, called \"Rallies of Truth\", Milošević's supporters succeeded in overthrowing local governments and replacing them with his allies.\n\nAs a result of these events, in February 1989 ethnic Albanian miners in Kosovo organized a strike, demanding the preservation of the now-endangered autonomy. This contributed to ethnic conflict between the Albanian and Serb populations of the province. At 77% of the population of Kosovo in the 1980s, ethnic-Albanians were the majority.\n\nIn June 1989, the 600th anniversary of Serbia's historic defeat at the field of Kosovo, Slobodan Milošević gave the Gazimestan speech to 200,000 Serbs, with a Serb nationalist theme which deliberately evoked medieval Serbian history. Milošević's answer to the incompetence of the federal system was to centralise the government. Considering Slovenia and Croatia were looking farther ahead to independence, this was considered unacceptable.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socialist Republic of Croatia (SR Croatia) and the Socialist Republic of Slovenia (SR Slovenia), supported the Albanian miners and their struggle for recognition. Media in SR Slovenia published articles comparing Milošević to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Milošević contended that such criticism was unfounded and amounted to \"spreading fear of Serbia\". Milošević's state-run media claimed in response that Milan Kučan, head of the League of Communists of Slovenia, was endorsing Kosovo and Slovene separatism. Initial strikes in Kosovo turned into widespread demonstrations calling for Kosovo to be made the seventh republic. This angered Serbia's leadership which proceeded to use police force, and later the federal army (the Yugoslav People's Army JNA) by order of the Serbian-controlled Presidency.\n\nIn February 1989 ethnic Albanian Azem Vllasi, SAP Kosovo's representative on the Presidency, was forced to resign and was replaced by an ally of Milošević. Albanian protesters demanded that Vllasi be returned to office, and Vllasi's support for the demonstrations caused Milošević and his allies to respond stating this was a \"counter-revolution against Serbia and Yugoslavia\", and demanded that the federal Yugoslav government put down the striking Albanians by force. Milošević's aim was aided when a huge protest was formed outside of the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade by Serb supporters of Milošević who demanded that the Yugoslav military forces make their presence stronger in Kosovo to protect the Serbs there and put down the strike.\n\nOn 27 February, SR Slovene representative in the collective presidency of Yugoslavia, Milan Kučan, opposed the demands of the Serbs and left Belgrade for SR Slovenia where he attended a meeting in the Cankar Hall in Ljubljana, co-organized with the democratic opposition forces, publicly endorsing the efforts of Albanian protesters who demanded that Vllasi be released. In the 1995 BBC documentary \"The Death of Yugoslavia\", Kučan claimed that in 1989, he was concerned that with the successes of Milošević's anti-bureaucratic revolution in Serbia's provinces as well as Montenegro, that his small republic would be the next target for a political coup by Milošević's supporters if the coup in Kosovo went unimpeded. Serbian state-run television denounced Kučan as a separatist, a traitor, and an endorser of Albanian separatism.\n\nSerb protests continued in Belgrade demanding action in Kosovo. Milošević instructed communist representative Petar Gračanin to make sure the protest continued while he discussed matters at the council of the League of Communists, as a means to induce the other members to realize that enormous support was on his side in putting down the Albanian strike in Kosovo. Serbian parliament speaker Borisav Jović, a strong ally of Milošević, met with the current President of the Yugoslav Presidency, Bosnian representative Raif Dizdarević, and demanded that the federal government concede to Serbian demands. Dizdarević argued with Jović saying that \"You [Serbian politicians] organized the demonstrations, you control it\", Jović refused to take responsibility for the actions of the protesters. Dizdarević then decided to attempt to bring calm to the situation himself by talking with the protesters, by making an impassioned speech for unity of Yugoslavia saying:\n\nThis statement received polite applause, but the protest continued. Later Jović spoke to the crowds with enthusiasm and told them that Milošević was going to arrive to support their protest. When Milošević arrived, he spoke to the protesters and jubilantly told them that the people of Serbia were winning their fight against the old party bureaucrats. Then a shout to be from the crowd yelled \"arrest Vllasi'\". Milošević pretended not to hear the demand correctly but declared to the crowd that anyone conspiring against the unity of Yugoslavia would be arrested and punished and the next day, with the party council pushed to submission to Serbia, Yugoslav army forces poured into Kosovo and Vllasi was arrested.\n\nIn March 1989, the crisis in Yugoslavia deepened after the adoption of amendments to the Serbian constitution that allowed the Serbian republic's government to re-assert effective power over the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Up until that time, a number of political decisions were legislated from within these provinces, and they had a vote on the Yugoslav federal presidency level (six members from the republics and two members from the autonomous provinces).\n\nA group of Kosovo Serb supporters of Milošević who helped bring down Vllasi declared that they were going to Slovenia to hold \"the Rally of Truth\" which would decry Milan Kučan as a traitor to Yugoslavia and demand his ousting. However, the attempt to replay the anti-bureaucratic revolution in Ljubljana in December 1989 failed: the Serb protesters who were to go by train to Slovenia, were stopped when the police of SR Croatia blocked all transit through its territory in coordination with the Slovene police forces.\n\nIn the Presidency of Yugoslavia, Serbia's Borisav Jović (at the time the President of the Presidency), Montenegro's Nenad Bućin, Vojvodina's Jugoslav Kostić and Kosovo's Riza Sapunxhiu, started to form a voting bloc.\n\nIn January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was convened. The combined Yugoslav ruling party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), was in crisis. Most of the Congress was spent with the Serbian and Slovene delegations arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. SR Croatia prevented Serb protesters from reaching Slovenia. The Serbian delegation, led by Milošević, insisted on a policy of \"one person, one vote\" in the party membership, which would empower the largest party ethnic group, the Serbs.\n\nIn turn, the Croats and Slovenes sought to reform Yugoslavia by delegating even more power to six republics, but were voted down continuously in every motion and attempt to force the party to adopt the new voting system. As a result, the Croatian delegation, led by Chairman Ivica Račan, and Slovene delegation left the Congress on 23 January 1990, effectively dissolving the all-Yugoslav party. Along with external pressure, this caused the adoption of multi-party systems in all the republics.\n\nThe individual republics organized multi-party elections in 1990, and the former communists mostly failed to win re-election, while most of the elected governments took on nationalist platforms, promising to protect their separate nationalist interests. In multi-party parliamentary elections nationalists defeated re-branded former Communist parties in Slovenia on 8 April 1990, in Croatia on 22 April and 2 May 1990, in Macedonia 11 and 25 November and 9 December 1990, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 18 and 25 November 1990.\n\nIn multi-party parliamentary elections, re-branded former communist parties were victorious in Montenegro on 9 and 16 December 1990, and in Serbia on 9 and 23 December 1990. In addition Serbia re-elected Slobodan Milošević as President. Serbia and Montenegro now increasingly favored a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.\n\nIn Croatia, the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was elected to power, led by controversial nationalist Franjo Tuđman, under the promise of \"protecting Croatia from Milošević\", publicly advocating Croatian sovereignty. Croatian Serbs were wary of Tuđman's nationalist government, and in 1990 Serb nationalists in the southern Croatian town of Knin organized and formed a separatist entity known as the SAO Krajina, which demanded to remain in union with the rest of the Serb population if Croatia decided to secede. The government of Serbia endorsed the rebellion of the Croatian Serbs, claiming that for Serbs, rule under Tuđman's government would be equivalent to the World War II era fascist Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which committed genocide against Serbs. Milošević used this to rally Serbs against the Croatian government and Serbian newspapers joined in the warmongering. Serbia had by now printed $1.8 billion worth of new money without any backing of the Yugoslav central bank.\n\nCroatian Serbs in Knin, under the leadership of local police inspector Milan Martić, began to try to gain access to weapons so that the Croatian Serbs could mount a successful revolt against the Croatian government. Croatian Serb politicians including the Mayor of Knin met with Borisav Jović, the head of the Yugoslav Presidency in August 1990, and urged him to push the council to take action to prevent Croatia from separating from Yugoslavia, because they claimed that the Serb population would be in danger in Croatia which was ruled by Tuđman and his nationalist government.\n\nAt the meeting, army official Petar Gračanin told the Croatian Serb politicians how to organize their rebellion, telling them to put up barricades, as well as assemble weapons of any sort, saying \"If you can't get anything else, use hunting rifles\". Initially the revolt became known as the \"Log Revolution\", as Serbs blockaded roadways to Knin with cut-down trees and prevented Croats from entering Knin or the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. The BBC documentary \"The Death of Yugoslavia\" revealed that at the time, Croatian TV dismissed the \"Log Revolution\" as the work of drunken Serbs, trying to diminish the serious dispute. However, the blockade was damaging to Croatian tourism. The Croatian government refused to negotiate with the Serb separatists and decided to stop the rebellion by force, sending in armed special forces by helicopters to put down the rebellion.\n\nThe pilots claimed they were bringing \"equipment\" to Knin, but the federal Yugoslav air force intervened and sent fighter jets to intercept them and demanded that the helicopters return to their base or they would be fired upon, in which the Croatian forces obliged and returned to their base in Zagreb. To the Croatian government, this action by the Yugoslav air force revealed to them that the Yugoslav People's Army was increasingly under Serbian control. SAO Krajina was officially declared a separate entity on 21 December 1990 by the Serbian National Council which was headed by Milan Babić.\n\nIn August 1990 the Croatian Parliament replaced its representative Stipe Šuvar with Stjepan Mesić in the wake of the Log Revolution. Mesić was only seated in October 1990 because of protests from the Serbian side, and then joined Macedonia's Vasil Tupurkovski, Slovenia's Janez Drnovšek and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Bogić Bogićević in opposing the demands to proclaim a general state of emergency, which would have allowed the Yugoslav People's Army to impose martial law.\n\nFollowing the first multi-party election results, the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose federation of six republics in the autumn of 1990, however Milošević rejected all such proposals, arguing that like Slovenes and Croats, the Serbs also had a right to self-determination. Serbian politicians were alarmed by a change of phrasing in the Christmas Constitution of Croatia that changed the status of ethnic Serbs of Croatia from an explicitly mentioned nation (\"narod\") to a nation listed together with minorities (\"narodi i manjine\").\n\nIn the 1990 Slovenian independence referendum, held on 23 December 1990, a vast majority of residents voted for independence: 88.5% of all electors (94.8% of those participating) voted for independence, which was declared on 25 June 1991.\n\nIn January 1991, the Yugoslav counter-intelligence service, KOS (\"Kontraobaveštajna služba\"), displayed a video of a secret meeting (the \"Špegelj Tapes\") that they purported had happened some time in 1990 between the Croatian Defence Minister, Martin Špegelj, and two other men. Špegelj announced during the meeting that Croatia was at war with the Yugoslav army (JNA, \"Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija\") and gave instructions about arms smuggling as well as methods of dealing with the Army's officers stationed in Croatian cities. The Army subsequently wanted to indict Špegelj for treason and illegal importation of arms, mainly from Hungary.\n\nThe discovery of Croatian arms smuggling combined with the crisis in Knin, the election of independence-leaning governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Slovenia, and Slovenes demanding independence in the referendum on the issue suggested that Yugoslavia faced the imminent threat of disintegration.\n\nOn 1 March 1991, the Pakrac clash ensued, and the JNA was deployed to the scene. On 9 March 1991, protests in Belgrade were suppressed with the help of the Army.\n\nOn 12 March 1991, the leadership of the Army met with the Presidency in an attempt to convince them to declare a state of emergency which would allow for the pan-Yugoslav army to take control of the country. Yugoslav army chief Veljko Kadijević declared that there was a conspiracy to destroy the country, saying:\n\nThis statement effectively implied that the new independence-advocating governments of the republics were seen by Serbs as tools of the West. Croatian delegate Stjepan Mesić responded angrily to the proposal, accusing Jović and Kadijević of attempting to use the army to create a Greater Serbia and declared \"That means war!\". Jović and Kadijević then called upon the delegates of each republic to vote on whether to allow martial law, and warned them that Yugoslavia would likely fall apart if martial law was not introduced.\n\nIn the meeting, a vote was taken on a proposal to enact martial law to allow for military action to end the crisis in Croatia by providing protection for the Serbs. The proposal was rejected as the Bosnian delegate Bogić Bogićević voted against it, believing that there was still the possibility of diplomacy being able to solve the crisis.\n\nThe Yugoslav presidential crisis reached an impasse when Kosovo's Riza Sapunxhiu 'defected' his faction in the second vote on martial law in March 1991.\nJović briefly resigned from the presidency in protest, but soon returned. On 16 May 1991, the Serbian parliament replaced Sapunxhiu with Sejdo Bajramović, and Vojvodina's Nenad Bućin with Jugoslav Kostić. This effectively deadlocked the Presidency, because Milošević's Serbian faction had secured four out of eight federal presidency votes, and it was able to block any unfavorable decisions at the federal level, in turn causing objections from other republics and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.\n\nAfter Jović's term as head of the collective presidency expired, he blocked his successor, Mesić, from taking the position, giving the position instead to Branko Kostić, a member of the pro-Milošević government in Montenegro.\n\nIn the Croatian independence referendum held on 2 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence. On 19 May 1991, the second round of the referendum on the structure of the Yugoslav federation was held in Croatia. The phrasing of the question did not explicitly inquire as to whether one was in favor of secession or not. The referendum asked the voter if he or she was in favor of Croatia being \"able to enter into an alliance of sovereign states with other republics (in accordance with the proposal of the republics of Croatia and Slovenia for solving the state crisis in the SFRY)?\". 83.56% of the voters turned out, with Croatian Serbs largely boycotting the referendum. Of these, 94.17% (78.69% of the total voting population) voted \"in favor\" of the proposal, while 1.2% of those who voted were \"opposed\". Finally, the independence of Croatia was declared on 25 June 1991.\n\nBoth Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on 25 June 1991. On the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People's Army's 13th Corps left their barracks in Rijeka, Croatia, to move towards Slovenia's borders with Italy. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the YPA's actions. There was no fighting, as yet, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire.\n\nBy this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of both the international Ljubljana Airport and Slovenia's border posts on borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. By taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected YPA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot, which was fired on 27 June at 14:30 in Divača by an officer of the YPA.\n\nWhilst supportive of their respective rights to national self-determination, the European Community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month moratorium on their independence, and reached the Brijuni Agreement on 7 July 1991 (recognized by representatives of all republics). During these three months, the Yugoslav Army completed its pull-out from Slovenia. Negotiations to restore the Yugoslav federation with diplomat Lord Carrington and members of the European Community were all but ended. Carrington's plan realized that Yugoslavia was in a state of dissolution and decided that each republic must accept the inevitable independence of the others, along with a promise to Serbian President Milošević that the European Union would ensure that Serbs outside of Serbia would be protected.\n\nLord Carrington's opinions were rendered moot following newly reunited Germany's Christmas Eve 1991 recognition of Slovenia and Croatia. Except for secret negotiations between foreign ministers Genscher (Germany) and Mock (Austria), the unilateral recognition came as an unwelcome surprise to most EU governments and the United States, with whom there was no prior consultation. International organisations, including the UN, were nonplussed. While Yugoslavia was already in a shambles, it's likely that German recognition of the breakaway republics—and Austrian partial mobilization on the border—made things a good deal worse for the decomposing multinational state. US President George H.W. Bush was the only major power representative to voice an objection. The extent of Vatican and Federal Intelligence Agency of Germany (BND) intervention in this episode has been explored by scholars familiar with the details, but the historical record remains disputed.\nMilošević refused to agree to the plan, as he claimed that the European Community had no right to dissolve Yugoslavia and that the plan was not in the interests of Serbs as it would divide the Serb people into four republics (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia). Carrington responded by putting the issue to a vote in which all the other republics, including Montenegro under Momir Bulatović, initially agreed to the plan that would dissolve Yugoslavia. However, after intense pressure from Serbia on Montenegro's President, Montenegro changed its position to oppose the dissolution of Yugoslavia.\n\nWith the Plitvice Lakes incident of late March/early April 1991, the Croatian War of Independence broke out between the Croatian government and the rebel ethnic Serbs of the SAO Krajina (heavily backed by the by-now Serb-controlled Yugoslav People's Army). On 1 April 1991, the SAO Krajina declared that it would secede from Croatia. Immediately after Croatia's declaration of independence, Croatian Serbs also formed the SAO Western Slavonia and the SAO of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem. These three regions would combine into the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991.\n\nThe other significant Serb-dominated entities in eastern Croatia announced that they too would join SAO Krajina. Zagreb had by this time discontinued submitting tax money to Belgrade, and the Croatian Serb entities in turn halted paying taxes to Zagreb. In some places, the Yugoslav Army acted as a buffer zone, in others it aided Serbs in their confrontation with the new Croatian army and police forces.\n\nThe influence of xenophobia and ethnic hatred in the collapse of Yugoslavia became clear during the war in Croatia. Propaganda by Croatian and Serbian sides spread fear, claiming that the other side would engage in oppression against them and would exaggerate death tolls to increase support from their populations. In the beginning months of the war, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and navy deliberately shelled civilian areas of Split and Dubrovnik, a UNESCO world heritage site, as well as nearby Croat villages. Yugoslav media claimed that the actions were done due to what they claimed was a presence of fascist Ustaše forces and international terrorists in the city.\n\nUN investigations found that no such forces were in Dubrovnik at the time. Croatian military presence increased later on. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović, at the time an ally of Milošević, appealed to Montenegrin nationalism, promising that the capture of Dubrovnik would allow the expansion of Montenegro into the city which he claimed was historically part of Montenegro, and denounced the present borders of Montenegro as being \"drawn by the old and poorly educated Bolshevik cartographers\".\n\nAt the same time, the Serbian government contradicted its Montenegrin allies by claims by the Serbian Prime Minister Dragutin Zelenović contended that Dubrovnik was historically Serbian, not Montenegrin. The international media gave immense attention to bombardment of Dubrovnik and claimed this was evidence of Milosevic pursuing the creation of a Greater Serbia as Yugoslavia collapsed, presumably with the aid of the subordinate Montenegrin leadership of Bulatović and Serb nationalists in Montenegro to foster Montenegrin support for the retaking of Dubrovnik.\n\nIn Vukovar, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs exploded into violence when the Yugoslav army entered the town. The Yugoslav army and Serbian paramilitaries devastated the town in urban warfare and the destruction of Croatian property. Serb paramilitaries committed atrocities against Croats, killing over 200, and displacing others to add to those who fled the town in the Vukovar massacre.\n\nWith Bosnia's demographic structure comprising a mixed population of a majority of Bosniaks, and minorities of Serbs and Croats, the ownership of large areas of Bosnia was in dispute.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992, the situation in the multiethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina grew tense. Its parliament was fragmented on ethnic lines into a plurality Bosniak faction and minority Serb and Croat factions. In 1991, Radovan Karadžić, the leader of the largest Serb faction in the parliament, the Serb Democratic Party, gave a grave and direct warning to the Bosnian parliament should it decide to separate, saying:\n\nIn the meantime, behind the scenes, negotiations began between Milošević and Tuđman to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into Serb and Croat administered territories to attempt to avert war between Bosnian Croats and Serbs. Bosnian Serbs held a referendum in November 1991 resulting in an overwhelming vote in favor of staying in a common state with Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nIn public, pro-state media in Serbia claimed to Bosnians that Bosnia and Herzegovina could be included a new voluntary union within a new Yugoslavia based on democratic government, but this was not taken seriously by Bosnia and Herzegovina's government.\n\nOn 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb assembly proclaimed a separate Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the soon-to-be Republic of Srpska), and proceeded to form Serbian autonomous regions (SARs) throughout the state. The Serbian referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia and the creation of SARs were proclaimed unconstitutional by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nA referendum on independence sponsored by the Bosnian government was held on 29 February and 1 March 1992. The referendum was declared contrary to the Bosnian and federal constitution by the federal Constitution Court and the newly established Bosnian Serb government, and it was largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. According to the official results, the turnout was 63.4%, and 99.7% of the voters voted for independence. It was unclear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992 and received international recognition the following month on 6 April 1992. On the same date, the Serbs responded by declaring the independence of the Republika Srpska and laying siege to Sarajevo, which marked the start of the Bosnian War. The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was subsequently admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 22 May 1992.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO used its military means to significantly help Bošnjaci (Muslims) and Croats with forcing Serbs to sign the peace agreement in Dayton, Ohio (November 1995). During this war, around 100,000 people were killed in the territory of Bosnian and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the Macedonian independence referendum held on 8 September 1991, 95.26% voted for independence, which was declared on 25 September 1991.\n\nFive hundred US soldiers were then deployed under the UN banner to monitor Macedonia's northern border with Serbia. However, Belgrade's authorities neither intervened to prevent Macedonia's departure, nor protested nor acted against the arrival of the UN troops, indicating that once Belgrade was to form its new country (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in April 1992), it would recognise the Republic of Macedonia and develop diplomatic relations with it. As a result, Macedonia became the only former republic to gain sovereignty without resistance from the Yugoslav authorities and Army.\n\nIn addition, Macedonia's first president, Kiro Gligorov, did indeed maintain good relations with Belgrade as well as the other former republics. There have been no problems between Macedonian and Serbian border police, even though small pockets of Kosovo and the Preševo valley complete the northern reaches of the historical region known as Macedonia, which would otherwise have created a border dispute (see also IMORO).\n\nThe Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia, the last major conflict being between Albanian nationalists and the government of Republic of Macedonia, reduced in violence after 2001.\n\nIn November 1991, the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, led by Robert Badinter, concluded at the request of Lord Carrington that the SFR Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution, that the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia did not have a right to self-determination in the form of new states, and that the borders between the republics were to be recognized as international borders. As a result of the conflict, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 721 on 27 November 1991, which paved the way to the establishment of peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia.\n\nIn January 1992, Croatia and Yugoslavia signed an armistice under UN supervision, while negotiations continued between Serb and Croat leaderships over the partitioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the independence of Croatia and Slovenia was recognized by the international community. Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina would later be admitted as member states of the United Nations on 22 May 1992. Macedonia was admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 8 April 1993; its membership approval took longer than the others due to Greek objections.\n\nIn 1999 Social Democratic Party of Germany in his May Day speech leader Oskar Lafontaine criticised the role played by Germany in the break up of Yugoslavia, with its early recognition of the independence of the republics.\n\nSome observers opined that the break up of the Yugoslav state violated the principles of post-Cold War system, enshrined in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE/OSCE) and the Treaty of Paris of 1990. Both stipulated that inter-state borders in Europe should not be changed. Some observers, such as Peter Gowan, assert that the breakup and subsequent conflict could have been prevented if western states were more assertive in enforcing internal arrangements between all parties, but ultimately \"were not prepared to enforce such principles in the Yugoslav case because Germany did not want to and the other states did not have any strategic interest in doing so.\" Gowan even contends that the break-up \"might have been possible without great bloodshed if clear criteria could have been established for providing security for all the main groups of people within the Yugoslav space.\"\n\nIn March 1992, during the US-Bosnian independence campaign, the politician and future president of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović reached an EC brokered agreement with Bosnian Croats and Serbs on a three-canton confederal settlement. But, the US government, according to the \"New York Times\", urged him to opt for a unitary, sovereign, independent state. This made the probability of an awful civil war higher, and in which both Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs would gather support from their respective states.\n\nThe independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina proved to be the final blow to the pan-Yugoslav Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 April 1992, the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was formed as a rump state, consisting only of the former Socialist Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. The FRY was dominated by Slobodan Milošević and his political allies. Its government claimed continuity to the former country, but the international community refused to recognize it as such. The stance of the international community was that Yugoslavia had dissolved into its separate states. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was prevented by a UN resolution on 22 September 1992 from continuing to occupy the United Nations seat as successor state to SFRY. This question was important for claims on SFRY's international assets, including embassies in many countries. The FRY did not abandon its claim to continuity from the SFRY until 1996.\n\nThe war in the western parts of former Yugoslavia ended in 1995 with US-sponsored peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, which resulted in the Dayton Agreement. The five years of disintegration and war led to a sanctions regime, causing the economy to collapse. The Kosovo War started in 1996 and ended with the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia; Slobodan Milošević was overthrown in 2000.\n\nThe FR Yugoslavia was renamed on 4 February 2003 as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was itself unstable, and finally broke up in 2006 when, in a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegrin independence was backed by 55.5% of voters, and independence was declared on 3 June 2006. Serbia inherited the State Union's UN membership.\n\nKosovo had been administered by the UN since the Kosovo War while nominally remaining part of Serbia. However, on 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia as the Republic of Kosovo. The United States, the United Kingdom and much of the European Union recognized this as an act of self determination, with the United States sending people to help assist Kosovo. On the other hand, Serbia and some of the international community—most notably Russia, Spain and China—have not recognised Kosovo's declaration of independence. As of July 2015, Kosovo is recognized as an independent state by a simple majority of the international community (56% of the United Nations' member states).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2060912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060912", "title": "Backward induction", "text": "Backward induction\n\nBackward induction is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to determine a sequence of optimal actions. It proceeds by first considering the last time a decision might be made and choosing what to do in any situation at that time. Using this information, one can then determine what to do at the second-to-last time of decision. This process continues backwards until one has determined the best action for every possible situation (i.e. for every possible information set) at every point in time. It was first used by Zermelo in 1913, to prove that chess has pure optimal strategies.\n\nIn the mathematical optimization method of dynamic programming, backward induction is one of the main methods for solving the Bellman equation. In game theory, backward induction is a method used to compute subgame perfect equilibria in sequential games. The only difference is that optimization involves just one decision maker, who chooses what to do at each point of time, whereas game theory analyzes how the decisions of several players interact. That is, by anticipating what the last player will do in each situation, it is possible to determine what the second-to-last player will do, and so on. In the related fields of automated planning and scheduling and automated theorem proving, the method is called backward search or backward chaining. In chess it is called retrograde analysis.\n\nBackward induction has been used to solve games as long as the field of game theory has existed. John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern suggested solving zero-sum, two-person games by backward induction in their \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" (1944), the book which established game theory as a field of study.\n\nConsider an unemployed person who will be able to work for ten more years \"t\" = 1,2...,10. Suppose that each year in which he remains unemployed, he may be offered a 'good' job that pays $100, or a 'bad' job that pays $44, with equal probability (50/50). Once he accepts a job, he will remain in that job for the rest of the ten years. (Assume for simplicity that he cares only about his monetary earnings, and that he values earnings at different times equally, i.e., the discount rate is zero.)\n\nShould this person accept bad jobs? To answer this question, we can reason backwards from time \"t\" = 10.\n\nIt can be verified by continuing to work backwards that bad offers should only be accepted if one is still unemployed at times 9 or 10; they should be rejected at all times up to \"t\" = 8. The intuition is that if one expects to work in a job for a long time, this makes it more valuable to be picky about what job to accept.\n\nA dynamic optimization problem of this kind is called an optimal stopping problem, because the issue at hand is when to stop waiting for a better offer. Search theory is the field of microeconomics that applies problems of this type to contexts like shopping, job search, and marriage.\n\nIn game theory, backward induction is a solution concept. It is a refinement of the rationality concept that are sensitive to individual information sets in the extensive-form representation of a game . The idea of backward induction utilize sequential rationality by identifying an optimal action for each information in a given game tree.\n\nIn “Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory” by Joel Watson, Backward induction procedure is defined as:“The process of analyzing a game from the end to the beginning. At each decision node, one strikes from consideration any actions that are dominated, given the terminal nodes that can be reached through the play of the actions identified at successor nodes.” .\n\nOne drawback of backward induction procedure is that it can be applied to only limited classes of games. The procedure is well defined for any game of perfect information with no ties of utility. It is also well defined and meaningful for game of perfect information with ties. However, it leads to more than one strategy profile. The procedure can be applied to some games with nontrivial information sets but it is unreliable in general. The procedure is best suited to solve games with perfect information. (Watson pg.188)\n\nThe backward induction procedure can be demonstrated with a simple example.\n\nThe proposed game is a multi-stage game involving 2 players. Players are planning to go to a movie. Currently, there are 2 movies that are very popular, Joker and Terminator. Player 1 wants to watch Terminator and Player 2 wants to watch Joker. The Player 1 will buy a ticket first and tell Player 2 about her choice. Then, Player 2 will buy his ticket. Once they both observe the choices, they will make choices on whether to go to the movie or stay home. Just like the first stage, Player 1 chooses first. Player 2 then makes his choice after observing Player 1’s choice. \n\nFor this example, we assume payoffs are added across different stages. The game is a perfect information game.\n\nNormal-form Matrix:\n\nExtensive-form Representation:\n\nSteps for solving this Multi-Stage Game, with the extensive form as see to the right:\n\nBackward induction is ‘the process of analyzing a game from the end to the beginning. As with solving for other Nash Equilibria, rationality of players and complete knowledge is assumed. The concept of backwards induction corresponds to this assumption that it is common knowledge that each player will act rationally with each decision node when she chooses an option — even if her rationality would imply that such a node will not be reached.’ \n\nIn order to solve for a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium with backwards induction, the game should be written out in extensive form and then divided into subgames. Starting with the subgame furthest from the initial node, or starting point, the expected payoffs listed for this subgame are weighed and the rational player will select the option with the higher payoff for themselves. The highest payoff vector is selected and marked. Solve for the subgame perfect equilibrium by continually working backwards from subgame to subgame until arriving at the starting point. The marked path of vectors is the subgame perfect equilibrium.\n\nBackward Induction Applied to the Ultimatum Game\n\nThink of a game between two players where player 1 proposes to split a dollar with player 2. This is a famous, asymmetric game that is played sequentially called the ultimatum game. player one acts first by splitting the dollar however they see fit. Now, player two can either accept the portion they have been dealt by player one or reject the split. If player 2 accepts the split, then both player 1 and player 2 get the payoff according to that split. If player two decides to reject player 1’s offer, then both players get nothing. In other words, player 2 has veto power over player 1’s proposed allocation but applying the veto eliminates any reward for both players. The strategy profile for this game therefore can be written as pairs (x, f(x)) for all x between 0 and 1, where f(x)) is a bi-valued function expressing whether x is accepted or not.\n\nConsider the choice and response of player 2 given any arbitrary proposal by player 1, assuming that the offer is larger than $0. Using backward induction, surely we would expect player 2 to accept any payoff that is greater than or equal to $0. Accordingly, player 1 ought to propose giving player 2 as little as possible in order to gain the largest portion of the split. player 1 giving player 2 the smallest unit of money and keeping the rest for him/herself is the unique sub game perfect equilibrium. The ultimatum game does have several other Nash Equilibria which are not subgame perfect and therefore do not require backward induction.\n\nThe ultimatum game is an illustration of the usefulness of backward induction when considering infinite games; however, the game’s theoretically predicted results of the game are criticized. Empirical, experimental evidence has shown that the proposer very rarely offers $0 and player 2 sometimes even rejects offers greater than $0, presumably on grounds of fairness. What is deemed fair by player 2 varies by context and the pressure or presence of other players can mean that the game theoretic model can not necessarily predict what real people will choose. \n\nIn practice, subgame perfect equilibrium is not always achieved. According to Camerer, an American behavioral economist, player 2 “rejects offers of less than 20 percent of X about half the time, even though they end up with nothing.” While backward induction would predict that the responder accepts any offer equal to or greater than zero, responders in reality are not rational players and therefore seem to care more about offer ‘fairness’ rather than potential monetary gains.\n\nSee also centipede game.\n\nConsider a dynamic game in which the players are an incumbent firm in an industry and a potential entrant to that industry. As it stands, the incumbent has a monopoly over the industry and does not want to lose some of its market share to the entrant. If the entrant chooses not to enter, the payoff to the incumbent is high (it maintains its monopoly) and the entrant neither loses nor gains (its payoff is zero). If the entrant enters, the incumbent can \"fight\" or \"accommodate\" the entrant. It will fight by lowering its price, running the entrant out of business (and incurring exit costs — a negative payoff) and damaging its own profits. If it accommodates the entrant it will lose some of its sales, but a high price will be maintained and it will receive greater profits than by lowering its price (but lower than monopoly profits).\n\nConsider if the best response of the incumbent is to accommodate if the entrant enters. If the incumbent accommodates, the best response of the entrant is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the entrant enters and the incumbent accommodates if the entrant enters is a Nash equilibrium consistent with backward induction. However, if the incumbent is going to fight, the best response of the entrant is to not enter, and if the entrant does not enter, it does not matter what the incumbent chooses to do in the hypothetical case that the entrant does enter. Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the entrant enters, but the entrant does not enter is also a Nash equilibrium. However, were the entrant to deviate and enter, the incumbent's best response is to accommodate—the threat of fighting is not credible. This second Nash equilibrium can therefore be eliminated by backward induction.\n\nFinding a Nash equilibrium in each decision-making process (subgame) constitutes as perfect subgame equilibria. Thus, these strategy profiles that depict subgame perfect equilibria exclude the possibility of actions like incredible threats that are used to \"scare off\" an entrant. If the incumbent threatens to start a price war Price war with an entrant, they are threatening to lower their prices from a monopoly price to slightly lower than the entrant's, which would be impractical, and incredible, if the entrant knew a price war would not actually happen since it would result in losses for both parties. Unlike a single agent optimization which includes equilibria that aren't feasible or optimal, a subgame perfect equilibrium accounts for the actions of another player, thus ensuring that no player reaches a subgame mistakenly. In this case, backwards induction yielding perfect subgame equilibria ensures that the entrant will not be convinced of the incumbent's threat knowing that it was not a best response in the strategy profile.\n\nThe unexpected hanging paradox is a paradox related to backward induction. Suppose a prisoner is told that she will be hanged sometime between Monday and Friday of next week. However, the exact day will be a surprise (i.e. she will not know the night before that she will be executed the next day). The prisoner, interested in outsmarting her executioner, attempts to determine which day the execution will occur.\n\nShe reasons that it cannot occur on Friday, since if it had not occurred by the end of Thursday, she would know the execution would be on Friday. Therefore, she can eliminate Friday as a possibility. With Friday eliminated, she decides that it cannot occur on Thursday, since if it had not occurred on Wednesday, she would know that it had to be on Thursday. Therefore, she can eliminate Thursday. This reasoning proceeds until she has eliminated all possibilities. She concludes that she will not be hanged next week.\n\nTo her surprise, she is hanged on Wednesday. She made the mistake of assuming that she knew definitively whether the unknown future factor that would cause her execution was one that she could reason about.\n\nHere the prisoner reasons by backward induction, but seems to come to a false conclusion. Note, however, that the description of the problem assumes it is possible to surprise someone who is performing backward induction. The mathematical theory of backward induction does not make this assumption, so the paradox does not call into question the results of this theory. Nonetheless, this paradox has received some substantial discussion by philosophers.\n\nBackward induction works only if both players are rational, i.e., always select an action that maximizes their payoff. However, rationality is not enough: each player should also believe that all other players are rational. Even this is not enough: each player should believe that all other players know that all other players are rational. And so on ad infinitum. In other words, rationality should be common knowledge.\n"}

Another species, \"Lycopus americanus\" has also been erroneously called \"L. europaeus\".\nGypsywort is a rather straggly perennial plant with slender underground runners and grows to a height of about . The stalkless or short-stalked leaves are in opposite pairs. The leaf blades are hairy, narrowly lanceolate-ovate, sometimes pinnately-lobed, and with large teeth on the margin. The inflorescence forms a terminal spike and is composed of dense whorls of white or pale pink flowers. The calyx has five lobes and the corolla forms a two-lipped flower about long with a fused tube. The upper lip of each flower is slightly convex with a notched tip and the lower lip is three-lobed, the central lobe being the largest and bearing a red \"nectar mark\" to attract pollinating insects. There are two stamens, the gynoecium has two fused carpels and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome.\n\nGypsywort grows primarily in wetland areas. It grows along the borders of lakes, ponds and streams as well as in canals and marshes. Its carpels float which may aid dispersal of the plant and its rhizomeous roots also allow the plant to spread. It is in flower from June to September, and produces seeds from August to October.\n\nIt is reputed to have medicinal qualities and has been used by various peoples as an astringent, cosmetic, douche, narcotic and refrigerant. Several research studies have been undertaken on the properties of this plant.\n\nRembert Dodoens wrote of the names of the plant in the 1578 English translation of his original book published in 1563, as the fourth among the group of horehounds “…: in Brabant water Andoren, and of some Egyptenaers cruyt, that is to say, the Egyptians herbe, bycause of the Rogues and runnegates which call themselves Egyptians, do colour themselves blacke with this herbe.” The Brabant original seems to suggest it was used by tramps/hobos who were pretending to be Romany people by darkening their skin. He also wrote that water horehound was not used in medicine. Through time it often came to be said that name gypsywort comes from the belief that Romani people would stain their skin with the juice of the plant, although Howard (1987) states that they used it to dye their linen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2060915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060915", "title": "Manmade God", "text": "Manmade God\n\nManmade God were an American hard rock band from Oakland. They gained prominence in 2003, touring with various mainstream acts and releasing one self-titled album in late summer. They disbanded the following year, however, with the departure of their vocalist and an apparent split with their record label, which was American Recordings.\n\nFormed upon the hiatus of Forbidden in 2001, Manmade God featured both its guitarist Craig Locicero and drummer Steve Jacobs. The new project was joined by bassist James Walker and filled out when Locicero came across a newspaper ad by Pann, a singer on the verge of ending his attempts at music success. The guitarist reflected, \"Before Pann joined, we were more of a finger painting experiment; it never felt like a band. Pann just made all the difference, having direction and emotion.\"\n\nWithin two weeks of formation, Manmade God debuted at the Boomerang Club and played elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay area. They soon met Stone Temple Pilots drummer Eric Kretz who was impressed enough to produce their 3-song demo. While playing, the group soon realized they were not ready to showcase for major labels yet and continued recording. Their material caught the attention of Brian Joseph Dobbs who helped record their next demo at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California.\n\nAccording to Locicero, \"Every management company wanted us; major labels were knocking themselves over to get to us.\" The demos with Dobbs gained response from American Recordings and prompted a private showcase with label head Rick Rubin. Manmade God signed into American in October 2002 and soon began working on their self-titled debut with Dobbs as producer and Rubin as executive producer.\n\nThe band toured heavily the following year, playing alongside doubleDrive in spring. Throughout the summer, Manmade God toured across the US with established acts such as Adema, Powerman 5000, Ra, Spineshank, Taproot, and Type O Negative.\n\nInitially set for a July 29 release, \"Manmade God\" finally hit shelves on August 26, 2003. \nLocicero alleged years later that the delay was because the head of both Columbia and Island Records had \"turned out\" during the recording of \"Manmade God\".\n\nThe album gained both positive and mixed reception; Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic offered a 3/5 rating and proclaimed, \"Throughout their eponymous album, they hammer and thrash with a ponderous intensity. This has been familiar territory since Led Zeppelin trashed its first private jet.\" IGN's Dave Doray gave a meager 5/10 rating, noting how it \"just doesn't introduce us to anything new\" while comparing the vocals to Chris Cornell and bass to Tim Commerford. However, positive response was given to the musical interplay on various tracks. Melodic.net and MetalSucks.net offered stronger support with the latter calling it \"tremendous\" and describing Pann's vocal performance as \"a soulful, gritty version of Filter’s Richard Patrick.\"\n\n\"Manmade God\" was compared stylistically to classic groups like The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath. It was frequently said to have drawn heavily from the more contemporary grunge outfits Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots. The album boasted one single, \"Safe Passage,\" which reached No. 36 on the \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nIn December, the band headlined KSJO's \"Homegrown\" concert at The Edge in Palo Alto. Eric Kretz stood in for an allegedly injured Steve Jacobs for half of the show where Pann expressed to the crowd his disenchantment with the band's lack of exposure, spouting, \"You guys are the first to know who we are, 'cause no one knows who we are.\" In addition to performing nearly every track from their debut album, Manmade God also played a new song entitled \"Awakening\" which Pann wryly noted would be on the band's next record if they make it that far.\n\nManmade God toured into the following year but continued experiencing turbulence with their label. While performing with SOiL in March, the band's touring support was pulled, further frustrating its members.\n\nHaving their touring support removed proved to be the last straw when, a week later, Reed left Manmade God. In a 2011 interview, Locicero reflected that, despite its promising future, Manmade God was \"a victim of bad timing\" because of label issues causing their album's delay.\n\nLocicero added that while his decision may not have been the right one at the time, it allowed him to work on other projects in the future that Manmade God would have prevented.\n\nIn April 2004, shortly after the demise of Manmade God, fellow California group Systematic also disbanded. It was reported soon after that Systematic frontman Tim Narducci was forming an as yet unnamed group with the former guitarist, drummer, and bassist of Manmade God. Narducci had in fact been friends with Locicero since the age of 15 and the two bonded through a common passion for heavy metal. The new group officially named itself Spiralarms and played their first concert together at The Pound in San Francisco on June 5. Referring to himself as Manmade God's new frontman, Narducci explained, \"We changed our name due a number of reasons, mostly political, but most importantly the sound. . . It's much different then what those guys [Manmade God] were doing before and much different even for myself.\" He also enthusiastically reported to have written sixteen complete songs with his new band. In 2010, Spiralarms released their debut album, Highest Society, and intend to release their second album, Freedom, in Feb-March 2013.\n\nIn early 2005, Jacobs suffered a shoulder injury that necessitated his removal from the group. This allowed the introduction of former Stone Temple Pilots drummer Eric Kretz who helped Spiralarms record their debut album. By 2007, Locicero would be the only ex-Manmade God member to remain in Spiralarms and would also be back with the reunited Forbidden. Spiralarms would now include drummer Chris Kontos (ex-Machine Head and Testament), bassist Chris Lombardom, and keyboardist Brad Barth.\n\nOn July 21, 2012 the reformation of the original line up played a reunion show at \"The New Parish\" club in Oakland CA. \nThe band planned on writing and recording all new material, as well as playing local, national, and international shows.\n\nIn July 2014, Reed and Walker created a new band by the name of Orion. Orion's line-up also includes Andy Weller (lead/rhythm guitar) and Jeff Gomes (drums). While Reed only sang for Manmade God, in Orion he sings and plays guitar (both rhythm and lead). Their independently produced debut album, \"Live the Song\", consists of seven new songs. According to Walker, an additional ten songs were written and there were plans for a second album. Sources close to Reed and Walker said they were very excited about the new project, and that they were more involved in this band than they were in Manmade God. Orion began touring for the album in August 2015. Within a year, the group disbanded.\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Featherless Arrow\", he ranks 16th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Zhang Qing as a handsome, energetic and agile warrior with waist like that of a wolf, arms like those of an ape, and a body like that of a tiger. Originally from Zhangde Prefecture (彰德府; present-day Anyang, Henan), he serves as the garrison commander of Dongchang Prefecture (東昌府; present-day Liaocheng, Shandong). He is nicknamed \"Featherlss Arrow\" as he can fling stones with deadly accuracy.\n\nWhen a force from Liangshan Marsh under Lu Junyi comes to demand grains and fodder from Dongchang, Zhang Qing rides out to fight them. He awes the outlaws when he injures Hao Siwen with a stone. Song Jiang comes to reinforce Lu Junyi. As Zhang Qing fights on horseback one after another some of Liangshan's top warriors, he again demonstrates his deadly stone-hurling skill. He injures or shocks Xu Ning, Yan Shun, Han Tao, Peng Qi, Xuan Zan, Huyan Zhuo, Yang Zhi, Zhu Tong, Lei Heng and Suo Chao with his stones. He even captures Liu Tang who fights on foot. Although Guan Sheng and Dong Ping dodge his stones, they dare not come close to him.\n\nWu Yong, Liangshan's chief strategist, proposes luring Zhang Qing into an ambush. When informed that a convoy of rations is approaching Song Jiang's camp, Zhang leaves the city to intercept it. Lu Zhishen, who is leading the convoy, is knocked over by Zhang's stone. Wu Song drags Lu to safety. Thinking he could succeed a second time, Zhang Qing moves to attack Liangshan's rations-loaded boats moored at a riverbank. But Gongsun Sheng engulfs him in darkness with his magic. Losing his way, Zhang Qing falls into the river and is captured.\n\nSong Jiang's sincerity convinces Zhang Qing to surrender. Zhang Qing then tricks Dongchang's prefect to open the city's gates, causing its fall. Zhang Qing also recommends Huangfu Duan, a veterinary physician, be recruited into Liangshan.\n\nZhang Qing is appointed one of the Eight Tiger Cub Vanguard Generals of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the grand Assembly. Following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan, Zhang Qing participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebels on Song territory.\n\nZhang Qing scores top merit when he captures Tian Hu, the leader of a rebel force, with the help of Qiong Ying, the foster daughter of one of Tian's followers. Zhang marries Qiong, who bears him a son named Zhang Jie (). Qiong Ying is also an excellent stone thrower.\n\nIn the battle of Dusong Pass (獨松關; located south of present-day Anji County, Zhejiang) in the campaign against Fang La, Zhang Qing and Dong Ping are assigned to take down the place. There they battle with Li Tianrun, one of Fang's top warriors. Although injured in an arm by a projectile, Dong Ping continues to fight Li on horseback. When he retreats to treat his wound, Zhang Qing takes over the fight. He misses a stab with his spear on Li and gets it stuck in a tree. As he struggles to pull it out, Li Tianrun stabs him in the abdomen and kills him. When the campaign ends, Zhang Qing's remains are sent back to Zhangde for burial.\n\n"}

This ward stretches south west to Patching with a total ward population as at the 2011 census of 2,557.\n\nThe parish is on the slopes of and between two hills: Cissbury with its Iron Age hill fort to the east and a steep knoll Church Hill to the west. A further escarpment to the West and North stretches along the borders of the area. On the two named hills are remains of prehistoric flint mines where shafts were sunk about to reach the best seams of flint which were mined from radiating galleries. The village is now bypassed by the A24 as it crosses the South Downs: the bypass was constructed in 1938. A modern settlement to the south of the village, inside the boundary of the Borough of Worthing is called Findon Valley. The parish is settled as a nucleated village at between 39 and 84m above sea level (Ordnance Datum) and the South Downs rise to 170 and 181 metres to west and east respectively.\n\nContiguously to the south-east is the sole sub-locality, Nepcote which faces Nepcote Green, the public parkland venue for the annual Findon sheep fair held in early September. Originally a charter fair dating from as early as 1261 many thousands of sheep were penned on the green for sale in earlier times. Wooden hurdles for pens were stored in the purpose built Wattle House on the green which also included living accommodation. Nowadays the fair is a sheep show and funfair.\n\nThe parish church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, stands to the west of the village and the A24 road near the 18th century mansion Findon Place. The church is built of flint to an unusual design, the nave and north aisle having been given a single span roof with king-posts resting on the arcade, probably in the 15th century. The screen is a rare 13th century example, but heavily restored. There are four public houses, the \"Gun Inn\", the \"Black Horse\", the \"Village House\", the \"Snooty Fox\" (part of the Findon Manor Hotel) all of which are located in High Street. The village has a small primary school, situated on School Hill, called Saint John the Baptist. It boasts many annual events, including a fireworks display and May Day celebrations.\n\nThe Monarch's Way long-distance footpath crosses the village which is the only significant settlement on the route between Arundel and Bramber.\n\n"}

The characters were adapted for animation by series creator Brynne Stephens, who also story edited the show. \"Starcom\" was produced by DIC Animation City and distributed by Coca-Cola Telecommunications. The plot detailed the adventures of an American astronaut brigade as they fought off attempted invasions by Shadow Force, a nasty collection of humans and robots led by the nefarious Emperor Dark. The toy line was popular in Europe and Asia, but was unsuccessful in the North American domestic market.\n\nThe show was developed with the help of the Young Astronauts’ Council, with the original intention of sparking young viewers’ interest in the NASA Space Program. \n\nThe show earned poor ratings, and it was cancelled after 13 episodes. The series was broadcast in reruns in the early 1990s, but no new episodes were produced.\n\nLike many 1980s toys, the development of the Starcom toy line preceded the development of the cartoon series.\n\n\"Starcom: The U.S. Space Force\" debuted on television screens in 1987, and the toy line hit stores around the same time. There was plenty of variety for the pint-sized empire builder to choose from: the complete series of Starcom toys offered 23 figures, 6 playsets, and 13 vehicles on the Starcom side, while the Shadow Force was represented by 15 action figures and 11 vehicles. The action figures were two inches tall and came packaged with a backpack, a weapon, and identification cards that explained who they were and what their equipment could do. Like the figures, the vehicles and playsets benefited from a sleek, attractive design.\n\nThe most unusual aspect of the Starcom toy line was its use of Magna Lock technology. The action figures had tiny magnets implanted in their feet. Not only did this allow them to stand on the vehicles and playsets without falling off, but it also activated devices in the playsets. For instance, if one placed a figure in the elevator of the Starbase Station playset, its Magna Lock magnets would cause the elevator to rise to the top by itself. On the same playset, if one put a figure within a cannon, the Magna Lock magnets would activate a mechanism that made it turn and fire its rockets.\n\nThe vehicles and playsets also delivered Power Deploy features, which uses automatic wind up mechanisms that allows them to perform multiple actions all in a touch of a button, without the use of batteries. For example, with the touch of a button, the Starcom StarWolf unfolds its front, and both its wings. All in all, they offered plenty of moving parts (hidden compartments, cannons, folding wings, etc.). Starcom toys never caught on in the U.S. due to poor promotion and the fact that its parent show only lasted a year in syndication. They were discontinued after two years but ended up doing very well in Europe, where both the show and the toys continued to be popular long after the American toys. The toys were successful and hugely popular in Europe and Southeast Asia only after coming under the production and promotion of Mattel. That company removed the US flag and NASA details from the Coleco originals and launched the toys with a second line of promotions in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Sterling Entertainment released \"Starcom: The Search for Aliens\" on DVD containing 3 episodes.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released \"Starcom: The U.S. Space Force- The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.\n\nDefenders in \"StarCom\" are divided into three categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Shadow Force\" is divided into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n"}

She deliberately explores ambiguity, and in her approach to the painted surface she works in glazed layers as well as destructive techniques to create images evoking a particular atemporal context. Although so very different in subject, the works have the same aura of loneliness, stillness and desire.\n\nHer influences range from sculpture and painting to architecture, photography and film, and include Roman death masks, 19th century daguerreotype photography, documentary films, stills from damaged motion pictures, Eugène Atget, Margaret Bourke-White, Rembrandt, Turner and Francis Bacon.\n\nEdward Lucie-Smith wrote the following about Kulenovic's work: \"No-one could describe Maya Kulenovic's paintings as 'photographic', but their place in the realist tradition is nevertheless secure. Her work is realist in the way that Rembrandt and Goya are realist. They attempt to explore the essence of human existence, and often come up with uncomfortable truths. These truths are conveyed through paintings that fall into very specific categories, related to the old hierarchy of genres that was discarded by the pioneering Modernists, in Kulenovic's work we find still life paintings, portraits (of a sort), landscapes and architectural compositions\"\nThe still lifes, the architectural compositions, the faces and the landscapes are all, in their essence, attempts to identify and present a particular state of being. This quality is, as Edward Lucie-Smith states, 'the thing that makes her work so haunting, and so unlike the work of any other artist of her own generation that I can immediately think of'.\n\n\n\n"}

The Falcon 8X is derived from the 7X with a longer range of afforded by engine optimizing, aerodynamic refinements and an increase in fuel capacity. Featuring an S-duct central engine, it and the Falcon 900 are the only two trijets in production.\n\nDassault launched the FNX at the 2001 Paris Air Show, aiming for a 10,500km (5,700nm) range at Mach 0.88 up from the Falcon 900EX 8,300 km at Mach 0.84. Its new high-speed wing is longer with 5° higher wing sweep than the 900 wing, while its fuselage is 20% longer, it keeps the same cabin cross-section but with a new curved windscreen. The trijet has a combined thrust of 18,000lb (80kN) provided by Honeywell FX5s, a new design, or a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 growth version. Based on Honeywell Primus Epic avionics, its EASy cockpit is developed for the Falcon 2000EX and 900EX and controls are fly-by-wire. Scheduled to fly in 2004, first deliveries were planned for mid-2006.\n\nWith 41 deposits, it was named 7X in November with first flight slipping from late 2004 to early 2005 and certification planned for mid-2006. With a simplified structure to reduce cost and weight, the optimised high-transonic wing improves by more than 10% the lift-to-drag ratio over the supercritical-section wing of the Falcon 50 shared by previous Falcons. The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, air management system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the hydromechanical flap and airbrake systems.\n\nWith over 50 firm orders, it completed its first flight on 5 May in 1h 36min from Bordeaux-Merignac, starting a 1,200h flight test programme over 15 month: it climbed to 10,000 ft (3,000 m) for hydraulic, fuel, air data and landing gear extraction/retraction systems tests, then climbed to 25,000 ft for acceleration/deceleration tests and basic autopilot and autothrottle operations. The second Falcon 7X should join in June, and the third with a full interior in September for long-range, endurance tests and interior sound level validation: Dassault aims for a 52dB sound level in the cabin, 4dB lower than other Falcons. Certification slipped to late 2006 and first deliveries to early 2007.\n\nIt was first presented to the public at the 2005 Paris Air Show. The aircraft has received its type certification from both the Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 27 April 2007. The first 7X, MSN05, entered service on 15 June 2007. The hundredth was delivered in November 2010. It conducted high altitude airport tests at in Daocheng in 2014.\n\nIn 2001, the Falcon 7X, at approximately $35 million (preproduction order price), was nearly $10 million cheaper than its nearest competitors in the long-range, large cabin market segment, including the Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier Global Express. It was targeted to be priced for 2004 at 12% more than the $33 million top-of-the-range Falcon 900EX equipped: $39.6 million. Its price was $37 million in 2005, and $41 million in 2007.\nIn 2017, its list price was $54M, a 3-4-year-old 7X was worth $27-34m and a 7-9 year old one cost $19-24M. The latest market data for Q1 2020 shows 287 out of 289 aircraft currently in operation with an asking price range of $18,495,000 - $24,800,000.\n\nThe Falcon 7X is a three-engined cantilever monoplane with a low-positioned, highly swept wing. It has a horizontal stabiliser at mid-height and a retractable tricycle landing gear, and three rear-mounted Pratt & Whitney PW307A turbofan engines : two on the side of the fuselage and one in a center position, and room for 20 passengers and two crew. It is the first production Falcon jet with winglets.\n\nIt is the first fully fly-by-wire business jet and is equipped with the same avionics suite, the Honeywell Primus Epic \"Enhanced Avionics System\" (EASy), that was used on the Falcon 900EX and later on the Falcon 2000EX.\n\nThe Falcon 7X is notable for its extensive use of computer-aided design, the manufacturer claiming it to be the \"first aircraft to be designed entirely on a virtual platform\", using Dassault Systemes' CATIA and PLM products.\nIn February 2010, Dassault Falcon and BMW Designworks were awarded the 2009 Good Design Award by the Chicago Athenaeum and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design for their collaboration on the new Falcon 7X interior option.\nDue to special engine mounts and cabin isolators, the cabin is extremely quiet, below 50 dBA, and is available with a shower.\n\nEASA grounded the Falcon 7X fleet after a report from Dassault Aviation regarding an uncontrolled pitch trim runaway during descent in one of its jets in May 2011. The aircraft pitched up to 41 degrees, with the load factor increasing to 4.6\"g\", it climbed from 13,000 to 22,500 ft and the airspeed went from 300 to 125 kn.\n\n\"This condition, if occurring again, could lead to loss of control of the aeroplane,\" the EASA notice said. Initial results of investigation showed that there was a production defect in the Horizontal Stabilizer Electronic Control Unit which could have contributed to the cause of the event. Dassault Aviation developed modifications in June 2011 to allow a return to flight.\n\nAfter four years of investigation, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile published its final report in June 2016. It was found that incorrect nose-up commands to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer were caused by a soldering defect on the pin of its electronic control unit provided by Rockwell Collins.\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Dassault Falcon pilots Philippe Deleume and Olivier Froment set a new speed record for the Falcon 7X on a 5 h 54 min flight from New York Teterboro Airport to London City Airport with three passengers on board.\n\nThe 6,450 nmi (11,945 km) range Falcon 8X was announced at the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in May 2014. Its cabin is longer than the 7X. With improvements to wing design and improved Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300, the 8X is up to 35% more fuel efficient than its competitors.\n\nThe prototype, registered F-WWQA, first flew from Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport on 6 February 2015.

{"id": "2061013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061013", "title": "Mat Rogers", "text": "Mat Rogers\n\nMathew Steve Rogers (born 1 February 1976) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. He also played rugby union at the highest level, becoming a dual-code international. The son of the late Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks legend and CEO Steve Rogers, Mat played for the Sharks as well. He played in two State of Origin series for Queensland (1999 and 2000), and 7 Tests for the Australian national side (1998 to 2000) before his switch to union in 2001. Rogers played at fly half in his final season for the Waratahs and started in a number of games for the Wallabies in various positions in the backline. He returned to rugby league in 2007 with the newly formed Gold Coast Titans club and retired in 2010. With the Titans beset by injuries and poor form, Rogers announced his comeback to help out the club on-field in 2011, but a serious injury forced him to announce his retirement again just minutes into his first game back. Rogers is also well known for another career path on the Network Ten revival of \"Australian Survivor\" competing in both the third and fifth seasons. Despite not winning he has since become a massive fan favourite amongst the \"Survivor\" fan base being dubbed \"The Godfather\". \n\nRogers was born in Caringbah, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nHe began playing junior rugby league for the Engadine Dragons.\n\nHis father, Steve, retired from professional rugby league in 1986 and the family settled on the Gold Coast, Queensland when Mat was 9 years of age. Mat attended The Southport School (TSS) during his high schooling years and played both forms of the game. Rogers excelled in union at TSS, a well known rugby union nursery. He played in the Australian Schoolboys representative team in 1993, at one point playing opposite a young Jonny Wilkinson, and future All Blacks player Jonah Lomu.\n\nAfter deciding that rugby league was his preferred career path, Rogers joined his father's former club, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Rogers formed powerful combinations with partner Andrew Ettingshausen and later fullback David Peachey. he was an entertaining ball-running winger during the mid-to-late 90s. He held several point-scoring records with Cronulla being a talented goal kicker and having an ability to score tries from the tightest situations. Rogers was chosen for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Tri Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played on the wing, scoring two tries and kicking three goals in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory.\n\nRogers expressed his desire to shift from his position on the wing to either Centre or Fullback. However, a serious injury to his shoulder rotator cuff at the conclusion of the Kangaroo's successful 2000 World Cup Campaign destroyed his chance. Despite this he was the tournament's top point-scorer. After a complete shoulder reconstruction he was restricted to a handful of games during the 2001 season, his final year with the Sharks.\n\nFollowing his switch Rogers was an immediate success in rugby union. He made his Wallaby debut with Wendell Sailor in a Test match against France in June 2002. Collectively at that point they became the 41st and 42nd Australian dual code internationals.\n\nHis transition had not been without controversy. Several times Rogers found himself the focus of media scrutiny after making comments regarding the state of Australian club rugby in comparison to training for the Wallabies and after an alleged altercation outside an Edinburgh nightclub with a fan in 2004.\n\nHis initial switch was less than smooth after coach Bob Dwyer revealed that Waratahs and Wallaby stalwart Matthew Burke would be moved from his preferred position of fullback to outside centre in order to accommodate Rogers. His 2004 Super 12 season started brilliantly but a serious ankle injury suffered in South Africa ruled him out of that year's Tri Nations series.\n\nAn autobiography \"Off the Wing, On a Prayer\" was published in 2002 and written while his father Steve Rogers was still alive and when he was married to Michelle Miller, the mother of his children – Jack and Skyla.\n\nStarting in the 2005 Tri Nations Series, Rogers was shifted from fullback to play at fly-half following the injury of Stephen Larkham. He continued to play in that position during the 2005 spring tour of Europe and remained there for the Waratahs for most of the new Super 14 competition in 2006.\n\nComing on late in the second half in the second test against South Africa in the 2006 Tri Nations Series, Rogers scored a late try which allowed Stirling Mortlock to kick the winning conversion from the left sideline, for a 20–18 win.\n\nIt was reported on 28 August 2006 that Rogers had sustained a knee injury requiring arthroscopic surgery and was ruled out of the last test against The Springboks but was fit for the end of year tour. \"I've had (the injury) for a couple of weeks and I was hoping it would have pulled up a bit better than it has,\" Rogers said. \"I'm disappointed to miss out on the Springboks match because I feel that we've got a great chance of winning a Test on their soil, which hasn't been done for a long time.\" \n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2006 sparked the question of how many games Rogers has actually not participated in due to injuries and quoted the following figures:\n\"Rogers has missed 21 out of 61 games for the Waratahs, some due to his father's death at the start of the year. For the Wallabies he has played 41 of 57 matches. Overall, he has not played for 37 of 118 games making him a spectator 31% of the time since moving to rugby union.\"\n\nRogers was named in the 37-man squad for Australia's tour of Europe. He had been selected to play at fly-half with usual number 10 Larkham playing outside him at inside-centre.\n\nOn 14 December 2006, Mat Rogers was released from his contract from the Waratahs and the Australian Rugby Union.\nIn 2007, Rogers revived his rugby league career with the new club, Gold Coast Titans in the National Rugby League. He became their equal top tryscorer for the Titan's inaugural season even after missing a handful of games late in the season due to a cracked patella.\n\nRogers started the 2008 season with the Gold Coast Titans at five-eighth. Rogers had been suspended for the first time in his NRL career after a dangerous tackle on Parramatta Eels winger, Luke Burt, during Round 5 of the NRL Premiership.\n\nRoger announced his retirement from professional sport on 16 August 2010, and played his last NRL game on 24 September, with the Titans losing the preliminary final to the Sydney Roosters. There was speculation that he would continue to play in 2011, with Rogers hinting that he would register with the NRL in case of an injury crisis, but that did not eventuate\n\nWith the Titans playing poorly in 2011, Rogers had \nagreed to train with the club and was intent on returning to the field.\nHe returned in Round 18 against the New Zealand Warriors. However, Rogers broke his foot in the 22-6 loss, effectively ending both his season and his career for a second time. (League News, Gold Coast Titans, Rugby League| Wed 29 June 09:50:50 EST 2011)\n\nIn 2000, Rogers was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.\n\nHe holds the standing record for the most points scored in an Australia-New Zealand rugby league Test match with 24 (2 tries and 8 goals) scored in the Anzac Test of 2000 in Sydney.\n\nIn his five seasons with Waratahs, he became the third highest points scorer with 202 points. He equalled Matthew Burke's record for the most individual conversions in a match with six, achieved in the Waratahs 2004 round two clash against the Sharks at Aussie Stadium on 28 February 2004.\n\nIn the 2003 Rugby World Cup, he set the Australian record the most points in match. It came in Australia's 142–0 victory over Namibia where he scored two tries and 16 conversions for 42 points.\n\nWhilst playing Rugby League with Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Mat had set many records, including:-\nMost career points (all grades) - 1321 points (1994 - 2001)\nMost points in a season - 212 points (including 18 tries and 70 conversion goals - 2000)\nMost points in a match - 26 points (3 tries, 7 conversion goals) versus Newcastle - 2000)\nThe records in the season of 2000 were set when Mat only played 23 of 27 games. Of those 23 games, Mat scored points in every game except Brisbane in Round 17.\n\nRogers married model and media personality Chloe Maxwell on the Gold Coast on 26 October 2008. Rogers has four children, Jack and Skyla from a previous relationship and Maxwell Danger (born 5 June 2006) and daughter Phoenix (born 21 September 2007) with current wife Chloe.\n\nRogers has been committed to raising awareness about depression since the death of his father Steve in January 2006. His father battled depression for three years and, while suicide was initially suspected, his death after taking alcohol and prescription drugs was ruled an accident.\n\nHe has signed on to be an ambassador for Movember, an initiative that encourages men to grow a moustache during November to raise funds for research into depression and prostate cancer. Rogers has said he fears inheriting a propensity for the mental illness. He has made a pact with brother Don always to be honest about their feelings and encouraged men to talk to family, doctors or mates.\n\nHe was a semifinalist in the fifteenth season of \"Dancing with the Stars\".\n\nRogers worked for the Gold Coast commonwealth Games held in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, Rogers appeared as a contestant on \"\", competing in the fifth season of the competitive reality television series \"Australian Survivor\" as part of the Champions tribe. During the early portions of the game, Rogers used his physical strength to help his tribe win challenges and was avoided being targeted. Before a crucial tribe swap, Rogers had a core alliance with fellow Champion tribemates Shane Gould, Lydia Lassila, Steve Willis, Moana Hope, Samuel \"Sam\" Hinton, and Sharn Coombes. Rogers was able to make it to merge only losing one alliance member, Hope, but soon assisted in voting out Lassila and Hinton. On day 37, Rogers had a plan to vote out fellow contestant Brian Lake, but was ultimately blindsided and voted out by tribemates Monika Radulovic and Benji Wilson. Rogers finished in 9th place and became the third member of the jury.\n\nIn 2020, Rogers returned to compete on \"\". He gained praise after forming an underground alliance with David Genat, after being on the bottom of the Vakama tribe. At the tribe swap, he was swapped onto a tribe with none of his former alliance members. Rogers was voted out on Day 22, after playing 2 idols throughout the season. He was the 10th person voted out. \n\n\n"}

The station airs a hot adult contemporary radio format branded as \"KiSS 102.3\". The station is owned by Rogers Media which also owns sister station CITI-FM. CKY-FM's studios are located in Osborne Village south of Downtown Winnipeg, while its transmitter is located at Duff Roblin Provincial Park near Saint Germain.\n\nCKY-FM primarily competes with CFPG-FM.\n\nCKY has been the call sign of three radio stations in Winnipeg. The original CKY was formed in 1923 by the Government of Manitoba and operated by the Manitoba Telephone System. The Provincial Government ran the station and in the station's early years, CKY would turn over its signal to the Canadian National Railway and the station would be identified as CNRW. When the Federal Government took over operations of the CNR Network in the 1930s, CKY continued the relationship and much of CKY's programing originated with the CRBC (which later became the CBC). In June 1948, CKY was purchased by the CBC and was renamed CBW. On the last day of 1949, Lloyd Moffat resurrected the CKY call letters to begin the second incarnation of CKY.\n\nThe current CKY-FM was established in 1949 by Moffat Communications as CKY, broadcasting at AM 580. The station featured a Top 40 format for much of its broadcast life, which shifted into an Oldies format in the 1980s. In 1963, Moffat also established the first CKY-FM, at 92.1 on the FM dial and for a period of time was the most powerful radio station in North America broadcasting at 360,000 watts. In 1978, CKY-FM was re-branded as CITI-FM.\n\nA 1980 article in the Free Press said that both CFRW and CKY wanted to broadcast in AM stereo; CKY chose the failed Kahn-Hazeltine system.\n\nIn 1992, Moffat sold its radio division Rogers Communications. In 1994, Rogers applied to the CRTC to switch CKY to the FM band, due to declining listening to AM stations, which would lead to lower revenues. However, due to the success of CKY's \"Don Percy and Friends\" morning show, which featured numerous \"info chats\" from businesses, the station managed to make a considerable profit. As a result, Rogers held off the conversion to FM until 2004.\n\nOn January 21, 2004, Rogers moved CKY to FM, at 102.3 FM, with an ERP of 70,000 watts. The 580 frequency at first went silent in Winnipeg, although community broadcasters have attempted to revive the station as CJML. The new CKY-FM aired a soft adult contemporary format with the on-air brand name 102.3 Clear FM. This restored the adult contemporary format to Winnipeg after it was lost with the flip of CFWM-FM from adult contemporary to adult hits in 2002.\n\nA new logo for CKY-FM was unveiled late June 2011, and the station moved in a more rhythmic direction (like sister CHFM-FM Calgary), but was still reporting as adult contemporary per Mediabase & Nielsen BDS.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, the station re-branded as \"102.3 KiSS FM\", without any change in personnel. The re-branding aligned CKY with other Kiss-branded hot AC stations operated by Rogers. The station has since moved to a hot adult contemporary sound and has slightly rebranded itself as \"KiSS 102.3\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2061032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061032", "title": "John Rarick", "text": "John Rarick\n\nJohn Richard Rarick (January 29, 1924 – September 14, 2009) was an American lawyer who served as a Louisiana state district court judge from 1961 to 1966 in St. Francisville, Louisiana, the seat of West Feliciana Parish, and as a Democratic U.S. representative from the Sixth Congressional District from 1967 to 1975. A staunch conservative, he frequently quarreled with his party's increasingly liberal philosophy and leadership. In 1980, he sought the presidency as the nominee of the former American Independent Party, founded in 1968 by George C. Wallace of Alabama.\n\nRarick was born in rural Waterford in La Porte County in Indiana. He graduated from Goshen High School in Goshen, Indiana. He studied at Ball State University (then Teacher's College) in Muncie, Indiana.\n\nRarick then entered the United States Army's Specialized Training Program and was sent to Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he lived in the college barracks. He was then dispatched to the European Theater with the infantry during World War II. He was captured at the Battle of the Bulge and later escaped from a German prisoner of war camp at Würzburg. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n\nAfter his military service, Rarick obtained his bachelor's degree from LSU. He then attended Tulane University Law School in New Orleans, from which he graduated with an LLB and then a Juris Doctor degree in 1949. He was admitted to the Louisiana state bar later that year and set up a law practice in St. Francisville north of Baton Rouge. He was a member of the Louisiana State Bar Association for more than sixty years. On June 28, 1961, he was elected as a judge of the 20th Judicial District in East and West Feliciana parishes. He resigned the judgeship on May 15, 1966, to declare his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nRarick had been a member of the Democratic Party in Indiana and for a time was the party's city chairman in Goshen. He remained a Democrat when he moved to Louisiana. In the summer of 1966, Rarick upset veteran Sixth District U.S. Representative James Hobson \"Jimmy\" Morrison (no relation to DeLesseps Story Morrison) of Hammond in a closed Democratic primary runoff with 51.2 percent of the vote. Morrison had a \"moderate racial record\" and was attacked in the campaign by Rarick as an ally of \"the black-power voting bloc\" and being an \"LBJ rubber stamp\". Rarick campaigned on \"a segregationist, anti-President Johnson and anti-federal government theme.\" Morrison accused Rarick of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan, for which Rarick sued Morrison for libel.\n\nRarick quickly compiled a very conservative voting record, even by Louisiana Democratic standards. According to one scoring method, published in the \"American Journal of Political Science\", Rarick was the second most conservative Democrat of either chamber of Congress between 1937 and 2002. In a period of four years, 1971–1974, the American Conservative Union gave Rarick a perfect score of 100 three times, and a score of 91 once (in 1973). Like colleague Joe D. Waggonner Jr., of Bossier Parish, Rarick was a former member of the pro-segregation White Citizens' Council, founded in the middle 1950s by the State Senator William M. Rainach of Claiborne Parish. Rarick spoke at events sponsored by the anticommunist John Birch Society.\n\nIn November 1967, with less than a year of congressional service to his credit, Rarick challenged popular Democratic Governor John J. McKeithen for renomination. Rarick secured the support of various \"far right\" groups in the state, but was badly defeated, winning only 17.3 percent of the two-candidate vote to McKeithen's 80.7 percent. (There were several minor candidates not included in the percent breakdown.) Rarick did not poll a gubernatorial majority even among those voters who expected to support Wallace for president in 1968.\n\nDuring the primary campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor, three or four men in a car fired four quick shots at the congressman in a New Orleans parking lot. Rarick told the media: \"The whole thing happened about like the flip of a finger. At first it sounded like someone threw a cherry bomb. Then I turned around and looked at this car. This fellow was pointing a gun right at me. The shots kept coming. I jumped between cars ... I couldn't even tell you how many shots were fired. You don't count when you're looking down a gun barrel.\"\n\nIn both his campaign against Jimmy Morrison and against John McKeithen, Rarick was regarded as the segregationist candidate. As a judge, Rarick had condemned racial integration as \"a tool of the Communist conspiracy.\" He referred to racial busing as a torture tactic.\n\nOn June 13, 1967, Rarick introduced H.R. 208 which asked Congress to renounce the validity of the 14th Amendment; Rarick presented historical evidence gathered by Leander H. Perez of Plaquemines Parish purporting to show that the 14th Amendment was never validly adopted.\n\nIn the midst of riots in Washington, D.C., following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rarick called for a congressional investigation into the violence in the capital, and remarked that the police and federal troops in the city had been \"rendered ineffective\" by orders which \"utilized the forces of law and order to protect the looters and rioters from an angry citizenry.\" A year after King's death, Rarick called King \"a Communist errand-boy\" and a man \"whose only claim to fame was disobedience of the law.\"\n\nIn 1969, Rarick was described as a \"patsy\" for neo-Nazis for having spoken at several Liberty Lobby rallies; similar charges were made against several other politicians of national standing. It was also alleged that Willis Carto's United Congressional Appeal made $3,000 contributions to Rarick and two other U.S. representatives.\n\nIn 1970, Rarick gave a speech in support of Ian Smith's white minority-rule government in the former Rhodesia and denounced the U.S. policy of denying recognition to Smith's government.\n\nIn February 1971, when Captain Jerry B. Finley of Louisiana faced dismissal for refusing to shake hands with a black officer, Rarick called a news conference in Finley's defense. The Associated Press reported that \"John Rarick ... said that in his state it is not considered in good taste for a white person to shake hands with a black stranger.\"\n\nIn 1972, U.S. Representative Charles C. Diggs, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called Rarick the \"leading racist in this (92nd) Congress.\" The remark was made during a hearing on home rule for the District of Columbia, which Rarick testified against—at one point, he described the district as a \"sinkhole, rat infested ... the laughing stock of the free and Communist world.\" Diggs said that \"We are stretching the First Amendment even to permit you to speak before this committee.\" The local D.C. audience applauded Diggs' remarks, a fact which Rarick felt was \"a perfect example of why we should prohibit home rule for the District of Columbia.\"\n\nOn January 3, 1973, Rarick introduced a resolution asking for a concurrent resolution by Congress stating that the federal government, the states, and local governments could not bar the song \"Dixie\" from being played. The same day, he asked for a resolution that federal employees living in the District of Columbia must send their children to the predominantly black D.C. public schools.\n\nIn 1968, Rarick won renomination by turning back a primary challenge from State Senator J. D. DeBlieux of Baton Rouge. DeBlieux (pronounced like the letter \"W\") was one of the first white politicians in Louisiana to have endorsed the civil rights agenda. By a 79-21 percent margin, Rarick then defeated the Republican congressional nominee, Loyd J. Rockhold\n\nIn 1968, Rarick supported American Independent Party candidate George Wallace for president against Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey and Republican Richard M. Nixon. Like the Democratic Representatives Albert W. Watson and John Bell Williams who had supported Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, Rarick was also stripped of seniority by the House Democratic Caucus for having openly supported Wallace.\n\nSome Democrats were hesitant to discipline Rarick for concern that punitive action might make him a martyr in his district. Representative Richard W. Bolling of Missouri of the House Rules Committee, however, led the move to strip Rarick of his two years of seniority. Rarick depicted himself as one with \"political leprosy ... a whipping boy to intimidate older party members, to frighten them ... so they will vote as a unity group.\" Since Rarick had only served a single term, the action was largely a symbolic gesture. Nonetheless, Rarick reportedly considered switching to the Republican Party but never did so. George Wallace carried the Sixth District that Rarick represented by 54 percent, and won Louisiana by a plurality vote of 48 percent statewide.\n\nIn 1969, Rarick wrote a letter of support to New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Mario Procaccino, offering to campaign \"either for or against you [Procaccino]—whichever will be more helpful.\" Procaccino was thereafter defeated by the incumbent liberal Republican John V. Lindsay, who in 1971 defected to the Democrats and unsuccessfully sought his new party's presidential nomination in 1972.\n\nIn 1970, Rarick won renomination, 57,835 to 40,450, against the liberal Democrat Jesse Bankston of Baton Rouge, a long-time figure in the Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee.\n\nIn 1972, as Rarick was re-elected to his fourth and final term, his home parish of West Feliciana was the only parish among the sixty-four parishes to support Democratic presidential nominee George S. McGovern for president over Richard Nixon.\n\nOnce described as \"a Communist-hater of mountainous rage,\" Rarick favored prosecution of the Vietnam War. He spoke at pro-war rallies with fellow anti-communist Carl McIntire. He remarked at an April 1970 rally that \"A people with the intelligence, the skills, the financial resources and the organizational ability to place astronauts on the moon—not once, but repeatedly—is surely capable of military victory over a minor, backward, disorganized, fourth-rate dictatorship.\" At a May 1971 rally, he remarked that U.S. leaders \"lack the guts to end the war in the five to six weeks every military leader says it will take.\" Rarick also joined McIntire at a rally urging Nixon to cancel his upcoming trip to China.\n\nRarick testified in favor of strengthening the Internal Security Act of 1950 and charged that the Subversive Activities Control Board was not doing its job.\n\nRarick, along with Republican Representative John M. Ashbrook of Ohio, regularly inserted accounts of terror tactics in the former South Vietnam into the \"Congressional Record\".\n\nIn April 1971, mere days after Lieutenant William Calley was convicted of ordering the My Lai Massacre, Rarick offered an amendment, dedicated to Calley, which would have outlawed the prosecution of soldiers for killings during wartime. \"We must tell every mother we shall not let another soldier be disgraced in this manner,\" Rarick said in advocacy of the amendment, \"Isn't premeditated murder what war is all about?\" The amendment was defeated by a voice vote.\n\nIn September 1971, 21 Senators and 33 House members, led by James L. Buckley (New York Conservative) and William E. Brock III (Tennessee Republican), called a press conference to urge that the Republic of China (Taiwan) not be expelled from the United Nations; some congressmen, however, expressed support for President Nixon's efforts to improve relationships with the People's Republic of China. The conference came to an abrupt end when Representative John G. Schmitz (California Republican) and Rarick stood up and walked out, with Schmitz saying, \"Congressman Rarick and I are leaving, and you can take our names off that list. This is too weak a position.\"\n\nEarly in 1972, Rarick opposed President Nixon's latest peace proposal that would allow, when implemented in 1973, the acceptance of the Communist Party in a new government in South Vietnam. Rarick referred to Nixon as a \"sellout\" and one who catered to his own Democratic opponents. Colleague F. Edward Hébert, a Democrat from New Orleans, also known for his hawkish views on the war, however, defended Nixon's offer as sincere and workable.\n\nIn 1971, Rarick joined liberal Democratic U.S. Representatives Robert L. Leggett of California and Parren J. Mitchell of Maryland to sponsor the \"People Power Over War Act\", a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a national referendum on military action other than an invasion of the country. It was patterned after the former Ludlow Amendment. From 1935 to 1941, Representative Louis L. Ludlow, an Indiana Democrat, introduced legislation each year to oppose President Franklin D. Roosevelt's interventionist foreign policy. The text of the measure reads in part: \"Except in the event of an attack or invasion the authority of Congress to declare war shall not become effective until confirmed by a majority of all votes cast thereon in a nationwide referendum.\"\n\nEarly in 1972, U.S. Senator Sam Ervin, of North Carolina disclosed that Army intelligence surveillance of civilian officials from late 1967 into 1970 was more extensive than had been previously revealed. In a brief filed with the United States Supreme Court, Ervin said that the Army had watched the political activities of certain public officials and retired politicians, including Rarick. Ervin said that the main targets were persons and organizations either opposed to the Vietnam War or considered \"anti-establishment\".\n\nAmong the measures that Rarick introduced in Congress were the following:\n\n\nRarick was an opponent of gun control and gun registration. Of the latter, he said in 1971, \"History confirms that registration of firearms inevitably leads to confiscation, followed by enslavement of peoples.\" Also that year, he introduced a bill to repeal the Gun Control Act of 1968, signed into law by President Johnson.\n\nRarick supported prayer in public schools, backing a constitutional amendment to that end.\n\nIn 1973, Rarick introduced a bill to withdraw the U.S. from the United Nations. Earlier, in 1972, Rarick tried to bring John G. Schmitz's bill to withdraw from the U.N. to a vote. Rarick was against foreign aid, writing in 1971: \"In my three terms in the House I have never seen a foreign aid bill that deserved passage. I have always felt that we should have Americans helping Americans first, not after they got through helping everyone else.\"\n\nRepresentative H. R. Gross (Iowa Republican) and Rarick were vocal opponents of legislation converting the U.S. to the metric system, Rarick calling it \"anti-American\".\n\nIn 1974, voters denied Rarick renomination, as they had done to Morrison eight years earlier. In order to unseat Rarick the Democratic Party leadership either paid for or strongly encouraged nine candidates to oppose Rarick in the primary race so that Rarick could be prevented from receiving a plurality. Rarick was unseated in the Democrat runoff election by a young Baton Rouge television broadcaster formerly from Arkansas, Jeffrey Dean \"Jeff\" LaCaze (born c. 1944), who objected to Rarick's conservative voting record. LaCaze prevailed, 60,570 votes to 56,659. LaCaze was considered a liberal who enjoyed the support of organized labor and most African Americans in a district then almost one-third black.\n\nLaCaze in turn lost to Republican W. Henson Moore III, of Baton Rouge in a disputed November 1974 general election. In a special election rematch held in January 1975 to resolve the deadlock, LaCaze lost by nearly eight percentage points to Moore. LaCaze was then made public relations spokesman for then mayor of Baton Rouge, W. W. \"Woody\" Dumas. The Sixth District seat was then in Republican hands for more than thirty years, first with Moore, then with Richard H. Baker, also of Baton Rouge, until state Representative Don Cazayoux of New Roads defeated Republican former state Representative Louis Elwood \"Woody\" Jenkins Jr. in a special election held on May 3, 2008. The seat returned to Republican hands in January 2009 after Cazayoux lost the regular general election on November 4, 2008, to Bill Cassidy, a Baton Rouge physician.\n\nRarick resumed the practice of law after his congressional defeat.\n\nRarick ran for the American Independent Party (AIP) nomination in 1976, against Robert Morris (who had Richard Viguerie as his running mate and the backing of \"National Review\"-publisher William A. Rusher) and former Governor of Georgia Lester Maddox. Maddox, who had been widely described as the front-runner prior to the convention, won the nomination on the first ballot, with the support of 177 delegates (52.2%). Morris had the support of 80 delegates (23.6%) and Rarick had 79 (23.3%). In the general election, Maddox would go on to win 170,274 votes (or 0.21%).\n\nRarick then turned his attention to returning to Congress. He ran in the suburban New Orleans-based First District in 1976 as an Independent. The seat had come open when 36-year incumbent F. Edward Hébert announced his retirement. Rarick polled only 12,227 votes (9.4 percent). However, he siphoned off enough votes that presumably otherwise would have gone to Republican Bob Livingston to throw the election to Democrat Richard Alvin Tonry.\n\nIn 1980, Rarick again sought the AIP nomination, competing against Percy L. Greaves Jr., of New York (already the nominee of the American Party) and James Schumacher of Arizona. Both Rarick and Greaves were described as advocating a \"strictly defensive non-intervention[ist] foreign policy\" while Schumacher spoke in favor of arming Israel \"to the teeth\" and the \"complete destruction of the next country that invades Israel.\" In a speech to 150 convention delegates, Rarick outlined a platform which opposed foreign aid and American participation in the United Nations, and citing his congressional votes against the Equal Rights Amendment and funding for abortion. Rarick easily secured the nomination, winning the support of 64 delegates (84.2%) on the first ballot; Greaves had the support of 11 delegates (14.5%) and Schumacher had only a single supporter (1.3%). Eileen Knowland Shearer of California (the wife of AIP founder William K. Shearer) was chosen as Rarick's running mate.\n\nOn the ballot in only eight states, Rarick finished in seventh place, with 40,906 votes (or just 0.05 percent). Rarick's most respectable showings were in Louisiana, where he polled 10,333 votes (0.67 percent and about the same number that Maddox had received four years earlier) and in Alabama where he captured 15,010 votes (1.12 percent). Overall, his totals were so meager as to have been omitted from most presidential election tallies. He opposed the campaign of Republican Ronald Reagan for president that year on the grounds that Reagan, a former governor of California, was too accommodating to the welfare state to address the pressing needs of the nation.\n\nIn 1990, Rarick supported David Duke's candidacy for U.S. Senator against the Democrat J. Bennett Johnston Jr.; Duke won 44 percent of the vote and launched a losing gubernatorial race in 1991.\n\nRarick was awarded the \"Medal of Honor\" from the National Society for the Daughters of the American Revolution. He received the \"Medal of Freedom\" Award from the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation, an organization named for the Hungarian priest, József Mindszenty, who was persecuted and exiled because of his opposition to Joseph Stalin and communist abuses during the Cold War. Rarick was given a \"life achievement award\" by the National Council of Conservative Citizens, a group of which he was a charter member and frequently addressed, along with the late conservative columnist, Samuel T. \"Sam\" Francis. Rarick was named \"Mason of the Century\" by the Feliciana Lodge 31, where he was active for more than a half century and twice served as its worshipful master. He was instrumental in organizing the lodge's annual \"Day the War Stopped\", an annual American Civil War re-enactment.\n\nOn December 27, 1945, Rarick married the former Marguerite Pierce (September 10, 1924 – April 13, 2003), the mother of his three children. On January 21, 2004, the widower Rarick married the former Frances Eldred Campbell, a long-time family friend. In addition to his first wife, he was preceded in death by a grandson, Marc Magee Slattery.\n\nRarick died of cancer at his St. Francisville home at 9:20 p.m., on September 14, 2009. Cherie Brumfield, his daughter and former law partner, told \"Baton Rouge Morning Advocate\" that her father stood up for his lifetime motto: \"For God and the Constitution\", words inscribed on his tombstone. Brumfield said that Rarick had tried to \"wake up America to fight for America.\" She added that her father, despite his Indiana birth, considered himself \"as proud a southerner as anyone born here. He would say, 'I'm a southerner by choice, not chance.\n\nIn addition to his second wife, Rarick is survived by one son, John Rarick, II, and wife Kay, and daughters Cherie Rarick Brumfield and husband, Bill, and Laurie Rarick Slattery and husband, John. He had nine grandchildren: John Rarick, III, and wife Tara; Parrish Rarick; Alecia Rarick Tortorich and husband, Louis; Jodie Brumfield Morrow and husband, Jude; William Brian Brumfield; H. Doyle Magee, III; John Slattery, III; Marguerite Slattery, and Patrick Rarick Slattery. He had six great-grandchildren: Brennan Morrow, Catherine Morrow, Christian Rarick, McKenna Rarick, John Challen Rarick, and Kaitlyn Tortorich. He is also survived by four stepchildren: Scott, Don, and Dave Campbell, and Lori Campbell Teufert; and one step-grandson, Derrick Hyde.\n\nServices were held on September 18, 2009, at the First Baptist Church of St. Francisville, of which Rarick was a member. He is interred beside his first wife at Star Hill Cemetery off U.S. Highway 61 and Louisiana Highway 966 near St. Francisville.\n\nRarick's papers have been donated to Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond.\n\n\n\n"}

He held the European heavyweight title and also challenged for the WBO world heavyweight title.\n\nKrasniqi is the youngest of eight children to Kosovar Albanian parents. He has often said that he had a happy and active childhood, growing up in Junik, a small town in the District of Gjakova, where in 1987 he finished his primary and secondary school, before his family moved to Rottweil in Germany. Krasniqi stated \"\"my childhood was good, but when I learned that we would be rejoining my father who had moved to Rottweil in 1970 I was overjoyed. I had dreamt about a move to the city and now it was coming true!\"\".\n\nKrasniqi graduated in Germany his A-Level and an education as a wholesaler.\n\nKrasniqi started boxing at the age of 16. His boxing-career began at the local BSV Rottweil, where he met Theo Kerekesch, a boxing trainer of high regard.\n\nSpotting talent and kinship within each other, hard work developed Krasniqi into a solid, well schooled, heavyweight. Once Krasniqi had been granted German citizenship, he entered the Multi-Nations Tournament in Liverpool, England and won the gold medal. He consolidated the success with a gold medal later that year at the German Championships, Berlin.\n\nKrasniqi stormed the 1995 World Amateur Boxing Championships, by taking the silver medal beating Sinan Samil Sam and Wladimir Klitschko – losing only to the one of the best amateur boxers of all times, the Cuban great Félix Savón. Krasniqi ended the year on a roll, taking the Heavyweight Gold in the International Chemie Cup Tournament, Halle.\n\n1996 he added the European Championships with a win over Christophe Mendy.\n\nAt the Olympic Games in Atlanta he beat future amateur and professional champion\nRuslan Chagaev and reached a semi-final bout with Félix Savón.\nThe semi-final bout against Félix Savón was short-lived. During the bout, Krasniqi was cut under the eye. The cut would be examined by the ringside doctor & result in a medical stoppage. This left him unable to fight for an Olympic Gold Medal. \n\nKrasniqi returned to Germany with the Bronze medal, Germany's first heavyweight medal since 1976. \"\"I felt that I could have beaten him. He had out-pointed me the previous year but I had grown stronger and developed further since then. I am sure that the fight would have been close but I think that this time, I would have celebrated.\"\" However, Krasniqi had many memories to savour from Atlanta - one of which was a meeting with his idol, Muhammad Ali. \"\"Muhammad Ali was and still is an idol. Nobody can ever achieve what he achieved. Such a thing is a once in a lifetime phenomenon.\"\"\n\n\"\"To shine so long and so brightly, to define eras in history with the sheer force of his ability and personality and to be so well remembered is unique. Meeting him was an honour I shall never forget.\"\" Krasniqi took his first steps to his own fame as he decided to become famous and to get in at Panix Promotions, where Lennox Lewis has his contract.\n\n1996 Olympic Results Boxed as a Heavyweight (– 91 kg)\n\n\nKrasniqi won his first fight (with Harry Senior. In order to improve his training he was invited to train with Lennox Lewis in Big Bear Lake, where he was in preparation for the fight against Andrzej Gołota. Luan showed that he could resist the pressure of sparring with Lewis. Since then, he has been to Big Bear Lake three times.\n\nDuring Lewis' training for the fights against Shannon Briggs, Željko Mavrović and Evander Holyfield he was one of his sparring partners. Luan overcame with success the first hurdles of his career as a \"newcomer\" in professional boxing. He boxed extremely successfully for Panix Promotion 15 times and in 2000 after Lennox Lewis had terminated his contract, Luan decided to look for a new alternative. In February and April 2000 he built his connections with Universum Box-Promotion and fought a number of matches for them. In January 2001 he signed a three years long contract with Universum Box-Promotion.\n\nThe highlight of his career was the fight against Rene Monse, when he became European Champion. He was the first German European Champion after 29 years.\n\nA half year later Krasniqi lost his belt in a fight against Przemysław Saleta. The man from Rottweil was prepared for eight rounds. But after an injury of Vitali Klitschko, his fight was pushed to the main event. Mainly due to this lack of preparation, although leading by points, Krasniqi apparently feared a loss and elected to quit.\n\nAfter this defeat Krasniqi struggled to get back to the top of the European rankings. Finally on 14 February 2004 he won against the \"Bull from Bosphorus\" Sinan Samil Sam and became European Champion once again.\n\n2005 brought Krasniqi to the top of the heavyweight competition after he knocked out highly regarded Lance Whitaker and became a mandatory challenger for the WBO crown. He lost against Lamon Brewster. Brewster managed to efficiently attack Krasniqi's body. This resulted in Krasniqi fatiguing in the latter rounds and finally being forced into a punch-exchange and getting knocked down in round 9.\n\nIt was a disappointing loss to a lot of German and Albanian fans, since the resurrection of a new German heavyweight champion was highly anticipated to occur on Max Schmeling's 100th birthday.\n\nLuan's next fight took place on 29 April 2006 in Stuttgart, Germany where he won against David Bostice.\n\nLuan Krasniqi was scheduled to fight against Top 10 contender, Tony Thompson, in September 2006, but no contract was made. Krasniqi has stated that the money offered by his promoter Klaus-Peter Kohl was insufficient.\n\nOn 17 March 2007, Krasniqi fought Brian Minto for the title of WBO Intercontinental Champion. Despite having a height disadvantage of 4 inches (10 cm), Minto was able to hold his own against Krasniqi. However, in the 12th round Krasniqi was able to knock Minto down and win the match. It was later stated that it was Krasniqi's tactic to tire his adversary. This won Luan Krasniqi the title of Intercontinental Champion and has given him the possibility of a fight against Shannon Briggs.\n\nKransiqi lost to Tony Thompson, putting a serious dent in his hopes at a future title shot. On 11 November 2008, he lost by a third-round knockout to unbeaten Alexander Dimitrenko.\n\nHe is currently an actor.\nPrior to his boxing success, Krasniqi worked in wholesale and foreign trade. Luan Krasniqi's two boxing idols are Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis.\n\nGerman Heavyweight Champion 2001-2002\nEBU Heavyweight Champion 2002, 2004–2005\nWBO Interconti Champion 2007.\n"}

His share for committing the crime was to be $50,000. Joe breaks out of jail with the help of his girl Pat (Claire Trevor). Neither is aware that the escape has been facilitated by their former accomplice Rick Coyle (Raymond Burr), a sadistic mobster, who expects Joe to be killed during his escape and so avoid having to pay Joe his $50,000. When against all expectations the break-out succeeds, Rick decides that he must have Joe killed.\n\nPat and Joe's getaway car is damaged and Joe decides that they will hide out at his legal caseworker Ann's (Marsha Hunt) apartment. Ann had been visiting Joe in prison because she was trying to reform him and also because she was developing feelings for him. When the police close in on Ann's apartment she tries to convince Joe to give himself up. Instead Joe forces Ann to escape with him and Pat. Pat sees the attraction between Joe and Ann and doesn't know what to do about it. Joe finds himself between two women who love him. The three of them continue to evade the police until one of Rick's men finds them. Rick's man (John Ireland) and Joe get into a fight and Ann saves Joe by shooting Rick's man in the back. After acting in Joe's defense this way, Ann realizes how much she is in love with him. Out of loyalty to Pat, Joe sets Ann free and prepares to flee the country with Pat. In Joe and Pat's hotel room, Pat takes a phone call warning them that Rick has seized Ann and will harm her unless Joe and Pat come out of hiding. Pat does not want Joe to go back to Ann, so lies about the call, saying it was from the hotel desk clerk asking about their checkout time. \n\nAfter boarding a ship, Joe attempts to convince Pat that they can start a new life in South America together. He even proposes marriage to her. A guilt-stricken Pat now confesses to Joe that Ann has been abducted by Rick. Joe races to save Ann from her captor. Under the cover of a thick fog, Joe manages to get past Rick's henchmen and sneaks into Rick's room. A gunfight erupts with Rick and Joe shooting each other and inadvertently starting a fire. Joe and Rick, both wounded, fight hand-to-hand with Joe finally pushing Rick through an upper story window to his death. Mortally wounded and lying in the street, Joe dies in Ann's arms as Pat looks on. Seeing the resigned contentment in Joe's face, Pat comments in voice-over that: \"This is right for Joe. This is what he wanted.\"\n\n\nThe film was a success at the box office and was profitable.\n\nWhen the film was released, \"New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther panned it. \"But this, of course, is a movie—and a pretty low-grade one, at that—in which sensations of fright and excitement are more diligently pursued than common sense...Except for the usual moral—to wit, that crime does not pay—the only thing proved by this picture is that you shouldn't switch sweethearts in mid-lam.\"\n\nIn \"Girl and a Gun: The Complete Guide to Film Noir\", David N.

{"id": "2061044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061044", "title": "SOCATA", "text": "SOCATA\n\nSOCATA (later EADS Socata and DAHER-SOCATA) was a French producer of general aviation aircraft propelled by piston engines and turboprops, including business planes, small personal or training aircraft, as well as the production of aircraft structures for other manufacturers such as Airbus, Dassault, Embraer, Eurocopter and Lockheed Martin. The company had its headquarters, along with much of its production capabilities, located in Tarbes, France.\n\nDuring 1966, the French aircraft manufacturer Morane-Saulnier changed its name to SOCATA (which is an abbreviation for \"Societe de Construction d'Avions de Tourisme et d'Affaires\", French for \"Company for the construction of aircraft for tourism and business\") following its acquisition by Sud Aviation. During 2000, SOCATA became a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational aerospace conglomerate EADS; shortly thereafter, the business was rebranded as \"EADS SOCATA\". On 3 November 2008, EADS and French technology business DAHER announced that they had reached a final agreement for DAHER to acquire a 70% stake in EADS SOCATA. In June 2014, DAHER announced that it had acquired the remaining 30% of EADS SOCATA from Airbus Group (formerly EADS). During March 2015, the SOCATA name fell out of use, the company's name having been changed to just \"Daher\" at this time as part of a rebranding to align the division with its parent company.\n\nThe history of SOCATA can be traced back to the founding of the French aircraft manufacturer Morane-Saulnier in 1911. During 1966, Morane-Saulnier changed its name to SOCATA (which is an abbreviation for \"Societe de Construction d'Avions de Tourisme et d'Affaires\", French for \"Company for the construction of aircraft for tourism and business\") following the company's acquisition by the state-owned aerospace interest Sud Aviation. During this period of ownership, SOCATA focused its activities on general aviation, manufacturing thousands of light aircraft throughout the latter half of the 20th century.\nOne of the company's more popular products was the Rallye family of general aircraft. During 1979, SOCATA decided to reorganise and rebrand much of its production programmes, one of the results of which being the renaming of the various models of Rallye series, each one receiving an individual, \"more Gallic\" name. During the 1980s, the Rallye was gradually superseded and phased out of production in France by the newer Socata TB series. During December 1984, the final Rallye of approximately 3,300 aircraft, an armed R235 Guerrier model, was delivered. However, SOCATA's decision to terminate production in France was not the end of all manufacturing activity. During the 1970s, SOCATA had sold a license for the production of the Rallye 100ST model to the Polish State aviation company PZL, which led to the aircraft being independently constructed in its facilities in Warsaw as the \"PZL Koliber\" (\"Humming Bird\"). On 18 April 1978, the first PZL-built aircraft performed its maiden flight and, during the following year, quantity production of the Koliber commenced.\nDuring the mid-1970s, SOCATA commenced work on what would become the TB family of general aircraft; a key ambition of this new product line was to entirely replace the firm's existing and highly successful Rallye series. As intended, throughout 1979, production of the Rallye family was drawn down as production of the new family ramped up; the initial entry models of which were designated as the \"TB-9 Tampico\" and the \"TB-10 Tobago\". On 18 December 1980, an improved model of the aircraft, designated as the \"TB20\", was awarded its type certification by the French aviation authorities. During Match 1981, the first delivery of a production TB20 was completed to a German customer. Various improved models of the TB series were subsequently developed.\n\nSOCATA adopted a straightforward assembly philosophy at its final assembly facility in Tarbes, choosing to only complete a given aircraft after having already received an order for it. Basic airframes would be produced in advanced and finished upon order, allowing for customer-specified modifications and optional equipment to be installed as per their demands. While the type was completed upon a single assembly line at the facility, all models, low and top end alike, were finished upon the same line. At the start of 1993, SOCATA was manufacturing around 12 aircraft of the TB series per month, by the middle of the year, this had dipped to roughly 8 aircraft per month.\n\nDuring the 1980s, SOCATA, having identified a vacant market position for a purpose-built optimised single-engine aircraft capable of fast personal transport and light cargo duties, became interested in the piston-powered Mooney 301 light aircraft of the Mooney Airplane Company. Accordingly, talks commenced between Mooney and SOCATA on the subject of producing a turboprop-powered derivative of the 301. The product that emerged from these discussions was a new design, referred to as the \"TBM 700\", which was considerably heavier than the original 301 while provisioned with more than twice the available power. The prefix of the designation, \"TBM\", originated from the initials \"TB\", which stands for Tarbes, the French city in which SOCATA is located, while the \"M\" stands for Mooney. At the time of its conception, while several aviation companies had studied or were otherwise considering the development of such an aircraft, the envisioned TBM 700 was the first high-performance single-engine passenger/cargo aircraft to enter production. From the onset, key performance criteria were established, demanding a high level of reliability while also being capable of an unequalled speed/altitude combination amongst the TBM 700 other single-engined peers.\n\nConsequently, during June 1987, a joint venture, named \"TBM International\", was established with the aim of completing development of the TBM 700 design and to perform the manufacture of the new aircraft; the ownership of the joint venture was divided between Mooney and SOCATA's then parent company, Aérospatiale. A pair of separate production lines for the TBM 700 were planned, one located at Mooney's facility in Kerrville, Texas, which was intended to cater to the American market, and the other based at SOCATA's factory in Tarbes, which was set to produce aircraft for customers throughout the rest of the world. However, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mooney was afflicted by persistent fiscal shortfalls; consequently, in May 1991, Mooney chose to withdraw from participation in the joint venture, leaving SOCATA as the primary company involved in the programme.\n\nOn 14 July 1988, the first TBM 700 prototype conducted the type's maiden flight. Flight testing proved that virtually all of the established goals of the design had been achieved, leading to quick progress towards production. On 31 January 1990, type certification was received from French authorities; it was followed by the awarding of US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on 28 August 1990. During early 1990, the first delivery of a TBM 700 occurred; the first production batch of 50 aircraft were sold out almost instantly. Early feedback received from operators and pilots was typically positive about the capabilities of the new aircraft, often praising its speed and generous power margins amongst other attributes. According to aerospace publication \"Flying\", while the TBM 700 had rapidly proved popular and a good aircraft on its own merits, the services and support facilities SOCATA provided were an initial point of weakness. SOCATA, recognising the critical importance of an effective support infrastructure, invested heavily in improving worldwide support for the type; instead of being solely reliant upon third parties and partnership arrangements with other companies, the firm developed their own facilities. SOCATA opened its own service center in Florida, as well as establishing a network of distributors capable of both sales and services for the TBM 700. Consequently, during the late 1990s, sales of the type within the North American market rose dramatically.\n\nDuring 2000, SOCATA became a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational aerospace conglomerate EADS; shortly thereafter, the business was rebranded as \"EADS SOCATA\". On 27 June 2008, EADS announced its intention to sell a controlling interest in EADS SOCATA to French technology business DAHER, but would retain a minority stake in the company. On 3 November 2008, EADS and DAHER announced that they had reached a final agreement for DAHER to acquire a 70% stake in EADS SOCATA. On 7 January 2009, DAHER confirmed its acquisition of a majority 70% stake in SOCATA.\n\nDuring late 2009, it was announced that EADS SOCATA had finalised an agreement with a private company, JetSet International Ltd, for the sale of the type certificate, tooling, components, engineering plans and drawings for the Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris, a jet-powered business jet developed by SOCATA's predecessor. The firm had separately purchased in excess of 30 retired MS760s from the French and Argentinian governments; JetSet International Ltd reportedly had ambitions to refurbish these existing airframes and to install current-generation jet engines and avionics for the purpose of selling them on to operators for approximately $550,000.\n\nIn June 2014, DAHER announced that it had acquired the remaining 30% of EADS SOCATA from Airbus Group (formerly EADS), making it a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. During March 2015, use of the SOCATA name was formally discontinued, the division having been rebranded as just \"Daher\" to more closely align itself with its new parent company.\n\n\n"}

CEMF is the EMF caused by magnetic induction (see Faraday's law of induction, electromagnetic induction, Lenz's law).\n\nFor example, the voltage appearing across an inductor or coil is due to a change in current which causes a change in the magnetic field within the coil, and therefore the self-induced voltage. The polarity of the voltage at every moment opposes that of the change in applied voltage, to keep the current constant.\n\nThe term \"back electromotive force\" is also commonly used to refer to the voltage that occurs in electric motors where there is relative motion between the armature and the magnetic field produced by the motor's field coils, thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor. This effect is not due to the motor's inductance, but a separate phenomenon.\n\nThis voltage is in series with and opposes the original applied voltage and is called \"back-electromotive force\" (by Lenz's law). With a lower overall voltage across the motor's internal resistance as the motor turns faster, the current flowing into the motor decreases. One practical application of this phenomenon is to indirectly measure motor speed and position, as the back-EMF is proportional to the rotational speed of the armature.\n\nIn motor control and robotics, back-EMF often refers most specifically to actually using the voltage generated by a spinning motor to infer the speed of the motor's rotation, for use in better controlling the motor in specific ways.\n\nTo observe the effect of back-EMF of a motor, one can perform this simple exercise: with an incandescent light on, cause a large motor such as a drill press, saw, air conditioner compressor, or vacuum cleaner to start. The light may dim briefly as the motor starts. When the armature is not turning (called locked rotor) there is no back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the motor's starting current is high enough, it will pull the line voltage down enough to cause noticeable dimming of the light.\n\n"}

It is located in its original location at the south end of the Humanities and Social Sciences Campus of Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. Today, it is managed by the local government. Twice a year in May and September, the ceremonial rite \"Seokjeon Daeje\" is performed in the Munmyo Shrine portion of the old campus to honor Confucius and the Confucian sages of China and Korea.\n\n\n\nGukjagam (국자감, 國子監), the highest educational institution during the Goryeo Dynasty, was established in November 992 by King Seongjong in Goryeo's capital city, Gaegyeong (개경) (Modern day Kaesong. It was originally a palace outbuilding called Taemyon (태묜).\n\nIn 1089, under the reign of King Munjong new official buildings were constructed.\n\nIts name was changed to Seonggyungam (성균감) in 1298.\n\nIn 1304 it was reestablished by Neo-Confucian scholar An Hyang who is considered the founder of Neo-Confucianism in Korea.\n\nThe name was changed to Seonggyungwan in 1308 under reign of King Chungnyeol.\n\nThe name was changed back to Gukjagam in 1358 during the reign of King Gongmin.\n\nIn 1362 the name was changed back to Seonggyungwan.\n\nAfter the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, King Taejo decided to relocate Sungkyunkwan to Hanyang, modern day Seoul, and also founded 360 Hyanggyos nationwide in July 1398, establishing a national education system.\n\nSungkyunkwan was established in Hanyang on September 25, 1398.\n\nA fire destroyed some buildings in 1400 which were rebuilt in 1407.\n\nIn 1418 King Taejong initiated a tradition for royal princes to enter Sungkyunkwan.\n\nDuring the reign of the tyrannical King Yeongsangun, Sungkyunkwan was turned into a personal pleasure ground. When he was deposed, it was restored to its former status.\n\nSungkyunkwan was rebuilt again in 1601 after many buildings were burnt down including the Munmyo area during the Japanese invasions (1592 - 1598).\n\nIn 1784, Byeokipjae (벽입재, 闢入齋) was destroyed by a fire. It is no longer present on the current campus grounds.\n\nIn 1869 there was a major renovation/restoration of the old campus.\n\nIn 1894 the Gabo Reform occurred which abolished the national state examinations during the reign of King Gojong.\n\nIn 1895, Sungkyunkwan was reformed into a modern three-year university.\n\nDuring the Colonial Era between 1910–1945, royal Sungkyunkwan was demoted to a private institution and renamed Gyunghakwon (경학원, 經學院), while Korean education was prohibited and Japanese education was forced nationwide.\n\nAfter Korea gained independence in 1945, Gyeonghakwon was renamed to Sungkyunkwan and with funding from Yurim (Confucians) nationwide, Sungkyunkwan University was established.\n\nDuring the Korean War (June 25, 1950 – July 27, 1953), much of the campus was destroyed. Daeseongjeon, however, remained.\n\nIn 1954 Gyeseongsa (계성사, 啓聖祠) was removed. Gyeseongsa was the shrine for the parents of the Confucian sages. It used to house the spirit tablets of the important family members of Confucian scholars.\n\nThe latest renovation/restoration occurred in 1988.\n\nThere was Japanese-style landscaping throughout the old campus left over from the Colonial Era that was eventually removed over the most recent decades to restore Sungkyunkwan to its original Joseon Era form.\n\n\nThere are also some buildings, structures, and features that were removed:\nThe institution's administrator had a government rank of sampum (삼품), with lower-ranking officials of Jwaeju (좨주), Akjeong (악정), Jikgang (직강), Baksa (박사), Hakjeong (학정), Haknok (학록), and Hagyu (학유) as supporting staff.\n\nThe old campus was designed based on geomancy. Sungkyunkwan was built with the mountains behind it to the north and the front facing south towards water (한강, Hangang, The Han River, and Bansu (반수), the creek that used to run around the front of the campus). This was based on superstition as well as function. The sunlight and wind patterns were considered most ideal when the buildings were arranged this way.\n\nThe buildings are constructed of red pine which was considered very special in the Joseon Dynasty and laypeople were forbidden from logging them. Korean aristocrats believed red pine represented the Confucian virtues of “fidelity” and “fortitude”. Today red pine is even mentioned in the South Korean national anthem “Aegukga” (애국가, 愛國歌).\n\nThe windows were made using window paper (한지, 韓紙, Hanji). The paper used was handmade from the inner bark of Paper mulberry which grows on rocky Korean mountainsides (닥). This was combined with the mucilage that oozes from the roots of Abelmoschus manihot which helps suspend the individual fibers in water. The hanji is made in laminated sheets using the we bal (외 발) sheet formation method allowing for a multi-directional grain. The finished sheets are then pounded using a method called dochim (도침) to compact the fibers and lessen ink bleed.\n\nThe stone platforms (기단, Gidan) used for several of Sungkyunkwan's buildings are made of rectangular granite slabs fit together into a rectangular structure. The height of the platforms symbolizes the importance of the buildings. Much of the stonework from the original construction of the buildings remains exposed. There is also a sizeable percentage that is still present but has been buried beneath the structures due to time and renovations/reconstructions.\n\nPlatform stones (주춧돌, Juchutdol) are stones in which pillars rest on. They block humidity from the ground as well as bear the load of the pillars in order to efficiently redistribute the weight of the building to the ground.\n\nThe timber framed structures contain such components as:\nThe different types of pillars (기둥, Gidung) used are:\nThe types of wooden flooring are:\nThe floors of many of the buildings were equipped with ondol traditional radiant floor heating.\n\nThe buildings are painted based on the Korean art of painting buildings which is called Dancheong (단청) which means “red and green”. The incorporation of the five elements epitomizes ancient Korean's desire for stability and peace in the present life and a rewarding afterlife. The brightly colored paint on buildings is not only for decoration, it is also for protecting the buildings from weather, rot, vermin, and evil spirits as well as emphasize the authority of their residents. The red-colored paint on Sungkyunkwan's buildings symbolizes nobility. Only the most important buildings are painted red. There are five basic colors: blue, red, black, white, and yellow which symbolize the five traditional elements. Blue means east, dragon, spring, and wood. Red means south, birds, summer, and fire. White means west, tiger, fall, and gold. Black means north, hyeonmu, winter, and water. Yellow means center, the periods between seasons, and Earth.\n\nThe roofs (Jibung, 지붕) are made of clay tiles (기와, Giwa) and are decorated with figurines called japsang (잡상). There is always an odd number of the smaller japsang. The most a building can have is 11. The purpose of the roof decorations goes back to the Korean shamanic religion and they are intended to chase away evil spirits and misfortune as well as show the dignity and grandeur of a building. The first few japsang on a roof are usually characters from the Chinese classic Journey to the West. The types of japsang are:\nThere are four types of roofs in Joseon Era architecture used at Sungkyunkwan which are matbae (맞배, gable), ujingak (우진각, hipped), paljak (팔작, hip-and-gable), and samo (사모, pyramid).\n\nCourtyards (안마당, Anmadang) were an important aspect of Joseon Dynasty architecture. They served a practical purpose of allowing large groups to congregate for meetings and activities. Beyond this, they fulfilled the Joseon aesthetic principle of the pure beauty of empty space. Korean buildings were designed to be in close harmony with nature which is reflected in many ways, none more so than in the use of courtyards, complete with trees and vegetation, within the walled-in areas.\n\nThe name signboards on structures (간판, Ganpan) are large wooden signs written in Hanja and served to identify them as well as display their importance. More important buildings had special names and their signs were larger and more decorative.\n\nThe windows (창문, Changmun) were made of wooden frames lined with hanji paper allowing for natural air to penetrate through the windows as well natural light to enter the room. The height and size of windows was based on the standard height and shoulder width of an adult person. The height of window frames was designed to be low enough to rest an elbow on but high enough to conceal a person lying down.\n\nThe primary written language of Sungkyunkwan was hanja. Although hangul was invented in 1443, it did not become the primary language of study because the literary elite believed that the difficult hanja was more sophisticated. Hangul was invented to solve the widespread illiteracy of the common people at the time, but it was considered a threat by many in the upper class to their status as literary scholars, leading them to resist its implementation. As a result, hanja remained the written language used at Sungkyunkwan requiring anyone who wished to rise to the top levels of the government to be capable of reading and writing the characters.\n\nSungkyunkwan's teachings were mainly Confucian-related, and were primarily aimed at preparing students for government service. Students also studied law, medicine, interpretation, accounting, archery, mathematics, music, and etiquette.\n\nThe main goal was for the students to pass the higher national civil-service examinations (\"gwageo\"). Like their Chinese counterpart, these examinations were on writing ability, knowledge of the Confucian classics, and proposals of management of the state (governance). Technical subjects were also included to appoint experts in medicine, interpretation, accounting, and law.\n\nPoetry was a big part of both the students’ studies and communication. It was viewed as noble and proof of the students’ high-born lineage. They were heavily encouraged to read and compose poetry.\n\nThe students were required to write lengthy essays on a regular basis that were subject to strict criticism from their instructors. The middle ten days of every month were dedicated to literary exercises. There were regular tests every 10 days and there were also daily quizzes.\n\nThe original set number of students was 150 when Sungkyunkwan was founded, which was raised to 200 in 1429. All of the students were male and women were forbidden from entering the campus.\n\nBooks on Buddhism and Taoism were banned.\n\nJoseon Era students attended Seodang from ages 5 or 6 where they learned rudimentary penmanship, basic essential skills, and the Chinese classics. The students’ education began with reading the \"Thousand Character Classic\". The teaching methodology emphasized rote learning by reading and memorizing an assigned passed each day. Once a student read something more than one hundred times, they would recite it to their teacher (훈장, Hunjang). At age 15 or 16 students entered hyanggyo or seowon (서원, 書院, Private primary school) for advanced studies targeted on passing examinations. They would study there for five or six years.\n\nEntrance examinations for Sungkyunkwan were extremely harsh and were only allowed for the sons of yangban, the Joseon Era upper class or royalty. There were two ways to be accepted into Sungkyunkwan. Either the students had to pass the two admission exams, Saeng-wonsi (생원시) and Jinsasi (진사시), or take the other two examinations, Seungbo (승보) and Eumseo (음서). If they passed these examinations, they were given the opportunity to be accepted.\n\nStudents lived very comfortably on full scholarship and were waited on by servants.\n\nStudents were informed of the time throughout the day by drum beats. One beat indicated the time to get up (6:00 AM every day), two beats meant it was time to dress neatly and read, and three beats meant it is meal time.\n\nIn the early morning, when the drum was sounded signaling the start of the day, students would prostrate themselves once before entering Myeongnyundang to receive a lecture on Confucianism.\n\nClasses were held at the Lecture Hall from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\n\nThe students were divided into 2 classes based on academic abilities\n\nIf students received low marks they were punished and publicly humiliated.\n\nStudents would sneak out after 10:00 PM to study more.\n\nStudents would sometimes appeal to the king about unjust decisions and if they were rejected they would stage political demonstrations, fast, or boycott classes.\n\nThe 8th and 23rd days of each month were washing days for the student's clothing.\n\nThe students' uniforms were originally red then changed to sky blue to symbolize the endless spring of knowledge.\n\nThroughout the Joseon Era the students were divided into multiple political factions (붕당, 朋黨, Bungdang) that influenced the national politics and the study of Neo-Confucianism. Originally the Hungu faction was the most dominant and the more radical Sarim faction was often subject to violent purges to eliminate political opponents. Eventurally the Sarim became the dominant faction. The Sarim, however, split many times into smaller factions over the following centuries due to political in-fighting. The students at Sungkyunkwan would often play important roles in these political conflicts.\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty the highest aspiration those in the upper class could have was to be a seonbi (선비, Virtuous Scholar). They believed that the more important way to improve oneself was through continuious study while adhering to the principles of Confucianism. Much of this can still be seen in modern Korean culture's emphasis on the importance of education and respect for one's elders or superiors.\n\nThe requirements for graduation included:\n\nThe king, as a disciple before Confucius, would take off his royal robes and wear plain clothes before stepping into the courtyard of the Confucian Shrine. The kings would usually never set foot on the ground outside of the palaces anywhere but Sungkyunkwan.\n\nThe path between Sinsammun and Daeseongjeon was originally considered sacred and only for the spirits. People were not allowed to step on it or face punishment. Even today the Confucian keepers of the shrine bow before stepping on it.\n\nStudents were not allowed to have pets.\n\nAlcohol consumption was allowed within reason and students were sometimes given liquor or wine as a present.\n\nThe worst offense a student could commit, resulting in them not being allowed to take the state exams was not showing instructors proper respect or making disparaging remarks about them.\n\nThe students had the right to protest which they often did for various academic and political reasons.\n\nYi I, a famous Joseon scholar and politician is an alumnus and is featured on the 5,000 won bill.\n\nKing Sejong is an alumnus and is featured on the 10,000 won bill.\n\nShin Saimdang, Yi I's mother, is on the 50,000 won bill.\n\nChojip (초집) were how-to guide booklets used by cheaters.\n\nThe sodu (소두) was the chairman of a committee who would put forth appeals to the king.\n\nThe students' class list was called the cheonggeum nok (청금곡, 靑矜錄, Blue Robe Book).\n\nSungkyunkwan was featured prominently in the popular Korean drama \"Sunkyunkwan Scandal\".\n\n\n\n"}

The station broadcasts at 990 kHz (AM). CBW is a Class A Clear-channel station reserved for Canada under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement allocations.\n\nCBW's studios are located on Portage Avenue in Downtown Winnipeg, while its transmitters are located near Beaudry Provincial Park in Springstein.\n\nDue to the station's transmitter power and Manitoba's mostly flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), it reaches almost all of southern Manitoba during the day and much of the middle portion of North America at night. The station is simulcast on a low-power FM station at 89.3 MHz (with a transmitter atop Bell MTS Place Main, in downtown Winnipeg).\n\nAn early demonstration of radio by Lee DeForest took place in Winnipeg in April 1910, with extensive amateur and experimental interest after that date. Regularly scheduled broadcasting did not begin until the spring of 1922, when Lynn Salton established a private station with the call sign CKZC. Both Winnipeg daily newspapers developed their own radio stations in 1922, notably providing coverage of the 1922 Provincial election. However, the stations were found to be expensive to operate. In January 1923, the newspapers agreed to get out of the broadcasting business in favor of the government-owned station. \n\nThe station first signed on March 13, 1923 as CKY, owned and operated by the Manitoba Telephone System,with a transmitter power of 500 watts at a frequency of 665 kHz. It became a partial affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission in 1933, and was purchased outright by the CBC in 1948. The station adopted its current call sign a few months after the CBC purchase, and the CKY call sign was reassigned to a new commercial radio station in 1949. \n\nCBW was part of the \"Trans-Canada Network\", which was the main CBC radio network, while CKRC carried programming from the \"Dominion Network\" between January 1, 1944 and 1962.\n\nThe transmitter was originally located in Carman. On February 3, 1952, a small plane with 3 passengers struck the Carman tower, due to heavy fog. None of the passengers survived. Three tower workers were killed when the tower collapsed during efforts to replace a missing guy wire. \n\nOn July 29, 1992, CBW was authorized to decrease its night-time power from 50,000 watts to 46,000 watts and relocate the transmitter from Carman to a new site near Springstein. On October 15, 1993, CBW began broadcasting from the new site, which was 30 miles closer to Winnipeg than the old site. \n\nCBW moved from the 3rd floor of the \"Telephone Building\" on Portage Avenue East to its current location on Portage Avenue, broadcasting from the new location for the first time on July 5, 1953. The opening officially occurred on September 25, 1953. Over the next week, the station held open house tours of the station. The building cost $1 million to construct and was state of the art at the time.\n\nToday, CBW shares this same location with CBW-FM and CBWT-DT.\n\nOn March 16, 2006, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application by the CBC for a \"nested\" FM rebroadcaster in Winnipeg as a simulcast of CBW. The station had long been plagued by poor coverage in portions of Winnipeg itself, and the FM repeater was intended to improve reception in these areas. CBW-1-FM 89.3 operates from a transmitter atop MTS Bell Place Main, and has an effective radiated power of 2,800 watts.\n\nThe call sign CBW was previously used by the CBC Radio station in Windsor, Ontario in 1937-38 until it was shut down. When it was revived in 1950, the Windsor CBC outlet became CBE.\n\nCBW's local programs are \"Information Radio\" in the morning, \"Radio Noon\" and \"Up to Speed\" in the afternoon; \"The Weekend Morning Show\" runs on Saturdays and Sundays, and the arts and culture show \"Manitoba Scene\" at 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays in addition to \"North Country\" programming weekdays at 7:30 a.m. and 12 p.m. CT.\n\nCBWK-FM Thompson and its rebroadcasters also air programming from the CBC Manitoba studio in Winnipeg (with the exception of \"Information Radio\").\n\nCBW has the following rebroadcasters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Belgium and grew up in the Netherlands. He started making music in the eighties, and spent his time making a name for himself in the 1990s. Since 2001, he released six solo studio albums, one live album CD/DVD set, a book/DVD set, a greatest hits box set, and a few other successful side projects.\n\nGertjan Mulder was born in Antwerp, Belgium as the son of a progressive Dutch minister and a Dutch mother. He was raised in Alphen aan den Rijn in the Netherlands, where he became a fan of hip hop and rap. He started rapping in the mid eighties, imitating heroes like Run DMC, and Eric B & Rakim. He wrote his first rap song in 1988. He moved back to the place where his mother was born, Amsterdam, in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, he entered the Grote Prijs van Nederland, a national talent show for Dutch musicians, in the category of hip hop, winning in four out of five awards, including both the grand jury award and the public appreciation award.\n\nIn 1999, he was featured on the Top-40 hit, Extince track \"Zoete Inval\" (\"Sweet Incursion\"), with several other Dutch-language rap artists. In 2000, Brainpower was both seen and heard in the video clip of the song \"Als niet Als\" (\"If not If\"), by the renowned pop /reggae musicians of classic Dutch supergroup Doe Maar. In that same year, he had his first solo hit-song and video, \"Door Merg en Brain\" (\"Through Marrow and Brain\").\n\nFebruary 2001, Brainpower released his first album, named after the hit single \"Door Merg en Brain\". It contains a number of songs. some basic boombap Hip Hop, and some with an emotional touch, like the critically acclaimed and now famous \"Je Moest Waarschijnlijk Gaan\" (\"You Probably had to Go\"), referring to the suicide killing of one of his best friends. Ten years later the track is considered iconic and is known to comfort many people in times of mourning. four singles and videos are taken from the album and Brainpower tours the whole year 'round.\n\nIn 2002, Brainpower released his second album 'Verschil Moet Er Zijn' . 'Dansplaat' (\"Dance Track\")was the first single to be released, and it swiftly topped the charts in both the Netherlands and Belgium. The single broke records, debuting at #1 on many charts. In the same year, Brainpower won two Dutch Awards (TMF Awards for Best NL Hip Hop Act & Silver Harp for most promising Artist) and also an MTV Award for best Dutch act. He is the only solo MC out of the Benelux ever to win such accolades. Brainpower continues to push the envelope for Dutch and Belgian Hip Hop and has even collaborated with Hip Hop Legend Nas.\n\nIn 2003, Brainpower won a second TMF Award as well as an Edison Award (Dutch Grammy's) for Best National Hip Hop act. Brainpower also released a two-disc DVD/CD containing live versions of many of the songs of his first two albums performed LIVE for the Box PURE Sessions. The rapper performed with a 7-piece band and a string section of 5, plus had guest appearances by (long time Prince sax player) Candy Dulfer and Berget Lewis. The second album sparked an 18-month tour including shows in 7 countries. This stands as the longest tour in Dutch Hip Hop History to coincide with one album.\n\nIn 2002 he started a new project called ADHD, altering the acronym's meaning to \"Aanbevolen Dagelijkse Hoeveelheid Dopeness\" (\"Daily Recommended Dosage of Dopeness\"). The group recorded their album in 2002-2003 and released it in 2004 and was the first ever Rap Group out of the Netherlands to have their own sneaker. Brainpower also wins his third consecutive TMF Award for Best NL Hip Hop Act and his first MOBO Award in London, UK, (for Best Urban TV Show) for his Hip Hop TV show MTV Raw, which he hosts with Too Tall & DJ TLM.

The company's headquarters are currently located at 5160 Orbitor Drive in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nWhen the telegraph and telex businesses went into decline, CN Telegraphs and CP Telegraphs, aligned with their respective railways, formed a joint venture in 1967, CNCP Telecommunications, to operate the telegraph and telex business more profitably. CNCP applied in 1983 to operate a long-distance network in competition with the incumbent local telephone companies' long-distance services. The application was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.\n\nCNCP later changed its name to Unitel Communications Inc., and in 1990 it made a second bid to compete in the long-distance markets of Bell Canada, BC Tel and the four Atlantic telephone companies under that name. At the time, only these four companies and Northwestel, another telecommunications company, were under federal regulation. The bid was successful, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) opened the Canadian telephone market to long-distance competition. At the time of the decision, Alberta's AGT (later known as Telus) also had come under federal regulation, and all other Canadian carriers followed before the end of the 1990s. Each was opened to competition at different time.\n\nUnitel, unable to compete successfully in the environment it had created, was then sold to Rogers Communications, where the company attempted to enter the competition for long-distance communication. Later, the company was sold to a consortium of Canadian banks, with AT&T Communications owning 33% share, but more than any one of the banks, giving them operational control.\n\nFor a time during the 1990s, there were Canadian TV spots for Unitel starring Steven Weber of \"Wings\".\n\nThe telegram division was sold off to iTelegram in 2002 and renamed Telegrams Canada.\n\nUnitel underwent turnaround management by CEO Bill Catucci, allowing it to be renamed AT&T Canada Long Distance Services. AT&T Canada was a Canadian long-distance telephone service provider, the Canadian subsidiary of AT&T Communications. In 1999, the company also merged with Metronet Communications of Calgary, Alberta. In 2003, the company was renamed Allstream as a result of AT&T's declining participation in the company. AT&T sold its remaining interests in the Canadian company in 2004.\n\nThe company was subsequently acquired by MTS in 2004, and was renamed MTS Allstream Inc. until 2012, when it was divided into two separate companies, MTS Inc. and Allstream Inc.\n\nAllstream was to be sold to Accelero Capital in May 2013, with the deal expected to close by the end of the year. However, on October 7, 2013, the Canadian Government blocked the sale over \"concerns of national security\", noting that \"MTS Allstream operates a national fibre optic network that provides critical telecommunications services to businesses and governments, including the Government of Canada.\"\n\nAllstream was sold to US fibre optic provider Zayo Group on January 15, 2016.\n"}

Of all of the \"project\" (semi-temporary) bands that he has formed since the disbanding of Firehose in 1994, The Black Gang (named after Navy slang for sailors who work on a boat's or submarine's engine room) has gone through the most permutations of any of Watt's backing groups.\n\nFor the recording of the album in May 1997, Watt tapped guitarist Nels Cline (whom he had recorded and toured with on his previous solo album, \"Ball-Hog or Tugboat?\") and sometime Tom Waits drummer Stephen Hodges. Commitments with the Geraldine Fibbers kept Cline from touring with Watt for most of the tour, forcing Watt to hire former Saccharine Trust guitarist Joe Baiza to replace him. Watt's longtime soundman since Firehose, Steve Reed, was officially added to the touring lineup as well, singing backing vocals from behind the mixing board and playing sound effects for some of the songs (via a CD-R through the board) on cue in addition to his normal sound reinforcement duties. \n\nA one-time five-member version of the band with both Cline and Baiza playing guitar along with Watt, Hodges and Reed, played a one-off gig in Long Beach in 1998 that was recorded and later released as bonus download-only tracks on the 20th Anniversary vinyl release of \"...Engine Room\" and as a separate digital-only album, \"Contemplating the Engine Room: Live at Jillian's, Long Beach '98 - Five-Man Opera\". \n\nHodges left the band for other commitments and was replaced by Bob Lee in 1998, starting with a spring European tour. Baiza then departed The Black Gang after some work-related conflicts with Watt; Cline was by then able to rejoin the band for one last tour leg behind the album. To mark the occasion, Cline composed a new song, \"This is a Prayer\", which was debuted during his tour stint, and later immortalized on a 7\" EP released on the Kill Rock Stars label.\n\nAfter retiring the piece, Watt continued to play some gigs with the Cline/Lee Black Gang lineup. An intention by Watt to record a new album with this lineup was derailed by a near-fatal illness Watt suffered in January 2000, which would inspire his next solo album, \"The Secondman's Middle Stand\". \n\nWatt and Cline frequently play together as members of the improvisational jazz/punk ensemble Banyan, in between Cline's commitments with Wilco and as a solo artist, and Watt's own schedule with Iggy Pop & The Stooges and as a solo act. \n\nWatt reformed the Nels Cline/Bob Lee version of The Black Gang for a new album, recorded in 2009 in a marathon three-day recording session. The album has yet to be released but was originally set for a 2015 release on Watt's own clenchedwrench label. \n\nWatt and Hodges reunited when the latter was tapped to play drums with mssv, replacing Jim Keltner who had recorded with Watt and Mike Baggetta on the album \"Wall of Flowers\" but was adverse to touring. \n"}
{"id": "2061112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061112", "title": "Marching Through Georgia (novel)", "text": "Marching Through Georgia (novel)\n\nMarching Through Georgia is an alternate history novel by American writer S. M. Stirling, the first of four books in the series The Domination. The novel was released in the United States on May 1, 1988.\n\nThe novel also attempts to educate the reader on the background of the Domination. Government, military, social structures, and the historical development of the Draka are all outlined here.\n\nThe paperback edition contains the full version of Stirling's story. A hardcover version containing all three books of the trilogy was released, however it is abridged.\n\nThe story starts with Centurion Eric von Shrakenberg in a cargo airplane with his airborne unit and the embedded American correspondent William Dreiser, on their way to their drop point, where they will jump and parasail into Nazi-controlled Georgia. The Nazis have been much more successful than in our history, since the Soviets had to divert resources to defend their southern border against the Domination of the Draka. As a result, the Nazis managed to overrun European Russia. The Soviet Union has been pushed back and only controls territories east of the Ural Mountains. However, the Germans are seriously overstretched, and vulnerable to a strong attack.\nDuring the travel to their drop zone, Eric thinks back on his past and his relationship with his father, and his most recent visit home to see his family. This was the first visit in several years, his exile was due to his arranging the escape of his serf daughter to America. Eric's bravery in the earlier Draka conquest of Italy led to his former \"mistake\" being forgiven.\n\nEric's \"Century\" (a term derived from the Roman Empire's army) ends up being seriously under-supplied because the gliders with the artillery went into a canyon. The engineers are frantically building a rubble ramp, but the heavy weapons won't be available for the battle. The story details how Eric's single infantry company takes and holds a small village strategically located on the crucial Ossetian Military Highway over the Caucasus Mountains. The balance of the First Airborne Legion is the plug which is holding four German divisions from escaping the trap they are in on the south side of the mountains. Eric's unit is tasked with holding the highway and village against repeated attacks by Felix Hoth's Waffen-SS armored regiment, which is fighting to clear the highway so the German divisions can escape. Eric's company manages to hold out long enough for the Draka to crush the four divisions, cross the mountains, and relieve his unit. Holding this highway and village is the critical act of the invasion of Russia. This lets the Draka's essentially undamaged and superior armored and mechanized units to penetrate into the plains of Southern Russia, where they can bring to battle and destroy the overstretched and exhausted German forces. It also leads to Eric being awarded the Domination's highest medal of valor, the aurora, \"for saving 10,000 Citizen lives,\" and which makes him immune to Security Directorate reprisals for his \"treasonous utterances\" or for his earlier \"indiscretion.\" The action of Century A is the pivotal event at the beginning of the invasion of Russia that allows the Domination to eventually win the Eurasian War.\n\n\nAlgis Budrys reported that \"Marching Through Georgia\" \"is not, in other words, a novel at all, and will be a disappointment if you read it with the wrong expectation\"; he noted that while it was \"interesting,\" it presented \"real battles in an unreal world.\"\n\nThe book's title is derived from the well-known American Civil War song \"Marching Through Georgia\". Caroline Housmans wrote in her review:\"To a reader coming to this book and unexpectedly encountering the highly unpleasant Draka society dreamed up by Mr. Stirling, the title creates a double confusion. First, the Georgia of this book is the Caucasian country rather than the US State of the same name. More fundamentally, the song celebrates troops who fought to emancipate slaves, while the book's Draka troops are fighting to spread and extend slavery, to enslave everybody who is not a Draka. If this is Stirling's idea of a joke, in this commentator's view it is a poor one.\"\n"}
{"id": "2061117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061117", "title": "Slip (clothing)", "text": "Slip (clothing)\n\nA slip is a woman's undergarment worn beneath a dress or skirt. A full slip hangs from the shoulders, usually by means of narrow straps, and extends from the breast to the fashionable skirt length. A half slip (or waist slip) hangs from the waist. The word \"petticoat\" may also be used for half or full slips.\n\nSlips serve various purposes. They help a dress or skirt hang properly. They protect the skin from chafing against coarse fabrics such as wool; conversely, if the outer garment is made of fine fabric, a slip protects it from perspiration. A slip may be worn for warmth, especially if the dress or skirt is lightweight and thin, whereas in very warm and/or humid climates, a slip made from 100% cotton may be desired. Slips are often worn to prevent the show through of intimate undergarments such as panties or a brassiere. A slip may also be used to prevent a silhouette of the legs showing through clothing when standing in front of a bright light source.\n\nSlips fall into two major categories. A full slip is hung from the shoulders by straps that extend down to the top of the breast area. Full slips come in a variety of lengths; some extend down to the upper thigh, some to just above the knees, or just below the knees, while others go down to just above the ankles. \n\nA waist slip, sometimes referred to as a \"half slip\", is held on to the body around the waist by means of an elastic waistband. The waist slip is also available in the same lengths as the aforementioned full slip. Waist slips that extend down to just above the ankle are often called \"formal\", or \"maxi\" slips. \"Mini slips\" are yet another size option for waist slips. They were first introduced in the 1960s to wear under a mini skirt. American Maid manufactured waist slips that had vents and a rear zipper in addition to the elastic waistband. These slips were made of 50% nylon and 50% dacron polyester. As an alternative to the full slip, a waist slip with a matching camisole can be worn. \n\nThere is also a type of \"slip\" designed to be worn under pants known as \"pettipants\". In addition to pants, a pettipant may also be worn under a dress or skirt, and like slips, they are mainly made of nylon.\n\nMany slips have floral lace at the hem and/or the \"vents\" or \"sideslits\". Some of the older slips have decorations, such as a butterfly or flowers sewn into the fabric of the slip, and a pillowtab was also added to the waistband of a waist slip. The vast majority of slips are made of 100% nylon, while others are made from polyester, rayon, acetate, silk or in some cases cotton. Still, there are others made of blends, and the label of the garment might read, for example, \"40% nylon, 35% rayon, 25% polyester\". Nylon slips are often shiny in appearance, and are very smooth to the touch, while polyester slips can even be more shiny with a real slippery feel, especially charmeuse or \"satin\" slips. Although charmeuse slips have very attractive eye appeal, they are not as durable as nylon slips, and often tear very easily, especially when wet.\n\nSlips made in the 1940s were mainly made of 100% rayon due to the war effort. In the late 1940s, some nylon slips began to appear on the market, and the vast majority of slips made in the 1950s were nylon. In the 1960s, slips were offered in a much more variety of colours, including multi-coloured slips. Slips with a floral print design were also made available. Some of the most well known slip brand names of the past are: Lorraine, Dior, Velrose, Mel-Lin, Shadowline, Wonder Maid, Warner's, Kayser, Maidenform and Van Raalte. There are well established slip/lingerie manufacturers still in operation today such as Vanity Fair, Vassarette, and Sliperfection.\n\nMost of the slips made today are very plain, and are lacking in detail. Intricate decorations and lace designs are almost completely absent from modern day slips. Slips are not worn nearly as much as a few decades ago. Most transparent skirts and dresses now come with a lining, thus rendering slips redundant. Since the late 20th century, dresses closely based on slips have become very popular.\n\nThe word \"slip\" has come to be used to refer to a number of other undergarments. In German, French, and Italian the word “slip“ is commonly used for panties. (This is a false friend, as is the use of \"le smoking\" to describe a tuxedo jacket.) \"Slip\" is also sometimes used for the brief style of men's underwear. In the incontinence product market, the word \"slip\" is often used as a euphemism for an adult diaper or nappy, typically the \"all-in-one\" style that is worn by fastening on with adhesive tapes, similar to a larger version of the disposable ones worn by babies.\n\n"}

From October 1863 to August 1864 he was the leader of the insurrection. He headed the Polish national government from 17 October 1863 to 20 April 1864, and was president of its Foreign Affairs Office.\n\nBefore the uprising he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Russian army, where he won distinction in the Crimean War. He retired from the army in 1862 and became involved with Polish nationalists. After leading a partisan unit in the initial rebellion, he became leader of the rebel forces in October 1863.\n\nAfter the uprising failed, Traugutt was betrayed by Artur Goldman and sentenced to death by the Russian court. He was hanged near the Warsaw Citadel on 5 August 1864, aged 38, together with the rebel commanders Rafał Krajewski, Józef Toczyski, Roman Żuliński and Jan Jeziorański. The Roman Catholic Church is considering his beatification due to his overwhelming devotion to God and sacrifice for his homeland Poland. One of his early biographers has been the Marian Father, Józef Jarzębowski (1897-1964), who devoted three volumes to Traugutt's life and work.\n\nIn 1916, a monument was raised in Warsaw on the site of his execution, and in 1925, the area around it was dedicated as Traugutt Park.\n\nIn 1945, he was honored on the first postage stamp of the newly re-emerged Republic of Poland as part of a three-stamp set honoring national heroes. He had been earlier honored on a stamp in the 1938 set for the 20th anniversary of Poland’s independence after World War I. Poland issued additional stamps in his honor in 1962 and 1963. He was also commemorated on the Polish 20 złoty banknote of the 1980s.\n\nThe high school in Częstochowa is named after him, and a memorial column to him was erected in 1933 in Ciechocinek.\n\n\n"}

It was located at the capital, Gaegyeong (modern-day Kaesong), and provided advanced training in the Chinese classics. It was established in 992 during the reign of Seongjong. Its name has been changed to Songgyungam in 1298 and to Songgyungwan in 1308. Its current name is Koryo (/Goryeo) Songgyungwan University/University of Light Industry. A similar institution, known as the \"Gukhak\", had been established under Unified Silla, but it was not successful.\n\nThe Gukjagam was part of Seongjong's general program of Confucian reform, together with the \"gwageo\" civil service examinations and the \"hyanggyo\" provincial schools. It formed the cornerstone of the Confucian educational system he envisioned. In the waning days of Goryeo, the Gukjagam again became a centerpiece of reform through the policies of the early Neo-Confucian scholar An Hyang.\n\nIn the beginning, the Gukjagam provided a total of six courses of study. Of these, three divisions were restricted to children of the highest-ranking officials: Gukjahak, Taehak, and Samunhak. These were a total of nine years long, and focused on the Confucian classics.\n\nThe other three divisions were open to children of officials as low as the 8th rank: Seohak (secretarial training), Sanhak (arithmetic), and Yulhak (law). Each of these took six years to complete, and focused on technical training with a heavy admixture of the classics.\n\nA seventh division was added in 1104, in the reign of Yejong: Gangyejae (강예재), providing military training. This was the first recorded occasion of a Korean dynasty providing formal training in the military arts. Due to tensions between the aristocracy and the military, it was soon removed from the curriculum, in 1133.\n\nSeongjong's original edict of 992 provided land and slaves to support the school. However, the tuition remained prohibitive for most students not from wealthy families. In 1304, An Hyang levied a new tax which officials of the top 6 ranks had to pay in silver, and those of the lower ranks in cloth. This tax was used to defray the cost of tuition for the Gukjagam's students.\n\nThe name was changed to Gukhak in 1275, upon the ascension of King Chungnyeol. It was changed to Seonggyungam in 1298 and to Seonggyungwan in 1308, but then reverted to Gukjagam during the reign of Gongmin in 1358. The Seonggyungwan name was adopted again in 1362, and continued in use until the fall of Goryeo thirty years later.\n\n\n"}

Schools for the young have historically been supplemented with advanced training for priests, bureaucrats and specialists.\n\nStarting in about 3500 B.C., various writing systems developed in ancient civilizations around the world. In Egypt fully developed hieroglyphs were in use at Abydos as early as 3400 B.C. The oldest known alphabet was developed in central Egypt around 2000 B.C. from a hieroglyphic prototype. One hieroglyphic script was used on stone monuments, other cursive scripts were used for writing in ink on papyrus, a flexible, paper-like material, made from the stems of reeds that grow in marshes and beside rivers such as the River Nile.\n\nThe Phoenician writing system was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script in around the 11th century BC, which in turn borrowed ideas from Egyptian hieroglyphics. This script was adapted by the Greeks. A variant of the early Greek alphabet gave rise to the Etruscan alphabet, and its own descendants, such as the Latin alphabet. Other descendants from the Greek alphabet include the Cyrillic script, used to write Russian, among others.\n\nThe Phoenician system was also adapted into the Aramaic script, from which the Hebrew script and also that of Arabic are descended.\n\nIn China, the early oracle bone script has survived on tens of thousands of oracle bones dating from around 1400-1200 B.C. in the Shang Dynasty. Out of more than 2500 written characters in use in China in about 1200 BC, as many as 1400 are identifiable as the source of later standard Chinese characters.\n\nOf several pre-Columbian scripts in Mesoamerica, the one that appears to have been best developed, and the one to be deciphered the most, is the Maya script. The earliest inscriptions which are identifiably Maya date to the 3rd century B.C., and writing was in continuous use until shortly after the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century. In Chinese civilization, in school the children were not allowed to scribble. They were not to write slanted or sloppy characters.\n\nOther surfaces used for early writing include wax-covered writing boards (used, as well as clay tablets, by the Assyrians), sheets or strips of bark from trees (in Indonesia, Tibet and the Americas), the thick palm-like leaves of a particular tree, the leaves then punctured with a hole and stacked together like the pages of a book (these writings in India and South east Asia include Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit literature), parchment, made of goatskin that had been soaked and scraped to remove hair, which was used from at least the 2nd century B.C., vellum, made from calfskin, and wax tablets which could be wiped clean to provide a fresh surface (in the Roman times).\n\nPerhaps the earliest formal school was developed in Egypt's Middle Kingdom under the direction of Kheti, treasurer to Mentuhotep II.\nIn what became Mesopotamia, the early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its reading and writing. Only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals such as scribes, physicians, and temple administrators, were schooled. Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed to learn a trade. Girls stayed at home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children. Later, when a syllabic script became more widespread, more of the Mesopotamian population became literate. Later still in Babylonian times there were libraries in most towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred that \"he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn.\" There arose a whole social class of scribes, mostly employed in agriculture, but some as personal secretaries or lawyers. Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Ancient Mesopotamia is among the earliest known works of literary fiction. The earliest Sumerian versions of the epic date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (2150–2000 BC) (Dalley 1989: 41–42).\n\nAshurbanipal (685 – c. 627 BC), a king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, was proud of his scribal education. His youthful scholarly pursuits included oil divination, mathematics, reading and writing as well as the usual horsemanship, hunting, chariotry, soldierliness, craftsmanship, and royal decorum. During his reign he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, and especially Babylonia, in the library in Nineveh, the first systematically organized library in the ancient Middle East, which survives in part today.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribes. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status. The rate of literacy in Pharaonic Egypt during most periods from the third to first millennium BC has been estimated at not more than one percent, or between one half of one percent and one percent.\n\nIn ancient Israel, the Torah (the fundamental religious text) includes commands to read, learn, teach and write the Torah, thus requiring literacy and study. In 64 AD the high priest caused schools to be opened. Emphasis was placed on developing good memory skills in addition to comprehension oral repetition. For details of the subjects taught, see History of education in ancient Israel and Judah. Although girls were not provided with formal education in the yeshivah, they were required to know a large part of the subject areas to prepare them to maintain the home after marriage, and to educate the children before the age of seven. Despite this schooling system, it would seem that many children did not learn to read and write, because it has been estimated that \"at least ninety percent of the Jewish population of Roman Palestine [in the first centuries AD] could merely write their own name or not write and read at all\", or that the literacy rate was about 3 percent.\n\nIn the Islamic civilization that spread all the way between China and Spain during the time between the 7th and 19th centuries, Muslims started schooling from 622 in Medina, which is now a city in Saudi Arabia, schooling at first was in the mosques (masjid in Arabic) but then schools became separate in schools next to mosques. The first separate school was the Nizamiyah school. It was built in 1066 in Baghdad. Children started school from the age of six with free tuition. The teaches of Quran (the holy book of Muslims) claims that Muslims should learn to read, write and explore the universe. Thus, education and schooling sprang up in the ancient Muslim societies. Moreover, Muslims had one of the first universities in history which is Al-Qarawiyin University in Fez, Morocco. It was originally a mosque that was built in 859.\n\nIn ancient India, education was mainly imparted through the Vedic and Buddhist education system. Sanskrit was the language used to impart the Vedic education system. Pali was the language used in the Buddhist education system. In the Vedic system, a child started his education at the age of five, whereas in the Buddhist system the child started his education at the age of eight. The main aim of education in ancient India was to develop a person’s character, master the art of self-control, bring about social awareness, and to conserve and take forward ancient culture.\n\nThe Buddhist and Vedic systems had different subjects. In the Vedic system of study, the students were taught the four Vedas – Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda, they were also taught the six Vedangas – ritualistic knowledge, metrics, exegetics, grammar, phonetics and astronomy, the Upanishads and more.\n\nIn ancient India, education was imparted and passed on orally rather than in written form. Education was a process that involved three steps, first was ‘Sravana’ which is the acquisition of knowledge by listening to the Shrutis. The second is ‘Manana’ wherein the students think, analyze and make inferences. Third, is ‘Nidyasana’ in which the students apply the knowledge in their real life.\n\nDuring the Vedic period from about 1500 BC to 600 BC, most education was based on the Veda (hymns, formulas, and incantations, recited or chanted by priests of a pre-Hindu tradition) and later Hindu texts and scriptures. The main aim of education, according to the Vedas, is liberation.\n\nVedic education included proper pronunciation and recitation of the Veda, the rules of sacrifice, grammar and derivation, composition, versification and meter, understanding of secrets of nature, reasoning including logic, the sciences, and the skills necessary for an occupation. Some medical knowledge existed and was taught. There is mention in the Veda of herbal medicines for various conditions or diseases, including fever, cough, baldness, snake bite and others.\n\nEducation, at first freely available in Vedic society, became over time more rigid and restricted as the social systems dictated that only those of meritorious lineage be allowed to study the scriptures, originally based on occupation, evolved, with the Brahman (priests) being the most privileged of the castes, followed by Kshatriya who could also wear the sacred thread and gain access to Vedic education. The Brahmans were given priority even over Kshatriya as they would dedicate their whole lives to such studies.\n\nEducating the women was given a great deal of importance in ancient India. Women were trained in dance, music and housekeeping. The \"Sadyodwahas\" class of women got educated till they were married. The \"Brahmavadinis\" class of women never got married and educated themselves for their entire life. Parts of Vedas that included poems and religious songs required for rituals were taught to women. Some noteworthy women scholars of ancient India include Ghosha, Gargi, Indrani and so on.\n\nThe oldest of the Upanishads – another part of Hindu scriptures – date from around 500 BC. The Upanishads are considered as ‘wisdom teachings’ as they explore the deeper and actual meaning of sacrifice. These texts encouraged an exploratory learning process where teachers and students were co-travellers in a search for truth. The teaching methods used reasoning and questioning. Nothing was labeled as the final answer.\n\nThe Gurukula system of education supported traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery.In the Gurukul system, the teacher (Guru) and the student (Śiṣya) were considered to be equal even if they belonged to different social standings. Education was free, but students from well-to-do families paid \"Gurudakshina,\" a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. Gurudakshina is a mark of respect by the students towards their Guru. It is a way in which the students acknowledged, thanked and respected their Guru, whom they consider to be their spiritual guide. At the Gurukulas, the teacher imparted knowledge of Religion, Scriptures, Philosophy, Literature, Warfare, Statecraft, Medicine, Astrology and History. The corpus of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and drama as well as technical scientific, philosophical and generally Hindu religious texts, though many central texts of Buddhism and Jainism have also been composed in Sanskrit.\n\nTwo epic poems formed part of ancient Indian education. The Mahabharata, part of which may date back to the 8th century BC, discusses human goals (purpose, pleasure, duty, and liberation), attempting to explain the relationship of the individual to society and the world (the nature of the 'Self') and the workings of karma. The other epic poem, Ramayana, is shorter, although it has 24,000 verses. It is thought to have been compiled between about 400 BC and 200 AD. The epic explores themes of human existence and the concept of dharma (doing ones duty).\n\nIn the Buddhist education system, the subjects included Pitakas.\n\nIt is a Buddhist cannon that contains the set of rules and regulations that govern the Buddhist community residing in the Monastery.\n\nIt is divided into 5 \"niyakas\" (collections). It contains Buddhas teachings recorded mainly as sermons and.\n\nIt contains a summary and analysis of Buddha’s teachings.\n\nAn early centre of learning in India dating back to the 5th century BC was Taxila (also known as Takshashila), which taught the three Vedas and the eighteen accomplishments. It was an important Vedic/Hindu and Buddhist centre of learning from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD.'Another important centre of learning from 5th century CE , was Nalanda. In the kingdom of Magadha, Nalanda was well known Buddhist monastery. Scholars and students from Tibet, China, Korea and Central Asia traveled to Nalanda in pursuit of education. Vikramashila was one of the largest Buddhist monasteries that was set up in 8th to 9th centuries.\n\nThe start of Chinese education was raised in Yao dynasty (2188–2067 BC). In Yao dynasty, people started to educate their children to respect their parents, brothers and counties.\n\nThe first education system was created in Xia dynasty (2076–1600 BC). During Xia dynasty, government built schools to educate aristocrats about rituals, literature and archery (important for ancient Chinese aristocrats).\n\nDuring Shang dynasty (1600 BC to 1046 BC), normal people (farmers, workers etc.) accepted rough education. In that time, aristocrats' children studied in government schools. And normal people studied in private schools. Government schools were always built in cities and private schools were built in rural areas. Government schools paid attention on educating students about rituals, literature, politic, music, arts and archery. Private schools educated students to do farmwork and handworks.\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BC), there were five national schools in the capital city, Pi Yong (an imperial school, located in a central location) and four other schools for the aristocrats and nobility, including Shang Xiang. The schools mainly taught the Six Arts: rites, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics. According to the Book of Rites, at age twelve, boys learned arts related to ritual (i.e. music and dance) and when older, archery and chariot driving. Girls learned ritual, correct deportment, silk production and weaving.\n\nIt was during the Zhou dynasty that the origins of native Chinese philosophy also developed. Confucius (551–479 BC) founder of Confucianism, was a Chinese philosopher who made a great impact on later generations of Chinese, and on the curriculum of the Chinese educational system for much of the following 2000 years.\n\nLater, during the Qin dynasty (246–207 BC), a hierarchy of officials was set up to provide central control over the outlying areas of the empire. To enter this hierarchy, both literacy and knowledge of the increasing body of philosophy was required: \"...the content of the educational process was designed not to engender functionally specific skills but rather to produce morally enlightened and cultivated generalists\".\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206–221 AD), boys were thought ready at age seven to start learning basic skills in reading, writing and calculation. In 124 BC, the Emperor Wudi established the Imperial Academy, the curriculum of which was the Five Classics of Confucius. By the end of the Han dynasty (220 AD) the academy enrolled more than 30,000 students, boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years. However education through this period was a luxury.\n\nThe nine-rank system was a civil service nomination system during the Three Kingdoms (220–280 AD) and the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589 AD) in China. Theoretically, local government authorities were given the task of selecting talented candidates, then categorizing them into nine grades depending on their abilities. In practice, however, only the rich and powerful would be selected. The Nine Rank System was eventually superseded by the Imperial examination system for the civil service in the Sui dynasty (581–618 AD)\n\nIn the city-states of ancient Greece, most education was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling. Anyone could open a school and decide the curriculum. Parents could choose a school offering the subjects they wanted their children to learn, at a monthly fee they could afford. Most parents, even the poor, sent their sons to schools for at least a few years, and if they could afford it from around the age of seven until fourteen, learning gymnastics (including athletics, sport and wrestling), music (including poetry, drama and history) and literacy. Girls rarely received formal education. At writing school, the youngest students learned the alphabet by song, then later by copying the shapes of letters with a stylus on a waxed wooden tablet. After some schooling, the sons of poor or middle-class families often learnt a trade by apprenticeship, whether with their father or another tradesman. By around 350 BC, it was common for children at schools in Athens to also study various arts such as drawing, painting, and sculpture. The richest students continued their education by studying with sophists, from whom they could learn subjects such as rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic. Some of Athens' greatest schools of higher education included the Lyceum (the so-called Peripatetic school founded by Aristotle of Stageira) and the Platonic Academy (founded by Plato of Athens). The education system of the wealthy ancient Greeks is also called Paideia. In the subsequent Roman empire, Greek was the primary language of science. Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the Hellenistic side of the Roman empire, in Greek.\n\nThe education system in the Greek city-state of Sparta was entirely different, designed to create warriors with complete obedience, courage, and physical perfection. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from their homes to live in school dormitories or military barracks. There they were taught sports, endurance and fighting, and little else, with harsh discipline. Most of the population was illiterate.\n\nThe first schools in Ancient Rome arose by the middle of the 4th century BC. These schools were concerned with the basic socialization and rudimentary education of young Roman children. The literacy rate in the 3rd century BC has been estimated as around one percent to two percent. There are very few primary sources or accounts of Roman educational process until the 2nd century BC, during which there was a proliferation of private schools in Rome. At the height of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, the Roman educational system gradually found its final form. Formal schools were established, which served paying students (very little in the way of free public education as we know it can be found). Normally, both boys and girls were educated, though not necessarily together. In a system much like the one that predominates in the modern world, the Roman education system that developed arranged schools in tiers. The educator Quintilian recognized the importance of starting education as early as possible, noting that \"memory … not only exists even in small children, but is specially retentive at that age\". A Roman student would progress through schools just as a student today might go from elementary school to middle school, then to high school, and finally college. Progression depended more on ability than age with great emphasis being placed upon a student's \"ingenium\" or inborn \"gift\" for learning, and a more tacit emphasis on a student's ability to afford high-level education. Only the Roman elite would expect a complete formal education. A tradesman or farmer would expect to pick up most of his vocational skills on the job. Higher education in Rome was more of a status symbol than a practical concern.\n\nLiteracy rates in the Greco-Roman world were seldom more than 20 percent; averaging perhaps not much above 10 percent in the Roman empire, though with wide regional variations, probably never rising above 5 percent in the western provinces. The literate in classical Greece did not much exceed 5 percent of the population.\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, the monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church were the centers of education and literacy, preserving the Church's selection from Latin learning and maintaining the art of writing. Prior to their formal establishment, many medieval universities were run for hundreds of years as Christian monastic schools (\"Scholae monasticae\"), in which monks taught classes, and later as cathedral schools; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the early 6th century.\n\nThe first medieval institutions generally considered to be universities were established in Italy, France, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology.[1] These universities evolved from much older Christian cathedral schools and monastic schools, and it is difficult to define the date on which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe held by the Vatican are a useful guide.\n\nStudents in the twelfth-century were very proud of the master whom they studied under. They were not very concerned with telling others the place or region where they received their education. Even now when scholars cite schools with distinctive doctrines, they use group names to describe the school rather than its geographical location. Those who studied under Robert of Melun were called the \"Meludinenses\". These people did not study in Melun, but in Paris, and were given the group name of their master. Citizens in the twelfth-century became very interested in learning the rare and difficult skills masters could provide.\n\nIreland became known as the island of saints and scholars. Monasteries were built all over Ireland, and these became centres of great learning (see Celtic Church).\n\nNorthumbria was famed as a centre of religious learning and arts. Initially the kingdom was evangelized by monks from the Celtic Church, which led to a flowering of monastic life, and Northumbria played an important role in the formation of Insular art, a unique style combining Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Byzantine and other elements. After the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD, Roman church practices officially replaced the Celtic ones but the influence of the Anglo-Celtic style continued, the most famous examples of this being the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Venerable Bede (673–735) wrote his \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" (Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731) in a Northumbrian monastery, and much of it focuses on the kingdom.\n\nDuring the reign of Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 to 814 AD, whose empire united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Romans, there was a flowering of literature, art, and architecture known as the Carolingian Renaissance. Brought into contact with the culture and learning of other countries through his vast conquests, Charlemagne greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia. Most of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars.\n\nCharlemagne took a serious interest in scholarship, promoting the liberal arts at the court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself under the tutelage of Paul the Deacon, from whom he learned grammar, Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialect and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars), and Einhard, who assisted him in his studies of arithmetic. The English monk Alcuin was invited to Charlemagne's court at Aachen, and brought with him the precise classical Latin education that was available in the monasteries of Northumbria. The return of this Latin proficiency to the kingdom of the Franks is regarded as an important step in the development of mediaeval Latin. Charlemagne's chancery made use of a type of script currently known as Carolingian minuscule, providing a common writing style that allowed for communication across most of Europe. After the decline of the Carolingian dynasty, the rise of the Saxon Dynasty in Germany was accompanied by the Ottonian Renaissance.\nCathedral schools and monasteries remained important throughout the Middle Ages; at the Third Lateran Council of 1179 the Church mandated that priests provide the opportunity of a free education to their flocks, and the 12th and 13th century renascence known as the Scholastic Movement was spread through the monasteries. These however ceased to be the sole sources of education in the 11th century when universities, which grew out of the monasticism began to be established in major European cities. Literacy became available to a wider class of people, and there were major advances in art, sculpture, music and architecture.\n\nIn 1120, Dunfermline Abbey in Scotland by order of Malcolm Canmore and his Queen, Margaret, built and established the first high school in the UK, Dunfermline High School. This highlighted the monastery influence and developments made for education, from the ancient capital of Scotland.\n\nSculpture, paintings and stained glass windows were vital educational media through which Biblical themes and the lives of the saints were taught to illiterate viewers.\n\nDuring the 6th and 7th centuries, the Academy of Gundishapur, originally the intellectual center of the Sassanid empire and subsequently a Muslim centre of learning, offered training in medicine, philosophy, theology and science. The faculty were versed not only in the Zoroastrian and Persian traditions, but in Greek and Indian learning as well.\n\nThe University of al-Qarawiyyin located in Fes, Morocco is the oldest existing, continually operating and the first degree awarding educational institution in the world according to UNESCO and Guinness World Records and is sometimes referred to as the oldest university.\n\nThe House of Wisdom in Baghdad was a library, translation and educational centre from the 9th to 13th centuries. Works on astrology, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and philosophy were translated. Drawing on Persian, Indian and Greek texts—including those of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta—the scholars accumulated a great collection of knowledge in the world, and built on it through their own discoveries. The House was an unrivalled centre for the study of humanities and for sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology and geography. Baghdad was known as the world's richest city and centre for intellectual development of the time, and had a population of over a million, the largest in its time.\n\nThe Islamic mosque school (Madrasah) taught the Quran in Arabic and did not at all resemble the medieval European universities.\n\nIn the 9th century, Bimaristan medical schools were formed in the medieval Islamic world, where medical diplomas were issued to students of Islamic medicine who were qualified to be a practicing Doctor of Medicine. Al-Azhar University, founded in Cairo, Egypt in 975, was a \"Jami'ah\" (\"university\" in Arabic) which offered a variety of post-graduate degrees, had a Madrasah and theological seminary, and taught Islamic law, Islamic jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy and logic in Islamic philosophy.\n\nUnder the Ottoman Empire, the towns of Bursa and Edirne became major centers of learning.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the town of Timbuktu in the West African nation of Mali became an Islamic centre of learning with students coming from as far away as the Middle East. The town was home to the prestigious Sankore University and other madrasas. The primary focus of these schools was the teaching of the Qur'an, although broader instruction in fields such as logic, astronomy, and history also took place. Over time, there was a great accumulation of manuscripts in the area and an estimated 100,000 or more manuscripts, some of them dated from pre-Islamic times and 12th century, are kept by the great families from the town. Their contents are didactic, especially in the subjects of astronomy, music, and botany. More than 18,000 manuscripts have been collected by the Ahmed Baba centre.\n\nAlthough there are more than 40,000 Chinese characters in written Chinese, many are rarely used. Studies have shown that full literacy in the Chinese language requires a knowledge of only between three and four thousand characters.\n\nIn China, three oral texts were used to teach children by rote memorization the written characters of their language and the basics of Confucian thought.\n\nThe Thousand Character Classic, a Chinese poem originating in the 6th century, was used for more than a millennium as a primer for teaching Chinese characters to children. The poem is composed of 250 phrases of four characters each, thus containing exactly one thousand unique characters, and was sung in the same way that children learning the Latin alphabet may use the \"alphabet song\".\n\nLater, children also learn the Hundred Family Surnames, a rhyming poem in lines of eight characters composed in the early Song dynasty (i.e. in about the 11th century) which actually listed more than four hundred of the common surnames in ancient China.\n\nFrom around the 13th century until the latter part of the 19th century, the Three Character Classic, which is an embodiment of Confucian thought suitable for teaching to young children, served as a child's first formal education at home. The text is written in triplets of characters for easy memorization. With illiteracy common for most people at the time, the oral tradition of reciting the classic ensured its popularity and survival through the centuries. With the short and simple text arranged in three-character verses, children learned many common characters, grammar structures, elements of Chinese history and the basis of Confucian morality.\n\nAfter learning Chinese characters, students wishing to ascend in the social hierarchy needed to study the Chinese classic texts.\n\nThe early Chinese state depended upon literate, educated officials for operation of the empire. In 605 AD, during the Sui dynasty, for the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. The merit-based imperial examination system for evaluating and selecting officials gave rise to schools that taught the Chinese classic texts and continued in use for 1,300 years, until the end the Qing dynasty, being abolished in 1911 in favour of Western education methods. The core of the curriculum for the imperial civil service examinations from the mid-12th century onwards was the Four Books, representing a foundational introduction to Confucianism.\n\nTheoretically, any male adult in China, regardless of his wealth or social status, could become a high-ranking government official by passing the imperial examination, although under some dynasties members of the merchant class were excluded. In reality, since the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly (if tutors were hired), most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning gentry. However, there are vast numbers of examples in Chinese history in which individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Under some dynasties the imperial examinations were abolished and official posts were simply sold, which increased corruption and reduced morale.\n\nIn the period preceding 1040–1050 AD, prefectural schools had been neglected by the state and left to the devices of wealthy patrons who provided private finances. The chancellor of China at that time, Fan Zhongyan, issued an edict that would have used a combination of government funding and private financing to restore and rebuild all prefectural schools that had fallen into disuse and abandoned. He also attempted to restore all county-level schools in the same manner, but did not designate where funds for the effort would be formally acquired and the decree was not taken seriously until a later period. Fan's trend of government funding for education set in motion the movement of public schools that eclipsed private academies, which would not be officially reversed until the mid-13th century.\n\nThe first millennium and the few centuries preceding it saw the flourishing of higher education at Nalanda, Takshashila University, Ujjain, & Vikramshila Universities. Amongst the subjects taught were Art, Architecture, Painting, Logic, mathematics, Grammar, Philosophy, Astronomy, Literature, Buddhism, Hinduism, Arthashastra (Economics & Politics), Law, and Medicine. Each university specialized in a particular field of study. Takshila specialized in the study of medicine, while Ujjain laid emphasis on astronomy. Nalanda, being the biggest centre, handled all branches of knowledge, and housed up to 10,000 students at its peak.\n\nVikramashila Mahavihara, another important center of Buddhist learning in India, was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at Nālandā.\n\n\"Hindu education :-\"\n\nEven during the middle ages, education in India was imparted orally. Education was provided to the individuals free of cost. It was considered holy and honorable to do so. The ruling king did not provide any funds for education but it was the people belonging to the Hindu religion who donated for the preservation of the Hindu education. The centres of Hindu learning, which were the universities, were set up in places where the scholars resided. These places also became places of pilgrimage. So, more and more pilgrims funded these institutions.\n\n\"Islamic education :-\"\n\nAfter Muslims started ruling India, there was a rise in the spread of Islamic education. The main aim of Islamic education included the acquisition of knowledge, propagation of Islam and Islamic social morals, preservation and spread of Muslim culture etc. Educations was mainly imparted through Maqtabs, Madrassahas and Mosques. Their education was usually funded by the noble or the landlords. The education was imparted orally and the children learnt a few verses from the Quran by rote.\n\nIndigenous education was widespread in India in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students representative of all classes of society.\n\nThe history of education in Japan dates back at least to the 6th century, when Chinese learning was introduced at the Yamato court. Foreign civilizations have often provided new ideas for the development of Japan's own culture.\n\nChinese teachings and ideas flowed into Japan from the sixth to the 9th century. Along with the introduction of Buddhism came the Chinese system of writing and its literary tradition, and Confucianism.\n\nBy the 9th century, Heian-kyō (today's Kyoto), the imperial capital, had five institutions of higher learning, and during the remainder of the Heian period, other schools were established by the nobility and the imperial court. During the medieval period (1185–1600), Zen Buddhist monasteries were especially important centers of learning, and the Ashikaga School, Ashikaga Gakko, flourished in the 15th century as a center of higher learning.\n\nAztec is a term used to refer to certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who achieved political and military dominance over large parts of Mesoamerica in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period referred to as the Late post-Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology.\n\nUntil the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their \"calpōlli\". Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called \"huēhuetlàtolli\" (\"sayings of the old\"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. Judged by their language, most of the \"huēhuetlàtolli\" seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.\n\nAt 15, all boys and girls went to school. The Mexica, one of the Aztec groups, were one of the first people in the world to have mandatory education for nearly all children, regardless of gender, rank, or station. There were two types of schools: the \"telpochcalli\", for practical and military studies, and the \"calmecac\", for advanced learning in writing, astronomy, statesmanship, theology, and other areas. The two institutions seem to be common to the Nahua people, leading some experts to suggest that they are older than the Aztec culture.\n\nAztec teachers (\"tlatimine\") propounded a spartan regime of education with the purpose of forming a stoical people.\n\nGirls were educated in the crafts of home and child raising. They were not taught to read or write. All women were taught to be involved in religion; there are paintings of women presiding over religious ceremonies, but there are no references to female priests.\n\nInca education during the time of the Inca Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries was divided into two principal spheres: education for the upper classes and education for the general population. The royal classes and a few specially chosen individuals from the provinces of the Empire were formally educated by the Amautas (wise men), while the general population learned knowledge and skills from their immediate forebears.\n\nThe Amautas constituted a special class of wise men similar to the bards of Great Britain. They included illustrious philosophers, poets, and priests who kept the oral histories of the Incas alive by imparting the knowledge of their culture, history, customs and traditions throughout the kingdom. Considered the most highly educated and respected men in the Empire, the Amautas were largely entrusted with educating those of royal blood, as well as other young members of conquered cultures specially chosen to administer the regions. Thus, education throughout the territories of the Incas was socially discriminatory, most people not receiving the formal education that royalty received.\n\nThe official language of the empire was Quechua, although dozens if not hundreds of local languages were spoken. The Amautas did ensure that the general population learn Quechua as the language of the Empire, much in the same way the Romans promoted Latin throughout Europe; however, this was done more for political reasons than educational ones...\n\nModern systems of education in Europe derive their origins from the schools of the High Middle Ages. Most schools during this era were founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy. Many of the earliest universities, such as the University of Paris founded in 1160, had a Christian basis. In addition to this, a number of secular universities existed, such as the University of Bologna, founded in 1088. Free education for the poor was officially mandated by the Church in 1179 when it decreed that every cathedral must assign a master to teach boys too poor to pay the regular fee; parishes and monasteries also established free schools teaching at least basic literary skills. With few exceptions, priests and brothers taught locally, and their salaries were frequently subsidized by towns. Private, independent schools reappeared in medieval Europe during this time, but they, too, were religious in nature and mission. The curriculum was usually based around the trivium and to a lesser extent quadrivium (the seven Artes Liberales or Liberal arts) and was conducted in Latin, the lingua franca of educated Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n\nIn northern Europe this clerical education was largely superseded by forms of elementary schooling following the Reformation. In Scotland, for instance, the national Church of Scotland set out a programme for spiritual reform in January 1561 setting the principle of a school teacher for every parish church and free education for the poor. This was provided for by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland, passed in 1633, which introduced a tax to pay for this programme. Although few countries of the period had such extensive systems of education, the period between the 16th and 18th centuries saw education become significantly more widespread.\n\nHerbart developed a system of pedagogy widely used in German-speaking areas.\nMass compulsory schooling started in Prussia c1800 to \"produce more soldiers and more obedient citizens\"\n\nIn Central Europe, the 17th century scientist and educator John Amos Comenius promulgated a reformed system of universal education that was widely used in Europe.\nIts growth resulted in increased government interest in education. In the 1760s, for instance, Ivan Betskoy was appointed by the Russian Tsarina, Catherine II, as educational advisor. He proposed to educate young Russians of both sexes in state boarding schools, aimed at creating \"a new race of men\". Betskoy set forth a number of arguments for general education of children rather than specialized one: \"in regenerating our subjects by an education founded on these principles, we will create... new citizens.\" Some of his ideas were implemented in the Smolny Institute that he established for noble girls in Saint Petersburg.\n\nPoland established in 1773 of a Commission of National Education (Polish: \"Komisja Edukacji Narodowej\", Lithuanian: \"Nacionaline Edukacine Komisija\"). The commission functioned as the first government Ministry of Education in a European country.\n\nBy the 18th century, universities published academic journals; by the 19th century, the German and the French university models were established. The French established the Ecole Polytechnique in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution, and it became a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804. The German university — the Humboldtian model — established by Wilhelm von Humboldt was based upon Friedrich Schleiermacher’s liberal ideas about the importance of seminars, and laboratories. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the universities concentrated upon science, and served an upper class clientele. Science, mathematics, theology, philosophy, and ancient history comprised the typical curriculum.\n\nIncreasing academic interest in education led to analysis of teaching methods and in the 1770s the establishment of the first chair of pedagogy at the University of Halle in Germany. Contributions to the study of education elsewhere in Europe included the work of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in Switzerland and Joseph Lancaster in Britain.\n\nIn 1884, a groundbreaking education conference was held in London at the International Health Exhibition, attracting specialists from all over Europe.\n\nIn the late 19th century, most of West, Central, and parts of East Europe began to provide elementary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic, partly because politicians believed that education was needed for orderly political behavior. As more people became literate, they realized that most secondary education was only open to those who could afford it. Having created primary education, the major nations had to give further attention to secondary education by the time of World War I.\n\nIn the 20th century, new directions in education included, in Italy, Maria Montessori's Montessori schools; and in Germany, Rudolf Steiner's development of Waldorf education.\n\nIn the Ancien Régime before 1789, educational facilities and aspirations were becoming increasingly institutionalized primarily in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. France had many small local schools where working-class children — both boys and girls — learned to read, the better to know, love and serve God. The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites, however, were given quite distinct educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters perhaps were sent for finishing at a convent. The Enlightenment challenged this old ideal, but no real alternative presented itself for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.\n\nThe modern era of French education begins in the 1790s. The Revolution in the 1790s abolished the traditional universities. Napoleon sought to replace them with new institutions, the Polytechnique, focused on technology. The elementary schools received little attention until 1830, when France copied the Prussian education system.\n\nJules Ferry, an anti-clerical politician holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, created the modern Republican school (\"l'école républicaine\") by requiring all children under the age of 15—boys and girls—to attend. see Jules Ferry laws Schools were free of charge and secular (\"laïque\"). The goal was to break the hold of the Catholic Church and monarchism on young people. Catholic schools were still tolerated but in the early 20th century the religious orders sponsoring them were shut down.\n\nIn 1818, John Pounds set up a school and began teaching poor children reading, writing, and mathematics without charging fees. \nIn 1820, Samuel Wilderspin opened the first infant school in Spitalfield. Starting in 1833, Parliament voted money to support poor children's school fees in England and Wales.\nIn 1837, the Whig Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham led the way in preparing for public education. Most schooling was handled in church schools, and religious controversies between the Church of England And the dissenters became a central theme and educational history before 1900.\n\nScotland has a separate system. See History of education in Scotland.\n\nJapan isolated itself from the rest of the world in the year 1600 under the Tokugawa regime (1600–1867). In 1600 very few common people were literate. By the period's end, learning had become widespread. Tokugawa education left a valuable legacy: an increasingly literate populace, a meritocratic ideology, and an emphasis on discipline and competent performance. Traditional Samurai curricula for elites stressed morality and the martial arts. Confucian classics were memorized, and reading and recitation of them were common methods of study. Arithmetic and calligraphy were also studied. Education of commoners was generally practically oriented, providing basic 3-Rs, calligraphy and use of the abacus. Much of this education was conducted in so-called temple schools (terakoya), derived from earlier Buddhist schools. These schools were no longer religious institutions, nor were they, by 1867, predominantly located in temples. By the end of the Tokugawa period, there were more than 11,000 such schools, attended by 750,000 students. Teaching techniques included reading from various textbooks, memorizing, abacus, and repeatedly copying Chinese characters and Japanese script. By the 1860s, 40–50% of Japanese boys, and 15% of the girls, had some schooling outside the home. These rates were comparable to major European nations at the time (apart from Germany, which had compulsory schooling). Under subsequent Meiji leadership, this foundation would facilitate Japan's rapid transition from feudal society to modern nation which paid very close attention to Western science, technology and educational methods.\n\nAfter 1868 reformers set Japan on a rapid course of modernization, with a public education system like that of Western Europe. Missions like the Iwakura mission were sent abroad to study the education systems of leading Western countries. They returned with the ideas of decentralization, local school boards, and teacher autonomy. Elementary school enrollments climbed from about 40 or 50 percent of the school-age population in the 1870s to more than 90 percent by 1900, despite strong public protest, especially against school fees.\n\nA modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji era leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals – and children – in service of the state. The Western-style school became the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood. After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes\n\nAfter 1870 school textbooks based on Confucianism were replaced by westernized texts. However, by the 1890s, a reaction set in and a more authoritarian approach was imposed. Traditional Confucian and Shinto precepts were again stressed, especially those concerning the hierarchical nature of human relations, service to the new state, the pursuit of learning, and morality. These ideals, embodied in the 1890 Imperial Rescript on Education, along with highly centralized government control over education, largely guided Japanese education until 1945, when they were massively repudiated.\n\nEducation was widespread for elite young men in the 18th century, with schools in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.\n\nThe current system of education, with its western style and content, was introduced and founded by the British during the British Raj, following recommendations by Lord Macaulay, who advocated for the teaching of English in schools and the formation of a class of Anglicized Indian interpreters. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.\n\nPublic education expenditures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries varied dramatically across regions with the western and southern provinces spending three to four times as much as the eastern provinces. Much of the inter-regional differential was due to historical differences in land taxes, the major source of revenue.\n\nLord Curzon, the Viceroy 1899–1905, made mass education a high priority after finding that no more than 20% of India's children attended school. His reforms centered on literacy training and on restructuring of the university systems. They stressed ungraded curricula, modern textbooks, and new examination systems. Curzon's plans for technical education laid the foundations which were acted upon by later governments.\n\nShortly after Norway became an archdiocese in 1152, cathedral schools were constructed to educate priests in Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen and Hamar. After the reformation of Norway in 1537, (Norway entered a personal union with Denmark in 1536) the cathedral schools were turned into Latin schools, and it was made mandatory for all market towns to have such a school. In 1736 training in reading was made compulsory for all children, but was not effective until some years later. In 1827, Norway introduced the \"folkeskole\", a primary school which became mandatory for 7 years in 1889 and 9 years in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, the \"folkeskole\" was abolished, and the \"grunnskole\" was introduced.\n\nIn 1997, Norway established a new curriculum for elementary schools and middle schools. The plan is based on ideological nationalism, child-orientation, and community-orientation along with the effort to publish new ways of teaching.\n\nIn Canada, education became a contentious issue after Confederation in 1867, especially regarding the status of French schools outside Quebec.\n\nEducation in New Zealand began with provision made by the provincial government, the missionary Christian churches and private education. The first act of parliament for education was passed in 1877, and sought to establish a standard for primary education. It was compulsory for children to attend school from the age of 6 until the age of 16 years.\n\nIn Australia, compulsory education was enacted in the 1870s, and it was difficult to enforce. People found it hard to afford for school fees. Moreover, teachers felt that they did not get a high salary for what they did.\n\nIn Imperial Russia, according to the 1897 census, literate people made up 28 percent of the population. There was a strong network of universities for the upper class, but weaker provisions for everyone else.\n\nVladimir Lenin, in 1919 proclaimed the major aim of the Soviet government was the abolition of illiteracy. A system of universal compulsory education was established. Millions of illiterate adults were enrolled in special literacy schools. Youth groups (Komsomol members and Young Pioneer) were utilized to teach. In 1926, the literacy rate was 56.6 percent of the population. By 1937, according to census data, the literacy rate was 86% for men and 65% for women, making a total literacy rate of 75%.\n\nAn important aspect of the early campaign for literacy and education was the policy of \"indigenization\" (korenizatsiya). This policy, which lasted essentially from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s, promoted the development and use of non-Russian languages in the government, the media, and education. Intended to counter the historical practices of Russification, it had as another practical goal assuring native-language education as the quickest way to increase educational levels of future generations. A huge network of so-called \"national schools\" was established by the 1930s, and this network continued to grow in enrollments throughout the Soviet era. Language policy changed over time, perhaps marked first of all in the government's mandating in 1938 the teaching of Russian as a required \"subject\" of study in every non-Russian school, and then especially beginning in the latter 1950s a growing conversion of non-Russian schools to Russian as the main medium of instruction.\n\nEducation in French controlled West Africa during the late 1800s and early 1900s was different from the nationally uniform compulsory education of France in the 1880s. \"Adapted education\" was organized in 1903 and used the French curriculum as a basis, replacing information relevant to France with \"comparable information drawn from the African context.\" For example, French lessons of morality were coupled with many references to African history and local folklore. The French language was also taught as an integral part of adapted education.\n\nAfrica has more than 40 million children. According to UNESCO's \"Regional overview on sub-Saharan Africa\", in 2000 only 58% of children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region. The USAID Center reports as of 2005, forty percent of school-aged children in Africa do not attend primary school.\n\nToday, there is some form of compulsory education in most countries. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.\n\nIlliteracy and the percentage of populations without any schooling have decreased in the past several decades. For example, the percentage of population without any schooling decreased from 36% in 1960 to 25% in 2000.\n\nAmong developing countries, illiteracy and percentages without schooling in 2000 stood at about half the 1970 figures. Among developed countries, figures about illiteracy rates differ widely. Often it is said that they decreased from 6% to 1%. Illiteracy rates in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) surpassed those of more economically developed countries (MEDCs) by a factor of 10 in 1970, and by a factor of about 20 in 2000. Illiteracy decreased greatly in LEDCs, and virtually disappeared in MEDCs. Percentages without any schooling showed similar patterns.\n\nPercentages of the population with no schooling varied greatly among LEDCs in 2000, from less than 10% to over 65%. MEDCs had much less variation, ranging from less than 2% to 17%.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, societies around the globe have undergone an accelerating pace of change in economy and technology. Its effects on the workplace, and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the workforce, have been significant. Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing and increasingly digital workplace and society. 21st century skills are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies. Many of these skills are also associated with deeper learning, including analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork, compared to traditional knowledge-based academic skills.\n\nSummary: Global synchronization raised in the Renaissance and experienced three peaks of expansion: Colonial Era, The World War and After The Cold War. And global synchronization is still growing and processing nowadays. The linguistic obstacles, cultural dictatorship, inequality and cultural racisms have been eliminating from 500 years ago to today. Disappearance of those unfavorable factors has been promoting education become more and more globally.\n\nThe start: Renaissance\n\nBefore the Renaissance, education is focusing on art and ritual related with Christianity. And also Christianity controlled education system and decided who can accept education. During the Renaissance, education systems was changed. Many private schools were raised. Therefore, more and more people accepted education and people in Europe had opportunities to choose what they want to study. Arts and knowledges were spreading from the Florence to whole Europe. People in every corners of Europe spread their culture and thoughts to each others. Trades between different countries and regions raised more frequently in Europe. During business activities, languages, artworks and literatures from different culture groups mixed and influenced each others.\n\nFirst peak: Colonial Era\n\nDuring the Colonial Era, Education's global synchronization was promoted by three reasons: business, Suzerains' policy and weak countries' policies. Both three points make eductions in different regions to be assimilate. For business, business men come from suzerains rarely educated workers who come form colonies. For suzerains, suzerains educated people in colonies to speak suzerains' language and accepted suzerains' culture because suzerains want to assimilate native people in colonies (Make suzerains control colonies easily)(FE: What France did in its colonies). For weak countries, they imitated suzerains and studied how suzerain make themselves strong because they wanted to become strong countries and avoid fortunes which is becoming colonies . So weak countries educate citizens as how suzerains educated citizens and absorb suzerains' culture.\n\nSecond peak: World War\n\nDuring the world war, many people migrated to other countries for avoid wars. They brought their knowledge and culture to other countries and reshape other countries' culture and situation. It eliminated parts of globalizing education's obstacles: language and culture racism. Furthermore, refugees who studied in other countries came back to their own and spread knowledge and culture of the other countries after the end of war. It eliminated language obstacle and culture racism again.\n\nThird peak: The Cold War\n\nBefore the Cold War, countries formed two opposing groups. Trade and cultural communication were rarely happened between countries who stand in different groups. After the Cold War, most countries join in the globalization's system. Cultural communication raised more frequently between countries and each others. It has been eliminating globalizing education's obstacles( linguistic obstacles, inequality and cultural racisms) and make education in every countries to be assimilated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She most recently played for the Seattle Storm in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She is usually called by her nickname, \"Svet\" or \"Sveta\".\n\nAbrosimova was born in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (today St. Petersburg, Russia), to Oleg and Ludmilla Abrosimov. Her father Oleg works as a welder in a shipyard and her older sister, Tatiana, was a professional ballroom dancer. While attending school she was trained for the then Soviet Olympic team. She was named the MVP of the 1996 European Basketball Championship (also known as \"Eurobasket\"), averaging 18 points, six rebounds and three assists per game. She was also a member of all-star teams that won the 1995 and 1996 European Championship.\n\nAbrosimova was a member of the Russian national basketball team that placed sixth at the 2000 Summer Olympics and won a silver medal in the 1998 Basketball World Championship.\n\nIn her freshman season (1997-1998) at the University of Connecticut, Abrosimova's team went 28–2 in the regular season, losing only to Tennessee and Rutgers. The team went on to win the Big East Tournament, avenging the loss to Rutgers by beating Rutgers in the tournament championship. The team won their first three NCAA games, but Abrosimova was injured in the regional final against NC State, and the team lost, ending their season.\n\nAfter a standout collegiate career, which included an NCAA national collegiate title in 2000, Abrosimova was selected in the first round (seventh overall pick) by the Minnesota Lynx during the 2001 WNBA Draft despite a foot injury. She was a 3-time Kodak first team All-American while at UConn. Svetlana was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women's basketball \"Huskies of Honor\" recognition program.

The division was named after Charles Throsby, a prominent pioneer and explorer in the early nineteenth century of the areas to the south of Sydney.\n\nLocated in the Illawarra, the division covered eastern Wingecarribee Shire, extending from Exeter, Lake Yarrunga and Upper Kangaroo Valley in the south to Aylmerton, Alpine, the Avon Dam, Lake Avon, Dombarton, and Kembla Grange in the north to the Pacific Ocean in the east at Port Kembla, including the northern part of the City of Shellharbour and the southern portion of the adjacent City of Wollongong. Before its abolition, it included Albion Park, Berkeley, Berrima, Blackbutt, Bowral, Cringila, Dapto, Exeter, Fitzroy Falls, Horsley, Kembla Grange, Lake Illawarra, Mittagong, Moss Vale, Oak Flats, Port Kembla, Robertson, Warrawong, Welby, Willow Vale, and parts of Warilla.\n\nThe Division of Throsby was created in a redistribution in 1984 and had been represented by Labor since its inception. The Illawarra is one of the few non-metropolitan regions where Labor consistently does well. The area has a strong working-class character due to the presence of industries such as steelmaking, coal mining and stevedoring.\n\nIt was renamed the Division of Whitlam in 2016.\n\nIn honour of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, the Australian Electoral Commission announced in 2015 that it would rename the Division of Throsby as the Division of Whitlam, to take effect at the 2016 federal election.\n\nThere were two formally lodged objections for renaming Throsby to Whitlam on the basis that the former Prime Minister's connection with the Illawarra area, particularly in the seat of Throsby, is limited to non-existent, and that it would be better suited to rename Whitlam's old parliamentary seat of Werriwa in his honour. One of the objections lodged by a Councillor of Wollongong Council stated the matter was \"hotly debated in the Wollongong community since the announcement\" and that council had voted against supporting the proposed change.\n\nHowever, the change took effect on 25 February 2016.\n\n"}

Robinson and Lon McCallister. It is adapted from the 1945 novel \"The Red House\" by George Agnew Chamberlain.\n\nHandicapped farmer Pete Morgan (Edward G. Robinson) and sister Ellen (Judith Anderson) live on an isolated farm with their adopted daughter, Meg (Allene Roberts). They keep to themselves and are viewed as mysterious by the nearby town. Now a teenager, Meg convinces Pete to hire one of her 12th-grade high school classmates, Nath Storm (Lon McCallister), to come help with chores on the farm. On the first evening, when it is time for him to go home, Nath says he is going to take a shortcut through the old woods. The woods are part of Pete's property and he forbids anyone from entering them. Pete becomes agitated, insisting the woods are dangerous and contain a haunted house which is painted red, and that Nath must stay out.\n\nAfter traveling through the woods in the dark, Nath returns spooked, after hearing moans and yells. However, a few days later, he is embarrassed at his cowardice and goes through the woods again after dark. Nath is struck from behind and knocked down into a stream. He returns to the farm believing that Pete hit him, but Meg and Ellen say Pete has been in the room with them since Nath left. Soon, both Nath and Meg become obsessed with searching for the mysterious \"red house\" and agree to go into the woods every Sunday, which is the one day Nath has some free time, to look for it. They have no luck.\n\nIn the meantime, Meg begins to fall in love with Nath, but his jealous and shrewd girlfriend Tibby (Julie London) has other plans for him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Pete has secretly given local handyman and petty thug Teller (Rory Calhoun) rights to hunt on the land, as long as he keeps everyone else off of the property.\nOne Sunday, Nath cannot get out of a date with Tibby, so Meg goes off on her own to look for the red house. She finds it located in a small gully a few miles from Pete's farm along an unused dirt road. Teller fires at her to scare her away. Running away, Meg falls and breaks her leg. That evening, when Meg does not return, Nath ventures into the woods to find her and brings her back to the farm. Pete is furious that both young people defied his warning to stay out of the woods and he outright fires Nath, banishing him from the farm and from seeing Meg again.\n\nSome time later, Nath has been working for his mother at a local general store in town. With Nath's encouragement, his mother marries a long-time admirer and goes off for several weeks on her honeymoon, leaving Nath to mind the store. Nath soon takes additional work for the summer at another farm close to town. As Meg recovers from her broken leg, Pete begins to crack up. He starts calling her Jeannie, and becomes controlling and domineering. Ellen and Pete have a conversation about how it was that several years ago they rented the red house to a young couple. Pete was having an affair with the wife, Jeannie.\n\nNath catches Tibby flirting with Teller and sucker punches him. Nath confronts her and finally learns how vain and selfish she is. Teller then punches Nath, while Tibby watches with satisfaction.\n\nOne evening, Ellen decides to burn the red house down, and end Pete's obsession. As she walks through the woods, Teller, mistaking her for Nath, shoots and severely wounds her. Meg, having heard the gunshot, finds Ellen then rushes back to tell Pete, who refuses to act to help his sister. Meg phones Nath for help and he says he will bring a stretcher after he calls the sheriff and the doctor. Pete fails to dissuade Meg from returning to the woods. By the time Nath arrives, Ellen is dead. In the meantime, Teller goes to Tibby's home and persuades her to leave town with him. They are pulled over and arrested by the state police.\n\nMeg and Nath bring Ellen's body back. Meg demands the truth about the red house and who Jeannie is. Pete finally confesses that Ellen had been keeping the secret for him, about having had an affair with a married woman named Jeannie and what had happened to her and the husband. After the man discovered the affair, the couple decided to move away. Pete went to the red house to plead with Jeannie to choose between her husband and him. As they heard her husband returning, Jeannie began screaming. To stop her, Pete covered her mouth, but suffocated her. While Pete claims that he was just trying to keep her quiet and that her death was accidental, he admits that he subsequently killed the husband in cold blood. Pete buried the bodies in the basement of the ice house that sits next to the red house, and he lives in fear that they will be discovered. However, since Jeannie's husband told everyone they were leaving town, no one ever suspected they were murdered. The couple had a baby, Meg, and rather than abandon the infant, Pete and Ellen adopted her.\n\nPete takes Meg to the red house. By this point, he has completely gone crazy and thinks Meg is actually Jeannie, who is leaving him again. He begins to re-live the experience, puts his hand over her mouth and starts suffocating her. Nath and the sheriff show up in the nick of time. Pete takes off in his truck, but drives into the ice house, where the truck sinks in the large pond formed by the melted ice, and Pete drowns.\n\nThe final scene shows Nath and Meg a few days later, talking about starting a new life together as they watch the smoke from the red house, which Nath has burned down in keeping with Ellen's wishes.

{"id": "2061177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061177", "title": "BMW M Coupé and Roadster", "text": "BMW M Coupé and Roadster\n\nThe BMW M Coupé and BMW M Roadster are high performance models of the BMW Z3 and BMW Z4 coupés/roadsters produced by BMW M. The first generation was based on the BMW Z3 and was produced between 1998 and 2002. The second generation was based on the BMW Z4 and was produced between 2006 and 2008. \n\nAll models were produced in the BMW Spartanburg plant in the United States, however some major components— such as the engine and transmission— were imported from Germany.\n\nThe Z3 M Roadster was introduced in 1997 as the high performance version of the BMW Z3. Cosmetic differences between the Z3 M and the standard Z3 models included front and rear bumpers, gills, boot and mirrors.\n\nThe standard Z3 models received a facelift in 1999, however the appearance of the Z3 M was not changed.\n\nIn the 6 years from 1997 to 2002, 15,322 M Roadsters were produced. This is compared to the 300,000 standard Z3s produced in the same timeframe.\n\nThe M roadster is electronically limited to a top speed of .\n\nThe M Coupé, manufactured from 1998 until 2002, was developed under the leadership of engineer Burkhard Göschel with the intention of adding increased torsional and structural rigidity to the Z3 roadster's chassis. The development team had a hard time convincing the Board of Directors to approve the model for production, but it was eventually given the green light as long as it remained cost-effective to produce. To achieve this goal, majority of the body panels had to be shared with the M roadster, thus the doors and everything from the A-pillar forward are interchangeable between the coupé and roadster, as are most interior parts. The Z3 coupé, which combines the M coupe's body with the standard Z3 drivetrain, chassis and cosmetics was approved for production at the same time.\n\nSales were slow as it didn't generate much interest between the enthusiasts. As a result of their relative rarity, M Coupes (especially S54 powered models) retain much of their value. The S54 M Coupe is one of the lowest production BMWs with only 1112 built. It was given nicknames like \"hearse\" and \"clown shoe\" because of its distinctive styling.\n\nThe Z3M Coupe and Roadster were initially powered by the engines from the E36 M3. This means that most countries initially used the 3.2 L version of the BMW S50 engine, while North American models initially used the less powerful BMW S52 engine. The S50 produces at 7,400 rpm and at 3,250rpm, while the S52 engine produces at 6,000rpm and at 3,800rpm.\nA total of 2,999 cars were built with the S50 engine and 2,180 cars were built with the S52 engine.\n\nStarting in September 2001, the engines were upgraded to the BMW S54 engine from the E46 M3. In most countries, it produces at 7,400 rpm and at 4,900 rpm, while North American models have at 7,400 rpm and at 4,900 rpm. The difference in peak power and torque is due to the catalytic converters being located closer to the engine on the North American spec cars, which allows the catalysts to heat up faster and reduce cold start emissions. A total of 1,112 cars were built with the S54 engine.\n\nThe Z3M Coupe had the following OEM color options: Alpine White III, Imola Red II, Dakar Yellow II, Evergreen, Laguna Seca Blue, Cosmos Black, Black Sapphire Metallic, Arctic Silver Metallic, Titanium Silver Metallic, Estoril Blue Metallic, Boston Green Metallic, Oxford Green II Metallic, Steel Grey Metallic, Phoenix Yellow Metallic. \n\nThe gearbox is a ZF Type C 5-speed manual. The final drive is either 3.23:1 (S52) or 3.15:1 (S50 and S54). A limited slip differential with a maximum locking of 25 percent is standard.\n\nLike all Z3 models, the M Coupe and Roadster's suspension is made up of MacPherson struts in the front and semi-trailing arms in the rear. However, compared to the six-cylinder Z3 roadster, the M roadster included modifications such as wider front and rear tracks (by ), reduced ride height (by ), modified front suspension geometry, firmer springs and shocks, thicker anti-roll bars, stronger semi-trailing arms and a reinforced subframe.\n\nWhen the M roadster switched to the S54 engine (2/01 production), the chassis was upgraded to the stiffer springs and shocks developed for the M Coupé.\n\nThe brakes from the E36 M3 were used: four-wheel vented discs measuring on the front and on the rear. In most countries, the front discs were a two-piece \"floating rotor\" design.\n\nThe U.S. market was denied the more efficient two-piece discs offered in the rest of the world because BMW of North America was concerned that, if not properly maintained, the discs presented the possibility of failing, thus creating a legal liability. Canadian market cars were equipped with the floating discs.\n\nFront tyres were 225/45ZR17 and rear tyres were 245/40ZR17. The wheel sizes were 7.5x17-inch at the front and 9x17-inch at the rear. Early M coupes (S50 and S52 engines) had a silverly chromeline finish, whereas the later models (s54 engine) had a darker Chrome Shadow finish.\n\nThe coupé model was introduced to the public first in concept form at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show and then in production form at the 2006 Geneva International Motor Show with production starting shortly after. \n\nThe Z4 M Coupé had a fastback coupé design, resulting in a different body shape to its Z3 M Coupe predecessor. The Z4 M Coupé also did away with the controversial iDrive system. The roof added an additional weight of as compared to the roadster.\n\nThe official acceleration time is 5 seconds and the top speed is electronically limited to . The Z4 M Coupé set a laptime at the Nürburgring Nordschleife of 8 minutes and 15 seconds.\n\nThe roadster model was launched in late 2006.\n\nWeighing , the M Roadster has a from 0- of 4.7 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to . Unlike the Z3 M Roadster, the external dimensions of the Z4 M Roadster were the same as the standard Z4.\n\nThe M Coupe and M Roadster are powered by the BMW S54 straight-six engine from the E46 M3. The engine had fly-by-wire throttle and double VANOS (variable valve timing). In most countries, the engine produces at 7,900 rpm and at 4,900 rpm- the same outputs as in the M3. The engine has a redline of 8,000 rpm. Cars sold in North America have at 7,900 rpm and at 4,900 rpm. \n\nThe engine was mated to a new 6-speed \"Type H\" ZF manual transmission since the M3's original 6-speed transmission did not fit the Z4's chassis.\n\nThe Z4 uses the same limited slip differential as the E46 M3.\n\nThe suspension system consisted of a strut design at the front and a multi-link design at the rear. The springs have higher spring rates and the dampers have a more aggressive setting as compared to the Z4 M roadster. The car achieved a lateral acceleration of 0.89g on the skid pad.\n\nThe Z4 M uses hydraulic power steering, unlike the electric power steering used by the rest of the Z4 range and has thick rimmed steering wheel. Other changes include a wider front track, revised front suspension and steering geometry.\n\nMany components were shared with the E46 M3, including the rear subframe, front suspension control arms and the Continental ContiSport Contact tyres.\n\nThe braking system shares many parts in common with the E46 M3. The brake calipers are from the M3 Competition model and the brake discs (consisting of aluminum hubs, stainless steel pins, cross drilled iron floating rotors) are from the E46 M3 CSL.\n\nProduction began on 4 April 2006 and ended in 2008 when the E85/E86 Z4 was replaced by the E89 Z4. A total of 4,275 M Coupes were produced, and 5,070 M Roadsters. This included 1,815 M Coupes for North America and 3,042 M Roadsters for North America.\n\n"}

The journey from Jaffa to Jerusalem was reduced, thanks to this upgrade, from three to two days and Bab al-Wad became the one place where travellers had to stop for the night. For this purpose, the Ottomans built there an inn or caravansary, used soon after, in 1869, the year of the inauguration of the Suez Canal, by travelling royalty taking a detour to Jerusalem such as Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary, the future British king Edward VII and the future German emperor Frederick III. In 1898 the site was used again by German emperor Wilhelm II and his wife Augusta Victoria, who slept there in a tent camp. The largest bell for the church of the Augusta Victoria Foundation, initiated by Wilhelm during his 1898 visit and built between 1907 and 1910, weighed six tonnes and required that the road be widened and paved.\n\nDuring the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, this area and the nearby police fort at Latrun saw fierce fighting between Arab forces and Jewish convoys on the way to blockaded Jerusalem. Bab al-Wad and the defile it guards changed hands between the Arab Liberation Army supported by Arab irregulars, and Jewish Palmach and Haganah units, until April 20 1948, when the Arabs recaptured the heights around Bab al-Wad closing off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road.\n\nFrom mid-May 1948 on, the fort at Latrun, only two kilometres west of Bab al-Wad, was held by the Arab Legion, the very efficient, British-trained and commanded army of Transjordan. The Palmach's 10th (Harel) Brigade under the command of Lt. Col. Yitzhak Rabin, future prime minister of Israel, managed to capture Bab al-Wad itself, but the road section west of it, controlled from Latrun, remained in Jordanian hands until 1967, cutting off this main access route to Jerusalem. In order to bypass the Arab-held bottleneck, the Israelis constructed the Burma Road, named after the famous World War II road into China. This very steep bypass road was in use during the first, crucial part of the war, being replaced after just six months by a longer but safer detour route.\n\nAfter the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, when the Latrun area was captured by Israel, the main Tel Aviv–Jerusalem highway was once again constructed on the shortest route past Latrun and Sha'ar HaGai. Today's already four-lane wide Highway 1 is currently (2016) being widened due to increasing traffic, by further carving into the slopes of the Wadi Ali gorge.\n\n \n\nUntil the 2000s, the remains of armoured cars that belonged to Jewish convoys and were destroyed during the 1948 war were lining the route as a memorial to the war dead. Most of them were regular trucks with improvised armour made of two sheets of steel and a layer of wood in between, which led to them being called \"sandwich trucks\". Then they had to be relocated by the army to the two extremities of the gorge, where they have been secured against scrap metal thieves, conserved and displayed on the side of the highway.\n\nIn a park south of the main road is the Mahal Memorial Monument, which commemorates the ca. 4000 Jewish and non-Jewish military volunteers who came from abroad to help with the creation of the Jewish state in 1947–48, of whom 119 lost their lives during the war.\n\nA \"Memorial for the Pioneers of the Road to Jerusalem\", erected in memory of the Jewish Independence War fighters who died in battles fought over the road to Jerusalem, stands on the side of the highway near Neve Ilan. The 1967 work of Israeli sculptor Naomi Henrik is built of stainless steel and concrete and consists of a cluster of tubes resembling rockets that point towards Jerusalem.\n\nThe battles of 1948 were commemorated by a Hebrew song, \"Bab al-Wad\", with words by Haim Gouri and music by Shmuel Fershko. The song has been performed by numerous famous Israeli singers, such as Yafa Yarkoni, Shoshana Damari, Shlomo Gronich, and Harel Skaat. The song has four verses, with the fourth verse spoken before the final chorus.\n\nHere I walk silently<br>\nAnd I remember them, every single one<br>\nHere we fought, together, over cliffs and boulders<br>\nHere we were to one family\n\nBab al Wad<br>\nForever do remember our names<br>\nAs convoys broke through to the city<br>\nOn the roadsides lie our dead<br>\nThe iron hulk as silent as my comrade\n\nIsraelis referring to the location in daily life call it by the Hebrew name Sha'ar HaGai (שער הגיא) in Hebrew, but the famous song calls it by the Arabic name Bab al-Wad - preserving the fact that in 1948, the soldiers of the young Israel called it that. Both the Hebrew and Arabic name mean the same - \"Gate of the Valley\".\n\n\n"}

The station airs a mainstream rock format under the brand name 101.9 Rock. The station uses the same general format as, and shares some programming with, CJRQ-FM in Sudbury and CJQQ-FM in Timmins.\n\nThe station was originally launched in Iroquois Falls in 1922, as CFCH, a corporate communications service for lumber camps owned by Abitibi Power and Paper Company. It was subsequently acquired by Roy Thomson in 1930, and moved to North Bay. The station originally launched in North Bay at 930 on the AM dial, moving to 1230 in 1941 and then to 600 in 1942. CFCH was on the FM dial at 106.3 MHz for a brief period in the 1940s and 1950s. The 106.3 MHz frequency is now occupied by CFXN-FM.\n\nIn 1960, Thomson's Northern Broadcasting acquired the city's television station, CKGN, which also adopted the CFCH callsign. In 1976, Northern also acquired the FM station CKAT. Thomson subsequently sold Northern Broadcasting to a local business consortium in 1974. In 1980, the stations were sold to Telemedia.\n\nIn 1996, Telemedia swapped the stations in a move similar to its 1990 switch involving CKSO and CIGM in Sudbury.

Deaton is currently a Senior Scholar and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of Economics and International Affairs Emeritus at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Economics Department at Princeton University. His research focuses primarily on poverty, inequality, health, wellbeing, and economic development.\n\nIn 2015, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.\n\nDeaton was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He attended Hawick High School and then Fettes College as a foundation scholar, working at Portmeirion hotel in summer 1964. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Cambridge, the last with a 1975 thesis entitled \"Models of Consumer Demand and Their Application to the United Kingdom\" under the supervision of Richard Stone\".\" At Cambridge, he was later a fellow at Fitzwilliam College and a research officer working with Richard Stone and Terry Barker in the Department of Applied Economics.\n\nIn 1976 Deaton took up post at the University of Bristol as Professor of Econometrics. During this period, he completed a significant portion of his most influential work. In 1978, he became the first ever recipient of the Frisch Medal, an award given by the Econometric Society every two years to an applied paper published within the past five years in \"Econometrica\". In 1980, his paper on how demand for various consumption goods depends on prices and income was published in \"The American Economic Review\". This paper has since been hailed as one of the twenty most influential articles published in the journal in its first hundred years.\n\nIn 1983, he left the University of Bristol for Princeton University. He is currently the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of International Affairs and Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs (WWS) and the Department of Economics at Princeton. Since 2017, he holds a joint appointment with the University of Southern California where he is the Presidential Professor of Economics. He holds both British and American citizenship.\n\nIn 2015, Deaton won that year's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Deaton was \"delighted\" and described himself as \"someone who's concerned with the poor of the world and how people behave, and what gives them a good life.\" The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that economic policy intended to reduce poverty could only be designed once individuals' consumption choices were understood, saying, \"More than anyone else, Angus Deaton has enhanced this understanding. By linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics\". New York University economist William Easterly said, \"What was impressive about this Nobel is how many different fields Angus has contributed to.\" Easterly noted Deaton's bravery in the face of the political aspects of his research area and the \"tortuous details\" involved in his work, adding: \"No one accuses him of having an agenda on these questions, and there are a lot of people in this field who do have an agenda\". According to Brown University president Christina Paxson, Deaton \"is fearless about asking questions and pushing data and trying to understand the roots of some very basic questions in economics.\"\n\nDeaton is also the author of \"Letters from America\", a popular semi-annual feature in the \"Royal Economic Society Newsletter\".\n\nAlmost Ideal Demand System\n\nDeaton's first work to become known was Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), which he developed with John Muellbauer and published in \"The American Economic Review\" (AER) in 1980. As a consumer demand model, it provides a first order approximation to any demand system which satisfies the axioms of order, aggregates over consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves, is consistent with budget constraints, and is simple to estimate.\n\nAccording to a review by the American Economic Review, the paper \"introduces a practical system of demand equations that are consistent with preference maximization and have sufficient flexibility to support full welfare analysis of policies that have an impact on consumers.\" The paper was listed as one of the top 20 published works in the AER in the first 100 years of the journal.\n\nMorbidity and Mortality in the 21st Century\n\nIn 2015, Anne Case and Angus Deaton published the paper \"Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century\" in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In the article, Case and Deaton highlight the rising all-cause mortality rate among middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans in the past decade, a recent trend that was unique among \"rich\" countries. Case and Deaton found that the rising mortality rates were only occurring for white non-Hispanics and that less-educated white non-Hispanics were at the greatest risk. Further, they discovered that the increasing mortality rates among white non-Hispanics could be classified as \"deaths of despair\", most notably drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis.\" Finally, they noted that rising mortality rates were accompanied by rising morbidity rates, particularly \"[s]elf-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work\". To explain their findings, Case and Deaton point to the rising availability and abuse of opioids:\n\nAs a follow-up to their previous work, Case and Deaton received funding from the National Institute on Aging through the National Bureau of Economic Research to release a larger study that was published in 2017 entitled \"Mortality and Morbidity in the 21st Century.\" In extending their research, they found that the mortality rates for educated white non-Hispanics have begun to decrease again, although the rates for uneducated white non-Hispanics have continued to climb; at the same time, rates for Hispanics and blacks continued to decrease, regardless of educational attainment. Additionally, they found that contemporaneous resources had no effect on mortality rates and that, instead, worsening labor market opportunities for uneducated white non-Hispanics have pushed forward several \"cumulative disadvantages\" for middle-aged people, such as worsened marriage and child outcomes, and overall health.\n\nAs a result of this research, Case has opined that physical and mental distress may bolster candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Likewise, the Washington Post and a Gallup Poll showed strong correlation between support for Trump and higher death rates.\n\nRecognition and Awards\n\n1978—Frisch Medal, an award given by the Econometric Society\n\n2007—Elected president of the American Economic Association.\n\n2011—Awarded BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award of Economics, Finance and Management for his fundamental contributions to the theory of consumption and savings, and the measurement of economic wellbeing.\n\n2014—Elected to the American Philosophical Society.\n\n2015—Elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n2015—Awarded with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.\n\n2016—Knighted in the 2016 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to research in economics and international affairs.\n\n2016—Listed #14 (along with Anne Case) on the Politico 50 guide to the thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming American politics in 2016.\n\nDeaton is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, the British Academy (FBA), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHe holds honorary degrees from the University of Rome, Tor Vergata; University College London; the University of St. Andrews; and the University of Edinburgh.\n\nPreviously widowed, Deaton has two children, born in 1970 and 1971. He is married to Anne Case, the Alexander Stewart 1886 Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The couple enjoy the opera and trout fishing.\n\n\n"}

With Mary MacKillop (later Saint Mary MacKillop), he co-founded the Congregation of Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart at Penola in 1866.\n\nTenison-Woods was born in London, the sixth son (of eleven children) of James Dominick Woods, a sub-editor of \"The Times\", and his wife, Henrietta Maria Saint-Eloy Tenison, daughter of the Rev. Joseph Tenison, rector of Donoughmore, County Wicklow and of the same family as Archbishop Thomas Tenison. She became a Catholic.\n\nJulian Tenison-Woods was baptised by the Rev. John White of the Belgian Chapel, Southwark, and confirmed by Cardinal Wiseman, at that time Vicar-Apostolic of the London District. He attended Thomas Hunt's Catholic school, Kent House, Hammersmith, and, briefly, Newington Grammar School.\n\nDuring his youth there was probably a period when he fell away from his church. His own manuscript memoirs, written during his last illness, represent him as leading the life of an Anglican when 16 years old, and being converted to Catholicism soon afterwards. Tenison-Woods' biographer, the Rev. George O'Neill SJ, discusses the question at some length and gives reasons for thinking that Tenison-Woods's memory at the time of writing the memoir may be untrustworthy.\n\nIn 1846, Tenison-Woods obtained a position in \"The Times\" office, but after a few weeks went to live at Jersey with his mother whose health had failed. He returned to London in less than two years and resumed his position at \"The Times\" office. In 1849 he assisted Canon Oakley, a convert who had charge of the Catholic chapel at Islington, with a school he had established.\nIn 1850 he entered the monastery of the Passionate order at Broadway in Worcestershire and became a novice. His health began to fail and he studied at Marist seminaries near Toulon, France, where he also taught English at a naval college. Around this time his interest in geology and natural history appears to have begun.\n\nIn 1854, in England, Tenison-Woods met Robert Willson, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Hobart. The two travelled to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), arriving in Hobart on the \"Bernicia\" on 30 January 1855. Woods fell into disagreement with Willson and left for Adelaide around March/April 1855. He worked for the \"Adelaide Times\" as a sub-editor, then entered the Jesuit college at Sevenhill near Clare, South Australia.\n\nTenison-Woods was ordained as a diocesan priest on 4 January 1857 and took charge of the large parish at Penola. He published his first book, \"Geological Observations in South Australia\", in 1862. With Sister Mary MacKillop (who was later canonised), Tenison-Woods co-founded the Congregation of Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart] at Penola in 1866. He made regular long journeys over his large parish and systematically visited every place where he would find a member of his church. The climate improved his health, he was free from anxieties and passed through 10 happy years.\nTenison-Woods joined an exploring party that was starting for the interior and began a methodical study of geology and mineralogy. After four years as director of Catholic education, he continued working as a scientist and missionary priest in New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland.\n\nTenison-Woods met Adam Lindsay Gordon, of whom he afterwards wrote an account which appeared in the \"Melbourne Review\" of April 1884. Early in 1867, Tenison-Woods was transferred to Adelaide and was appointed director-general of Catholic education and secretary to Bishop Laurence Sheil, with the clerical style of \"The Very Reverend\". Another of his duties was the administration of the newly erected cathedral.\n\nTenison-Woods founded a small monthly magazine called the \"Southern Cross\" in 1867. It ceased after two years, but he made a further foray into journalism in 1870 with of \"The Chaplet and Advocate of the Children of Mary\", which may have run to no more than two issues. He was then involved, initially with Archdeacon Russell and Father Byrne, in production of the monthly \"Southern Cross and Catholic Herald\", which was dropped after the weekly \"Irish Harp and Farmers' Herald\" had become firmly established and the two amalgamated around November 1873 as \"The Harp and Southern Cross\".\n\nTenison-Woods was working long hours and under many anxieties, his health again broke down. In 1872 there was an episcopal investigation into the general conditions of the Diocese of Adelaide. The result was that Tension-Woods was deposed from his various positions and he left Adelaide. He began working in the Bathurst diocese and in 1873 went to Brisbane and worked as a missionary for almost a year. In January 1874 he left for Tasmania, stopping for a few days in Melbourne where, on 13 February, he gave a scientific lecture. In Tasmania he had great success as a missioner.\n\nTenison-Woods' district contained many formations of geological interest. He kept in touch with other scientists and built up a library of scientific books. Tenison-Woods published his first book, \"Geological Observations in South Australia\", in 1862. His \"History of the Discovery and Exploration of Australia\" (London, 1865) in two volumes, and his serialized \"Australian bibliography\" in the \"Australian Monthly Magazine\" (1866–67), show Tenison-Woods' broad knowledge. On his occasional visits to cities he sometimes gave scientific lectures. Wherever he went he was interested in the geology and natural history of the district.\n\nIn 1878, Tenison-Woods joined the Linnean Society of New South Wales, he had taken up his scientific work again after leaving Adelaide. He was elected president of the society in 1880 and took much interest in its activities. He had been for many years a fellow of the Geological Society. London. His \"Fish and Fisheries of New South Wales\" (Sydney, 1883) was published by the colonial government and William III of the Netherlands awarded Tenison-Woods a gold medal for the book.\n\nTenison-Woods was an advocate of theistic evolution. In 1880, he commented \"I can well believe that there is much truth in evolution. If tomorrow the evidence of its occurrence were established on indubitable grounds, it would be one more beautiful illustration of the plan of nature.\"\n\nIn 1883, Tenison-Woods was invited by his friend and governor of Singapore, Sir Frederick Weld, to undertake a scientific tour in the Straits Settlements. Tenison-Woods also travelled extensively in Java, the adjacent islands and the Philippines, and provided the British government with a valuable confidential report on the coal resources of the East. He also travelled to China and Japan, returning to Sydney in 1886. Shortly afterwards he was away for four months on an exploration in the Northern Territory.\n\nOn Tenison-Woods' return in May 1887 he found his eyesight and general health were weakened. He found a home in Sydney in one of the charitable communities he had founded, but was told by Cardinal Francis Moran that if he wished to remain in the diocese and exercise his priestly faculties, he was to take up his residence in a place appointed for him. Tenison-Woods disregarded his instructions. He had received and given away a large amount paid to him for his scientific work for the government and was now poor and feeble. He did not lack friends, however, and was well-cared for. He dictated his partly fanciful autobiographical memoir to his carers. One of his last works was a paper on the \"Natural History of the Mollusca of Australia\" for which he was awarded the 1888 Clarke Medal for distinguished contribution to natural science and a grant of £25 by the Royal Society of New South Wales. Early in 1889, his health began to grow steadily worse and after much patient suffering he died at St Vincent's Hospital on 7 October 1889, aged 56, and was buried in the Catholic section at Waverley Cemetery, Sydney.\n\n\nThree brothers of Woods emigrated to Australia:\n\nIn 1974 the highest peak in the D'Aguilar Range (770 m) within Brisbane Forest Park, south-east Queensland, was named Tenison-Woods Mountain. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061256", "title": "Heshen", "text": "Heshen\n\nHeshen (; ; 1 July 1750 – 22 February 1799) of the Manchu Niohuru clan, was an official of the Qing dynasty favored by the Qianlong Emperor. Born Shanbao (Shan-pao; ), his given name was later changed to Heshen. His courtesy name was Zhizhai (Chih-chai; ). He was a member of the Plain Red Banner, and known as the most corrupt official in Chinese history. Heshen was born as the son of a Manchu military officer and was selected to go to the most privileged school for Manchu aristocratic boys. He lost his mother when he was young and it was said he and his younger brother had a hard life under his stepmother. However, it was reported that Heshen was an excellent student, knowing several languages including Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca), Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan. In 1772, he began work in the Imperial Palace, assigned as an imperial bodyguard and was stationed at the gates to the Forbidden City.\n\nWithin a year of his initial employment, Heshen was promoted to vice-president of the Ministry of Revenue, and two months later was made a Grand Councilor. Within three months, he was promoted even further to a minister of the Imperial Household Department, a post usually filled with the most meritorious officials. In 1777, at the age of 27, Heshen was given the privilege of riding a horse within the Forbidden City, a prestigious privilege given only to high-ranking officials of elderly age. It was not long before Heshen was given control of both the Ministry of Revenue and the Civil Council, allowing him to control the revenue of the entire empire, and appoint his own henchmen to important posts within the officials.\n\nThe Salar Jahriyya Sufi revolt was put down by Fuk'anggan along with Agui and Li Shiyao Gansu in 1784, while Heshen was recalled for his failure during the revolt.\n\nHeshen's hold on the Qianlong Emperor was further strengthened when in 1790, his son was married to the emperor's tenth and favorite daughter, Hexiao. Once secure of the Qianlong Emperor's favor and approbation, Heshen enjoyed almost complete freedom of action. He became openly corrupt and practiced extortion on a grand scale. His supporters within the imperial system followed his lead, and his military associates prolonged campaigns in order to continue the benefits of additional funds. He abrogated powers and official posts, including that of Grand Councilor, and regularly stole public funds and tax revenue. Taxes were raised again and again, and this led to the suffering of the people. Unfortunately, their suffering was compounded by severe floods of the Yellow River - an indirect result of the corruption where dishonest officials pocketed funds that were meant for the upkeep of canals and dams. Rising prices of rice led to many that simply starved to death. This widespread corruption and nepotism was the start of a century that led to the downfall of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn 1793, Heshen was responsible for hosting the Macartney Embassy to the imperial court.\n\nThe shame of Heshen's corruption came to play when the Qianlong Emperor abdicated in February 1796, the full damage of the corruption was now in wide view. However, Qianlong continued to rule China behind the scenes under the grand title of \"Taishang Huang\" (Retired Emperor). It was not until Qianlong's death on 7February 1799 that his successor, the Jiaqing Emperor, was able to prosecute Heshen. On February12, Heshen was arrested along with Minister Du Daozhao. Declared guilty by an imperial edict, he was condemned to slow slicing. The Jiaqing Emperor spared Heshen this horrible death out of respect for his half-sister Gurun Princess Hexiao, and instead ordered him to commit suicide (by hanging himself with a rope of golden silk) in his home on 22 February, sparing his family.\n\nFrom the 24 years that Heshen caught the Qianlong Emperor's attention and favor, he had amassed an incredible fortune. In the Jiaqing Emperor's confiscation of Heshen's property, his wealth estate included:\n\n3,000 rooms in his estates and mansions, of land, 42 bank branches, 75 pawnbroker branches, 60,000 taels of pure gold, 100 large ingots of pure gold, (1,000 taels each), 56,600 medium silver ingots, (100 taels each), 9,000,000 small silver ingots, (10 taels each), 58,000 livres/pounds of foreign currency, 1,500,000 copper coins, 600 lb of top-quality Jilin ginseng, 1,200 jade charms, 230 pearl bracelets (each pearl comparable in size to large cherries or longans), 10 large pearls (each the size of apricots), 10 large ruby crystals, 40 large sapphire crystals, 40 tablefuls of solid-silver eating utensils, (served 10 per table), 40 tablefuls of solid-gold eating utensils, (served 10 per table), 11 coral rocks (each over a meter in height), 14,300 bolts of fine silk, 20,000 sheets of fine sheep-fur wool, 550 fox hides, 850 raccoon dog hides, 56,000 sheep and cattle hides of varying thickness, 7,000 sets of fine clothing (for all four seasons), 361,000 bronze and tin vases and vessels, 100,000 porcelain vessels made by famous masters, 24 highly decorative solid-gold beds (each with eight different types of inlaid gemstones), 460 high quality European clocks, 606 servants, 600 women in his harem.\n\nHis total property was ultimately estimated at around 1,100 million taels of silver, reputedly estimated to be an amount equivalent to the imperial revenue of the Qing government for 15 years. In his chief butler Liu Quan's quarters, a large quantity of treasures including 240,000 silver taels were also discovered. The Jiaqing Emperor charged Heshen with 20 crimes, of which \"defiance of imperial supremacy\" and \"power transcendence\" accounted for half.\n\nThe influence of Heshen however did not end with his death, as corruption continued to spread through different levels in and out of the capital, among both civil and military personnel. Bannermen developed habits that made them useless as a military force. The Chinese Green Standard Army was beset with irregular practice and had lost much of its fighting spirit shown in the early Qing Dynasty. The habits of luxury and big spending led to moral degradation and the general decline of the dynasty. The Qianlong Emperor's Ten Great Campaigns were completed at the cost of 120 million taels, against an annual revenue of some 40 million taels. The result of these massive spendings and increasing trend towards luxury set the path towards financial instability within the later part of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nFor more than two hundred years, and right through to the present, Heshen has been a stock villain role in theatrical, film and television productions. Chinese actors Wang Gang and Chen Rui are among the best known persons who have portrayed Heshen on screen: the former gave the character of Heshen a comical touch with his plump figure; the latter, who played Heshen in the 2003 television series \"Qianlong Dynasty\", was said to resemble the historical Heshen more closely as compared to Wang Gang.\n\nHong Kong actor Ruco Chan played Heshen in the 2018 TVB series \"Succession War\", a fictional depiction of the final 28 days of his life.\n\nThe widespread view of Heshen as a corrupt official most likely originated from Qing Dynasty historical records, and only the Qing emperor had the authority to determine what content was to be kept in the documents, presenting a possible case of bias against Heshen.\n\nThe alternative argument states that whatever the emperor dictates becomes the content of the records. The many official positions held by Heshen could have posed a threat to the authority of the Jiaqing Emperor, and produced a sense of jealousy to his power and influence over the imperial court, as well as the more legitimate threat to the emperor. Whether Heshen was an honest official that worked for the empire did not matter to the emperor, because Heshen still held a prominent position. It is uncertain whether Heshen yielded significant respect from the other officials during the Qianlong Emperor's reign or the administrations simply feared his power. The Jiaqing Emperor, whether acting from the threat of Heshen's overarching influence over the court or from jealousy, with the influence of other officials who disliked Heshen, could have brought charges against Heshen through legal pretexts that would condemn him to a death sentence.\n\nIt is argued that the majority of Heshen's wealth were originally from gifts of the Qianlong Emperor, not from money siphoned by corrupt actions.\n\nSeveral decades after Heshen's death, his former residence was later given to Prince Gong as the latter's official residence. The estate, known as the Prince Gong Mansion, is now preserved as a museum and a tourist attraction. It is located at 17 Qianhai Road West in Beijing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2061264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061264", "title": "Sisters of St. Joseph", "text": "Sisters of St. Joseph\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph, also known as the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph and abbreviated C.S.J. or S.S.J., is a Roman Catholic religious congregation of women founded in Le Puy-en-Velay, France, in 1650. This Congregation, named for Saint Joseph, has approximately 14,000 members worldwide: about 7,000 in the United States; 2,000 in France; and are active in fifty other countries.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Joseph comprise three international congregations (Lyons, Chambéry, and Annecy) and four federations (French, Italian, US, and Canadian), representing more than 14,000 Sisters worldwide.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Lyons number nearly 1,000, serving in four provinces (Maine, Mexico, India and Europe) in fifteen countries. The Sisters operate many Catholic schools and hospitals in France, the United States, Canada, Japan and England. In India they operate hospitals, homes, and orphanages.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph was founded by Jean-Pierre Medaille (although older accounts attribute his to his brother, Jean Paul). Medaille sought to establish an ecclesiastically approved congregation of women who would profess simple vows, live in a small group, with no specific apostolates and would dress in a common garb of the women of their day. The original six sisters were Anna Brun, an orphan; Marguerite Burdier; war widow, Claudia Chastel; Anna Chraleyer; Anna Vey, age 15; and Francoise Eyraud, a hospital administrator, served as superior of the new community for 30 years. The Bishop of LePuy, France, Henri de Maupas gave the foundation canonical status. Although the Congregation celebrates October 15, 1650 as its beginning, there is evidence that points to an earlier founding, more likely between 1646 and 1650. All the women made ribbon and lace that gave them some income to support themselves. In turn they taught others to make lace and ribbon.\n\nThe new Congregation enjoyed rapid growth, expanding into eighteen houses during the first decade. By the time of the French Revolution, almost 150 years later, the Sisters had spread to twelve dioceses in the southeast corner of France. The Congregation of Saint Joseph was disbanded during the French Revolution. The convents and chapels of the community were confiscated in 1793. The Sisters were forced to choose between returning to their families or leaving France to join communities in other countries. Some Sisters who remained became martyrs. Three in Dauphiné and two in Haute-Loire were sent to the guillotine because they refused to take the Civil Oath. Others were imprisoned at St-Didier, Feurs and Clermont.\n\nThe congregation was re-established in 1807 by Mother Saint John Fontbonne in Lyon, France. As word of the Sisters' services and good deeds grew, dioceses throughout France requested the services of the restored Congregation. Houses were established in the dioceses of Lyon, Chambéry, Annecy, Gap, Bourg, and Bordeaux.\n\nIn 1902 many French houses of the congregation were closed by the Government, in consequence of which a large number of Sisters left for Denmark, Russia and the United States. In 1996 the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg re-joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon as part of the latter's European Province.\n\nThe center of the Congregation is in Rome. Other Provinces and Regions are located in Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, India, Italy, Mozambique, Norway, Pakistan, Sweden and Tanzania. The order has approximately 1,800 sisters in 18 countries.\n\nIn 1812 a colony of Sisters of St. Joseph was sent from Lyon to Chambéry, in Savoy, France under Mother St. John Marcoux. She in turn sent sisters to Turin and to Pignerole in the Piedmont, thus giving rise to new branches of Saint Joseph sisters. In 1843 Mother Félicité became Mother Superior. More than eighty houses rose under her direction, and when, in 1861, a state normal school was opened at Rumilly, Savoy, France. it was placed in charge of the sisters. Meanwhile, the Chambéry sisters had been constituted a diocesan congregation, but as years went on a stronger administration became necessary.\n\nThe rule was therefore revised to meet the requirements of a generalate, and papal approbation was granted in 1874 by rescript of Pius IX. Under the new form of government the congregation is subject to a Superior General, whose term of office is six years and is divided into provinces, each possessing a novitiate. The novices, after two years probation, make annual vows for two years, after which they bind themselves by perpetual vows. The rule is based on that of St. Augustine.\n\nIn 1819 a foundation from the motherhouse in Lyon was established in the Diocese of Belley under the leadership of Mother Saint Joseph Chaney. In 1823 the Sisters of that diocese formally separated from community in Lyon. They became a new and independent diocesan congregation under the leadership of Reverend Mother Saint Benoit Cornillon and the authority of Bishop Alexander Devie. Several other foundations spread from France throughout the world. In 1996 the Bourg congregation merged with the founding congregation of Lyon, as part of the latter's European Province.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy is an international congregation of about 500 sisters serving in the Congo, England, France, Gambia, India, Ireland, Senegal, Switzerland, Tanzania and Wales.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the Congregation was revived Mother St.John Fontbonne, on 14th July 1808. Ss Superior General, she undertook the consolidation and expansion of the Congregation to other parts of France. In response to a request from Bishop Rey who had previously worked with them in Pignerol, five Sisters arrived in Annecy on 7th May 1833. The new Congregation grew and developed, and their first mission in India was established in 1849. A provincial house and novitiate are located in Visakhapatnam (once known as Waltair), Andhra Pradesh. In 1891, a school was established to help educate the children of the Roman Catholic families based in Visakhapatnam. The school which was named, St Joseph's Girls High School continues to operate to this day,and is the second oldest school in Visakhapatnam. It is one of the oldest institution setup exclusively for girls in India.\n\nIn the summer of 1864, two Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy set out on a voyage from India to the UK to open a community in the small town of Devizes, Wiltshire, England. In 1946, Llantarnam Abbey in Wales was bought by the Sisters of St. Joseph and is home to a large community of Sisters. The Sisters farm the adjoining land. Llantarnam Abbey in Cwmbran, South Wales stands on the site of a medieval Cistercian monastery. The Tŷ Croeso ecumenical retreat center adjoins the Abbey.\n\nThere are eight houses in the United Kingdom, under the provincial house and novitiate at Llantarnam Abbey. The congregation now numbers 60, in charge of 10 elementary day and boarding-schools, with an attendance of about 2000. In Scotland at St Mary's College, Blairs, 15 sisters have charge of the household arrangements and work of the college.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, the Bhubaneswar Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy opened St. Joseph's Hospital in the city of Agartala, Tripura, India.\nThe Federation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph is a union of all the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the United States who claim a common origin in the foundation at LePuy, France in 1650. It was formed in 1966 and as of 2020 includes approximately 4,200 members of 16 Congregations throughout the United States.\n\nMember congregations are:\n\nIn 1847 the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, in response to an appeal of Bishop Francis Kenrick, sent four members of the community to Philadelphia to take charge of St. John's Orphan Asylum, until that time under the Sisters of Charity. The Know-Nothing spirit, which had but a short time previously led to the Philadelphia riots was still rampant, and the sisters had much to suffer from bigotry and difficulties of many kinds. Shortly afterwards they were given charge of several parochial schools, and thus entered on what was to be their chief work in the coming years.\n\nIn October 1858, under the patronage of St. John Neumann, the congregation in Philadelphia began to take a more definite development by the establishment of a mother-house at Mount St. Joseph, Chestnut Hill. When the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Louis formed a generalate in 1863 (approved later by the Holy See), the congregation of Philadelphia preserved its autonomy, by the wish of the bishop. When the number of religious members increased to between three and four hundred, and the works entrusted to them became so numerous and varied as to necessitate an organization more detailed and definite, steps were undertaken to obtain the papal approbation, which was received in 1895.\n\nDuring the Civil War, detachments of sisters nursed the sick soldiers in Camp Curtin and the Church Hospital, Harrisburg. Despite anti-Catholic sentiments from doctors and soldier-nurses who did not appreciate the sisters' presence, the sisters worked at the camp until its closure in April 1864. Shortly after, under Surgeon General Smith, they undertook more active duty on the floating hospital, Whilldin, which received the wounded from both sides at the battle of Yorktown, and other southern battle-fields.\n\nFor two thirds of the 1900s, the group supplied teachers to hundreds of elementary and secondary schools in the Philadelphia area, educating generations of children and young adults. The trademark white triangle that was worn as part of the sisters' veil was present until 1974. The changes in life style and ministry that were common in Catholic religious institutes of women in the late 1960s took a little longer to catch up with this group who held on to convent living in traditional parish settings as well as a modified habit and veil up to the mid-1980s.\n\nFrom a membership high of close to 2,500 is the mid-sixties, the current 2020 membership is under 690 with most of the membership in full or partial retirement.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia sponsored institutions: Saint Joseph Academy McSherrystown, Pennsylvania; Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Flourtown, Pennsylvania); Villa St Joseph; Saint Mary By-The-Sea Retreat House in Cape May Point, New Jersey; Norwood-Fontbonne Academy; Holy Family Academy (Bayonne, NJ); SSJ Center for Spirituality Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia; Bethlehem Retirement Village, Flourtown, PA; Sisters of Saint Joseph Welcome Center, Philadelphia (Kensington), PA; and Chestnut Hill College, in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood is an independent diocesan congregation. \nIn the spring of 1856 the Right Rev. John Loughlin, first Bishop of Brooklyn, applied to the mother-house at Philadelphia for sisters, and two religious were named for the new mission, joined during the same year by a sister from Buffalo. St. Mary's Academy, Williamsburg, was opened on September 8, 1856, and in the following year a parochial school was inaugurated. In 1860 the mother-house, novitiate, and boarding school were removed to Flushing, Long Island, whence the activity of the sisters was gradually extended over the diocese. In 1903 the mother-house and novitiate were again transferred to Brentwood, New York, where an academy was opened the same year.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood sponsor, among other ministries: Saint Joseph's College (New York), St. Joseph High School (Brooklyn), The Mary Louis Academy, Fontbonne Hall Academy, Sacred Heart Academy (New York), Bishop Kearney High School (New York City), Academia Maria Reina and Maria Regina Residence, a skilled nursing facility.\n\nIn 1869 the Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood, (then located in Flushing, New York) sent three pioneer sisters to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania: Sisters Hortense Tello, Xavier Phelan, and Sister Austin Keane, a native of nearby Loretto, Pennsylvania, who had been baptized by Father Demetrius Gallitzin, the pioneering priest in western Pennsylvania. Five days after their arrival in Ebensburg, the three St. Joseph Sisters opened a day-school and a boarding-school, Mount Gallitzin Seminary for Boys.\n\nIn 1902 a four-story school and convent to serve as both Mt. Gallitzin Academy and their new motherhouse was dedicated in Baden. Their original motherhouse in Ebensburg was remodeled into an infant home where they nurtured newborns and toddlers from 1923 to 1959.\n\nFrom 1926 to 1948, 15 Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden ministered in China. Their mission in Hunan Province included an orphanage and hospital. Sister Theresa Joseph Lung, a native of Hunan who entered the congregation in 1933, remained in China after the sisters left and died there in 1994. The community has sheltered refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and has been instrumental in helping them find homes in this country. In 1997, the sisters started Girls they established a separate non-profit corporation to operate Villa St. Joseph, a non-sectarian, 120-bed, long-term care facility with a specialized unit for Alzheimer's patients.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden number just under 200 women. They are chaplains, foster parents, and pastoral ministers; they include a lawyer, drug and alcohol interventionists, counselors, retreat directors, and college professors.\n\nIn 1873 four Sisters of St. Joseph of Brooklyn (now Brentwood) arrived at St. Thomas parish in Jamaica Plain. They found a city filled with new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe who had joined the earlier Irish immigrants. Four days after their arrival the sisters opened an elementary school for girls in the basement of the church. 200 students applied the first day. By 1877, with the acceptance of 30 boys, St. Thomas School became the first co-educational Catholic school in New England. In the Archdiocese of Boston, the sisters opened, staffed, and/or sponsored over 125 educational institutions, including schools for children with special needs.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph, Sister John Berchmans and Sister Elizabeth, were among those who volunteered to care for people during the influenza epidemic of 1918. During the Depression, they fed the hungry from their kitchen doors. In the 1950s, four Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston were missioned to New Mexico to teach in parish schools. Since that time sisters have ministered in Santa Rosa, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Clovis, and Springer, New Mexico. San Ricardo Parish in Lima, Peru, became the home to a group of Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston in 1965.\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston sponsor:\nBethany Health Care Center and Bethany Hill School, both in Framingham, Massachusetts; Fontbonne, the Early College of Boston in Milton, MA; Jackson School and Walnut Park Montessori School in Newton, MA; Saint Joseph Preparatory High School and Literacy Connection Literacy Connection in Brighton, MA; Regis College in Weston, MA; and Casserly House in Roslindale, MA;\n\nThe mother-house is in Brighton.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph were introduced into the Diocese of Buffalo in 1854, when three sisters from Carondelet, St. Louis, made a foundation at Canandaigua, New York. Two years later one of these sisters was brought to Buffalo by Bishop Timon to assume charge of Le Couteulx St. Mary's Institution for the instruction of deaf mutes, which had lately been established. The novitiate was removed from Canandaigua to Buffalo in 1861. The community developed rapidly and soon spread through different parts of the diocese. By 1868 the sisters were sufficiently strong to direct their own affairs, and elected their own superior, thus forming a new diocesan congregation. In 1891 the mother-house and novitiate were removed to the outskirts of the city, where an academy was erected.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Buffalo sponsor Mount Saint Joseph Academy in Buffalo.\n\nIn 1854 four Sisters of St. Joseph came from St. Louis, at the invitation of Bishop Timon of Buffalo, to Canandaigua, NY. In 1868, the Diocese of Rochester was created, and the community divided creating 2 communities, one in Buffalo and the other in Rochester, now with its own mother-house and novitiate at St. Mary's Boys' Orphan Asylum, later transferred to the Nazareth Academy, Rochester.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Rochester sponsor Nazareth Schools; St. Joseph's Neighborhood Center; Daystar; the Sisters of Saint Joseph Volunteer Corps; St. Joseph's Northside Outreach and Prayer Ministry\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Erie were founded in 1860 by Mother Agnes Spencer of Carondelet, Missouri, who, with two other sisters, took charge of St. Ann's Academy at Corsica, Pennsylvania, where postulants were admitted. In 1864 a hospital was opened at Meadville, and the sisters took charge of the parochial schools of that city. Villa Maria Academy was opened in 1892 and in 1897 was made the novitiate and mother house of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the Erie diocese.\n\nAmong the sisters ministries are: Villa Maria Elementary School, Villa Maria Academy, Bethany House Ministry, The Heritage Apartments, Saint Vincent Health Center, Saint Mary's Home of Erie, SSJ Neighborhood Network, St. Patrick Haven, St. James Haven, and Faithkeepers Trail\n\nIn 1880 several sisters from the mother-house at Buffalo made a foundation at Watertown, New York, which was later strengthened by the accession of another sister from the Erie mother-house. Sister M. Josephine Donnelly, formerly of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Erie is considered by some to be the foundress of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Watertown., as she remained when other sisters moved on to start a foundation in Michigan. From Watertown as a centre missions were opened in other parts of the diocese.\n\nIn 1883 four Sisters of St. Joseph arrived at Newton, Kansas, from Rochester, New York, and opened their first mission. After remaining there a year they located at Concordia, Kansas, in the fall of 1884, and established the first motherhouse in the West, in what was then the Diocese of Leavenworth. The congregation has hospitals and schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago and the Dioceses of Marquette, Rockford, Kansas City, Omaha, Lincoln, and Concordia. The sisters currently so work in Brazil and New Mexico. Diocese of Concordia is now Diocese of Salina \n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia sponsor Nazareth Convent and Academy, Manna House; and From 1922 to 1989 the sisters also operated Marymount College.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the community revived under the leadership of Jeanne Fontbonne. The order grew and branched out. One of these branches became the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chambéry, founded in 1812 in the town of Chambéry in south-eastern France. Jane Sedgwick of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, desired to establish a Catholic school in Lee, Massachusetts. Since there weren't enough sisters in the United States to aid in the running of the school, Jane eventually went to Rome to appeal to Pope Leo XIII to send help. In 1885, five sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambéry arrived in Lee to open the school.\nThe novitiate was transferred to Hartford, Connecticut in 1898. The foundation spread into Connecticut and eventually into other parts of the United States.\n\nIn 2007, seven congregations of the Sisters of Saint Joseph in the central United States merged to form an entirely the new Congregation, which is now called the Congregation of Saint Joseph. The Congregation numbered about 700 as of 2011.\n\nIn 1854 Sisters were sent from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg house in France to establish a house at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in the Diocese of Natchez. In 1863 a novitiate was opened at New Orleans. After establishing a central house in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Sisters extended their ministry to the poor and suffering of Louisiana and Mississippi, opening schools, hospitals and an orphanage. Schools were subsequently opened among the French Canadians in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nBy 1962, the Bourg Congregation had six provinces, three in Europe and three in the United States, with missions in Africa and Latin America. In July 1977, the six provinces voted to become two separate congregations, one based in Europe, the other in America. On November 30, 1977, Rome officially declared the three American provinces to be a new Congregation in the Church: the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. The name Medaille was chosen because it is the family name of the Jesuit priest who helped found the Sisters in 1650 and because the Sisters were geographically located in the north, central and southern areas of the United States.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of Cleveland are chiefly engaged in the parochial schools. The sisters currently support St. Joseph Academy in Cleveland, Ohio; River's Edge, Women's Outreach Center, Seeds of Literacy, WellSpring Bookstore and the CSJ Prayer Line.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph were established in La Grange, Illinois, October 9, 1899, by two Sisters under Mother Stanislaus Leary, formerly superior of the diocesan community at Rochester, New York. On July 14, 1900, the cornerstone of the mother-house was laid. Currently the sisters sponsor Nazareth Academy, a Catholic co-educational high school in La Grange Park, Illinois. \n\nAmong the ministries sponsored by Sisters of St. Joseph of La Grange are the School on Wheels, Nazareth Academy, Ministry of the Arts, and Christ in the Wilderness\n\nIn 1889 Sisters of St. Joseph from the Diocese of Ogdensburg, New York established a new congregation at Kalamazoo, Michigan. The founding sisters came to Kalamazoo at the request of the Diocese of Detroit and Msgr. Francis O'Brien for the purpose of establishing a hospital, later named Borgess Hospital. At about the same time these first sisters, under the leadership of Mother Margaret Mary Lacy, began an orphanage and a school in addition to establishing their motherhouse at Nazareth on the outskirts of the city of Kalamazoo. The novitiate was transferred, in 1897, to Nazareth, a hamlet founded by the Sisters on a farm.\n\nAmong the institutions sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Nazareth are the Dillon Complex for Independent Living, Transformations Spirituality Center, Ascension Health and Our Lady of Guadalupe Middle School for Girls \n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Tipton were founded in 1888 by Gertrude Moffitt at St. John the Baptist Parish in Tipton, Indiana. The sisters worked as teachers in a number of parish schools; opened and staffed St. Joseph Academy from 1892 until its closure in 1972; sponsored Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana (previously Howard County Hospital, now St. Vincent Kokomo Hospital), and started the Hospice St. Joseph mission in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (now administered by the Diocese of Norwich, CT.) \n\nIn 2007, the Tipton community joined with six other communities to form the Congregation of St. Joseph. In 2016, the property owned by the Sisters in Tipton was sold to the Diocese, which now operates the St. Joseph Retreat and conference Center. The few remaining sisters moved to other locations of the Congregation of St. Joseph.\n\nIn 1853 seven sisters from Carondelet, Missouri, opened a private orphanage and hospital in Wheeling, and in 1856 took possession of a building chartered by the Assembly of Virginia for a hospital. From 19 October 1860, the community was independent of the St. Louis mother-house. During the Civil War the hospital was rented by the Government and the sisters enrolled in government service. After the war and the reorganization of the hospital on its present lines, the sisters extended their activities to various parts of the diocese.\n\nThe motherhouse was included in the Mount Saint Joseph listing on the National Register of Historic Places, added in 2008.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Wheeling sponsor the SSJ Health and Wellness Foundation, the SSJ Charitable Fund and a variety of programs under Holy Family Child Care & Development.\n\nIn 1883, Mother Stanislaus Leary of Rochester, New York stopped in Kansas en route to Arizona, and opened a mission which would develop into the Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia. In August 1887, four Sisters of St. Joseph were commissioned to go from Concordia, Kansas, to open a parochial school at Abilene, Kansas, at that time in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leavenworth. In the fall of 1887, word was received from Rome that the state of Kansas had been divided into dioceses. At the direction of Bishop Fink, who did not wish to lose the sisters from his diocese, the Abilene sisters constituted themselves a separate congregation with an act of incorporation of March 25, 1888. The following year the Right Rev. L. M. Pink, Bishop of Leavenworth, decided that these Sisters should belong to his diocese exclusively, and in so doing they became the nucleus of a new diocesan congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph, having their motherhouse established at Abilene, under the title of Mount St. Joseph's Academy.\n\nThe congregation increased in numbers and soon branched out, doing parochial school work throughout the diocese. In 1892 the name of the Diocese of Leavenworth was changed to Kansas City, Kansas, and for the time being the Sisters of St. Joseph were diocesan Sisters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City. In 1896, when the re-division of the three Kansas dioceses, was begun, Bishop Fink of Kansas City, had their motherhouse transferred from Abilene to Parsons. But after the division was made the following year, Parsons was in the Wichita diocese, and the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph being in Parsons, the congregation belonged to the Wichita Diocese, having mission-houses in both the Diocese of Concordia and the Diocese of Kansas City. In 1907 a colony of these Sisters opened a sanitarium at Del Norte, Colorado, in the Diocese of Denver.\n\nIn 1950, the congregation responded to the need for medical services in Kyoto, Japan. Three sisters began a mission which today sponsors a kindergarten, day nursery, medical services for senior citizens, a disabled children's hospital, and a special education school.\n\nWhen the sisters relocated to a new motherhouse in 2018, the previous one was taken over by Saint Francis Ministries, an Episcopal child and family services ministry, to house teenage girls aging out of foster care, and also a Head Start Program.\n\nAt the close of the American Civil War, the most Reverend Augustin Verot, Bishop of Savannah and Administrator Apostolic of Florida, visited his native city of LePuy where he challenged the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to St. Augustine. Many sisters volunteered. The chosen eight were Sister Marie Sidonie Rascle, Superior: and Sisters Marie Julie Roussel, Marie Josephine Deleage, Marie Clemence Freycenon, St. Pierre Borie, Marie Joseph Cortial, Julie Clotilde Arsac, and Marie Celenie Joubert. They arrived in Florida at Picolata Landing on the shores of the St. Johns River, September 2, 1866.\n\nThe sisters from France adjusted heroically to a different language, culture, and climate with joy and faith. They welcomed new members as they mourned the disproportionate number of those who succumbed to disease and unhealthy conditions. At the direction of Bishop Verot, the sisters were sent to six missions throughout Florida and Georgia. Their primary ministry was to black people. Owing to the departure of the Sisters of Mercy from the city, the education of the whites also devolved on the new community.\n\nBy 1876 the sisters in Georgia had been separated from those in France, but the sisters in Florida were established as a province of LePuy. At the close of the century, provincial government was abruptly terminated by Bishop John Moore. This brought about the establishment of the Diocesan Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of St. Augustine, Florida, in 1899.\nTo maintain their charitable works and to provide self-support, the sisters erected academies. These institutions served as centers of catechetical work until they were relinquished and replaced by parochial and diocesan schools. The sisters augmented their resources by such means as lace-making and private lessons in art, music, and language.\n\nDuring the years of rapid expansion in the developing Church of Florida, and with the support of Archbishop Joseph P. Hurley, the majority of the sisters gave their time to education, which included instruction of students who were deaf, blind, developmentally disabled, or otherwise handicapped. Gradually they became more involved in the multi-faceted aspects of health care; and they assumed work with the aging, unwed mothers, and migrants. The Congregation opened schools in Puerto Rico in the fifties. Two decades later in 1976, the sisters in Puerto Rico became an independent institute.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange is among the youngest of the American congregations and traces its roots through the St. Joseph congregations of La Grange, Illinois; Concordia, Kansas; Rochester, New York; and Carondelet, Missouri.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were established in 1912 by Mother Bernard Gosselin. She and eight sisters left LaGrange, Illinois, near Chicago to establish what is now St. Bernard's High School in Eureka, California. As the Congregation grew, the Sisters were better able to address more of the needs of the area. The 1918 flu pandemic presented a new challenge to the community. The Sisters responded as best they could at the time, but they realized that by establishing a hospital they could provide a health care service which would effectively address the personal, social and spiritual needs of the area. In 1920, the Sisters opened St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka. Today the hospital is by far the largest medical facility on Coastal California north of its even larger medical facility located in Santa Rosa, California, as well as others in Southern California.\n\nBy 1922, the Sisters were teaching in several Southern California areas and recognized that the community could better develop its ministries by moving the Motherhouse to Orange. The first ministries of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were in education and health care. Schools and hospitals were staffed primarily by the Sisters and in the 1940s and 1950s the number of institutions directed by the Congregation increased steadily. In the 1940s the Sisters extended their work in health, education and religious instruction to the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia.\n\nToday, the Congregation’s commitment to education is expressed in a variety of forms including elementary, secondary, university and other adult education. The commitment to extend their healing mission is expressed through acute care hospitals, rehabilitation programs, home health care, community education, primary care clinics, and wellness programs. The works of the Congregation have expanded, however, beyond education and health care to also include such things as helping new immigrants, feeding the hungry, giving shelter to the homeless, and fostering spiritual development.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange are one of three sponsoring religious communities of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. They also have a special partnership with the Western American Province of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary dating back to the 1968 signing of the Marymount Accords when St. Joseph's College of Orange merged with Marymount College of Los Angeles and assumed the Marymount name. Five years later, Marymount College merged with Loyola University of Los Angeles as the school assumed its current name, Loyola Marymount University.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Orange sponsor the following institutions: École Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, San Francisco; Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles; Mission Hospital, Mission Viejo; Queen of the Valley Medical Center, Napa; St. Jude Medical Center, Fullerton; and Rosary High School, Fullerton (1965–1976).\n\nIn 1906 Father Joseph Forest requested of the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to the Diocese of Portland, Maine. With the bishop's approval, eight Sisters made their way to Maine where they would staff a parochial school and a girls' boarding school in Jackman. The need was for bilingual teachers and none of the Sisters were familiar with English. They made haste to learn words and expressions so they could communicate with the children. At the time of their arrival, there were approximately 80 families in Jackman, mostly of Canadian origin so they spoke French. Children came from miles around, even from Canada, to be educated by the Sisters. Many of the children went home only at the end of the school year because of transportation and harsh weather. A second group of Sisters came into Maine in 1909, this time in South Berwick. The site of the convent was the former Paul's Hotel, where Lafayette had stayed on one of his trips to the United States. The Sisters became known primarily for their education apostolate in the diocese.\n\nThe Sisters in Maine maintained their link with the Motherhouse in Lyon, France through frequent correspondence as well as the regular canonical visits from the Mother General or one of her assistants. Only in 1958, as the number of Sisters increased sufficiently to establish a Province in Maine did the Congregation appoint a provincial superior.\n\nIn September 1880, seven Sisters of St. Joseph were sent from Flushing, Long Island, to take charge of a parochial school at Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. They were followed, two years later, by seven Sisters for Webster, and in 1883 by twelve more for the cathedral parish school in Springfield. In 1885 the Springfield mission was constituted the motherhouse of an independent diocesan congregation.\n\nAmong the ministries sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield are Mont Marie Child Care Center, Mont Marie Health Care Center, Inc, Mont Marie Senior Residence, and Mont Marie Labyrinth.\n\nAs of 2015, there were about 250 Sisters the Springfield Congregation continuing to serve through a variety of ministries.\n\nIn 1902 nine Sisters of St. Joseph from the mother-house at Le Puy took charge of the school in the French parish of St-Roch, Fall River, Massachusetts. The accession of other members from the mother-house enabled the community to take charge of three other schools in the city attached to French parishes. In 1906 St. Theresa's Convent was formally opened as the provincial house of the community, which was legally incorporated in the same year, and a novitiate was established. In the mid 1970s, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Fall River merged with the Springfield Congregation.\n\nIn 1873 the Rev. Charles Boylan of Rutland (town), Vermont petitioned the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Flushing, Long Island, for sisters to take charge of his school. Several sisters were sent, and a novitiate was opened at Rutland on October 15, 1876. The Sisters of Saint Joseph founded Mount Saint Joseph Academy. In 2001, Sisters of St. Joseph of Rutland, Vermont joined the Springfield community which also covers Worcester, the Berkshires, Rhode Island and even Louisiana and Uganda.\n\nOn September 20, 1966, the six separate Canadian congregations: Toronto, Hamilton, London, Peterborough, Pembroke and Sault Ste. Marie, formed the Canadian Federation.\n\nThe mother house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Toronto was established from Le Puy, France, in 1851 by Mother Delphine Fontbonne and three other Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia. They took charge of an already established orphanage at 100 Nelson Street (now Jarvis). The city was filled with Irish immigrants who had fled the ravages of famine at home, and the Sisters attended to the needs of orphans, widows and people who were sick and dying.\n\nFor many years, the mother house was at Morrow Park in north Toronto. The sisters taught in many schools across Canada since their establishment in the country. In Toronto, some of their schools included: St. Joseph's Morrow Park Catholic Secondary School, St. Joseph's College School, St. Joseph's Islington, and St. Joseph's Commercial as well as St. John. They also established St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, and for many years ran the Sacred Heart Orphanage and the House of Providence for poor persons, among many other charities. In higher education, the sisters established St. Joseph's College in the University of St. Michael's College.\n\nTheir current mother house is on O'Connor Drive in Toronto, and their works continue under the mantle of Fontbonne Ministries.\n\nIn 2012, four congregations (Hamilton, London, Peterborough and Pembroke) decided to come together to form a new congregation – The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada.\n\nThe first Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada came to Toronto from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia, in the fall of 1851. In 1852 five sisters from the mother-house at Toronto established a foundation at Hamilton, where they at once opened an orphanage and began their work in the parochial schools of the city. On the erection of the Diocese of Hamilton in 1856, the community became a separate diocesan congregation, and a few months later a novitiate was established at Hamilton. By the passage of the Separate Schools Bill in 1856 the sisters were given control of the education of the Catholic children of the city. The congregation gradually extended its activities to other parts of the diocese. The Neighbour to Neighbour Program, St. Joseph’s Women’s Immigrant Centre and Hamilton Out of the Cold are but three more recent (25 years) local initiatives where the Sisters have been instrumental in the start-up.\n\nIn 2019, there were fewer than twenty sisters living at the Motherhouse in Hamilton. It was sold to Columbia International College. The sisters are expected to maintain a small amount of office space. Some have moved to other motherhouses, and the rest to a Burlington retirement villa.\n\nThe community of Sisters of St. Joseph at London was founded in 1868 by five sisters from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto. These sisters opened an orphan asylum the following year in 1867. On 18 December 1870, the congregation became independent, with a novitiate of its own. Sister Ignatia Campbell was appointed Superior General in 1870 and held office until 1902. On 15 February 1871, the Sisters of St. Joseph of London, Ontario, were legally incorporated. Several missions were opened in various parts of the diocese, and in 1888 a hospital was established at London, to which was attached a training school for nurses.\n\nIn 1890, at the request of Bishop R.A. O'Connor, Bishop of Peterborough, twenty sisters of the Toronto congregation formed a new congregation in the diocese of Peterborough. Mother Austin Doran was elected General Superior. The sisters staffed the newly opened St. Joseph’s Hospital in Peterborough. In 1895 the congregation began its teaching apostolate in the city of Peterborough. A House of Providence was established in 1900 to accommodate not only the elderly poor but orphans of the diocese. In 2012, there were eighty sisters in the Peterborough community. \n\nIn 1921, in response to a request from Bishop Ryan for teachers to staff the rural areas of the Ottawa Valley schools, twenty-seven Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough from three mission houses located in the diocese of Pembroke, formed into a new congregation with the motherhouse in Pembroke. In 1946, they opened their first hospitals and Homes for the Aged in western Canada. By 1964, they were able to establish a mission in Peru which is still operating today with a growing community of Peruvian Sisters. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Pembroke sponsor the Stillpoint House of Prayer In January 2020, the Pembroke convent was for sale and the eight remaining sisters preparing to move to a local retirement residence.\n\nIn 1936 120 Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough became founding members of the new congregation in the diocese of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Saint-Vallier were instituted in 1683 at Saint-Vallier, France, by the Abbey of Saint-Vallier, who would later become Quebec City’s second bishop. They had originally been part of the large Congregation of St. Joseph that was founded in 1650 at Puy en Velay. Upon the creation of their order, the Sisters took charge of the small hospital in Saint-Vallier. The congregation survived the French Revolution because of its small size and state of destitution. But the Combes Laws (1901 and 1904) closed the schools of the religious communities and forbade the sisters from teaching. One sister who had come from Quebec, Thérèse de Jésus (Cécile Drolet), suggested to the Mother General that the congregation find a new home in Canada. She was sent to Quebec City in April 1903 and presented a request to Monsignor Bégin, who approved the congregation’s move to his diocese.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061291", "title": "Wongai ningaui", "text": "Wongai ningaui\n\nWongai ningaui, a common name of Ningaui ridei, is a tiny carnivorous marsupial native to the arid open grasslands of inland Australia. Their diet is mainly small insects, and occasionally larger prey such as spiders, grasshoppers and cockroaches, which they forage for at the ground and in clumps of spinifex. They have long and untidy fur, grey or gingery brown with longer black hairs, small ears, a narrow muzzle, and possess a partially prehensile tail and feet that allow them to climb. The population occurs sparsely across a wide area and common in favourable habitat, especially in years of good rainfall. \"Ningaui ridei\" was first described in 1975, one of two species of a new genus discovered amongst the poorly known mammals of the western regions of Australia.\n\n\"Ningaui ridei\" and the Pilbara species, \"Ningaui timealeyi\", were two species of \"Ningaui\" described by Australian biologist Mike Archer when the genus was erected in 1975 (the southern species, \"Ningaui yvonneae\", would be described in 1983), although the Pilbara ningaui was designated the type species. The Wongai ningaui was described from two subadult specimens collected near Laverton in Western Australia. The scientific name of this species honours the Australian naturalist W. D. L. Ride, who recognised the paraphyly of specimens that had been assigned to \"Planigale\", including some that Archer placed with the new species.\n\nThe common name Wongai ningaui was recognised in the 2001 census of Australian vertebrates, the species is also referred to Ride's ningaui.\n\nA species of \"Ningaui\". with a combined head and body length of 58 to 75 millimetres, tail length of 60 to 70 mm and weight range of 6.5 to 10.5 grams. The females present 6 to 8 teats. The appearance of the pelage is spiky and dishevelled, with grey hair mixed with brown or ginger; the obvious guard hairs are black. The ears do not extend far above the fur at the crown of the head, the eyes are close set and relatively small, and their face narrows at the muzzle. A gingery colour appears at the side of the head and at the lower parts of the ears.\nFlanks are a yellow-grey colour, and the ventral side is whitish.\n\n\"Ningaui ridei\" occurs with the superficially similar species \"Ningaui yvonneae\" in a narrow overlap of their distribution range west of Kalgoorlie, they may be distinguished in the field by the length of the first toe. \nThe first toe of the hindfoot is level with the interdigital pads at the lower surface, a diagnosis that separates this species from the shorter toe of \"N. yvonneae\".\n\nEven smaller than a house mouse, the Wongai ningaui is greyish above and lighter below. It has a semi-prehensile tail, needle sharp teeth and a long snout. The name \"ningaui\" derives from an Aboriginal word for tiny mythological beings that are hairy, have short feet and only come out at night.\nNingauis use their sharp teeth to kill their insect prey by swiftly biting them around the head. They hunt by night and rest among the spinnifex hummocks by day. The females have as many as five to seven young, the breeding season beginning in October.\n\nThe Wongai ningaui lives mostly in the interior of Australia, on dunes or sandplains that have spinifex, or grasslands and occasional trees such as acacias, desert oaks and mulga, Australian Cypress Pine and arid heathland plants. The distribution range begins west of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia across northern South Australia and southern Northern Territory to southwestern Queensland. They are sparsely distributed but may be locally common.\nThe population decreases if annual rainfall is low.\n\nA solitary and nocturnal animal that resides in hummocks of \"Triodia\", or within a log, or tunnel just below the ground. They forage for invertebrates, most of which are insects less than ten millimetres, but may pursue larger prey such as spiders, grasshoppers and cockroaches. When conditions are unsuitable the species is able to reduce its requirements by entering a state of torpor. The litter size is five to seven young, these remain at a nest site until six weeks and gain independence by thirteen weeks; only a few young survive to reproduce in the next season. The female bears young during September to October and may rear a second litter in the same year.\n\nThe IUCN \"Red List\" assessed the conservation status of the species in 2015 as least concern, with a population that is unlikely to be in decline and not meeting the criteria of a greater threat of extinction. \"Ningaui ridei\" is found within protected areas and conservation reserves in parts of its distribution range.\nRegional authorities, in Queensland and the Northern Territory, also list this species by the conservation status least concern.\n\n"}

Its headquarter is New Delhi Baroda House near India Gate.\n\nOfficially notified as a new railway zone on 14 April 1952, its origin goes back to 3 March 1859.\n\nOn 14 April 1952, the Northern Railway zone was created by merging Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway, Eastern Punjab Railway and three divisions of the East Indian Railway north-west of Mughalsarai (Uttar Pradesh).\n\nOn 3 March 1859, Allahabad-Kanpur, the first passenger railway line in North India was opened, which falls under Northern Railway zone.\n\nIn 1864, a broad gauge track from Calcutta to Delhi was laid.\n\nIn 1864, the railway line between Old Delhi and Meerut City railway station was constructed. Meerut Cantt railway station was established by British India government around 1865 after the sepoy mutiny of 1857.\n\nIn 1866, through trains started running on the East Indian Railway Company’s Howrah-Delhi line.\nIn 1870, the Sind, Punjab and Delhi railway completed the long Amritsar - Ambala - Jagadhri- Saharanpur - Ghaziabad line connecting Multan (now in Pakistan) with Delhi.\n\nIn 1872, Sarai Rohilla railway station was established when the metre gauge railway line from Delhi to Jaipur and Ajmer was being laid. It was a small station just outside Delhi as Delhi was confined to walled city then. All the metre gauge trains starting from (and terminating at) Delhi to Rewari, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat passed through this station. The track from Delhi to Sarai Rohilla was double. The single track from Sarai Rohilla to Rewari was doubled up to Rewari, from where single tracks diverged in five directions.\n\nIn 1876, metre gauge track from Delhi to Rewari and further to Ajmer was laid in 1873 by Rajputana State Railway.\n\nIn 1879, the Sind, Punjab and Delhi railway completed the Amritsar–Ambala–Saharanpur–Ghaziabad line connecting Multan (now in Pakistan) with Delhi.\n\nIn 1884, the Rajputana-Malwa Railway extended the wide metre gauge Delhi-Rewari line to Bathinda. The Bathinda-Rewari metre gauge line was converted to wide broad gauge in 1994.\n\nOn 9 March 1885, the first train ran from Jodhpur Junction railway station to Luni. The New Jodhpur Railway was later combined with Bikaner Railway to form Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway in 1889. A Railway line was completed between Jodhpur and Bikaner in 1891. Later in 1900, it combined with Jodhpur-Hyderabad Railway (some part of this railway is in Pakistan) leading to connection with Hyderabad of Sindh Province. Later in 1924 Jodhpur and Bikaner Railways worked as independent Railways. After Independence, a part of Jodhpur Railway went to West Pakistan.\n\nIn 1891, the Delhi-Panipat-Ambala-Kalka line was opened.\n\nIn 1891, the Delhi-Panipat-Ambala-Kalka line was opened The wide narrow gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway was constructed by Delhi-Panipat-Ambala-Kalka Railway Company and opened for traffic in 1903. In 1905 the line was regauged to wide narrow gauge.\n\nIn 1897, the Southern Punjab Railway Co. opened the Delhi-Bhatinda-Samasatta line in 1897. The line passed through Muktasar and Fazilka tehsils and provided direct connection through Samma Satta (now in Pakistan) to Karachi.\n\nIn 1900, the present building of the Delhi Junction railway station was built with 2 platforms and opened for public in 1903.\n\nIn 1900, the Ghaziabad-Moradabad link was established by Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\nIn 1901-02, the metre gauge Jodhpur-Bikaner line was extended to Bathinda by Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. It was subsequently converted to broad gauge.\n\nIn 1904 the Agra-Delhi line was opened. Six railway lines then entered Delhi. East Indian Railway, North-Western Railway, and Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway entered from Ghaziabad crossing the Yamuna river. Delhi - Sonipat Junction railway station - Panipat - Ambala Cantonment - Kalka Railway ran northwards from Delhi, and the Rajputana-Malwa Railway traversed the Delhi district for a short distance in the direction of Gurgaon and Rewari Junction. Delhi Railway Station was built in red stone to give the effect of nearby historic Red Fort. The station building had six clock towers and tower 4 is still in use as a water tank. The station was remodelled in 1934–35, when its platforms were extended and power signals were introduced. A new entrance from Kashmere Gate side was created in 1990s and new platforms were added. The platforms were renumbered in September 2011. The numbers that started from Kashmere Gate entrance as 1A and ended at 18 near the main entrance were renumbred starting as 1 from the main entrance and ending at 16 at Kashmere Gate entrance and some platforms were merged to form long platforms to accommodate trains of 24 coaches. The station building was renovated in 2012-13. Delhi earlier handled both broad and meter gauge trains. Since 1994, it is a purely broad gauge station, meter gauge traffic having been shifted to Delhi Sarai Rohilla Station.\n\nIn 1926, New Delhi railway station opened ahead of the inauguration of the New Delhi as city in 1931. Agra-Delhi railway track cut through the site earmarked for the hexagonal War Memorial (now called India Gate) and Kingsway (now called Rajpath). East Indian Railway Company shifted the line along the Yamuna river and opened the new track in 1924. Before the new imperial capital New Delhi was established after 1911, the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city and the Agra-Delhi railway line cut through what is today called \"Lutyens' Delhi\" and the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (now \"India Gate\") and Kingsway (now \"Rajpath\"). The railway line was shifted along Yamuna river and opened in 1924 to make way for the new capital. Minto (now \"Shivaji\") and Hardinge (now \"Tilak\") rail bridges came up for this realigned line. The East Indian Railway Company, that overlooked railways in the region, sanctioned the construction of a single story building and a single platform between Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj in 1926. This was later known as New Delhi Railway station. The government's plans to have the new station built inside the Central Park of Connaught Place was rejected by the Railways as it found the idea impractical. In 1927–28, New Delhi Capital Works project involving construction of of new lines was completed. The Viceroy and royal retinue entered the city through the new railway station during the inauguration of New Delhi in 1931. New structures were added to the railway station later and the original building served as the parcel office for many years.\n\nIn 1975-76 The Tundla-Aligarh-Ghaziabad trackwas electrified.\n\nIn 1976-77, the Ghaziabad-Nizamuddin-New Delhi-Delhi track was electrified.\n\nOn 1 July 1987, Ambala railway division was created by transferring 639 km tracks from Delhi Division and 348 km from Firozpur Division, and it became completely operational from 15 August 1988. 62% its are lies Punjab and the rest in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chandigarh. It has 141 stations, including UNESCO World Heritage Kalka Shimla Railway.\n\nIn 1992-1995, Sabjimandi-Panipat-Karnal sector was electrified.\n\nIn 1994 December, the Delhi-Rewari railway line had double metre gauge tracks and one of the tracks was converted to broad gauge as a part of conversion of Ajmer-Delhi line. Within a few years, both the tracks from Sarai Rohilla to Delhi railway station were converted to broad gauge and all metre gauge trains stopped operating from Delhi station.\n\nIn 1998-99, Ambala-Chandigarh sector was electrified.\n\nIn 1999-2000, Chandigarh-Kalka.\n\nIn 2003, Anand Vihar Terminal railway station's was announced as new station to be built, foundation stone laid on 25 January 2004. construction commenced in October 2006, and opened on 20 October 2009. The city of Delhi heavily depends on the Rail transport to cater for the increasing load of passengers to their destinations. The long-distance trains from Delhi used to ply from three stations namely Delhi Junction (Old Delhi), New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Stations. These stations lacked the infrastructure facilities to handle such high passenger rush. Also, Delhi is the connecting station for the cities in the Northern states Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir. With increasing passenger pressure at the existing stations, the requirement of additional major passenger terminals was identified by the Northern Railways. The East-bound trains from Delhi to the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand West Bengal and other North-eastern states had to cross the bridge over River Yamuna as all the three stations are located on the other side of the river. Thus, the area of Anand Vihar was selected in the trans-Yamuna region to construct a mega-railway terminal. \nIn 2010-11 Rail Budget, Panipat-Meerut line 104 km survey was announced and the project implementation was approved in 2017-18 budget with an outlay of INR948 crore.\n\nIn 2013, Chandigarh-Sahnewal line (also referred to as Ludhiana-Chandigarh rail link) was inaugurated.\n\nIn 2013, the foundation stone for the shifting of Rohtak-Makrauli section of Rohtak- Gohana- Panipat line was laid.\n\nIn May 2013, a tender was awarded to enable free Wi-Fi connectivity at the new Delhi railway station, at an approximate cost of and service became functional later in the year.\n\nBy September 2006, the second metre gauge track from Sarai Rohilla to Rewari was also converted to broad gauge and all metre gauge trains stopped operating between Rewari and Sarai Rohilla (though the converted track was opened for public use only in October 2007).\n\nIn 2015 to 2016, work of doubling of Ghaziabad-Meerut-Khatauli(Muzaffarnagar) Section of Meerut-Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur tracks was completed\n\nIn January 2016, the Ghaziabad-Moradabad line was completely electrified. The Ghaziabad-Meerut-Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur-Roorkee-Haridwar line is also open to electric trains with effect from March 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Vivaan Solar, a Gwalior based company won the contract to install 2.2 MW of rooftop solar project at the Delhi Junction railway station in late 2016. The solar power project to be set up under Public Private Partnership will be executed on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis. The company will also be responsible for maintenance of the plant for a period of 25 years.\n\nIn 2016-17 Rail Budget, Yamunanagar-chandigarh line re-survey for this INR875 crore line was announced at the cost of INR 25 crore.\n\nIn 2017-18, Indian Railway approved Panipat-Jind line and Panipat-Rohtak line electrification for Rs 980 crore and new rail line Panipat-Shamli-Baghpat-Meerut for Rs 2200 crore.\n\nIn 2017 December, National Capital Region Transport Corporation signed agreements with Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (Spain's state owned company) and Société nationale des chemins de fer français (France's state owned company) to cooperate on the development of rapid rail smart projects, including Delhi-Meerut Smart Line, Delhi-Panipat Smart Line and Delhi-Alwar Smart Line have been prioritised for implementation in the first phase of NCR RRTS where these three lines will operate from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. Designed with 180 kmph design speed, 160 kmph operational speed, and 100 kmph average speed, of six-car trains carrying 1,154 passengers running every 5 to 10 minutes on either underground or elevated point-to-point tracks where passengers will not have to change trains. 35-40% funding will be equity from Centre and state governments and the remaining 60% will come from multilateral funding agencies. In 2017 December, National Capital Region Transport Corporation signed agreements with Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (Spain's state owned company) and Société nationale des chemins de fer français (France's state owned company) to cooperate on the development of rapid rail smart projects, including Delhi-Meerut Smart Line, Delhi-Panipat Smart Line and Delhi-Alwar Smart Line have been prioritised for implementation in the first phase of NCR RRTS where these three lines will operate from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. NCRTC has commissioned a traffic pattern study by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) that will determine rote and the design of stations depending on the traffic. INR32,598 crore Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS will be implemented first, ground clearance is underway in December 2017, construction will commence by June 2018 and completed by 2024, for which pre-construction activities including geo-technical investigations, detailed design, utility-shifting planning and traffic diversion planning are in progress. INR 30,000 crore Delhi-Panipat Smart Line and 180.5 km will cost around Rs 37,539 crore Delhi-Alwar Smart Line are awaiting DPR approval, construction to commence by the end of 2018 and completed before 2025. Delhi-Alwar line will have 19 stations, 9 underground stations from ISBT Kashmere Gate to Kherki Daula and 10 elevated stations on 124.5 km route.\n\nBy December 2017, railways for the first time installed 6,095 GPS-enabled \"Fog Pilot Assistance System\" railway signalling devices in four most affected zones, Northern Railway zone, North Central Railway zone, North Eastern Railway zone and North Western Railway zone, by doing away with the old practice of putting firecrackers on train tracks to alter tran divers running trains on snail's pace. With these devices, train pilots precisely know in advance, about the location of signals, level-crossing gates and other such approaching markers.\n9\n\nThe Zonal Headquarters Office of Northern Railways is at Baroda House, New Delhi, and five divisional headquarters are located at:\n\nThe first passenger railway line in North India opened from Allahabad to Kanpur on 3 March 1859. This was followed in 1889, by the Delhi–Panipat-Ambala–Kalka line. Northern Railways previously consisted of eight divisional zones: Allahabad, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Delhi, Moradabad, Ferozpur, Ambala, and Lucknow, spanning most of North India. With the re-organisation of zones by the Indian Railways, Northern Railway zone came to its present form on 14 April 1952 and it now consists of five divisional zones.\n\nOn 19 February 1986, Northern Railways was the first zone to introduce the computerized passenger reservation system and was the first zone to do so. To facilitate the Unreserved travellers to also plan their journey ahead, Northern Railway introduced the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) whereby the unreserved rail passenger can purchase an unreserved ticket three days in advance from the current booking counters.\n\nThe first diesel and electric locomotive simulators in India at the Tughlaqabad and Kanpur locomotive sheds were introduced by Northern Railways. These help upgrading the skills of the working and new drivers, providing them training for high-speed train operation. All workshops, Diesel sheds and Air brake freight departments are ISO 9000 certified. Diesel shed, Tughlaqabad has the distinction of being the first diesel shed to get ISO 14000 certification on the Indian Railway.\n\nThere are eight workshops operated by Northern Railways\n\nZonal Railway Training Institute (ZRTI) at Chandausi, Moradabad UP is the oldest (and North India's only) Railway Training Institute, where group C railway employees like Driver, Guard, Ticket Checker, Station Master, Traffic Inspector, Commercial Inspector, JE (signal & Telecom) etc. are trained for initial, promotional and refresher courses. ZRTI is an ISO 9001 Institute. Applicants pass All India Railway Examinations to get admission into the institute. ZRTI is headed by a senior Civil Services Officer.\n\n\nNorthern Railways is one of nine old zones of Indian Railways and also the biggest in terms of network having 6807 kilometre route. It covers the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and the Union territories of Delhi and Chandigarh.\n\nNorthern Railways implemented the Route Relay Interlocked system (RRI) at New Delhi Railway Station which is a modern signaling system for enhancing efficiency and safety in the operations. This Route Relay Interlocked system at New Delhi is one of the world's largest route relay interlocking system certified by the Guinness Book of Records. Northern Railway is equipped with 40 Route Relay Interlocking systems including the system at Delhi Main.\n\nDelhi Suburban Railway services is a commuter rail service operated by Northern Railway. It covers the city state of Delhi, along with the adjoining districts of Faridabad, Ghaziabad and other adjoining places in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. These services are mostly run using EMU and MEMU rakes. In 2009 Ladies Special trains were introduced between New Delhi and Palwal. Two more ladies special trains will be connecting from the city to Ghaziabad and Panipat.\n\nStarting with a part of Firozpur division of the Northern Railway zone, the line has been under construction since 1983; the Jammu Udhampur Srinagar Baramulla Railway Link (JUSBRL) of the Jammu–Baramulla line is under construction in perhaps the most difficult terrain on the Indian subcontinent. The Northern Railway reached another landmark achievement by extending rail services in the Kashmir Valley on 28 October 2009 by commencing rail services between Anantnag and Qazigund of the Qazigund-Baramula rail project. Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel, the 10.96 km long railway tunnel, passes through the Pir Panjal Range of middle Himalayas in Jammu and Kashmir. It is a part of its Udhampur–Srinagar–Baramulla rail link project, opened in October 2011, India's longest and Asia's second longest railway tunnel and reduced the distance between Quazigund and Banihal to only 11 km .\n\nNorthern Railways in keeping the objective to achieve the target under National Solar Mission to maximize the use of solar power selected Vivaan Solar, a Gwalior based company to install a total of five MW rooftop solar power project in 4 major railway stations of NCR namely Anand Vihar, New Delhi, Old Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin respectively. The Public Private Partnership to install rooftop solar project was signed in late 2016. The solar power project is to be executed on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis and expected to be operational by August 2017. The company will also be responsible for maintaining the respective solar power plants with break up of 1.1 MW, 1.1 MW, 2.2 MW, and 0.6 MW respectively for a period of 25 years.\n\n\n"}

In February 2017, the Bangalore - Hassan railway line via Shravanabelagola was completed.\n\nThe Mysuru Division of South Western Railways will be designated as \"Digital Division\" after fully adopting its current technology harnessing programme. Government of India had asked Railways divisions to cut red tape and reduce paper work in offices. All the officials will adopt technologies like WhatsApp and Google Drive to share reports and other documents. This will save lot of papers being used for circulating reports as done currently. Two web based helplines have been launched so that digitised information can be shared among different officials. The inspection reports regarding maintenance, passenger amenities, cleanliness, electronics and communication etc. will be managed by a new software which is under construction now. These measures will cut down redundant works, reduce number of registers and reports maintained by officials, reduce paper consumption and improve the efficiency and celerity of operations.\n\nSince 2007, the SWR is entirely Indian gauge. SWR has many WDG4, WAP-7, WAG9-HC and WDP4 locomotives currently based at diesel loco sheds Hubli and Krishnarajapuram.\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of seven, Blessitt became a Christian. He studied at Mississippi College and Golden Gate Baptist Seminary, but abandoned his studies to serve as a pastor in several Baptist churches across the US.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Blessitt began preaching in Hollywood, California. There he became known as the \"Minister of Sunset Strip\". In March 1968, he opened a coffee house called \"His Place\" in a rented building next door to a topless go-go club. It was there that he first made a big cross to hang on the wall of the building on the inside. He started carrying the cross on Sunset Strip from time to time.\n\nHis first marriage was to Sherry Anne Simmons, whom he married within three weeks of dating in 1963. Together they had six children: Gina, Arthur Joel, Joy, Arthur Joshua, Arthur Joseph and Arthur Jerusalem. Blessitt and Simmons divorced in 1990.\n\nHe married Denise Irja Brown later in 1990. Together, they adopted a child, Sophia, and now live in Denver, Colorado.\n\nArthur Blessitt made the cross in 1968 to hang on the wall of \"His Place\" on Sunset Strip, Hollywood, and made short cross walks in that area. On December 25, 1969, he began his journey with the cross, walking from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. Speaking of his inspiration for the walks, he said he \"heard the voice of Jesus calling him to walk to every nation.\" For a short while, from 1970 to 1971, he set up an evangelical outreach at New York's Times Square, which was similar to his Hollywood coffeehouse. In May 1971, Blessitt made his first overseas cross-walk, beginning in Northern Ireland.\n\nBlessitt has carried the cross to all parts of the world. During the Cold War, he carried his cross into the Soviet Union, through Russia, the Baltic States, Ukraine and other countries. He has carried the cross through such places as Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, China, South Africa, Lebanon, India, Antarctica, Palestine, Israel, Cuba, Libya, Northern and Southern Yemen, Vietnam and Mongolia.\n\nWhilst traveling, Blessitt has met numerous world and religious leaders including, George W. Bush, Billy Graham, Pope John Paul II, Yasser Arafat and Muammar al-Gaddafi. He was arrested 24 times and lost his cross twice.\n\nOn part of a cross walk through Beirut, Blessitt chose to bring his son Arthur Joshua.\n\nOn June 13, 2008, Arthur Blessitt walked his 38,102nd mile (61,319th km) in Zanzibar, completing the goal he had set for himself to walk to every \"country and island group\" in the world.\n\nAs of July 2019, Blessitt still partakes in cross walks globally. Blessitt claims to have covered over 43,000 miles (69,202 km) through 324 \"nations, island groups and territories\". He also claims to have traveled every ocean and walked on all seven continents (including Antarctica). Trinity Broadcast Network's PR Newswire claims that he is known internationally as the \"Pilgrim with the Cross\". He is featured in the \"Guinness World Records 2015\" for holding the record for Longest Around the World Ongoing Pilgrimage/Walk. \n\nBlessitt has been the subject of various documentaries, such as \"The Cross Museum of Arthur and Denise Blessitt\" (2014), \"Arthur: A Pilgrim\" (1988), and \"The Cross: The Arthur Blessitt Story\" (2009), directed by Matthew Crouch.\n\nBlessitt practices within the evangelical tradition of protestant Christianity, and sits within the Charismatic wing of that tradition. He lists R. T. Kendall and Charles Spurgeon as inspirations.\n\nBlessitt made a failed bid for the 1976 Democratic nomination for President. He withdrew from the contest after contesting the New Hampshire and Florida primaries. He polled fifth in Florida with 8171 votes.

Perrotta (born August 13, 1961) is an American novelist and screenwriter best known for his novels \"Election\" (1998) and \"Little Children\" (2004), both of which were made into critically acclaimed, Academy Award-nominated films. Perrotta co-wrote the screenplay for the 2006 film version of \"Little Children\" with Todd Field, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. He is also known for his novel \"The Leftovers\" (2011), which has been adapted into a TV series on HBO.\n\nTom Perrotta was born in Newark, New Jersey and raised in Garwood, New Jersey, where he spent his entire childhood, and was raised Roman Catholic. His father was an Italian immigrant postal worker, whose parents emigrated from a village near Avellino, Campania, and his mother is an Albanian-Italian immigrant former secretary, who stayed home to raise him along with his older brother and younger sister. Perrotta enjoyed reading authors such as O. Henry, J. R. R. Tolkien, and John Irving, and decided early in his life that he wanted to be a writer. He was involved in his high school literary magazine, \"Pariah\", for which he wrote several short stories. Perrotta earned a B.A. in English from Yale University in 1983, and then received an M.A. in English/Creative Writing from Syracuse University. While at Syracuse, Perrotta was a pupil of Tobias Wolff, whom Perrotta later praised for his \"comic writing and moral seriousness.\"\n\nPerrotta married writer Mary Granfield in 1991, and lives in the Boston suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile teaching Creative Writing at Yale, Perrotta completed three novels that he had trouble getting published. One was \"Election\", the story of an intense high-school election inspired by the three-candidate 1992 United States presidential race, and another was \"Lucky Winners\", which remains unpublished as of 2007 and which Perrotta described in 2004 as \"a pretty good novel about a family that falls apart after winning the lottery.\" In 1994, Perrotta published his first book, a collection of short stories titled \"Bad Haircut: Stories of the Seventies\" which \"The Washington Post\" called \"more powerful than any other coming-of-age novel.\" The same year, Perrotta left Yale and began teaching expository writing at Harvard University. In 1997 he published \"The Wishbones\", his first novel, which Perrotta has said is basically \"about my high school years.\" The unpublished manuscript of \"Election\" was optioned as a screenplay in 1996 by director Alexander Payne, which then led to interest in publishing it as a book. It arrived in bookstores in March 1998, followed shortly by its film adaptation, which was released in April 1999 to critical acclaim. The film, which starred Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, helped popularize Perrotta as an author.\n\nFollowing \"Election\", Perrotta shifted his focus to an older—though just as troubled—cast of characters: first with 2000's \"Joe College\", a comic journey into the dark side of higher education, love, and food service (which the author says is about his college years); and then with 2004's \"Little Children\", which explored the psychological and romantic depths beneath the surface of suburbia.\n\n\"Little Children\" was Perrotta's \"breakout book,\" featured on numerous \"Best Books of 2004\" lists—including those of \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"Newsweek\", National Public Radio, and \"People\" magazine—and garnering tremendous praise for Perrotta. \"The New York Times\" dubbed him \"an American Chekhov whose characters even at their most ridiculous seem blessed and ennobled by a luminous human aura,\" and \"People\" called him \"the rare writer equally gifted at drawing people's emotional maps...and creating sidesplitting scenes.\" For his part, Perrotta describes himself as a writer in the \"plain-language American tradition\" of authors such as Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver.\n\nIn 2006, Perrotta sold New Line Cinema an original screenplay he co-wrote with \"Frasier\" producer Rob Greenberg. Titled \"Barry and Stan Gone Wild\", the screenplay is \"a shameless comedy [about] a 40-something dermatologist who goes on spring break.\" In January 2007, Perrotta was on the guest faculty for the third annual Writers in Paradise conference at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. Perrotta was invited to teach at Eckerd by Dennis Lehane; the two writers had previously taught together at Stonecoast Writers Conference in Maine.\n\nPerrotta's novel, \"The Abstinence Teacher\", was published on October 16, 2007. It is, according to the author, \"all about sex education and the culture wars. It's close in spirit to \"Little Children\", I think.\" It was chosen by \"The New York Times\" as a 2007 Notable Book of the Year. As of October 2007, he was working on a film adaptation of the book with \"Little Miss Sunshine\" directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.\n\nIn 2010, 30,000 copies of his short story \"The Smile on Happy Chang's Face\" were distributed as part of the Boston Book Festival's \"One City, One Story\" project.\n\nHe has participated in turning his novel \"The Leftovers\" into an HBO TV series of the same name that began running in 2014 to critical acclaim for three seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Revesby is bounded on the north by Canterbury Road and the suburbs of Bankstown and Condell Park, on the south by Revesby Heights and Picnic Point, on the Georges River, on the west by Panania, and on the east by Padstow.\n\nRevesby was named in 1913 in honour of Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist who sailed with Captain James Cook on the Endeavour, when he reached the east coast of Australia in 1770. Banks had inherited his father’s estate of Revesby Abbey, in Lincolnshire, England, so he was known as the Squire of Revesby. He is also commemorated in the Sir Joseph Banks High School in Turvey Street.\n\nGeorge Johnston, an officer of marines who had arrived on the First Fleet was granted land in this area in 1804. His wife Esther Julian, who had arrived as a convict on the same ship in 1788 was granted in 1813. The earliest landowners did not reside in the area. The only mansion built in the early days was 'The Pah' on Tompson Road. It was built in 1896-97 by Samuel John Hales on that had been purchased from the Weston estate. The property was subdivided in 1926 but the house remains. \n\nThe first school opened as Bankstown South in 1896; now known as Revesby Public School. The railway station opened on 21 December 1931. The local post office opened in 1955.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 14,176 people in Revesby.\n\nRevesby has a growing retail shopping centre, adjacent to Revesby railway station, centred on Marco Avenue and Selems Parade. It is also the site of several local government facilities including a senior citizens centre.\n\nThe Revesby shopping village is home to many banks, specialty retailers, restaurants and cafés. In the early 2000s, one of the largest Woolworths supermarkets in Sydney was built in Marco Avenue, across the road from the existing complex. On the original site, a combined residential and retail development called Revesby Abbey was completed in 2003. These developments brought a major increase in shoppers and business to the area. Revesby Abbey is now a popular spot for people to meet as it features many cafes, restaurants and boutiques lining the street.\n\nA major attraction of Revesby is the Revesby Workers' Club. Originally opened in 1962, today it has over 50,000 members, with extensive modern facilities. The most recent upgrades were completed in 2000, with further extensions currently under construction expected to significantly change the club, making it one of the largest in the state. The recent addition of a multi-level car park as well as another supermarket in close proximity has greatly increased access for locals for entertainment and products.\n\nAn Arts and Crafts Fair is held every month at Abel Reserve.\n\nRevesby railway station is on the Airport & South Line of the Sydney Trains network. During the morning and afternoon peak, express services run via Sydenham and Redfern.\n\nRevesby is serviced by buses operated by Transdev NSW, generally following the routes established by McVicar's Bus Services.\n\n\nA campus of the Western Sydney University is in the neighbouring suburb of Milperra. Technical and Further Education (TAFE) courses are available at the nearby suburbs of Bankstown and Padstow.\n\nFor federal elections, Revesby is in the federal electoral division of Banks, held by David Coleman, of the Liberal Party of Australia. He has held it since the 2013 federal election. The seat was held continuously by Labor from proclamation in 1949 until the 2013 federal election.\n\nFor NSW state elections, Revesby is predominantly in the state electoral district of East Hills.

It is headquartered at Hajipur and comprises Sonpur, Samastipur, Danapur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, and Dhanbad divisions.\n\nFirst set up on 8 September 1996 with Headquarters at Hajipur, Bihar, East Central Railway became operational on 1stOctober 2002 by carving out areas from Eastern and North Eastern Railway zones currently consists of the divisions viz. Dhanbad, Danapur, Mughalsarai of Eastern Railway and Sonpur and Samastipur of North Eastern Railway. The last 13 years of its existence has been full of challenges and every obstacle was dealt in a dedicated manner despite constraints of work force and infrastructure. ECR, has a vast network of 5402.693 track kilometers and 3707.988 route kilometers encompassing the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Out of 3707.988 Route km, 1572.202 km have been electrified. ECR has been lifeline for the people in its expanse and is playing a pivotal role in rapid development of the area. The development of infrastructure has been the major thrust area to bring about a rapid growth rate in the region and prosperity to the people. In the field of construction of new lines, doubling, gauge conversion, construction of bridges/road-over bridges, new workshop projects, Other than this qualitative and perceptible improvement in safety, cleanliness, catering, passenger amenities have been achieved to a large extent. ECR is unique in the sense that both Goods loading and Passenger traffic assume great importance in view of the huge coal loading in the coal bearing of Dhanbad division of Jharkhand state and densely populated area of Bihar. The rapid growth in both the sectors has necessitated strengthening of infrastructure of Railways. Further ECR also has uniqueness of acting as a gateway to Nepal with International traffic catering to the movement of export traffic and passengers to Nepal and vice versa.\n\nThis Railway has carried 2159.08 lakh passengers in the year up to January 2015. With the running of regular express trains and passenger trains per day, besides special trains during the period April 2014 to January 2015, better traffic facilities has provided to passengers. With the increase of 5.78%, East Central Railway has registered a significant increase under gross earnings by 9774.21 crore as compared to the corresponding month of last year i.e. 9240.17 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamastipur Workshop was established in the year 1881 for overhauling of Steam locomotives, POH of coaches and wagons. It was remodelled in 1962 for manufacture of MG wagons. In 1993, manufacturing of BOXN wagons started @1 wagon per month, in addition to the existing activity of wagon POH. POH activity of MG wagons was discontinues in June 1996 and since then this workshop is primarily engaged in production of BOXN wagons. The manufacturing of BOXNHS wagons started in June 2002. At present, the workshop is engaged in manufacturing of Stainless Steel BOXNHL wagons.\n\nECR had no carriage repair workshop and was totally dependent on ER and NER. In order to be self-reliant and improve efficiency, workshop for overhauling of 50 coaches per month has been set up at Harnaut on Bakhtiyarpur-Rajgir section of Danapur division of East Central Railway. The workshop is spread over 75 acres of land and there is scope for future expansion. The workshop was taken over by ECR on 15 June 2012, and since then it has carried out POH of 367 Non-AC ICF coaches. Its present outturn is 25 coaches per month. The workshop is expected to reach its installed capacity in 2015–16 and in future there is plan to repair air-conditioned coaches as well.\n\nAt present there a rail link to connect North and South Bihar near Patna. In the entire east to west stretch of about 445 km of river Ganga in Bihar, there is a rail-cum road bridge at Varanasi and then the downstream if we go the nearest Rail link across river Ganga is available at Sonepur-Patliputra Rail cum road bridge, at Mokama (Rajendra Bridge) which is 318 km from Varanasi. The Mokama rail link is already saturated and has become a major bottleneck for increasing the number of trains between North and South Bihar. This has been a great hindrance in the industrialization of North Bihar and Nepal, which have become the important trade centre for consumable goods. Construction of Rail-cum-Road Bridge will remove the bottle-neck and both parts of Bihar will be connected by more number of trains. Trade centers of North Bihar will also be connected with the rest part of Bihar. Power houses at Barauni and Kanti who are under going expansion in North Bihar shall also be benefitted due to lessened congestion. Hence this Rail cum Road bridge shall act as a lifeline for Bihar. The work of Ganga Rail Bridge at Patna was included in 1997–98 when the proposal was only for the Rail bridge but in 2006–07 the scope was increased to Rail cum Road Bridge. It is the longest Rail cum Road bridge. The dilapidated condition of the only road bridge connecting North and South Bihar in Patna (Mahatma Gandhi Setu), warrants for immediate arrangement of alternate road bridge. Understanding the problem, in the year 2005, in September 2006 scope of the project was enlarged and Rail bridge was converted into Rail cum Road bridge. The bridge will be 2nd longest Rail-cum-Road Bridge in India with total length of 4556m. The bridge consists of 38 spans. The proposed Road of the bridge is connecting NH-31 of North Bihar to NH-80 of South Bihar. Gladly, work on all the 38 Spans of this mega structure has been completed by December 2014. The construction of bridge has been completed by 2016 end.\nAnd it was inaugurated by the Honourable Prime Minister of India in March 2016.\n\nNo road bridge across River Ganges is available between Mokama and Bhagalpur for a distance of about 206 km. The only rail link available across river Ganga in Bihar is Rajendra Bridge at Mokama. Similar is the situation for Road Bridge also. Rail-cum-Road Bridge at Munger has a revised cost of Rs. 2363 crore, in which Rs. 1116 crore share with State Government and Rs. 1247 crore share with Railway. Rail link of the bridge is connecting Jamalpur station of Sahebganj loop (Maldah Division) of Eastern Railway to Sahebpurkamal station (Barauni-Katihar section) of East Central Railway. The bridge is 3190 m long. All the 31 spans of this bridge have been completed by December 2014. It is hopes that the construction of the complete bridge will be completed by 2015–16.\n\nIn the year 1887, a meter gauge rail link between Nirmali and Bhaptiahi (Saraigarh) was provided by the Bengal North West Railway. Due to severe Ino-Nepal earthquake in 1934 this rail link washed away in heavy flood owing to meandering nature of river Kosi, no attempt was made to restore this link for a long period. The Kosi Rail Bridge project included in the budget in the year 2003–04 at an estimated cost of Rs. 323 Crore. After the construction of Kosi Rail Bridge, the distance between Nirmali and Saraigarh will get reduced to 20.5 km from present 299 km. It will provide an alternative BG route of length 610 km between Gorakhpur and Katihar against the existing route of 505 km via Chapra and Barauni, which at present is a highly saturated corridor. This project gained exceptional significance as the East West Corridor from Muzaffarpur to Purnia (NH 57) of NHAI shares the same location for crossing the river. The bridge is 1780m long with 39 spans.\n\nThis bridge was constructed during the year 1898. Due to introduction of clause of MBG-1987 loading, the existing bridge became the major constraint and necessitated the construction of a new alternate bridge. Traffic on this route will increase considerably when the third line between Dehri-On-Sone and Mughalsarai will become operational. The New Sone Bridge between Dehri-on-Sone and Sonenagar which has been successfully commissioned on 16 August 2014, will prove a great help in this regard.\n\nA new second bridge on river Gandak has been opened (5.5 km) between Sonpur and Hajipur for double line traffic for this section.\n\n\n"}

A hulking albino man with filed teeth, Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in New York City. He is primarily an enemy of Spider-Man and Daredevil, and the father of Janice Lincoln.\n\nThe character has appeared in various media including two animated series (\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" and \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\"), and the animated film \"\" with his voice provided by Marvin \"Krondon\" Jones III.\n\nThe character was created by Gerry Conway and Alex Saviuk and first appeared in \"Web of Spider-Man\" #36 (March 1988). The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man supporting character Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson, and was brought on as a regular in \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\", which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: \"My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren't central to \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on Aunt May or Mary Jane, or even J. Jonah Jameson, but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster Hammerhead had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it.\"\n\nBorn as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in Harlem, in New York City, he started out as troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was Harlem's only African-American albino. Taller and stronger than the other children, he became a school bully, extorting protection money from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson, was going to run a story on Lonnie's activities, but pulled it when Lonnie used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lonnie allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and he turned to a life of serious crime. As a hitman and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a vampire. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over twenty years whilst Lincoln became a powerful mob enforcer, killing many others.\n\nNow known as \"Tombstone\" on the street, he returned to New York City as the Kingpin's hitman. Tombstone threw the Hobgoblin out of the Arranger's window. Tombstone captured a mutant known as the Persuader for the Arranger. Lonnie returned to Robertson's neighborhood. Eventually Robertson went to the police which resulted in Tombstone's incarceration, but not before Tombstone confronted and seriously injured Robertson, nearly permanently damaging Robertson's spine. Tombstone then encountered Spider-Man in Atlanta, Georgia; Tombstone was defeated and sent to the Philadelphia State Penitentiary.\n\nRobertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewsiburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was incarcerated. In prison, Tombstone killed Robertson's befriended bodyguard Bruiser. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by Spider-Man; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River. Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone joined a criminal organization, headed by Hammerhead and the Chameleon, and then saved Robertson from Hobgoblin so that he could kill Robertson himself. Robertson was then given a full pardon for helping recapture Tombstone.\n\nTombstone eventually gained a superhuman physical constitution. Tombstone encountered Robertson at the Osborn Chemical Plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone's bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude. Tombstone was later defeated by Daredevil and the Punisher while competing against Taskmaster in a real game of Assassin sponsored by the Hand.\n\nTombstone was hired by the Green Goblin to be part of the Spider-Man killing group, the Sinister Twelve, but was defeated.\n\nTombstone was hired by Lily Lucca to pretend he kidnapped Lily and to fight Daredevil, but Tombstone was beaten by Daredevil.\n\nTombstone joined the Hood's army of criminals. He later returned to pester Deadpool in the miniseries: \"Deadpool - Suicide Kings\".\n\nTombstone was with the Hood when he presents the Scorpion's costume to whichever low-level crook impresses him until the party is crashed by the Scorpion stealing the costume.\n\nDuring the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, Doctor Octopus invites Tombstone to join a supervillain team in exchange for some items. Later, Tombstone confronts Carlie Cooper. However, the police arrive and Tombstone escapes, but later doubles back to follow Cooper after discovering that Cooper knows who Menace really is. He corners Cooper, Mary Jane Watson and Menace, but Menace manages to knock him out by activating the Goblin glider and sending it crashing into him. The police soon arrive and take Tombstone away.\n\nIt is later revealed that Tombstone is the father of the new Beetle (Janice Lincoln). He was contacted by her daughter to help the Sinister Six out against Owl's men.\n\nTombstone has a battle with Spider-Man. During a police shootout Tombstone critically injured a friend of cop Yuri Watanabe, the fourth Wraith. Tombstone was set free by the judge as Tombstone saved his wife from cancer. However, Mister Negative supplied Watanabe with evidence of Tombstone having a hold on the judge, putting them both in prison. The judge was killed by a prisoner who worked for Tombstone. When Black Cat, an Inner Demon disguised as the Crime Master, and the Enforcers attempted a jail break, the Inner Demon shot Tombstone in the chest.\n\nAfter surviving the attempt on his life, Tombstone is later approached by Mr. Fish who warns him about Black Cat's gang targeting him and his criminal empire in the upcoming gang war in Harlem. Tombstone and Mr. Fish are later visited by Alex Wilder who talks about his father Geoffrey Wilder's family business as the two of them knew him back when he was still alive. He also tells Tombstone and Mr. Fish that he is starting a new incarnation of the Pride which he will start in Harlem. Afterwards, Alex Wilder beats up Tombstone and uses a magic spell to send Mr. Fish to Hell. After recovering from the attack, Tombstone rescues Mr. Fish from Hell with the help of Black Talon.\n\nDuring the \"Infinity Wars\" storyline, Tombstone is among the villains that accompany Turk Barrett to his meeting with the Infinity Watch at Central Park.\n\nDuring the \"Hunted\" storyline, Tombstone was seen as a patron at the Pop-Up with No Name.\n\nOriginally, Lonnie Lincoln had no superhuman powers, but has gained them through artificial means as a result of a mutagenic reaction to an experimental preservative gas absorbed into his bloodstream. He possesses physical strength that has been increased beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone's body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.\n\nAside from these advantages, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well connected in the underworld of organized crime.\n\nAs an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of melanin. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at OsCorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.\n\nTombstone has filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points.\n\nAn older version of Tombstone appears in the \"Spectacular Spider-Girl\" digital comic series, set in the MC2 universe. He had been paid by Silvermane to carry out a hit on Spider-Girl. Despite his advanced years, Tombstone still proved to be a tough opponent to defeat.\n\nHe met Spider-Girl and did battle with her. But when he saw another Spider-Girl saving people from a burning building on TV, Tombstone grew furious and rapidly finished her off. \n\nWhen Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage. Tombstone was surprised that she has symbiote powers and was defeated. At first thinking he will be on the streets again soon since he believes heroes cannot kill, the Blue Spider-Girl suffocates and kills him.\n\nTombstone (known as \"Lonnie the Tombstone\") appears in the Marvel MAX \"Cage\" mini-series. This version of the character has a less monstrous, more realistic appearance with pink skin, blond hair and normal teeth. He becomes embroiled in a brutal gang war with Sonny \"The Hammer\" Caputo and Clifford \"Clifto\" Townsend.\n\nTombstone appears in \"Luke Cage Noir\", as an albino Harlem crime lord.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Adventures\" reality, Tombstone is a hired muscle of the Torino crime family. After his fellow mobsters were arrested, Tombstone secretly stole Captain George Stacy's cellphone and lured Gwen Stacy to the subway where he sent the pictures he took of them to George. Spider-Man arrived telling him to get away from Gwen. Tombstone stated that he didn't abduct or harm Gwen and backed away without a fight. When Captain Stacy arrived to arrest Tombstone and his fellow mobsters, Spider-Man and Captain America arrived. It took the combination tactics of Spider-Man, Captain America, and Captain Stacy to defeat Tombstone.\n\nDuring the 2015 \"Secret Wars\" storyline, a version of Tombstone lives in the Battleworld domain of Arachnia. He and Carnage were stalked by Spider-Man Noir and was defeated by the Warriors of the Great Web.\n\n\nTombstone appears in \"\", voiced by Marvin \"Krondon\" Jones III. This version of the character is under the Kingpin's employ and acts as a personal bodyguard; he usually wields two pistols, but is shown to also be a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Tombstone is present when Kingpin unmasks and kills Spider-Man, before ordering Tombstone to dispose of the body. Later, Tombstone accompanies Kingpin and his other henchmen – Doctor Octopus, Scorpion, and Prowler – to attack the spider-people at May Parker's house, in order to retrieve the USB drive that can be used to stop the Alchemax Super Collider, which Kingpin plans to use to access different dimensions and reunite with an alternate version of his family, after they died in a car crash. In the final battle at the Collider, Tombstone is defeated by Spider-Man Noir, and is later seen being arrested by the police alongside Kingpin and those involved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2061328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061328", "title": "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy", "text": "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\n\nDizzy Mizz Lizzy is an alternative rock band from Denmark formed in 1988. The power trio consists of Tim Christensen (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Martin Nielsen (bass guitar) and Søren Friis (drums). Between 1994 and 1997, they were highly successful in Denmark and Japan and are credited for heading the 1990s rock revival in Denmark with their studio albums \"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" (1994) and \"Rotator\" (1996). The group disbanded in 1998, after which Christensen started a successful solo career.\n\nIn 2010, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy undertook a reunion tour in Denmark and Japan in their original line-up. The popularity of \"Live in Concert 2010\", recorded during this reunion, caused the band to consider a more permanent comeback, which was announced in late 2014. They resumed touring and released their third studio album \"Forward in Reverse\" on April 29, 2016 to critical acclaim. According to critics, it helped the band regain their position as Denmark's most popular rock band. To date, the band has released three studio albums and three live albums.\n\nWhen Tim Christensen's family moved from Espergærde to Valby, a district of Copenhagen, he started attending the Hanssted Skole, where he became friends with his classmate Martin Nielsen on the first day of school, They already cared more about music than about their school work, and decided to start a band. Nielsen picked up the bass because Christensen already played the guitar, and a friend recommended Søren Friis to them. Prior to choosing \"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\", they also considered \"Heaven\", \"King's Cross\", \"Battlefield\", \"After the Storm\" and \"Boyazont\" as a band name.\n\nThe trio practiced instrumentally in the first year while looking for a fourth member who could sing and play guitar, because Christensen, the band's songwriter, was too shy to sing. This continued until they held an audition with Noller from Hvidovre, who sang so badly that they sent him home after a glass of cola. It was then that Friis and Nielsen convinced Christensen to do the vocals in the absence of a better singer, because they felt that every time he sang to demonstrate how he wanted the melody, it sounded exactly the way it should. Later attempts at expanding to a quartet with an extra guitarist failed, and critics would explain: \"From the outset it was clear that Tim Christensen was the group's undisputed center, but the band benefited significantly from the collective dynamics.\"\n\nIn search of their own musical style, they used a cheap youth club in Hvidovre for a rehearsal room while playing \"porn rock with nauseating choruses.\" Their inspiration came from poodle rock bands such as Europe, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. They won the competition \"Rock Træf\" in 1990, using the 5,000 kr (about € 700, or US$ 800) in prize money to record a demo. The band subsequently entered Denmark's largest music championship \"DM i Rock\" in 1991 and came in fourth.\n\nInspired by Nirvana's 1991 album \"Nevermind\" and especially the breakthrough hit \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", their style became more inspired by grunge. As the band would explain, \"Suddenly there was something about playing rock music the old-fashioned way.\" They would throw themselves onto \"Hey Joe\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, \"Rock and Roll\" by Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles' cover of the Larry Williams song \"Dizzy, Miss Lizzy\", from which they derived their band's name. They started writing potential song material and decided to dedicate themselves to a career in music.\n\nChristensen received a Marshall 4x12 G1275 amplifier from his parents for his 18th birthday, which helped him write heavier music and would shortly thereafter result in the riff to the hit song \"Waterline\". Their style would frequently be compared to Led Zeppelin and Pearl Jam, even though critics admitted that \"the trio wants—and inexplicably even manages—to create their own musical identity.\" This style would become known as power rock, which the band would later also use to describe their genre and which they were more comfortable with than the label \"grunge\", explaining: \"We are not so wild about the descriptor grunge, as it has become a predicate for a variety of dimensions. We focus on the music, not the descriptions. What we play is genuine, vivid, and with the energy in high gear.\" As a reviewer would put it: \"[It is] 'Grunge light' perhaps - but well-composed, well-acted, engaging and above all different and personal. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had the pedal to the metal, and it did something.\" Christensen explains: \"It's like The Police, who came out of the punk-wave without being punk, and still did well. It's the same with us. We came out of the grunge-wave, without being grunge.\"\n\nTheir new-found sound took them to the \"DM i Rock\" semifinals in 1992, where they were beaten by Passion Orange. With their third attempt on 30 April 1993, the trio won because of \"their obvious talent and charisma.\" Part of the grand prize was a recording session for a 4-track demo at Sweet Silence Studios, which spawned the songs \"Waterline\" and \"Silverflame\" that became huge hits on DR P3 and DR P4. The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals. A reviewer from that time remarked, \"They are not quite as extroverted as one might have expected, but in return they play much better than one might dare hope for. Dense and energetic, making one wonder why there are only three men on stage. One is tempted to look into the back room to see where the rest of the band is hiding.\" They would also entertain with ironic covers of among others \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees.\n\nOther contestants in the 1993 \"DM i Rock\" competition included Kashmir, who came in second, Inside the Whale, and Impotators. These bands have all had a significant place in the 1990s revival and the further development of rock in Denmark, but of which Dizzy Mizz Lizzy has been the most successful. Friendships have grown among this generation of musicians, which can among others be seen in Christensen's contributions to several Kashmir albums, his continued songwriting with Inside the Whale frontman Marcus Winther-John, and with Inside the Whale guitarist Lars Skjærbæk being the lead guitarist in Christensen's solo band since 2000.\n\nThe high expectations raised by the demo put enormous pressure on the band to deliver, especially because the demo was in limited circulation. The demand grew, but the band took their time to release their debut album. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had declined various offers from foreign labels, waiting for a Danish label to come forward. They \"quite literally felt on home soil\" when they were contacted by Nick Foss, head of A&R at EMI-Medley, and known by the band as the producer of several albums by D-A-D and The Sandmen. He signed them to the label and went into the studio with them for three months.\n\nAt long last, the eponymous debut album \"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" was released on 4 March 1994. It was a huge success in Denmark, selling 220,000 copies, making it the best selling rock album ever in Denmark. This record still stands, and has sold over 250,000 copies by 2011. One notable fan is Crown Prince Frederik, who is an outspoken lover of rock music, and who has attended many of their concerts. By accident, a copy of the CD fell into the hands of someone at EMI's Japanese division, who was excited about the album and had it released in Japan, where it sold about 100,000 copies. Five singles were released from the album and all got much radio play: \"Silverflame\", \"Barbedwired Baby's Dream\", \"Love Is a Loser's Game\", \"Glory\" and \"Waterline\". The band is recognized for heading the early 1990s rock revival in Denmark, which Christensen would later explain as follows: \"The Dizzy records were a mild version of what took place in Seattle with a delay of two years, and therefore perfect for Denmark,\" referring to the grunge movement. However, they lacked an entrance to the UK and US like the modern Danish rock bands do.\n\nInterviews paint a picture of rather well-behaved musicians; they kept living with their parents until their debut album and the ensuing tour had earned them enough money to each buy their own homes in Copenhagen. The closest they ever came to rock star misbehavior was a backstage food fight in Aalborg with Inside the Whale, and trashing a disappointing hotel room in Germany at a time they felt depressed and homesick. The band members rehearsed 3–4 times a week but also received choreography lessons since at that time they considered themselves \"an incredibly boring band to watch\" in terms of their performance.\n\nThey were the support act of the Spin Doctors on their October/November 1994 tour through Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Switzerland. before they flew to Japan to play three sold-out shows in the cities Sapporo, Osaka and Tokyo. The performance in Osaka on 16 July 1995 was recorded and released as the Japan-only CD \"One guitar, one bass and a drummer, that's really all it takes — Live in Japan\", which was later included in the \"Dizzcography\" box set. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy performed for four consecutive years at the Roskilde Festival, from 1993 through to 1996. The 1994 performance was on frontman Christensen's 20th birthday, when sales of their debut album had just crossed the 50,000 mark. In 2003, Christensen considered that particular performance a special highlight in his career. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy won the 1995 Danish Grammys for \"Danish group of the year\", \"Danish newcomer of the year\", \"Danish rock album of the year\", and the \"People's choice award\" which included a fee of 25,000 kr (about € 3,350, or US$ 3,800) to help cover travel expenses. In the time leading up to the release of the band's sophomore album, it was speculated the band would be changing their name to \"Dizzy\". Although this abbreviation is in widespread colloquial use among both band members and fans, the band never considered to use it as an official name.\n\nNick Foss had promised Christensen that if their debut album won gold (equal to 40,000 copies at that time), the next one would be recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London, which would fulfill a boyhood dream of Christensen, who is an immense fan of The Beatles. With the album having sold over four times that amount by 1996, Foss kept his promise and saw to it that the follow-up album \"Rotator\" was recorded at this place that breathes history.\n\nA crisis ensued when Christensen was going through a palette of emotions while recording at the Abbey Road Studios. Christensen could not share these feelings with the other band members as they neither shared Christensen's enthusiasm, nor could appreciate the unique symbolism of recording in these legendary studios as much as Christensen did. This caused Christensen to turn to his long-time girlfriend Pernille Rosendahl in and out of the studio, while becoming increasingly estranged from the band. Nielsen and Friis even went as far as labeling the couple as \"John and Yoko\", referring to the supposed detrimental influence of Yoko Ono on John Lennon, which is said to have contributed to the break-up of the Beatles. This period also showed the first signs of the band members heading in different musical directions, about which Christensen explained in 2000: \"I needed change while the others wanted to continue in the same style, and that was actually the most important reason we split up.\" This is especially evident from the final song on the album \"Rise and Fall\"; although songs were usually a collaborative effort by the band, Christensen requested Nielsen and Friis to allow him to be in full control over this song, and as a result it is distinctly different from all other songs on the album.\n\nThe record was less carefree than its predecessor, with a hint of bitterness especially in regard to the state of the music industry. The album reached gold status the very day it went on sale on 24 May 1996, and appeared to live up to the notorious expectations for a worthy sequel to their debut album. Reviews were generally positive and it sold 100,000 copies in Denmark, \"which is exceptionally high for a guitar rock album in Denmark,\" but it was not nearly as much as the debut album had sold. Another 100,000 copies were sold in Japan. The singles \"11:07 PM\" and \"Rotator\" became a hit, the album won the 1997 Danish Grammy for \"Rock album of the year\" and Nick Foss received the prize for \"Best producer\". They played on festivals in Denmark, Norway and Germany, and went to Japan in September 1996 for shows in Tokyo (2×), Sapporo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka. In Denmark, they played dozens of shows which fatigued both the band and the fans, while the problems that arose during the recording of \"Rotator\" also pursued the band on tour.\n\nAfter five years of non stop recording and touring and having lost touch with reality, the band decided to take a sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998, but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 when discussing the future of the band on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. Critics would later explain their decision as the band having the courage to stop in time despite enormous success, although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring to make heavy metal music.\n\nEighteen days after the breakup, the Japan-only release \"The Greatest\" was released. The song \"Waterline\" was included on the 1999 charity record Grænseløs Greatest in support of refugees of the Kosovo War. In 2000, the Danish dance-pop duo Infernal used samples of the 1994 song \"Silverflame\" for the song \"Sunrise\". It was released as the second single from their album \"Waiting for Daylight\".\n\nFollowing the breakup, Christensen became more introverted than usual, and his girlfriend could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but he went on to find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album \"Secrets on Parade\" in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen took a job as a postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: \"We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things together and I simply can not remember anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, and we kept growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop.\"\n\nOn 29 April 2002, the band released a greatest hits collection including a live performance recorded in Aarhus on 11 May 1996. The band's only performance during their 1998–2009 break was a charity concert called \"Brandalarm\" (Fire Alarm), held on 16 August 2006 in the Copenhagen venue Vega for musicians whose studio had burned to the ground. Here, they played 5 songs in about 20 minutes (\"Thorn in my Pride\", \"When the River Runs Dry\", \"Waterline\", \"Silverflame\", and \"Glory\"). Christensen commented in 2008 that this was a one-off event, but that the band would be open to do a reunion tour at some point in the future for nostalgia's sake, but without the aim to go back into the studio to record a new album. The band would later refer to the charity concert as the first germ towards a reunion.\n\nOn September 15, 2009, the band announced they would hold a small reunion tour in Spring 2010, with concerts in Odense, Aarhus (2 shows), Aalborg, Esbjerg (2 shows) and Copenhagen (4 shows). The idea was spawned when Christensen, Nielsen and Friis were bowling, which they often did when meeting up. EMI suggested the reunion to be paired with the release of a box set containing their collected works. Although the band were sceptical about this at first, \"Dizzcography\" (a portmanteau of 'Dizzy' and 'discography') was released on March 29, 2010 as a 4-CD or 8-vinyl record box set, containing remasters of all previously released material (the band's two studio albums \"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" and \"Rotator\" and the live album \"Live in Aarhus '96\"), and the compilation album \"The Rest of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" which comprises the original 1993 demo, two B-sides and the tracks from the live album \"Live in Japan\".\n\nDizzy Mizz Lizzy were overwhelmed when the tour's first show on 9 April at the K.B. Hallen had sold out in less than 15 seconds on 20 September 2009, and the other shows sold out in less than 45 seconds, showing that the demand for their shows was far greater than they expected. The band subsequently expanded the tour that would eventually total 52 dates, including festival headlines and Japanese legs to the tour in May and September, making this one of the most successful comebacks in the history of Danish music. Their performance at the Roskilde Festival coincided with Christensen's 36th birthday. The renewed interest for Dizzy Mizz Lizzy inspired the Danish producer and DJ Morten Breum to release a remix of \"Waterline\" on 5 April 2010.\n\nAfter the tour's final show in Tokyo on 29 September 2010, the band returned to hibernation. The documentary \"Lost Inside a Dream: The Story of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" by the Danish film maker Theis Molin exploring the band's rise, break-up and reunion premiered at the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival on 4 November 2010. The band attended the film's second screening on 8 November 2010, where they answered questions from the audience. On the same day, the 2CD/DVD and 2CD/Blu-ray set \"Live in Concert 2010\" was released, which includes the documentary and features a live recording of two concerts in the K.B. Hallen on 16–17 April 2010, making it the first Danish performance to be released in Full HD. The moment where Dizzy Mizz Lizzy were awarded a platinum record for this live recording would later be considered the turning point towards the band considering a more permanent comeback. Molin received the Politiken Publikumspris (People's choice award) for his documentary. A few days later, on 12 November 2010, EMI released the compilation album \"Big-5: Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" as part of their Big-5 series, containing their artists' five best tracks. In the case of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, these were all taken from their eponymous debut album.\n\nAfter the reunion, Nielsen and Friis returned to anonymity and resumed their respective jobs as postman and truck driver. while Christensen continued his solo career, with his fourth solo album, \"Tim Christensen and The Damn Crystals\" getting released on 25 November 2011. In interviews, he was often asked questions about Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, to which Christensen explained that already a week after the last show, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy was out of his system again. Prior to the reunion, Christensen was often being asked about a Dizzy-reunion. On the question whether people have stopped asking about this now, Christensen answered: \"No, they haven't. Except that now, it's no longer: 'Will Dizzy ever reunite?' but instead: 'Will you do it again?' And I won't exclude the possibility, but it won't be any time soon. But I have stopped asking that question to myself.\" Christensen went on to release \"\" in 2012, and he performed a Paul McCartney tribute with Mike Viola, Tracy Bonham and his solo band The Damn Crystals in 2012, which was released as the live album \"Pure McCartney\" in 2013. Together with Mads Langer, he recorded the EP \"Side Effects\" in 2014, of which \"Bringing Back Tomorrow\" became a hit. He was expected to also be working on his fifth solo album or a second volume of The EP Series, which Christensen still plans in addition to the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy reunion.\n\nOn October 20, 2014, Christensen wrote the abbreviation \"DML2015\" on his Facebook wall, indicating a second reunion of his former band Dizzy Mizz Lizzy. Two days later, they revealed that they had written new songs and that six shows in Denmark were booked for April–May 2015, though at that time they indicated it was not yet known if the band would release an LP, an EP, or just one or two singles, as that would depend on the mood and creativity. However, they later revealed that they had worked on the album for several years in secret.\n\nThe band explained during a concert on 5 June 2015 that they do not consider themselves a \"reunited\" band, but a \"re-activated\" band. The band's first new single in 19 years, \"I Would If I Could but I Can't\", was aired on the Danish radio station DR P3 on 5 January 2015. Their first performance of their second reunion was during \"Sport 2014\", a Danish sports ceremony, where they also played their single. The second single, \"Made to Believe\", was released on April 10, 2015 in honor of their tour start. The band among others toured through Denmark, played at Bospop in the Netherlands, and held several concerts in Japan. Before the tour, a secret rehearsal concert was performed in the same small club in Valby where they held their first larger performance in 1989, to which they invited former classmates of the band members.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, a biography of the band was released entitled \"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy – en drengedrøm\" (\"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy – A Boy's Dream\"), written by Jan Poulsen. On 7 November 2015, they performed at the Danish Grammy ceremony, where Christensen won the IFPI's Ærespris (Honorary Award), which is considered the most prestigious prize a Danish musician can be awarded. On 12 March 2016, they performed a show for Rockpalast.\n\nThe band's third studio album, \"Forward in Reverse\" was released on 20 April 2016, which was their first collection of new material in 20 years, after \"Rotator\" from 24 May 1996. In anticipation of the album, \"Brainless\" was released as the third single on 1 April 2016. The album's release was followed by an extensive tour of festivals and clubs in Denmark, and concerts in Japan, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nAfter the last show on 10 June 2017 in Berlin, the band took a break from touring to work on new material. During this time, the band released the live double-LP \"Livegasm!\" on 29 November (Japan) and 8 December 2017 (Denmark). It instantly became the best sold vinyl record in Denmark of 2017. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy expected to release their fourth studio album in 2018, but no release date has been announced yet. The band has resumed touring, and will also play a double headline concert with Lenny Kravitz at Horsens Statsfængsel (Horsens State Prison) on 25 May 2019.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy released their fourth studio album \"Alter Echo\".\n\nSince the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy have been using the photo of a young \"dizzy\" girl as mascot, which has been used in varying ways. Christensen explains: \"The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my grandmother on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo.\" On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album \"The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy\" superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, \"Rotator\". During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal on the front of the 2010 \"Dizzcography\" box set. This set included all previous albums, of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD \"Live in Concert 2010\" features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album \"Forward in Reverse\" and its singles.\n\nFor the 2010 reunion tour, Christensen and Rasmus Meyer of the Danish guitar pedal manufacturer Carl Martin designed his signature \"Dizzy Drive\" with knobs for level, tone, drive and edge. Its production was limited to 250 pedals, and went on sale on 16 May 2010. Christensen's effect pedal board during the reunion tour was quite small and only contained the following stomp boxes:\n\n\n\n"}

The Saharias are mainly found in the districts of Morena, Sheopur, Bhind, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Vidisha and Guna districts of Madhya Pradesh and Baran district of Rajasthan.\n\nThe history of the Saharia tribe is spotty and in many places completely lost. The older generations of the Saharia tribespeople fail to give any account of their history, and written records of ancestry are virtually nonexistent. \nTraditionally, they trace their beginnings to the days of the Ramayana and beyond. They trace their origin from Shabri of the Ramayan. Another theory suggests that Brahma, the creator was busy casting the Universe. He made out a place to seat all persons. In the centre of that place he put a Sahariya who was a simpleton. Others came to join him sitting but they pushed him further from the square centre to an extreme corner or khoont. The story goes that an annoyed Brahma chided the Sahariya for his inability to cope with the pressure and decreed that he would henceforth live in forests and such other out of the way places. Some Sahariya's claim descent from Baiju Bheel, a worshiper of the Hindu god Shiva.\n\nThey inhabit clusters of houses in areas called saharana outside the main villages. The housing is generally characterized by prehistoric standards made of stone boulders and roofing of stone slabs that locally are called patore. In some villages mud structures are also constructed. Brick and concrete are very rare. They live in small joint families. The elder sons live separately after marriage and younger son bear the responsibilities of the parents and unmarried brothers-sisters.\n\nThe tribe members believe in Animism Folk Hinduism's gods and goddess that they worship and celebrate in major festivals: Veer Teja, Dhakar Baba, Durga, Hanuman, Lalbai, Bejasan, Savni Amavasya, Janmashtami, Raksha Bandhan, Deepavali, Holi and Teja Dashmi.\n\nThey consider everyone in an endogamous group to be brother and sister; marriages have to be arranged from other clans. During the marriage ceremony, totems are drawn on paper and the floor that they hold in reverence. Child marriage is not favored, although there are some arranged marriages, and any marriage is performed after attaining the age of 15 years. Widow marriage called nat is permitted but only to a fellow widower or a divorcee. Polygamy is reserved only for males.\n\nThe Sahariya community considers every adult member part of a governing council which is headed by a patel. A patel's appointment is based on heredity criteria but found to be unfit or unsuitable is basis for removal. The council decides disputes by a consensus. It imposes fines and ostracism on guilty offenders committing rape, elopement or adultery. An inter-village dispute is referred to as a Chokla Panchayat. Since they may be surrounded by speakers of other languages and dialects they may speak various Hindi dialects.\n\nThe Sahariyas are expert woodsmen and forest product gatherers. They are particularly skilled in making catechu from Khair trees. The main business is gathering & selling of forest wood, gum, tendu leaf, honey, mahua and medicinal herbs. Their traditional occupations also include making baskets, mining and quarrying, and breaking stones. They also hunt and fish.\nSome Sahariyas are settled cultivators. Wheat, pearl millet and maize are the main cereal crops. Gram and arhar are the main pulses. Agriculture is largely rain-dependent with merely 2% of the total land area being irrigated. The main sources of irrigation are wells and rivulets, which are seasonal. Others are landless labourers who were earlier bonded labourers.\n\nThe general health conditions of the tribe are very poor. There is prevalence of malnutrition and pulmonary tuberculosis. RNTCP-DOTS programme is working effectively to change this condition. The Centre for Genomics at Jiwaji University, Gwalior is carrying out active clinical and genetic research in order to identify the genetic and non-genetic underlying causes for their ailments.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2061347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061347", "title": "Sportsbook", "text": "Sportsbook\n\nIn the United States a sportsbook or a race and sports book (sometimes abbreviated as book) is a place where a gambler can wager on various sports competitions, including golf, football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, horse racing, greyhound racing, boxing, and mixed martial arts. The method of betting varies with the sport and the type of game. In the US, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 allowed only Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware to legally wager on sports (other than horse racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai); the law was ruled unconstitutional May 14, 2018, freeing the states to legalize sports betting at their discretion.\n\nWinning bets are paid when the event finishes, or if not finished, when played long enough to become official; otherwise all bets are returned. This policy can cause some confusion since there can be a difference between what the sportsbook considers official and what the sports league consider official. Customers should carefully read the sportsbook rules before placing their bets.\n\nThe betting volume at sportsbooks varies throughout the year. Bettors have more interest in certain types of sports and increase the money wagered when those sports are in season. Major sporting events that don't follow a specific schedule, like boxing, can create peaks of activity for the sportsbooks.\n\nMost of the United States sportsbooks are located in Nevada. Now that many casinos share the same parent company, they offer exactly the same wagering choices and odds, which is a disadvantage to the astute gambler who in the past could do more shopping for better prices. \n\nIn 1949, Nevada allowed bookmakers to accept bets on horse racing and professional sports. The first Nevada sportsbooks were called Turf Clubs. They were independent from the casinos and had an informal agreement with the hotels that they would stay out of the casino business as long as the hotels stayed out of the sportsbook business. The sportsbooks had to pay a 10 percent tax so they charged a high vigorish to gamblers, but they still brought enough business to make a profit.\n\nIn 1974 the tax was lowered to 2 percent, in 1983 to 0.25 percent, and in 1975 Frank Rosenthal, who ran the Stardust Casino, convinced legislators to allow sportsbooks in the casinos, and soon nearly all of the casinos added them. The turf clubs were no longer able to compete and eventually all closed. \n\nNevada casino sportsbooks generally feature betting windows, big screen televisions, interactive betting stations, odds boards (usually computerized), papers with different odds for the day, and places to sit and watch games and races.\n\nSome casinos use third-party operators for their sportsbooks, such as Cantor Gaming, Leroy's, Lucky's, and Club Cal Neva. In 2011, British bookmaker William Hill agreed to buy the Leroy's, the Lucky's, and the Cal Neva chains, which would give it control of 115 of the state's 183 books.\n\nThe Super Bowl is the most popular event for the Nevada sportsbooks. They earned $7.2 million on the $99 million wagered on it in 2013. Because it attracts many unsophisticated bettors, the books had made money on 21 of the previous 23 Super Bowls, with an average win of $5.5 million over the previous 10 years. The most profitable Super Bowl was in 2005, when the Philadelphia Eagles covered the spread against the favored New England Patriots, earning the books $15.4 million. The two losses were in 1995—when the San Francisco 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers—and 2008—when the favored Patriots lost to the New York Giants, costing the books $2.5 million.\n\nIn 2009, a bill passed to allow betting on almost every sport. That year, the NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA, and NCAA filed a lawsuit against the state of Delaware, claiming their sports books were violating federal law. The US Supreme Court ruled that the law partially violated the federal law, and Delaware was only allowed to offer parlays on NFL games. Delaware's three racetrack casinos—Dover Downs, Harrington Raceway & Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack—have sports books. Each sportsbook has multiple televisions, large tote boards and stations for people to wager. During the 2011 NFL season, the three sports books generated $4.4 million in revenue for the state. On June 5, 2018, the casino sportsbooks in Delaware expanded sports betting to single-game and championship wagers on professional and college sports (excluding Delaware college teams) including football, baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, boxing/MMA, golf, and auto racing. \n"}
