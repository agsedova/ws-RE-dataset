The first signed artists were Sido and B-Tight. Later, the label also signed Bushido. The same year it released EP \"Das Mic und Ich\" by A.i.d.S (formerly Royal TS) on the label, which was the first release of Aggro Berlin. In 2002 released the two samplers \"Aggro Ansage Nr. 1\" and \"Aggro Ansage Nr. 2\", which contains tracks by its signed artists. Fler was also featured on the second sampler, but he had not yet signed on to the label. Bushido and Fler released, in the same year, the collabo album, entitled \"Carlo, Cokxxx, Nutten\".\n\nIn 2003 Aggro Berlin released Bushido's debut album \"Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline\", which was indexed by BPjM (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons).\n\nLater, in 2004, Sido's debut album, \"Maske\" sold more than 100,000 copies in less than a month. In September of that year, the rapper won a prestigious German music award for \"Best Newcomer\", but his album had been indexed.\n\nIn June 2004 Bushido left the label and signed with Universal.\n\nG-Hot's contract ran out in Autumn 2006. After the song \"Keine Toleranz\" (No Tolerance) appeared on the internet in July 2007, Aggro Berlin renounced any further business association with him. The song, which featured Boss A, discriminates against homosexuals and calls to kill homosexuals. It was not officially released by any label and G-Hot stated that it had been recorded many years prior to its leak and was never intended to be released. \n\nAccording to Sido and Fler in an interview with the German hip-hop magazine Juice, Aggro Berlin has not been a fully independent label since October 2007 but now collaborates with Universal Records.\n\n\n"}

The nation has an enrolled population of 3,752 people, 1,191 of whom live on the band's reserves. Elected Chief Byron Bitternose leads the First Nation. Their territory is located on the Gordon 86 reserve, as arranged by Treaty 4.\n\nIn 1874, Treaty 4, which brokered the sale of indigenous land to the British Crown, was established between Queen Victoria and the Cree and Saulteaux First Nations. On September 15 of the same year, \"Kaneonuskatew\" (or, in his English name of George Gordon) was among the first of the indigenous leaders to make the agreement, signing as Chief of the George Gordon First Nation. By 1884, half of the families belonging to the nation were farming, a development which had commenced in 1876, and would continue for many years. Although both George Gordon and his son, Moses Gordon, were originally hereditary chiefs, the people have since adopted the practice of democratically voting their chiefs and councillors into office.\n\nThe George Gordon First Nation was the location of Gordon Indian Residential School, the longest-running residential school in Canada. The Anglican Church of Canada established a day school on Gordon’s Reserve in 1876. It was expanded in 1888 to provide housing to students attending the school. In 1929 the school was destroyed by fire and eventually rebuilt. Problems with water supply and maintenance led to its being closed for much of the time between 1947 and 1953. The school was closed in 1996. Children attending Gordon Indian Residential School were reported to have suffered various forms of abuse, inflicting severe damage to the Gordon community. The schools have been proven to have facilitated the abuse of children under their care. The federal government knew of these abuses, and has since apologized and paid compensation to the victims. The extent of the damage done to these communities is still yet known. The residential school system is widely regarded as cultural genocide, due to the action of destroying Indigenous culture, language, and religion, as well as the intent to do so. On the reserve, the Gordon Recovery and Wellness Centre provides services and support to the victims of the abuse that occurred during the Residential School System.\n\nTheir reserves include:\n\n\nThe George Gordon First Nation boasts a modern medical clinic, an education centre, a computer centre, an arena and a day care, as well as the Gordon Retail Centre and the Buffalo Ranch Project. Programs that are offered to band members include the Residential School Recovery and Wellness Centre, Brighter Futures, and Gordon Social Development. Other community infrastructures include a band office, pre-fab plant, fire hall, teachers centre, gymnasium, warehouse, water treatment plant, and machine shed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2209603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209603", "title": "Fire-stick farming", "text": "Fire-stick farming\n\nFire-stick farming, also known as cultural burning, is the practice of Aboriginal Australians regularly using fire to burn vegetation. Aboriginal Australians pre-date the extinction of the Australian megafauna. The associated loss of browsing and grazing animals resulted in savannah changing into dry forest. In the resultant sclerophyll forests, fire-stick farming maintained an open canopy and allowed germination of understorey plants necessary for increasing the carrying capacity of the local environment for browsing and grazing animals. Aboriginal people may have been able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. There may have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of jungle. This type of farming directly increased the food supply for Aboriginal people by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants.\n\nWhile it has been discontinued in many parts of Australia, it has been reintroduced to some Aboriginal groups by the teachings of custodians from areas where the practice is extant in continuous unbroken tradition, such as the Noongar peoples' cold fire. \nThere are a number of purposes, including to facilitate hunting, to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area, weed control, hazard reduction, and increase of biodiversity. Fire-stick farming had the long-term effect of turning dry forest into savannah, increasing the population of nonspecific grass-eating species like the kangaroo.\n\nThe term \"fire-stick farming\" was coined by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969.\n\nA 2011 research paper has questioned whether Indigenous Australians carried out widespread burning of the Australian landscape. A study of charcoal records from more than 220 sites in Australasia dating back 70,000 years has found that the arrival of the first inhabitants about 50,000 years ago did not result in significantly greater fire activity across the continent - although this date is in question, with sources pointing to much earlier migrations at perhaps 100,000 and 120,000 years ago. The arrival of European colonists after 1788, however, resulted in a substantial increase in fire activity. The study shows higher bushfire activity from about 70,000 to 28,000 years ago. It decreased until about 18,000 years ago, around the time of the last glacial maximum, and then increased again, a pattern consistent with shifts between warm and cool climatic conditions. This suggests that fire in Australasia predominantly reflects climate, with colder periods characterised by less and warmer intervals by more biomass burning.\n\nSome researchers, like David Horton from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, suggest, \"Aboriginal use of fire had little impact on the environment and ... the patterns of distribution of plants and animals which obtained 200 years ago would have been essentially the same whether or not Aborigines had previously been living here\".\n\nThis regular firing favoured not only fire-tolerant or fire-resistant plants, but also encouraged those animals which were favoured by more open country. On this basis, it is clear that Aboriginal burning, in many areas at least, did affect the \"natural\" ecosystem, producing a range of vegetation associations which would maximise productivity in terms of the food requirements of the Aboriginal people. Jones goes so far as to say that \"through firing over thousands of years, Aboriginal man has managed to extend his natural habitat zone\".\n\nAboriginal burning has been blamed for a variety of environmental changes, including the extinction of the Australian megafauna, a diverse range of large animals which populated Pleistocene Australia. A. P. Kenshaw, among others, has argued that Aboriginal burning may have modified the vegetation to the extent that the food resources of the megafauna were diminished, and as a consequence the largely herbivorous megafauna became extinct. Kershaw is one of a small but growing group of palynologists who suggest that the arrival of Aborigines may have occurred more than 100,000 years ago, fire-stick in hand, eager to burn the virgin landscape. He suggests that their burning caused the sequences of vegetation changes which he detects through the late Pleistocene. The first to propose such an early arrival for Aboriginal peoples was Gurdip Singh from the Australian National University, who found evidence in his pollen cores from Lake George indicating that Aboriginal people began burning in the lake catchment around 120,000 years ago.\n\nTim Flannery believes that the megafauna were hunted to extinction by Aboriginal people soon after they arrived. He argues that with the rapid extinction of the megafauna, virtually all of which were herbivorous, a great deal of vegetation was left uneaten, increasing the standing crop of fuel. As a consequence, fires became larger and hotter than before, causing the reduction of fire-sensitive plants to the advantage of those that were fire-resistant or fire-dependent. Flannery suggests that Aboriginal people then began to burn more frequently to maintain a high species diversity and to reduce the effect of high intensity fires on medium-sized animals and perhaps some plants. He argues that twentieth-century Australian mammal extinctions are largely the result of the cessation of Aboriginal \"firestick farming\".\n\nMost of these theories implicate Aboriginal use of fire as a component of the changes to both plant and animal communities within Australia during the last 50,000 years. Aboriginal people had some effect, but the significance of that effect is far from clear. It seems likely that the introduction of the intensive use of fire as a tool did follow, but was not directly a consequence of, the extinction of the megafauna. If, as has been suggested, the megafauna remained in some areas until the Holocene, then we should be looking for evidence within the last 10,000 years for changes induced by new Aboriginal burning patterns.\n\nThe other factor which few of these researchers have considered is the likelihood that Aboriginal population density increased rapidly and dramatically over the last 5–10,000 years. An increase in Aboriginal burning frequency may have been associated with the introduction or invention of new technologies that allowed Aboriginal people to concentrate on those large resources which were previously so difficult to capture – kangaroos and large wallabies. Fire was initially used to promote and retain the environments which were most suitable for these animals, and fire was subsequently used for maximising the productivity of these areas after the massive Aboriginal population increase which occurred during the late Holocene, probably because of the greater access to this abundant resource.\n\nThe stone technology which Aboriginal people had been using with little modification for over 40,000 years diversified and specialised in the last 5,000 years. Spear barbs and tips peaked about 2,000 years ago, and then completely disappeared from the archaeological record in southeastern Australia. They were replaced by technologies associated with the exploitation of smaller animals – shell fish hooks and bone points along the coast for fishing, axes for hunting possums across the woodlands, and adzes for sharpening digging sticks along the banks of the larger rivers where the yams were abundant. The intensive and regular use of fire was an essential component of this late Holocene shift in resource base. The evidence suggests that Aboriginal burning may have affected Australian vegetation, but that by far the greatest effect has occurred over the last 5,000 years.\n\nDuring the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season some experts suggested that using fire-stick farming could be beneficial in the future. Traditional practitioners had already worked with some fire agencies to conduct burns on a small scale, with the uptake of workshops held by the Firesticks Alliance Indigenous Corporation increasing each year. Farmers and other landowners were interested in learning how traditional fire practices could help them to preserve their properties. Former Emergency Management Commissioner for the state of Victoria, Craig Lapsley, called on the Federal Government to fund and implement a national Indigenous burning program. Firesticks Alliance spokesperson Oliver Costello said that a cultural burn could help to prevent wildfires, rejuvenate local flora and protect native animal habitat.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was from Pakistan, his mother from Chile. When he was a child, Haque traveled with his parents all over the world, spending time in Spain, France, and Iran, in addition to Pakistan and Chile. In 1981 he was given a guitar scholarship from North Texas State University, where he studied jazz guitar. He left after a year and studied classical guitar at Northwestern University. At Northwestern, he joined Howard Levy's jazz fusion group. Levy introduced him to Cuban saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, who became a lifelong friend and mentor.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Rivera introduced Haque to Sting, who had recently founded the record label Pangaea. Haque recorded two albums for Pangaea, \"Voices Rising\" and \"Manresa\", and toured with Sting. He recorded \"Majestad\", an unreleased album for Warner Bros. Records which included John Patitucci, Lenny Castro, Russell Ferrante, Michael Landau, and Carlos Vega. Then he signed with Blue Note Records, made the solo albums \"Sacred Addiction\", \"Opaque\", and \"Deja Vu\", and recorded three albums with Javon Jackson. He also played with Joey Calderazzo, Joe Henderson, Bob James, Herbie Mann, and Cassandra Wilson.\n\nAt Northwestern, Haque was a member of Chevere, a Latin fusion group, and on their album \"Reunion\" he played with Cuban trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, Panamanian pianist Danilo Pérez, and Puerto Rican percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo. He joined the jazz fusion group Zawinul Syndicate after he was introduced to Joe Zawinul by Bob Belden, a producer at Blue Note. The Syndicate included Armenian vocalist Arto Tunçboyacıyan, drummer Paco Sery from the Ivory Coast, and American bassist Matt Garrison. He was a member of the Indian fusion band Summit, led by saxophonist George Brooks and including Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain.\n\nIn 2001 Haque founded Garaj Mahal, a jam band that played a combination of jazz, rock, and funk that evolved from the members' diverse musical backgrounds. The band included German bassist Kai Eckhardt. Garaj Mahal toured the U.S. for ten years, releasing several albums. In 2007 it won an Independent Music Award. Two years later Haque was named best world guitarist by \"Guitar Player\".\n\nWhile recording for Garaj Mahal, Haque discovered the Moog Guitar and electronic music and formed the band MathGames. He started The Flat Earth Ensemble as an exploration of his Indian roots. Because of his parents' heritage, he grew up hearing music from India and Pakistan.

Ivanovic was born in the former Yugoslavia to a Serbian father and Croatian mother, though, like Haque, he is based in Chicago. Haque and Ivanovic played classical guitar on their duets, \"Macedonian Blues\" (2003) and \"Seven Boats\" (2004).\n\nHaque wrote the \"Lahara Double Concerto\" for guitar, sitar, and tabla. He performed it in 2004 with the Chicago Sinfonietta and tabla musician Ustad Zakir Hussain. He composed the \"Gamelan Concerto\" as a commissioned classical guitar piece for the Fulcrum Point Ensemble. With the Chicago Philharmonic he gave a concert in which he performed both the Villa Lobos and Aranjuez guitar concertos.\n\nIn 1988, he was hired by Northern Illinois University to teach jazz and classical guitar.

He acted as a front for blacklisted writers although his use of surrogate screenwriters predates the McCarthy era. His actual contributions to the scripts he is credited with writing is controversial and he was known to some as a credit-grabber. Born to Polish immigrants, he earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois and a law degree at Chicago-Kent College of Law.\n\nPhilip Yordan was born to Polish Jewish immigrants on April 1, 1914 in Chicago. From a young age he had taken an interest in writing. As a teenager, he ran a mail-order beauty supply business out of the family basement. Yordan was an avid fan of detective stories; he contemplated a career as a writer. After graduating from high school, he acted at the Goodman Theatre before earning a law degree.\n\nA common anecdote in Hollywood was that he hired someone else to go through law school for him using his name to get the degree without having to do any of the work, however Yordan himself denied it.\n\nHe became dissuaded with a legal career and decided to pursue writing, eventually becoming a screenwriter.\n\nYordan went to Hollywood in 1938 to work for William Dieterle, who had been impressed by one of Yordan's plays. Yordan did some uncredited writing on \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" (1941) and his first credit was for \"Syncopation\" (1942), directed by Dieterle at RKO. He also worked briefly at Columbia Pictures as a staff writer.\n\nYordan wrote a script for the King Brothers, \"Dillinger\" which was too expensive to produce. They suggested he write something less expensive. He came up with a melodrama, \"The Unknown Guest\" (1943).\n\nThe Kings liked his work and hired Yordan to write \"Johnny Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" (1944) and \"When Strangers Marry\" (1944), although Dennis Cooper wrote the first draft which Yordan then rewrote. They all did well enough for Yordan to be able to make \"Dillinger\" (1945). Reportedly, he wrote the script with William Castle and Robert Tasker, neither of whom received any credit. The screenplay earned Yordan an Oscar nomination, a first for Monogram Pictures.\n\nYordan wrote \"Woman Who Came Back\" (1945) for Republic Pictures and \"Whistle Stop\" (1946) for producer Seymour Nebenzal starring Ava Gardner. Yordan was an associate producer on the latter. He did uncredited work on \"Why Girls Leave Home\" (1945).\n\nThe King Brothers used him again for \"Suspense\" (1946) then he wrote \"The Chase\" (1946) for Nebenzal.\n\nThe Kings got him to do a Western, \"Bad Men of Tombstone\" (1949).\n\nYordan had written a play based on Eugene O'Neill's \"Anna Christie\", adapted to be about a Polish American family and titled \"Anna Lucasta\". Later he found out that Abram Hill had rewritten the same play for the American Negro Theater in New York. The lighter, more comedic production had received critical accolades. Yordan received financial backing and signed an agreement with Hill and producer John Wildberg. \"Anna Lucasta\" was revised with a gala opening at the Mansfield Theatre on August 30, 1944. It was a tremendous success, running for a record 957 performances and leading to two film adaptations.\n\nYordan had hired several writers to rewrite Anna Lucasta before the play premiered on Broadway. In 1947, Lee Richardson, Antoinette Perry and Brock Pemberton sued Yordan for not paying them. The American Negro Theater was contracted to receive five percent of all production rights and two percent of the subsidiary rights for Anna Lucasta if the play went on the road with a different cast, however they received considerably less than that for the Broadway show and none at all for the tour or any of the films. When \"Anna Lucasta\" went to Broadway, the new production retained only a few of the ANT actors.\n\nThe first film adaption in 1949 was produced by Yordan with a Polish American family like in his original version. The other, made in 1958 had an all-black cast like the American Negro Theater production, and starred Eartha Kitt, Sammy Davis Jr., and Henry Scott. Only Yordan retained a writing credit for both films.\n\nYordan's first credit for a major studio was \"House of Strangers\" (1949) which he adapted from a Jerome Weidman novel for Fox. Yordan had been fired by producer Sol C. Siegel after an incomplete first draft which Siegel felt wasn't working. Yordan's unfinished script was rewritten by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who replaced Yordan's dialogue with his own. He directed the film using his own revised screenplay. When the Screen Writers Guild decided that it should be listed as a shared credit, Mankiewicz angrily refused to split and Yordan was awarded sole credit.\n\nIn 1955, he won an Academy Award for Broken Lance. It was a remake of 1949's \"House of Strangers\", and he did not write single word. He won his Oscar for Best Original Story for material in the story files that had formed the basis for House of Strangers, salvaged, provided a Western context, and refurbished by producer-writer Michael Blankfort.\n\nYordan formed his own company, Security Pictures.\n\nIn 1949, he announced he would write and produce \"The Big Blonde\" based on a story by Dorothy Parker. Irving Lerner was going to direct. It was not made – the rights to the story went to Mark Robson's company.\n\nFor Walter Wanger he did \"The Black Book\" (1949). He did some uncredited work on \"Panic in the Streets\" (1950) and \"No Way Out\" (1950), both for Fox, and wrote \"Edge of Doom\" (1950) for Sam Goldwyn.\n\nThe King Brothers used him for a Western, \"Drums in the Deep South\" (1951), and a South Sea film, \"Mutiny\" (1952). He did \"Detective Story\" (1951) for William Wyler at Paramount and provided the story for \"Mara Maru\" (1952) at Warners. \"Detective Story\" earned Yordan an Oscar nomination.\n\nYordan adapted \"Houdini\" (1953) for Paramount and \"Blowing Wild\" (1953) for Warner Bros.\n\nSecurity Pictures made \"The Big Combo\" (1955), a co-production with the company of star Cornel Wilde; Yordan wrote the script and produced with Sidney Harmon.\n\nYordan wrote \"The Man from Laramie\" (1955) for James Stewart and director Anthony Mann, the last film Stewart and Mann made together.\n\nYordan wrote \"Conquest of Space\" (1955) for Haskin. He worked on the script for \"Joe MacBeth\" (1955), and did another for Mann, \"The Last Frontier\" (1955).\n\nYordan produced and adapted Budd Schulberg's novel \"The Harder They Fall\" (1956), which was directed by Mark Robson.\n\nFor Security Pictures he produced \"The Wild Party\" (1956) and wrote \"Four Boys and a Gun\" (1957).\n\nHe provided the story for \"Street of Sinners\" (1957) for Security.\n\nYordan wrote \"No Down Payment\" (1957) for Martin Ritt at Fox, and \"Island Women\" (1957) at Security.\n\nAt Fox he wrote the Westerns \"The Bravados\" (1958) and \"The Fiend Who Walked the West\" (1958) (a remake of \"Kiss of Death\").\n\nYordan adapted \"Little Man Big World\" by W. R. Burnett for Robert Ryan to star for Security, but the film was not made.\n\nIn 1957 Security and Milton Sperling purchased the Kling Studios.\n\nHe wrote and produced \"Day of the Outlaw\" (1959) at Security and wrote \"The Bramble Bush\" (1960) for Warners. Security optioned \"The Tribe That Lost Its Head\" but it was not made.\n\nIn 1959 Yordan and Harmon announced they would made four films for Columbia. They were going to start with a World War II story, \"Kingdom of Man\".\n\nYordan produced the TV series \"\" (1960–61). He also made some uncredited contributions to the script of \"The Time Machine\" (1960).\n\nYordan struck a deal with screenwriter Ben Maddow who was having difficulty getting work because of the left-wing associations. They were to split the money down the middle, with Yordan assuming sole credit. Maddow wrote \"Man Crazy\" which Yordan and Sidney Harmon produced for Security Pictures and \"The Naked Jungle\" which was directed by Byron Haskin at Paramount.\n\nMaddow would go to write several scripts for him including \"Men in War\" (1957) and possibly \"God's Little Acre\" (1958) as well as Yordan's only novel, \"Man of the West\" on which the 1957 film \"Gun Glory\" (1957) was based. Yordan disputed the screenwriter' contribution to \"God's Little Acre\".\n\nAlthough he also spoke well of Yordan, in an interview Maddow once remembered his anger and astonishment at passing through England and discovering a Penguin edition of \"Man of the West\" for which he had not been compensated.\n\nYordan received sole credit for \"Johnny Guitar\" (1954) for Republic Pictures, which became a major cult film, although it is unclear how much Yordan actually contributed to the final script. Ben Maddow claimed to have written the entire Johnny Guitar screenplay, but recanted after seeing the picture years later. Roy Chanslor, the author of the original novel and a prolific screenwriter himself, also wrote a screenplay draft.\n\nIn 1960, he wrote and produced \"Studs Lonigan\" (1960), although blacklisted writers Arnaud D'Usseau and Bernard Gordon did much of the actual writing.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Yordan got two scripts mixed up and delivered a Fox script to producer Milton Sperling at Warner Bros., dropping the Warners script off to Darryl F. Zanuck at Fox. As the writer was under contract to Fox, Zanuck threatened to blackball Yordan at all the major studios.\n\nIn 1959 Sperling fired Yordan when the screenwriter delivered his script for \"The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond\" (1960). Yordan's secretary claimed that she had written it. Confronted by Sperling, Yordan argued that she had taken down his words and been given a bonus for her work however he had admitted enough to warrant his dismissal from the project Sperling then hired a new writer. Yordan then did uncredited writing on \"Murder by Contract\" and \"The Lost Missile\".\n\nAfter serving as a writer-producer for \"The Harder They Fall\", Columbia studio head Sam Briskin hired Yordan, provided he keep an office on the lot and that his authorship of any scripts would be guaranteed. However, Yordan allegedly continued to shuttle scripts around town and rarely appeared at Columbia. Caught violating the terms of his contract, Yordan was forced to return the $25,000 he had already been paid. He was barred from Columbia, as well as nearly every other studio in Hollywood.\n\nUnable to work in Hollywood, Yordan found opportunity in Spain with independent producer Samuel L. Bronston. Yordan's association with Bronston began when he worked on \"King of Kings\" (1961), directed by Nicholas Ray. Bronston engaged him to fix the script for the film and Yordan then hired Ray Bradbury to write the voice-over narration, used an anonymous Italian writer for the script. He retained sole writing credit on the finished film.\n\nYordan stayed with Bronston to write \"El Cid\" (1961) for Mann, although it is more likely the actual scripting was done by blacklistees Ben Barzman and Bernard Gordon.\n\nYordan was credited on \"The Day of the Triffids\" (1963) but he was a \"front\" for Bernard Gordon. He continued to work regularly for Bronston: \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963), directed by Ray and Guy Green, with Yordan producing, contributing ideas and being a script front for Gordon; \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964), directed by Mann; and \"Circus World\" (1964), directed by Henry Hathaway (mostly written by Gordon).\n\nBoth \"55 Days at Peking\" and \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" were box-offices failures and Bronston declared bankruptcy. In addition to the production company's immense production costs and expense accounts, Yordan and producer Michael Waszynski were reportedly diverting large sums for their own purposes.\n\nIn 1963 Security Pictures announced they would make ten films for Allied Artists over two and a half years, including \"The Tribe That Lost Its Head\"; \"Gretta\", based on a book by Erskine Caldwell; a Western called \"Bad Man's River\"; and a science fiction film \"Crack in the World\". Many of these were not made.\n\nFor Security Pictures, Yordan produced \"The Thin Red Line\" (1964) and \"Crack in the World\" (1965).\n\nSecurity combined with Cinerama to make \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965), which he produced; \"Custer of the West\" (1967) and \"\" (1968) which he produced. Gordon recalled collaborating on the first draft of the Bulge script with Yordan, a first during their lengthy association Gordon and Julian Zimet wrote \"Custer of the West\" \n\nSecurity went on to make \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\" (1969), which Yordan wrote and produced.

He claims to never have read a newspaper till he was 50 and his use of Hollywood blacklistees was believed to be not out of political commitment but because \"\"he got the better people cheaper\".\n\nHe reportedly once told screenwriter Bernard Gordon that \"It's Jews like you who ruined the motion picture industry with this anti-hero shit.\"\n\nHe was married four times. Upon his death he was survived by his fourth wife, five children, and two grandchildren.\n\nProducer Milton Sperling later said \"\"Don’t let anyone tell you he couldn’t write. He could write exceedingly well. . . . He had a kind of Jungian memory of film, a kind of collective unconscious, a memory bank that would work for him in any given situation. He could have been one of the best writers. He had ability, no question about it. But his greed overcame his creative talent.\"\n\n"}

It is co-extensive with the national administrative district (\"správní obvod\") of the same name.\n\nAs of the end of 2004, 48,918 people lived in 34,689 homes in the district. At 4.19 km² (1,035 acres), Prague 2 is the smallest administrative district in the country.\n\nThe district includes all of Vyšehrad and parts of Vinohrady, New Town and Nusle. The district has remained intact since its creation in 1960.\n\nVyšehrad contains the Czech national cemetery and the ruins of a medieval fortress. It is considered the area of the historic establishment of the Czech rulers. High-priced residential area.\n\nThe historical center of Vinohrady, with its expensive apartment buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century, also falls under the jurisdiction of Prague 2. The popularity of this district as a residential area is not based only on the beauty of the facades, tidiness of the streets, but also for its ranking among the top in Prague in the area of gastronomic services in terms of quality and quantity. And it is one of Prague's main epicentres of nightlife, also for gays and lesbians. Important sights: The Žižkov television tower and the Rieger Gardens - one of the most famous Prague parks. The grand central plaza of Vinohrady is Namesti Miru with the Vinohrady Theatre, the National House of Vinohrady and the main Prague 2 municipal building.\n\nNew Town is less a residential but a business area and known for the \"Pavlak\" - I.P. Pavlova station which connects Karlovo náměstí – and thus also New Town – with Náměstí Míru in Vinohrady. Tramlines cross here with Metro line C, as well as night buses and the expressway bringing cars from the D1 highway directly to the centre and through to Holešovice in the north of the city. Important sites:Charles Square- the biggest square in Prague and also among the biggest squares in Europe - with the New City Hall / Gothic town hall, Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius, the Botanical Gardens and several Charles University buildings in Albertov, as well as the Baroque Villa America.\n\nThe centre of Nusle is Náměstí bratři Synků, where trams connect I.P.Pavlova and Charles Square.

He studied at the universities of Breslau and Bonn and was ordained a priest at Cologne in 1834.\n\nIn the following year he accepted the chairs of exegesis and church history at the seminary of Posen. He defended with ardour the Archbishop of that city, Martin von Dunin, during his persecution by the Prussian government, became vicar-capitular, professor and regens at Hildesheim in 1845, and in 1853 was appointed to the chair of church history at the University of Freiburg (Breisgau); at the same time he was appointed an ecclesiastical councillor (\"geistlicher Rat\"). He held that post until his death at Freiburg.\n\nTogether with Ignaz von Döllinger, Alzog was instrumental in convoking the famous Munich assembly of Catholic scholars in 1863. He also took part, with Bishop Hefele and Bishop Haseberg, in the preparatory work of the First Vatican Council and voted in favor of the doctrine of Papal infallibility but against the opportuneness of its promulgation.\n\nAlzog's fame rests mainly on his \"Handbuch der Universal-Kirchengeschichte\" (Mainz, 1841, often reprinted under various titles; English translation by Pabisch and Byrne, \"Manual of universal church history\"; 4 volumes, 1900). Based upon the foundations laid by Johann Adam Möhler, this manual was generally accepted as the best exposition of Catholic views, in opposition to the Protestant manual by C. A. Hase, and was translated into several languages.\n\nHis \"Patrology\" went through four editions (1866–84), and his edition of the \"Oratio Apologetica\" of St. Gregory of Nazianzus reached a second edition. He was also a frequent contributor to various periodicals. Besides a host of minor writings on ecclesiastical subjects, and an active collaboration in the great Kirchenlexicon of Wetzer and Welte, Alzog was also the author of \"Grundriss der Patrologie\" (Freiburg, 1866, 4th ed. 1888), a scholarly work; though now superseded. He also wrote (1857) a Latin treatise on the relation of Greek and Latin studies to Christian theology, and the valuable work: \"Die deutschen Plenarien im 15 und zu Anfang des 16 Jahrhunderts\" (Freiburg, 1874).\n"}

Averoff (15 August 1815, Metsovo – 15 July 1899, Alexandria), alternately Jorgos Averof or Georgios Averof (in Greek: Γεώργιος Αβέρωφ), was an Aromanian businessman and philanthropist. He is one of the great national benefactors of Greece. Born in the town of Metsovo (Epirus, Greece, then Ottoman Empire) Averoff moved to Alexandria while still young. He was known through most of his life for founding numerous schools in both Egypt and Greece.\n\nGeorge Averoff was Aromanian. He moved to Cairo, Egypt, in 1837 to work in a shop run by his brother, Anastasios. Thanks to his bold tactics and business activities he became the biggest merchant in Egypt. At the same time he participated in banking and real estate (buying and leasing land) while, thanks to his many riverboats travelling up and down the Nile, he managed to dominate Egypt’s domestic and foreign trade.\n\nThe Greek historian Antonios Chaldeos, who has written his PhD thesis about the history of the Greeks in Sudan, suggests that based on local histories in Sudan that Averoff was heavily involved in slave-trade there. In fact, the Omdurman quarter of \"Abu Ruf\", where historically the slave-market was situated, is still today named after him.\n\nHis business activities resulted his accumulating vast wealth, which he used to donate to charity and common good purposes. His charity work included significant donations for the development of educational and other infrastructure projects for the Greek communities of Alexandria, Metsovo, Athens and for the Greek state in general. Among them, the most notable ones were the founding of the School of Agriculture in Larisa, the construction of the Evelpidon Military Academy, the donation to the Athens Conservatory, the donation for the refurbishment of the Panathenian Stadium (raised by another two Aromanian benefactors), where the first modern Olympic Games were held, the completion of the National Technical University of Athens and the donation for building of the namesake flagship of the Greek Navy.\n\nThe restoration of the Panathenian Stadium for the 1896 Summer Olympics was done at the request of Crown Prince Constantine. The stadium was refurbished in 1895, its second refurbishment in the 19th century, using white marble from Mount Penteli pursuant to Averoff's request. The cost was initially estimated at 585,000 drachmas but eventually reached 920,000 drachmas. Averoff also served as a member of the reception committee for the foreign competitors at the Games.\n\nAveroff died in Alexandria in 1899. In gratitude for his generous donations and services, the Greek state declared him a Major National Benefactor and commissioned a marble statue of him which was placed in front of the Panathenian Stadium. It remains there today. On 12 March 1910, the armoured cruiser flagship of the Hellenic Navy, \"Georgios Averof\", was named in his honour, thanks to a bequest of 300,000 GBP (2,500,000 Gold francs) left to the navy by the terms of his Will & Testament.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2209641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209641", "title": "Astrid Varnay", "text": "Astrid Varnay\n\nIbolyka Astrid Maria Varnay (25 April 1918 – 4 September 2006) was a Swedish-born American dramatic soprano of Hungarian descent. She spent most of her career in the United States and Germany. She was one of the leading Wagnerian heroic sopranos of her generation. Her voice on record is readily recognisable by its fiery tone and seemingly limitless upper register.\n\nBoth her parents were Hungarian and born in small towns in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but she was born in Stockholm, where her parents were living during part of World War I. During a Da Capo interview in 1988 Varnay claimed that although she was born in Stockholm, her ancestry was Hungarian, French and German. Her mother, Maria Junghans (who changed her name to Javor when she took to the stage as a singer), born October 15, 1889, was a noted coloratura soprano with acoustic recordings to her credit. Her father was Alexander Varnay (born September 11, 1889), a spinto tenor. Opera was the family business, and Varnay grew up backstage at the world's opera houses. Her father founded, and both parents ran, the Opera Comique in Kristiania (later Oslo), (1918–1921). During one performance, she was swaddled in the lower drawer of the dressing room chest of drawers of the young Kirsten Flagstad.\n\nThe family moved to Argentina, then New York City, where her father died at age 35 in 1924. Two years later her mother married tenor Fortunato de Angelis and the family settled in New Jersey. Varnay had been studying to be a pianist but decided at age eighteen to become a singer and had intensive vocal lessons with her mother.\n\nA year later, Flagstad arranged for her to start preparing roles with Metropolitan Opera staff conductor and coach Hermann Weigert (1890–1955). By the age of 22 she knew Hungarian, German, English, French and Italian and her repertoire consisted of fifteen leading dramatic soprano roles, eleven of which were Wagnerian parts. She also had formidable mezzo-soprano capability, which she displayed in performances as Ortrud in \"Lohengrin\" and Klytemnestra in \"Elektra\".\n\nShe made her sensational debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 6 December 1941 in a broadcast performance singing Sieglinde in Wagner's \"Die Walküre\", substituting for the indisposed Lotte Lehmann with almost no rehearsal. This was her first appearance in a leading role, and it was a triumph. Six days later she replaced the ailing Helen Traubel as Brünnhilde in the same opera. Varnay and Weigert became closer and were married in 1944. It was also at this time that she had lessons with former Metropolitan Opera tenor, Paul Althouse.\n\nIn 1948, she made her debut at Covent Garden and in 1951 in Florence as Lady Macbeth. In that year she also made her debut at Bayreuth after Flagstad, who had declined the invitation to Bayreuth, recommended that Wieland Wagner engage Varnay. She sang at Bayreuth for the next seventeen years, and appeared regularly at the Metropolitan until 1956.\n\nShe left when it was clear that the Met director Rudolf Bing did not appreciate her, and went on to become a mainstay of the world's other great opera houses, especially in Germany, in Wagner and Strauss but also several Verdi and other roles. She had already made Munich her home, where audiences liked her.\n\nIn 1969, she gave up her repertoire of heavy dramatic soprano roles and began a new career singing mezzo roles. After being the world's leading Elektra for over twenty years, she now established herself as a great interpreter of Klytemnestra. The role of Herodias in \"Salome\" became her most often-performed role: 236 performances. She returned to the Metropolitan in 1974 and last appeared there in Weill's \"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\" in 1979. In 1975 she appeared as Herodias in the production of Salome with Teresa Stratas which was filmed with the Vienna Philharmonic and directed by Gotz Friedrich.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, character roles now became Varnay's metier. Her last appearance on stage was in Munich in 1995, fifty-five years after her Metropolitan debut. In 1998, she published her autobiography \"Fifty-Five Years in Five Acts: My Life in Opera\", written with Donald Arthur (German title is \"Hab' mir's gelobt\").\n\nIn 2004, a documentary about her life and first New York career entitled \"Never Before\" received acclaim in the USA. Her recordings of Strauss heroines such as Elektra and Salome along with the Wagnerian roles are among the treasures of the medium, while transcriptions of broadcast performances of her great roles document her art in sound, and a few video recordings of her late career preserve evidence of her acting ability. Varnay died in Munich on 4 September 2006 at age 88.\n\nWagner: \"Der Fliegende Holländer\" – Chorus and Orchestra of the Bayreuth Festival\n\nWagner: \"Lohengrin\" – Chorus and Orchestra of the Bayreuth Festival\n\nWagner: \"Götterdämmerung\" – Chorus and Orchestra of the Bayreuth Festival\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

In 1955 the Dominican Sisters of Amityville founded Molloy Catholic College. It was established as a women's college appointing Mother Anselma Ruth, O.P., Ph.D., as the first president. A year later the first institutional building called Quealy Hall opened. Soon after, Mother Bernadette de Lourdes, O.P., was appointed as the second president followed by the opening of Kellenburg Hall. In 1959 the first commencement ceremony took place celebrating the first graduating class. In 1971 its name was changed to Molloy College. In 1972 it began accepting men into the nursing program and in 1982 became fully coeducational.\n\nMolloy College offers over 60 clubs and organizations. Some are founded on academics but others are centered around a cultural theme.\n\n50.8% of four-year students actually graduate in four years. 71.8 graduate within 6 years. 77% of white students graduate in six years. 55.6% of Hispanic students graduate within 6 years. 50% of African-American students graduate within six years.\n\nMolloy has three residence halls that house nearly 350 students, Maria Regina, Fitzgerald, and Bogner Hall, which opened in August, 2019.\nDorms are co-ed but the halls and wings are separated by gender.

{"id": "2209652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209652", "title": "Canal Town", "text": "Canal Town\n\nCanal Town is the title of a 1944 novel by Samuel Hopkins Adams.\n\nThe novel is set in the 1820s in the town of Palmyra, New York, near Rochester, located on the Erie Canal. The novel opens in 1820, when the construction of the Erie Canal had just begun, but has not reached Palmyra, and most of the town is looking forward to the economic boom the Canal is expected to bring.\n\nDuring the course of the book, Adams depicts the changes in the daily life brought about by the construction of the canal. By the close of the book, citizens in Palmyra are regularly and casually travelling to Rochester via packet boat on the canal, or to New York by canal packet to Albany and thence by steam packet down the Hudson.\n\nOn publication, a \"New York Times\" review by Catharine Brody noted that the book recalls the Erie Canal novels of Walter D. Edmonds, whom Adams acknowledges in his introduction. In fact, Edmonds allowed Adams to use his notebooks as background for the novel. \n\nThe book is constructed around a single plot device, a case that a Dr. David Little reported to the Albany County Medical Society in the early 19th century. Brody called the incident \"a truthful old-wives' tale.\" \n\nThe chief protagonist is a young doctor, Horace Amlie. He is intelligent and dedicated, willing to treat both wealthy and indigent, and willing to accept barter in lieu of cash when necessary. He knows of the latest advances in medical science, such as vaccination against smallpox, and comes into conflict with an established doctor who prefers older treatments such as bleeding. Brody called him \"an Arrowsmith in a high beaver hat.\"\n\nAmlie visits a settlement called Poverty's Pinch, treats the sick, and pays respectful attention to an old woman named Quaila Crego who practices folk medicine. \n\nWork on the canal is constantly interrupted by sickness and fever among the workers. He asks Crego whether the fever has broken out in the Pinch and takes notice when she says \"It will, when the black moskeeter stands on her head.\"\n\nAmlie's dedication brings him into melodramatic conflict with landowners who resent his efforts to enforce public sanitation, and with a wealthy and powerful landowner named Genter Latham.\n\nAmlie becomes acquainted with a spunky adolescent girl named Araminta Jerrold and her best friend, Genter Latham's daughter Wealthia. Araminta admires Amlie and it comes as no surprise to the reader when she and Horace are married later.\n\nA good portion of the plot turns on a romantic situation involving Genter Latham's daughter, Wealthia. It seems obvious to the reader that Wealthia is having an affair with a dashing canal boat operator, Silverhorn Ramsey. She is also engaged to one Kinsey Hayne. \n\nDr. Amlie perceives that Wealthia is pregnant, and assumes that the father is Hayne. Amlie is concerned about the possibility that Wealthia may seek \"assistance\" from folk healers in Poverty Pinch, or may travel to Rochester for an \"illegal operation.\" Eventually he informs Wealthia's father, who is furious at the aspersions cast on his daughter. Nine months elapse and there is no birth. Amlie is bewildered because he was certain of his diagnosis, and equally certain that Wealthia has not had an abortion.\n\nNew York Times reviewer Brody says that the reader will \"probably stay up the rest of the night\" to discover \"the resolving of a first-class medical mystery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Latham resolves to ruin Amlie financially and run him out of town. He succeeds in having Amlie's license to practice medicine revoked. Through a loophole in the law, the revocation is unenforceable on the water of the canal itself, and Amlie manages to eke out a precarious living travelling up and down the canal in a boat, seeing patients only on board his vessel. \n\nWithout Amlie's public-health efforts, sanitary conditions in Palmyra deteriorate, and there is an epidemic of typhus, to which Wealthia falls victim and dies. Unable to stand not knowing how he could have been mistaken in his diagnosis, Amlie and a collaborator exhume Wealthia, and discover that she has experienced a rare condition, called a lithopedion or \"stone baby,\" in which a fetus dies in the womb but becomes calcified rather than being expelled.\n\nAmlie confronts Latham with this evidence, Latham acknowledges Amlie's integrity, numerous complications are quickly resolved in the closing pages, and Amlie and his wife Araminta live happily ever after.\n\n\"Putative Virgin,\" by Catharine Brody; \"The New York Times,\" April 23, 1944, page BR6.\n"}

Haultain was still the first premier of the NWT. That title was given by legislation passed in 1897. He was the last premier of the Northwest Territories until 1980.\n\nThere were three big issues in this election, provincial rights and how to divide the provinces.\n\nThe second issue was the transfer of education, from the federal to the territorial level, this was Haultain's personal project, unfortunately for the Territories, that power would not be turned over until 1970.\n\nThe third issue, was the territories deficit budget, the territory was facing huge pressures from a rapidly increasing population in all parts of the territory. Earlier in 1898 the territorial government tried to exert control over liquor revenue in the Klondike, since it was footing the bill for increased services and policing. The federal government however interfered and delt a huge blow, when it carved the Yukon out of the Northwest Territories and appointed a council loyal to the federal government to gain control.\n\nThis was the first general election in which the election was contested along party lines in Northwest Territories. Frederick W. A. G. Haultain would sustain the governing Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party in coalition with James Hamilton Ross who was a member of the Hautain cabinet but a Liberal member. Robert Brett remained leader of the official opposition.\n\nPolitical parties were still controversial in this election as noted in the \"Calgary Herald\" editorial from 17 November 1898 Weekly edition, that debated the pros and cons of the bringing the \"Dominion party lines\" to the territorial legislature.\n\nFor complete electoral history, see individual districts\n\n\n"}

The game was released as a free beta download off of the Nexon Inc. website but was later discontinued in North America due to low playerbase. Released in 1999, it was one of the first free-to-play games using a microtransaction revenue model. The game remained available in South Korea, Japan, and Singapore but the Singapore and Japan servers were later shut down as well in December 2004.\n\nAfter signing up and logging in, players would be redirected to a lobby, where they could chat (limited, a more full-featured chat was available in player-created chat rooms) with other online players and view the currently open games. The games all were trivia-oriented or puzzle games such as \"Reversi\". Once the game they wished to play was open, all interested players could join the game by clicking on its button. Games supported anywhere between two and thirty-two players. Players were rewarded for doing well in the games with an in-game currency which they could use to buy items and clothes for their characters. Most items did nothing but make your avatar look good and show how smart you are, thus allowing you to gain the respect of other players. Other items, however, powered you up in some of the games, such as sunglasses in the true-false game. A player's overall score in the games was measured by an IQ meter. Most items required a certain IQ score to be attained before the player was allowed to purchase that item.\n\n\"Note: None of the names may be accurate, this is due to the lack of a current English website.\n\nSeveral games were available in \"QuizQuiz\", most of them involving trivia or puzzle elements. Several versions of the games were available.\n\nThe Survival Olla Olla Game consisted of nine players all lined up in buckets hanging over a body of water containing crocodiles for the trivia game, or sharks for the typing game. The buckets would all start in the middle of the screen and when the game began. In the trivia game, multiple choice questions would be asked by the server and would be answered by the players using the function keys (f1-f4). If a player got the question right, his or her bucket would be raised, otherwise, it would be lowered. If the player's bucket reached the water, that player would be eliminated and booted back to the lobby with a slight IQ deduction. If a player reached the top, that player would be considered the winner, in some versions, if nobody reached the top, the last player alive would win. The winner would gain IQ. The game would continue until all players had either reached the top or the bottom. Players would often share the answers with each other in an effort for all players to gain IQ. There would also be an incentive for players who know the right answers to give false answers on purpose so as to cause other players to fall. The typing game had pretty much the same concept, except instead of answering trivia questions, a sentence would be shown on the screen and the players would compete to see who could type it out the fastest. If you have a typing error in your sentence, your bucket would drop. If you type the sentence correct, your bucket would rise. The person who types the sentence the fastest will see their buckets rise faster than the others.\n\nIn \"OX\", thirty-two players would enter a large board as small lingt-blue bubble avatars. The board would have a large X on one side and a large O on the other. After a time the game would begin, whether thirty-two players were present or not. 'True or False' questions would be asked and players would need to click on the side they wished to go to, X for false and O for true. Certain items would allow your avatar to move much faster, allowing last minute decisions, or more commonly, switch answers at the last minute fooling other players. Newer players would often follow other players who took the initiative to move first, so faster and crueler players would purposely fool the newbies for fun. An alternate version was available where the opposite answer must be selected, called \"XO\". In this version, the board was halloween themed and evil laughter could be heard at the start of the game.\n\n\"Virus\" was a game very similar to \"Reversi\" or \"Ataxx\" where four players, two on each team would face off, taking turns with their team mate to outwit the other team. Players could chat privately with their team mate or publicly with the everyone.\n\nIn a game which looked very similar to a \"StarCraft\" themed \"Jeopardy!\" stage, three players would stand behind podiums which were themed like the Terran, Protoss, and Zerg HUDs in \"StarCraft\" and be asked questions about computer and video games of all genres from all eras.\n\nLove Love\n\nAnother game which was on it was LoveLove, which was a dating game where users would be put with someone who they voted for, and when that was over the user would start quizzes.\n\nContrary to Nexon's assessment that the player base of the North American beta version was low, there was in fact a large community surrounding the game that mostly resembled a clique structure. Like many other massively multiplayer games, clans were formed in QuizQuiz. Unlike other games where clans are used as a way to obtain people to hunt with or gain experience with, clans in the North American version of QuizQuiz were social hubs where a newcomer to the game could meet new people and chat.

Kevin Fagan created the strip in 1979 and still remains the sole writer and artist. The strip centers on the Drabble family, and is set in a fictionalized version of the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the strip was nearly pulled from the \"Boston Herald\". A grassroots effort, spearheaded by Robert S. Frisiello, Jr. convinced the paper to keep the strip running.\n\nRalph: The father of the family, he worked initially as a pro-wrestler, and later as the original mall cop. Ralph has been working as a retirement village security guard and in August 2011 began a job as a TSA screener at Polecat International Airport. He constantly overeats and watches classic movies, and his hero is Ward Cleaver. One strip had him going to the doctors office to have his cholesterol checked, whereupon the doctor promptly called the Guinness Book of World Records. Has an alter ego as a pro wrestler. He is also famous for his \"Glare,\" which strikes fear in just about anyone who looks him in the eye. He has a brother Fred.\n\nJune: The mother of the family and the most responsible one. Always called \"Honeybunch\" by Ralph. Not without her own faults, Ralph frequently complains about her spending habits and when he set up a Halloween house of horrors, he included something meant to scare just her-the house telephone off the hook. She's shown to be a sci-fi fan and in one strip attended a Star Trek convention in costume. She also likes to sing along with her iPod, which Ralph often mistakes for the cat yowling or the smoke alarm going off. She also has the habit of finishing Ralph's sentences, which greatly annoys him. Honeybunch always wears her apron, even when they go out. In 2018, she is starting a photography business.\n\nNorman: The sweet, but naive and dim-witted 19-year-old college student. He's the older son in the family. A bad case of arrested adolescence, he still sleeps on the top of a bunk bed with his younger brother Patrick and still asks his father to check the closet for monsters (though in one strip he managed to work up the courage to do it himself). In the fall of 2010, however, he moves into a dorm at college. He is also embarrassed about going to the beach because of his farmer's tan, and in one strip he looked like a farmer driving a tractor. He was also temporarily married to Wendy in Las Vegas, but that marriage was annulled because they were married by someone who was not an Elvis impersonator.\n\nPatrick: The genius younger brother of Norman. He was almost always dressed in a gi, but in early 2018, is almost always dressed in a hockey uniform and carrying around a hockey stick.\n\nPenny: The youngest child of the family.\n\nWendy Fleetwood: Norman's college classmate. Norman has been trying to score a date with her since the beginning of the comic strip. She was also temporarily married to Norman in Las Vegas, but that marriage was annulled because they were married by someone who was not an Elvis impersonator. A running joke is that she often says \"Norman, run!\", which makes him flee and allows her to avoid a boring conversation. In the January 25, 2004 strip, it was revealed that her last name is Fleetwood.\n\nNo-Neck: A good friend of Ralph, who literally has no neck. He also works as a security guard and is slightly dumber than Ralph.\n\nNeil: College student friend of Norman's.\n\nStu: Another college student friend of Norman's.\n\nLeonard: Another college student friend of Norman's.\n\nL. Floyd Gargle: a neighbor with a mutual loathing of Ralph.\n\nWally: The Drabbles' hyperactive dachshund. Wally was introduced in Christmas 1998 when Norman gave Ralph a dog because he couldn't afford something.\n\nBob: The Drabbles' duck. To protect him from the Neighborhood Homeowners Association, Norman lies and tells everyone that Bob is a rare South-American parrot who takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival.\n\nOogie: The Drabbles' cat, who Ralph does not like, but June adores.\n\nGeorge W. Steinbauer: The Drabbles' next door neighbor who does not like Ralph, and Ralph feels the same way. He and Ralph constantly argue and compete contentiously. Has a daughter named Opal and a son named Troy.\n\nBrtny: A girl at Norman's college who seems to have a crush on him. She communicates through texting. Norman appears to like her as well.\n\nNorma: A young woman about Norman's age whom he always bumps into when he wishes he could meet the perfect girl. After several false starts they finally get together. Nicknamed \"Echo\" for her similarities to Norman.\n\n"}

It is one of several phosphides of calcium, being described as the salt-like material composed of Ca and P. Other, more exotic calcium phosphides have the formula CaP, CaP, CaP, and CaP.\n\nCaP has the appearance of red-brown crystalline powder or grey lumps. Its trade name is Photophor for the incendiary use or Polytanol for the use as rodenticide.\n\nIt may be formed by reaction of the elements, but it is more commonly prepared by carbothermal reduction of calcium phosphate:\n\nThe structure of the room temperature form of CaP has not been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. A high temperature phase has been characterized by Rietveld refinement. Ca centers are octahedral.\n\nMetal phosphides are used as a rodenticide. A mixture of food and calcium phosphide is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic gas phosphine. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents immune to many of the common warfarin-type (anticoagulant) poisons have appeared. Other pesticides similar to calcium phosphide are zinc phosphide and aluminium phosphide.\n\nCalcium phosphide is also used in fireworks, torpedoes, self-igniting naval pyrotechnic flares, and various water-activated ammunition. During the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Kingsford Smith used separate buoyant canisters of calcium carbide and calcium phosphide as naval flares lasting up to ten minutes. It is speculated that calcium phosphide—made by boiling bones in urine, within a closed vessel—was an ingredient of some ancient Greek fire formulas.\n\nCalcium phosphide is a common impurity in calcium carbide, which may cause the resulting phosphine-contaminated acetylene to ignite spontaneously.\n\nOn contact with acids or water, the material releases phosphine, which is toxic and is readily ignited.\n\n"}

The Einstein \"A\" coefficients are related to the rate of spontaneous emission of light, and the Einstein \"B\" coefficients are related to the absorption and stimulated emission of light.\n\nIn physics, one thinks of a spectral line from two viewpoints.\n\nAn emission line is formed when an atom or molecule makes a transition from a particular discrete energy level of an atom, to a lower energy level , emitting a photon of a particular energy and wavelength. A spectrum of many such photons will show an emission spike at the wavelength associated with these photons.\n\nAn absorption line is formed when an atom or molecule makes a transition from a lower, , to a higher discrete energy state, , with a photon being absorbed in the process. These absorbed photons generally come from background continuum radiation (the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation) and a spectrum will show a drop in the continuum radiation at the wavelength associated with the absorbed photons.\n\nThe two states must be bound states in which the electron is bound to the atom or molecule, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a \"bound–bound\" transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely (\"bound–free\" transition) into a continuum state, leaving an ionized atom, and generating continuum radiation.\n\nA photon with an energy equal to the difference between the energy levels is released or absorbed in the process. The frequency at which the spectral line occurs is related to the photon energy by Bohr's frequency condition where denotes Planck's constant.\n\nAn atomic spectral line refers to emission and absorption events in a gas in which formula_1 is the density of atoms in the upper-energy state for the line, and formula_2 is the density of atoms in the lower-energy state for the line.\n\nThe emission of atomic line radiation at frequency may be described by an emission coefficient formula_3 with units of energy/(time × volume × solid angle). \"ε dt dV dΩ\" is then the energy emitted by a volume element formula_4 in time formula_5 into solid angle formula_6. For atomic line radiation,\n\nwhere formula_8 is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, which is fixed by the intrinsic properties of the relevant atom for the two relevant energy levels.\n\nThe absorption of atomic line radiation may be described by an absorption coefficient formula_9 with units of 1/length. The expression \"κ' dx\" gives the fraction of intensity absorbed for a light beam at frequency while traveling distance \"dx\". The absorption coefficient is given by\n\nwhere formula_11 and formula_12 are the Einstein coefficients for photon absorption and induced emission respectively. Like the coefficient formula_8, these are also fixed by the intrinsic properties of the relevant atom for the two relevant energy levels. For thermodynamics and for the application of Kirchhoff's law, it is necessary that the total absorption be expressed as the algebraic sum of two components, described respectively by formula_11 and formula_12, which may be regarded as positive and negative absorption, which are, respectively, the direct photon absorption, and what is commonly called stimulated or induced emission.\n\nThe above equations have ignored the influence of the spectroscopic line shape. To be accurate, the above equations need to be multiplied by the (normalized) spectral line shape, in which case the units will change to include a 1/Hz term.\n\nUnder conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, the number densities formula_1 and formula_2, the Einstein coefficients, and the spectral energy density provide sufficient information to determine the absorption and emission rates.\n\nThe number densities formula_1 spectrum and formula_2 are set by the physical state of the gas in which the spectral line occurs, including the local spectral radiance (or, in some presentations, the local spectral radiant energy density). When that state is either one of strict thermodynamic equilibrium, or one of so-called \"local thermodynamic equilibrium\", then the distribution of atomic states of excitation (which includes formula_1 and formula_2) determines the rates of atomic emissions and absorptions to be such that Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative absorptivity and emissivity holds. In strict thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field is said to be black-body radiation and is described by Planck's law. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field does not have to be a black-body field, but the rate of interatomic collisions must vastly exceed the rates of absorption and emission of quanta of light, so that the interatomic collisions entirely dominate the distribution of states of atomic excitation. Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm the tendency to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. For example, in the atmosphere of the Sun, the great strength of the radiation dominates. In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, at altitudes over 100 km, the rarity of intermolecular collisions is decisive.\n\nIn the cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, but for other cases, (e.g. lasers) the calculation is more complicated.\n\nIn 1916, Albert Einstein proposed that there are three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line. The three processes are referred to as spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption. With each is associated an Einstein coefficient, which is a measure of the probability of that particular process occurring. Einstein considered the case of isotropic radiation of frequency and spectral energy density .\n\nHilborn has compared various formulations for derivations for the Einstein coefficients, by various authors. For example, Herzberg works with irradiance and wavenumber. Yariv works with energy per unit volume per unit frequency interval; this is how the present account is formulated. Mihalas & Weibel-Mihalas work with radiance and frequency; also Chandrasekhar; also Goody & Yung; Loudon uses angular frequency and radiance.\n\nSpontaneous emission is the process by which an electron \"spontaneously\" (i.e. without any outside influence) decays from a higher energy level to a lower one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient \"A\" (\"s\"), which gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy formula_22 will decay spontaneously to state 1 with energy formula_23, emitting a photon with an energy . Due to the energy-time uncertainty principle, the transition actually produces photons within a narrow range of frequencies called the spectral linewidth. If formula_24 is the number density of atoms in state \"i\" , then the change in the number density of atoms in state 2 per unit time due to spontaneous emission will be\n\nThe same process results in increasing of the population of the state 1:\n\nStimulated emission (also known as induced emission) is the process by which an electron is induced to jump from a higher energy level to a lower one by the presence of electromagnetic radiation at (or near) the frequency of the transition. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, this process must be regarded as negative absorption. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient formula_12 (m J s), which gives the probability per unit time per unit spectral radiance of the radiation field that an electron in state 2 with energy formula_22 will decay to state 1 with energy formula_23, emitting a photon with an energy . The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to induced emission will be\n\nwhere formula_31 denotes the radiance in a 1 Hz bandwidth of the isotropic radiation field at the frequency of the transition (see Planck's law).\n\nStimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the development of the laser. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the present case of isotropic radiation.\n\nAbsorption is the process by which a photon is absorbed by the atom, causing an electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient formula_11 (m J s), which gives the probability per unit time per unit spectral radiance of the radiation field that an electron in state 1 with energy formula_23 will absorb a photon with an energy and jump to state 2 with energy formula_22. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to absorption will be\n\nThe Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities per time associated with each atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part. Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermodynamic equilibrium will be valid universally.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have detailed balancing as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:\n\nAlong with detailed balancing, at temperature we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in Planck's law of black body radiation to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.\n\nFrom Boltzmann distribution we have for the number of excited atomic species \"i\":\n\nwhere \"n\" is the total number density of the atomic species, excited and unexcited, \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, \"T\" is the temperature, formula_38 is the degeneracy (also called the multiplicity) of state \"i\", and \"Z\" is the partition function. From Planck's law of black-body radiation at temperature we have for the spectral radiance (radiance is energy per unit time per unit solid angle per unit projected area, when integrated over an appropriate spectral interval) at frequency \n\nwhere\n\nwhere formula_41 is the speed of light and formula_42 is Planck's constant.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation of detailed balancing and remembering that yields\n\nseparating to\n\nThe above equation must hold at any temperature, so\n\nand\n\nTherefore, the three Einstein coefficients are interrelated by\n\nand\n\nWhen this relation is inserted into the original equation, one can also find a relation between formula_8 and formula_11, involving Planck's law.\n\nThe oscillator strength formula_51 is defined by the following relation to the cross section formula_52 for absorption:\n\nwhere formula_54 is the electron charge, formula_55 is the electron mass, and formula_56 and formula_57 are normalized distribution functions in frequency and angular frequency respectively. \nThis allows all three Einstein coefficients to be expressed in terms of the single oscillator strength associated with the particular atomic spectral line:\n\n\n"}

Bai Mudan is sometimes preferred by white tea drinkers for its fuller flavor and greater potency than the other major type of white tea, Bai Hao Yinzhen. The latter is made purely with leaf shoots, and so it is comparatively softer and more subtle. The typical taste of Bai Mudan is a result of both the processing and the tea plant cultivars employed in the production.\n\nThe family of tea cultivars used in producing Bai Mudan are the \"Dai Bai\" varieties. In eastern Fujian, the cultivar Fuding Dai Bai is used. In northern Fujian, the Zhenghe Dai Bai cultivar is used. The differences in the plant yield two distinct styles of Bai Mudan: the Fuding variety and the Zhenghe variety.\n\nGenuine Bai Mudan is a white tea; therefore, it is a slightly oxidized tea. The plucks are sun-withered for an extended period of time and then piled briefly for oxidation, during which enzymes of the tea leaves interact with other constituents to form new materials that result in the final taste and aromatic character of the tea. Depending on the weather, conditions of the pluck and the taste style requirements of the finished products, the sunning may last between 1 and 3 days and the piling between one half and 3 hours.\n\nThe leaves are then baked to dry for packing. The handling of the leaves remains gentle and non-intrusive throughout the process to avoid breakage of the cellular structure. This is needed because once the cell walls are physically broken, oxidation of the leaves quickens and the quality will be compromised.\n\nAlthough the processing steps are simpler than those for other teas, the long process and the variable factors during which are key cost factors. For example, a sudden rainstorm during the lengthy withering can be destructive.\n\nA very mild peony aroma and a floral aroma are noticed when brewing the tea. The tea is best brewed with good mineral water and at 70 °C to 80 °C (158 °F to 176 °F). The brew is a very pale green or golden color. The flavor is fruity; stronger than Silver Needle, yet not as strong as Shou Mei. The finest quality should have a shimmering clear infusion with a delicate lingering fragrance and a fresh, mellow, sweet taste devoid of astringency, and grassy flavors.\n\n\n\n"}

Because three of the four band members had the first name Don, the band was also sometimes jokingly nicknamed \"Dons of Freedom\".\n\nTheir self-titled debut album was released in 1988 on Slash Records, and was supported by a cross-Canada concert tour. The album was marked by a hybrid rock-funk style which was described by critics as a cross between Led Zeppelin and Gang of Four.

She was best known for her association in two films with film director Abel Ferrara: \"Ms .45\" (1981), in which she starred, and \"Bad Lieutenant\" (1992), for which she co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nLund was born Zoë Tamerlis on February 9, 1962 to mother Barbara Lekberg, an American sculptor of Swedish descent, and Victor Tamerlis, who was of Romanian descent. She dropped out of college.\n\nAt a young age, Lund was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp. \"I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across.\" Lund was also a pianist.\n\nLund made her debut in Abel Ferrara's \"Ms .45\" (1981). She was only 17 years old during the making of the film.\n\nLund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: \"In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes. Being that my face is on camera, without dialogue, for something like 98% of the time, I was involved very much. As to the film being pro-woman, I go beyond that by saying that the film is as much pro-woman as it is pro-garment worker, whatever.\"\n\n\"In any case, Miss Tamerlis's exoticism is of the fashion-magazine kind, as opposed to the real kind,\" Janet Maslin wrote in her review of the film. \"So she isn't very frightening, and neither is much of what she does.\"\n\nAlthough it was not an immediate success, \"Ms .45\" eventually became a cult film in later years.\n\nNot wanting to become part of what she called \"Abel's stable\" she marked her own career path.\n\nThree years after \"Ms .45\" was released in 1981, Lund got her second chance to star in a movie, this time in a role that required her to play two different roles. \"Special Effects\" was written and directed by Larry Cohen. In it he cast Lund as a wannabe starlet who is murdered on film by a fallen director portrayed by Eric Bogosian, who then finds a lookalike to take her place in the movie he decides to make around the snuff footage. As the starlet, Lund's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections (Lund's character in \"Ms. 45\" was mute).\n\nLund also appeared in an episode of \"Miami Vice\", which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled \"\". She later appeared in \"The Houseguest\" (1989) and Temístocles López's \"Exquisite Corpses\" (1989). Lund even appeared in the ABC series, \"Hothouse\".\n\nDespite not wanting to become part of what she calls \"Abel's stable\", Lund collaborated with Ferrara again on \"Bad Lieutenant\" (1992), which she co-wrote. Lund also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin.\n\nAccording to Lund, \"There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech – which is crucial to the Lieutenant – was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go.\"\n\nLund said in an interview that \"Bad Lieutenant\" was the most personal film she had ever acted in. She also claims in another interview that she wrote the screenplay all by herself. She also claimed that she co-directed several scenes in \"Bad Lieutenant\".\n\nAs a director, Lund made two shorts: \"The Innocent Tribunal\" (1986) and \"Hot Ticket\" (1996). She also wrote the pilot episode of \"\".\n\nLund worked on unproduced screenplays about famous drug addicts such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi. Lund attempted to publish several novels, including \"Curfew: USA\" and \"490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse\". A film adaptation of \"Curfew: USA\" and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming. Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Lund's works included \"Last Night of Summer\" and \"Free Will and Testament\".\n\nAlthough she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary \"The Self-Destruction of Gia\".\n\nAccording to Abel Ferrara: \"...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.\" However, her death led to a fifteen-year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film \"Pasolini\" (2014) was released. In 1996, Lund also wrote the first draft of \"New Rose Hotel\" (1998).\n\nLund lived and worked under many names such as Vanessa Lancaster and Tamara Tamarind.\n\nLund was unapologetic about her heroin addiction. She wrote at length about heroin and advocated it for legal recreational use in the USA, as well as romanticized its effects. \"She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin,\" Ferrara said on her heroin addiction. \"...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died. She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her.\"\n\n\"I've known a lot of serious drug users,\" Richard Hell, a friend of Lund's, recalled in 2002, \"but Zoë was Queen. You've got to admire someone as committed to it as she was. She didn't just LOVE heroin, she believed in it.\"\n\nLund said in an interview, \"...I never lost my religion. I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story. What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth. We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace.\"\n\nFrom 1979 to 1986, she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot. Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of \"Bad Lieutenant\". Laurot also co-wrote Lund's book \"Curfew: USA\". After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Lund's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas.\n\nIn 1986, she started dating her future husband, Robert Lund. They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Lunds reportedly owned \"dozens of roaming pet rats.\" The couple were married later that year. That same year, Lund got an abortion.\n\nAlthough they never got divorced, Lund and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with \"her new boyfriend\" until her death in 1999.\n\nLund died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997. She was 37.\n\nIn 2007, experimental group Bodega System released the album \"Blood Pyx\". The cover features Zoë as photographed by her widower, Robert Lund. \nIn the early 2000s, \"American Hardcore\" director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Lund's life: \"Zoe XO\" (2004) and \"Zoe Rising\" (2009). In the former short, Robert Lund discusses their relationship, while in the latter Zoë's mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood.\n\nAbel Ferrara said of Lund in a 2012 interview, \"Zoe was a brilliant, creative person before the drugs, the drugs just killed her.\"\n\n"}

He became first lieutenant in 1842, captain in 1849, and major on the Great General Staff in 1853, whence after seven years he went to the Ministry of War. He was soon afterwards promoted colonel, and commanded a regiment of Guard infantry up to 1864, when he became a major-general after the Second Schleswig War.\n\nAlvensleben commanded a brigade of guards in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. At the action of Soor (Burkersdorf) on 28 June, he distinguished himself greatly, and at the Battle of Königgrätz where he led the advanced guard of the Guards Corps, his energy and initiative were still more conspicuous. Soon afterwards he succeeded to the command of his division, General Wilhelm Hiller von Gärtringen having fallen in the battle; he was promoted lieutenant-general, and retained this command after the conclusion of peace, receiving in addition the order Pour le Mérite for his services.\n\nIn 1870, on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Alvensleben succeeded Prince Friedrich Karl in command of the III Army Corps, which formed part of the 2nd German army.

The regiment was disbanded following India's independence in 1947.\n\nOn reserve since the Boer War, they are most noted for their part (with members of the Calcutta Scottish) in Operation Creek against the German merchant ship, \"Ehrenfels\". The operation was organised by SOE's India Mission. It was kept covert, to avoid the political ramifications of contravening Portuguese neutrality in Goa, and was not revealed until thirty-five years afterwards, in 1978. The \"Ehrenfels\" was known to be transmitting information on Allied ship movements to U-boats from Mormugao harbour in Portugal's neutral territory of Goa.\n\nThe Light Horse embarked on the barge \"Phoebe\" at Calcutta and sailed around India to Goa. After the \"Ehrenfels\" was sunk in March 1943 by the team of British saboteurs, British intelligence dispatched an open message over the air falsely warning that the British would invade Goa. The crews of the other two German merchant ships in the harbour, the \"Drachenfels\" and \"Braunfels\", received the message and scuttled their ships in Goa's harbour in the belief that they were protecting their ships from capture by the British. Italian ships in the harbour were also destroyed.

{"id": "2209754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209754", "title": "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show", "text": "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show\n\n\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" is the fourteenth episode in the eighth season of the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 9, 1997. In the episode, \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" attempts to regain lost viewers by introducing a new character named Poochie, voiced by Homer. The episode is largely self-referential and satirizes the world of television production, fans of \"The Simpsons\", and the series itself. It was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore. Alex Rocco is a credited guest voice as Roger Meyers, Jr. for the third and final time (having previously provided the character's voice in \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\" and \"The Day the Violence Died\"); Phil Hartman also guest stars as Troy McClure. Poochie would become a minor recurring character and Comic Book Guy's catchphrase, \"Worst episode ever\", is introduced in this episode. \n\nWith \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", the show's 167th episode, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"The Flintstones\" in the number of episodes produced for a prime-time animated series.\n\nKrusty the Clown threatens to ditch \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" because the cartoon causes his ratings to nosedive during that segment of his show. Cartoon producer Roger Meyers convenes a focus group to discover why \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" has lost its appeal. In the focus group, Lisa explains that the show has lost its impact on audiences after being on the air for so long. \n\nMeyers decides that the cartoon needs a new character: Poochie, a dog with \"attitude\" who surfs, raps, and plays electric guitar. At Bart and Lisa's suggestion, Homer auditions for Poochie's voice and gets the part. To promote Poochie, he and voice actor June Bellamy make several publicity stops, where they encounter the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites his friends and relatives to watch the first \"Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\". However, the cartoon is full of asinine antics, with none of the show's flair or trademark violence. Unimpressed by the manic Poochie character, Homer's friends say little as they leave.\n\nMeyers decides to kill off Poochie, but Homer resolves to save him. At the next recording session, Homer goes off-script and implores the audience to give Poochie a chance. The show's production team appears moved by Homer's plea, but when the episode airs, Meyers has dubbed over Homer's voice: the new dialogue says that Poochie has \"died on the way back to his home planet\". The studio audience cheers as Krusty displays an affidavit swearing Poochie will never return. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the whole affair to the fickle nature of show business.\n\n\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode was conceived as a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had long been on the air, but was considered to be nearing its end. This was intended to show that \"The Simpsons\" could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the \"shock value\" it did in the early years. Before production of season eight began, several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis, in a bid to freshen up the series. The writers found the suggestion, usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series, amusing, therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope. Parallel to the episode's main plot, where Poochie is introduced on \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" to boost its ratings, the writers inserted the one-time character Roy, a college-aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons, with no explanation as to his character or presence, as a reference to the executives' proposal. Roy was originally conceived for the \"Time and Punishment\" segment of the season six episode \"Treehouse of Horror V\", living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities, as a second, teenage son in the family.\n\nCohen's initial vision for Poochie was that he would be annoying to fans because he was wealthy, aloof and unlikeable. In the episode's DVD commentary he read his script for the first cartoon featuring Itchy, Scratchy, and Poochie:\nAs with other episodes centering on the production of \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\", such as \"The Front\", the show's staff are shown. Almost all of them are based on the actual staff of \"The Simpsons\". In the first scene at the production table the person in the lower right corner, wearing a squid T-shirt, is Cohen. On the left side, the furthest away is Bill Oakley with Josh Weinstein next to him. Next to Weinstein is George Meyer, who is the writer who speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is supervising director David Silverman. As Silverman plays the tuba, one was drawn into the background of the scene. Other writers who appear include Dan McGrath, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Donick Cary, Ron Hauge, Ned Goldreyer, and Mike Scully, who had to be added in later, as the animators did not have a photo to use as a likeness.\n\nThis episode also features the first use of Comic Book Guy's catchphrase \"Worst. Episode. Ever.\", which was taken from the alt.tv.simpsons newsgroup.\n\nThis episode saw \"The Simpsons\" surpass \"The Flintstones\" for the number of episodes produced for an animated series. The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show \"fresh\" again. The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as \"jumping the shark\", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children who have grown up. This was the case with \"Oliver\" on \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"Luke Brower\" on \"Growing Pains\". The technique is also used in cartoons, notably with the addition of \"Scrappy-Doo\" to the \"Scooby-Doo\" animated series ten years after its debut. Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this by attempting to keep \"The Itchy and Scratchy Show\" and the Simpson family fresh respectively.\n\nAnother theme is the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view. They try to incorporate what they see as a rebellious character with the comment \"This is popular with the kids\", but the viewers later reject the character. The writers themselves are satirized in the episode, and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas.\n\nThe last theme is the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency. When Comic Book Guy sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes \"Worst episode ever\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart:\n\nEarlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy attend an in-store appearance as part of the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, \"Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?\" This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency.\n\nThe original opening couch gag shows a pastiche of the cover collage from the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which was first used earlier in the season for \"Bart After Dark\". Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the Flintstone family, recycled from the season four episode \"Kamp Krusty\", to mark \"The Simpsons\" surpassing \"The Flintstones\" as the longest-running animated series. Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes Fonzie calling the Cunninghams \"Mr. and Mrs. C\" on \"Happy Days\". Later, he decides to move in with \"two sexy ladies\", recalling Jack Tripper in \"Three's Company\". The backwards ball cap and untucked checkered shirt worn by Poochie or Roy closely resemble costuming used by the thematically similar \"Growing Pains\" character \"Luke Brower\". Homer hiding in the closet to hear what the network executives were planning to do with Poochie is a reference to Jay Leno reportedly eavesdropping on a conversation between NBC executives on whether he or David Letterman would replace Johnny Carson as the host of \"The Tonight Show\".\n\nItchy and Scratchy are based on \"Tom and Jerry\" and other cat-and-mouse cartoons. As a boy, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra-violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that. June Bellamy is a tribute to voice actress June Foray. In the episode, Bellamy claims that she provided the \"Beep, beep\" sound effect in the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons; in reality the phrase was voiced by Paul Julian.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" finished tied for 38th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 3–9, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8. It was the third-highest-rated show on the Fox Network that week.\n\nThis episode was placed 23rd on \"Entertainment Weekly\"s top 25 \"The Simpsons\" episodes list. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", praised \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", calling it \"a very neat episode which, like \"The Front\", is a good parody of the cartooning business.\" \n\nIn 2007, \"Vanity Fair\" named it the sixth-best episode in the show's history, describing it as \"a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of \"The Simpsons\" had declined over the years.\" \n\nTodd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece, stating it \"could easily be packaged and sold by [itself]\". \n\n\"Planet Simpson\" author Chris Turner describes the episode as \"the most contentious and direct counterattack \"The Simpsons\" ever unleashed on its fans\" and \"[harsh] satire of the working world of big-time TV production\". \n\nRobert Canning of \"IGN\" said it was \"laugh-out-loud funny\" and describing the introduction of Roy as \"a hilarious parody of a classic, overused television device.\"\n\nAlan Sepinwall of \"The Star Ledger\", in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired, praised the writers for not airing a \"very special\" episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking \"The Flintstones\". He noted \"[the episode is] so self-aware it put the best in-jokes on \"St. Elsewhere\" to shame.\" \n\nThe BBC named it as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show, noting, \"the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show.\" \n\nIn 2019, \"Time\" ranked the episode second in its list of 10 best \"Simpsons\" episodes picked by \"Simpsons\" experts.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Simpsons\" writers picked \"The Beagle Has Landed\" as one of their nine favorite \"Itchy & Stratchy\" episodes of all time.\n\nComic Book Guy's phrase \"Worst. Episode. Ever\" was named by \"The A.V. Club\" as a quote that could be used in everyday life, as well as being one of the most popular quotes from the show.\n\n\n"}

He was a lifelong resident of Nashville, Tennessee and was sports editor and later Vice-President of the \"Nashville Banner\" daily newspaper. His career spanned 70 years. He published three books of sports humor in the 1940s. Russell was a protégé and friend of famed sportswriter Grantland Rice.\n\nRussell is a member of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. One of his most enduring legacies was his influence on collegiate sports, specifically as Chairman of the Honors Court of the College Football Hall of Fame for 29 years. The Honors Court determines the inductees to the Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn in Wartrace, Tennessee, Russell attended Vanderbilt University Class of 1927 in Nashville. At Vanderbilt, Russell was a good student, a member of the Kappa chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, and a varsity baseball player. He played second base and pitched. He later attended Vanderbilt \"Law School\".\n\nIn 1929, Russell was hired for the police beat by the \"Nashville Banner\". The following year, Russell became the Sports Editor of the \"Banner\", replacing Ralph McGill. Russell would be a member of the \"Banner\" staff until the paper closed in 1998. Over the next 68 years, Russell wrote over 12,000 columns, mostly in a column named \"Sidelines\".\n\nRussell covered the major sports in America for over 65 years. His heyday was the Golden Age of sports—the 1930s to the 1950s—when newspapers were the principal form of media and news, before television and money became the central emphasis of modern sports. While Russell was always focused on covering Tennessee and southern athletics first, he nonetheless was well-known nationally and had a unique insight into the growth and expansion of athletics in the nation.\n\nThe sports and events he annually and regularly covered and contributed to were: college football; amateur and pro baseball; the Masters Golf Tournament; the Kentucky Derby; championship boxing; college football bowl games, including The Sugar Bowl and The Rose Bowl; and The Olympic Games (1960–1976).\n\nRussell gained national notoriety in the 1940s and 1950s for writing one of the most popular annual college football previews, the Pigskin Preview, for \"The Saturday Evening Post\", one of the most popular magazines of that day. He covered the major Bowl Games throughout the decades. Russell was one of the principle journalists involved in the growth and popularity of college football, the Southeastern Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nAmong Russell's trademarks was his emphasis on the lighter, humorous side of sports as well as his penchant for playing practical jokes. His three sports humor books, \"I'll Go Quietly\" (1944), \"I'll Try Anything Twice\" (1945) and \"Funny Thing About Sports\" (1948) were collections of humorous quotes, jokes, anecdotes and stories from the world of sports. The first two were published specifically for American troops in World War II, before television and radio were able to entertain troops abroad.\n\nRussell was instrumental in the formation and history of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, honoring those who have excelled in contribution to sports in Tennessee. In 2003, the Hall began the Fred Russell Distinguished American Award, given annually to a Tennessean who has exhibited excellence in their contribution to sports.\n\nRussell's memorabilia, including his personal items, photographs, awards, honors, are in several locations in Nashville. These locations include The Nashville Downtown Public Library \"Nashville Banner\" History Room and Exhibit; the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame; and The Brentwood Academy exhibit room in Brentwood, Tennessee.\n\nIn 1998, the \"Banner\" folded and it was assumed that the 92-year-old Russell would retire. Instead he was hired to write a weekly column for \"The Tennessean\". He completed his 70th year as a journalist in 1999, then retired. Russell penned his last sports column for the multi-author book \"Nashville: An American Self-Portrait\" in 2001. His byline thus appeared in nine different decades.\n\nAn influential figure in the Golden Age of sports, Russell was sports editor of the \"Nashville Banner\" for 68 years, from 1930–1998. In an era when newspapers were the primary form of information to the public, well before television was popular, Freddie Russell was a local legend in Middle Tennessee and was well known in the sports world throughout the nation.\n\nRussell was widely regarded throughout the South as one of the foremost authorities on the world of sports. He was the primary Nashville and Middle Tennessee sports man for most of the 50-plus years he was the Sports Editor at the Banner, having close friendships with the notable Nashville sports leaders of the era, such as Ed Temple, Larry Schmittou, future SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer and many others. He has influenced many young people through the TRA Rice-Russell Scholarship. Many well-known writers today were Rice-Russell scholars, including Roy Blount, Skip Bayless and others. Many other sportswriters such as Doug Segrest (\"Birmingham News\") and Lee Jenkins count Russell as a mentor and friend. Segrest began his career at the Banner. As the Chairman of the Honors Court of the College Football Hall of Fame for 29 years, Russell was the primary decision-maker regarding those who were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Many of those inducted credit Russell with their award and were grateful for his support and friendship.\n\nRussell was a mentor of ESPN's Buster Olney, who attended Vanderbilt and began his career as a reporter for the \"Banner\" before his ascension to the top of the sports reporting world. He impacted countless Vanderbilt student-athletes through the years. Whether he was writing about them, promoting their careers and endeavors, befriending them as they entered the professional world, and/or welcoming them back to Vanderbilt through the years, Russell was the mainstay of the Vanderbilt community. One example is Art Demmas, legendary NFL umpire for 29 years. Demmas today is the Southern Region Chairman of the National Football Foundation. Demmas and Russell worked together for 42 years as the primary founders and leaders of the Middle Tennessee Chapter of the NFF, which today is one of the biggest Chapters of the NFF. Demmas was a star football player for Vanderbilt in the 1950s. Early in his career, Demmas was a high school referee and got to know Russell. Later, Russell helped Demmas get a position as a college football referee. After working for several years at the college level, Demmas was recruited into the NFL as an umpire and later became an official.\n\nAnother example is Nashville radio personality George Plaster. Plaster counts Russell a great influence and a major reason for his success. Russell helped Plaster get his initial broadcasting position at Vanderbilt. Plaster went on to be the Broadcaster for Vanderbilt athletics. He moved into the sports talk show industry in Nashville, and today he is host of the top-rated and most popular sports talk show in Tennessee, The Zone on 104.5 FM.\n\nRussell was one of the primary journalists who covered the Tennessee State University Tigerbelles track team in their amazing success in the 1960 Olympics in Rome. Russell and TSU coach Ed Temple remained friends throughout their lives. Wilma Rudolph, who is originally from the town of Clarksville near Nashville, was one of the heroes of the 1960 Olympics.\n\nGrantland Rice has long been considered the dean of American sportswriters. Rice and Russell were longtime colleagues and shared many similarities. They were both Tennesseans and graduates of Vanderbilt University, and the two had similar styles as writers and people. Rice was originally from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and he worked as a sportswriter in Nashville before joining the \"New York Herald\" (later \"Herald Tribune\") from 1911–1930.\n\nIn football, Russell was a contemporary and friend of Gen. Bob Neyland, Coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant, Red Sanders and many others. Russell actually helped Bryant get one of his first assistant coaching jobs at Vanderbilt. The two remained lifelong friends. Red Sanders was the Head Football Coach at Vanderbilt before going to UCLA, and both were also lifelong friends.\n\nAs a longtime baseball writer, especially in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Russell often spent as long as a month covering spring training each year. He and fellow sportswriters such as Red Smith and Bill Corum would often travel together and stay with players in Florida (at hotels like the Soreno Hotel in St. Petersburg). Russell became a friend of many of the notable baseball stars of that era, as he covered legendary teams like the Yankees, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Even into the later years of his career, he was highly regarded by the legends of baseball, from Tommy Lasorda to Bowie Kuhn to Joe DiMaggio.\n\nRussel covered the inaugural and then over 40 Masters golf tournaments in Augusta, Georgia, all the while remaining a friend of Bobby Jones and the other golf pioneers of the day. He covered major championship boxing and was a friend and contemporary of Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey.\n\nAt the 25th Anniversary of Russell's career at the \"Nashville Banner\", many paid tribute to Russell. The 1955 celebration included stars such as football greats Red Grange and Bear Bryant, Bobby Jones and Jack Dempsey, as well as writer Red Smith from New York, all attending to honor their friend Freddie Russell.\n\nIn 1954, the \"Grantland Rice Scholarship\" at Vanderbilt was begun in honor of Rice. Endowed by the Thoroughbred Racing Association (TRA), the scholarship is awarded annually to an incoming first-year student with an interest in sportswriting. Russell was from the beginning involved in the administration and selection process of the scholarship. Later, in 1984, the TRA and its president, Charles J. Cella, endowed the scholarship in honor of Russell, making it the \"Fred Russell-Grantland Rice Sportswriting Scholarship\". The scholarship is an annual award of $10,000 toward tuition at Vanderbilt.\n\nRussell was elected to the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1988 and into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1974. At the time, he was only living sportswriter to receive the honor. He became a Charter Member of the Tennessee Sportswriters Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nRussell received the Distinguished American Award in 1980 given by the National Football Foundation (NFF). The award is given for excellence in exhibiting superior qualities of scholarship, citizenship and leadership. Two of the previous winners of the award were Vince Lombardi and Bob Hope.\n\nHe was the Honor's Court Chairman of the College Football Foundation and Hall of Fame for 29 years. Russell is a past President of the Football Writers of America. He was also a member of the Heisman Trophy Committee for 46 years and was the \"Southern\" chairman of the Heisman Trophy Committee for 30 years.\n\nRussell received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 1981 from the American Football Coaches Association, that same year he was awarded the Bert McGrane Award from the Football Writers of America. In 1983, The National Turf Writers Association (horse-racing) awarded Russell the Walter Haight Award for Excellence in Turf Writing, he received the Red Smith Award for his contributions to journalism in 1984.\n\nIn 1957, Russell received the inaugural Grantland Rice Memorial Award. Russell was named to the Vanderbilt Athletics Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.

{"id": "2209812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209812", "title": "Supersedeas bond", "text": "Supersedeas bond\n\nA supersedeas bond (often shortened to \"supersedeas\"), also known as a defendant's appeal bond, is a type of surety bond that a court requires from an appellant who wants to delay payment of a judgment until an appeal is over.\n\nThis is a feature of common law, and in particular the American legal system. In most European countries an appeal leads to an automatic stay of execution, unless the judge expressly ordered immediate execution.\n\nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary a supersedeas bond (also known as an \"appeal bond\") is:\n\nAfter litigation and a civil court ruling, the losing party can appeal against the judgment. At this point, both the plaintiff and defendant could have similar concerns. An appeal takes time – in some cases many years. After the case is finally decided, whichever party wins will perhaps be more \"out of pocket\" from its costs. Also time will have passed, and the losing party may be bankrupt or have used the time to hide assets or otherwise frustrate efforts to collect on the judgment if they lose their appeal.\n\nTherefore, it is often either a requirement of the law, or an order of the court, that prior to commencing its appeal processes, the losing party must provide a surety bond – money it pays to the court or a third party, to demonstrate its good faith and commitment to paying judgment if it loses, and in some cases to show that their appeal is not frivolous or merely a tactic to delay or avoid payment. This is known as a supersedeas (or \"appeal\") bond, and shows that they can and will cover the damages or fees awarded – including any additional costs of the appeal.\n\nThe bond may not be – and often is not – the exact value of the ruling. In some cases it is significantly larger since it is intended to cover interest or other costs which may arise on appeal.\n\nA supersedeas bond is often paid in full – and may be handled via insurance or underwriting in some cases.\n\nThe amount and availability of a supersedeas bond depends on state regulations and case specifics.\n\nIn New Jersey, the posting of a bond is not required to appeal a decision. However, if the party wishes to stay a judgment during the appeal, a motion must be made with the Superior Court, and the court can require the posting of a bond or cash deposit under R.2:9-5 and R.2:9-6. The same rule applies in Delaware under the state constitution as well as the court rules.\n\nArizona Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure, Rule 7, provides that \"except in cases involving custody of children,\" an appellant may obtain a stay on a lower court judgment and all other further proceedings by filing a supersedeas bond in the Superior Court.\n\nIn California, for instance, the supersedeas bond amount must be 150% of the judgment amount, whereas in Florida, the amount may include two years of statutory interest for those fees.\n\nIn Florida, the amount of a supersedeas bond is limited to no more than $50 million per appellant. State supreme court justice Carlson seems to be concerned with how the state has failed to differentiate between supersedeas and cost bonds. Which he stated \"is problematic, because these terms are not synonymous. The bond required to perfect an appeal is a cost bond, which is sometimes referred to as an appeal bond. The bond required to obtain a stay of execution of a judgment while the judgment is being appealed is a supersedeas bond, also referred to as an appeal bond.\"\n\nIn Texas, the amount of a supersedeas bond (referred to as \"security for judgments pending appeal\" in the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code) is determined as follows:\n\nObtaining a supersedeas bond may appear to be judicial red tape; however, it serves the best interest of the defendant and plaintiff. The appellant uses a supersedeas bond to stay the execution of the judgment, meaning the appellant does not have to pay the full amount of the judgment until the appellate court makes a ruling and then only if the ruling is to affirm the judgment. A surety bond also replaces the need for collateral. The plaintiff, or party to whom the money judgment is awarded, is fully protected by the bond and ensured payment, that is if the appealing party can afford the bond.\n\n"}
{"id": "2209822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209822", "title": "Die Frau ohne Schatten", "text": "Die Frau ohne Schatten\n\nWork on the opera began in 1911. Hofmannsthal’s earliest sketches for the libretto are based on a piece by Goethe, \"The Conversation of German Emigrants\" (1795). Hofmannsthal handles Goethe's material freely, adding the idea of two couples, the emperor and empress who come from another realm, and the dyer and his wife who belong to the ordinary world. Hofmannsthal also drew on portions of \"The Arabian Nights\", \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\", and even quotes Goethe's \"Faust\". The opera is conceived as a fairy tale on the theme of love blessed through the birth of children. Hofmannsthal, in his letters, compared it with Mozart's \"Magic Flute\", which has a similar arrangement of two couples.\n\nStrauss began composing immediately. He and Hofmannsthal worked on music and words in parallel, each receiving inspiration from the other. Strauss was happy with Hofmannsthal’s text, but asked him to rewrite many passages for the sake of dramatic effect. Hofmannsthal was adamantly opposed and was more worried about the symbolism beneath his libretto. The opera was finished in 1915, during the First World War, but had to wait for its premiere until 1919. The sometimes difficult genesis of the opera is documented in their correspondence.\nStrauss himself called this opera his “child of woe”, he even called it \"\"Die Frosch\"\" (\"Frosch\" means \"frog\" in German), that is \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\"). The complexity of the text and the stress of wartime made its composition a laborious task, and Strauss was also disappointed with the first productions.\n\nMusically, \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" is one of Strauss’s most complicated and colorful scores. In contrast to the quickly-moving \"Salome\" and \"Elektra\", it includes extended monologues and scenes. The opera remains a challenge to stage, even for a major opera house, calling as it does for five top soloists in the demanding principal roles, first rate secondary roles, a large orchestra, and elaborate sets and scenic effects.\n\nScenically, it is also demanding, with all the scene changes and special effects. Children singing out of a frying pan is particularly demanding, as is the final golden waterfall scene. Few opera houses are capable of staging the work.\n\nIn 1946 Strauss created a one-movement orchestral piece, the \"Fantasy on Die Frau ohne Schatten\", based on highlights from the opera. It was premiered in Vienna in 1947.\n\nWriting about \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" in 1948, Strauss said, despite the difficulties of staging it, \"it has succeeded nevertheless and has made a deep impression ... and music lovers in particular consider it to be my most important work.\"\n\nThe role of the Empress calls for a dramatic soprano who can support a very high tessitura and negotiate an act 1 entrance aria including coloratura passages, a trill, and a high D. Similarly, any tenor attempting the Emperor must be able to handle numerous passages in his uppermost range, particularly his extended solo scene in act 2. The Nurse's role makes some demands on the singer's lower range but also requires frequent leaps above the staff. The Dyer's Wife also calls for a soprano with immense sound to be heard over heavily orchestrated passages. The Dyer is the most approachable of the leading vocal parts, but again the orchestration is very heavy and requires a baritone with sufficient stamina to last the opera's three hours and fifteen minutes.\n\nThe opera's story is set in the mythical empire of the Southeastern Islands and involves five principal characters: the Emperor (tenor), the Empress (soprano), her Nurse (mezzo-soprano), Barak, a lowly dyer (bass-baritone), and the Dyer's Wife (dramatic soprano). A sixth character, Keikobad, King of the Spirit Realm and father to the Empress, sets the plot in motion, but never appears on stage. The Empress is half human: she was captured by the Emperor in the form of a gazelle. She assumed human shape and he married her, but she has no shadow. This symbolizes her inability to bear children. Keikobad has decreed that unless the Empress gains a shadow before the end of the twelfth moon, she will be reclaimed by her father and the Emperor will turn to stone.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\nIt is dawn, outside the bedchambers of the Emperor and Empress. The Messenger of Keikobad arrives, and tells the Empress's nurse that the Empress must acquire a shadow within three days, or will be forcibly returned to his realm, and the Emperor turned to stone. The Nurse is excited about the prospect of returning to the spirit world, since she hates humans and having to dwell with them.\n\nThe Messenger leaves and the Emperor emerges from his bedchamber. He departs on a three-day hunting trip, seeking his favorite falcon, which he drove away for attacking a gazelle that later turned into the Empress. He leaves his wife to the Nurse's care. The Empress emerges from her chamber and reminisces about times when she had the ability to turn into any creature she wanted.\n\nIt is revealed that after being attacked by the red falcon that the Emperor is seeking, she lost a talisman that gave transformation powers, and on which was inscribed a curse that foresaw the fate she and the Emperor are about to face if she does not acquire a shadow. The red falcon appears and warns the Empress that the curse is about to be fulfilled. The Empress begs the Nurse to help her get a shadow. The Nurse, who is steeped in magic, suggests descending to the mortal world and finding a woman who will sell her shadow to the Empress.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nBarak, a dyer, shares his hut with his Wife and his three brothers: the One-Eyed Man, the One-Armed Man, and the Hunchback. The three brothers fight about a stolen item and are separated by the Wife, who throws a bucket of water at them. The brothers-in-law then argue with the Wife. Barak enters and stops the argument. The Wife wants to have her in-laws thrown out, but her husband refuses.\n\nThe Dyer desires children, but his Wife fears the responsibility and has secretly sworn not to have any. The Dyer and his brothers leave, and the Empress and the Nurse arrive in disguise. The Wife wants them out of her house but the Nurse conjures up visions of luxury and promises them to the Wife in return for her shadow. The Wife agrees to deny her husband for three days during which the Nurse and the Empress will live at the Dyer's hut as poor relatives who have come to work as servants.\n\nBarak approaches and the Wife is worried that dinner is not ready, the Nurse once more uses her magic to have everything ready, including the splitting of Barak's bed in two. The Nurse and Empress disappear, and the Wife is greatly upset by the offstage Voices of Unborn Children lamenting, which emerge from the fish that are cooking on the fire. The Dyer returns to find he is barred from his marital bed. The Wife curtly informs him of the impending stay of her \"cousins\" and goes off to her separate bed. From outside the Town Watchmen are heard singing of the importance of conjugal love. Barak sighs and lies down to sleep on the floor.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe Empress, acting as a servant, helps the Dyer leave for work, but is troubled by her role, because Barak is very kind to her. The Nurse conjures up the image of a handsome youth by bringing a broom to life, which tempts the Dyer's Wife. The Dyer returns with his hungry brothers and beggar children. He has had a magnificent day at the market, selling all his goods, and has invited everyone to celebrate. However, his Wife manages to ruin the celebration.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nThe Emperor is led to his hunting lodge in the forest by the red falcon. He sees the Empress and Nurse surreptitiously enter the lodge, and is suspicious. When he comes closer, he smells a human odor trailing the Empress. Thinking she has betrayed him, he resolves to kill her. He first thinks of using an arrow, and then his sword, and then his bare hands. Finally he realizes he can't do it. He resolves to seek out some isolated ravine to be alone with his misery.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nAt the Dyer's house, the Dyer is drugged into sleep by the Nurse. The Nurse again conjures up the young man for the Wife, who grows frightened and rouses the Dyer. Barak is surprised to learn that there is a man in his house but then is quickly turned upon by his Wife, who shouts at him, then leaves for the city, leaving her confused husband. Left alone with Barak, the Empress feels more guilty than before.\n\n\"Scene 4\"\n\nThe Empress goes to sleep at the hunting lodge, but in her sleep she is further troubled by her crime and by the possible fate of the Emperor. In a dream, she sees the Emperor enter her father's realm. Unseen choruses chant the curse of the talisman. Awakening, she is overcome with guilt and remorse.\n\n\"Scene 5\"\n\nThe next day, the Wife announces that she has sold her shadow. When a fire reveals that she has no shadow, the enraged Barak is ready to kill her. The Empress cries out that she no longer wants the shadow. A sword appears in the Dyer's hand. His brothers restrain him as the Wife declares her remorse and urges Barak to kill her. An earthquake splits the ground and Barak and his wife are swallowed into the earth. The brothers flee, and the Nurse, recognizing Keikobad's hand, spirits the Empress away.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nIn a grotto beneath the realm of Keikobad, the wife and the Dyer are seen in separate chambers, unaware of the other's presence. The Wife is haunted by the Voices of Unborn Children. She protests that she loves the Dyer, who regrets his attempted violence. A voice directs them up separate staircases.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nThe Empress and Nurse arrive before Keikobad's Temple. The Nurse tries to convince the Empress to escape but she remembers the doors from her dream and knows that her father is waiting for her on the other side. She dismisses the Nurse and enters. The Nurse foretells terrible tortures awaiting the Empress and misleads the Wife and Barak, who are looking for each other, she to die at her husband's hand, he to forgive her and hold her in his arms. Keikobad's Messenger condemns the Nurse to wander the mortal world.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nInside the Temple, the Empress speaks to Keikobad, asking for forgiveness and to find her place amongst those who cast shadows. Keikobad does not answer but shows the Emperor already almost petrified. The Fountain of Life springs up before the Empress, and a temple guardian urges her to drink from it and claim the Wife's shadow for herself. But the Dyer and the Wife are heard offstage, and the Empress refuses to steal their future happiness and become human by robbing humanity from someone else: \"Ich will nicht!\" (\"I will not!\"). This act of renunciation frees her: she receives a shadow, and the Emperor is restored to natural form\n\n\"Scene 4\"\n\nThe scene changes to a beautiful landscape. Barak and his Wife are reunited and she regains her own shadow. Both couples sing of their humanity and praise their Unborn Children.\n\nThe opulent 164 piece instrumentation includes:\n\n\nFor the name of the opera, see \"The Woman Who Had No Shadow\".\n\nHofmannsthal was inspired by the fairy tale by Wilhelm Hauff, \"The Cold Heart\" (German: \"\").\n\nKeikobad is a variant spelling of the name of a sultan in the Mamluk Dynasty that ruled Delhi in the 13th century.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Silver Needle or Bai Hao Yin Zhen or usually just Yin Zhen is the Chinese type of white tea. Amongst white teas, this is the most expensive variety and the most prized, as only top buds (leaf shoots) of the camellia sinensis plant are used to produce the tea. Genuine Silver Needles are made from cultivars of the \"Da Bai\" (Large White) tea tree family. There are other productions that look similar with downy leaf shoots but most are green teas, and as green teas, they taste differently and have a different biochemical potency than the genuine white tea Silver Needle. It is commonly included among China's famous teas.\n\nIn the early years of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (AD 1796), Baihao Yinzhen was successfully cultivated from vegetable tea in Fuding. The export of Baihao Yinzhen started in 1891. Baihao Yinzhen was used to be called Luxueya, which is regarded as the ancestor of white tea. The mother tree is planted in Hongxue Cave on Taimu Mountain in Fuding.\n\nFuding, located in the northeast of Fujian Province, has mild and warm climate and plenty of rainfall. Perennial mean temperature is 18.4℃. It is surrounded by hills on 3 sides and the East China Sea on 1 side. The position is 26°52′～27°26′ north, 119°55′～120°43′ east. \n\nA genuine Silver Needle is a white tea. As such, it is only lightly oxidized. The most sought after productions are from the first flushes, which generally take place between late March to early April, when the year's first new buds \"flush\". For the production of Silver Needle, only the leaf shoots, i.e. the leaf buds before opening, are plucked. Unlike the plucking of green tea, the ideal time and weather for plucking white tea is a sunny morning when the sun is high enough to have dried any remaining moisture on the buds.\n\nTraditionally, the plucks are laid in shallow baskets to wilt under the sun for an extended period, and the best quality produced today are still made this way. To avoid loss due to sudden rain, gusts, or other accidents, some producers are taking the plucks indoor to wilt in a chamber with artificial warm air flow. The softened shoots are then piled for the required enzyme oxidation (often incorrectly referred to as fermentation) before they are taken for a low temperature bake-dry.\n\nTwo regions, Zhenghe and Fuding, spanning the north to north-eastern parts of the Fujian province are the major and original producers of this tea, although neighboring counties have also been producing. The two major cultivars employed by these regions are Fuding Da Bai and Zhenghe Da Bai, named after their origins. These differences are important to distinguish the two major styles of Silver Needles — the Zhenghe style and the Fuding style. The former is usually a lot darker, with significantly longer piled-up time for oxidation, yielding a tea with fuller body than the latter style, which is generally lighter with shorter oxidation. The character of the tea tree leaves of the former allows for the extended piled-up time without turning bad. Both styles have their own group of followers, as taste is a rather personal preference.\n\nBaohao Yinzhen can be harvested in spring, summer and autumn. Spring tea has the highest quality and most abundant which makes up half of annual production. \n\nBaihao Yinzhen is the tender bud of the white tea. It need to be picked up before the buds open. Tea planters pick the leaves straightly from the tea bush and put them into the baskets in dry sunny days. \n\nThe withering of white tea leaves is a natural process which need the tea workers to use their real skills. The freshly picked leaves and buds are left in a dormant state for a maximum of 3 days to have them dried up thoroughly. \n\nDrying the Baihao Yinzhen is an essential and challenging step. The process has a strict requirement of temperature and workers’ skills. If the temperature falls to be in a specific range, the taste of Baihao Yinzhen will lose its unique taste.\n\nAs with all white teas, it is best prepared with water below boiling (at around 75 to 80 degrees Celsius or 167 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit) and produces a slightly viscous glittering pale yellow color with evidence of floating white hairs that reflect light. Baihao Yinzhen is said to smell of \"fresh-cut hay\", and the flavour is described as sweet, vegetal, and delicate. Steeping should be longer than other white teas; up to 5 minutes per brew, and the volume of tea to be used can be higher. There are few parallels to be drawn as the taste is not similar to any other teas but Bai Mu Dan, except the latter is fuller but not as sweet and delicate.\n\nBaihao Yinzhen needs to be stored with a lower amount of moisture. If the bud turns into powder after squeezing it, it means the amount of humidity is low enough. If not, the tea needs to be brewed as soon as possible. Tinfoil cylinders, porcelains, tinted glass bottles are the best containers for Baihao Yinzhen. Cans, wooden boxes and bamboo boxes are also acceptable. Baihao Yinzhen should be stored in dry and clean containers and a ventilated area. Also, the tea cannot be stored things with strong smells like camphor, medicines, cosmetics, and detergents.\n\n\n"}

The amplifier was launched in the market in 1979 when the Roland company was trying to pursue the success of the Mesa Boogie Mark amplifiers. \n\nProperly speaking these are hybrid amplifiers, the pre-amp being built with solid-state circuitry. The built-in solid-state distortion channel gives a somewhat harsh sound, and is best bypassed.\n\nAside from the overdrive circuit, the amp contains a spring reverb, and provision for external effects loops and switches.\n\nThe Bolt was produced until 1984: Roland made a decision at that time to focus production on solid state amplifiers such as their very successful Jazz Chorus. In recent years the interest in this range of amplifiers has increased, owing to their good tone, and affordability in comparison with other classic amplifiers.\n\nBoth combo (amp/speaker) and 'head' versions of these amplifiers were produced. The combo amplifiers are often found (as in the illustrated example) with replacement speaker drivers, the original having failed under stress, as the Roland unit was only just beyond the constraints of the amplifier output.\n\n"}

The hosts were Sal Masekela, Ewa Mataya Laurance, and Adrianne Curry. GSN cancelled the show in 2006.\n\nThe show featured four people who first auditioned for the show in both categories of personality and pool skill. The four contestants then played games of nine ball against one another for bets. At the beginning of the show, each contestant was given $5,000 for use in betting.\n\nDuring warm-ups, a player was selected for control of the table. He decided whom to play against for the first game. The minimum bet in the first round was $1,000 per game. The first round continued until all players had played at least once, at which point the two players with the least money were pitted against one another in an elimination round.\n\nAny player with money was allowed to place a side bet on the current game (even one of the competing players). Anything could be bet on; for example, which contestant would win, whether a particular ball would be made or missed, or whether one player would \"run out the table.\" All side bets were in $500 increments, but the bettor was required to find a taker for a bet to be official.\n\nThe two players with the smallest bankrolls at the end of a round were forced to play one game to survive. Whoever had the smaller bankroll was of necessity all-in, and the opponent put in an equal amount. The winner of the game survived to move on to the next round, and collected winnings as usual. If the \"all-in\" player moved on, that meant leftover money was in contention. The winner of the \"Table Control\" game collected all of this contended money.\n\nIn round two, minimum bets were $2,000, and the challenged player could not back down. The challenged player could either accept the stakes or raise. Side bets were still bottomed at $500, and the winner of the first game played against the other player in the round. In addition, failing to make a ball on the break gave the opponent ball-in-hand. After two games, the two low scorers played in the Elimination game as in round one.\n\nIn the final round, the two remaining players played for all of the money. In this round, missing any shot gave the opponent ball-in-hand. The first three games were 'all-in' affairs; if the player with more money could win any of them, the show was over and the $20,000 won. If the round went three games with no player having all $20,000, the fourth game was played for all of the cash, regardless of each player's bankroll at that time.\n\nFor celebrity shows the rules were altered, in round 1, each player automatically risked $1,000 and no higher during games, side bets were limited to $500. In round 2, players risked $2,000 for each game. In the final round consisted of three sudden death games, with the player in 4th facing 3rd, the winner playing the person in 2nd, the winner of that playing against the player in first, the winner received $20,000 for their charity, the others received $10,000 for their charities, all four celebrities also received a Brunswick pool table for themselves.\n\nTwo celebrity shows were broadcast.\n\n"}

He won the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition and the 2009 Seattle International Comedy Competition.\n\nOriginally from Austin, Texas, Kent resided in Los Angeles during his development as a comic, moving back to his hometown in 2011 with his partner, Rachel Dory, and their two daughters. He is also known for his stand-up comedy appearances on Showtime and Nickelodeon, and as a series regular on the NBC show \"Last Comic Standing\" (seasons 1 & 3). His comedy has been critically acclaimed by \"Rolling Stone\" and XM Radio, who called his debut CD \"An instant classic\". \n\nKent attended Hyde Park Baptist Private School in Austin, where he lettered in Varsity Basketball and Cross Country. He was almost molested several times but graduated in 1992. After high school, Kent attended the University of Texas at Austin but dropped out in 1994 to move to Los Angeles and pursue stand-up comedy.\n\nIn 2003 Kent landed his first staff writing job on \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\". While writing for \"Best Damn\", he was diagnosed with stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma. He began undergoing chemotherapy one day a week while continuing to work. After three months of chemotherapy and 35 days of radiation therapy Kent was pronounced in remission. Shortly after finishing treatment, he auditioned and was subsequently chosen as a series regular for \"Last Comic Standing\" Season One.\n\nAlmost immediately after \"Last Comic Standing\" wrapped, Kent received news that his cancer had recurred. Facing a grim prognosis, he opted to undergo an intensive chemotherapeutic procedure known as an autologous bone marrow transplant which involved radically high doses of chemotherapy and long stays in the hospital. During one stay at City of Hope National Medical Center Kent developed an infection in his chest port and lost over 90 pounds. His doctors told him he had a 50% chance to live a year if he survived treatment, and he was released from the hospital in October 2003, returning to stand-up soon after. \n\nKent was the first person voted off on Season 1 of \"Last Comic Standing\". Kent competed on season 3 as well, advancing through 6 of 8 total episodes. In 2005, two years after his treatment, Kent was asked to give the keynote address at the 29th Annual City of Hope Bone Marrow Transplant Reunion. Since then he has regularly spoken and performed at cancer fundraisers, and in 2011 shared a bill with Will Ferrell at the Cancer for College Fundraiser. \n\nIn 2009 Kent won the 30th annual Seattle International Comedy Competition and appeared on Showtime's \"Green Collar Comedy Slam\".

{"id": "2209918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209918", "title": "Ivalice", "text": "Ivalice\n\nThough described often as a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\nIvalice was co-created by Yasumi Matsuno and Hiroyuki Ito as a fictional world with its own identity; a medieval-like world where magic and machine exist together. The usual elements of \"Final Fantasy\", such as Chocobos, crystals and magic spells, blend into the setting. This setting first appeared in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", a game developed by key staff members behind both \"\" (directed by Yasumi Matsuno) and \"Final Fantasy VI\" (directed by Hiroyuki Ito). It was also Matsuno's first project with Square following his departure from Quest in 1995. Matsuno's next game, \"Vagrant Story\", featured several allusions to \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", and Matsuno stated in 2004 that \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", and \"Final Fantasy XII\" unfold quite close on the map of Ivalice, \"a complex world with a very long history and the stories\".\n\nFollowing Matsuno's departure from Square Enix during development on \"Final Fantasy XII\", Square Enix has continued to feature Ivalice in other games.\n\nIn 2011, Matsuno stated that he never originally intended for \"Vagrant Story\" to take place in Ivalice. As a result, any references he had made of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" in \"Vagrant Story\", as well as \"Vagrant Story\" references in \"Final Fantasy XII\", only serve as \"fan service\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics\" (1997), a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Sony PlayStation video game console, marked the first appearance of Ivalice. The game combined thematic elements of the \"Final Fantasy\" video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" is set in a fictional medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice and created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.\n\nIn an interview with Akito Inoue, an assistant professor at the International University of Japan, Inoue mentions that \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" was made because of how casual gamers are usually put off by games with branching storylines found in Matsuno's other titles such as \"Tactics Ogre\".\n\n\"Vagrant Story\" (2000) is an action role-playing game featuring no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.\n\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. The game shares several traits with \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", although it is not a direct sequel. The game's story centers on four children; Marche, Mewt, Ritz, and Doned, who live in a small town named St. Ivalice. The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town, \"Ivalice\", after discovering an ancient magical book. The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him.\n\nDevelopment on the game began when Square announced its publishing agreement with Nintendo, and it was later confirmed by the producer Matsuno. The development team of \"Tactics Advance\", Square's Product Development Division 4, was constructed from employees of Quest Corporation, and work began in February 2002. This comes after Quest announced the handover of its software development team to Square, of which the former is famed for its series.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XII\" (2006) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 platform. It is the twelfth title in the mainline \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game introduced several innovations to the offline titles in the mainline series: an open world, a seamless battle system, a controllable camera, a customizable \"gambit\" system which lets the player automatically control the actions of characters; and a \"license\" system which determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters.\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional land of Ivalice, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Dalmasca is annexed by Archadia, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of becoming a sky pirate in command of an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.\n\nOn December 13, 2006, a Square Enix representative informed Tokyo reporters that the already announced \"\" would be joined by other games in a new subseries known as the \"Ivalice Alliance\". \"\" is a PlayStation Portable and iOS port of the original \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" game. \"\" is a Nintendo DS sequel to \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", albeit set in the actual Ivalice world and not an artificial illusory world, unlike its predecessor. Another title in the collection, \"Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System\", was revealed on May 8, 2007.\n\nExecutive producer Akitoshi Kawazu explained that the aim of the \"Ivalice Alliance\" is to \"spread the word about the world of Ivalice\", and to bring more players into the franchise, with new titles not restricted to the standard role-playing game genre but also tactical games and games similar to \"Vagrant Story\". \"Revenant Wings\" director Motomu Toriyama noted that with the large and original team that worked on \"Final Fantasy XII\", Ivalice became more Square Enix's world than that of the former Quest team, and that the \"Ivalice Alliance\" world is thus slightly more influenced by \"Final Fantasy XII\" than the earlier Ivalice titles.\n\n\"Crystal Defenders\" is a series of turn-based strategy video games developed by MSF/Winds and published by Square Enix. It comprises several iterations released for mobile phones and through online video game delivery services. The games are set in the fictional world of Ivalice and features job classes, monsters and summoned creatures from the tactical role-playing game \"\".\n\n\"Fortress\" is the code name of a cancelled action role-playing video game that was in development by Grin. Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for \"Fortress\" and pre-production began in the second half of 2008. During development, Square Enix approached the developer and proposed making the game a spin-off of \"Final Fantasy XII\". Grin reconceived the game in the recurring \"Final Fantasy\" world of Ivalice, and included elements of \"Final Fantasy XII\" such as stylistic motifs and character designs; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the \"Final Fantasy\" series. It was to be released on the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms.\n\nDuring development, Square Enix did not pay Grin over several months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the \"Final Fantasy\" series, but after six months of development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, \"Fortress\" was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.\n\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics S\" is a tactical role-playing game with social features and multiplayer battles. It was released in Japan on the Mobage social gaming network in May 2013. The mobile game ended its service on July 31, 2014.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XIV\" (2013) contains numerous references and homages to Ivalice games, though the writers maintain that there is no direct connection between the two fictional worlds. On October 10, 2017, Square Enix released a patch for the \"\" expansion titled \"The Legend Returns\". This patch includes a raid called Return to Ivalice: the Royal City of Rabanastre, which was written and directed by Matsuno. This scenario adapts characters and plot elements of \"Final Fantasy XII\" and \"Tactics\" into an original story set in the world of \"Final Fantasy XIV\". Future patches continue this story while the \"Shadowbringers\" expansion has the Viera as a playable race.\n\nIn Japan, \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\"'s story was expanded and broadcast in Japanese radio stations. The radio drama entitled \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" Radio Edition was broadcast in four radio stations within Japan from early January 2003 to late March 2003.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XII\" was adapted into a manga by Gin Amou. Square Enix published the series in a total of five \"tankōbon\" volumes from December 22, 2006 to August 22, 2009.\n\nThe events of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" are set in the kingdom of Ivalice, which borders Ordalia in the east and the insular nation of Romanda in the north-west, from which it is separated by the Larner Channel. The kingdom forms a peninsula and is composed of seven provinces which were individual kingdoms before their unification: Gallione, Lionel, Lesalia, Fovoham, Limberry, Zeltennia and Mullonde.\n\nThe insular province of Mullonde is home to the Glabados Church and is ruled separately from the royal government. In the game's backstory, Mullonde's territory was once connected to the mainland, but was mostly submerged by a disaster involving the Zodiac Stones and which occurred soon after Saint Ajora's execution, with its city made into a Necrohol, a city of the dead. The city of Bervenia, Ajora's birthplace, is governed by the Church although it is enclosed in the province of Lesalia.\n\nPrior to the events of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", the Fara church dominated the kingdom of Ivalice. The remake of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", \"Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions\", refers to the Fara Church as Pharism. The life of Ajora saw Fara replaced with the new Glabados church which, by the time of the game, is the major religion of the kingdom. Glabados is monotheistic and intensely political, underscoring much of Ivalice history. Followers of Glabados use the word \"Faram\" to affirm their prayers. During the events of the game, the church is revealed to have put a large spin on history, particularly the events surrounding the life of Ajora, a messianic figure.\n\n\"Vagrant Story\" is set in the ruins of the city of Leá Monde. The kingdom of Valendia is also heavily mentioned, and a few of its locations are featured in the prologue and the ending sequence. In contrast to the other Ivalice games, magic is rare, being suppressed by religious doctrine. Other races are never mentioned.\n\n\"Vagrant Story\" centers around the \"Dark\", a formless, invisible entity. In places where the Dark runs strongest, those who died will have their corpses controlled by the dark, becoming the undead. The Dark exists within a person as negative energy that unleashes the individual's latent power. Throughout the story, many individuals crave the powers of the Dark, which centers around the abandoned city of Leá Monde. Another mythological aspect of \"Vagrant Story\" is the Kiltia, an ancient cult which built itself upon the Dark and ancient sorcery, and of which the Müllenkamp sect is stemmed from. It can be seen that most rituals and summoning performed in the game involved ancient Kildean magic.\n\nIn \"Vagrant Story\", the Iocus priesthood of the kingdom of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, although they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed over the course of the story, though it goes unresolved.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", the protagonist lives in a land called St. Ivalice. Following the characters' discovery of the book called the Gran Grimoire, St. Ivalice was transformed into a \"mirror\" of the \"real\" kingdom of Ivalice. The races seen in the world of \"Tactics Advance\"— Bangaa, Moogle, Viera and Nu Mou— also appear in the game \"Final Fantasy XII\", the setting of which has come to represent the \"real\" Ivalice. This is apparently explained as Mewt (one of the main characters in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance) replied that \"Final Fantasy\" was his favorite game. \"\" also takes place in both St. Ivalice and the Ivalice of \"Final Fantasy XII\".\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy XII\", Ivalice covers three continents, Ordalia, Valendia and Kerwon. The demography consists of the known races: Humes, Bangaa, Viera, Seeq and Moogles, and other minority races. Civilization is advanced in this world where the use of a magical stone called magicite is extensive in everyday life, airships are a prominent transportation and multi-story buildings cover the cityscape. Ivalice in \"Final Fantasy XII\" is designed based on a mixture of cultures. According to the game developers, these designs are inspired from a mixture of medieval Mediterranean countries, Turkish architecture, art-deco from Indian architecture, the cityscape of New York City and the Arabic culture found hidden in European countries. As such, many patterns are featured as geometrical and Arabesque in shape. The cityscape is also conceived by Matsuno as being dirty and weather-worn, mirroring the conditions of a medieval landscape. The natural landscape also mirrors Earth's geographical features, including large expanse of deserts and snowy mountains.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy XII\", the continents in Ivalice are presently home to three nations: Rozarria, Archadia and Dalmasca. There was once the Kingdom of Nabradia and the Republic of Landis in Valendia, now either destroyed or assimilated into the Archadian Empire. Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca's position as a neutral buffer region between the two countries is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia at the onset of the game. With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule, Dalmasca is set to play a central role in the still-heated dispute between its neighbors, which is escalating once more.\n\nThe events of \"Final Fantasy XII\" are focused on the area around the Galtean Peninsula, itself located in the larger Ivalice region. This area of Ivalice is diverse in both geography and climate, ranging from the hilly, clement grasslands of southern Valendia to the deserts of Dalmasca. In Kerwon, south of Dalmasca, the lands are arid at lower altitudes, though the higher elevations are the only places in the region known to receive snow. The north of Kerwon is heavily forested, home to the dense Golmore Jungle, within which lies the magical Feywood.\n\nThese various micro-climates are influenced by the magical phenomenon known as Mist, an unstable substance with the ability to cause great variation over small areas. Due to the influence of Mist, several areas of Ivalice are 'jagd', areas in which Mist-laden winds and magicite-rich soil interfere with airship mechanisms. As such, jagds tend to be harsh, lawless frontiers, uncontrolled by any nation. Physically, the peninsula area resembles Europe in the east, with the landmasses of Valendia, Ordalia and Kerwon surrounding a central body of water (the Naldoan Sea) on three sides. To the west, Valendia and Kerwon curve away from Ordalia, creating the Galtean Peninsula.\n\nMist is responsible for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.\n\nNethicite, another type of magicite, works by absorbing Mist, thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite can be described as either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During the course of the game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy XII\", the Light of Kiltia, a polytheistic religion, is the dominant church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula. Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether. At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis at the time of \"Final Fantasy XII\", until his death during the events of the story. Like Glabados followers in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Kiltias swear on the name of Faram, the Father of All, in the manner of the Christian amen. The \"Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω\" guide considers the Glabados Church a possible branch of Kiltia.\n\nSome of the locations in the Ivalice of \"Final Fantasy XII\" returned in its sequel, \"\", along with a new area called Lemurés. A legendary \"Purvama\" (Floating Continent) raised into the skies by the god Feolthanos long ago, this land is ruled by three \"Sacred Crystals\" called Auraliths, which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world. In \"Revenant Wings\", the \"Legend of the Floating Land\" has become an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island for Auracite, pieces of Auralith able to allow one to summon entities called Yarhi. The ruins of Lemurés are where the Aegyl reside. During the course of the game, the main characters learn that the sealing of Lemurés was the work of the Occuria, whom Feolthanos defied prior to using the Auralith to become a god-like being.\n\nIn the backstory of \"\", Feolthanos established a personality cult over Lemurés, labeling himself to his people as a god. Though Lemurés still had a sense of peace and paradise, in spite of Yarhi attacks, it was a false paradise due to the Aurcite draining the Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos' plan to destroy Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians.\n\nTaking place only a few years after \"Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings\", \"Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift\" introduces a new region of Ivalice called Jylland. The region of Jylland is made up of the western half of the Ordalia Continent and the eastern half of the Loar Continent, with Jagd Zellea to the north of the two continents. There are five regions spread out across these two continents, which consist of smaller territories inside of them, twenty being the number of territories throughout Jylland, which contain a varying number of areas (battlefields) in each of them (eighty-six areas in all of Jylland). The towns in Jylland include Camoa, Grazston, Moorabella, Fluorgis, and Goug. Goug in particular, is a town of Moogles. Another race similar to the Aegyl also was introduced along with this game. Called Gria, these winged females are small, but pack a mean punch, specializing in three new classes and one old one. Geomancer, Ravager, and Raptor, along with the before-human exclusive class Hunter were given to the Gria, and only the geomancer class uses magic.\n\nThe timeline of Ivalice as presented in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter. A few sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice. The official timeline, however, was eventually given in the \"Final Fantasy XII\" Ultimania Omega, and placed the events of \"Final Fantasy XII\" before those of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\".\n\nThere is no direct mention of Ivalice in \"Vagrant Story\". However, several references are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, the setting for \"Vagrant Story\", shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in \"Final Fantasy XII\". The Kiltia religion, featured in \"Final Fantasy XII\", was the religion of the ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\"), is used at the beginning of the game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place \"Vagrant Story\" latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". Matsuno has said that he never intended \"Vagrant Story\" to be in the same world as \"Tactics\" and \"Final Fantasy XII\", though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.\n\nSome confusion still persists, particularly due to the facts surrounding Saint Ajora, who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", yet in the Clan Primer of \"Final Fantasy XII\" is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation, already two thousand years old. This is the result of a mistranslation, as the Japanese text places Ajora's birth some decades after the events of Final Fantasy XII. While no gender is specified in the North American release of \"Final Fantasy XII\", in both the Japanese Clan Primer and the Ultimania timeline, Ajora is referred to as , while Ajora of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" is male.\n\n\"\" has been confirmed by the developers to take place after \"Final Fantasy XII\", and both \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" and \"A2\" to take place \"close\" in time to \"Final Fantasy XII\".\n\nThe populations seen in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" and \"Vagrant Story\" are essentially human. The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as Goblins or Ogres. Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where the human race is called Humes. Monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in \"Vagrant Story\", with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark. The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order.\n\nIvalice as featured in \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" is populated by four main intelligent races in addition to Humes; all of them also reappearing in \"Final Fantasy XII\".\n\n\n\n\n\"Final Fantasy XII\" introduces several other races to Ivalice, with varying importance in the plot of the game.\n\n\n\"\" introduces two other races:\n\n\nLastly, \"\" features two other races:\n\n\nWithin \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", legends revolve around the Zodiac Brave Story, which deals with twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones—magical stones engraved with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations—to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora as the leader of the Zodiac Braves.\n\nThe \"Lucavi\" are demons linked to the twelve Zodiac Stones who seek to gain control of Ivalice by resurrecting their defeated leader, the High Seraph, Ultima. Any person who holds a Zodiac Stone may make a contract with the Lucavian demon associated with it, and in doing so, become one with that demon. During the events of the game, the Lucavi manipulate the Glabados Church into controlling the War of the Lions to ensure enough bloodshed for Ultima's resurrection. A thirteenth Lucavi, associated with the sun constellation Ophiuchus, can also be found in a side-quest. Some of the Lucavi reappear as Totema in \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", while a sub-boss, Gukko, becomes a \"Rukavi\" before his final encounter with the party, with an appearance similar to that of a vampire-type enemy. They also reappear in \"Final Fantasy XII\" as summoned Espers—with backstories that describe how they became known as Lucavi. It is also revealed that they were creations of the Occuria from \"Final Fantasy XII\". In the new translation of the PSP version of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", the Zodiac Stones are also referred to as Auracite—the same stone used to summon the Yarhi and Scions (the Lucavi) in \"Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy XII\" also introduces the \"Occuria\", immortal beings who have no visible faces, only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell-like armor, surrounded by an aquamarine aura. The Occuria can become selectively invisible, and are also capable of possession, shape-shifting and image projection. Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the main religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a central role in the history of Ivalice, controlling all major events, such as the rise of the Dynast-King Raithwall. Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the four-hundred year rule after Raithwall, the Occurian Venat, apparently disgusted with its kind's manipulations, rebelled and gave the secret of Nethicite to the Archadia's Dr. Cid and Vayne to overthrow the Occuria and make mankind the masters of their own fate. The events of the game eventually provoke the end the \"Age of Stones\" (the Occuria's control over Ivalice). In \"Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings\", the Occuria were revealed to have played a part in the sealing of the Purvama Lemurés long ago, which by the present time became a land of legend that many Sky Pirates sought for its Auracite.\n\n\"Revenant Wings\" also introduced beings known as the \"Yarhi\". Also known as \"Espers\" to those on Ivalice, they are powerful entities created from anima, spiritual energy. Through certain elements, such as Auracite or Mist, the Yarhi can assume physical form until they are defeated in battle. They are summoned by the wielders of Auracite and obey their every command. Fourteen such Yarhi appeared in \"Final Fantasy XII\"; the first thirteen being the Lucavi from \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" which are referred as the \"Scions of darkness\", magical beings created by Occuria with great strength and intelligence. Led by Ultima, they eventually rebelled for various reasons and engaged themselves in a war dubbed the Thousand Year War against the gods; but they were eventually defeated. Consequently, the gods bound their existence with the Glyph of the Beast, trapping them within the Mist. Any who controls the Glyph in turn controls the Scion, allowing them to operate as summoned creatures. The Fourteenth is the legendary swordsman Gilgamesh, who collects the swords of those he defeats in battle. While most fight, few like Cu Sith and the Sahaguin Namingway offer aid in other ways. Also, the viera job \"Summoner\" can call and use the powers of mythological gods like Kirin, Shiva, and many others.\n\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics\" sold 824,671 copies in Japan in the first half of 1997. Since then, the total number of copies sold in Japan has reached approximately 1,350,000. In the United States it reached an estimated sale of 750,000 units as of year 2004. As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 2.27 million copies worldwide, with 1.36 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 910,000 abroad. \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" sold over 440,000 copies during its year of release in Japan, with nearly 225,000 units being sold in its first week alone. By August 6, 2004, more than 1 million units of the game were sold in North America and Europe together. \"The War of the Lions\" reached the top of Japanese gaming charts, and sold 100,000 copies in the first month of release in the United States. The game was the 53rd best-selling game of 2007 in Japan at 301,796 copies according to \"Famitsu\" magazine. The Ultimate Hits edition sold an additional 19,488 copies in Japan. Square Enix reports that as of May 31, 2009, \"Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift\" has sold 670,000 copies worldwide, with 310,000 copies sold in Japan, 240,000 copies in North America, and 120,000 copies in Europe.\n\nEditorials from the gaming website RPGamer.com outlined several similarities between the Catholic Church and the Church of Glabados portrayed in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". One editorial noted that it was a controversial move by the developers, as if the church institution \"in fact worships a demon, and is evil from its god on down\". However, another editorial mentions that such controversies failed to recognize the church in question is the medieval Roman Catholic Church, and that historically such institution is known for its flaws in the past.\n\nThe Ivalice of \"Final Fantasy XII\" is considered a Japanese take on the \"Star Wars\" galaxy by a GameSpot reviewer (in turn, \"Star Wars\" was considered an American take on Japanese \"jidaigeki\" samurai films, specifically Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\"). Even with the established fantasy setting, the airships and air battles gives the world a science-fiction feel. Adding to the \"galaxy far, far away\" mood is the mingling of different races within large cities and the political unrest between the rebellion and the Empire. Because the characters primarily traverse on foot, the world of \"Final Fantasy XII\" feels vast, and reviewers enjoyed sightseeing because of the impressive visuals.\n\nEurogamer praised the \"beautiful architecture and interaction of the various races\" in \"Final Fantasy XII\" and noted that there was a \"melancholy feeling\" to \"wandering the barren wastes\" of Ivalice. In their review of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", IGN called the battle areas \"extremely well designed and detailed to perfection\", singling out the churches as especially beautiful. GameSpot was similarly impressed with the wide varieties of \"beautiful\" terrains to be seen in Ivalice, from swamps to castles to \"anything else you can think of\". PSXExtreme praised the feel of Lea Monde in \"Vagrant Story\", calling it \"excellently lit\" in a style that brought out the \"dark and moody\" feeling of the game. They went on to say that the game's \"great visual presentation will go down in the books as one of the best looking [PlayStation] games\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2209922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209922", "title": "New York-style pizza", "text": "New York-style pizza\n\nNew York-style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.\n\nThis style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s, itself derived from the Neapolitan style pizza made in Italy. Today it is the dominant style eaten in the New York Metropolitan Area states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and variously popular throughout the United States. Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nThe first pizzeria in the United States of America was claimed to have been founded by Gennaro Lombardi in New York City's Little Italy in 1905, though this has recently been debunked by author Peter Regas. An immigrant \"pizzaiolo\" (pizza maker) from Naples, he opened a grocery store in 1897; eight years later, it was licensed to sell pizza by New York State. An employee, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza, which sold for five cents a pie. Many people, however, could not afford a whole pie and instead would offer what they could in return for a corresponding sized slice, which was wrapped in paper tied with string. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island, called Totonno's.\n\nThe original pizzerias in New York used coal-fired ovens and baked their pizza with the cheese on the bottom and sauce on top.\nBy 2010, over 400 pizza restaurants existed in New York City, with hundreds more of varied cuisine also offering the dish.\n\nNew York-style pizza is traditionally hand-tossed, consisting in its basic form of a light layer of tomato sauce sprinkled with dry, grated, full-fat mozzarella cheese; additional toppings are placed over the cheese. Pies are typically around 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) in diameter, and commonly cut into 8 slices. These large wide slices are often eaten as fast food while folded in half (like one would fold a cardboard box) from the crust, as their size and flexibility can make them unwieldy to eat flat. Folding the slice also collects the abundant oil in the crease, and allows the slice to be eaten with one hand.\n\nNew York-style pizza gets its distinguishing crust from the high-gluten bread flour with which it is made. Minerals present in New York City's tap water supply are also credited with giving the dough in metro area pies their characteristic texture and flavor. Some out-of-state pizza bakers even transport the water cross-country for the sake of authenticity. However, many pizza makers would dispute this fact, noting that high-quality and true-to-form New York-style pizza is being found in more and more places. The popularity of New York-style pizza is rapidly being exported from New York and globalization of food culture has made access to the right equipment and products easier for those in the industry seeking to produce a product authentic to its New York roots.\n\nIn contrast to a Chicago-style pizza, which is usually smaller in size, typically no more than 1 foot (12 inches, 30 cm) in diameter, the average size of a New York-style pizza is typically larger, ranging between 1 1/2 to 2 feet (18 to 24 inches, 45 to 60 cm) in diameter, with some even larger, giant New York-style pizzas measuring as large as 3 feet (36 inches, 90 cm) in diameter.\n\nTypical condiments include dried oregano, garlic powder, dried red chili pepper flakes, dried basil, and grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nNew York-style pizza is most prevalent in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, but can be found throughout the Northeastern region and beyond. Outside this area, many pizzas described as \"New York style\", including those of major pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, generally do not fall within the variations commonly accepted as genuine in its native area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2209930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209930", "title": "Woodward &amp; Lothrop", "text": "Woodward &amp; Lothrop\n\nWoodward & Lothrop was a department store chain headquartered in Washington, D.C. Woodward & Lothrop was the capital's first department store, opening in 1887. Woodies, as it was often nicknamed, maintained stores in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Its flagship store was a fixture of the shopping district in downtown Washington, with Garfinckel's, and in the late 1990s the center of controversy over competing visions for DC's urban renewal.\n\nSamuel Walter Woodward (1848 – August 2, 1917) and Alvin Mason Lothrop (1847–1912) opened a dry goods store in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1873, and maintained several stores in the Boston area. In partnership with Charles E. Cochrane, on February 8, 1880 they moved to Washington. For many years, their department store would sponsor a \"Founders Day Sale\" in early February to commemorate the move.\n\nWoodward, Lothrop & Cochrane opened at 705 Market Space at the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 7th Street Northwest (now the United States Navy Memorial). The first store was so successful that within a year, they moved to a larger location at 921 Pennsylvania Avenue. After flooding in 1886, they moved again to the corner of 11th and F Streets NW. Woodward and Lothrop purchased Cochrane's share of the partnership, and the new store was renamed Woodward & Lothrop.\n\nWoodies expanded into suburban shopping malls after World War II, but the owning families resisted expansion by amalgamation, and the chain grew slowly. It became a target of takeover attempts in the 1980s, resisting a leveraged buyout by Ronald Baron in February 1984 but accepting a $277 million bid later that year from Detroit shopping center mogul A. Alfred Taubman. \n\nBut Taubman had incurred substantial debt during his '80s acquisitions, which included the Philadelphia-based Wanamaker's department stores in 1986 as well as Sotheby's auction house and various properties. The early 1990s recession, while historically mild, disproportionately impacted real estate and department store retail. The greater Washington area was also affected by sharp reductions in defense spending after the end of the Cold War, leading to a loss of consumer confidence.\n\nWoodward & Lothrop, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 18, 1994, with $608 million in total assets and $659 million in total liabilities. Drastic cost-cutting and increased sales figures did not return the firm to profitability, however, and the chain, including its John Wanamaker subsidiary, was liquidated. On June 21, 1995, seven of the remaining Woodward & Lothrop locations were sold to J. C. Penney and the rest plus the Wanamaker's locations were sold to May Department Stores Company. By November 1995, all Woodies stores had completed liquidation sales and were permanently closed.\n\nSoon after moving into the historic Carlisle building in 1887, Woodward & Lothrop outgrew its space and began expanding, purchasing the neighboring properties. By 1897 it occupied almost the entire block surrounded by 10th, 11th, F, and G Streets NW. In 1898 and 1902, the buildings were renovated behind a new facade facing G Street designed by Henry Ives Cobb. Two additional floors were added in 1912 and 1913, and yet another building added in 1925.\n\nThe building attained its lasting form in 1927. It stands ten stories and once held over of retail space; the exterior was decorated in cast iron and leaded glass accents with flower designs and the Woodward & Lothrop monogram. It was declared a D.C. Historic Landmark in 1964.\n\nAfter the chain's liquidation, the store stood empty while developers and city officials debated its future. The city first lobbied to have the location reopened as a Macy's, but Macy's owner, Federated Department Stores (now Macy's Inc), demurred; the space was too large, in need of renovation, and situated in downtown Washington, where shopping had declined relative to the suburbs. Finally, the Washington National Opera purchased the building in 1996 for $18 million, seeking to have it renovated into its new home.\n\nUnfortunately, the cost of converting the retail space into an opera house proved daunting: $200 million. It remained empty until 1999 when it was sold to developer Douglas Jemal for $28.2 million. Neighborhood activists wanted Jemal to convert the building for mixed use, including arts space, restaurants, and housing as well as retail, but Jemal sought to use it for mixed office and commercial space instead. The District of Columbia Zoning Commission declined Jemal's proposal, and the building remained empty for two more years.\n\nFinally in 2001, the Commission approved the retail-office plan (on the condition Jemal build housing at another site), and renovation got underway. The building reopened after almost a decade in 2003. Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) was the first major tenant.\n\nOn January 29, 2004, a fire struck the building. Just before 10pm, firefighters responded to visible heavy fire on the 10th Street side. After twenty minutes, most of the fire was knocked down; the cause of the fire was found to be accidental, probably caused by a baseboard space heater.\n\nOn August 21, 2007, furniture and housewares retailer West Elm opened in the building. Also in 2007, a three-floor Zara also opened in the building while the D.C. branch of Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in the adjacent building, Rich's Shoes, which had been a holdout as Woodward & Lothrop expanded its old flagship store to cover the entire block (see photo at right).\n\nBesides the downtown Washington store, the old Woodward & Lothrop Service Warehouse at 131 M Street, Northeast was also declared a D.C. Historic Landmark in 1993. An example of Streamline Moderne architecture, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. \n\nBoth Woodward and Lothrop became active in civic life. Woodward, for instance, became president of the Washington City YMCA in 1898, and donated significant sums of money for the renovation of its facilities. In addition, Woodward's daughter and heir, Helen, and her husband Luke Ingalls Wilson later donated the bulk of the acreage of their Bethesda estate for the formation of the National Institutes of Health. After Wilson's death from cancer, Helen was instrumental in the creation of the National Cancer Institute. The store they founded itself became a fixture. In the 1920s it boasted at least 67 retail departments, as well as a travel agency, theater, infirmary, merry-go-round, and traveling art exhibits. According to one customer, Woodies was truly part of the social fabric; part department store, restaurant, and showcase for talent shows. Proper young ladies from schools such as Bryn Mawr, Stephens, Vassar, Radcliffe and Mt. Holyoke would troop into Woodies for their spring and summer frocks to wear at weekend dances.\n\nThe Woodward & Lothrop toy department introduced two phenomena to the American public. Harold and John Porter, who comprised the Porter Chemical Company of Hagerstown, Maryland, began manufacturing chemistry sets in 1916. Woodward & Lothrop became the first major retailer to offer them for sale, and \"Chemcraft\" kits soon appeared at other retailers in the country. \n\nIn the 1950s, the wife of a Woodward & Lothrop buyer saw a demonstration of Play-Doh modeling clay at an educational convention. This led to a successful in-store demo, and the sale of Play-Doh in W&L stores, and soon in toy departments throughout the United States.\n\nSlush mugs, which made Smoothie-like \"slush\" drinks out of soda or fruit juice when frozen, was a Woodies specialty in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2209933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209933", "title": "U Saw", "text": "U Saw\n\nU Saw, also known as Galon U Saw ( or , lit. Garuda U Saw, ; 16 March 1900 – 8 May 1948), was a leading Burmese politician who served as Prime Minister of British Burma during the colonial era before the Second World War. He is also known for his role in the assassination of Burma's national hero Aung San and other independence leaders in July 1947, only months before Burma gained independence from Britain in January 1948. He was executed by hanging for this assassination.\n\nU Saw was born on 16 March 1900 in Okpho, Tharrawaddy District, British Burma. He is the second son of four of the landowner Phoe Kyuu and Daw Pann. He educated at Roman Catholic missionary school in Gyobingauk. In 1927, he became a senior lawyer. He was married to Than Tin.\n\nA lawyer by training, U Saw first made his name by defending Saya San, a former monk and medicine man, who became the leader of the \"Galon\" Peasant Rebellion (1930–32), at his trial by the British colonial government, and came to be known as Galon U Saw. In 1935, he purchased the \"Thuriya\" (Sun) newspaper and turned it into a device to promote himself and his political interests. He was elected to the Legislative Council in the 1936 general elections as a member of the United GCBA. Two years later he formed the Patriot's Party, and from 1940 until 1942 he served as the third Prime Minister of Burma. In November 1941, he travelled to London in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a promise from Winston Churchill that Burma be granted Dominion status after the Second World War; at the same time, he made contact with the Japanese to secure his own political future should Japan invade Burma. The British discovered incriminating papers relating to the communications, and U Saw was detained for 4 years in Uganda.\n\nUpon his return to Rangoon after the War, U Saw saw himself as a contender for the office of the first Prime Minister of independent Burma. However, the first postwar elections in Burma of April 1947 returned an overwhelming victory for Aung San's Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) organization. The victory of the AFPFL had been interpreted as a universal endorsement of Aung San, but that was far from the truth. The AFPFL was a coalition of widely divergent political parties including primarily Communists, Socialists, and the Burma National Army (BNA) led by Gen. Aung San, and, as the subsequent civil war in Burma demonstrated, no single group or individual could claim to lead it effectively as a whole; many to this day however believe that if Aung San had lived the course of modern Burmese history would have been very different, for he was the one leader that could unite the numerous and diverse ethnic minorities as well as the fractious and disparate political groups. Nonetheless, Aung San became the leader of the Governor's Executive Council by virtue of the victory of the AFPFL.\n\nU Saw had attended, with Thakin Nu (the Socialist leader who became the first Prime Minister of independent Burma as a direct consequence of the untimely death of Aung San and the earlier expulsion of the Communists from the AFPFL), the first Panglong Conference in March 1946, convened by the Yawnghwe Sawbwa Sao Shwe Thaik to discuss the future of the Shan States; the Kachin, Chin and Karen representatives were also invited. It made no impact however on the Frontier Areas Administration (FAA), although a United Burma Cultural Society was formed as a result with Sao Shwe Thaik as chairman and U Saw as secretary.\n\nIn January 1947, U Saw and the Socialist leader Thakin Ba Sein were the only members of the delegation to London, headed by Aung San, to negotiate with the British government for Burmese independence, who refused to sign the Aung San-Attlee Agreement. Also by 1947, political parties had set up their own militia including Aung San's \"Pyithu Yèbaw Tat\" (People's Volunteer Organisation or PVO; ), and U Saw too formed his own pocket army called the \"Galon tat\" (Garuda Militia, ) to commemorate his defence of the Galon rebel prisoners. The former British Governor Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith had appeared to favour older pre-war politicians such as U Saw and Sir Paw Tun, whose popularity was now at a low ebb. The new Governor, Sir Hubert Rance, along with Lord Mountbatten of Burma, however, decided to back Aung San and the AFPFL, inviting them to join the Executive Council in order to calm the post-war political unrest.\n\nOn 19 July 1947, a gang of armed paramilitaries broke into the Secretariat Building in downtown Rangoon during a meeting of the Executive Council (the shadow government established by the British in preparation for the transfer of power) and assassinated Aung San and six of his cabinet ministers; a cabinet secretary and a bodyguard were also killed. The evidence clearly implicated U Saw as the ringleader. U Saw and eight others behind the situation were arrested by the British authorities, and tried before a special tribunal set up by Sir Hubert Rance, the British colonial governor. U Saw was found guilty and sentenced to death on December 30, 1947. After Burma became independent in January 1948, the Burmese authorities decided to carry out the verdict of the British court, and in March 1948, the Rangoon High Court rejected his claims that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction and requests for a new trial, and upheld the death sentence. He was executed by hanging at Insein Jail on 8 May 1948. U Saw was buried, according to custom, in an unmarked grave within the prison.\n\nMany mysteries still surround the assassination. There were rumours of a conspiracy involving the British — a variation on this theory was given new life in an influential, but sensationalist, documentary broadcast by the BBC on the 50th anniversary of the assassination in 1997. What did emerge in the course of the investigations at the time of the trial, however, was that several low-ranking British officers had sold guns to a number of Burmese politicians, including U Saw. Shortly after U Saw's conviction, Captain David Vivian, a British Army officer, was sentenced to five years imprisonment for supplying U Saw with weapons. Captain Vivian escaped from prison during the Karen uprising in Insein in early 1949. Little information about his motives was revealed during his trial or after the trial.\n\n\n\n"}

The league is headquartered in Japan. At the end of the playoffs every year the winner is awarded the Championship Trophy.\n\nThe league was formed in 2003 due to declining popularity in the Japan Ice Hockey League and the folding of the Korean Ice Hockey League. It was formed with the goal of promoting hockey and developing players' skills. The league initially comprised five teams in two countries. It expanded to highs of four countries (2004–05 season) and nine teams (2005–06 season) and it comprised eight teams from three countries in the 2013–14 season. Prior to the 2014–15 season a team from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, HC Sakhalin, was affiliated to the league.\n\nThe league draws most of its players from the home countries of its teams. However, the league allows each team a certain number of foreign imports on their roster.\n\nThe league was formed after the collapse of the Korean ice hockey league and dissolution of the Japanese league. It was started with the goal of promoting hockey in Asia as well as helping the various participating countries develop their hockey programs and increase their showing in the Olympics. The first season was a shortened season of only five teams, and played as a tournament rather than a regular season. Four Japanese teams and a Korean team participated. The tournament lasted just two months and each team played four games, two at home and two away, against each other. Due to the shortened tournament format, there were no playoffs and the winner was declared from the point tally. The Nippon Paper Cranes won the tournament with 39 points. and Joel Prpic from Kokudo was the assist and points leader with 25 assists and 33 points. Ryan Haruo Kuwabara, of the Cranes, was the scoring leader with 15 goals.\n\nThe 2004–05 season was the first full season for the league, and was seen by some to be the inaugural season. Before the season began, there was already interest by the National Hockey League (NHL) in China's hockey program. In addition to the five teams which took part in the tournament the year before, the league added Golden Amur from Russia as well as Harbin and Qiqihar from China. The first season had a schedule of 42 games. Teams played each other six times during the season. In December 2004 there was speculation by the South Korean media that North Korea could potentially field a team in the league, but that never materialized. The league also had an all-star game which took place on 22 and 23 January 2005 in Kushiro. The league was broken up into two teams, the Blue Orion and Red Antares. Fans voted on their favorite players and coaches. The most popular vote was for the forward position on the Blue Orion which received over 45,000 votes. Masatoshi Ito received the most votes with 9741. The skill competition and game were both won by the Blue Orion. The regular season finished with the Nippon Paper Cranes and Kokudo both having 98 points. After applying the league's tie-breaking procedure, the Nippon Paper Cranes were ranked first. The Nippon Paper Cranes also won the points race holding the top three spots in goals scored with Masatoshi Ito taking top honours at 33 goals. Darcy Mitani, also from the Cranes, took top spot in assists with 44 and points with 69. The playoffs saw the top four teams advance. The Golden Amur were swept in three games by Kokudo and the Cranes beat the Oji Paper in a close series, three games to one. The final was between the Cranes and Kokudo. While the Cranes won the first game, Kokudo won three games straight and won the playoffs. Chris Yule of Kokudo acquired ten points in the playoffs to lead the league while Chris Lindberg of the Cranes led the league in goals scored with six. Several players from Kokudo and the Cranes all had five assists. The 2005 ALH Awards were held in Tokyo and announced in April. Among the awards Kikuchi Naoya a goaltender for Kokudo was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Matsuda Keisuke of the Nikkō Ice Bucks was voted Young Guy of the Year.\nThe 2005–06 season saw a number of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to financial trouble. At the same time it was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a second year in a row with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the Cranes.\n\nFurther changes were seen in the league in the 2006–07 season. After the last season The Nordic Vikings were looking for sponsors for the team. However, they failed to find sufficient sponsorship and left the league due to financial trouble. Harbin moved their home rink to Beijing and changed their name to Hosa to reflect this. Qiqihar acquired a new sponsor and changed their name to Changchun Fuao. Kokudo also changed their name to the Seibu Prince Rabbits. With eight teams, the league further reduced the number of games played to 34, which again resulted in an uneven play schedule. The Chinese-based teams, for example, played each other and the Korean teams each six times but only played the Japanese teams four times. The Paper Cranes easily won the regular season again finishing first with 86 points. With the previous year's goal leader not participating the scoring race went to Tim Smith of Kangwon Land. He led the league with 30 goals. Patrik Martinec of Halla led the league with 53 assists and 71 points. The playoffs followed the same format as the year before and six teams advanced. Kangwon Land swept Halla in three games and Oji Paper beat the Ice Bucks three games to one. While it was inevitable with two Korean teams facing each other, it marks the first time a non-Japanese team won a playoff series in Asia League. The second round was over quickly as the Cranes and Rabbits who both had byes swept their opponents in three games each. For the third year in a row the final was between the Paper Cranes and the Rabbits. The Cranes took the series in four games. Joel Prpic won himself another scoring title as he led the playoffs in goals, 8, and points, 17. Kengo Itoh for the Cranes had the most assists with 13. At the awards ceremony Itoh also took the award for MVP of the Year while Jun Tonosaki received the award for Young Guy of the Year.\nThe 2007–08 season started with a further reduction in teams. Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became owned and operated by the San Jose Sharks. They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks. Kangwon Land renamed to High1. With only seven teams, the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games. The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did. After three years of dominance, the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits. Alex Kim, playing for High1, recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51. Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top of the pack with 30 assists. With six of seven teams going to the playoffs, the Sharks were the only team that didn't find themselves in a playoff spot. The first round was over quickly as the Cranes swept Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks. Nippon faced their rivals, the Rabbits, in the second round and defeated them three to one. High1 couldn't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were swept by Oji in three games. For the first time, the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits. Oji continued to roll over their opponents and swept the Cranes, marking the only time a team in Asia League had swept its way through three rounds. Due to their dominance on the ice, the point race was also swept by Oji. Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points, while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6. Kunihiko Sakurai, also from Oji, won the MVP of the Year and Eum Hyun-seung, from High1, won the Young Guy of the Year award.\n\nAfter several years of many changes to the teams, the 2008–09 season came with only one change. Oji Paper renamed themselves to Oji Eagles in July 2008. The league increased China's allowance to seven import players to help their competitiveness. Prior to the start of the regular season a series of exhibition games, dubbed \"Anyang Cup 2008\" was held in Anyang. Five of the seven teams in the league participated with the Ice Bucks and Rabbits sitting out. Oji won the exhibition tournament without losing a game. The league increased the number of games played to 36 and balanced the schedule by having all teams play each other an equal amount. Early in the season the Halla coach, Shim Eui-sik was suspended for refusal to play after a disputed goal against High1. Halla was forced to forfeit the game, but at the end of the regular season they had finished in first place with 76 points, becoming the first non-Japanese team to do so. Brock Radunske of Halla finished first in goals and points with 29 and 57 respectively. Kunihiko Sakurai, a previous MVP, finished on top with 40 assists in the regular season. The league reduced the number of teams making the playoffs and only five teams advanced. The first round saw a short three games series between the Cranes and High1. The Cranes swept High1 in two games. The second round found the regular season winners, Halla, facing the Cranes and Oji facing the Rabbits. Halla and the Cranes took it to seven games, but Halla lost on home ice. After the previous year's record setting playoff run, Oji found themselves swept by the Rabbits in four games. For the fourth time in five years the final was between the Rabbits and Cranes. The Cranes won for the second time. The Cranes swept the playoffs point race with Kengo Itoh taking the lead with 16 assists and 21 points. Masahito Nishiwaki led with 12 goals. Brock Radunske took the award for MVP of the Year marking the first time the award has gone to an import player. Young Guy of the Year went to Kim Ki-sung, also from Halla.\n\nAfter a season with little change to the make-up of the league, the 2009–10 saw further change. The San Jose Sharks ended their association with the Chinese team. They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent. The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost. The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon. Midway through the previous season the Seibu Prince Rabbits announced that due to financial difficulties they would withdraw from the league at the end of the 2008–09 season. They were unable to find a buyer and the team folded. However, another team from Japan joined the league in the off-season. The Tohoku Free Blades were able to hire enough players and imports to join the league in time for the beginning of the season. This again left the league with seven teams. The league left the number of games played at 36, marking the first time that the league didn't adjust the schedule from the previous year. The league also introduced a couple of rules changes. All face-offs will take place on one of the nine face-off dots as well teams will no longer be allowed to change after an icing. Anyang Halla repeated as the regular season champions finishing with 79 points and 23 wins. The team also set the record for the most goals by a team in a 36-game season with 180. Alex Kim and Tim Smith lead the points race. Both finished with 75 points on the season, with Kim taking the goal scoring race with 29 and Smith taking the assists race with 48. The League further reduced the number of teams making the playoffs to only four. As well they brought in referees from outside the league to assist in officiating. The two Korean teams faced each other in one semi-final guaranteeing for the first time that a Korean team would appear in the final. Halla defeated High1 in four games after a loss on home ice. The Cranes similarly defeated the Eagles in four games. The final was a close series, needing all five games and with four of the five games only being decided by a single goal. In the final game, Halla tied the game with 17 seconds remaining and in over-time the team captain, Kim Woo-jae scored to give Halla a victory and mark the first time a non-Japanese team had won the cup. In the play-offs Brock Radunske led with six goals and 13 points overall while Darcy Takeshi Mitani led with 8 assists. Patrik Martinec took regular season MVP honors, and Cho Min-ho, also from Halla, was named Young Guy of the Year.\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw virtually no change to the structure of the season or league. All teams from the previous season remained in the league, and the number of games remained at 36. The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, with a couple of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final for the first time in their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could not go on. On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, a new Seoul-based team, Daemyung Sangmu, joined the league, and prior to the 2014–15 season a team from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, HC Sakhalin, was affiliated to the league.\n\nSince its foundation in 2004, 15 different clubs have played in the ALIH, and 12 of them have at least once qualified for the playoffs. The table below gives the final regular-season ranks for all teams, with the playoff performance encoded in colors. The teams are ordered by their best championship results.\n\nEach Asia League Ice Hockey regulation game is an ice hockey game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions. While some teams have television broadcast contracts, they do not take television time-outs like the NHL. At the end of the 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime is five minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. In a playoff game the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.\n\nAsia League Ice Hockey was established primarily for the development of ice hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Initially, China was allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams were allowed the fewest. In the early seasons, the China Dragon was provided with western players from the San Jose Sharks as part of the sponsorship deals, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league. Prior to the 2018–19 season, the players from Russia were treated as imports if playing for a non-Russian teams; since the 2018–19 season, each team can have two import players, while the players with Russian citizenship are no longer treated as imports.\n\nSeveral former National Hockey League players have played in the league, including Chris Allen, Greg Parks, Esa Tikkanen, Chris Lindberg, Tavis Hansen, Shjon Podein, Jason Podollan, Derek Plante, Steve McKenna, Jarrod Skalde, Joel Prpic, Tyson Nash, Jamie McLennan, Shane Endicott, Wade Flaherty, Kelly Fairchild, Brad Tiley, Ricard Persson, Bryan Young, Claude Lemieux, Brad Fast, Ric Jackman and Cole Jarrett.\n\nEarly in its existence, the league hoped to quickly expand to twelve teams, but due to some teams having financial difficulties they didn't attain it. In the 2019–20 season, the Asia League Ice Hockey consists of seven teams; four teams from Japan, two teams from South Korea, and one from Russia.\n\nThe Asia League Ice Hockey season is divided into three parts. The late summer and early autumn parts consist of training camps and exhibition play. After that, the regular season takes place, which lasts for several months depending on the schedule. Finally several teams advance to a post-season playoff. This is an elimination tournament where teams play a \"best-of\" format to advance through the rounds. The final remaining team is crowned the champion for the year.\n\nThe regular season has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the number of teams changing from season to season in the first few years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for a three-game series and also play a three-game series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.\n\nThe league ranks the teams by points. A regulation time win is worth three points. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, both teams receive one point. The team which is victorious either in the overtime period or overtime shoot-out receives an additional point. A regulation time loss is worth zero points.\n\nAt the end of the regular season, the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past generally takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason. As with the regular season, the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled the end of the regular season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.\n\nAsia League awards several awards each season in addition to The Championship Trophy. Prior to the 2008–09 season the awards were issued after the postseason but in that season they were issued during the break between the regular season and postseason. The league presents awards for:\n\nAll of the awards, except for Best Hockey Town, are sponsored by an organization or individual.\n\n"}

Biograd is administratively part of the Zadar County. It is located on the Adriatic Sea coast, overlooking the island of Pašman, on the road from Zadar and Sukošan towards Vodice and Šibenik.\n\nBiograd na Moru is known as a tourist resort, with the first tourists arriving in the 1920s from Czechoslovakia, and its first hotel was built in 1935.\n\nThe town's native Croat name fully translates as \"the white town on the sea\". The name \"Biograd\" is a compound literally meaning \"white city\" and etymologically corresponds to several other toponyms spread throughout the Slavic-speaking world: \"Beograd (Belgrade)\", \"Belgorod\", \"Białogard\" etc. The name was first mentioned in the 10th century as a town founded by the Croats. It was rendered in Latin as Alba Marittima, meaning \"the white maritime (one)\".\n\nBiograd na Moru is located 28 km south from the county capital, Zadar. It is located on small peninsula surrounded by two little bays: Soline on south and Bošana on north; in front of it are the islands Planac and Sveta Katarina. Average temperature in January is 7.3 °C and 23.9 °C in July. The only settlement in the Town is Biograd na Moru itself.\n\nA three naved basilica was built on the basis of an older 6th century church during the reign of duke Branimir in the 9th century. The building later became the cathedral of the Bishop of Biograd. One of the very significant characteristics of this building are the semi-circular buttresses, found only on the buildings in Croatia at that time.\n\nThe city is first mentioned as \"Belgradon\" in the mid-10th century chronicle\" De Administrando Imperio \"as one of the populated towns in \"christened Croatia\". It was the centre of the county (\"županija\") of Sidraga. There are allegations that the bishopric was founded during this time based on a charter whose authenticity is disputed. Thus, this is not universally accepted by historians.\n\nDuring the wars between Croatia and the Republic of Venice in 1000, the town was captured for a brief time by the Venetians. During this time the Biograd was mentioned as a castle, and its citizens subsequently swore an oath of fealty to the Doge, who installed Vitale Michiel as a governor.\n\nDuring the 1050s, it is for the first time mentioned as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alba Maritima, a suffragan of Salona, until its 1226 suppression, when its territory was merged into the nearby Diocese of Skradin. The city flourished during this time. King Peter Krešimir IV founded the monasteries of St. John the Evangelist and St. Thomas in 1059 and 1066, both of them being three-naved basilicas. The nearby 9th century Cathedral was also expanded with a belltower and by adding the southern part of the walls. The function of \"prior\" (head of city elected by its commune in Dalmatia) is attested. The city was also a major port during the latter half of the 11th century. During the succession crisis in 1096, the Norman princess Felicia of Sicily disembarked in the port of the city to marry the Hungarian king Coloman.\n\nIt was the city where Coloman of Hungary was crowned in 1102 by the Biograd bishop Bono, as the crown of Croatia was passed to the Hungarians. In the subsequent years its rule was exchanged between Venice and the Árpád family. At this point, the city is mentioned as a \"royal city\" (\"urbe regia\") for the first time in surviving documents. The expanded name \"Belgradum supra mare\" (Biograd na Moru) is also for the first time attested during this period.\n\nAround the year 1115, the city was acquired by the Republic of Venice, which then tore down the city walls towards the sea, so it would \"for all times (\"per tutti tempi\") remain in the possession of the Serenissima\". It was eventually reconquered by Stephen II of Hungary in 1124. \n\nIn 1125, after it again fell to the Venetian hands, it was destroyed on the orders of the Venetian doge because of it vicinity to Zadar. According to the Historia Ducum Veneticorum, only the citizens of Biograd na Moru \"... dared resist the doge and his army ...\", during his reconquest of Dalmatia but \"... their city was razed to its foundations.\" The city core, consisting of the royal palace, ban's court, as well as monasteries and churches, was plundered. Much of the local monks fled to the nearby islands of Tkon and Pašman and the Biograd bishopric was abolished; its territories were added to the Bishopric of Zadar. The population, along with the bishop, moved to Skradin. A 15th-century drawing that depicts the ruins of Biograd also attest the bishop's palace beside the cathedral, as well as stone buildings and residences.\n\nIt was the capital of most Croatian regnants such as Stephen Držislav and Peter Krešimir IV, as well as an important religious place.\n\nIn 1202, when the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade occupied Zadar, many of its citizens took refuge in Biograd, then noted as \"Jadra Nova\" (\"New Zadar\"). Two years later, the most of them left back to Zadar, after which the city was also referred to as \"Jadera Vetula\" (\"Old Zadar\") or \"Zara vecchia\" in Italian translation. \n\nDuring the 13th and 14th century the city was run by the dukes of Cetina, the Knights Templar of Vrana and the dukes of Bribir the Šubićes. It was acquired by the Venetian Republic in 1409 and would remain its property until its downfall in 1797.\n\nDuring the Venetian-Turkish wars, the city was gravely damaged, and on two occasions, in 1521 and in 1646, it was destroyed and burned. In the 16th and 17th century, the Croatian militia formed in Biograd and had much involvement in the wars against the Turks.\n\nIn recent history, the Serbian forces inflicted considerable damage by long-range bombardment in the period 1991-1993 during the Croatian War of Independence.\n\nThe town and the settlement itself have a population of 5,569 (2011 census). The majority are Croats (95%).\n\nBiograd na Moru is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

The novel was originally written in first person and only changed 10 months before publication. After realizing that so much of the material—childhood sexual abuse and a long-lost father who eventually ends up in a mental institution—was too close to his own experiences, Irving postponed publication of the novel while he rewrote it entirely in third person.\n\nWhile the novel uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author, it treads new ground in taking on the fallibility of memory, specifically the memories of children (in this case, the memories of the protagonist Jack Burns). The story sprawls across Canada, a large part of Europe and the United States.\n\nThe first half of the narration follows a young Canadian actor named Jack Burns through his youth as he travels with his mother in search of his father through the subculture of tattoo artists. Like the title character in \"The World According to Garp\" and Irving himself, Jack finds a talent for wrestling and an extended family that aids and hinders him through his trials as a young man coming of age, including his sexual awakening and abuse as an adolescent.\n\nThe second half of the narrative sees Jack on the road to discovering the truth behind the misconceptions that his younger self once thought he understood.\n\nReception of the novel is poor. \"Publishers Weekly\" described the \"incessant, graphic sexual abuses [as] gratuitous\" but generally describes the novel positively: \"Irving handles the novel's less seedy elements superbly.\" Kirkus describes the novel as \"Irving's worst novel\". \"The Independent\" describes the book as too long, needing editing, and even recommends a book by William Maxwell rather than read the novel.\n\nIn the book, Jack earns the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 1999. In reality, this award went to John Irving himself in 1999 for his adaptation of his own book, \"The Cider House Rules\". Additionally, Jack loses the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor to Michael Caine, who also won for \"The Cider House Rules\" that year.\n"}

He also won a silver medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics, in the men's team sabre event in fencing. Herschmann is one of only a few athletes who have won Olympic medals in more than one sport.\n\nHe served as President of the Austrian Olympic Committee from 1912 to 1914. Herschmann was then President of the Austrian Swimming Federation from 1914 to 1932.\n\nDuring the Nazi era, Herschmann was persecuted because he was Jewish. The Nazis arrested him in Vienna and deported him in 1942 to the Sobibór extermination camp, and then to the Izbica concentration camp, where he was killed.\n\nHerschmann was Jewish, and was born in Vienna, Austria. He was affiliated with the 1.W.A.S.C. in Vienna, and the Wiener AC in Vienna.\n\nHerschmann first competed at the initial modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, at the age of 19 in the men's 100 metres freestyle swimming event. On 30 March, he and the other swimmers were taken by boat into the Bay of Piraeus to compete in the open sea. The competitors swam from a starting line between two buoys, through a course marked by a number of floating hollow pumpkins, to a red flag finish line at the shore.\n\nHerschmann placed second and won a silver medal, with a time of 1:22.8, 0.6 seconds and half a metre behind the winner, Alfréd Hajós, as the other swimmers trailed far behind.\n\nAinsworthSports.com ranked Herschmann as tied for the second-best swimmer of the 1890s, behind Alfréd Hajós. In 1904, he wrote \"Wiener Sport\", which was published by H. Seemann.\n\nIn the 1906 Summer Olympics, Herschmann competed in Athens in individual sabre, but did not medal. He returned to Olympic competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, competing as a member of Austria's sabre fencing team at the age of 35, 16 years after he first won a medal. On 15 July he won a silver medal in the team competition. In so doing, he became one of only a few athletes to win Olympic medals in more than one sport.\n\nOther Jewish fencers who participated in the 1912 Olympics included Hungarian gold-medal winning sabre fencers Dr. Jenő Fuchs, Dr. Dezső Földes, Lajos Werkner, and Dr. Oszkár Gerde, and Austrian silver-medal winning sabre fencer Albert Bogen.\n\nAt the time he won his fencing medal, Herschmann was serving as President of the Austrian Olympic Committee, a position that he held from 1912 to 1914. He is the only person to win an Olympic medal while serving as president of a National Olympic Committee.\n\nHerschmann was one of Europe's top authorities in sports. In November 1913, he traveled to various cities in the United States, including Boston, New York, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Chicago, to study US sports organizations and recruit trainers to work with Austrian athletes training for the Olympics. That month, when he was visiting the U.S. as the Austrian athletic envoy, the Boston Athletic Association gave him a banquet, and in December 1913 the Board of Governors of the New York Athletic Club held a banquet honoring him. He lauded the United States system for the quality of physical and mental training provided. He noted in contrast to the European system, high-quality training was provided to all athletes, not only those who lacked natural talent.\n\nHerschmann served as President of the Austrian Swimming Federation from 1914 to 1932.\n\nHerschmann was in private practice as a lawyer in the 1940s. He was persecuted during the era of the Nazis because he was Jewish. Herschmann was deported from Vienna on 14 January 1942 to Izbica concentration camp in German-occupied Poland.\n\nHerschmann died on 14 June 1942 (or on 17 June) in Sobibór extermination camp in Sobibór, Lubelskie, Poland, most likely by being gassed to death.\n\nHerschmann was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1989. On 7 November 2001 his hometown Vienna named a lane \"Otto-Herschmann-Gasse\" (Otto Herschmann Alley) in his honor in Simmering, the 11th District of Vienna.\n\n"}

Anton Alexander was the only child of his parents, Count Alexander von Auersperg and Baroness Maria Rosalia Cecilia von Billichgrätz. He received his education first at the University of Graz and then at Vienna, where he studied jurisprudence. In Vienna, he met with fellow Carniolan countryman France Prešeren, who would later become the national poet of the Slovenes. The two established a close friendship which lasted till Prešeren's death in 1849. Prešeren also dedicated an ironic short poem to Auersperg, called \"Tri želje Anastazija Zelenca\" (\"Three Wishes of the Green Anastasius\"), in which he made fun of the friend's bohemian lifestyle.\n\nIn 1830, Auersperg succeeded to his ancestral property, and in 1832 appeared as a member at the Estates of Carniola in the Lords' Bench of the diet in Laibach. Here he distinguished himself by his outspoken criticism of the Austrian government, leading the opposition of the duchy to the exactions of the central power. In 1832 the title of Imperial Chamberlain was conferred upon him, and in 1839 he married Countess Maria Rosalia, daughter of Count Ignaz Maria von Attems, Governor of Styria and Countess Aloysia Inzaghi von Kindberg . They had one son, Count Theodor Ignaz von Auersperg (1859–1881).\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1848 in Vienna he represented the district of Laibach in the German Frankfurt Parliament, to which he tried in vain to persuade his Slovene compatriots to send representatives. After a few months, however, disgusted with the violent development of the revolution, he resigned his seat, and again retired into private life. In 1860 he was summoned to the remodelled Reichsrat by the emperor, and next year nominated him a life member of the Austrian upper house (\"Herrenhaus\"), where, while remaining a keen upholder of the German centralized empire, as against the federalism the Slavs and Magyars, he greatly distinguished himself as one of the most intrepid and influential supporters of the cause of Realism, in both political and religious matters. He also served in the Diet of Carniola, where he was among the leaders of the Austrian Constitutionalists in Carniola, together with Karl Deschmann.\n\nIn Count Auersperg's first publication, a collection of lyrics, \"Blätter der Liebe\" (1830), showed little originality; but his second production, \"Der letzte Ritter\" (1830), brought his genius to light. It celebrates the deeds and adventures of Emperor Maximillian I (1499–1519) in a cycle of poems written in the strophic rhyme of the Nibelungenlied. But Auersperg's fame rests almost exclusively on his political poetry; two collections entitled \"Spaziergänge eines Wiener Poeten\" (1831), an attack upon the Metternich regime, and \"Schutt\" (1835) created a sensation in Germany by their originality and bold Realism. These two books, which are remarkable not merely for their outspoken opinions, but also for their easy versification and powerful imagery, were the forerunners of the German political poetry of 1840–1848.\n\nHis \"Gedichte\" (1837), if anything, increased his reputation; his epics, \"Nibelungen im Frack\" (1843) and \"Pfaff vom Kahlenberg\" (1850), are characterized by a fine ironic humour. He also produced masterly translations of the popular Slovene songs from Carniola (\"Volkslieder aus Krain\", 1850), and of the English poems relating to \"Robin Hood\" (1864). He also translated several poems by France Prešeren into German.\n\nAnastasius Grün's \"Sämtliche Werke\" (Collected works) were published by L. A. Frankl in 5 vols. (Berlin, 1877); the \"Briefwechsel zwischen A. G. und Ludwig Frankl\" (Correspondence between A. G. and Ludwig Frankl) was published in Berlin in 1897. A selection of his \"Politische Reden und Schriften\" was published by S. Hock (Vienna, 1906).\n\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1849, and in 1872 it merged with the Hartford & New Haven Railroad to form the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. The line is now the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line and part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.\n\nIn the early days of railroads, building a line along the north shore of the Long Island Sound was considered difficult due to the many rivers that fed into it. The first all-rail New York City-Boston lines ran north via the predecessors to the New York Central and Boston & Albany (B&A) railroads. Other routes involved combined water and rail routes, some going east via the Long Island Rail Road, other departing the East River waterfront of New York for ports in Connecticut, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts. However, railroad technology soon improved, and the NY&NH was chartered June 20, 1844, to build such a line from New York to New Haven, where it would connect to the Hartford & New Haven Railroad, which itself connected to the future B&A at Springfield.\nConstruction began September 1847 and the first train operated by January 1849. A March 17, 1848, agreement gave the NY&NH trackage rights over the New York & Harlem Railroad from Williamsbridge (now part of the Bronx) south into New York City.\n\nOn July 11, 1848, the recently opened New Haven and Northampton Company, running north from New Haven to Plainville (known as the Canal Line), was leased to the NY&NH. On February 16, 1850, the second part of the line to Granby was also leased; the rest of the line north into Massachusetts was never leased. Both leases expired June 30, 1869, and the company operated independently until 1887, when the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (NH) leased it.\n\nThe first superintendent of the railroad was R.B. Mason. He was succeeded by George W. Whistler Jr. In 1854, James Henry Hoyt of Stamford, Connecticut, became the third superintendent. When the railroad's first track was built in the 1840s, Hoyt had been a contractor grading portions of it, building bridges, and supplying ties. He then supplied the railroad with fuel and was again a heavy contractor when the second track was built. \n\nThe eastern half of the north shore line, from New Haven east to New London, was chartered in 1848 as the New Haven & New London Railroad, opening in 1852. In 1856 it was consolidated with the unbuilt New London and Stonington Railroad to form the New Haven, New London & Stonington Railroad, which was leased by the New York, Providence & Boston Railroad (NYP&B) in 1859. The line east to Stonington was never built and the company was reorganized as the Shore Line Railway in 1865. The NY&NH leased it on November 1, 1870, as an eastern extension of its line.\n\nOn September 7, 1870, the NY&NH and Hartford & New Haven agreed to consolidate into one continuous line from New York to Springfield, Massachusetts. This merger happened on July 24, 1872, forming the NH. The line has since passed into Penn Central, Conrail and is now mostly part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, with additional passenger service provided by Metro-North Railroad. The state of Connecticut currently owns the line from New Haven to the Connecticut border, and Metro-North controls the line from New Rochelle to New Haven. Just as in 1849, the line merges with the current Harlem Line in the Williams Bridge section of the Bronx to access Grand Central Terminal.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2209983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209983", "title": "United States Women's Bureau", "text": "United States Women's Bureau\n\nThe United States Women's Bureau (WB) is an agency of the United States government within the United States Department of Labor. The Women's Bureau works to create parity for women in the labor force by conducting research and policy analysis, to inform and promote policy change, and to increase public awareness and education.\n\nThe Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. He or she is supported by a staff in the national office as well as ten regional offices.\n\nThe Women's Bureau evolved out of the Woman in Industry Service, which was established on July 1, 1918 as a war-time service to employ women. It was headed by social activist Mary van Kleeck, who was the head of the Department of Industrial Studies at the Russell Sage Foundation. In 1917, amidst World War I, van Kleeck undertook an investigation of the possibility of employment of women in Army warehouses at the behest of the War Industries Board. She recommended the creation of a Women's Bureau in the War Department, and as a result President Wilson appointed van Kleeck to lead a new Women in Industry Service group, a sub-agency of the Department of Labor.\n\nAs such, she became the first woman in America appointed to a position of authority in the federal government. Van Kleeck wrote that the great numbers of women brought into the workforce by the war represented a \"new freedom\" for women: \"freedom to serve their country through their industry not as women but as workers judged by the same standards and rewarded by the same recompense as men\".\n\nThe Women in Industry Service group produced a series of reports documenting wage disparities, unsafe working conditions, and discrimination against female laborers, conducting investigations in 31 states. However, their recommendations were often ignored, and at an October 1918 conference to discuss women's labor organized by van Kleeck, Secretary of Labor William Wilson declined to take action to address wage inequality. In December 1918, the group published a wide-ranging report entitled \"Standards for the Employment of Women in Industry\", which was later used as the basis for the groundbreaking Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which applied basic working standards to men and women throughout the country.\n\nAfter the war, van Kleeck's group became the United States Women's Bureau. Van Kleeck helped write the law enabling this transition in June 1920. On July 14, van Kleeck was appointed as the head of the new agency within the Department of Labor. Although she was expected to lead the Bureau permanently, van Kleeck was called away to help care for her dying mother and resigned after a few weeks. Mary Anderson, her close friend and colleague, became its first long-term director instead.\n\nThe Bureau was established by Congress on June 5, 1920, just two months before women achieved the right to vote, and continues its responsibility to carry out Public Law 66-259; 29 U.S.C. 11-16.29 (1920) Their enabling legislation gives them the duty to formulate policies and standards to promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment. The Women's Bureau's collaboration with the National Consumers League and the Women's Educational and Industrial Union allowed the Bureau to effectively research and advocate for women workers.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, the Women's Bureau focused on women's working conditions in industries including manufacturing, household employment and clothing industry. 21% of American's employed at this time were women, who worked long hours with little wages. In 1922, the WB began investigating the conditions facing 'negro women in industry.' By focusing on minority groups, Mary Anderson, the Bureau's first director, was able to get social justice legislation passed for women since the administration largely ignored these groups. The WB successfully advocated for the inclusion of women under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which, for the first time, set minimum wages and maximum working hours.\n\nAs American men were mobilized for entering World War II, many women began working in nontraditional roles such as in aircraft plants, shipyards, and manufacturing companies. These jobs also paid more than traditional \"women's work\". The Bureau shifted its focus in this time to achieve more skills training, wider job opportunities, higher wages and better working conditions for the 'new' female workforce. The WB was an esteemed agency by 1942 and reports were consistently conservative, often repeating stereotypical ideas of women's strengths and weaknesses. However, the records of the Bureau during World War II contain a wealth of data and information about women with the focus remaining on the conditions of employed women, often neglecting middle-class women and continual support for special legislation for women's employment.\n\nIn the 1940s and 50s, the WB turned its attention how women's employment outlook and opportunities changed in the postwar period. After 1942, the Bureau officials hoped to have an audience in the federal government and to play a large role in labor mobilization. This hope never came to fruition and in April 1942, the War Manpower Commission headed labor mobilization. The Commission, led by Paul McNutt, rejected the idea of having any woman on his labor advisory commission instead creating a Women's Advisory Committee. However, both the Bureau and the Advisory Committee's advice regarding women's employment was often disregarded.\n\nin the 1950s and 60s, the WB developed policies and programs to increase women college graduates. The WB played an instrumental role in the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act. It effectively removed the ability to pay employees differently, based on sex. John F. Kennedy signed the law on June 10, 1963. However, during this time, the Bureau was opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) introduced by the National Woman's Party in 1923 until Kennedy took office in 1961. This was due to the commitment the WB had in maintaining protective labor legislation for women. During Kennedy's campaign, he needed to recognize a political constituency. However instead of supporting an ERA during his presidency, he created a Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. The Commission was headed by Eleanor Roosevelt, an ERA supporter, until her death 1962, after which the Commission was unofficially headed by Women's Bureau director and ERA opponent, Esther Peterson, who had advocated for the formation of the Commission early on. With Peterson as the de facto head, the final report by the Commission made no flat statement for or against passage of the ERA. It did, however, urge the courts to expand the 14th amendment to grant full Constitutional equality to women.\n\nElizabeth Duncan Koontz was the first Black woman to head the Bureau in 1969. The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women named Koontz a U.S. Delegate and with this added role, she worked with the Bureau to share research and expertise in developing countries. Under Koontz's leadership, the WB also worked to address and eliminate description against women and minorities in the workforce. They supported the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). Carmen Rosa Maymi headed the Women's Bureau in 1975 as the highest-ranking Hispanic woman in the Federal Government and the first Hispanic Director of the Bureau.\n\nFollowing the 1973 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) designed to train workers and provide them with public service jobs, the Bureau began developing programs for CETA funds that focused on special counseling and referral services, women in non-traditional jobs, pre-apprenticeship training and job development. Many of these new programs were also designed to help low-income women. The Bureau also had a role in the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Bureau started an on-site day care center. This led to the Bureau launching a major initiative to encourage employer-sponsored child care in 1982. The result of this initiative was the establishment of a multi-media Work and Family Clearinghouse in 1989 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, that mandated employers to provide employees job-protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons.\n\nThe Bureau focused on non-traditional employment for women in the 1990s, including apprenticeships and domestic workers. In 1996, the WB published a fact sheet on the workplace effects of domestic violence.\n\nIn 2014, the WB teamed up with the White House and the Center for American Progress for the White House Summit on Working Families convening businesses, economists, labor leaders, legislators, advocates, and the media for a discussion on issues facing the entire spectrum of working families, including workplace flexibility, equal pay, workplace discrimination, worker retention and promotion, and childcare/early childhood education.\n\nCurrently, the WB is assisting working women in a variety of ways to advance and improve women's earning power through opportunities for preparation and training for women in growth and in demand careers and by advocating for fair and equal wages. They also promote and advance workplace policies that reflect a 21st-century workplace for working women and families.\n\n\n\n"}

Dominican University offers more than 50 majors in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences and 20 programs in five graduate academic divisions, offering graduate programs in library and information science, business, education, and social work. Dominican university also has a School of Professional and Continuing Studies.\n\nThe school began as St. Clara Female Academy in 1848, chartered by Rev. Fr. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, O.P. in Sinsinawa, Wisconsin. It became a college in 1901 and moved to River Forest, Illinois, taking the name Rosary College in 1922 while under the leadership of Mother Samuel Coughlin of the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters. Trinity High School was founded as the preparatory department of the college before moving to its own campus nearby in 1926 and is still run by the order. The present name of Dominican University was adopted in 1997 as part of a strategic plan by President Donna Carroll to reflect the school's Dominican heritage and its status as a more comprehensive university.\n\nThe university operates under this mission statement: \"As a Sinsinawa Dominican-sponsored institution, Dominican University prepares students to pursue truth, to give compassionate service and to participate in the creation of a more just and humane world.\"\n\nThe school became coeducational in 1970.\n\nDominican University shares a tie to Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music. Sister Gregory Duffy famously advised the playwrights to form the Catholic nun background of the lead character, Maria.\n\nThe university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission to grant baccalaureate and master's degrees, and by seven other programs; American Library Association, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Social Work Education, the National Council for Teacher Education, the Accreditation Review Commission for the Physician Assistant, Inc, the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics, and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\n\nDominican University offers more than 40 undergraduate majors, and several pre-professional programs. The student to faculty ratio is 12:1 at this University. Dominican's graduate school is divided into five academic divisions: the School of Information Studies (SOIS), the Brennan School of Business, the School of Education, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the School of Professional Continuing Studies.\n\nDominican University's School of Information Studies offers the Master of Library and Information Science and Master of Professional Studies in Library and Information Science such as Archives and Cultural Heritage Resources and Services, Data and Knowledge Management, Digital Curation, Digital Libraries, Informatics, Web Design, and Youth Services. Also, Dominican University's offers the Doctor of Philosophy in Library and Information Science (PhD).\n\nThe SOIS publishes a semiannual, peer-reviewed online journal called \"World Libraries\", a publication dedicated to \"librarians and libraries in regions without associations or agencies to encourage scholarly communication and professional development.\" The publication of \"World Libraries\" is coordinated by students studying internet publishing.\n\nAdministered by the SOIS, the Butler Children's Literature Center is one of the nation's premier centers for the study of children's and young-adult literature in the services of literacy, learning and a lifelong love of reading. As an examination center for children's and young-adult literature, it serves as a best-practices professional collection to support integration of children's and young-adult literature in classrooms, libraries, childcare centers, and homes.\n\nIn the fall of 2014, the university introduced a new bachelor of science in nursing degree program. A new clinical simulation laboratory was designed and built specifically for the program.\n\nDominican University is located on a wooded campus in suburban River Forest, just 10 miles (16 km) from downtown Chicago. Other campus features include a language learning center, a computer technology center, an art gallery, a chapel, a student center, the Lund Auditorium, the Eloise Martin Recital Hall, and the Stepan Bookstore. The five residence halls at Dominican University are: Aquinas Hall (Priory Campus), Coughlin Hall, Sister Jean Murray Hall, Mazzuchelli Hall, and Power Hall. More than 30% of all undergraduates live on campus. Most incoming first-year students live in double rooms in Murray or Coughlin halls. Murray is the newest residence hall, which opened in 2004 (as Centennial Hall; renamed after former college president Sister Jean Murray in 2012).\n\nCoughlin Hall is a residence hall. The Student Life office for campus organizations is in this building. The Wellness Center is in Coughlin.\nWhen this year's 50th reunion class of 1968 entered Rosary College as freshmen, like all other first-year resident students to follow in their footsteps, they were housed in the Coughlin dormitory. At the time, room and board cost around $1,000 annually. Today's students might pay a little more than that, but the facilities and experience are remarkably the same (still no air conditioning!).\n\nBuilt in 1960 and dedicated in 1961, Mother Mary Samuel Coughlin Memorial Hall – or simply “Coughlin” to students – is named in honor of Mother Coughlin who succeeded Mother Emily Power as prioress in 1909. The dorm houses 155 students in primarily double-occupancy rooms and connects to Power Hall on the second and third floors.\n\nThe building housed a common area in the basement which was referred to by students in the 1960s and 1970s as “The Smoker.” The lounge remained until 2006 when the old science building was demolished and the lounge was converted into the university's Wellness Center. The basement also housed storage rooms for luggage and bicycles, student mailboxes and laundry facilities. Today, the basement houses Dominican's Department of Student Involvement.\n\nThe Rebecca Crown Library has 300,000 materials in various formats and a fully equipped learning resource center. Dominican University's first library, containing the collections brought from St. Clara College in Sinsinawa, was located in what is now the Phyllis Skiffington Noonan Reading Room on the second floor of Lewis Hall. The current Library, named after Rebecca Kranz Crown, the wife of Colonel Henry Crown, Chicago philanthropist, and the library's principal benefactor, opened in 1972. Major renovations, which created the light, open spaces one sees today, were completed in 2002. The Media Center located in the library houses a 3-D printer and recording studio. The library houses the Archives and Special Collections. Dominican University's collections include materials related to the following: University publications, institutional records, architectural plans, foreign programs, student activities, student organizations, graduate programs, graduation ceremonies, marketing campaigns, lectures, and even a collection of civil war materials.\n\nWhile the first reference books in Rosary's old library where dispensed from packing cases on the third floor of Power Hall, today the university's 300,000+ volume of books has a much more suitable home in the Rebecca Crown Library.\n\nDedicated on April 11, 1972, the library is named for Rebecca Kranz Crown, the wife of Colonel Henry Crown, Chicago philanthropist, and the library's principal benefactor. Designed by the architects Perkins & Will Corporation, the 76,656 square foot building originally housed 260,000 volumes. The Graduate School of Library Science (now known as the School of Information Studies) was one self-contained unit on the ground floor while the three floors above served as the university library for 800 undergraduate students and 400 graduate students in the library sciences school.\n\nWhen Rosary College first established an undergraduate library program in 1930 and then began offering a master's degree in library science in 1949, the primary goal of the program was to train students to take on careers as public or school librarians. However, over the years, as technology advanced, the university began to recognize the important roles that computers played in the field of researching information. “Information Science” was added to the Library program's name in 1981 to reflect the growth and scope of the school's programs and in 1994, the need for an extensive renovation, to keep up with changing needs, became apparent. Plans began and the goal became to improve the physical space, restore it to the center of student life and incorporate new technology never dreamed of 30 years prior.\n\nFive enhanced classrooms were added on the third floor each with mounted projectors, VCR & DVD players, document cameras and sound systems. Two of the classrooms also have satellite capability and desks are wired for personal computers. On the second floor, a multimedia production classroom houses a Macintosh lab and on the first floor a training room for information literacy instruction was included with a satellite receiver and enhanced classroom equipment. On the lower level, student PC's were added and a café was opened to help bring a shared focus of social and intellectual activities to student life. Last, construction opened up access to the library on the second and third floors and students can now move freely between the library and Lewis Hall.\n\nThe Fine Arts Building is home to the Box Office, Lund Auditorium, Eloise Martin Recital Hall, Performing Arts Center, and Slate Lobby. In addition to performances, costumes can be seen on display and posters from previous events line the halls.\nFor twenty-five years, after the initial cluster of buildings were constructed on campus, the gymnasium served as the assembly room and auditorium for campus events. Weekly (and sometimes more frequently), folding chairs were set up and taken down to accommodate lectures, concerts, and plays. During this time, the speech and drama departments coped with inadequate facilities until May 31, 1950 when ground was broken on the new Fine Arts Building.\n\nMother Evelyn Murphy turned the first bit of soil with the spade still bearing the ribbons used in 1920 for the first groundbreaking at Rosary and in 1926 for Trinity High School. The building was completed in two years and dedicated on Sunday, November 2, 1952. The Fine Arts Building housed Rosary's first language lab as well as facilities for the music and drama departments, including a 1,182 seat auditorium and a 211-seat recital hall. As stated in a 1952 Chicago Tribune article to commemorate its opening, the building was “state-of-the-art” and included curved walls and an arched auditorium ceiling to reduce echoes, sound absorbent pads in the recital hall to push sound into the audience, and green “blackboards” and yellow chalk in classrooms to “reduce the long-standing gripe from students about blackboard glare.” While some of those “state-of-the-art” features have since been replaced to make way for 21st-century technology (electronic \"smart\" boards, no more blackboards), many of the building's features remain to help preserve its history.\n\nIncluded in that history is the well-known connection between Rodgers & Hammerstein's famous musical The Sound of Music and Sr. Gregory Duffy, the Dominican Sister and late theater professor, who taught at Rosary starting in 1942. Every summer, Sr. Gregory would travel to New York to go to the theatre and, in doing so, developed personal relationships with several famous actors & actresses, including Mary Martin whom she connected with after seeing South Pacific in 1949. Ten years later, when famous composers Rodgers and Hammerstein teamed up with Mary Martin and her husband, producer Richard Halliday, for a new project about the Trapp Family Singers, Sr. Gregory was contacted to provide an inside perspective on religious life for the musical's convent scenes. She began corresponding with Martin and Halliday who forwarded her letters to Hammerstein. She helped critique the script where reflections of Catholic traditions and interactions of the religious could be made more authentic and in late 1959, she communicated directly with Hammerstein and offered him spiritual guidance as he faced stomach cancer.\n\nThe university has long embraced the famous connection with The Sound of Music. It was staged in the Lund Auditorium in 2002, photos of Sr. Gregory with Mary Martin grace the walls of the Green Room named in Sr. Gregory's honor, and in 2009 the school invited community members to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the musical by coming to campus for a picnic and movie sing-a-long in the Lund Auditorium.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Rosary College, physical education was recognized as an important part of the curriculum. The first students (in the academic year 1922-1923) to take advantage of Rosary's new facilities in Power Hall and Mazzuchelli Hall, were required to attend six lectures on personal and community hygiene and four hours of physical training, per week. These requirements pertained to all resident and non-resident freshmen and sophomore students while elective courses in practical gymnastics and aesthetic dancing were open to junior and seniors; all students needed to pass a swimming test.\n\nBy the time this year's 50th reunion class of 1968 started their education, the college had expanded its offerings and students had a much wider selection of health and physical education courses to select from. Aimed at developing sound health habits and an appreciation for sports, Rosary offered education in common sports like volleyball, basketball, and softball, but also unique offerings like fencing, folk dancing, archery, creative modern dance, water ballet and ballet dance.\n\nToday, only three physical education & health courses are offered in the current catalog of classes: weight training, aerobics, and physical fitness. However, the Department of Athletics is robust in its offerings of NCAA Division III sports, intramurals, and recreation and includes in its philosophy their mission of offering “a diverse, challenging athletics program to supplement the rigorous academic curriculum.”\n\nThe facilities on campus for physical education and sports have also evolved and changed over the years to meet the needs of the college's offerings. The original gymnasium was built in 1927 and is now the fitness center, which can be seen from windows in the old grill just outside the bookstore. The natatorium was opened in October 1923 and was rebuilt in 1949. Today the natatorium's pool is closed and the space houses “The Underground”, a large meeting & social room.\n\nThe biggest improvements, however, to the sporting and athletics facilities on campus have been the additions of the Igini Sports Forum and the west campus soccer field. When intercollegiate athletics came to campus in the early 1980s it became clear that the current sporting facilities could not support the needs of Rosary's teams; at the time men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball. The groundbreaking for the Sports Forum and College Center took place on November 4, 1987. The facility included a 15,000 square foot new gymnasium with a capacity of 1,200, an elevated walking track, locker rooms and training facilities. In 1992, the Sports Forum was officially named the Igini Sports Forum. Dr. John P. Igini, a former trustee, made a gift in memory of his late wife, Jane Stromsen Igini ’49. The varsity, NCAA-regulation soccer field on the west end of campus is also a newly updated facility on campus. A natural grass field that had been used for many years was, in 2011, renovated with turf and an enclosed iron fence to help keep wildlife off the field.\n\nSince intercollegiate sports came to Rosary in the early 1980s, the number of teams using these updated facilities has continued to grow. Today, there are 13 intercollegiate sports—the newest being men’s volleyball--and a robust intramurals program are offered on campus.\n\nMany of the campus administration offices are located in this building including Admission, Bursar, Business Affairs, Dean, Financial Aid, Human Resources, Diversity, Public Safety, Registrar, and the Support Center.\n\nWhen Rosary College first began constructing new buildings on campus to expand the facilities, Power Hall, Power House (the original science building now the Magnus Arts Center) and Mazzuchelli Hall were the first three buildings to be erected. It was clear, however, that more space was needed. It was the Great Depression, however, and construction and money were hard to come by. Finally, in January 1931, ground was broken and Lewis Hall was built through the generous gift of $150,000 from Mr. and Mrs. William Lewis whose five daughters were Rosary alumnae. The building was completed as the third side of the campus’ quadrangle and was dedicated on June 1, 1932. Since opening, Lewis Hall has housed the university's main administrative offices and classroom space.\n\nToday, Lewis Hall is the first stop for many visitors to campus. Inside the main entrance, the Office of the President can be found on the left; Mulroy Lounge (once the East Parlor where guests were received) on the right. The building also houses many student service offices including the Registrar, Financial Aid, and Student Accounts, as well as the School of Education, the Brennan School of Business, the Dean of Students, Campus Ministry, the O’Connor Art Gallery and Lewis Lounge.\n\nAll alumnae/i of Dominican University and Rosary College, at some point in their student career, attended classes in Lewis Hall and most of the classrooms look remarkably the same over all these years. Outfitted with a bit more technology than they once were, many of the classrooms still have the original built-in cabinetry, doors and wood trim. They also, most likely, conjure up vivid memories of the professors and Sisters who had lasting impacts on their lives after Rosary and Dominican.\n\nThe MAC is home to Sr. Nona McGreal Center for Dominican Historical Studies and Scheduling and Event Services. The McGreal Center provides storage and access to historical artifacts pertaining to the Dominican church system as the National Research and Archival Center for the Study of the History of the Dominican Family in the United States \n\nSince 1922, all of the science and home economics classes were held in Power House, the building that would later be called the Albertus Magnus Science Building and is now the Magnus Arts Center. The original building was not intended for academic purposes and as the college grew in the decades after moving to River Forest, the need for expanded facilities became urgent. Ground was broken on August 8, 1958, on an addition to the existing science building. Completed in 1959 and designed by Naess and Murphy Architects, the new addition included space for the home economics department, a physical chemistry lab & seminar room, the geology and geography departments and classroom and office space.\n\nFor 47 years, the building served as home to the sciences and housed laboratories and the home economics and, later, the apparel and fashion merchandising classes. By the mid-2000s the aging science building no longer met the academic needs of the university's rapidly expanding science and health sciences programs. With the Amazing Possibilities campaign, the university revealed plans to demolish the addition to the original science building. A new building, Parmer Hall, was constructed to serve the sciences programs offered at Dominican and in the place where the old science building once stood, a four-story parking garage was erected.\n\nToday, the Magnus Arts Center is home to the Sr. Nona McGreal Center for Dominican Historical Studies, scheduling and event services, dance and art studios and faculty offices. Alumnae/i are welcome to visit the McGreal Center (named for Sr. Mary Nona McGreal, OP ’42, a renowned historian, who wrote the Positio for Father Samuel Mazzuchelli that led to Pope John Paul II’s declaration that Samuel Mazzuchelli, OP be known as Venerable, the first step toward becoming canonized.) and to the greenhouse connected to the space\n\nWhen Mazzuchelli Hall was designed and first used in March of 1925, significant thought was paid to the four pillars of Dominican life: prayer, study, service and community. The Noonan Reading Room (the original library) and Rosary Chapel were designed next to each other and are symbolic representations of prayer and study. They are built over the Dining Hall and Social Hall – the hubs of community life, service, and celebration. Together, these four spaces center themselves as the heart of campus.\n\nDominican University's first library, containing the collections brought from St. Clara College in Sinsinawa, was located in what is now the Phyllis Skiffington Noonan Reading Room next to Rosary Chapel. Originally, the entire second floor was intended for the library – two huge rooms and high arched ceilings. When that plan wasn’t realized, the space originally intended to be the library was divided and half became the library while the other half the Rosary Chapel.\n\nSister Mary Reparata Murray, who established the School of Library Science in 1930, was the first librarian. In the summer of 1922 when St. Clara College, Sinsinawa, Wisconsin, moved to River Forest and adopted its new name, Rosary College, the nucleus for the library came with it. The library opened in October and essential books were shelved for the first time in the third floor lobby, then the library moved to what is now the sisters’ community room and a nearby stack room. The library remained in use until 1972, when the Rebecca Crown Library was built and the Old Library became a place for quiet study.\n\nAs for the chapel, that space has remained the campus's spiritual center since 1925, when the first mass was offered. Today, Rosary Chapel continues to be used for Sunday and daily masses as well as university events. During an $850,000 renovation in 2003, the chapel was repainted and air conditioning was installed, a new sound system was added and adjustable light fixtures and flexible seating were installed. A new color palette helped create an uplifting space. The original pews, carved by German immigrant Louis Marks, were removed, but many of his original hand-carved details, including shields and roses, were reused in the designs for a new altar, baptismal font, ambo and tabernacle stand. The university also received a grant in 2011 towards the restoration of the 1925 Wangerin organ. Additionally, a separate prayer chapel also was added to provide a space for quiet reflection and prayer.\n\nThe renovations were completed in an effort to better welcome students of all religious traditions and cultures in the hopes that students would have a space to revitalize their faith and expand their knowledge.\n\nMurray Hall, the campus’ newest residence hall, opened in 2004 in celebration of 100 years of education at Dominican University. Formerly known as Centennial Hall, when first constructed, it was later renamed and rededicated on September 27, 2012, when an anonymous $1 million gift to the university was given in honor of Sister Jean Murray, OP ’49, president emerita of the university and professor emerita of French, on the occasion of her 85th birthday and 60th jubilee with the Sinsinawa Dominicans.\n\nDesigned by Solomon Cordell Buenz, the modern (and only air-conditioned) dormitory on campus features double-room clusters (two double rooms sharing a common bath) and suite-style living options for up to 180 returning students. Each floor includes a lounge equipped with study tables, couches, chairs and Internet connection. Laundry facilities are located on the second, third, and fourth floors. Murray Hall houses students of all classes, from first-years to seniors. The building also has several ADA compliant rooms which are not available in the older dorms on campus allowing students with mobility and other disabilities to take part in a traditional residential college experience.\n\nIn 2007, Dominican University began a new building designed to incorporate the university's gothic identity. This $38 million facility is used for science and education classes. This building follows the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design criteria to minimize environmental impact. This building joins Murray Hall, a residence hall, and a 550-car parking pavilion among recent campus additions.\n\nThe dormitory first opened in the early 1920s. The first students to stay in the dorms were encouraged to live by “Spartan” principles. There were “no eatables, except fresh fruit, no jewelry brought to the college except a brooch, one ring, and a watch.” Tuition including room and board was $25.00 per quarter. It costs more today and students are allowed any snacks their hearts desire, but alumnae/i who roomed in Power Hall will be able to look at images from the past and easily recognize the tight quarters, distinctive marble and the porcelain sinks with mirrors built right into the wall.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, Power Hall was renovated and the dark built-in desk and wardrobe combinations that were originally installed in 1922 were removed. In their place, a light birch combination wardrobe and bookshelves were added. Each room was fitted with a freestanding desk and the rooms were painted a light color. In 2004, a second renovation took place and a new sprinkler system was installed, lighting was improved, wardrobes were replaced and ADA enhancements were added. However, in its 96-year history, no structural renovations have ever taken place, making Power Hall dorm rooms just as recognizable today as when the first students resided in them nearly a century ago.\n\nOn acreage purchased in October 1925, the St. Thomas Aquinas Priory was built and modeled to look like the castle of the family of St. Thomas Aquinas. It was completed in 1926 on a large tract of land at the northwest corner of Harlem Avenue & Division Street and housed The Dominican House of Studies, a college of philosophy for neophytes of the Catholic Dominican Order. 150 young men from around the country intent on entering the priesthood lived and studied on the campus. Taught by a faculty of twenty, the young men completed three years of study at the college and, upon graduation, would head to Washington D.C., to complete their studies for the priesthood. In 1964, a new wing was opened, but shortly after the addition was completed, attendance began to diminish and financial problems began to trouble the college. In 1970, after forty-three years of service, the college closed.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Province of St. Albert the Great (which counts Fenwick High School and St. Vincent Ferrer Parish among its many ministries) operated the Priory and it continued to be home to generations of Dominicans Friars. In early 2012, the Province announced that the Priory would be vacated as part of an assessment of all its Chicago-area properties. The building (and some of the land surrounding it) had been sold to Dominican University over a decade earlier and Dominican Friars had remained on site through a favorable lease agreement with the university.\n\nBy June 2012, the remaining Friars had moved into off-campus houses and the building underwent modifications and renovations to meet the needs of Dominican University. Today, the 30-acre campus is used by Dominican University to house 87 ELS, undergraduate and graduate students, and is home to the School of Social Work, the Siena Center and the Goedert Center for Early Childhood Education. Guests and alumnae/i are welcome to visit the Priory's beautiful chapel, the St. Thomas Aquinas Garden or stroll through the peaceful campus.\n\nDominican has a variety of campus organizations for students. They include cultural groups, department clubs, honor societies, and special-interest groups.\n\nDominican University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III since 2000 (previously NAIA). Nicknamed the \"Stars\", Dominican is a member of the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (formerly the Northern Athletics Conference. From the mid-1990s until spring 2005, Dominican was a member of the Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference, and a member of the Lake Michigan Conference until the spring of 2006. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and volleyball, while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball.\n\nDominican University's Men's Soccer team is annually ranked among the best in the nation. Since 2002, the Stars Men's Soccer has made 11 consecutive NCAA national tournament appearances, and have posted a 16–11 NCAA Tournament record (.593). The Stars have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen four times in program history (2003, 2006, 2009, 2012), to the Elite Eight three times (2003, 2006, 2009), and to the NCAA national semifinal game in 2009, when the Stars fell 1-0 to the eventual national runner-up, Calvin College. Since the NAC (now the NACC) began in 2006, the Stars have won all seven Men's Soccer regular season and tournament titles, and boast a conference unbeaten streak of 104 matches, and a conference tournament winning streak of 32 games.\n\nWith the 2012-13 academic year being his 19th at the helm, Head Men's Soccer Coach Erick Baumann boasts a career .801 winning percentage with a 311-69-22 overall record, ranking him in the top 15 amongst all NCAA men's soccer winningest coaches all-time, and fourth all-time among NCAA Division III men's soccer coaches. Additionally, Baumann's 311 career coaching victories rank him 20th in NCAA Division III men's soccer all-time while he is the only coach in the top 20 with fewer than 22 years as a coach at a Division III institution. In 1999, Baumann was featured in Sports Illustrated as the NAIA Region VII Coach of the Year as he led the team to the university's first-ever regional championship in men's soccer and the program's first appearance in the NAIA National Tournament.\n\nUnder Baumann's leadership, Dominican's Men's Soccer team has produced eight All-American athletes. The most recent to garner the award under Baumann was Lio Tovar and Michael Kapusta, first and second team selections respectively in 2010. In 2009, Mario Napiorkowski earned a spot on the 2009 second team. In 2007, Matt Kochanowski was a third team selection. In 2004 and 2005 respectively Erik Elizondo and David Niederholtmeyer were first-team selections. In 1997 Oscar Alvarez was named to the second team in 1997. In 1999, Carlos Carrillo and Oscar Alvarez were third team selections.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Dominican's historic 104-match conference unbeaten streak came to an end. Benedictine University's Edgar Reyes scored the lone goal which gave the Star's their first loss in conference play since October 2004. Benedictine and Dominican went on to share the regular season title with Dominican winning the conference tournament claiming their 12th consecutive NCAA bid. Benedictine was at it a year later when they beat Dominican again in a game that ended 2-1. Freshman sensation Nick Kapetanos scored the first goal and assisted Edgar Reyes on the second. Benedictine is the only team to beat Dominican in NACC play and they did it in back-to-back years. The next year was the same story as Benedictine beat Dominican 1-0 during the final regular season showdown. Dominican would get its revenge by beating Benedictine 3-2 in overtime the following week.\n\nRegional rivalries have developed with other notable Division III programs such as University of Chicago, Wheaton College (IL), Loras College, North Park University, and Washington University (St. Louis, MO).\n\nThe Library and Information Science Student Association and Society of American Archivists Dominican University Chapter is open to all School of Information Science (SOIS) Students. This association is run by students and provides a number of discussions, tours, workshops, socials, and service projects to help enrich the curriculum of SOIS students at Dominican University. The Library and Information Science (LIS) department also follows ALA accreditation so the programs provided by LISSA follow the American Library Association standards. Although the primary audience is SOIS students, all current Dominican University students are welcome to join and may submit requests for active membership through the Dominican University portal, EngageDU \n\n\n"}

Luskin (born January 21, 1950) is an attorney and partner in the Washington office of the international law firm of Paul Hastings, LLP. He specializes in White-collar crime and federal and state government investigations. Luskin is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he teaches a course in Global Anti-Corruption. Formerly, Luskin taught Advanced Criminal Law and Labor Racketeering at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\nLuskin is a graduate of Harvard University (B.A. degree) and Harvard Law School (J.D. degree), and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. Before attending Harvard Law School, Luskin worked as the Deputy Chief of the Washington Bureau for the Providence Journal. Luskin took a leave of absence in 1984 to work as Senior Speechwriter for the campaign of Geraldine Ferraro. He worked in the US Department of Justice, specializing in Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) enforcement, and helped supervise the ABSCAM investigation of the early 1980s. Since entering private practice, he has represented both witnesses and investigative targets in independent counsel, criminal, and congressional investigations, foreign corporations under FCPA investigation, In the course of his career, Luskin has argued not only in federal District Courts and numerous Courts of Appeal, but has also appeared before the United States Supreme Court. Luskin is admitted to the bars of the U.S. Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th,7th, 8th, 9th, 11th Circuits, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nRobert Luskin currently specializes in complex criminal and civil litigation at both the trial and appellate levels. Over the course of his career, he has represented foreign corporations, financial institutions, cabinet secretaries, federal judges and members of Congress.\n\nIn 1995, Luskin successfully represented a sitting federal judge in a criminal appeal to the Supreme Court, resulting in a landmark case narrowing the construction of the general perjury statute.\n\nIn 2004, Luskin successfully represented the Assessor for Orange County, California in a Constitutional tax case involving $5–8 billion.\n\nIn 2011, Luskin represented White House senior advisor and chief political strategist Karl Rove, representing Rove in the special investigations into the outing of covert operative Valerie Plame's position within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) specialist.\n\nLuskin was lead counsel for Lance Armstrong after the June 2012 allegations of blood doping by the US Anti-Doping Agency, a quasi-official American sports governing entity.\n\nSince 2012, Luskin has focused on civil and criminal investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has represented foreign corporations in three of the five largest FCPA investigations ever resolved by the DOJ and SEC: the settlement agreements in the investigations of Alstom, Total and Technip.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist James B. Stewart singled out Luskin as a lawyer who, unlike most criminal lawyers, was prepared to be candid with prosecutors, not permit his client to lie, and come forward with information. Stewart wrote further: \"These cases also illustrate that criminal defense lawyers have much to answer for. To his credit, Rove's lawyer Robert Luskin promptly revealed a damaging e-mail and had Rove amend his earlier testimiony that he didn't speak to Time's Matt Cooper. But other defense lawyers allowed their clients to lie in circumstances where they knew or should have known they were doing so.\"\n\nIn 1997, US Attorney Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island accused Luskin of \"willful blindness\" for accepting $505,125 in gold bars as well as Swiss Wire transfers of $169,000 from Stephen Saccoccia, after Luskin represented Saccoccia post-conviction. Whitehouse argued that Saccoccia's payments to Luskin were related to Saccoccia's broad money-laundering scheme and that the money should be returned to the government. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit considered Whitehouse's forfeiture claims in two separate opinions and both times ruled that there was no basis to seek forfeitures from Saccoccia's attorneys.\n\nWilliam Moffitt, VP of the National Association of Defense Lawyers, supported Luskin: \"if the case gets a high profile [or] they don't like the lawyer in it, they can immediately open this kind of assault,\" adding \"if you plead your client guilty, they're never going to go after your fee. So there's an incentive here to give the government what it wants.\"\n\nIn 1998, Luskin settled with the government, forfeiting $245,000 in fees. Whitehouse, on the other hand, went on to lose his 2002 gubernatorial bid due to civil rights controversies during his tenure as State Attorney General.\n\nDespite representing President Bush's top political advisor Karl Rove, Luskin is a proud Democrat and has donated to numerous Democratic causes. A Washington Post profile in 2011 described him as a \"man of somewhat Neiman-Marxist tastes\".\n\nIn 1995, Luskin was surprised to find himself described as the first male lawyer to wear an earring while arguing a case before the Supreme Court, before clarifying that if he believed that the earring would ever adversely affect his client's interests, then it would be \"out in a flash.\"\n\nLuskin splits his time between West Tisbury, and Washington, D.C.. Luskin often rides his motorcycle to work when in Washington. For longer trips, Luskin, a pilot, will fly his Cirrus SR-20 airplane.\n\nLuskin is married and has two sons and two step daughters. Luskin's step-daughters are currently in college, while his sons are working: one is based in the middle East where he is head of humanitarian access for an NGO providing aid to refugees in Syria; the other is a public defender in Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\n\n"}

Although the cave had been mined since 1911, miners did not notify authorities until 1912. The miners destroyed many of the artifacts, but archaeologists were still able to retrieve 10,000 Paiute artifacts from the cave. Items included tule duck decoys, sandals, and baskets, several dating back over 2000 years.\n\n\"Si-Te-Cah\" literally means \"tule-eaters\" in the language of the Paiute Indians. Tule is a fibrous water plant. In order to escape harassment from the Paiutes, the Si-Te-Cahs were said to have lived on rafts made of tule on the lake.\n\nAccording to the Paiutes, the Si-Te-Cah were a red-haired band of cannibalistic giants. The Si-Te-Cah and the Paiutes were at war, and after a long struggle a coalition of tribes trapped the remaining Si-Te-Cah in Lovelock Cave. When they refused to come out, the Indians piled brush before the cave mouth and set it aflame. The Si-Te-Cah were annihilated.\n\nSarah Winnemucca Hopkins, daughter of Paiute Chief Winnemucca, wrote about what she described as \"a small tribe of barbarians\" who ate her people in her book \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims\" - she wrote that \"after my people had killed them all, the people round us called us Say-do-carah. It means conqueror; it also means \"enemy.\" \"My people say that the tribe we exterminated had reddish hair. I have some of their hair, which has been handed down from father to son. I have a dress which has been in our family a great many years, trimmed with the reddish hair. I am going to wear it some time when I lecture. It is called a mourning dress, and no one has such a dress but my family.\" Hopkins does not mention giants.\n\nAdrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book \"Legends of the First Americans\". She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange. Another explanation for the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons may also come from the fact that the first remains unearthed by the guano miners in 1911-12, those of a man, were described as \"giant\" in comparison to the much smaller apparently female skeletons.\n\nA written report by James H. Hart, the first of two miners to excavate the cave in the fall of 1911, recalls that in the north-central part of the cave, about four feet deep, \"was a striking looking body of a man \"six feet six inches tall.\" His body was mummified and his hair distinctly red.\" Unfortunately in the first year of mining, some of the human remains and artifacts were lost and destroyed. \"The best specimen of the adult mummies was boiled and destroyed by a local fraternal lodge, which wanted the skeleton for initiation purposes.\" Also, several of the fiber sandals found in the cave were remarkably large, and one reported at over 15 inches (38 cm) in length was said to be on display at the Nevada Historical Society's museum in Reno in 1952.\n\nThe Paiute tradition asserts that the Si-Te-Cah people practiced cannibalism, and this may have had some basis in fact. During the 1924 excavation of the cave, a series of three human bones were found near the surface towards the mouth of the cave. \"These had been split to extract the marrow, as animal bones were split, and probably indicate cannibalism during a famine\".\n\n\n"}

The title was taken from a line in Act IV of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\": \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes.\" It stars Jason Robards, Jonathan Pryce, Diane Ladd, and Pam Grier.\n\nThe film was shot in Vermont and at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It had a troubled production – Clayton fell out with Bradbury over an uncredited script rewrite, and after test screenings of the director's cut failed to meet the studio's expectations, Disney sidelined Clayton, fired the original editor, and scrapped the original score, spending some $5 million and many months re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring the film before its eventual release.\n\nIn Green Town, Illinois, a small town enjoying the innocence of an upcoming autumn as the days grow shorter, two young boys, a reserved Will Halloway, and somewhat rebellious Jim Nightshade, leave from an after-school detention for \"whispering in class\" and hurry off for home. When the boys hear about a strange traveling carnival, Mr. Dark's Pandemonium Carnival, from a lightning-rod salesman, they decide to see what it is all about, but Will is fearful, as most carnivals end their tours after Labor Day.\n\nWhen the ominous Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man, rides into town on a dark midnight, setting up his massive carnival in a matter of seconds, the boys are both thrilled and terrified. It seems to be just another carnival at first, but it is not long before the forces of darkness begin to manifest from the haunting melodies of the carousel—which can change your age depending on which direction you ride it—and from the glaring Mirror Maze.\n\nWith his collection of freaks and oddities, Dark intends to take control of the town and seize more innocent souls to damnation. It will take all the wit and hope of the two boys to save their families and friends, with aid from an unlikely ally, Will's father, the town librarian, who understands more than anyone else that \"something wicked this way comes.\"\n\nRay Bradbury wrote the screenplay in 1958, intended as a directorial vehicle for Gene Kelly. Financing for the project never came, and Bradbury converted the screenplay into a novel, published in 1962.\n\nIn 1977, Bradbury sold the film rights to \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" to Paramount Pictures. He and director Jack Clayton, who Bradbury had previously worked with on \"Moby Dick\", produced a completed script. The movie was intended to be produced by Kirk Douglas' Bryna Productions, and Douglas was to have starred in it. However, production never began and the film was eventually put into turnaround. At various times, Sam Peckinpah and Steven Spielberg expressed interest in making the film.\n\nAt this time Walt Disney Pictures was concentrating on films with more mature themes in an attempt to break free from their stereotype as an animation and family film studio.\n\nThe studio sought Bradbury's input on selecting a cast and director, and he suggested Clayton feeling they had worked well together at Paramount. In a 1981 issue of \"Cinefantastique\", Bradbury stated that his top choices to play Mr. Dark were Peter O'Toole and Christopher Lee. However, Disney decided to go with a relatively unknown actor instead in order to keep the budget down, and Jonathan Pryce was eventually cast. As the film progressed, two differing visions emerged for the film, with Bradbury and Clayton wishing to stay as faithful to the novel as possible, while Disney wanted to make a more accessible and family friendly film. Bradbury and Clayton fell out during production after Bradbury discovered that Clayton had hired writer John Mortimer to do an uncredited revision of Bradbury's screenplay at the studio's insistence.\n\nAt a Q&A session following a 2012 screening of the film, actor Shawn Carson explained that he originally read some 10 times for the part of Will, but after a request from Bradbury, he read for and was cast in the part of Jim Nightshade instead. Although he had blond hair at the time, and co-star Vidal Petersen had dark hair, Carson's hair was dyed jet black and Petersen's was dyed blond to fit the new casting.\n\nFor the original score, Clayton picked Georges Delerue who had scored his films \"The Pumpkin Eater\" and \"Our Mother's House\", but his score (considered \"too dark\" by Disney) was later removed and replaced at short notice with a score by James Horner. A soundtrack album of Delerue's unused score was released by Intrada Records in 2015. Horner's replacement score was previously released by the same label in 1998.\n\nEditor Barry Gordon was hired as assistant to the film's original editor, Argyle Nelson Jr. He recalled in 2012 that after Clayton submitted his original cut, Disney expressed concerns about the film's length, pacing and commercial appeal; the studio then took the project out of Clayton's hands and undertook an expensive six-month reshoot and re-edit. Nelson was let go for budgetary reasons, and although Gordon was originally prepared to follow Nelson and leave the production, Nelson encouraged him to stay, and Gordon edited the final cut (resulting in the film's dual editor credits).\n\nDisney spent an additional $5 million on re-filming, re-editing, and re-scoring the picture, and Gordon was required to make a number of changes to Clayton and Nelson's original cut, removing several major special-effects scenes, and incorporating the new material (directed by Leo Dyer), including a new spoken prologue, narrated by Arthur Hill. Among the casualties was a groundbreaking animation scene, which would have been one of the first major uses of computer-generated imaging in a Hollywood film; combining the then new technology of CGI with traditional animation, it depicted Dark's circus train rolling into town, and the carnival magically materialising – the smoke from the locomotive becomes the ropes and tents, tree limbs grow together to form a ferris wheel, and a spider web morphs into a wheel of fortune. The deleted scene was previewed in detail in the May–June 1983 issue of \"Twilight Zone Magazine\", but in the event, the re-edit retained only a few seconds of the sequence. Another cut sequence depicted Mr. Dark using his sinister powers to send a huge disembodied hand to reach into the house to grab the boys – this mechanical effect was deemed not realistic enough by Disney executives, and was replaced by a new scene in which the room is invaded by hundreds of spiders. This was shot using real spiders, and years later Shawn Carson recalled the considerable discomfort he and Vidal Petersen experienced as a result being exposed to the irritating urticating hairs of the 200 tarantulas used in the sequence.\n\nThe original themes of Bradbury's novel, the suggestion of menace, the autumn atmosphere of an American Midwest township and the human relationships between characters that attracted Clayton escaped preview audiences completely, with Clayton heavily criticized. New special effects sequences were shot and a hastily composed new score by composer James Horner replaced Delerue's original music. Initial test screenings did not fare well with audiences, and Disney re-commissioned Bradbury to write an opening narration sequence and new ending.\n\nBradbury referred to the film's final cut as \"not a great film, no, but a decently nice one.\"\n\nThe film grossed $8.4 million at the domestic box office against its $19 million budget.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun Times\" gave the film three-and-a-half stars and said:\n\n\"It's one of the few literary adaptations I've seen in which the film not only captures the mood and tone of the novel, but also the novel's style. Bradbury's prose is a strange hybrid of craftsmanship and lyricism. He builds his stories and novels in a straightforward way, with strong plotting, but his sentences owe more to Thomas Wolfe than to the pulp tradition, and the lyricism isn't missed in this movie. In its descriptions of autumn days, in its heartfelt conversations between a father and a son, in the unabashed romanticism of its evil carnival and even in the perfect rhythm of its title, this is a horror movie with elegance.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said the film \"begins on such an overworked Norman Rockwell note that there seems little chance that anything exciting or unexpected will happen. So it's a happy surprise when the film ... turns into a lively, entertaining tale combining boyishness and grown-up horror in equal measure;\" according to Maslin, \"The gee-whiz quality to this adventure is far more excessive in Mr. Bradbury's novel than it is here, as directed by Jack Clayton. Mr. Clayton, who directed a widely admired version of \"The Turn of the Screw\" some years ago, gives the film a tension that transcends even its purplest prose.\"\n\nConversely, \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"must be chalked up as something of a disappointment. Possibilities for a dark, child's view fantasy set in rural America of yore are visible throughout, but various elements have not entirely congealed into a unified achievement ... Clayton has done a fine job visualizing the screenplay by Bradbury himself, but has missed really connecting with the heart of the material and bringing it satisfyingly alive.\"\n\nGene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote that it \"opens promisingly\" but has a script which \"tries to cram too much material into one story\" and a climax that \"couldn't be more disappointing,\" with \"neon special effects that overwhelm the last half hour of the movie. The result is an oddball combination of a 'Twilight Zone' episode with the climactic, zapping-the-Nazis scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.'\"\n\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film as \"one of Walt Disney's best efforts in recent years—a film that actually has something to offer adults and adolescents alike.\"\n\nRichard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" criticized the \"lethargic\" pace, \"stolid acting,\" and special effects that \"are shockingly poor for 1983 (a time-machine carousel is the only effective sequence on that front).\"\n\nTom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" lamented that \"the novel's texture has been thinned out so ruthlessly that little is left but the bare bones; and all they add up to, shorn of the slightly self-conscious Faulknerian poetics of Bradbury's style, is a dismayingly schoolmarmish moral tale about fathers and sons, the vanity of illusions, and homespun recipes for dealing with demons ('Happiness makes them run').\"\n\nChristopher John reviewed \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #15 and commented that \"If the chance ever comes your way to take this one in, grab it. Rarely does such a quiet, yet strong picture get made in this country.\"\n\nAs of September 2019 the film holds a 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews.\n\nIt won the 1984 Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film and Saturn Award for Best Writing; it was nominated for five others, including best music for James Horner and best supporting actor for Jonathan Pryce. The film was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and Grand Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nIn 2014, Disney announced a remake of \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" with Seth Grahame-Smith writing the script, making his directorial debut, and producing with David Katzenberg from their producing banner KatzSmith Productions. Reportedly, Grahame-Smith wants to focus mostly on Ray Bradbury's source material from the book.\n\n"}

The offeror is the master of one's own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a counter-offer, and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.\n\nThe English common law established the concepts of \"consensus ad idem\", offer, acceptance and counter-offer. The leading case on counter-offer is \"Hyde v Wrench\" [1840]. The phrase \"Mirror-Image Rule\" is rarely (if at all) used by English lawyers; but the concept remains valid, as in \"Gibson v Manchester City Council\" [1979], and \"Butler Machine Tool v Excello\".\n\nThis position is adhered to in Australia (New South Wales). If a person were to accept an offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: \"Masters v Cameron\" (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the original offeror is now the one who has to accept.\n\nIn the United States, this rule still exists at common law. However, the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") dispenses with it in § 2-207. (but it can also be argued that § 2-207(1) enforces the mirror image rule) Therefore, its applicability depends upon what law governs. Most states have adopted the UCC, which governs transactions in goods. Contracts for services or land, for example, would not be governed by the UCC. The 2nd restatement of contracts also provides that when parties have not agreed to an essential term, \"a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.\" However, it may not be possible for a reasonable term to be supplied by the court.\n"}

Later the married couple directed the romantic comedy-drama \"Ruby Sparks\" (2012), and the biographical sports drama \"Battle of the Sexes\" (2017). Their most recent directing project is the Netflix comedy series, \"Living With Yourself\", starring Paul Rudd, which premiered on October 17, 2019.\n\nDayton was born in Alameda County, California, and grew up in Grass Valley, California. After graduating from Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, California, he attended the UCLA Film School, studying film and television in the late 1970s; while there, he met Valerie Faris, a dance student and native of Los Angeles County, California, who became his wife and his partner. They have three children together. Valerie is the daughter of Paula Forbes, a supervising painter, and Jim Faris, a film editor.\n\nAs a pair, Dayton and Faris have directed and produced music videos, documentaries, commercials and films. They have directed music videos for bands such as Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, and R.E.M.. Their 1996 video for \"Tonight, Tonight\" by The Smashing Pumpkins won six MTV Video Music Awards. Another of their videos that found significant success was for the 1990 Extreme song \"More Than Words\".\n\nThey directed a number of sketches for the 1995-1998 HBO sketch comedy series \"Mr. Show\".\n\nIn 1998, they established a production company, Bob Industries. Through this company the pair directed commercials for companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Volkswagen, Sony, GAP, Target, IKEA, Apple Computer, and ESPN. The two directed a 1999 commercial for the Volkswagen Cabrio, titled \"Milky Way\", whose soundtrack consisted entirely of the 1972 Nick Drake song \"Pink Moon\", and which is credited with initiating a massive revival of interest in Nick Drake's music.\n\nThey began to be offered feature films to direct at around this time; among projects that they turned down were \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Bad Boys II\" (2003).\n\nIn 2001, they began to work on the film \"Little Miss Sunshine\"; it was released in 2006. The film won the Audience Award at the 2006 Sydney Film festival and an ovation at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Their directing style for the film involved a high level of improvisation to allow the actors to create organic connections to the roles.\n\nIn 2006, the pair were announced as the directors of a planned screen adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel \"The Abstinence Teacher\" for Warner Independent Pictures. In 2007 Perrotta wrote a screenplay with input from Dayton and Faris.

The album was released on October 16, 2001 via London-Sire Records. Two months after its release, the label went out of business, and the album was re-issued through Warner Music.\n\nFormed in 1998, 40 Below Summer had made a name for themselves by performing heavily across their native New Jersey and New York. In late 2000, the band's self-released CD \"Side Show Freaks\" found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Lead guitarist Jordan Plingos recalled \"I think the first thing that we clicked with Garth about was that he was relaxed. He wasn't like, 'let's go, guys, let's go!' He was more like, 'get comfortable, get settled in.' His whole thing is bringing out the best in you, so pressuring you to do something doesn't help. He was all about us, which was amazing\", while vocalist Max Illidge said \"He’s a lot of fun. He’s crazy too. Definitely a crazy little fucker, but he’s a lot of fun and a very talented guy. He definitely helped unlock some doors inside of me.\"\n\nNo conceptual music videos ended up being made to promote \"Invitation to the Dance\", in part due to issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire. Despite being one of the heavier songs on the album, \"Falling Down\" received moderate airplay, leading to it initially being considered. Max Illidge stated in 2002 \"We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap \"Falling Down\" and go with \"Wither Away\" for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away\" — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it and they were going to wait until early next year, but we knew that they were folding. We are not ever going to get that video.\"\n\nThe elderly man on the album cover also appeared in the 2000 music video for the 3 Doors Down song \"Kryptonite.\" The artwork concept was conceived by the band members and created by Los Angeles-based t42design.\n\nThe album combines the downtuned riffs of nu metal/alternative metal with elements of New Jersey hardcore, hip hop, jazz and hard rock. Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that \"the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots\". Songs such as \"Falling Down\" and \"Rejection\" feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings. Jordan Plingos stated \"If somebody asks me what this band sounds like, I say 'go listen to 'Falling Down,' because it has everything. It starts off fast and heavy and brutal, and then, from the bridge and chorus to the end, it makes you cry. That song right there covers it all.\"\n\n\"Step into the Sideshow\", \"Falling Down\", \"Rejection\" and \"Jonesin\" were all rerecorded songs that originally appeared on the band's independent releases \"Side Show Freaks\" and \"Rain\". D'Amico stated \"'Falling Down' is like the epitome of 40 Below Summer. There was no way that it wasn't going to make the album. 'Jonesin' is a sick twisted tale that we just wanted to tell. It's a true story. 'Sideshow' is like the anthem. It always gets the crowd going. 'Rejection'… I don't know. It's just a pretty heavy song so it made it.\" The song \"Power Tool\" was one of the earliest pieces of music written by the band. It was originally titled \"Monica\" (in reference to the Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton scandal) but had to be changed for legal reasons.\n\nAllmusic's Jason D. Taylor gave the album a positive four-star review, noting that \"\"Invitation to the Dance\" at first glance may seem to be just another hard rock album, but along with further observation it is apparent that 40 Below Summer is striving to spice up what modern hard rock became in the 21st century.\" He concluded his review by writing \"40 Below Summer's ability to keep the listener guessing and the album's repetitive appeal make \"Invitation to the Dance\" a surefire hit for those looking for something more out of hard rock than a down-tuned bass and simplistic lyrics.\" In 2015, VH1 ranked the album ninth on their list of \"The 12 Most Underrated Nu Metal Albums\".\n\nAccording to Max Illidge, the record has sold roughly 100,000 copies. He has also noted it is the only record 40 Below Summer do not control the rights to.\n\n\n"}

There are few moving parts, decreasing the need for lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher. A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful piston engine, so that a locomotive can be extremely powerful without needing to be inordinately large. \n\nHowever, a gas turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed, unlike a piston engine, which has a comparatively flat power curve. This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long-distance high-speed runs. Additional problems with gas turbine-electric locomotives include the fact that they are very noisy and produce such extremely hot exhaust gasses that, if the locomotive were parked under an overpass paved with asphalt, it could melt the asphalt.\n\nUnlike steam engines, internal combustion engines require a transmission to power the wheels. The engine must be allowed to continue running when the locomotive is stopped.\n\nA gas turbine locomotive was patented in 1861 by Marc Antoine Francois Mennons (British patent no. 1633). The drawings in Mennons' patent show a locomotive of 0-4-2 wheel arrangement with a cylindrical casing resembling a boiler. At the front of the casing is the compressor, which Mennons calls a ventilator. This supplies air to a firebox and the hot gases from the firebox drive a turbine at the back of the casing. The exhaust from the turbine then travels forwards through ducts to preheat the incoming air. The turbine drives the compressor through gearing and an external shaft. There is additional gearing to a jackshaft which drives the wheels through side rods. The fuel is solid (presumably coal, coke or wood) and there is a fuel bunker at the rear. There is no evidence that the locomotive was actually built but the design includes the essential features of gas turbine locomotives built in the 20th century, including compressor, combustion chamber, turbine and air pre-heater.\n\nWork leading to the emergence of the gas turbine locomotive began in France and Sweden in the 1920s but the first locomotive did not appear until the 1940s. High fuel consumption was a major factor in the decline of conventional gas-turbine locomotives and the use of a piston engine as a gas generator would probably give better fuel economy than a turbine-type compressor, especially when running at less than full load.\n\nOne option is a two-shaft machine, with separate turbines to drive the compressor and the output shaft. Another is to use a separate gas generator, which may be of either rotary or piston type.\n\nGas turbine-mechanical locomotives use a mechanical transmission to deliver the power output of gas turbines to the wheels. Owing to the difference in their speeds, this is technically challenging and so a mechanical transmission did not appear until ten years after the first electric transmissions.\n\nThe first gas turbine-mechanical locomotive in the world, Class 040-GA-1 of 1,000 hp was built by Renault in 1952 and had a Pescara free-piston engine as a gas generator. It was followed by two further locomotives, Class 060-GA-1 of 2,400 hp in 1959–61.\n\nThe Pescara gas generator in 040-GA-1 consisted of a horizontal, single cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. It had no crankshaft and the pistons were returned after each power stroke by compression and expansion of air in a separate cylinder. The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas-turbine which drove the wheels through a two-speed gearbox and propeller shafts. The free-piston engine was patented in 1934 by Raul Pateras Pescara.\n\nSeveral similar locomotives were built in the USSR by Kharkov Locomotive Works.\n\nThe power gas locomotive was built by Gotaverken. It had a vertical, five cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. There was a single crankshaft connected to both upper and lower pistons. The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas turbine which drove the wheels through reduction gearing, jack shaft and side rods.\n\nTurbine power was considered for railway traction in the former Czechoslovakia. Two turbine-powered prototypes were built, designated TL 659.001 and .002, featuring C-C wheel arrangement, 3200 hp (2.4 MW) main turbine, helper turbine and Tatra 111 helper diesel engine. \n\nThe first prototype was finished in February 1958 and was scheduled to be exhibited at Expo '58. This was aborted, because it wasn't ready in time. The first out-of-factory tests were conducted in March 1959 on the Plzeň–Cheb–Sokolov line. On 15 May 1959, the first prototype pulled its heaviest train, 6486 metric tons, but the turbine caught fire only a day later. The engine was never restored and eventually scrapped. \n\nThe second prototype was built with lessons learned from the first prototype. It left the factory in March 1960 and was the only turbine locomotive to pass the tests for regular service on tracks of the former ČSD. This engine was tried near Kolín and Plzeň with mixed results. This engine was taken out of service in April 1966 and sold to University of Žilina as an educational instrument. The locomotive was scrapped some time later.\n\nAlthough these experiments had mixed results, they were the most powerful locomotives with purely mechanical powertrain in the world and thus also the most powerful independent-traction locomotives in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe British Rail GT3 was a simple machine consisting essentially of a standard oil-fired gas turbine mounted on a standard steam locomotive chassis, built as a demonstrator by English Electric in 1961. Its almost crude simplicity enabled it to avoid much of the unreliability which had plagued the complex experimental GTELs 18000 and 18100 in earlier years, but it failed to be competitive against conventional traction and was scrapped.\n\nExamples of gas turbine-mechanical locomotives:\n\n\nA gas turbine-electric locomotive (GTEL) is a locomotive that uses a gas turbine to drive an electric generator or alternator, producing an electric current which is used to power traction motors. This type of locomotive was first experimented with during the Second World War, but reached its peak in the 1950s to 1960s. Few locomotives use this system today.\n\nA GTEL uses a turbo-electric drivetrain in which a turboshaft engine drives the electric generator or alternator via a system of gears. The electric current is distributed to power the traction motors that drive the locomotive. In overall terms the system is very similar to a conventional diesel-electric, with the large diesel engine replaced with a smaller gas turbine of similar power.\n\nUnion Pacific operated the largest fleet of such locomotives of any railroad in the world, and was the only railroad to use them for hauling freight. Most other GTELs have been built for small passenger trains, and only a few have seen any real success in that role. With a rise in fuel costs (eventually leading to the 1973 oil crisis), gas turbine locomotives became uneconomical to operate, and many were taken out of service. Union Pacific's locomotives also required more maintenance than originally anticipated, due to fouling of the turbine blades by the Bunker C oil used as fuel.\n\nIn 1939, the Swiss Federal Railways ordered a GTEL with a of maximum engine power from Brown Boveri. It was completed in 1941, and then underwent testing before entering regular service. The Am 4/6 was the world's first gas turbine-electric locomotive. It was intended primarily to work light, fast, passenger trains on routes that normally handle insufficient traffic to justify electrification.\n\nTwo gas turbine locomotives of different design, 18000 and 18100, were ordered by the Great Western Railway (GWR) but completed for the newly nationalised British Railways.\n\nBritish Rail 18000 was built by Brown Boveri and delivered in 1949. It was a 1840 kW (2470 hp) GTEL, ordered by the GWR and used for express passenger services.\n\nBritish Rail 18100 was built by Metropolitan-Vickers and delivered in 1951. It had an aircraft-type gas turbine of . Its maximum speed was .\n\nA third locomotive, the GT3, was constructed in 1961. Although built by English Electric, who had pioneered electric transmission with LMS 10000 locomotives, this used a turbine-mechanical transmission.\n\nThe British Rail APT-E, the prototype of the Advanced Passenger Train, was turbine-powered. Like the French TGV, later models used an alternative electric powertrain. This choice was made because British Leyland, the turbine supplier, ceased production of the model used in the APT-E, having lost interest in gas turbine technology following the 1970s oil crisis.\n\nALCO-GE built a prototype oil-fired gas turbine-electric locomotive in 1948, with a B-B-B-B wheel arrangement. After demonstration runs it was acquired by Union Pacific, who were seeking a more powerful alternative to diesel for transcontinental trains. \n\nUP ran a fleet of 55 turbine-powered freight locomotives starting in the early 1950s, all produced by Alco-GE. The first- and second-generation versions shared the same wheel arrangement as the prototype; the third-generation version were C-C types. All were widely used on long-haul routes, and were cost-effective despite their poor fuel economy, due to their use of \"leftover\" fuels from the petroleum industry. At their height the railroad estimated that they powered about 10% of Union Pacific's freight trains, a much wider use than any other example of this class. As other uses were found for these heavier petroleum byproducts, notably for plastics, the cost of the Bunker C fuel increased until the units became too expensive to operate and they were retired from service by 1969.\n\nIn April 1950, Baldwin and Westinghouse completed an experimental turbine locomotive, #4000, known as the \"Blue Goose\", also using the B-B-B-B wheel arrangement. The locomotive used two turbine engines, was equipped for passenger train heating with a steam generator that utilized the waste exhaust heat of the right hand turbine, and was geared for . While it was demonstrated successfully in both freight and passenger service on the PRR, MKT, and CNW, no production orders followed, and it was scrapped in 1953.\n\nIn the 1960s United Aircraft built the Turbo passenger train, which was tested by the Pennsylvania Railroad and later used by Amtrak and Via Rail. The Via remained in service into the 1980s and had an excellent maintenance record during this period, but was eventually replaced by the LRC in 1982. Amtrak purchased two different types of turbine-powered trainsets, which were both called Turboliners. The sets of the first type were similar in appearance to SNCF's T 2000 Turbotrain, though compliance with FRA safety regulations made them heavier and slower than the French trains. None of the first-type Turboliners remain in service. Amtrak also added a number of similarly named Rohr Turboliners (or RTL) to its roster. There were plans to rebuild these as RTL IIIs, but this program was cancelled. The units owned by New York State were sold for scrap and the three remaining RTL trainsets are stored at Bear and at North Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1966, the Long Island Rail Road tested an experimental gas turbine railcar (numbered \"GT-1\"), powered by two Garrett turbine engines. This car was based on a Budd Pioneer III design, with transmissions similar to Budd's 1950s-era RDCs. The car was later modified (as \"GT-2\") to add the ability to run on electric third rail as well.\n\nIn 1977, the LIRR tested eight more gas turbine-electric/electric dual mode railcars, in an experiment sponsored by the USDOT. Four of these cars had GE-designed powertrains, while the other four had powertrains designed by Garrett (four more cars had been ordered with GM/Allison powertrains, but were canceled). These cars were similar to LIRR's M1 EMU cars in appearance, with the addition of step wells for loading from low level platforms. The cars suffered from poor fuel economy and mechanical problems, and were withdrawn from service after a short period of time. The four GE-powered cars were converted to M1 EMUs and the Garrett cars were scrapped.\nIn 1997 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) solicited proposals to develop high speed locomotives for routes outside the Northeast Corridor where electrification was not economical. Bombardier Ltd, at the Plattsburg, N.Y. plant where the Acela was produced, developed a prototype (JetTrain) which combined a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 gas turbine and a diesel engine with a single gearbox powering four traction motors identical to those in Acela. The diesel provided head end power and low speed traction, with the turbine not being started until after leaving stations. The prototype was completed in June 2000, and safety testing was done at the FRA's Pueblo, CO test track beginning in the summer of 2001. A maximum speed of was reached. The prototype was then taken on a tour of potential sites for high speed service, but no service has yet begun.\n\nTwo gas turbine-electric locomotive types underwent testing in the Soviet Union. The test program began in 1959 and lasted into the early 1970s. The G1-01 freight GTEL was intended to consist of two locomotives of a C-C wheel arrangement, but only one section was built. The GP1 was a similar design, also with a C-C wheel arrangement, introduced to the test program in 1964. Two units were built, GP1-0001 and GP1-0002, which were also used in regular service. Both types had a maximum power output of .\n\nIn 2006, Russian Railways introduced the GEM-10 switcher GTEL. The turbine runs on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and has a maximum power output of . The GEM-10 has a C-C wheel arrangement. The TGEM10-0001, which uses the same turbine and fuel as the GEM-10, is a two-unit (cow-calf) sfwitcher GTEL with a wheel arrangement.\n\nThe GT1-001 freight GTEL, remade from an electric locomotive VL15 in 2006 and introduced in 2007, runs on LNG and has a maximum power output of . One section carries the LNG tank and the other houses the turbine with electric power generation, and both section have the traction motors. The locomotive has a wheel arrangement, and up to three GT1 locomotives can be coupled together. On 23 January 2009, the GT1-001 conducted a test run with a 159-car train weighing ; further heavy-haul tests were carried out in December 2010. In a test run conducted in September 2011, the locomotive pulled 170 freight cars weighing . In 2012, the helper diesel engine that used for shunting operations was replaced with an accumulator, and the locomotive was renamed to GT1h (where 'h' stands for hybrid). The GT1h-001 remained a prototype and never went into production.\n\nThe successor to the GT1h-001 is the GT1h-002. Despite the same type designation, this locomotive has a fundamentally different design with a wheel arrangement, derived from the TEM7 diesel shunting locomotive, and the new body with open LNG tank, derived from the body of the 2ES6 electric locomotive. This serial type has a maximum power output of . Both GT1h locomotives are in operation in Egorshino in the Ural region.\n\nCanadian National Railways (CN) was one of the operators of the Turbo, which were passed on to Via Rail. They operated on the major Toronto–Montreal route between 1968 and 1982, when they were replaced by the LRC.\n\nIn 2002, Bombardier Transportation announced the launch of the JetTrain, a high-speed trainset consisting of tilting carriages and a locomotive powered by a Pratt & Whitney turboshaft engine. Proposals were made to use the trains for Quebec City–Windsor, Orlando–Miami, and in Alberta, Texas, Nevada and the UK.\nOne prototype was built and tested, but no JetTrains have yet been sold for service. However, nothing ever came of any of these proposals, and the JetTrain essentially disappeared, being superseded by the Bombardier Zefiro line of conventionally powered high speed and very high speed trains. The JetTrain no longer appears on any of Bombardier's current web sites or promotional materials, although it can still be found on older web sites bearing the Canadair logos.\n\nThe first TGV prototype, TGV 001, was powered by a gas turbine, but steep oil prices prompted the change to overhead electric lines for power delivery. However, two large classes of gas-turbine powered intercity railcars were constructed in the early 1970s (ETG and RTG) and were used extensively up to about 2000.\n\nSNCF (French National Railways) used a number of gas-turbine trainsets, called the Turbotrain, in non-electrified territory. These typically consisted of a power car at each end with three cars between them. Turbotrain was in use up until 2005. After retirement, four sets were sold for further use in Iran.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s research was conducted, in both the US and UK, aimed at building gas turbine locomotives that could run on pulverized coal. The main problem was to avoid erosion of the turbine blades by particles of ash. Only one working example is known to have been produced and it was written off as a failure following testing. The sources for the following information are Robertson and Sampson.\n\nIn 1946, a Northrop-Hendy partnership launched an attempt to adapt the Northrop Turbodyne aircraft engine for locomotive use, with coal dust rather than kerosene as a fuel. In December 1946, Union Pacific donated their retired M-10002 streamliner locomotive to the project. However, the project was abandoned by the end of 1947 and there is no clear evidence that the locomotive provided for the experiment ever actually moved under gas turbine power or even had it installed. Details of the research were passed to Britain's London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Following a rise in fuel prices that was making their oil-fired GTELS uneconomic, UP experimentally revived the coal-fired gas turbine idea in the early 1960s, producing one prototype coal GTEL in October 1962. The problems with blade fouling and erosion were severe. The project was declared a failure after 20 months, during which time the locomotive ran less than 10,000 miles.\n\nOn 23 December 1952 the UK Ministry of Fuel and Power placed an order for a coal-fired gas turbine locomotive to be used on British Railways. The locomotive was to be built by the North British Locomotive Company and the turbine would be supplied by C. A. Parsons and Company.\n\nAccording to Sampson, the plan was to use indirect heating. The pulverized coal would be burned in a combustion chamber and the hot gases passed to a heat exchanger. Here, the heat would be transferred to a separate body of compressed air which would power the turbine. Essentially, it would have been a hot air engine using a turbine instead of a piston.\n\nRobertson shows a diagram that confirms Sampson's information but also refers to problems with erosion of turbine blades by ash. This is strange because, with a conventional shell and tube heat exchanger, there would be no risk of ash entering the turbine circuit.\n\nWorking cycle\n\nThere were two separate, but linked, circuits: the combustion circuit and the turbine circuit.\n\n\nSpecification\n\nThe locomotive was never built but the specification was as follows:\n\nThe projected output was:\n\nThe transmission was to be mechanical, via a two-speed gearbox, giving a high speed for passenger working and a lower speed for freight. The tractive effort figures, quoted above, look suspiciously high for the specified speeds. It seems more likely that the figures quoted are for starting tractive effort and maximum speed in high gear and low gear respectively. There is a model of the proposed locomotive at Glasgow Museum of Transport and some records are held at the National Railway Museum.\n\nThe Parsons - North British Coal Burning Gas Turbine Locomotives\nTalk at the London Science Museum 12 April 1995 by J.R.Bolter\nCopyright the Newcomen Society\n\n"}

With Bonapartism specifically referring to the case of Napoleon I of France, the term neo-Bonapartism first came to use with the rise of Louis Napoleon III. However, this is not a true example of what neo-Bonapartism has come to symbolize. M. Raoul Duval is given as example in contemporary France in a 1901 book. Neo-Bonapartism can also be used to specifically refer to movements after Napoleon I, but it need not be confined to such. The best example of Bonapartism may be Roman dictators from the Republican Period, like Julius Caesar, who attempted to quash the power of the Senate and advance the rights and welfare of the people.\n\nNeo-Bonapartist philosophy is characterized by the leader. It is believed that a strong and capable leader is necessary for the ideals the Bonapartists support - be they left or right, moderate or radical. The leader is usually a great hero of the people - in most historical cases being military in nature - who brings about reforms in their name. This philosophy by itself has never been popular, and thus is almost always used in conjunction with others. \n\nNeo-Bonapartists are often similar to enlightened despots, who use their absolute power to advance liberalism, freedoms, and social welfare, though in many cases of supposed neo-Bonapartism the exact opposite is achieved; giving rise to bastard movements more like traditional dictatorships. Nationalism is also often a component of neo-Bonapartism, though not a necessary one.\n"}

Fife Flyers and Guildford Flames were the only two teams to consistently feature in the BNL during every season of the league's history.\n\nThe league was founded in 1996 to replace the first division of the British Hockey League following the split between the two divisions of the league; the premier division having been replaced by the Ice Hockey Superleague at the same time.

Both the Capitals and the Vipers then withdrew their applications so as to let the remaining five BNL teams submit applications to join the EIHL with them. However, the terms set by the EIHL were deemed unacceptable by the other teams, and so the Capitals and the Vipers both resubmitted their own applications and were accepted into the EIHL.

{"id": "2210064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210064", "title": "Cognitive revolution", "text": "Cognitive revolution\n\nThe cognitive revolution was an intellectual movement that began in the 1950s as an interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes. It later became known collectively as cognitive science. The relevant areas of interchange were between the fields of psychology, linguistics, computer science, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy. They used approaches developed within the then-nascent fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and neuroscience. In the 1960s, the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies and the Center for Human Information Processing at the University of California San Diego were influential in developing the academic study of cognitive science. By the early 1970s, the cognitive movement had surpassed behaviorism as a psychological paradigm. Furthermore, by the early 1980s the cognitive approach had become the dominant line of research inquiry across most branches in the field of psychology.\n\nA key goal of early cognitive psychology was to apply the scientific method to the study of human cognition. Some of the main ideas and developments from the cognitive revolution were the use of the scientific method in cognitive science research, the necessity of mental systems to process sensory input, the innateness of these systems, and the modularity of the mind. Important publications in triggering the cognitive revolution include psychologist George Miller's 1956 article \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\" (one of the most frequently cited papers in psychology), linguist Noam Chomsky's \"Syntactic Structures\" (1957) and \"Review of B. F. Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior\"\" (1959), and foundational works in the field of artificial intelligence by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon, such as the 1958 article \"Elements of a Theory of Human Problem Solving\". Ulric Neisser's 1967 book \"Cognitive Psychology\" was also a landmark contribution.\n\nPrior to the cognitive revolution, behaviorism was the dominant trend in psychology in the United States. Behaviorists were interested in \"learning,\" which was seen as \"the novel association of stimuli with responses.\" Animal experiments played a significant role in behaviorist research, and prominent behaviorist J. B. Watson, interested in describing the responses of humans and animals as one group, stated that there was no need to distinguish between the two. Watson hoped to learn to predict and control behavior through his research. The popular Hull-Spence stimulus-response approach was, according to George Mandler, impossible to use to research topics that held the interest of cognitive scientists, like memory and thought, because both the stimulus and the response were thought of as completely physical events. Behaviorists typically did not research these subjects. B. F. Skinner, a functionalist behaviorist, criticized certain mental concepts like instinct as \"explanatory fiction(s),\" ideas that assume more than humans actually know about a mental concept. Various types of behaviorists had different views on the exact role (if any) that consciousness and cognition played in behavior. Although behaviorism was popular in the United States, Europe was not particularly influenced by it, and research on cognition could easily be found in Europe during this time.\n\nNoam Chomsky has framed the cognitive and behaviorist positions as rationalist and empiricist, respectively, which are philosophical positions that arose long before behaviorism became popular and the cognitive revolution occurred. Empiricists believe that human acquire knowledge only through sensory input, while rationalists believe that there is something beyond sensory experience that contributes to human knowledge. However, whether Chomsky's position on language fits into the traditional rationalist approach has been questioned by philosopher John Cottingham.\n\nGeorge Miller, one of the scientists involved in the cognitive revolution, sets the date of its beginning as September 11, 1956, when several researchers from fields like experimental psychology, computer science, and theoretical linguistics presented their work on cognitive science-related topics at a meeting of the ‘Special Interest Group in Information Theory’ at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This interdisciplinary cooperation went by several names like cognitive studies and information-processing psychology but eventually came to be known as cognitive science. Grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in the 1970s advanced interdisciplinary understanding in the relevant fields and supported the research that led to the field of cognitive neuroscience.\n\nGeorge Miller states that six fields participated in the development of cognitive science: psychology, linguistics, computer science, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy, with the first three playing the main roles.\n\nA key goal of early cognitive psychology was to apply the scientific method to the study of human cognition. This was done by designing experiments that used computational models of artificial intelligence to systematically test theories about human mental processes in a controlled laboratory setting.\n\nWhen defining the \"Cognitive Approach,\" Ulric Neisser says that humans can only interact with the \"real world\" through intermediary systems that process information like sensory input. As understood by a cognitive scientist, the study of cognition is the study of these systems and the ways they process information from the input. The processing includes not just the initial structuring and interpretation of the input but also the storage and later use.\n\nSteven Pinker claims that the cognitive revolution bridged the gap between the physical world and the world of ideas, concepts, meanings and intentions. It unified the two worlds with a theory that mental life can be explained in terms of information, computation and feedback.\n\nIn his 1975 book \"Reflections on Language\", Noam Chomsky questions how humans can know so much, despite relatively limited input. He argues that they must have some kind of innate learning mechanism that processes input, and that mechanism must be domain-specific and innate. Chomsky observes that physical organs do not develop based on their experience, but based on some inherent genetic coding, and wrote that the mind should be treated the same way. He says that there is no question that there is some kind of innate structure in the mind, but it is less agreed upon whether the same structure is used by all organisms for different types of learning. He compares humans to rats in the task of maze running to show that the same learning theory cannot be used for different species because they would be equally good at what they are learning, which is not the case. He also says that even within humans, using the same learning theory for multiple types of learning could be possible, but there is no solid evidence to suggest it. He proposes a hypothesis that claims that there is a biologically based language faculty that organizes the linguistic information in the input and constrains human language to a set of particular types of grammars. He introduces universal grammar, a set of inherent rules and principles that all humans have to govern language, and says that the components of universal grammar are biological. To support this, he points out that children seem to know that language has a hierarchical structure, and they never make mistakes that one would expect from a hypothesis that language is linear.\n\nSteven Pinker has also written on this subject from the perspective of modern-day cognitive science. He says that modern cognitive scientists, like figures in the past such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), don’t believe in the idea of the mind starting a \"blank slate.\" Though they have disputes on the nature-nurture diffusion, they all believe that learning is based on something innate to humans. Without this innateness, there will be no learning process. He points out that humans' acts are non-exhaustive, even though basic biological functions are finite. An example of this from linguistics is the fact that humans can produce infinite sentences, most of which are brand new to the speaker themselves, even though the words and phrases they have heard are not infinite.\n\nPinker, who agrees with Chomsky's idea of innate universal grammar, claims that although humans speak around six thousand mutually unintelligible languages, the grammatical programs in their minds differ far less than the actual speech. Many different languages can be used to convey the same concepts or ideas, which suggests there may be a common ground for all the languages.\n\nPinker claims another important idea from the cognitive revolution was that the mind is modular, with many parts cooperating to generate a train of thought or an organized action. It has different distinct systems for different specific missions. Behaviors can vary across cultures, but the mental programs that generate the behaviors don’t need to be varied.\n\nThere have been criticisms of the typical characterization of the shift from behaviorism to cognitivism.\n\nHenry L. Roediger III argues that the common narrative most people believe about the cognitive revolution is inaccurate. The narrative he describes states that psychology started out well but lost its way and fell into behaviorism, but this was corrected by the Cognitive Revolution, which essentially put an end to behaviorism. He claims that behavior analysis is actually still an active area of research that produces successful results in psychology and points to the Association for Behavior Analysis International as evidence. He claims that behaviorist research is responsible for successful treatments of autism, stuttering, and aphasia, and that most psychologists actually study observable behavior, even if they interpret their results cognitively. He believes that the change from behaviorism to cognitivism was gradual, slowly evolving by building on behaviorism.\n\nLachman and Butterfield were among the first to imply that cognitive psychology has a revolutionary origin. Thomas H. Leahey has criticized the idea that the introduction of behaviorism and the cognitive revolution were actually revolutions and proposed an alternative history of American psychology as \"a narrative of research traditions.\"\n\nJerome Bruner criticized the view that there was a conflict between behaviorism and the study of mental events, and he characterized one of the primary objects of the cognitive revolution as changing the study of psychology so that meaning was its core. His understanding of the cognitive revolution revolves entirely around \"meaning-making\" and the formal description of how people go about this. He believes that the cognitive revolution steered psychology away from behaviorism by taking a very different path, rather than by modifying behaviorism with mentalism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The island is located off the coast of Iran and northwest of the Strait of Hormuz. Administered by the adjacent coastal Bushehr Province, Kharg Island provides a sea port for the export of oil and extends Iranian territorial sea claims into the Persian Gulf oil fields. Located on Kharg Island is Kharg, the only city in the Kharg District.\n\nMentioned in the Hudud al-'Alam as a good source for pearls around 982 AD, Kharg was visited by Jean de Thévenot in 1665, who recorded trade at the time with Isfahan and Basra. In 1753 the Dutch Empire established both a trading post and a fort on the island after securing perpetual ownership of the island from Mir Nasáir, the Arab ruler of Bandar Rig, in return for a present of 2000 rupees. In 1766 the Dutch fort was captured by Mir Mahanna, the governor of Bandar Rig.\n\nThe island was briefly occupied in 1838 by the British to block the Siege of Herat (1838) but was soon returned. Amoco built and operated the oil terminal on the island. Its property was expropriated after the revolution.\n\nOnce the world's largest offshore crude oil terminal and the principal sea terminal for Iranian oil, the Kharg Island facilities were put out of commission in the fall of 1986. Heavy bombing of the Kharg Island facilities from 1980 through 1988 by the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran–Iraq War all but destroyed most of the terminal facilities. Kharg Island was situated in the middle of the Darius Oilfield, also destroyed by the intensive bombing. Repair to all facilities has been very slow, even after the war ended in 1988. The events experienced by this island gave rise to the dispute in the English contract law case \"The Kanchenjunga\" [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 391, regarding the conditions for repudiatory breach of contract and a claimant's right to elect to accept repudiation.\n\nIn 2009, Iran exported and swapped 950 million barrels of crude oil via southern Kharg oil terminal.\n\nThe first archaeological evidence of human occupation on Kharg island was reported by Captain A. W. Stiffe in 1898, with studies published about his discoveries by F. Sarre and E. Herzfeld in 1910. They discovered two rock-cut chambered tombs featuring arched entranceways to a main chamber with vestibule from which spawned around twenty smaller chambers. The southern tomb is deep and features a relief of a reclining man drinking in the Selucid and Parthian styles of Palmyra along with a damaged relief suggested to feature Nike on the face of a sphere-topped column. Mary-Joseph Steve has argued that the architecture of the tombs is more reminiscent of Nabataean architecture at Petra than anything Palmyrene.\n\nAnother Eighty three rock cut tombs and sixty two megalithic tombs have been studied on Kharg. The rock-cut tombs fall into four categories; single chambered, shallow tombs of varying shape, pit burials and excavated multi-chambered complexes. Steve also noticed the presence of several Nestorian style crosses at some of the tombs.\n\nThere are also ruins of a coarse stone temple on the island measuring around square with a plastered altar for fire in the centre.\n\nA Christian church complex or ancient monastery of some by is also located on the island featuring a chapel, nineteen monks cells, library and courtyard.\n\nOn November 14, 2007, a cuneiform inscription dating back to Achaemenid era was discovered on Kharg Island in Old Persian. The inscription is carved on a coral rock in Old Persian semi-syllabic cuneiform signs. Despite the usually well-ordered regular system of Achaemenid inscriptions, this one is in an unusual order written in five lines.\n\nOn May 31, 2008, the inscription was seriously damaged by unknown vandal(s). They destroyed it with a sharp object, such that about 70 percent of the inscription was seriously damaged. The nature of the damage indicates that it was done deliberately.\n\nJean de Thévenot noted the presences of qanats on the island that would have provided ancient irrigation.\n\nThe island appears with a SAM radar installation on it in the Sega Genesis flight simulator F-15 Strike Eagle II in the Persian Gulf mission map.\n\nThe island is featured as a playable map in DICE's \"Battlefield 3\" video game, having some resemblance to the real island.\n\nIt also appears in \"\".\n\n\n"}

The geographic area is located in the portion of the Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania ZIP code that comprises Rosemont. The community is (roughly) bounded by Lancaster Avenue, Conestoga Road, Garrett Avenue and Lowrys Lane. Although a strong working class community with blue collar roots, it is located on the Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line. \n\nThe community is served by its own stop, Garrett Hill station, on the Norristown High Speed Line, formerly the Philadelphia and Western Railway.\n\nGarrett Hill is mainly a residential community, but also includes a small commercial area (near the intersection of Conestoga Road and Garrett Avenue) consisting of a few bars and other small businesses that serve the community and the student population of nearby Villanova University.\n\nOne of Garrett Hill's traditions is an annual community Fourth of July parade, followed by a free picnic with live music and other entertainment in Clem Macrone Park.\n\nGarrett Hill's housing stock consists largely of late 19th-century and early-to-mid 20th-century structures, including Victorian, single-family frame and brick duplex homes.\n\nThe 253 acres that make up the heart of Garrett Hill was originally settled by the family of David James and Margaret Mortimer of Llandegley and Glascwm Parises of Radnorshire, Wales who arrived in Pennsylvania on October 28, 1682 on board the sailing ship Bristol Factor that was captained by Roger Drew. The Bristol Factor was one of approximately 32 vessels chartered by William Penn between 1681 and 1684 to ferry the Welsh Quakers from various parts of Wales across the Atlantic to Pennsylvania for the purpose of establishing a Welsh Barony for Sir William Penn. In 1682 Garrett Hill lay in the heart of what was then known as The Welsh Tract. Radnor Township acquired its name because many of the settlers, such as the James family had come directly from Radnorshire, Wales.\n\nWhen the James family arrived in the Fall of 1682, they proceeded to present day Garrett Hill using dead reckoning for the area at that time was still wilderness. David James had acquired \"rights\" to 100 acres where Garrett Hill stands today when he purchased an \"indenture\" to land in Welshpoole, Wales in the summer of 1682. The James family were literally the first inhabitants of Garrett Hill. They spent their first winter 1682-1683 living in a cave near present-day Radnor United Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1718 the James family acquired the rights to an additional 153 acres of Garrett Hill from David Meredith who, although had not previously occupied the land, had been declared lord over the land in 1708 by William Penn's land commissioners. 1n 1739, David James, the founder of Garrett Hill died and was buried in the cemetery that surrounds the Great Valley Baptist Church in Devon. His tombstone can be found there today.\n\nIn 1776, two of David James' grandsons, Daniel James and Elias James, would serve on the Continental Line under General George Washington in the Revolutionary War. During the Revolutionary War, the James Family Plantation would be raided and occupied by the British Army stripping the family farm of all its assets including food, livestock and household supplies as punishment for the family's service to the rebels.\n\nIn 1780 local Methodists began meeting and studying at the James family plantation home, called the Old James Mansion. Three years later, in 1783 David James' son, Evan James, would donate a half-acre of land memorializing where the family landed in 1682 to the Radnor United Methodist Church. Thereafter, the area acquired the name \"Methodist Hill.\" Prior to that the area had been known as \"James Hill.\" \n\nNot until the advent of the stone quarry and brickyard did Garrett Hill acquire the name by which it is known today. Once the area was industrialized a community sprung up consisting of residences for workers in close proximity to the nearby stone quarry and brickyard (now both disappeared). The residents also worked at the estates which were common in the area.\n\n"}

However, Gibsons arrest for drunk driving and subsequent legal issues shelved any plans for a movie based on the book.\n\nWilliam Queen was a nearly 20-year ATF veteran as well as a motorcycle enthusiast when, in 1998, a \"confidential informant\" contacted Queen's superiors, offering to help place an agent inside the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols. Queen's work was soon to become the most extensive undercover operation into a motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement.\n\nQueen, using the alias Billy St. John, successfully infiltrated the gang by posing as a heavily bearded and long-haired motorcyclist who liked to drink beer and ride his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. After becoming a full member (\"patched\"), Queen eventually rose to the office of Treasurer in the organization. As Treasurer, he had access to evidence of the gang's criminal activity and was able to build a case against dozens of Mongol club members. Initially, Queen was subjected by members to tests of his fealty by taking part in and witnessing the trafficking of drugs and firearms and the theft of motorcycles, as well as driving getaway cars.\n\nIn the book Queen details how, after 28 months, he began to lose his own identity to his new persona. He explained how he learned to battle the conflicts both within the gang and within himself in order to keep his identity a secret.

When the work began to have the effect of isolating Queen, he explains in the book, the Mongols began to feel like his own family, causing emotional difficulty for him when the investigation closed more than two years after it had begun.\n"}
{"id": "2210111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210111", "title": "Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution", "text": "Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nA convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also called an Article V Convention or amendments convention, called for by two-thirds (currently 34) of the state legislatures, is one of two processes authorized by Article Five of the United States Constitution whereby the United States Constitution may be altered. Amendments may also be proposed by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nTo become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by either—as determined by Congress—the legislatures of three-fourths (presently 38) of the states, or state ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states. Thirty-three amendments to the United States Constitution have been approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Twenty-seven of these amendments have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution. , the amendment convention process has never been used for proposing constitutional amendments.\n\nWhile there have been calls for an \"Article V Convention\" based on a single issue such as the balanced budget amendment, it is not clear whether a convention summoned in this way would be legally bound to limit discussion to a single issue; law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen has suggested that such a convention would have the \"power to propose anything it sees fit\", whereas law professor Michael Rappaport and attorney-at-law Robert Kelly believe that a limited convention is possible.\n\nIn recent years, some have argued that state governments should call for such a convention. They include Michael Farris, Lawrence Lessig, Sanford Levinson, Larry Sabato, Jonathan Turley, Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro, and Greg Abbott. In 2015, Citizens for Self-Governance launched a nationwide effort to call an Article V Convention, through a project called Convention of the States, in a bid to rein in the federal government. , CSG's resolution has passed in 15 states. Similarly, the group Wolf PAC chose this method to promote its cause, which is to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"Citizens United v. FEC\". Their resolution has passed in five states.\n\nEight state constitutions in effect at the time of the 1787 Constitutional Convention convened in Philadelphia included an amendment mechanism. Amendment-making power rested with the legislature in three of the states and in the other five it was given to specially elected conventions. The Articles of Confederation provided that amendments were to be proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all thirteen state legislatures. This was seen by the Federalists as a major flaw in the Articles, as it created a nearly insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform. The amendment process crafted during the Constitutional Convention, James Madison later wrote in The Federalist No. 43, was designed to establish a balance between pliancy and rigidity:\n\nOne of the main reasons for the 1787 Convention was that the Articles of Confederation required the unanimous consent of all 13 states for the national government to take action. This system had proved unworkable, and the newly written Constitution sought to address this problem.\n\nThe first proposal for a method of amending the Constitution offered in the Constitutional Convention, contained in the Virginia Plan, sought to circumvent the national legislature, stating that \"the assent of the National Legislature ought not to be required.\" This was subsequently modified by the Committee of Detail to include a process whereby Congress would call for a constitutional convention on the request of two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nDuring the debate on the Committee of Detail's report, James Madison expressed concern about the lack of detail in the article regarding how the convention amendment process would work, stating that \"difficulties might arise as to the form\" a convention would take. He later proposed removing reference to the convention amendment process, thus giving the national legislature sole authority to propose amendments whenever it thought necessary or when two-thirds of the states applied to the national legislature. Several delegates voiced opposition to the idea of the national legislature retaining sole power to propose constitutional amendments. George Mason argued from the floor of the Convention that it \"would be improper to require the consent of the National Legislature, because they may abuse their power, and refuse their consent on that very account.\" Mason added that, \"no amendments of the proper kind would ever be obtained by the people, if the Government should become oppressive.\" In response to these concerns, the Convention unanimously voted to add the language allowing states to apply to Congress for a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution.\n\nA frequent question is whether applications from the states can omit to mention subject matter, and instead request an unlimited convention. Past practice suggests that separate unlimited applications submitted to Congress at different times are not allowed. Article V itself calls for \"the application of the legislatures\" instead of calling for plural \"applications\".\n\nStates have requested that Congress convene an Article V convention to propose amendments on a variety of subjects. According to the National Archives, Congress has, however, never officially tabulated the applications, nor separated them by subject matter. On at least one occasion though, the \"Congressional Record\" has included such a tabulation, which indicated that, , thirty states had made a request for a balanced budget amendment. In 1993, professor Michael Paulsen and his research staff assembled a listing of all state applications to date, but neither Paulsen's list, nor any other, can be safely characterized as \"complete\" since there may very well be state applications that have been overlooked and/or forgotten.\n\nAccording to James Kenneth Rogers, a corporate liability attorney, the drafting history of Article V indicates that states may limit the subject matter of their applications, and that Congress has a duty to tally applications separately by subject matter. Moreover, Rogers asserts that states may \"not\" make a general application without specifying the subject or subjects to be addressed by the convention. Rogers points out that, during the drafting process, the Philadelphia Convention at one point adopted a version of Article V that gave power to Congress to propose amendments when two-thirds of both houses agreed, or to propose amendments without a congressional supermajority \"on the application of two thirds of the Legislatures of the several states.\" This draft version of Article V lacked any provision for a constitutional convention requested by the states, and instead included language almost identical to the final version of Article V but giving states the power to apply to Congress for amendments without any convention. The draft language suggests that states applying to Congress for amendments would have to say what sort of amendments they were applying for, because a general petition (that is, one not limited by subject matter) asking Congress to propose amendments would serve little purpose \"beyond notifying Congress that two‐thirds of the States thought that some unknown changes to the Constitution were desirable.\" Therefore, due to the similarity between the draft and final versions, Rogers contends that state applications to Congress must specify subject matter, and must be tallied individually by subject matter to determine whether the two-thirds threshold of state applications has been met.\n\nThere has been a spectrum of debate, however, with some dissent of Rogers' view posed by Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law who also serves as an attorney consultant for, among other things, Constitutional Issues of Religious Liberty, Free Speech, and other Matters. In two law review articles in 1993 and again in 2011, Paulsen argued that state applications for an Article V convention limited to a particular subject matter are invalid and that only applications that include a call for an unrestricted convention are valid. If Paulsen's criteria that state applications must not be limited to particular subject matter and that a rescission by states are valid, then forty-five applications from states were active as of 1993. Paulsen argues that Congress has had ample direction to call a convention on these grounds.\n\nThere has been no definitive determination by the Supreme Court regarding the state convention amendment method, though it has handled several cases and an array of arguments on the scope which Amendments can ultimately affect. The 1939 case Coleman v. Miller, which questioned whether a state legislature could relinquish endorsement of an Amendment pertaining to child labor, decided in part, \"the question whether a reasonable time had elapsed since submission of the proposal was a nonjusticiable political question, the kinds of considerations entering into deciding being fit for Congress to evaluate, and the question of the effect of a previous rejection upon a ratification was similarly nonjusticiable, because the 1868 Fourteenth Amendment precedent of congressional determination 'has been accepted.'\" The case is seen to stand as authority for the proposition that at least some decisions with respect to the proposal and ratifications of constitutional amendments are exclusively within the purview of Congress, either because they are textually committed to Congress or because the courts lack adequate criteria of determination to pass on them.\n\nBecause no Article V convention has ever been convened, there are various questions about how such a convention would function in practice. One major question is whether the scope of the convention's subject matter could be limited.\n\nThe language of Article V leaves no discretion to Congress, merely stating that Congress \"shall\" call a convention when the proper number of state applications have been received. Comments made at the time the Constitution was adopted indicate that it was understood when the Constitution was drafted that Congress would have no discretion. In \"The Federalist\", Alexander Hamilton stated that when the proper number of applications had been received, Congress was \"obliged\" to call a convention and that \"nothing is left to the discretion of Congress.\" James Madison also affirmed Hamilton's contention that Congress was obligated to call a convention when the requisite number of states requested it. In the North Carolina debates about ratifying the Constitution, James Iredell, who subsequently became one of the founding members of the Supreme Court, stated that when two-thirds of states have applied to Congress for a convention, Congress is \"under the necessity of convening one\" and that they have \"no option.\"\n\nBy citing the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress has tried to enact a statute to regulate how an Article V convention would function. Sponsored by the late Senator Sam Ervin, such a bill passed the U.S. Senate unanimously in 1971 and again in 1973, but the proposed legislation remained bottled up in the Committee on the Judiciary in the U.S. House of Representatives and died both times. Senator Orrin Hatch made a similar proposal several times in the late 1980s culminating in 1991 with no more success. Opponents to congressional regulation of an Article V convention's operations argue that neither Article I nor Article V of the Constitution grants Congress this power, and that the Founders intended that Congress \"have no option.\" There has been no opportunity for federal courts to decide whether Congress has such authority because such legislation has never been adopted by Congress.\n\nSome scholars believe that states have the power to limit the scope of an Article V convention. Larry Sabato is one scholar who advanced that view. Some feel that Congress's duty to call a convention when requested by the states means that it must call the convention that the states requested. If the states, therefore, request a convention limited to a certain subject matter, then the convention that is called would likely need to be limited in the way the states requested.\n\nIf states have the power to limit an Article V convention to a particular subject matter, and Congress only has power to call a convention but no further power to control or regulate it, then a potential concern becomes whether an Article V convention could become a \"runaway convention\" that attempts to exceed its scope. If a convention did attempt to exceed its scope, none of the amendments it proposed would become part of the constitution until three-fourths of the states ratified them, which is more states than are required to call a convention in the first place. Some proponents of a convention express doubt that an Article V convention would exceed its scope, in light of the United States' experience with state constitutional conventions; over 600 state constitutional conventions have been held to amend state constitutions, with little evidence that any of them have exceeded their scope. This is reinforced by the fact that prior to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, there were many other conventions of the states (some called by Congress, but most called by the states themselves) where the delegates operated within the scope of their commissions.\n\nFurther, at many Conventions, States have directly controlled their delegates. In the New Hampshire Convention to ratify the U.S. Constitution, delegates were sent with instructions to vote against the Constitution. When they were convinced that the voters had been mistaken, the delegates returned to their constituents to convince them and request new instructions, allowing the Convention to represent the true voice of the people. Similarly, in the 1787 Convention, two of New York's delegates left in protest. The New York State Legislature had created a rule that required two delegates to agree to cast a vote on behalf of the state. The legislature opted not to send new delegates and so Alexander Hamilton accepted the authority of the state and was unable to cast a vote for the remainder of the Convention. This is the fundamental difference between a Delegate to a Convention, there to do the bidding of their constituents, and a Representative to a Legislature, there to stand in place of their constituents and make decisions based on their own deliberation.\n\nThe delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention did disregard Congress's recommendation to \"solely amend the Articles\" but as Madison noted in Federalist No. 40, the resolution Congress passed in February 1787 endorsing the Convention was only a recommendation. Regardless, the delegates sent nothing to the States at all, sending their new Constitution to Congress, as was their mandate. Congress debated the matter before voting to send it on to the States for ratification with no recommendation for or against.\n\nThe legislatures of some states have adopted rescissions of their prior applications. It is not clear from the language of Article V whether a subsequent vote to rescind an application is permissible. As discussed above, however, if the purpose of Article V is to give state legislatures power over a recalcitrant Congress—and if state lawmakers may indeed limit their applications by specific subject matter—it is possible that federal courts would hold that rescissions of previous applications are likewise valid, in order to give more meaningful effect to the power which Article V confers upon state legislators.\n\nIf it is ultimately adjudicated that a state may \"not\" rescind a prior application, then Ohio's 2013 application for a balanced budget amendment convention would be the 33rd and Michigan's 2014 application would be the 34th (out of the necessary 34) on that topic, rather than the 20th and 22nd, respectively. The balanced budget amendment applications by Ohio and Michigan were new, first-time convention applications, whereas the renewed applications from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Utah simply reprised applications made by those states during the 1970s but which had been rescinded during the period between 1988 and 2010.\n\nThose arguing that rescission is impossible often also argue that you can combine different topics. Congress has more than enough applications on a single issue if you do not count rescission and more than enough applications on multiple topics if you do count rescission. Consequently, if a State believes that combining topics could be done by Congress, even if a State feels that doing so would be contrary to the intent of the Constitution, then they would also have to conclude that Congress can ignore rescission, making an effort to rescind an Article V Convention for a topic with which a legislature agrees a fruitless prospect.\n\nSince 2016, four state legislatures (Delaware, New Mexico, Maryland, and Nevada) have rescinded their applications to call for an Article V convention to enact a federal balanced budget amendment.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has never definitively interpreted the meaning of Article V, it has, on four separate occasions, referred to the Article V convention process:\n\n\"Dodge v. Woolsey\", 59 U.S. 331 (1855): \"[The people] have directed that amendments should be made representatively for them, by the Congress ...; or where the legislatures of two thirds of the several States shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the constitution, when ratified ...\"\n\n\"Hawke v. Smith\", : V] makes provision for the proposal of amendments either by two-thirds of both houses of Congress or on application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states, thus securing deliberation and consideration before any change can be proposed. The proposed change can only become effective by the ratification of the legislatures of three-fourths of the states or by conventions in a like number of states. The method of ratification is left to the choice of Congress.\"\n\n\"Dillon v. Gloss\" : In a ruling upholding Congress's authority to place a deadline on a particular Constitutional amendment's ratification, the Court reaffirmed that \"A further mode of proposal—as yet never invoked—is provided, which is that, on the application of two-thirds of the states, Congress shall call a convention for the purpose.\"\n\n\"United States v. Sprague\", 282 U.S. 716 (1931): \"[A]rticle 5 is clear in statement and in meaning, contains no ambiguity and calls for no resort to rules of construction. ... It provides two methods for proposing amendments. Congress may propose them by a vote of two-thirds of both houses, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the States, must call a convention to propose them.\"\n\nBecause of the political question doctrine and the Court's ruling in the 1939 case of \"Coleman v. Miller\" (307 U.S. 433), it remains an open question whether federal courts could assert jurisdiction over a legal challenge to Congress, if Congress were to refuse to call a convention.\n\nEvery state except Hawaii has applied for an Article V Convention at one time or another. The majority of such applications were made in the 20th century. Before any official count had been taken, one private count puts the total number of applications at over 700. This is widely considered an overestimate. The House of Representatives is in the process of building its own official count which currently stands at over 120 with 35 states having current live calls that have not been rescinded. This is an underestimate as it so far does not include anything before the 1960s and there are many known Convention calls not yet included. Both Wolf PAC and the Convention of the States estimate, based on spot checking, that the real figure is in the range of 400 calls.\n\nEven though the Article V Convention process has never been used to amend the Constitution, the number of states applying for a convention has nearly reached the required threshold several times. Congress has proposed amendments to the Constitution on several occasions, at least in part, because of the threat of an Article V Convention. Rather than risk such a convention taking control of the amendment process away from it, Congress acted pre-emptively to propose the amendments instead. The Bill of Rights, which includes the first ten amendments, as well as the Twenty-seventh Amendment, were proposed in part because of a Convention application by the New York and Virginia legislatures at the suggestion of a letter from the New York State Convention to ratify the Constitution. The Convention would have been limited to those changes discussed at the various State ratifying Conventions. At least four other amendments (the Seventeenth, Twenty-First, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments) have been identified as being proposed by Congress at least partly in response to the threat of an Article V convention, bringing the total to 15 out of 27, a majority of the Amendments.\n\nIn the late 1890s, the House of Representatives passed multiple resolutions for a constitutional amendment providing for direct election of senators. The Senate refused to consider those resolutions. In 1893, Nebraska filed the first Article V application for direct election of senators. By 1911, 29 states had Article V convention applications on file for an amendment providing for direct election of senators, just two short of the 31-state threshold. As new states were being added the threshold increased, however those States had already passed resolutions supporting such a Convention. The final count is somewhat uncertain, but when either one or two further states were required the Senate finally conceded and passed its version of an amendment in May 1911, which was then approved by the House in 1912 and submitted to the states.\n\nThere have been two nearly successful attempts to amend the Constitution via an Article V Convention since the late 1960s. The first try was an attempt to propose an amendment that would overturn two Supreme Court decisions, \"Wesberry v. Sanders\" and \"Reynolds v. Sims\", decisions that required states to adhere to the one man, one vote principle in drawing electoral districts for state and federal elections. The attempt fell only one state short of reaching the 34 needed to force Congress to call a convention in 1969, but ended by the death of its main promoter Senator Everett Dirksen. After this peak, several states (whose legislatures by this point had been re-engineered in the wake of the rulings) rescinded their applications, and interest in the proposed amendment subsided.\n\nIn response to increasing federal deficits, a movement in the 1970s by the states to impose fiscal discipline on the federal government began. Between 1975 and 1979, thirty states petitioned Congress for a convention to write a balanced budget amendment. By 1983, the number of applications had reached 32, only two states short of the 34 needed to force such a convention. In addition, at least four states (California, Illinois, Kentucky, and Montana) had adopted resolutions requesting that Congress propose a deficit spending amendment. California and Montana were set to hold ballot initiatives that would have forced their legislatures to file convention applications, but state courts ruled the two ballot initiatives unconstitutional, and the effort stalled. Enthusiasm for the amendment subsided in response to fears that an Article V Convention could not be limited to a single subject and because Congress passed the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act in 1985 (The act was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1986 but Congress enacted a reworked version of the law in 1987). By 1989, two states (Alabama and Florida) had rescinded their applications. Similar recisions\nwere passed in Nevada (1989), Louisiana (1991), Colorado (1992), Oregon (1999), Idaho (2000), Utah, (2001), North Dakota (2001) Wyoming (2001), Arizona (2003) and Georgia (2004).\n\nRecently the movement has seen a revival. On November 20, 2013, the Ohio General Assembly applied to Congress for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment. This effort made Ohio the 20th state to join a push for a national convention of states. On March 26, 2014, the Michigan Legislature applied to Congress for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment, making Michigan the 22nd to participate in the national effort. On April 27, 2016, the Oklahoma Senate approved an Article V convention on a balanced budget amendment, making Oklahoma the 29th state to participate in the national effort. On November 7, 2017, the Wisconsin Legislature approved an Article V convention resolution for a balanced budget amendment.\n\nA political action committee called Wolf PAC emerged from New York's Occupy Wall Street movement in October 2011. Wolf PAC calls for a convention of states in order to propose a constitutional amendment that addresses the issue of campaign finance. The resolution reads \"\"Corporations are not people. They have none of the Constitutional rights of human beings. Corporations are not allowed to give money to any politician, directly or indirectly. No politician can raise over $100 from any person or entity. All elections must be publicly financed.\"\"\n\n, Wolf PAC's application had been passed in five states: Vermont, Illinois, California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey.\n\nThe conservative group Citizens for Self-Governance (CSG) is engaged in an ongoing effort to call an Article V Convention. Through its \"Convention of States Project\", CSG is seeking \"to urge and empower state legislators to call a convention of states.\" CSG states that it initiated the Convention of States project \"for the purpose of stopping the runaway power of the federal government.\" Mark Levin has supported CSG's efforts to a call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the constitution.\n\nIn December 2013, nearly 100 legislators from 32 states met at Mount Vernon to talk about how to call a convention of states. According to \"Slate\", \"The meeting lasted four hours, ending when legislators agreed to meet again in the spring of 2014. That’s the most progress anyone’s made in decades toward a states-first constitutional amendment campaign.\"\n\nIn February 2014, U.S. Senator Tom Coburn announced that after his retirement from Congress, he would focus on promoting the Convention of States to state legislatures. In December 2015, Marco Rubio endorsed CSG's efforts to a call an Article V Convention. In January 2016, Texas Governor Greg Abbott called for a Convention of States to restrict the power of the federal government. In June 2017, former U.S. Senator and former Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint announced his role as a senior adviser for the Convention of States project.\n\nIn September 2016, CSG held a simulated convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution in Williamsburg, Virginia. An assembly of 137 delegates representing every state gathered to conduct a simulated convention. The simulated convention passed amendments relating to six topics, including requiring the states to approve any increase in the national debt, imposing term limits, restricting the scope of the Commerce Clause, limiting the power of federal regulations, requiring a supermajority to impose federal taxes and repealing the 16th Amendment, and giving the states the power to abrogate any federal law, regulation, or executive order.\n\n, CSG's application for a Convention of States has been passed in 15 states.\n\nA Super PAC called Single Subject Amendment registered with the Federal Election Commission on March 1, 2013. It is actively engaged in an effort to call an Article V Convention for the limited purpose of proposing an amendment to provide every law enacted by Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be clearly expressed in the bill's title. Forty-one state constitutions have a single subject provision but this provision is not in the United States Constitution. In April 2014, Florida became the first state to make an application for an Article V Convention to constitutionally prohibit unrelated riders in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Penelope mentions the Taphian sea-robbers when she rebukes the chief of her suitors, and it is disguised as Mentes, \"lord of the Taphian men who love their oars\", that Athena accepts the hospitality of Telemachus and speeds him on his journey from Ithaca to Pylos. The Taphians dealt in slaves.\n\nBy the time of Euripides, the islands were identified with the Echinades: in Euripedes' \"Iphigeneia at Aulis\" (405 BCE), the chorus of women from Chalcis have spied the Hellenes' fleet and seen Eurytus who \"led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land.\" Modern scholars, such as the editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, identify the island of Taphos as the island of Meganisi just east of the larger island Lefkada (Leucas).\n\nThe Taphians accounted themselves the descendants of Perseus, for the mother of Taphius, their eponymous colonizer, was a granddaughter of Perseus and lay with Poseidon to beget the heroic founder. Another tradition holds that Taphius was one of the Leleges, and grandson of Lelex. Their most noted king was Pterelaos, rendered immortal by Poseidon by the single golden hair among the hairs of his head, but undone by his faithless daughter (Comaetho) who plucked it while he slept, so that the Mycenaean adventurer Amphitryon of Tiryns could overcome and kill him and retrieve the cattle Pterelaos' sons had rustled from Mycenae, with much spoils besides. As he was returning with his spoils to his bride at Thebes, Zeus preceded him by one night: taking Amphitryon's shape, and brandishing a Taphian cup as a sign of his success, the king of gods fathered Heracles.\n\nThey are often identified with the Tilevoides (Τηλεβόιδες), islands in the Ionian Sea.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210144", "title": "Echinades", "text": "Echinades\n\nThe Echinades (; Greek: per Herodotus, Thucydides, and Strabo, per Homer Echinae (, ) are a group of islands in the Ionian Sea, off the coast of Acarnania, Greece. The archipelago is commonly subdivided into three groups: the Drakoneres in the north, the Modia in the middle and the Ouniades in the south. Administratively, the Echinades form part of two regional units: Ithaca and Cephalonia. Six of the islands, including Oxeia the largest, are owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, who purchased them for a reported £7.3 million sterling. The Battle of the Echinades in 1427 and the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 were fought at or near the islands.\n\nSeveral of the islands have been joined to the mainland by alluvial deposits. Herodotus says that half of the islands had been already united to the mainland in his time (ii. 10); and Thucydides expected that this would be the case with all of them before long, since they lay so close together as to be easily connected by the alluvium brought down by the Achelous River (ii. 102.). This expectation, however, has not been fulfilled, which Pausanias attributed (viii. 24. § 11) to the Achelous bringing down less alluvium in consequence of the uncultivated condition of Aetolia; but there can be little doubt that it is owing to the increasing depth of the sea, which prevents any perceptible progress being made.\n\nThe Echinades are mentioned by Homer, who, in the Iliad, says that Meges, son of Phyleus, led 40 ships to Troy from Dulichium and the sacred islands Echinae, which are situated beyond the sea, opposite Elis. Phyleus was the son of Augeas, king of the Epeians in Elis, who emigrated to Dulichium because he had incurred his father's anger. In the Odyssey, Dulichium (which may be an island in the Echniades) is frequently mentioned along with Same (Kefalonia), Zacynthus, and Ithaca as one of the islands subject to Ulysses, and is celebrated for its fertility. Strabo, and most modern writers, place Dulichium among the Echinades, most identifying it with the island of Makri. Euripides (in \"Iphigeneia at Aulis\") identifies the Echinades with the islands of Taphos (Taphiae Insulae). However, most modern scholars, including the editors of the \"Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World\", place the island of Taphos at Meganisi east of Lefkada, quite northwest of the Echinades; hence, the islands of Taphos would include Meganisi, Kalamos, Kastos, and surrounding islands.\n\nHomer, as we have already seen, describes the Echinades as inhabited; but both Thucydides and Scylax represent them as deserted. Strabo simply says that they were barren and rugged (x. p. 458). Stephanus of Byzantium names a town Apollonia situated in one of the islands (s. v. ). Pliny the Elder gives us the names of nine of these islands — Aegialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Geoaris, Dionysia, Cyrnus, Chalcis, Pinara, Mystus. Another of the Echinades was Artemita (), which became united to the mainland. Artemidorus spoke of Artemita as a peninsula near the mouth of the Achelous, and Rhianus connected it with the Oxeiae (Oxeias, Oxiés, or Scrofés) islands. (Steph. B. s. v. ) The Oxeiae () are sometimes spoken of as a separate group of islands to the west or south of the Echinades, but are included by Strabo under the general name of Echinades (x. p. 458). The Oxeiae, according to Strabo, are mentioned by Homer under the synonymous name of Thoae or Thoai.\n\nThe Echinades derived their name from the \"echinus\" or the sea urchin, in consequence of their sharp and prickly outlines. For the same reason they were called Oxeiae, or the Sharp Islands, a name which one of them still retains under the slightly altered form of Oxeia (Oxiés, Oxiá, or Oxia). Leake remarks that the Echinades are divided into two clusters, besides Petalas (Petalá), which, being, quite barren and close to the mainland, is not claimed, or at least is not occupied by the Ithacans, though anciently it was undoubtedly one of the Echinades. The northern cluster is commonly called the Drakoneres, from Drakonera, the principal island; and the southern, the Ouniades or Oxeiae. By the Venetians they were known as the islands of Kurtzolári, which name belongs properly to a peninsula to the left of the mouth of the Achelous, near Oxeia. Seventeen of the islands have names, besides the four Modia (Stamodio or Módi Islands), two of which are mere rocks, and nine of the seventeen are cultivated. These are, beginning from the south — Oxeia (Oxiá), Makri (Makrí), Vrómonas (Vromotas or Vrómona), Pontikos (Pondikónisi), Karlonísi (Karlónísi), Prováti, Lampriní (Lambrinó), Sofía (Sofiá), also known as Gaia, Drakonera (Dhragonára). Oxeia alone is lofty (421 meters). Makri and Vrómonas are the two islands next in importance.\n\n\n"}

The album was released on October 28, 2003 via Razor & Tie Records. Two singles were released from the album in \"Self Medicate\" and \"Taxi Cab Confession\".\n\nDuring promotion of the album, 40 Below Summer appeared on \"Headbangers Ball\", and the video for \"Self Medicate\" found significant airplay and the song was featured on the soundtrack for the thriller film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This video features the group performing the song in a city park as well as various acts of indulgent \"self medication\" by townspeople (i.e. secretively buying pornography, gorging on food, making out). The following year, MTV2 held a fan's choice poll for the Best Metal Videos of 2004. The results aired on the December 25 edition of \"Headbangers Ball\" with \"Self Medicate\" ranking in at #18.\n\nThe CD is Content/Copy-Protected with MediaMax Digital Rights Management Software on it.\n\nJoey D'amico, who played guitar on the album, stated \"Before, we wanted to be really heavy, but we so wanted the music to be melodic, so we'd slap those parts right next to each other.

He noted its more melodic approach, writing \"while the band's forceful attack still won't land it in the pop survey, Bendeth's input does manage to give the band a foot up on other alternative metal acts in the run for airplay in the \"active rock\" format.\" Luerssen also criticized the track \"Breathless\", stating that it \"finds the outfit capably shifting into pop ballad mode à la Creed.\" He goes on to write \"That momentary lapse in direction is soon corrected, however, and as \"The Mourning After\" unfolds, tracks like the cathartic \"F.E.\" and the spooky \"A Season in Hell\" right the wrongs for 40 Below Summer's ballooning headbanger clientele.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 2000, the AIHL is sanctioned by Ice Hockey Australia (a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation). The league is run by its own board of directors led by the AIHL commissioner. The AIHL is considered a semi-professional league. Players are unpaid, however, they can receive a variety of benefits such as travel expenses, motor vehicles and accommodation. The AIHL champion is awarded the Goodall Cup, the world’s third oldest ice hockey trophy, having been first awarded in 1909.\n\nThe AIHL is currently contested by eight franchised teams from five Australian states and territories. The most successful team in AIHL history is the Newcastle Northstars, who have claimed six AIHL championships. The current champions from 2019 are the Sydney Bears.\n\nThe Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) was formed in 2000 following the collapse of the former national league. In its first season, the AIHL comprised three teams – the Adelaide Avalanche, Canberra Knights, and the Sydney Bears. During the first two seasons the teams competed in round-robin weekends over the length of the season, with the two top teams playing a single final. Adelaide Avalanche finished first in both years after the regular season, with the Sydney Bears winning the Goodall Cup in the 2001 playoffs. In 2002 the AIHL expanded to six teams with the inclusion of the Melbourne Ice, Newcastle North Stars and the West Sydney Ice Dogs. The Sydney Bears finished first in the regular season standings and won the Goodall Cup playoffs. At the start of the 2003 AIHL season it was announced that the finals playoff would be expanded to include the top four finishing teams after the regular season. Newcastle North Stars won their first regular season and their first Goodall Cup. The following season the West Sydney Ice Dogs won their first Goodall Cup after defeating the Newcastle North Stars in the final. In 2005 the AIHL expanded to eight teams with the Central Coast Rhinos and the Brisbane Blue Tongues joining the league. During the 2005 season the Avalanche signed former National Hockey League (NHL) player Steve McKenna who played over 350 games in the NHL while the North Stars won their second Goodall Cup. In 2006 the Brisbane Blue Tongues signed Canadian Rob Zamuner who had played nearly 800 games in the NHL. The North Stars went on to win their second consecutive Goodall Cup title, defeating Adelaide for the second year in a row.\n\nThe 2007 AIHL season opened with the Avalanche and the Blue Tongues announcing the signing of former NHL players Mel Angelstad and Tyrone Garner respectively. The Bears won the 2007 Goodall Cup, their first since 2002, after defeating the North Stars in the final. Starting the 2008 season the Brisbane Blue Tongues announced their relocation to the Gold Coast to become the Gold Coast Blue Tongues as well as the signing of former Tampa Bay Lightning player Gaetan Royer. During the season the Adelaide Avalanche folded due to financial problems. Following the withdrawal of the Avalanche a new team was formed, the Adelaide Adrenaline. Newcastle North Stars went on to win the 2008 Goodall Cup, defeating West Sydney Ice Dogs in the final. In 2009 the Central Coast Rhinos left the league after refusing to accept the AIHL's new licensing model and went on to join the newly formed Australian International Ice Hockey Cup. 2009 also saw the Goodall Cup withdrawn from the AIHL by Ice Hockey Australia so it could return to being a state contested tournament. It was replaced by the H. Newman Reid Trophy which was won by the Adrenaline. The following season Ice Hockey Australia returned the Goodall Cup to the AIHL with the H. Newman Reid Trophy being consigned to be the prize for the winner of the regular season. Melbourne Ice won their first Goodall Cup, defeating the Adrenaline in the final 6–4. In 2011 the league returned to an eight team competition with the inclusion of the Melbourne-based Mustangs IHC. The AIHL also granted a ninth team, the Perth Thunder, a provisional licence to play exhibition games during the 2011 season and potentially securing a vote to join the league in 2012.\n\nIn August 2011 the AIHL and the New Zealand Ice Hockey League (NZIHL) announced the formation of the Trans-Tasman Champions League. The Trans-Tasman Champions League began in 2012 and was hosted in Australia, with the series shifting to New Zealand in 2013. The series features two teams from each the AIHL and the NZIHL each playing the others once with the winner being the team who finishes first in the round-robin standings. The two teams chosen from each league will be the regular season champions and the winner of the playoff. In a situation where the winning of both events is the same the runner up of the playoff final will be selected to represent their respective league. Melbourne Ice won both the H. Newman Reid Trophy and the Goodall Cup after finishing first in the 2011 regular season standings and winning the playoffs after defeating the Newcastle North Stars in the final. In November 2011 following the annual general meeting it was announced that Perth Thunder had been accepted as a full member of the league expanding the competition to nine teams for 2012. It was also announced that from 2012 the league would be split into two conferences to manage costs and length of the season. The two conferences where named the Bauer Conference and Easton Conference after the AIHL signed a three-year deal with the Skaters Network who is the distributor of the ice hockey brands Bauer Hockey and Easton. The Bauer Conference will consist of the Canberra Knights, Newcastle North Stars, Sydney Bears, and the Sydney Ice Dogs, while the Easton Conference includes the Adelaide Adrenaline, Gold Coast Blue Tongues, Melbourne Ice, Mustangs IHC and the Perth Thunder. Following the announcement of the conference system a change in the finals playoff structure was also announced. The winners of each conference at the end of the regular season would play in a semi-final against the runner-up of the opposing conference with the winners of the semi-finals progressing to the Goodall Cup final. Prior to the start of the 2012 season the AIHL also announced a one-year partnership with Virgin Australia in which the airline would become the leagues preferred supplier for the 2012 season. The 2012 regular season was won by the Newcastle North Stars after they finished one point ahead of the Melbourne Ice. The Melbourne Ice went on to win the Goodall Cup playoffs for the third year in a row after they defeated the North Stars in the final.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2013 season it was announced that the Gold Coast Blue Tongues' licence had been suspended due to the team being unable to secure a home venue for 2013. It was also announced that the league had entered into a deal with Fox Sports which involved airing one game a week during the season. The 2013 regular season was won by the Sydney Ice Dogs who also went on to win the 2013 Goodall Cup, breaking Melbourne Ice's three-year streak. It was the Ice Dogs first regular season title and their first Goodall Cup since 2004. In February 2014 it was announced that Canberra Knights had folded operations and would not be competing in the 2014 season. Club owner John Raut cited financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance as the reasons behind the move. The following day it was announced that the player group headed by captain Mark Rummukainen had approached the league with plans on taking on the club's licence. The following month the league announced that they had granted a provisional licence to a Canberra consortium, which involved the player group, to take on the licence and replace the Knights in the 2014 season. The new team was announced as the CBR Brave. The Melbourne Mustangs went on to win their first 2014 regular season title and Goodall Cup, defeating the Melbourne Ice in the playoffs final. The Brave, in their debut season, finished the regular season in third and but were knocked out in the semi-finals by the Ice. In December 2014 the Central Coast Rhinos applied to re-enter the league at the 2014 Annual General Meeting however their applicated was rejected for undisclosed reasons. Also during the off-season it was announced that the Gold Coast Blue Tongues' licence had expired, two years after they were suspended due to being unable to secure a home venue.\n\nThe AIHL season commences mid April and runs through to the last weekend of August or the first weekend of September. Games are usually played on Saturday or Sunday, typically starting between 2.00 pm and 5.30 pm depending on the venue.\n\nTeams nominally play each of their seven opponents in the league four times for a total of 28 regular season games. In seasons prior to 2011, some games were played for double-points (and counted as two games) to keep travel costs down.\n\nThe length of matches has changed throughout the history of the AIHL. From inception in 2000 till 2012 matches were forty-five minutes long. From 2013 till 2019 the AIHL increased the match length to fifty minutes, consisting of two fifteen minute periods followed by a twenty minute third period. On 11 February 2020, the AIHL announced the league would be adopting the international standard sixty minutes match length. The change increased the league's matches by ten minutes and standardised the period lengths to twenty minutes each. The change came into effect for the 2020 season.\n\nThe points system and overtime formats used by the AIHL has developed and changed over the history of the league.\n\nThe current points system, first introduced in 2006, follows similar systems widely used in Europe. 3 points is awarded for a win, and 0 points for a loss. If a match is tied at the end of regulation time, overtime (OT) is used to guarantee a match winner. An overtime win is worth 2 points and an overtime loss is worth 1 point. \n\nThe current overtime rules deployed in the AIHL for regular season matches was introduced in 2019. At the end of regulation time there is a five minute three on three overtime period, with the first goal winning the game. If no one scores during this OT period the match is then sent to a shootout to decide the winner and points split. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2005, the league had a then NHL style four on four five minute overtime period. If no one scored, the match was then officially recorded as a tie. In 2006 the league removed the five minute overtime period and replaced it with a shootout, meaning every match would have a winner. The shootout only system was used by the league until the end of the 2018 season.\n\nFor AIHL finals (play-offs), overtime periods are played like regulation third periods except for the golden goal rule – in an overtime period, the game ends when one team scores a goal; the teams are at full strength (five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002 the AIHL had a single match final, known as the championship final, between the two teams who finished first and second in the regular round-robin season. In 2002, the Goodall Cup was awarded to the winner of the championship final for the first time, previously it was used as the award for the annual inter-state tournament held by IHA. In 2003, the AIHL switched to a four team playoff system, expanding the format into a 'finals weekend'. Retaining the single-match series, two semi-finals and a final would be played at a single venue over one weekend. The top four teams from the regular season qualify for the finals weekend. The two semi finals are conducted on the Saturday with 1 v 4 (semi final 1) playing first followed by 2 v 3 (semi final 2). The winners of the two semi finals advance to the final, held on the Sunday, to compete for the Goodall Cup and the AIHL Championship. As of 2018, finals have been held in three different Australian states including New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, six cities including, Sydney, Adelaide, Central Coast, Newcastle, Penrith and Melbourne and eight stadiums as detailed in the table below:\n\n\nThe champions of the AIHL are awarded the Goodall Cup, a perpetual national trophy third in age only to the Stanley Cup (1892) and the Allan Cup (1908). The Goodall Cup was incorporated into the AIHL in 2002 after the league expanded to 6 teams. The Goodall Cup is awarded to the team that wins the Finals series/playoffs weekend at the end of each season. The team that holds the Goodall Cup is considered to be the Australian champion.\n\nThe Goodall Cup was withdrawn from the AIHL in 2009 by the cup's custodians, Ice Hockey Australia. The Goodall Cup was instead awarded to South Australia in a traditional state vs state tournament held in Adelaide, South Australia in October 2009 as a 100-year celebration of the Goodall Cup.\n\nIn 2010 the Goodall Cup was offered back to the AIHL, and the cup accepted by a vote of the members and board. The Goodall Cup has been re-instated by the AIHL as its finals tournament trophy and as the prize signifying Australian champions of ice hockey.\n\nLike in the case of the Stanley Cup, the original Goodall Cup is considered too delicate to travel and a replica is now awarded to the league champion team.\n\nFirst awarded in 2015, the Mick McCormack Cup is awarded annually to the most valuable player of the Australian Ice Hockey League All-Star Game. As of 2018, the Cup was re-purposed as the award to the winning team of the Australian Ice Hockey League All-Star Game. \n\nThe trophy is named after Australian ice hockey advocate, Mick McCormack, who is the CEO of APA Group.\n\nRecipients of the Mick McCormack Cup include Pat O’Kane from the Melbourne Mustangs (2015), Michael Dorr of Perth Thunder (2016), and Dominic Jalbert of CBR Brave (2017). Team Rezek won the cup in 2018.\n\nIn 2009 Ice Hockey Australia withdrew the Goodall Cup from the AIHL, claiming it was instead to presented to the winning team from IHA's own tournament to be run in South Australia, celebrating the Cup's 100th anniversary since it was first awarded in a game between NSW and Victoria in 1909. Without a major trophy to present to its finals winning team, the AIHL designed and had manufactured its own unique trophy.\n\nThe new AIHL Champions Trophy was awarded to the 2009 AIHL Champions, the Adelaide Adrenaline following their victory in the 2009 final.\n\nIn 2010 the AIHL Champions Trophy was re-launched as the H Newman Reid Trophy, honouring the minor premiers from each season back to 2008.\n\n\nThe H Newman Reid Trophy is awarded to the regular season's minor premiers; that is, the team that finishes first overall in the standings.\nReid is considered the father of ice hockey in Australia, opening Australia's first two ice rinks and employing key people who introduced Australians, including his own children, to winter sports.\n\nThe H Newman Reid Trophy was first awarded in 2010 to the Newcastle North Stars after they finished first in the regular season with 54 points.\n\nThe Reid Trophy was backdated to 2008 including minor premiers the Sydney Bears (2008) and the Newcastle North Stars (2009 & 2010).\n\n\nThe V.I.P. Cup was awarded to the minor premiers of each season; that is, the team that finishes first overall in the standings at the end of the regular season. The VIP cup was last awarded to the Adelaide Avalanche in 2007. The VIP Cup was not returned to the league and has been replaced by the H Newman Reid Trophy.\n\n\nThe Wilson Cup is awarded to the winner of the AIHL pre-season competition, which began in 2007 and ran again in 2008 and 2009. No Wilson Cup was run in 2010 or 2011.\n\n\n"}

In 1992 Roll moved to Greg LeMond's Z team and added mountain biking to his racing accomplishments. Roll continued racing mountain bikes professionally through 1998. Roll is known in the cycling world, and to his global cable television fans, fondly, as \"Bobke\".\n\nHe has written \"Bobke: A Ride on the Wild Side of Cycling\", \"Bobke II\", and two \"Tour de France Companion\" volumes. (\"Bobke\" is Southern Dutch for \"Bobby\".) He has also had many columns published in \"VeloNews\". He is credited with suggesting that Joe Parkin, professional cyclist and author, move to Europe and wrote the foreword for Joe's first book.\n\nAs the accounts of the now legendary story go, in 1998 a young Lance Armstrong, continuing to recover from testicular cancer remediation, had recently dropped out of the Paris–Nice cycling race. Armstrong's training coach, Chris Carmichael, invited the affable and entertaining Roll to journey to Boone, North Carolina, to talk with Lance and do training rides with the young Armstrong for several days. Armstrong was extremely discouraged by his recent European cycling results, and Carmichael believed Armstrong had lost his career focus and was on the verge of fully retiring from professional cycling. Almost out of desperation, Carmichael talked Armstrong into doing one last series of intensive training rides, with \"Bobke\" as his riding partner. Roll was up to the challenge. Armstrong was a promising future cycling talent and his cycling career was in jeopardy.\n\nAccording to Roll, \"I am sure Lance had probably never met a bike racer like me...a person who could still find some joy and happiness in such weather misery. We had eight hours a day, for eight straight days, of continuous riding in the pouring rain - rain in Biblical proportions! I think Lance would've turned things around even without our talks and rides in the Appalachia[n]s, but it turned out to be a pivotal career event for him (and Roll had made a new cycling friend).\" A refocused and encouraged Armstrong went on to a successful fourth-place finish in the Vuelta a España, and within a year and a half he had won his first yellow jersey overall victory in the Tour de France road race. Armstrong has since had his yellow jersey wins nullified due to doping. (Roll's tale of the ride is in \"Bobke II\"; Armstrong's is in \"It's Not About the Bike\".)\n\nRoll continues to enjoy riding road and mountain bicycles for recreation, and is a member of the veteran cable television broadcasting team (along with Phil Liggett, MBE and the late Paul Sherwen) who serve as road cycling expert-commentators for the NBC Sports Network cable network's coverage of the Tour de France, Vuelta a España, Giro d'Italia, Paris–Roubaix, Tour of California, and other international cycling road races.\n\nRoll has appeared in a series of Road ID Tour de France television commercials as himself, riding a bus along with \"Tour Mania\" (a costumed-disguised rowdy faux rock group played by well-known professional cyclists, such as George Hincapie).\n\n\n\n"}

The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».\n\nA shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the mailing list of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.\nA draft \"A2K treaty\" was later produced. The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.\n\nAccess to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:\nArticle 27\nEveryone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.\n\nEveryone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.\n\nA2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:\n\n... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.\n\nCP Tech (now Knowledge Ecology International) say: \"the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods.\"\n\nMany different groups refer to the A2K movement. Consumers International is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain, and defines the movement as:\n\nthe umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.\nThese goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.\n\n\n\n"}

The Beira line is important as it provides port access for landlocked states such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Katanga Province.\n\nOriginally the Beira railroad already established a connection to Salisbury, now Harare, in 1899 and had been a link in the rail system of southern Africa.\n\nBuilding of the Beira railway started in 1892, during the Portuguese rule of the territory of Mozambique. First, a narrow gauge railway was constructed from Beira to the border city Mutare (Umtali) in Zimbabwe, in total long and opened on 4 February 1898.\n\nIn 1893 work started in Vryburg, Cape Province, South Africa, to construct a railway to the north, later to be connected to the Beira Railway. In 1898 a line from Salisbury to Mutare was opened, with subsequent conversion of the connecting narrow gauge stretch to Beira in 1900.\n\nIn 1905, the railway was completed after the opening of the Victoria Falls Bridge at the border of Zambia.\n\nThe narrow gauge locomotives were later acquired by the South African Railways to be designated to SAR Class NG6.\n\nNineteenth-century narrow gauge steam locomotives of the Beira Railway.\nThe Beira railway has two major segments, the Machipanda line to Zimbabwe, and the Sena line to the coal fields of Moatize with further connection to Malawi.\n\nAfter Mozambique gained independence in 1975, both segments were damaged during the guerrilla fighting in the 1980s when RENAMO sabotaged the railroad.\n\nOperational activity has been regained on the Machipanda line, and rehabilitation of the Sena line has been completed to Moatize, a town in Central Mozambique, and the first coal train from there to the port of Beira, operated by the Brazilian-based firm Vale, operated in August 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210267", "title": "Revco", "text": "Revco\n\nRevco Discount Drug Stores (known simply as Revco or Revco, D.S.), once based in Twinsburg, Ohio, was a major drug store chain operating through the Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the Southeastern United States. The chain's stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RXR. Revco was sold to CVS Pharmacy for $2.8 billion in February 1997. When it was sold, the chain had over 2,500 stores.\n\nRevco, originally known as Registered Vitamin Company, was founded in 1956 in Detroit, Michigan, by Sidney Dworkin and Bernie Shulman. Dworkin led Revco until 1986 as CEO, and then he served as chairman until 1987.\n\nUp to 1983, Revco grew tremendously; the chain had over 2,200 stores and over $2.2 billion in sales. The chain then began to stumble. In 1983, its vitamins were blamed for the deaths of a number of premature infants. In order to prevent a hostile takeover and increase short-term profitability, Dworkin then led the chain into a deal that would seal its fate many years later. Under his leadership, Revco purchased a company called Odd Lot Trading Co., a closeout retailer based in New Jersey. Revco's management lost its focus on the drug store portion of its business due to problems with Odd Lot Trading Co., and earnings tumbled. The chain also began to merchandise items such as televisions, furniture, and other non-core items, and the heavy investment proved to be a failure.\n\nIn 1986, Revco was the target of a leveraged buyout. Part of the buyout deal was to reduce costs by closing stores and by reducing inventory to repay debts. This left the company with a shortfall of cash, and suppliers stopped shipping inventory, causing the chain to lose customers. This eventually caused the chain to file for bankruptcy in 1988. Revco was bailed out of bankruptcy by investor Sam Zell, in part to fend off separate takeover attempts by both Eckerd and Rite Aid. In 1990, 221 Midwest Revco stores were purchased by Reliable Drug, based in Cleveland, OH. The Michigan stores purchased by Reliable were sold almost immediately to Perry Drugs. Revco emerged from bankruptcy, as an independent company, in 1992.\n\nRevco's turnaround from bankruptcy was and is often still considered the \"model\" of a business recovering from bankruptcy. The chain closed many underperforming stores (including selling all stores west of the Mississippi River to the son of the then-current Rite Aid CEO), reduced costs, introduced computerized point-of-sale systems, and introduced a new store design to help increase sales. The chain shrank from about 2,200 stores to about 1,500 stores during this period.\n\nThe hallmark of the new store designs was the arrangement of the store aisles, which was developed and introduced as the company was emerging from bankruptcy. Half the store had aisles that ran from the front of the store to the back in straight rows. Seasonal merchandise, food, greeting cards, baby supplies, hardware and office supplies were in this half of the store. The other half of the store, the health and beauty sections, had their aisles slanted so customers could see down the aisles as they walked from the front doors to the pharmacy, which was in the back of the store. A very wide main aisle led from the front door to the pharmacy, and this aisle separated the slanted aisles from the \"straight aisles\". While many drug stores in the U.S. have variations of this design today, it was a departure at the time from the usual all front-to-back, straight aisles. In Revco's free standing stores, the slanted aisles had an open ceiling above them; the other aisles had a drop ceiling over them. In these stores today, which are now CVS stores, the open ceiling and drop ceiling are still in place (though all the aisles are now aligned in a traditional manner).\n\nThe new stores also were decorated in soft blues and greys, had track lighting, and low hanging lights over the greeting cards, all which gave the store a \"soft\" appearance. Revco introduced strict rules about having no handwritten signs or merchandise displays sitting directly on the floor, which it thought gave the stores a cleaner look. It also required its employees to dress extremely professionally, with men wearing ties. All front-end employees had to wear a navy blue smock.\n\nAfter emerging from bankruptcy, the chain grew tremendously again, increasing its store count to over 2,500 stores. Part of this growth came from the purchase of over 800 Hook's/SupeRx drug stores in 1994 in the Mid-Atlantic region and Midwest, and Birmingham, Alabama based Big B Drugs in the southeast, which was its last purchase, made in 1996.\n\nIn order to help Zell recover his investment in the company, the company's management was under pressure to sell the company. In 1996, Revco entered into an agreement with Rite Aid to be bought out. The Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to stop the buyout, saying that Rite Aid would become a monopoly in many markets because Rite Aid and Revco had many overlapping stores, and Rite Aid withdrew its bid for the company.\n\nThe chain was purchased by CVS Pharmacy in June 1997, which at the time was half of Revco's size, and CVS rebranded or closed all of the 2,552 Revco stores by summer of 1998. In at least one market, Richmond, Virginia, the Federal Trade Commission prohibited CVS from taking over the Revco stores, stating that the company would have a near monopoly. So CVS sold the Revco stores it had bought to Eckerd. Eckerd changed most of the Richmond area Revco stores to Eckerd stores, and closed a few of them. A few others closed within a few years. Eckerd maintained its presence in the Richmond market until 2007, when it was bought out by Rite Aid. By that time, however, Rite Aid's operations in the Richmond area did not constitute a monopoly, as Walgreens had entered the market in the late 1990s and opened many successful stores.\n\n\nRevco was well known for the slogan \"You need all the Revco you can get!\" and its \"A Friend for Life\" slogan and senior citizen's discount program, called \"Senior Shoppers\" (in which customers over 65 received 10% off their purchase every Wednesday). Revco also had a discount program for customers with disabilities (called \"Helping Hands\") and for baby supplies (called \"Baby Bunch\").\n\nAt the time, it was highly unusual for a chain of Revco's size to offer such discount programs, and the chain was extremely popular with customers because of these programs. Revco may have been well ahead of its time, as its discount programs resembled today's loyalty card programs used by grocery stores and CVS. Revco had customers fill out an information card with their contact information and gave them a card to identify their participation in the discount program (though Revco did not track purchases as many loyalty card programs do today).\n\nRevco used gymnast Mary Lou Retton as an advertising spokesperson in the 1990s, who often began commercials by saying, \"And another thing...\" and would end them by saying, \"...and now you know. Revco.\"\n\nRite Aid now offers a similar discount program to \"Senior Shoppers\", called \"Living More\". This may be because Rite-Aid's James P. Mastrian, who is the Executive Vice President of Marketing, held the same position at Revco from 1994 to 1997.\n\nTwins Days, a festival honoring the twin brothers who founded the city of Twinsburg, was the brainchild of Charles R. DeHaven, then Revco's Assistant Vice President of Public Relations. DeHaven planned a number of promotional events in 1976 to commemorate the nation's bicentennial. From the small gathering of 37 sets of twins that first year, the festival now attracts thousands from all over the world and makes national headlines every summer.\n\nRevco was one of the first drug store chains in the country to have a centralized pharmacy computer system, which it called Prescription Access Link (PAL). This system allowed each Revco access to any other Revco's prescription information. It highly advertised this system to customers, which allowed a customer to go any Revco to have their prescription refilled without the stores having to call each other on the phone. While this type of system is the norm in drug stores today, it was revolutionary when Revco used it. PAL was introduced to Revco stores during its emergence from bankruptcy. Revco providers eventually closed their stores\n\nRevco founded and sponsored a marathon in Cleveland, which was often referred to among runners as \"The Revco\" (its full name was \"The Revco Cleveland Marathon and 10K\"). The first race took place in 1976, when jogging/running first became a national fitness craze. Famous Olympic athlete Jesse Owens fired the starting gun at the first race, which started at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, wound its way up Rt. 91 north through Twinsburg and Solon, and eventually ended in Cleveland. This particularly grueling course was changed in later years to begin and end at Cleveland State University. Many famous runners participated over the years, as \"The Revco\" became an Olympic qualifying event. After CVS bought Revco, the race became known as the \"CVS Marathon and 10K\" before CVS dropped its sponsorship in the early 2000s (decade). The race is now sponsored by Rite Aid.\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by Philip Yordan, based on a novel by Maritta M. Wolff.\n\nAway for two years, a woman named Mary (Ava Gardner) returns to her home in a small town (a 'whistle stop'). She attempts to reconcile with Kenny Veech (George Raft), her former romantic interest, but he is jealous and bitter, particularly after she takes up with Veech's mortal enemy, nightclub owner Lew Lentz (Tom Conway).\n\nGitlo (Victor McLaglen), a friend of Kenny's who works for Lentz, talks him into a scheme to rob and kill Lentz at a train station as he leaves for Detroit, then hide his corpse to make Mary believe he chose not to return. Mary manages to foil Veech's plans, but she remains torn between the two men.\n\nSeeking vengeance, Lentz tries to pin a murder on Veech and Gitlo, who barely make a getaway. Gitlo and Lentz end up killing one another, and Mary finds Veech recovering from a gunshot wound to the arm he had suffered while making his and Gitlo's escape. The movie ends with them arm-in-arm, walking away to live happily ever after.\n\n\nThe film was based on the debut novel by 23 year old Maritta Wolff who wrote it in her senior year at the University of Michigan.\n\nPhilip Yordan bought the film rights in November 1944 and wrote a screenplay. Yordan later said \"I used a small portion of the actual book and developed the story from there\" because he said the book was too explicit sexually.\n\nIn February 1945 Yordan sold the project to producer Seymour Nebenza. Yordan remained associate producer in exchange for 50% of the profits. The film was financed by a bank in Palm Springs. Ava Garner was borrowed from MGM and Tom Conway from RKO.\n\nYordan said \"my script was very good\" but felt the producer made a mistake casting Raft. \"He had been a big name around the world and he was on the skids and we could afford him, but he looked like hell and who wanted to see this old man with Ava Gardner? It should have been a young guy like Burt Lancaster.\"\n\nFilming started June 29, 1945.\n\nThe film was a box office hit. It was one of a series of popular movies Raft made as a freelancer following leaving Warner Bros.\n\nWhen the film was released, film critic Bosley Crowther, dismissed the film, writing, \"A slice of sordid life in a small mid-Western town was somewhat faithfully reflected in Maritta Wolff's novel, \"Whistle Stop\", but the same can't be said for the picture, based upon it, which came to the Globe on Saturday. This plainly remote and artificial concoction lacks flavor, consistency, reason and even dramatic suspense. And it is also abominably acted—which covers about everything ... The film was directed by Leonide Moguy, late of France. Don't ask us why.\"\n\n\"Variety\", however, was more positive in their review. The staff wrote, \"Heavy melodrama, adapted from the Maritta M. Wolff novel of same title, is somber melodrama, vignetting a seamy side of life in a small town. Production and playing are excellent and the direction strong, although latter is given to occasional arty tone ... Gardner displays her best work to date as the girl who must have her man. McLaglen hits top form as the not too bright bartender, and Conway is smooth as the heavy. Score is an aid in projecting the somber mood.\"\n\nRecently, film critic Dennis Schwartz was harsh in his review, writing, \"A low-level B film on the seamy side-of-life, that revolves around a bitter love triangle. It's directed without too much skill by Leonide Moguy (\"Paris After Dark\"/\"Two Women\"/\"Diary of a Bad Girl\") ... The wannabe film noir is dumber than dumb. The convoluted storyline has about as much going for it as the risible loser performance does by a miscast George Raft, who never looked quite as stiff as he does in this stinker. All the main characters are unsympathetic, and the plot is brainless. It's one of those somber films about the human condition that has nothing important to say about the human condition, but is unintentionally funny when it tries to be the most serious.\"\n\nIn 2000, Bay-Tek Incorporated released an arcade skill-game under the name \"Whistle Stop\". In a 2015 interview with Noah Simmons, the artist who worked on the designs for the game, it was revealed that a main inspiration for the theme of the game was the \"...elements of noir genre found in the 1946 film 'Whistle Stop' ... but most influential to the development was the train-station scene.\" The game borrows multiple sound effects from the film.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210287", "title": "Indo-Guyanese", "text": "Indo-Guyanese\n\nIndo-Guyanese or Indian-Guyanese, are Guyanese nationals who trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent. They are the descendants of settlers who arrived between the 19th and 20th centuries from the former pre-partitioned sub-continent of India during the time of the British Raj.\n\nMost of the Indian settlers who came to Guyana were from North India, specifically from the Bhojpur and Awadh regions of the Hindi Belt located in the present-day states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand. The vast majority of Indians came as indentured laborers during the 19th century, spurred on by political upheaval, ramifications of the Mutiny of 1857, and famine. Others arrived as merchants, landowners and farmers pushed out by many of the same factors.\n\nIndo-Guyanese are the largest ethnic group in Guyana identified by the official census, about 40% of the population in 2012. There is also a large Indo-Guyanese diaspora in countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn May 5, 1838, the year in which the abolition of slavery was finalized in the British West Indies and the beginning of the indentured labor system, 396 Indian immigrants popularly known as the 'Gladstone Coolies' landed in British Guiana from Calcutta in the Bengal Presidency region of British India. This was the beginning of the indenture system which was to continue for over three-quarters of a century and whose essential features were very reminiscent of slavery. Within a decade Indian immigration was largely responsible for changing the fortunes of the sugar industry, the mainstay of the economy, from the predicted 'ruin' to prosperity.\n\nUp to the early 1860s recruits in North India were drawn from in and around Calcutta and from the Chota Nagpur plateau, a sub-division of the Bengal Presidency about from Calcutta . Recruiting operations were pushed further north-westwards and the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (Modern Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar became the main suppliers of colonial labor.\n\nThe importation of labor from the Indian subcontinent was part of a continuing search by Guianese planters for a labor force that was docile, reliable and amenable to discipline under harsh, tropical conditions. Emancipation had conferred on the Guianese laborers both physical and occupational mobility. The majority of Indian immigrants were drawn from small villages in North India with smaller batches coming from the Tamil and Telugu districts of South India, and North Sri Lanka. They were recruited, very often on spurious promises, by professional recruiters, largely assisted by paid local agents called \"Arkatis\" in North India and \"Maistris\" in South India.\n\nThis system of recruitment by local agents formed the backbone of all recruiting operations from the inception of the system to its cessation in 1917. Intimidation, coercion, and deception were very often used to recruit Indian laborers. Women, in particular, were very vulnerable. When laborers were difficult to enlist, the recruiters resorted to such illegal practices as kidnapping and forced detention. Many recruited to be shipped off to the Caribbean, were falsely advised on where they were heading. Names of places would be altered to fit a higher meaning. For example, recruiters told migrants heading to Dutch Suriname they were heading to Sri-Ram instead of Suriname, taking into account Ram in the Hindu religion means \"a religious place where good triumphs evil\".\n\nWith a need for labor, after the slave emancipation within British territories in 1834, the recruited Indian immigrants set sail for Guiana and other British West Indian territories. Upon arrival, the newly transplanted indentured servants were forced to adapt to extreme tropical conditions, along with their new working contract working conditions. Between 1835 and 1918, 341,600 indentured laborers from India were imported into British Guiana.\n\nWith the increase of Indians laborers, hostility and fear of being undermined derived from the existing working class of newly free slaves in British Guiana. Treatment of the newly arrived immigrants was horrendous, and they were pushed into isolated communities.\n\nThe indentured servants were required to sign a contract, the terms binding their service to a plantation for five years, while earning a fixed daily wage. Once this five-year period had passed, they would have another five years of industrial residence in Guiana, then they were entitled to free repatriation. At the end of the contract, laborers either returned to India or stayed in British Guiana. Those who stayed received land and money to create their own businesses.\n\nUnlike the African slaves, the East Indian indentured workers were permitted to retain some of their cultural traditions. But the process of assimilation has made the culture of the modern Indo-Guyanese more homogeneous than that of their immigrant ancestors.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1917 over 500 ship voyages with 238,909 indentured Indian immigrants came to Guyana; while just 75,898 of them or their children returned. The vast majority came from the Hindustani (or Hindi) speaking areas of North India. The most popular dialect spoken was Bhojpuri (spoken in east Uttar Pradesh and west Bihar), followed by Awadhi (spoken in central Uttar Pradesh). 62% of the immigrants came from districts that are now part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; 21% from districts that are now part of Bihar state; 6% were from pre-partitioned Bengal; 3% from what are today Orissa and Jharkhand states; 3% from what is today Tamil Nadu state; 3% from Central India, 1% from pre-partitioned Punjab - and the remaining 1% from the rest of India.\n\nThe religious breakdown was 85% Hindu, 15% Muslims.\n\nIndenture documents show Hindu by caste: 11% were Brahmin, Bhumihar, Chatri, Rajput and Thakur castes; 1% were of the merchant or writer castes; 30% were of the medium agricultural castes; 9% were of the artisan castes; 2% were of the petty trading castes; 2% were of fishermen and boatmen castes; 25% were from menial or dalit castes; 3% were Hindus who were Madrasis; 2% were Hill Coolies or Tribals. \n\nEast Indian workers were housed together and placed in work gangs without consideration of caste, and no solidified caste groups survived the early colonial period. \n\nGuyanese Hindus continue to observe holidays such as Phagwah also known outside the country as Holi (burning of Holika) and Diwali (festival of lights) among others while Muslims celebrate the holidays Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Through British influence, celebrating holidays such as Christmas and Easter, is common regardless of religious beliefs. In Guyana, Indian Arrival Day is celebrated on May 5 commemorating the first arrival of indentured servants from India to the country, on May 5, 1838. On this day, the workers arrived to work in sugar plantations.\n\nAmong Hindus and Muslims, arranged, comparatively early marriages were common in rural areas until the modern period (early 1960s) but are rare now. Middle-class Indians had greater freedom in choosing a spouse, especially if the woman was a professional. As in most parts of the western world marriage now occurs later, and the family unit is smaller than in the past. Indo Guyanese families are patriarchal with an extended system, where family members assist each other, like many other groups in Guyana. For individuals who are Hindu, wedding ceremonies are now performed with the bride and groom dressed in traditional Indian clothing, as an expression of their culture. If it can be afforded there is usually a Hindu wedding ceremony and also a western or \"regular\" wedding reception, or a small Hindu ceremony and a much larger \"reception\" so friends from the larger community can attend.\n\nWith the blending of cultures in the Caribbean, Indo-Caribbean dishes became one of the dominant notes throughout most of the English Caribbean, with dishes such as curry and roti and dhal bhat. Dishes include gulab jamun, mohanbhog (prasad), kheer (sweet rice), bara, pholourie and chutney or sour, bhaji (made with young moringa, spinach or spiny amaranth leaves), and seven curry, and other dishes associated with religious functions. In Guyana, among the Indo-Guyanese people, it is popular to eat curried or fried vegetables such as okra or \"okro\", lablab beans or \"seim\", pumpkin or \"kohra\", bitter melon or \"karela\", drumstick or \"saijan\", long beans or \"bora\", calabash or \"lauki\", and eggplant known as \"baigan\" or \"balanjay\". \n\nThe Indo-Guyanese community has always had great admiration for Bollywood, the Hindi film industry. Bollywood movies and songs have had a huge impact upon the Guyanese pop culture since the early 1950s. Many Bollywood stars have visited and performed in Guyana like megastars Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Preity Zinta, also very popular singers such as Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Shreya Ghoshal, Udit Narayan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Kumar Sanu, Hari Om Sharan, and Anup Jalota have had very successful shows in Guyana. In 1980, Lata Mangeshkar, one of the most beloved singers in Guyana, was greeted with crowds of fans and was presented with the key of the city of Georgetown, Guyana on her visit. Indian soap operas have recently grown in popularity in Guyana. The most popular genres of music among Indo-Guyanese people include chutney, chutney soca, baithak gana, bhajan, Bollywood, Indian classical music, Indian folk music, and soca. Popular local singers include Sundar Popo, Terry Gajraj, Mahendra Ramkellawan, Romeo \"Mystic\" Nermal, Kassri Narine, Joyce Ormela Harris, Komal Ram, Nisha Benjamin, Harry Panday, Ashni Matadin, Pita Pyaree, Ramdew Chaitoe, Dropati, Ravi Bissambhar, Rakesh Yankaran, Rikki Jai, Drupatee Ramgoonai, Rasika Dindial, and Babla & Kanchan. Indian instrumental influence can be seen in Guyana through the use of the tabla, harmonium, dholak, dhantal, and tassa drums.\n\nIndo-Guyanese women have always been a great asset to beauty pageants in Guyana. Most notable Miss Guyana is Shakira Baksh, the 1967 Miss Guyana, who went on to become a runner-up at the Miss World 1967 pageant and later married popular British actor Michael Caine. Rafieya Husain, Miss Guyana World 2014, won the ‘Beauty With a Purpose Title’, received the Miss World Caribbean, and became a contestant in the Final 10 at the Miss World 2014 pageant. Alana Seebarran, Miss India Guyana, won the Miss India Worldwide 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Ian Bowsher.\n\nThe first student intake was in 1968 with a single grade (known at the time as 'Form 1') which formally graduated from the school in 1973. The inaugural graduating year of 1973 remains close-knit and has recently held a reunion with an outstanding number of students in attendance (more than 70, close to 40 years after last seeing each other).\n\nThe location of the school right at the beach lends itself to many curricular and non-curricular beach activities.\n\nOver ensuing years, the school has grown in enrolments to its current level, necessitating expansion of the campus and construction of additional facilities.\n\nBarrenjoey's feeder primary schools include Avalon Public School, Bilgola Plateau Public School and a few other schools in the local area.\n\nThere appears to be a trend towards increasing achievement at the school, with the class of 2008 achieving 150 Band 6 results in a range of subjects in the NSW Higher School Certificate. This trend has continued through to 2014, where the class achieved over 170 Band 6 results.\n\nIn 2009, Barrenjoey High School introduced the house system. Students are placed into one of the four houses in Year 7. The houses are made up in alphabetical order, according to students last name. The four houses are named Maluka (blue), Akuna (yellow), Iluka (red) and Tingara (green). Students can win 'house points' through various activities including receiving merit certificates and participating in school carnivals. But, by the end of 2018, this system had been terminated.\n\nBarrenjoey High School is actively involved in the Avalon community.

After a long career in MotoGP, for 2006 he moved to the Superbike World Championship. He returned to MotoGP for 2007, but retired by the end of the season.\n\nBarros started racing motorcycles at the age of 8, when he won on his debut in the Brazilian minibike championship. In the next two years, he was twice Brazilian moped champion. In 1981, he was the Brazilian 50cc Champion, and in 1985 he won the title of Brazilian's 250cc category. The year of 1986 saw his international début in the 80cc category—he lied about his age so he could race at the Spanish Grand Prix at the age of 15. He finished the championship in sixteenth place, scoring 6 points. In 1987, he also raced the 80cc championship, finishing seventeenth, scoring 8 points.\n\nIn 1988, Barros made his first race on the World Championship 250cc category, scoring no points. That same year, he was 3rd in the Latin American circuit of that same class. The next year, he finished 18th in the World Championship, scoring 30 points.\n\nIn 1990, Alex Barros was the youngest rider in history to join the top motorcycling category, the 500cc, at the age of 20. In his first year, he was 12th overall, with 57 points. Notable results included 8th in the United States and Germany, and 5th in the Belgium Grand Prix. Two years later, his first podium: a third place in the Netherlands.\n\nThe year of 1993 saw his breakthrough as he joined the Suzuki team. After qualifying third in the US Grand Prix, Barros had his first victory in Spain, finishing that year's world championship in sixth place. His teammate Kevin Schwantz was that year's champion. The following year, Barros scored in all but one the races. 1996 saw his best performance yet, finishing the championship at fourth, a feat he repeated in 2000, 2001 and 2002. His win at Mugello in 2001, was the latest by a rider other than Valentino Rossi until 2009. In 2002, the first of MotoGP (with engine displacement capacity increased to up to 990cc) he scored 204 points and won races in Pacific and Valencia, eleven points behind second place. 2003 was a difficult one for Barros due to injuries, but in 2004, he once again finished the championship in fourth, in a season dominated by Valentino Rossi, Sete Gibernau and Max Biaggi. In 2005, Barros returned to the top of the podium in Portugal, however he did not mount a lasting championship challenge, and was not offered a ride for 2006. He returned to MotoGP in 2007, riding a Ducati GP7 for Pramac d'Antin. In pre-season testing he matched the factory Ducatis, and at midseason he was ahead of the factory rider Loris Capirossi. He came third at Mugello (ahead of Stoner) and fourth at Istanbul Park.\n\nFor he was hired by the Klaffi Honda team in the Superbike World Championship (WSBK), paying around £100,000 of his own money to fund the ride. After a satisfactory debut weekend with two top 10 finishes, he took a pair of podium finishes at Round 2 in Phillip Island, and a second and a fourth in round four at Monza. At Brands Hatch he failed to qualify for Superpole, but bounced back from 18th on the grid to take a pair of top 10 finishes. The wet meeting at Assen was a disappointment for Barros, especially as he is a wet-weather expert.\n\nHis season was characterised by poor starts, but despite this he ended the season as the second highest Honda rider in the championship in sixth place, behind former champion James Toseland. At Imola he took his only WSBK win, and followed it with a second place in race 2.\n\nIn 1999, Barros and Japanese teammate Tadayuki Okada won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race riding a Honda RC45 superbike.\n\nPoints system from 1969 to 1987:\n\nPoints system from 1988 to 1992:\n\nPoints system from 1993 onwards:\n\n"}

The first section, from Newark west to Orange, opened on November 19, 1836. Under an agreement signed on October 21, the New Jersey Rail Road provided connecting service from Newark east to Jersey City via the Bergen Hill Cut. The original connection between the two lines was in downtown Newark; the M&E turned south on Broad Street to meet a branch of the NJRR at Market Street. Service to Paulus Hook in what is today Jersey City commenced on October 14, 1836 and passengers could transfer to the Jersey City Ferry and cross to lower Manhattan at the nearby ferry slips. \n\nOn January 1, 1838, the M&E was extended their route to Morristown. On October 29 of that year, an agreement was signed to move the NJRR connection to the foot of Centre Street (via the northeast side of Park Place, to the NJRR alignment along the Passaic River), and the track on Broad Street was removed. Through car service began August 1, 1843, with horse power used along the streets, between Broad Street station and the foot of Centre Street.\n\nContinuations opened west to Dover on July 31, 1848, Hackettstown in January 1854, and the full distance to Phillipsburg in 1866.\n\nA new alignment, including a bridge over the Passaic River, was built by the NJRR and opened on August 5, 1854, ending at East Newark Junction with the NJRR main line in Harrison. This eliminated the street running in downtown Newark; those tracks were removed the next year after a lawsuit was filed by Newark.\n\nOn March 6, 1857, a supplement to the M&E charter was passed, authorizing it to buy the new alignment (until then owned by the NJRR as their East Newark Branch) and build a new line to Jersey City, as long as it passed under Bergen Hill in a tunnel. With this authority, the M&E became important as a possible competitor to the NJRR, and began negotiations with the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The New Brunswick, Millburn and Orange Railroad was proposed as a connection between the two, allowing for a C&A route to Jersey City without using the NJRR.\n\nThe Hoboken Land and Improvement Company operated a ferry across the Hudson River between Hoboken and New York City. Until early 1859 the NJRR paid the HL&I for the business that instead used the NJRR ferry. Because of this, the HL&I decided to help the M&E by building their new alignment, using the New York and Erie Railroad's Long Dock Tunnel. To use the Erie's tunnel a supplement to their charter was needed; this was passed March 8, 1860 after arguments against the bill from the NJRR. Another legal obstacle was the NJRR's monopoly over bridges, granted to the Passaic and Hackensack Bridge Company, invalidated by the state in 1861. The first excursion train operated on the new alignment on November 14, 1862, but a contract required the M&E to continue using the NJRR until October 13, 1863. The next day, regular service began via the new alignment.\n\nOn November 1, 1865, the Atlantic and Great Western Railway leased the M&E as part of its planned route to the west. However, the A&GW went bankrupt in 1867 and the lease was cancelled. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad leased the M&E on December 10, 1868, connecting to their Warren Railroad at Washington.\nIn 1868 the Morris & Essex leased the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad, which connected Roseville Avenue to Bloomfield and Montclair, then West Bloomfield.\n\nIn 1876 the new tunnel under Bergen Hill opened, after hostilities including a frog war in late 1870 and early 1871, caused by the M&E's attempts to modify the connection between their Boonton Branch, a newer freight bypass, and the Erie tunnel.\n\nThe DL&W built the New Jersey Cut-Off, a long low-grade bypass in northwestern New Jersey, opened in 1911 from the M&E at Port Morris west to Slateford Junction just inside Pennsylvania.\n\nOn July 26, 1945 the M&E was formally merged into the DL&W. However it remained the Morris and Essex Division, and even today New Jersey Transit calls it the Morris and Essex Lines. In 1960 the DL&W merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, becoming part of Conrail in 1976.\n\n\nThe Boonton Branch was first built as a short branch from the main line at Denville east to Boonton. It was later extended much further east toward Paterson to return to the main line at the west end of Bergen Hill; this opened on September 17, 1870. A realignment was later built at the west end, bypassing Denville and some curves, for a shortcut of both the branch and the main line. In 1903 the Kingsland Tunnel opened as part of a short realignment at Kingsland. The Harrison Cut-Off was also built around this time as a connection from the Boonton Branch at Kingsland south to the main line in Kearny.\n\nThe Morris and Essex Extension Railroad was chartered in 1889 and opened later that year, connecting the Boonton Branch to Paterson.\n\nThe Newark and Bloomfield Railroad was chartered in 1852 and opened in 1855 as a short branch from the main line at Roseville Avenue/Bloomfield Junction northwest to Montclair via Bloomfield. It was built by the M&E and mostly owned by them. The M&E leased it on April 1, 1868.\n\nThe New Jersey West Line Railroad was a failed plan to build a new line across the state; only the part from Summit on the M&E west to Bernardsville was completed, and it was soon renamed the Passaic and Delaware Railroad. The DL&W leased it on November 1, 1882 as a branch of the M&E. The Passaic and Delaware Extension Railroad was chartered in 1890 and opened later that year, extending the line to Gladstone.\n\n\nThe Chester Railroad was incorporated in 1867 and opened in 1872, running from the M&E west of Dover southwest to Chester.\n\nThe short Hopatcong Railroad was a branch from the M&E at Hopatcong north to Roxbury. The DL&W bought it in 1892.\n\nThe Sussex Railroad stretched north from the M&E at Waterloo (later Stanhope) to Newton and beyond. The DL&W leased it in 1924.\n\n"}

The Shatt al-Arab is now the point where the rivers drain out, east of the Khawr Abd Allah. As it extends northwestward into Iraq, it changes its name to Khawr az-Zubayr, at the location of Umm Qasr. From this point it links by canal again to the northwest and into the Tigris and Euphrates proper. It forms the northeast coastline of Jazirat Bubiyan and the north coastline of Jazirat Warbah.

{"id": "2210343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210343", "title": "IProvo", "text": "IProvo\n\niProvo is the name of the fiber to the home service in Provo, Utah. Provo's backbone connects homes and businesses throughout the city, as well as municipal buildings, schools, power stations, and traffic signals. Construction began in July 2004 and was completed within two years. With the exception of new subdivisions not included in the original build out contract, the fiber optic backbone is available in all areas of the city. The network's fiber optic equipment is manufactured by World Wide Packets.\n\niProvo was initially operated as a public-private partnership. The city owned and maintained the fiber optic lines and fiber optic equipment, while private companies provided television, telephone, and Internet services to homes and businesses. The network had two service providers: Mstar and Nuvont Communications/Veracity Communications. In 2008, the network was sold to Broadweave Networks. Provo deemed Veracity in default on its contract to buy the network after its security deposit fell below $1.6 million. It was given to Google in 2013 for their Fiber network by the city council.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a community task force was asked to review the work of technical and business consultants and to explore whether or not the city should build a telecommunication system. After several months of study, the committee recommended that the city move forward with the project.\n\nA phased approach was proposed. Phase I would be the construction of three fiber rings throughout the city for internal city purposes. Phase II would be the Fiber to the Home demonstration project area to be launched in one Provo neighborhood. And Phase III would be a citywide deployment to every resident and business in Provo.\n\nPhase I began in 2001, followed by a successful trial period in Phase II, and a citywide build out in Phase III. By December, 2006, only five months following completion of construction, 8,400 customers had subscribed to services offered over iProvo. The number of customers reached 10,000 in September, 2007.\n\nAt the outset, the recommendations of the community task force contemplated that the city would use what has come to be known as a \"retail model.\" In this model, which is the model used by most municipal utilities across the country, the city delivers services directly to the customer.\n\nBut the retail model was challenged by incumbent providers in public settings and at the Utah State Legislature. As a result, iProvo uses what is now known as the \"wholesale model.\" Under this scenario, the city builds the network infrastructure and then opens its network to retailers, who offer services across the network.\n\nThe city considered a variety of other technology choices including wireless, broadband over power lines, and hybrid fiber-coax.\n\nFiber to the home clearly had advantages over hybrid fiber-coax, and a sharp decline in costs during the years from when the city first began to study the technology encouraged the city to build a fiber-to-the-home system. While the equipment on each end of the fiber would need to be changed out at regular intervals, studies showed that fiber technology would ensure a long-term future for the telecommunication project.\n\nThe city chose not to use wireless technologies because they are tenuous, affected by weather, and require line of sight between antennas for good connection, which is not always possible. Security was also an issue, and networks are often crowded and result in reduced bandwidth speed.\n\nA fundamental mission of the city was to build infrastructure that would be for the long term and available to all residents. The incumbent regulated carriers had communicated to the city that the Provo market was low on priority lists for receiving a fiber network. The city felt confident that if a municipally owned network was not built that it would be a number of years before fiber technology would be available to Provo.\n\nIn late 2006, the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank, issued a report characterizing iProvo as financially unstable and ineffective at lowering Internet costs or raising broadband use. Provo responded with a white paper challenging Reason's analysis and stating that any conclusions were premature since the full network had been in place for less than a year.\nIn June 2007, \"the Provo Municipal Council voted to add $1.2 million in sales tax revenue to the city's budget for the fiscal year 2008 to help iProvo pay off its debt.\" Additionally, \"[t]he city's most recent projections show that iProvo will not be self-sustaining until at least 2011\".\n\nThe Reason Foundation updated their analysis of the network on April 16, 2008, and found that iProvo's total losses are likely to exceed $10 million by the end of this fiscal year - and that figure doesn't include the $39.5 million borrowed to launch the project, most of which still needs to be paid back. The Reason Foundation report says Provo \"faces the dilemma of continuing to fund iProvo with no break-even point in sight, or it can sell and recoup as much of its investment as it can.\n\nOn May 6, 2008, Mayor Lewis Billings announced a proposed sale of the iProvo network to Broadweave Networks of Lehi, UT. This sale would allow Broadweave to be both the wholesale provider and the sole retail provider. Broadweave will purchase the network for $40.6M though a city-financed loan spread over 19 years. As part of the deal, ownership of the network reverts to the city of Provo should Broadweave become unable to make its payments on the loan. The loan is currently backed by a $6M letter of credit from Sorenson Capital but requires no up-front money on Broadweave's part.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, Broadweave Networks announced that it will buy out the current iProvo service providers.\n\nBroadweave was then acquired by Veracity networks which has run the iProvo network since then, after negotiating a series of management contracts with the city of Provo.\n\nBroadweave primarily has experience developing in new developments (\"greenfields\") whereas Provo is an \"overbuild\" or \"brownfield\" development delivering services to existing homes. Broadweave has little experience with sales and marketing since it has not been in competitive markets, something that caused the original exclusive retailer, HomeNet, to end up declaring bankruptcy.\n\nBroadweave currently has less than 1100 customers and reported around 800 customers two years ago.\n\niProvo has 10,250 customers as of April 2008, nearly 10 times what Broadweave currently serves. The company also has aggressive expansion plans with applications open in Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. It is also rumored to be purchasing the defunct OEN FTTH system in Houston. Since these are capital-intensive projects, the company runs the possibility of burning through capital too quickly and folding.\n\nPete Ashdown, owner of XMission, has alleged that the RFP process did not clearly solicit offers to buy the network. Some other residents have also complained that the process has not been subject to enough public scrutiny.\n\nAdditional criticism has focused on the fact that Provo would again be responsible for the bond debt should Broadweave fail.\n\nOn April 17, 2013, the city of Provo and Google announced that Google would acquire iProvo's existing networks and make upgrades to reach gigabit per second speeds. Approved by the city council, Provo became the third city to receive Google Fiber, following the installation and operation of Google Fiber in Kansas City (including nearby Olathe, KS) and Austin, TX.\n\nIt was revealed Google acquired iProvo for $1, and agreed in exchange for completing installation and offering free 5 Mbit/s internet service to all households or businesses for 7 years, after a $30 setup fee.\n\n"}

{"id": "2210352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210352", "title": "Ludovico di Varthema", "text": "Ludovico di Varthema\n\nLudovico di Varthema, also known as Barthema and Vertomannus (c. 1470 – 1517), was an Italian traveller, diarist and aristocrat known for being one of the first non-Muslim Europeans to enter Mecca as a pilgrim. Nearly everything that is known about his life comes from his own account of his travels, \"Itinerario de Ludouico de Varthema Bolognese,\" published in Rome in 1510.\n\nVarthema was born in Bologna. He was perhaps a soldier before beginning his distant journeys, which he undertook apparently from a passion for adventure, novelty and the fame which (then especially) attended successful exploration.\n\nVarthema left Europe near the end of 1502. Early in 1503, he reached Alexandria and ascended the Nile to Cairo. From Egypt, he sailed to Beirut and thence travelled to Tripoli, Aleppo and Damascus, where he managed to get himself enrolled, under the name of \"Yunas\" (Jonah), in the Mamluk garrison.\n\nFrom Damascus, Varthema made the journey to Mecca and Medina as one of the Mamluk escorts of a \"Hajj\" pilgrim caravan (April–June 1503). He describes the sacred cities of Islam and the chief pilgrim sites and ceremonies with remarkable accuracy, almost all his details being confirmed by later writers. Varthema may very well have been the first non-Muslim European to visit these cities.\n\nWhile in Mecca, Varthema was confronted by a Muslim overseas merchant, who accused him of being a Christian spy. When Varthema protested that he was a Mamluk, the suspicions were allayed. The merchant explained to Varthema that nerves were on edge on account of the activities of the Portuguese, who had recently begun encroaching on the Indian Ocean and attacking Muslim shipping. (The massacre of the passengers of a Mecca pilgrim ship by Vasco da Gama in 1502 had been particularly shocking, although this event is not explicitly referred to by Varthema).\n\nHearing these stories, Varthema conceived of a ruse to get to India. Varthema presented himself as a master cannon founder, seeking to offer his services to the Muslim Sultan of Bijapur (\"King of the Deccan\"), to cast artillery to fight the Portuguese. Impressed by Varthema's resolution, the overseas Meccan merchant hid Varthema in his home, and the Mamluk escort returned to Syria without him.\n\nWith the Meccan merchant's assistance, Ludovico de Varthema embarked an Arab merchant vessel at Jeddah, a city-port around 80 km west to Mecca, destined for India. It sailed down the Red Sea and through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to Aden. However, upon reaching Aden, he was arrested and imprisoned as a Christian spy. He was accused of being a crew member of some Portuguese ships that had been preying on Arab shipping nearby (probably a reference to the squadron of Vicente Sodré, which was prowling the Gulf of Aden around this time.)\nBy his own account, Varthema gained his liberty after imprisonment both at Aden and Radaa because of a love affair with one of the sultanas of Yemen. The sultana kept him in her palace at Radaa for a while. Eventually, feigning a malady, Varthema secured the sultana's permission to leave Radaa to seek out a cure with a specialist in Aden. He subsequently took a tour through south-west Arabia (visiting San‘a’), before finally returning to Aden again.\n\nProbably using the sultana's cash gift, Varthema purchased passage on an Arab ship for India. By now it was March 1504. The ship was supposed to make a stop in the Persian Gulf first, but contrary winds forced it in the opposite direction, and it ended up having to sail south instead, calling in at Zeila and Berbera (on the coast of Somalia). He gives brief descriptions of both places.\n\nFrom Somalia, the ship proceeded to sail across the Arabian Sea to the Indian port of Diu in Gujarat. From Diu, it sailed up the Gulf of Cambay to Gogo. Business done there, the ship sailed back across the Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf. The ship made landfall at Julfar, on the other side of Cape Mussandam at the entrance to the gulf, then doubled back over the cape to make a brief stop in Muscat, before proceeding across the strait to Ormuz.\n\nArriving in Ormuz in the aftermath of a palace coup, Ludovico de Varthema did not linger for long, but proceeded to cross to mainland Persia. He seems to have traveled northeast across Persia to Herat (twelve days journey from Hormuz), and then returned southwest to Shiraz (twenty-three days). Along the way, he passed a river which he (erroneously) identifies as the Euphrates (it is probably the Pulvar River)\n\nIn Shiraz, Varthema came by chance across a Persian merchant whom he had met earlier in Mecca. The Persian merchant, named \"Cazazioner\" in the chronicle (probably an Italianization of \"Khwaja Junair\" in original Persian), entered into a partnership with Varthema, whom he still called \"Yunus\" and believed was a Muslim. The two would remain together for the remainder of Varthema's travels in Asia. It seems clear that Varthema was the junior partner in the arrangement, and that Cazazioner was also cultivating him as a future son-in-law. The subsequent itinerary was primarily set by Cazazioner's commercial interests, with Varthema accompanying him through his routine trade stops.\n\nLudovico de Varthema and his new Persian partner joined an overland caravan to Samarkand, but the expedition was called off part-way\nupon news of disturbances in the area. Varthema refers to the Shi'ite Safavid rising, which had spread into northern Iran around this time. The caravan returned to Shiraz.\n\nWith the overland route closed by war, Ludovico de Varthema and his Persian partner proceeded from Shiraz down to Ormuz, where they took ship for India. They made call at the mouth of the Indus River. From there, Varthema and his Persian partner sailed down the west coast of India. This cruise began around October 1504.\n\nTheir first stop was the bustling port of Cambay, in modern Gujarat. Varthema gives a vivid description of the Sultan of Cambay and a garbled description of Jains and Yogi ascetics. They then proceeded south, making stops at Chaul and Dabul, before reaching Goa. From Goa, Varthema and his partner made a seven-day excursion inland to Bijapur, capital of the Deccan sultanate of Adil Khan. Returning to the coast and boarding ship again, they continued south, making stops at Ankala, Honavar, Bhatkal and Mangalore, most of them tributary ports of the inland Hindu kingdom of Vijaynagara (confusingly, in the sequence of his account, Varthema places Bhatkal before Ankola; it is probable he confused Karwar with Bhatkal).\n\nThey then reach Cannanore, the first of the major Malabari city-states in Kerala, notionally subject to the Zamorin. At Cannanore, Varthema may have seen the first Portuguese, who had a factory in the city, but apparently refrained from interacting with them, perhaps out of fear of being revealed. From Cannanore, Varthema and his partner took an overland journey of fifteen days to the interior city of Vijayanagara, capital of the eponymous Hindu empire. He briefly interrupts his travelogue at this point to describe war elephants and coinage of south India. It is probably around December 1504 now.\n\nReturning to the coast, Varthema and his partner boarded ship again and proceeded down the Malabar Coast, making stops at the small ports of Dharmapattanam, Pandarane (Pantalayani, now Koyilandy) and Kappad (Capogatto) before finally reaching the great city of Calicut, seat of the Zamorin and the major spice emporium on the Malabar Coast. However, a naval trade blockade imposed on Calicut by the Portuguese had thinned the local markets, disappointing the business Varthema and his Persian partner had expected to conduct there. If the dating is correct (early January, 1505), Kerala was still smoldering in the aftermath of the hard-fought Battle of Cochin, and the most recent Portuguese armada was still in the vicinity.\n\nAt this point, Varthema breaks the narrative to describe Calicut in much detail. He gives an account of the Zamorin's court, government, the administration of justice and military. He describes the topography, economy, trade and navigation of the city, and gives an overview of the manners and customs of Malabari society. This chapter contains one of the earliest European descriptions of Hindu religion and the caste system. Nowhere do Varthema's observing power show themselves more strikingly, if still somewhat quaint and mistaken in some details.\n\nVarthema and his Persian partner resumed their trip southwards via the inner lagoons and rivers of the Kerala backwaters rather than by the sea coast, possibly to elude Portuguese naval patrols. They skipped past Cochin, where the Portuguese had their strongest presence at the time, and sailed via the backwaters far as \"Cacolon\" (probably Kayamkulam). It is here where Varthema first encounters Saint Thomas Christians. Continuing on, they soon reached the major commercial city of Quilon, but as the ruler was a Portuguese ally, they did not linger there, but continued on quickly, now sailing by the coast again.\n\nThe ship carrying Varthema and his Persian partner rounded Cape Comorin (southern tip of India) and followed the coast northeast. They made a stop at the small port of \"Chayl\" (exact location uncertain but assumed to be one of the pearl fishery ports in the environs of Tuticorin). They proceeded on to a large port city that Varthema calls \"Cioromandel\", which seems to correspond to Negapatam, a vassal city of Vijayanagara on the Coromandel Coast of India.\n\nVarthema and his Persian partner stopped advancing further up the coast, as there were reports of war breaking out in the area. Instead, they took a ship with some other merchants across the Palk Strait to the island of Ceylon. His exact landing is unclear. His description is consistent with Colombo (in the westerly Kingdom of Kotte), but the speed of his journey makes it likelier to be northerly Jaffna. He gives a brief description of the island, the rivalry of its four kingdoms, and its cinnamon plantations. Their stay here was cut short after Cazazioner got entangled in the intrigues of a local Arab merchant. They set sail back to India, arriving three days later at Pulicat, another Vijayanagara subject city on the Coromandel coast.\n\nFrom Pulicat, Varthema and his Persian partner sailed straight east across the Bay of Bengal and, after fourteen days (c. March 1505), reached Tenasserim (on the upper Malay peninsula, now part of Burma, but then part of the Ayutthaya Kingdom of Thailand). Varthema pauses the narrative to give a description of Tenasserim, its military, administration, economy, and society. He refers to distinctly-dressed groups of \"Brahmins\" in the city (probably a reference to Buddhist monks, Varthema not quite realizing the distinction between them ). It is also here that Varthema first witnesses and describes the funerary ritual of \"Sati\". In one eyebrow-raising episode, Varthema reports that a local merchant invited them to sleep with his new wife, explaining it was the \"custom\" of the land to invite strangers to deflower virgin brides. Cazazioner dutifully took up the request.\n\nAfter a few weeks in Tennasserim, Varthema and his Persian partner proceeded to sail northwest to Bengal. After eleven days sailing, they arrived at a port that Varthema called \"Benghalla\", at the mouth of the Ganges River. The identification of the port of \"Benghalla\" on the Ganges delta is unclear. It has been alternatively suggested it refer to Satgaon, Chittagong, perhaps more likely, Sonargaon.\nIn Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fernão Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\nThe two Chinese Christians persuaded Varthema and his partner Cazazioner to accompany them. They all took a ship together from Bengal across the bay to Pegu (lower Burma). Hearing that the best potential customer for their wares, the King of Pegu, was on campaign against the Ava Kingdom (upper Burma), the party set off on a boat up the Irrawaddy River, but soon gave up, and returned to Pegu to await him there. The king arrived a few days later, and granted them an audience. With the two Chinese Christians as translators, Cazizioner and Varthema, exercising their best negotiating skills, sold the monarch some relatively modest red coral in exchange for a fortune in high-value Burmese rubies (in an earlier passage, Varthema identifies the source of rubies to be \"Capellan\", a common name for the ruby-mining district of upper Burma.)\n\nFrom Pegu, Varthema, his Persian partner and the two Chinese Christians took a ship down the Malay peninsula to Malacca, the major commercial entrepot of the region. They did not, however, stay in Malacca long, and soon crossed over the strait to Sumatra. They called in at the port city of Pedir (then a major commercial center and capital of a northeast Sumatran sultanate, Pedir was subsequently annexed by the Aceh Sultanate and has since declined into insignificance) Varthema describes the abundance of long pepper and variety of perfumed woods that was available at Pedir.\n\nAt this point, the two Chinese Christians expressed a desire to return home to Sarnau, and hearing that Varthema had been born a Christian, sought to persuade him to come with them and resume his old faith. But Varthema declined, saying he wished to remain a Muslim convert. His Persian partner, Cazizioner, expressed his wish to visit the famed Spice Islands and see for himself the source of cloves and nutmeg, the glorious spices, and prevailed on the two Chinese Christians to join them. A pair of local \"sampans\" (flat-bottomed boats) were procured and they proceeded to sail east, weaving through the Indonesian islands, and after fifteen days, reached the Banda Islands, the world's only source of nutmeg. From there, they sailed north for another twelve days and reached the clove islands of the Moluccas (which Varthema calls \"Monoch\"). Ludovico de Varthema may very well have been the first European to set eyes on these islands (the Portuguese would only find them in 1512). He comments extensively on the cultivation of the spices and their prices.\n\nThe Moluccas was the furthest eastward point reached by Varthema and his Persian partner. It was by now around June 1505. Guided by the two Chinese Christians, they returned via a different route, first proceeding to Borneo to charter a larger ship, then headed south to Java, the \"largest island in the world\", according to the Chinese Christians (Java is, in fact, smaller than Borneo).\n\nVarthema observed that the Malay pilot of their vessel used a magnetic compass and nautical chart gridded with lines. Although sailing by compass and chart was common in the Mediterranean, it was unusual in the Indian Ocean, where celestial navigation was the norm, and perplexed Varthema's Persian partner. The Malay pilot also showed them how he used the Southern Cross to navigate, another novelty for both of them. In a cryptic comment, the Malay pilot curiously refers to some supposed \"Far Southern lands\" (which some historians have interpreted to be a reference to the Australian coast).\n\nThe journey from Borneo to Java took five days. It is unclear where in Java they landed. Varthema makes some quick observations about the island (notably, the prevalence of Hinduism, unlike the Islam they consistently encountered in other ports). In a dubious passage, Varthema claims that a substantial part of the Javanese population engaged in cannibalism. Staying in Java for a couple of weeks, they decided it was time to resume their return journey. Before leaving, Varthema purchased some emeralds as well as buying two castrated young children.\n\nChartering a junk (\"giunco\") from Java, they made their way back to Malacca, where Varthema and Cazizioner finally parted company with the two Chinese Christians. On the same Javanese junk, they proceeded west across the Bay of Bengal, fifteen days sailing, to the Coromandel Coast of India, and disembarked at Negapatam. After a few weeks, they took a sampan to Quilon. The presence of some Portuguese in Quilon frightened Varthema, and he kept a low profile until he found passage, again via the Kerala backwaters, back to Calicut.\n\nIn Calicut, Ludovico de Varthema came across two Italians - Varthema gives their names as Pier'Antonio and Gian'Maria, and identifies them as Milanese (Portuguese sources identify them as Venetian agents). They were military engineers that the Zamorin had hired to cast European-style artillery to fight the Portuguese. Temporarily separated from his Persian partner, and overcome by homesickness, Varthema revealed himself to them as a Christian and a compatriot. The two Italians, who had arrived in India in 1502, expressed their desire to return home, but that the Zamorin would not let them go. Learning that the next Portuguese armada was due to arrive in India soon (estimated September 1505), Varthema made up his mind to meet with the Portuguese captains and secure them all passage back to Europe. However, the two Italians doubted the Portuguese would pardon them.\n\nWhile staying in Calicut, Varthema continued meet with his new Italian friends. To allay the suspicions of his Persian partner, Varthema conjured up a ruse, professing a spiritual awakening had convinced him to embrace a more stringent religious life. For the next few weeks, Varthema lived as a Muslim ascetic in a Calicut mosque (albeit stealing away at night to join the Italians for dinner). His portrayal as a holy man was sufficiently convincing that he was even sought out as a healer.\n\nAt length, news reached Calicut that the Portuguese armada had finally arrived in Cannanore. It was by now late October or early November 1505 (Varthema mistakenly reports early September). Varthema arranged to leave for Cannanore with some Persian merchants. Their ship, however, was stopped in the harbor by the Calicut authorities and prevented from leaving. But the party eventually managed to sneak aboard a smaller vessel and finally made their way there. Cazizioner did not accompany them, but gave Varthema a letter of introduction to a merchant friend in Cannanore. Varthema would not see his old Persian partner again.\n\nAfter a few days, Ludovico de Varthema slipped away from his Persian hosts in Cannanore, and presented himself to the Portuguese authorities, revealing himself a Christian. Varthema was taken to Fort Sant' Angelo of Cannanore, and for the next three days, was personally interviewed by the Portuguese naval captain D. Lourenço de Almeida. Varthema supplied Almeida with the particulars of the Zamorin's military and naval preparations, as he had observed during his stay in Calicut. Almeida dispatched Varthema, and his report, on a ship to Cochin, to his father, D. Francisco de Almeida, the Portuguese vice-roy in India. Delighted by the intelligence provided, Almeida received Varthema warmly. At Varthema's request, Almeida consented to give the two Italian engineers in Calicut a safe-conduct, and sent Varthema back to Cannanore, along with instructions for his son Lourenço to give him all necessary assistance. Varthema tapped into the local spy network to communicate with the Italians in Calicut. But it ended in failure. The plan to spring them out of Calicut was overheard by a slave and revealed. Before the Zamorin's authorities could arrest them, an enraged mob descended, seized and killed the two Italians. Varthema received the news in Cannanore in March 1506.\n\nLater that same month (March 1506), Varthema witnessed the naval Battle of Cannanore between Zamorin's fleet and the Portuguese fleet of Lourenço de Almeida, which he describes in some detail. Shortly after, Varthema was hired by the Portuguese factory in Cannanore to help the Portuguese authorities enforce their strict new shipping restrictions on the Malabar Coast (the \"cartaz\" system). Varthema used his Arabic language skills to interrogate local captains of merchant vessels traveling with suspect licenses.\n\nLudovico de Varthema remained in this position for around a year and a half. He was huddled among the defenders during the desperate Siege of Cannanore, that lasted from April to August 1507, when they were finally rescued by the arriving armada of D. Tristão da Cunha. He claims that after the battle, some of his old acquaintances became Christian converts. Varthema subsequently joined a punitive Portuguese raid led by Cunha on the Calicut-allied port of Ponnani in November. For his exploits there, Ludovico de Varthema was knighted by the viceroy Francisco de Almeida in Cochin, with Tristão da Cunha standing as his sponsor.\n\nLudovico de Varthema left India on 6 December 1507, departing from Cannanore, aboard the Portuguese return armada. He sailed aboard the \"São Vicente\", a ship owned by Bartolomeo Marchionni, a Florentine merchant in Lisbon. They followed the usual return route, crossing the Indian Ocean, and then sailing down the East African coast. Their first, and apparently only stop, was Mozambique Island. Although Varthema refers to various other points along the Swahili Coast (e.g. Malindi, Mombassa, Kilwa) it does not seem (and it would not have been likely) that he saw them personally, but was merely reporting them second-hand from the Portuguese. Varthema may however have seen Pemba and the Comoros from the distance.\n\nVarthema gives a brief description of Mozambique Island, including the native Bantu inhabitants on the mainland. He mentions the new Portuguese fortress which was under construction on the island (Fort São Gabriel, begun by captain Vasco Gomes de Abreu in late 1507). Varthema refers to Francisco de Almeida's raids of 1505 and Tristão da Cunha's jaunt to Madagascar over the winter of 1506-07 and in a personal aside, expresses hope that all of Asia will eventually become Christian.\n\nAfter a brief period of recovery, the journey was resumed. The fleet sailed down the Mozambique Channel and then rounded the Cape of Good Hope from the east. They were hit shortly after by a storm which dispersed the fleet, and the \"São Vicente\" sailed on alone. Varthema reports they passed near the islands of Saint Helena and Ascension in the south Atlantic. After crossing the equator, they alighted in the Azores islands, where they stopped for a couple of days for refreshment. They reached Lisbon about a week later.\n\nShortly after arriving, Ludovico de Varthema sought out an audience with the Portuguese king Manuel I in Almada, to confirm the patent of knighthood he received in India. That done, Ludovico de Varthema proceeded back to Rome, Italy. He gives no further details, his travelogue ending here.\n\nAs Richard Francis Burton said in his book \"The Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah\":\nVarthema's work \"\"Itinerario de Ludouico de Varthema Bolognese\"\" was first published in Italian at Rome in 1510. Other Italian editions appeared at Rome, 1517, at Venice, 1518, 1535, 1563, 1589, etc., at Milan, 1519, 1523, 1525. Latin translations appeared at Milan, 1511 (by Archangelus Madrignanus); and at Nuremberg, 1610. The book has been translated into 50 languages.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210361", "title": "Participating preferred stock", "text": "Participating preferred stock\n\nParticipating preferred stock is preferred stock that provides a specific dividend that is paid before any dividends are paid to common stock holders, and that takes precedence over common stock in the event of a liquidation. This form of financing is used by private equity investors and venture capital (VC) firms. Holders of participating preferred stock have the choice between two payoffs: a liquidation preference or an optional conversion. In a liquidation, they first get their money back at the original purchase price, the balance of any proceeds is then shared between common and participating preferred stock as though all convertible stock was converted. In an optional conversion, all shares are converted into common stock. Holders of participating preferred stock will always pick the option with the highest payoff.\n\nIn a liquidation, participating shares distribute the remaining assets with common stock pro rata. Pro rata means as a function of number of common shares on an as converted basis. The remaining proceeds are distributed based on ownership.\n\nLike common stock, preferred stocks represent partial ownership in a company. Preferred stock shareholders may or may not enjoy any of the voting rights of those holding common stock. Also, unlike common stock, a preferred stock pays a fixed dividend that does not fluctuate. Often the dividend is cumulative. Thus, the company must pay all unpaid preferred dividends accumulated during previous periods before it can pay dividends to common shareholders. If the company is unable to pay this dividend, the preferred shareholders may have the right to force a liquidation of the company. If the dividend is not cumulative, preferred shares are not paid a dividend until the board of directors approves of a dividend.\n\nParticipation in liquidations in venture capital fundraising has slowly come out of trend. In the second quarter of 2017, financings that provided participation made up only 13% down from 25% in Q3 2015. When participating, entrepreneurs have the option to set a cap on participation. This means after liquidation, holders of participating preferred shares can have a payout up to a certain multiplier of their initial purchase price. In Q2 2017, 69% of financings had no cap on participation.\n\nParticipating preferred is often used as a \"bridge\" between a company that desires a higher valuation and a VC that believes in a lower valuation. A VC will agree to a higher valuation if it is accompanied by a participating preferred security—essentially challenging the company to earn the upside of the higher valuation. Participating shares give a VC the best potential upside as they can freely choose from liquidation or an optional conversion.\n\nThe main benefit of owning preferred stock is that the investor has a greater claim on the company's assets than common stockholders. Preferred shareholders always receive their dividends first and, in the event the company goes bankrupt, preferred shareholders are paid off before the holders of common stock. In general, there are five different types of preferred stock: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative, participating, convertible, and callable.\n"}
{"id": "2210372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210372", "title": "Cat sìth", "text": "Cat sìth\n\nThe Cat Sìth () or Cat Sidhe (, Cat Sí in new orthography) is a fairy creature from Celtic mythology, said to resemble a large black cat with a white spot on its chest. Legend has it that the spectral cat haunts the Scottish Highlands. The legends surrounding this creature are more common in Scottish folklore, but a few occur in Irish. Some common folklore suggested that the \"Cat Sìth\" was not a fairy, but a witch that could transform into a cat nine times.\n\nThe Cat Sìth may have been inspired by the Scottish wildcat itself. It is possible that the legends of the \"Cat Sìth\" were inspired by Kellas cats, which are a distinctive hybrid between Scottish wildcats and domestic cats only found in Scotland (the Scottish wildcat is a subspecies of the European wildcat, which is absent from elsewhere in the British Isles).\n\nThe Cat Sìth is all black with the exception of a white spot on its chest. It is described as being as large as a dog and chooses to display itself with its back arched and bristles erect.\n\nIn the British folk tale \"The King of the Cats\", a man comes home to tell his wife and cat, Old Tom, that he saw nine black cats with white spots on their chests carrying a coffin with a crown on it, and one of the cats tells the man to \"Tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum is dead.\" The cat then exclaims, \"What?! Old Tim dead! Then I'm the King o' the Cats!\" Old Tom then climbs up the chimney and is never seen again.\n\nThe people of the Scottish Highlands did not trust the Cat Sìth. They believed that it could steal a person's soul, before it was claimed by the gods, by passing over a corpse before burial; therefore watches called the \"Feill Fadalach\" (Late Wake) were performed night and day to keep the Cat Sìth away from a corpse before burial. Methods of \"distraction\" such as games of leaping and wrestling, catnip, riddles, and music would be employed to keep the Cat Sìth away from the room in which the corpse lay. In addition, there were no fires where the body lay, as it was said that the Cat Sìth was attracted to the warmth.\n\nOn Samhain, it was believed that a Cat Sìth would bless any house that left a saucer of milk out for it to drink, and those houses that did not let out a saucer of milk would be cursed into having all of their cows' milk dry.\n\nThere was also a practice called Taghaim where they believed that the demonic Cat Sith called Big Ears would appear and grant any wish to those who took part in the ceremony. The ceremony required practitioners to burn the bodies of cats over the course of four days and nights.\n\nSome people believed that the Cat Sìth was a witch that could transform voluntarily into its cat form and back nine times. If one of these witches chose to go back into their cat form for the ninth time, they would remain a cat for the rest of their lives.

She was awarded the Israel Prize for literature in 2000.\n\nAmalia Kahana-Carmon was born in Kibbutz Ein Harod on October 18, 1926. She moved to Tel Aviv as a child and studied at Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, but her studies were interrupted by the 1948 Palestine war where she served in the Negev Brigade of Palmach as a signals operator and wrote the famous telegram for the capture of Eilat. Upon her return from military service, Kahana-Carmon attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and studied library science and philology. Soon after graduating, she moved to Switzerland (1951 to 1955) and then to England (1955 to 1957) before moving back to Tel Aviv to work as a librarian and writer.\n\nKahana-Carmon’s father, Chaim Kahana (1890-1910), immigrated to Palestine in 1910. In Palestine, he received a rabbinical education and both invented and held consultations for technical mechanisms.  Her mother, Sara Crispin (1903-1985), was born in Bulgaria and attended the Hebrew Teachers Seminary in Bulgaria before immigrating to Palestine in 1922 where she studied bee-keeping at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. Crispin spent the rest of her life as a bee-keeper and Hebrew teacher. Kahana-Carmon had one younger sister named Miriam (b. 1929). While Kahana-Carmon was in London in 1951, she met and married an Israeli student named Arie Carmon, who studied civil engineering. They had three children together–Raya (b. 1953), Iddo (b. 1956), and Haggai (b. 1959)–before divorcing in 1978.\n\nKahana-Carmon began writing in the 1950s but is not considered to be part of the Palmah Generation, a movement that dominated the literary scene in the 1940s and 1950s, nor the Generation of Statehood, a counter-movement to the Palmah Generation. Her writing differed from these groups in an important way: it centered around the individual rather than national ideals. This does not mean that Kahana-Carmon was not influenced by others; in fact, her writing was shaped by Nehamah Pukhachewsky (1869-1934), who wrote about the struggles of women pioneers in Palestine, and Devorah Baron (1886-1956), who wrote about the victimization of women in male-dominated religious Jewish institutions. Many also believe that Kahana-Carmon’s writing was influenced by Virginia Woolf because of their shared lyrical, poetic style, but Kahana-Carmon commented that this relation was due to similarity in thought rather than any influence.\n\nDuring Kahana-Carmon’s time, authors who explored national ideals, usually represented by men's lives, were valued over those who focused on the individual or women’s experiences. Typically when women were mentioned, they were used as metaphors for the land of Israel.  Consequently, women’s writing, which more often than not centered around women’s experiences, was pushed to the periphery. Kahana-Carmon’s writing was no exception to this. That being said, Kahana-Carmon believed that all writers were outsiders, not because of social rejection but because others were incapable of understanding their commitment to their crafts.\n\nMany have tried to translate Kahana-Carmon’s writing, but she rejected their attempts, believing that her work was untranslatable. There are still a few translations that do exist, including \"With Her on Her Way Home\", translated into Italian and Chinese, and \"Bridal Veil\", in G. Abramson’s (ed.) \"Oxford Book of Hebrew Short Stories\" (1996) and R. Domb’s (ed.) \"New Women’s Writing from Israel\" (1996).\n\nKahana-Carmon writes about the lives of traditional women in male-dominated environments before marriage, during war, or during university years using a lyrical style that explores the depths of her characters’ emotions. Most of Kahana-Carmon’s writing focuses on one mundane event, and the descriptions are a reflection on that event, allowing the reader to peer into the inner world of the characters. Generally, this reflection does not lead to a solution, but the characters experience freedom from understanding their situations.\n\nMany of Kahana-Carmon’s characters experience romantic feelings, but often the object of these emotions is in a different social circle or the characters are in the wrong place at the wrong time, so they cannot be together. Despite their romantic defeats, her heroines emerge as queens who recognize what they have lost but continue to have hope. She challenges the happily-ever-after paradigm but still believes in the dignifying aspects of love.\n\nFurthermore, Kahana-Carmon’s characters are outsiders in their societies because of their genders, classes, or races. Some of them even cross gender and race boundaries, such as in \"Up in Montifer\". In this novella, Clara, the heroine, has a black, freed slave as her companion. She reaches independence as a merchant through dialogue with this freed slave, where both characters are gender and race conscious.\n\nKahana-Carmon also wrote feminist critiques of Israeli literature and culture.  These essays were inspired by a trip to America where she attended an international meeting for writers and was introduced to Frantz Fanon (1925-1961), who wrote postcolonial criticisms about race relations. She was also inspired by gender critiques from Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986).\n\n\n\n"}

The design is an attempt to clarify certain difficult aspects common to most prescription bottles used in the US.\n\nBottles have a distinctive rounded-wedge shape and are designed to stand on their caps, with the label folding over the top of the bottle, where the name of the drug is printed in large print for easy identification. A cutout on the back of the bottle includes space for a data card describing the effects and risks of the medication. Fundamental to the design is a colored rubber ring that serves as a color code so different members of a household can distinguish their individual prescriptions. An overall priority is given to distinguishability; the most important information (patient name, drug name, instructions) are placed prominently on the upper half of the label. Other innovations include revised warning symbols and labels and a small magnifying strip that can be inserted into the side of the bottle for customers with visual impairments.\n\nLiquid medicine bottles are not quite as distinctive, but feature a spill proof cap coupled with a dosing syringe that is claimed to be more accurate than spoon dispensing.

{"id": "2210395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210395", "title": "Khor Fakkan", "text": "Khor Fakkan\n\nKhor Fakkan () is a city and exclave of the Emirate of Sharjah, located on the east coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), facing the Gulf of Oman, and geographically surrounded by the Emirate of Fujairah. The city, the second largest on the east coast after Fujairah City, is set on the bay of Khor Fakkan, which means \"Creek of Two Jaws\". It is the site of Khor Fakkan Container Terminal, the only natural deep-sea port in the region and one of the major container ports in the UAE.\n\nKhorfakkan has a long history of human settlement. There is evidence of post holes from the wooden uprights of the traditional barasti huts known as \"areesh\", similar to those found at Tell Abraq which dates from the 3rd to 1st millienium BC. Excavations by a team from the Sharjah Archaeological Museum have identified 34 graves and a settlement belonging to the early-mid 2nd millennium BC. These are clustered on rock outcrops overlooking the harbour.\n\nAround 1500, Duarte Barbosa described it as a village “around which are gardens and farms in plenty”. The town was captured by the Portuguese Empire in the 16th century and was referred to as Corfacão. It was part of a serial of fortified cities that the Portugal had to control the access to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, like Khor Fakan, Muscat, Sohar, Seeb, Qurayyat and Muttrah. The settlement, located on the east coast of the Musandam peninsula, south of the Gulf of Oman, was a tributary of the kingdom of Hormuz. At the dawn of the 16th century, it and its port were defended by a wide walled belt facing the land, closing the gorge that, in the mountain range parallel to the coast, allows communication with the interior. In this monumental structure a single door was torn, defended by a tower. The ensemble was responsible for safeguarding eventual tribal attacks.\n\nIn 1580 the Venetian jeweler Gasparo Balbi noted \"Chorf\" in a list of places on the east coast of the United Arab Emirates, which is considered by historians to indicate Khor Fakkan. The Portuguese built a fort at Khor Fakkan that was a ruin by 1666. The log book of the Dutch vessel the \"Meerkat\" mentions this fort and another one, describing \"Gorfacan\" as a place on a small bay, with about 200 small houses built from date branches, near the beach. It refers to a triangular Portuguese fortress on the northern side, in ruins, and a fortress on a hill on the southern side, also in ruins, without garrison or artillery. As well as date palms, the \"Meerkat\"s log also mentions fig trees, melons, watermelons and myrrh. It notes several wells with \"good and fresh water\" used for irrigation.\n\nOne reason suggested for the ruinous state of the forts is an invasion in 1623 of the Persian navy under the control of Omani Sheikh Muhammad Suhari. Suhari, facing a Portuguese counter-attack, withdrew to the Portuguese forts, including that of Khorfakkan. When the Persians were expelled, the Portuguese commander Rui Freire urged the people of Khorfakkan to remain loyal to the Portuguese crown and established a Portuguese customs office as well.\n\nIn 1737, long after the Portuguese had been expelled from Arabia, the Persians again invaded Khor Fakkan, with some 5,000 men and 1,580 horses, with the help of the Dutch, during their intervention in the Omani civil war. In 1765 Khor Fakkan belonged to a sheikh of the Al Qasimi, Sharjah's ruling family, according to the German traveler Carsten Niebuhr. There is a map by the French cartographer Rigobert Bonne dating to about 1770 that shows the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf and includes Khor Fakkan.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, Lorimer notes that Khor Fakkan had about 5,000 date trees and was home to about 150 houses of Naqbiyin and Arabicised Persians, amounting to some 800 people. The population lived by cultivation and pearling and the town had seven shops.\n\nThe German submarine U-533 sank about off the coast on 16 October 1943 during World War II. Divers found the wreck at a depth of in 2009.\n\nThe modern Khor Fakkan Container Terminal was inaugurated in 1979, and is the only natural deep-sea port in the region, and one of the top ports in the Emirates for containers. The Dh 300 million ($81.75 million) project involved reclaiming some to increase the storage capacity and to facilitate large cranes, and deep quays to accommodate for major vessels over in length. As of 2004 it handled 1.6 million TEU's.\n\nKhor Fakkan lies on the east coast of the UAE, between the Indian Ocean and the \"Shumayliyyah\" or Western Hajar Mountains. The bay of Khor Fakkan is north-east facing and is protected from prevailing winds by a jetty serving the container terminal. Tourism is well developed thanks to sandy beaches and the coral reefs that attract many divers. Khor Fakkan Beach lies to the north of the centre of the town.\n\nFrom November to April Khor Fakkan is sunny and warm during the day; the evenings are cool and humidity low. Daytime temperatures range from . One may expect rain and tropical storms between January and March. The climate warms from May to September with the high temperature at noon in July and August reaching . The nights too are warm, with the temperature reaching , with high humidity.\n\nKhor Fakkan has one 4 star holiday beach resort, the Oceanic Hotel. The fish, fruit and vegetable \"souq\" is located at the southern end of the \"corniche\" and near the main highway.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210398", "title": "Chrysopelea", "text": "Chrysopelea\n\nChrysopelea, more commonly known as the flying snake or gliding snake, is a genus that belongs to the family Colubridae. Flying snakes are mildly venomous, though the venom is dangerous only to their small prey. Their range is in Southeast Asia (the mainland (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), Greater and Lesser Sundas, Maluku, and the Philippines), southernmost China, India, and Sri Lanka.\n\n\"Chrysopelea\" is also known by its common name \"flying snake.\" It climbs using ridge scales along its belly, pushing against rough bark surface of tree trunks, allowing it to move vertically up a tree. Upon reaching the end of a branch, the snake continues moving until its tail dangles from the end of the branch. It then makes a J-shape bend, leans forward to select the level of inclination it wishes to use to control its glide path, as well as selecting a desired landing area. Once it decides on a destination, it propels itself by thrusting its body up and away from the tree, sucking in its abdomen and flaring out its ribs to turn its body into a \"pseudo concave wing\", all the while making a continual serpentine motion of lateral undulation parallel to the ground to stabilise its direction in midair in order to land safely.\n\nThe combination of forming a C-shape, flattening its abdomen and making a motion of lateral undulation in the air makes it possible for the snake to glide in the air, where it also manages to save energy compared to travel on the ground and dodge earth-bound predators. The concave wing that the snake creates in flattening itself, flattens its body to up to twice its width from the back of the head to the anal vent, which is close to the end of the snake's tail, causes the cross section of the snake's body to resemble the cross section of a frisbee or flying disc. When a flying disc spins in the air, the designed cross sectional concavity causes increased air pressure under the centre of the disc, causing lift for the disc to fly. The snake continuously moves in lateral undulation to create the same effect of increased air pressure underneath its arched body to glide. Flying snakes are able to glide better than flying squirrels and other gliding animals, despite the lack of limbs, wings, or any other wing-like projections, gliding through the forest and jungle it inhabits with the distance being as great as 100 m. Their destination is mostly predicted by ballistics; however, they can exercise some in-flight attitude control by \"slithering\" in the air.\n\nTheir ability to glide has been an object of interest for physicists and the United States Department of Defense in recent years, and studies continue to be made on what other, more subtle, factors contribute to their gliding. According to recent research conducted by the University of Chicago, scientists discovered a negative correlation between size and gliding ability, in which smaller flying snakes were able to glide longer distances horizontally.\n\nAccording to research performed by Professor Jake Socha at Virginia Tech, these snakes can change the shape of their body in order to produce aerodynamic forces so they can glide in the air. Scientists are hopeful that this research will lead to the design of robots that can glide in the air from one place to another.\n\nThe species is considered mildly venomous, with a few confirmed cases of medically significant envenomation. Chrysopelea species are not included in lists of snakes considered venomous to man. \n\n\"Chrysopelea\" are diurnal, which means they hunt during the day. They prey upon lizards, rodents, frogs, birds, and bats.\n\nThere are five recognized species of flying snake, found from western India to the Indonesian archipelago. Knowledge of their behavior in the wild is limited, but they are thought to be highly arboreal, rarely descending from the canopy. The smallest species reach about in length and the largest grow to .\n\nTheir diets are variable depending on their range, but they are known to eat rodents, lizards, frogs, birds, and bats. They are mildly venomous snakes, but their tiny, fixed rear fangs make them harmless to humans.\n\nGolden tree snake or ornate flying snake, \"Chrysopelea ornata\" : This is the largest species of flying snake, reaching up to four feet in length. Though it is called the golden tree snake, there are other colour variations; for example, some phases tend to lean towards lime green in colour rather than pure yellow, while in India, it has orange to red markings and small black bars on the dorsum, almost as rich in colouration as the paradise tree snake. Due to their size, their gliding ability is considered weak.\n\nParadise tree snake, \"Chrysopelea paradisi\" : This flying snake species reaches up to three feet in length and is popular in the European pet trade. Their bodies are black, but covered in rich green scales. Clusters of red, orange, and yellow-coloured scales in the shape of flower petals line the dorsal area from the base of the neck to the tail. This is the most well known colouration, but some specimens may exhibit fully green colouration without any bright dorsal markings. Their gliding ability is considered one of the best among the flying snakes.\n\nTwin-barred tree snake or banded flying snake, \"Chrysopelea pelias\" : This is the smallest flying snake species, reaching up to two feet in length. Its base colour is black or dark grey, and the entire body is covered with thick red and thin yellow with black bands. They also have cream-coloured ventrolateral lines, while the ventrals are pale green. While it is tiny, it is undoubtedly one of the rarest flying snake species within its range. Although it is able to move horizontally through the air when gliding, it does not glide as well as \"C. paradisi\".\n\nLesser-studied species are:\n\n"}

Toronto Fire Services is currently the largest municipal fire department in Canada.\n\nFire services in Toronto began in 1874 in the former City of Toronto, and still consisted of volunteer fire companies. Prior to 1874, fire services were composed of poorly trained volunteer companies in the city. The first company was created in 1826 and hook and ladder in 1831. Most were able bodied men who were trained to operate pumps to draw water from the lake. A wooden pumper truck presented to Toronto by British America Assurance Company c.1837 is now found at Black Creek Pioneer Village.\n\nThe city's poor fire fighting services were highlighted by the Great Toronto Fire in 1849 and again in the Great Fire of Toronto in 1904. After the latter fire, which destroyed much of Bay Street from The Esplanade West to Melinda Street, the Fire Department in Toronto became a critical city service and has evolved into the full-time service that exists today.\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services was created in 1998 from the merger of the former fire departments of the original City of Toronto, East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough and York. It is the largest fire department in Canada and the 5th largest municipal fire department in North America.\n\nAs part of the City's 2013 Budget plans, the City of Toronto demanded a 10% cut by all city departments. TFS, under then Fire Chief James Sales, recommended vehicle reductions at several stations (Stations 213, 215, 324 and 413) and one station to close (Station 424) to meet the 10% reduction target. As well the cuts will lead to fewer firefighters on staff.\n\nIn 2014, four pumpers (P213, P215, P413, P424) were taken out of service and Station 424 was shut down.\n\nIn 2017, under Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, the TFS Transformation Plan was developed and introduced, which included a comprehensive Inclusion Plan. An update on the status of the numerous initiatives that are included in this plan was provided as part of the 2018 budget process.\n\nIn 2018, 10 additional staff were added to support the creation of a permanent Toronto Community Housing Fire Safety Task Force. Also in 2018, one additional crew of 21 Operations Firefighters was approved to support the opening of the new Downsview fire station.\n\n\nThe Fire Chief (C1), under whom five deputy chiefs serve (C2, C3, C4, C5, C50), are all based at 4330 Dufferin Street - the central headquarters for both Toronto Fire and Toronto Paramedic Services. The four division commanders (C6, C7, C8, C9) are each based in their respective commands - north, east, south and west.\n\nAlan F. Speed became the first Fire Chief of the amalgamated Toronto Fire Services in November 1997. He served in that post until his retirement in April 2003.\n\nFollowing Speed's retirement, William (Bill) Stewart was appointed Fire Chief on May 1 st, 2003 and served until his retirement on April 30, 2012.\n\nJim Sales worked as a political bureaucrat in Town of Markham and as General Manager with the City of Barrie prior to his appointment as Toronto Fire Chief in 2012. Sales was Fire Chief in Markham from 2000 to 2001 and in Edmonton from 1988 to 2000.\n\nMatthew Pegg was appointed as interim Fire Chief in May 2016, following Sales' departure. Pegg became permanent Chief in April 2017. Pegg served as Deputy Fire Chief of Administration prior to being appointed Fire Chief.\n\nWith the exception of Sales, Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Fire Department Chiefs have been promoted within the department's ranks. Peter Ferguson was Deputy Chief of the North York Fire Department before becoming Fire Chief of the Toronto Fire Department\n\n\nToronto Fire Department began using motorized vehicles after 1911. The first motorized pumper was placed in the College St station on October 18, 1911. Before that, the TFD and previous fire companies used horse drawn engines and ladders. Prior to the 1970s, the TFD had open air vehicles (driver cab not covered and mostly aerial trucks), but since then both the TFD and TFS use full covered vehicles. Prior to the 1950s, TFD used tiller-ladder trucks and since have reverted to smaller aerial units that can operate in narrow streets in Toronto.\n\nThe TFS inherited all the vehicles of the fire departments prior to amalgamation. The current strength of TFS consists of 179 vehicles. Since amalgamation, apparatus numbers are numbered by a letter and 3 digits. The first digit stands for the command that the apparatus is in (1-North, 2-East, 3-South, 4-West). The second digit stands for the district within the command that the apparatus is in. The last digit stands for the station within the district within the command that the apparatus is assigned to.\n\nA list of types of vehicles used by the TFS: (prefix letter in brackets with \"xxx\" as placeholders) is listed below:\n\n\nThe Toronto Fire Department and successor Toronto Fire Services has operated fire boats since 1923. Fireboat \"Charles A. Reed\" was the first fireboat operated by the service, and was a wood hull boat that entered service in 1923 and remained in use until 1964.\n\nThe service presently has two fireboats in service. Fireboat \"William Lyon Mackenzie\" entered service in 1964, replacing Charles A. Reed. Fireboat \"William Lyon Mackenzie\" serves as the department's main fireboat and icebreaker. In 2006, the Toronto Fire Services acquired Fireboat \"Sora\", a light utility boat built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard. The Sora was retired from TFS on October 31, 2015, replaced by Fireboat \"William Thornton\". Fireboat \"William Thornton is a type 400 cutter built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard, and was acquired by the Toronto Fire Service in 2015.\n\nWhile not part of the fleet, Box 12 (Box 12 Association) and Support 7 (Greater Toronto Multiple Alarm Association) are canteen trucks run by volunteers and are present at large emergencies to provide food and beverages for Toronto firefighters.\n\nFormed in 1949, the Box 12 Association is Toronto’s oldest fire canteen unit, and serves firefighters in the west end and the downtown core. The unit is named after alarm box #12, which was pulled to trigger the response to the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. This canteen has served in a number of high profile multiple alarm fires in recent history, including the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto six alarm fire in 2017. The Box 12 Association celebrated 70 years of continuous volunteer service in 2018, with Mayor John Tory in attendance. Each year, an award named after this canteen is presented by the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters Association to a fire service member for voluntarism.\n\nFormed in 1975, the GTMAA vehicle is painted with TFD scheme, but not the logo (using the GTMAA patch instead). \n\nIn addition, there are various Hazardous Materials Support trucks and a Trench Rescue Support truck that respond to specialized calls. These trucks are unmanned, and are only used by trained personnel when a specialized call is dispatched. TFS also has a fleet of various mechanical support trucks. Smaller compact cars bearing the TFS colours and logo are driven by fire prevention officers and other commanding officers.\n\nToronto Fire will also acquire use of the Long Range Acoustic Device. It was one of three purchased by the Toronto Police Service for use during the G20 summit in 2010 (1 for Marine Unit, 2 for Public Safety Unit).\n\nToronto Fire Services operates and manages both the Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) team and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) response team on behalf of the City of Toronto and under contract with the Province of Ontario for Provincial deployment as required as CAN-TF3.\n\nPrior to amalgamation, the Scarborough Fire Department had their fleet painted yellow. In the years following amalgamation the markings on the fire trucks were a patchwork of the various schemes used by the former boroughs. All had \"Toronto\" decaled or painted where the former borough's name used to be and the new Toronto Fire crest was added with the new numbering scheme. Over the past 19 years - post amalgamation - the majority of the older vehicles have either been retired or repainted to match the new scheme: fire engine red with yellow reflective trim and markings.\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services (TFS) currently operates out of 83 Fire Stations (including one open seasonally) throughout the city, organized into 15 Districts. A 16th District (District 12) was disbanded in 2015. Its 4 stations were absorbed into the surrounding districts. Each District is part of one of four geographical divisions of Command. There are 4 Command areas: North, East, South and West. Each geographical division is divided into four Districts. Several Companies have been disbanded or reassigned. There are Platoon Chiefs and District Chiefs that are assigned Car(Chief)Units.\n\nThe North Command's Office (Command 1) is located at Fire Station # 114, 12 Canterbury Place. \n\nThe East Command's Office (Command 2) is located at Station 221. Pumpers 213 and 215 have been disbanded and Pumper 224 is now Pumper 221 \n\nThe South Command's Office (Command 3) is located at Fire Station # 332, 260 Adelaide St. W. Aerial 311 has been disbanded.\n\nThe West Command's Office (Command 4) is located at Fire Station # 442, 2015 Lawrence Ave. W.

After retiring as a player, she coached Martina Navratilova to two Wimbledon titles.\n\nRichards was born on August 19, 1934, in New York City, named \"Richard Raskind\", and raised, as she put it, as \"a nice Jewish boy\" in Forest Hills, Queens. Her father David Raskind was an orthopedic surgeon, and her mother was one of the first female psychiatrists in the United States, in addition to being a professor at Columbia University.\n\nRichards attended Horace Mann School and excelled as the wide receiver for the football team, the pitcher for the baseball team, and on the tennis and swim teams. Her baseball skills even led to an invitation to join the New York Yankees, but she decided to focus on tennis. After high school Richards attended Yale University and was captain of the men's tennis team, and was considered by some to be one of the best college tennis players in the country. After graduating from Yale, she went to the University of Rochester Medical Center and specialized in ophthalmology, graduating in 1959 and serving a two-year internship at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. After an internship, she served two years of residency at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York. She played competitive tennis for a while and was ranked sixth out of the top 20 males over 35. After an internship and residency, she joined the United States Navy to continue medical training and played tennis in the Navy. While serving in the Navy, she won both the singles and doubles at the All Navy Championship, with a very effective left-hand serve. During this time she was ranked as high as fourth in the region.\n\nDuring college Richards began dressing as a woman, which at the time was considered to be a perversion, with transsexualism classified as a form of insanity. Richards named her female persona \"Renée\", which is French for \"reborn\". Her struggle with gender identity created sexual confusion, depression, and suicidal tendencies. She began seeing Dr. Charles Ihlenfeld, a disciple of Harry Benjamin who specialized in endocrinology, transsexualism, and sexual reassignment. Upon seeing Ihlenfeld she began getting hormone injections with the long-term hope for a life change. In the mid-1960s she traveled in Europe dressed as a woman, intending to go to North Africa to see Georges Burou, a famous gynecological surgeon at Clinique Parc in Casablanca, Morocco, regarding sex reassignment surgery; however, she ultimately decided against it and returned to New York. Richards married model Barbara Mole in June 1970, and together they had a son Nicholas in 1972. They were divorced in 1975. \n\nIn the early 1970s, Richards resolved to undergo sex reassignment and was referred to surgeon Roberto C. Granato Sr. by Harry Benjamin, successfully transitioning in 1975. After surgery, Richards went to Newport Beach, California and started working as an ophthalmologist in practice with another doctor.\n\nFollowing Richards' disclosure of her gender reassignment, the United States Tennis Association (USTA), the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and the United States Open Committee (USOC) required all female competitors to verify their sex with a Barr body test of their chromosomes. Richards applied to play in the US Open in 1976 as a woman, but refused to take the test, and thus was not allowed to compete in the Open, Wimbledon, or the Italian Open in the summer of 1976.\n\nRichards then sued the United States Tennis Association (USTA), which runs the US Open, in New York state court, alleging discrimination by gender in violation of the New York Human Rights Law. She asserted that participating in the tournament would constitute \"an acceptance of her right to be a woman.\" Some USTA members felt that others would undergo sex change to enter women's tennis. \"Sports Illustrated\" called Richards an \"extraordinary spectacle\", and characterized reactions to her as \"varying from astonishment to suspicion, sympathy, resentment, and more often than not, utter confusion.\" The USOC stated \"there is competitive advantage for a male who has undergone a sex change surgery as a result of physical training and development as a male.\" Richards finally agreed to take the Barr body test. The test results were ambiguous. She refused to take it again and was barred from play.\n\nOn August 16, 1977, Judge Alfred M. Ascione found in Richards' favor. He ruled: \"This person is now a female\" and that requiring Richards to pass the Barr body test was \"grossly unfair, discriminatory and inequitable, and a violation of her rights.\" He further ruled that the USTA intentionally discriminated against Richards, and granted Richards an injunction against the USTA and the USOC, allowing her to play in the US Open. Richards lost to Virginia Wade in the first round of the singles competition, but made it to the finals in doubles.\n\nAfter moving to California, Richards played in regional competitions for her local club, the John Wayne Tennis Club, under the name Renée Clark. In the summer of 1976 she entered the La Jolla Tennis Tournament Championships, where she crushed the competition, and her unique left hand serve was recognized by Bob Perry, a tour player from UCLA. Her long-time friend Gene Scott then invited her to play in his professional tennis tournament, the Tennis Week Open in South Orange, New Jersey. The USTA and the WTA then withdrew their sanction for the Tennis Week Open, and organized another tournament; 25 of the 32 participants withdrew from the Tennis Week Open. This was just the beginning of the issues Richards would encounter in trying to play professional women's tennis, which eventually led to her suing the USTA and winning. \n\nRichards played professionally from 1977 to 1981 when she retired at age 47. She was ranked as high as 20th overall (in February 1979), and her highest ranking at the end of a year was 22nd (in 1977). Her first professional event as a female was the 1977 U.S. Open. Her greatest successes on court were reaching the doubles final at her first U.S. Open in 1977, with Betty Ann Grubb Stuart – the pair lost a close match to Martina Navratilova and Betty Stöve – and winning the 35-and-over women's singles. Richards was twice a semifinalist in mixed doubles, with Ilie Năstase, at the U.S. Open. In 1979, she defeated Nancy Richey for the 35-and-over singles title at the Open. Richards posted wins over Hana Mandlíková, Sylvia Hanika, Virginia Ruzici, and Pam Shriver. She later coached Navratilova to two Wimbledon wins.\n\nRichards was inducted into the USTA Eastern Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000. On August 2, 2013, Richards was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nRichards has since expressed ambivalence about her legacy, and came to believe her past as a man provided her with advantages over her competitors, saying \"Having lived for the past 30 years, I know if I'd had surgery at the age of 22, and then at 24 went on the tour, no genetic woman in the world would have been able to come close to me. And so I've reconsidered my opinion.\"\n\nAfter four years of playing tennis, she decided to return to her medical practice, which she moved to Park Avenue in New York. She then became the surgeon director of ophthalmology and head of the eye-muscle clinic at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. In addition she served on the editorial board of the \"Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus\". She now lives in a small town north of New York City with her platonic companion Arleen Larzelere.\n\nIn 2014 a wooden racket used by her was donated to the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian.\n\nIn 1983, Richards published an autobiography, \"Second Serve\", and in 2007, a second, \"No Way Renée: The Second Half of My Notorious Life\", in which she expresses regret over the type of fame that came with her transgenderism – she said in 2007 that she did not regret undergoing the sex reassignment process in itself. Richards's first autobiography served as the basis for the film \"Second Serve\". \"Renée\" is a 2011 documentary film about Richards. The film was one of the anchor films of the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival and the documentary premiered on ESPN on October 4, 2011.\n\nA = did not participate in the tournament.\n\nSR = the ratio of the number of singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.\n\nNote: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\nA = did not participate in the tournament.\n\nSR = the ratio of the number of singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.\n\nNote: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2210441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210441", "title": "Black toad", "text": "Black toad\n\nThe black toad (\"Anaxyrus exsul\"), also known as the Inyo toad or Deep Springs toad, is a true toad that lives only in scattered oases in the Deep Springs Valley of Inyo County, California. In fact, its original scientific name, \"Bufo exsul\", means \"exiled toad,\" which refers to its species' isolation in a tiny spot in the high desert wilderness of the Californian Great Basin.\n\nThe toad's black skin is covered in white and tan speckles and it sports a white midline down its spine from head to rump. Adults are approximately in length. They are active during the warmer months and overwinter underground near their native springs. This species walks rather than hops, and never strays far from water. Male black toads do not have vocal sacs and do not make a real advertisement call, but rather a small chirping noise as a territorial call around other males; much like its close relative the western toad.\n\nThe habitat of the black toad is relatively intact, however it is still considered a vulnerable species because although it is abundant within its habitat, the black toad has a very limited range. Deep Springs College continues a program to care for the wild population of this species, and owns much of the land where its habitat is found. Livestock grazing has occurred in much of the toad habitat for more than one hundred years, and grazing, vegetation management, and irrigation have been suggested as possibly increasing the suitable habitat for the species, which breeds in otherwise comparatively rare open water. As noted in the IUCN Red List, the population of this species was reported to be more or less stable in the early 1970s, and no significant change was reported in 1990 or 1999. The population at Antelope Springs was once reported to have died out, but was found by researchers in 2003, and is now apparently thriving where vegetation has been maintained in a suitable state. In 1977 it was estimated that there were more than 80,000 individuals in the population.\n\nThe toad's primary habitat is watercourses, irrigation ditches, and marshes (grass, sedge, dwarf bulrush, and watercress) formed by waterflow from springs, surrounded by cold desert steppe. Adults are more aquatic than other toad species in California, and breed in shallow marsh and pond waters. The toads retreat to rodent burrows or other refuges in winter. At present, there do not appear to be any major threats to this species. However, potential future threats might include habitat destruction from changes in irrigation schemes or other factors resulting in water table alteration, well-intentioned but non-scientifically based conservation efforts, changes in water availability, recreational vehicle use, collection by humans, changes in grazing regimes and predation by introduced fish. Other desert toads in nearby areas have done well, and even thrived, with more active management. Black toad adults prefer habitats with short plant cover and unobstructed access to still or slowly flowing water. In recent years, fencing some springs to exclude cattle has resulted in an overgrowth of vegetation requiring hand cutting to keep the habitat accessible for toads. The toads have been able to maintain a fairly stable population regardless of changes in agriculture and grazing practices over the past 20 years.\n\n\n"}

Ramaswamy Choudary\n\nTripuraneni Ramaswamy (1887–1943), also known as Tripuraneni Ramaswamy, was a lawyer, poet, playwright and reformer active among the Telugu-speaking people. Popularly known as Kaviraju (the \"king of poets\"), Ramaswamy is considered the first poet to introduce rationalism and humanism into Telugu poetry and literature.\n\nRamaswamy was part of a growing movement in India to reassess the culture of India. This movement included such people as Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Ranade, Dayananda Saraswati, Kandukuri Veeresalingam and Gurazada Apparao.\n\nRamaswamy was born in the village of Angaluru in the Krishna District (present day Andhra Pradesh) into a family of farmers. At the age of 23, he passed his Matriculation Examination. In the same year Ramaswamy wrote two plays: \"Karempudi Kadanam,\" based on the Palanadu battle, and \"Kurukshetra Sangramam,\" based on the Mahabharata war. In 1911, Ramaswamy joined the Noble College at Bandar to study for the Intermediate Course. In those years he displayed his literary skills and prodigious memory in his Avadhanam.\n\nIn 1914, Ramaswamy went to Britain and studied law as well as English Literature and modern European culture in Dublin. During this time, Ramaswamy wrote to Krishna Patrika, a Telugu weekly appealing to Indians to support the Home Rule movement started by Annie Besant. He pleaded for India's independence. Ramaswamy wrote many patriotic songs during the independence movement.\n\nAfter returning to India, Ramaswamy practiced law for some years, mostly in Tenali town. However, his main activity was directed towards social reforms. He launched a full-scale attack on casteism and the social injustices resulting from it.\n\nRamaswamy chose literary writing as the vehicle for expressing his rationalist thoughts. His work \"Sutaparanam\" in four cantos was a fierce attack on the ancient Puranas, Ramaswamy has attained the state of excellence in poetic&literary criticism. His poetic work \"Kuppuswamy Satakam\" reveals the theme of social revolution and talks about social evils, blind faith and indignity to man. He was against Congress and its fight against independence.\n\nIn his other works such as \"Sambhukavadha\", \"Suthashrama geethaalu\", \"Dhoortha maanava\", \"Khooni\", \"Bhagavadgita\", \"Rana Pratap\" and \"Kondaveeti pathanam\", Ramaswamy made a rational analysis of dogmas prescribed by ancient classics and the injustice these dogmas did to people belonging to the lower social orders. Moreover, Ramaswamy attacked discriminatory practices and fought against the idea of untouchability.\n\nSambhuka Vadha created lot of controversy. Sambhuka was a character who did tapas to go heaven with live body before death. That was considered as \"adharma\" and was killed by Lord Rama. This story was interpreted that Brahmins do not like doing tapas by non-Brahmins, which is why Sabhuka was killed.\n\nRamaswamy was against the traditional Hindu marriage ceremony which resulted in burdensome expenditure, especially among the poor. He prepared a simple procedure in Telugu called Vivaha Vidhi. He officiated at many marriages. When he was the Chairman of Tenali Municipality, he did not permit animal sacrifice to appease Devatas.\n\nRamaswamy was a patriot even when he was a student. He wrote a patriotic play \"Rana Pratap\", which was proscribed by the British government. He was an ardent lover of the Telugu language and culture and was proud of their history. He was an educationist and was a member of the senate of the Andhra University for three terms. Ramaswamy was awarded many honors and was popularly known as 'Kaviraju', a title conferred on him.\n\nRamaswamy died in 1943, but left his imprint on the development of the Telugu-speaking people. The Indian government honored his legacy by issuing a commemorative postage stamp with his picture in 1987, his centenary year.\n\nAmong his children were Tripuraneni Gopichand, who has left his own mark on the Telugu literature, Tripuraneni Gokul Chand whose literary work Karuvu Rojulu was associated with ex-Chief Minister Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao during his initial days, and Chouda Rani, who married Pitcheswara Rao Atluri and was the first woman to run an exclusively Telugu language bookstore in Tamil Nadu.\n\n"}

The cathedral is the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope. It was built during the time when Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and was inaugurated by him in 1969.\n\nThe church is dedicated to St Mark the Evangelist, an apostle of Jesus and founder of the Coptic Church. Relics of his life are kept inside. It was until 2019 (after the inauguration of the new Nativity Cathedral) by far the largest cathedral in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nHistorically the land where the Cathedral stands has been used for centuries as a cemetery for the Copts; this land had the historic Anba Rouis' Church. Rumors persist that the land had been of the Tomb of Alexander the Great, as that landmark disappeared from record at the same time that this church was erected.\n\nThe land had been given to the Coptic Orthodox Church in 969 by Gawhar. This land was given as a replacement for the land that was taken from the church to be included in building the Palace of Ma'ad al-Muizz Li-Deenillah as part of the planning of the new capital of Egypt, Cairo.\n\nDuring the twelfth century the area contained ten Coptic churches, but during the rule of Qalawun on 18 February 1280 the churches were destroyed by Muslims who persecuted the Copts. Two churches were subsequently built in the area under the rule of his son.\n\nIn 1943 the governorate of Cairo attempted to expropriate the area for public use. This was opposed by the General Congregation Council led by its secretary at the time Habib Elmasry. The campaign proved successful as the Coptic Church maintained control of the land under the condition that a non-profit building be built on it in the following fifteen years. This condition spurred the building of the cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral is where Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria has his office, thus security is normally high here. However, on 11 December 2016, during the Muslim festival of Mawlid, the chapel near the cathedral was the venue of an Islamic terrorist attack that killed at least 25 people, most of them women and children. This attack is a copy cat of various other earlier attacks against Coptic churches in Egypt.\n\nThe cathedral is considered a unique example of architectural evolution which includes seven churches of which some have a great historic value such as Anba Rouis' Church. The Cathedral represents the rapid development of Coptic architecture, the famous Coptic civil engineer Michel Bakhoum contributed in its structural design. It has a capacity for 5,000 worshipers.\n\nBefore the completion of the Cathedral, the Roman Catholic pontiff of the time, Pope Paul VI, returned part of St. Mark's relics, which were stolen from Egypt in the year 828 to Venice, Italy. These relics were taken to the newly constructed Cathedral, where they were placed in a specially-built shrine brightly decorated with Coptic icons, where they have remained until the present time.\n\nThe inauguration of the new Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral took place on 25 June 1968 in a ceremony attended by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, among other foreign clergy members from other churches. It is the seat of Tawadros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and the See of St. Mark.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210465", "title": "Peace River Regional District", "text": "Peace River Regional District\n\nThe Peace River Regional District is a regional district in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The regional district comprises seven municipalities and four electoral areas. Its member municipalities are the cities of Fort St. John and Dawson Creek, the district municipalities of Tumbler Ridge, Chetwynd, Taylor, and Hudson's Hope, and the village of Pouce Coupe. The district's administrative offices are in Dawson Creek.\n\nThe regional district also has four regional district electoral areas: B, C, D and E. Six Indian reserves and one Indian settlement are located within the regional district's boundaries, but are not governed by the regional district.\n\nIts modern boundaries were established on October 31, 1987, when the Peace River-Liard Regional District was divided in two. The separated northern territories became the Fort Nelson-Liard Regional District, now the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality.\n\nEast of the Rockies, the regional district is characterized by rolling hills with grain and cattle farms. About 40% of the province's Agricultural Land Reserve is situated within the regional district. The Peace River flows west-to-east through the middle of the eastern half of the regional district. West of the Rockies the terrain is severe mountain wilderness with few roads and only a handful of inhabitants. Its total land area is 119,200.1 km (46,023.42 sq mi), the largest regional district in British Columbia in area. (The Stikine Region is larger, but is not a regional district.) The total population reported in the 2006 census was 58,264 with 24,019 private dwellings, up from 55,080 people in 2001.\n\nWestward expansion during the 18th and 19th centuries pushed First Nation groups westward and into competition with each other for resources. The Algonkian-speaking Cree had pushed the Athapaskan-speaking Dunneza into the BC portion of the Peace River Country, which pushed the fellow Athapaskan-speaking Sekani into the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and beyond. European-Canadian explorers penetrated the area during the 19th century by canoeing allow the Peace River and establishing trading posts at Fort St. John and Hudson's Hope. In 1883 the province gave the federal government control over of land, anywhere north the Rocky Mountains, as part of a deal to extend a rail line to Vancouver. After settling land claims with Treaty 8 First Nations, creating the East Moberly Reserve, West Moberly Reserve, Halfway River Reserve, and the St. John Reserve, the government surveyed out its land as the Peace River Block in 1907 and opened it to homesteading in 1912. Pioneer Hector Tremblay, and a few others, helped cut trails and opened stores and lodges to help incoming settlers. The first community of these settlers was established at Pouce Coupe, around Tremblay's cabin. The land was granted back to the province in 1930 after conflicts regarding the water and mineral rights emerged.\n\nThe region grew slowly as agricultural settlements spread westward to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and northward to the muskegs of the Liard. In 1932 Pouce Coupe became the first community in the region to incorporate as a village, followed by Dawson Creek in 1936 after a rail line was extended there from Alberta. The 1941 Canadian Census recorded 8,444 people in northeastern BC but a year later the Alaska Highway was constructed by 10,000 US Army servicemen connecting Dawson Creek to Alaska via Fort Nelson. After the war and turning the highway over the province, the highway made it much easier to transport resources and agricultural products to rail lines and left Dawson Creek with 14-fold increase, and northeastern BC with a 2.5-fold increase, in population by 1956. Industrial development began with the provincially funded megaprojects which included the extension of transportation and utility infrastructure through the Rocky Mountains to Chetwynd and across the region and the construction of two hydroelectric dams at Hudson's Hope. An oil and gas industry developed and helped Fort St. John's population increase from 3,619 people in 1961 to 13,891 in 1981 surpassing Dawson Creek as the largest city. The last municipality in the region to incorporate was Tumbler Ridge which was built by the province in 1981 as an instant community to service two proposed coal mines. The region experienced little growth in the late-1980s and the population remained between 55,000 and 59,000 between 1992 and 2003. Since then, with a booming oil and gas industry, the population has gained over 5,500 people in three years.\n\nThe Regional District is the largest in the province, comprising 13% of its area. At 119,200 km (46,023 mi) it is similar in area to the American state of Pennsylvania or New Zealand's North Island. The northern border along the 58th parallel north was created when the PRLRD split to create the PRRD and the NRRD. The Regional District borders with six municipal districts in Alberta to the east – the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16, the County of Grande Prairie No. 1, Saddle Hills County, Clear Hills County and the County of Northern Lights. The southwestern border runs along the Rocky Mountains, beginning at Intersection Mountain then northwesterly along the summit of the Hart Ranges to Williston Lake and then northwesterly along the watersheds of the Manson, Omineca, Mesilinka, Finlay, and Kechika rivers.\n\nDespite this large area, only about 64,272 people live there, giving the Regional District a population density of 0.54 people per km (1.4 people/mi). The people live almost exclusively in the agricultural areas in British Columbia's portion of the Peace River Country straddling the Peace River. This biogeoclimatic zone, called the Boreal White and Black Spruce Zone, begins on the northern end of the Rockies and stretches into Alberta and the NRRD. Here, mean annual temperatures have ranged between -2.9 and 2 °C with annual precipitation averages between 330 and 570 mm.\n\nAccording to BC's Ecoregion Classification System most of the Regional District is located in the Boreal Plains Ecoprovince of the Polar Ecodomain. This area is characterized by a continental climate with low year-round precipitation. Moist Pacific air loses its precipitation over several mountain ranges before moving over the region, while Arctic air masses are uninterrupted. About 61% of BC's bird species and 46% of all breeding species occur in this ecoprovince. This ecoprovince is divided into four ecosections: the rolling uplands with few ridges and wide valleys of the Clear Hills and Halfway Plateau ecosections, the wide plains with deeply incised rivers of the Peace Lowland ecosection, and the rolling uplands and Rocky Mountain foothills of the Kiskatinaw Plateau ecosection. These ecosections have many wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams the area is a major migratory corridor for water- and shorebirds. Moose are the most common large mammal but mule and white-tailed deer, caribou, and elk are also very common. The ecosystem also supports Dall sheep, black bear, grizzly bear, and gray wolf. There are few small mammal or reptile species. Fish species are restricted to freshwater fish like the Arctic grayling, northern pike, and slimy sculpin. Major tree species include white spruce, black spruce, trembling aspen, lodgepole pine, balsam poplar, tamarack, subalpine fir, and paper birch.\n\nThe Regional District is governed by a board of 11 directors. The Board consists of one representative from each municipality, usually the mayors, and one director from each electoral area. The municipal representatives, and their alternates, are elected by the municipal councils and the electoral area directors are elected for 3 year terms by their constituents during province-wide local elections. Due to its population size relative to the other jurisdictions and the Board's weighted voting scheme, Fort St. John elects two directors and two alternates. The Board annually elects a chairperson from its membership. The Board convenes twice a month in the board room of Regional District office in Dawson Creek, although they occasionally meet in other member municipalities. Portions of these meetings are dedicated to the matters arising from the Peace River Hospital District which has the same membership and is responsible for raising capital for hospital expenditures.\n\nThe Electoral Area Directors Committee, consisting of the four electoral area directors, meet separately from the Board as a committee twice a month and addresses issues from their jurisdictions that do not require municipal participation. The board directors also form committees for wildlife, solid waste, rural budgets, and parks and recreation. The directors are joined with members of the public on committees for agricultural advisory, libraries, fire protection, community sewer systems, and emergency management. Directors can also be appointed to outside agencies to represent the interests of the Regional District.\n\nThe Regional District is covers portions of two provincial electoral areas: Peace River South and Peace River North. Peace River South is entirely with the Regional District and is represented by Mike Bernier in the Legislative Assembly. Peace River North, represented by Pat Pimm, includes the northern half of the Regional District as well as the entire Northern Rockies Regional District. The Peace River Regional District is entirely with the federal riding of Prince George—Peace River and is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Bob Zimmer.\n\nThe Peace River Regional District administers five regional parks:\n\nIn cooperation with member municipalities and communities, the PRRD supports and/or finances recreation facilities in many communities. These include:\n\nThe regional district supports community organizations in maintaining various public community halls and grounds.\n\nThe regional district and the municipalities within it observe Mountain Standard Time (UTC−7) year round; they do not change their clocks for daylight saving time. Hence, from March to November, clocks in the regional district are synchronized with the rest of the province, which is on Pacific Daylight Time. During the winter, they are synchronized with clocks in Alberta.\n\nThe surrounding regions, namely Grande Prairie, Alberta (Mountain Time) and Prince George, British Columbia (Pacific Time) do observe daylight-saving time.\n\n\n"}

The district spans from Columbia to the South Carolina side of the Augusta, Georgia metropolitan area.\n\nFrom 1993 through 2012, it included all of Lexington, Jasper, Hampton, Allendale and Barnwell counties; most of Richland and Beaufort counties and parts of Aiken, Calhoun and Orangeburg counties.\n\nIt was made more compact in the 2010 round of redistricting, and now comprises all of Lexington, Aiken and Barnwell counties, most of Richland County, and part of Orangeburg County. Besides Columbia (60 percent of which is in the district), other major cities in the district include Aiken and North Augusta.\n\nThe district's current configuration dates from 1933, following South Carolina losing a seat in apportionment as a result of the 1930 Census showing that the state's population had declined. Before that time, much of its territory had been within the 6th district.\n\nAs a Columbia-based district from 1933 to the early 1990s, it was a fairly compact district in the central part of the state, which was largely coextensive with the Columbia metropolitan area. As a result of the 1990 census, the state legislature was required to draw a black-majority district. In a deal between Republicans and Democrats, the 6th District, previously located in the northeastern portion of the state, was redefined to incorporate most of the old 2nd's black residents. To make up for the loss in population, the 2nd was pushed as far west as the fringes of the Augusta suburbs and as far south as Beaufort/Hilton Head.\n\nSince 1965 the 2nd district has been held by the Republican Party, made up of white conservatives in the late 20th-century realignment of political parties in the South. In the decades after the Civil War and before disenfranchisement in 1895 under the new state constitution, members of the Republican Party in South Carolina and the South were mostly African Americans, including many freedmen enfranchised due to Republican support for amendments for emancipation, citizenship and the franchise. After white Democrats regained control of state governments across the South, in the late 19th century, they passed new constitutions from 1890 to 1908 to disenfranchise blacks, excluding them totally from the political process. The Republican Party was crippled in the region and nearly comatose.\n\nAs a result of the Civil Rights Movement, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for federal enforcement of blacks' constitutional rights. That year, the 2nd district's second-term Democratic congressman, Albert Watson, resigned, then ran as a Republican in the ensuing special election and won, becoming the first Republican to represent South Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.\n\nWatson gave up the seat to run for governor in 1970. His successor, state senator Floyd Spence, held the seat for more than 30 years. He was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee from 1995 to 2001, and died a few months after being elected to a 16th term. He was succeeded in a special election by one of his former aides, state senator Joe Wilson.\n\nWilson has since been reelected seven times. In the most recent election, held on November 4, 2014, Wilson earned almost 62.5% of the vote against former Democrat Phil Black and Labor Party candidate Harold Geddings. The district is more than 69% white.\n\n"}

Ultimately the wars do end, with the deaths of the last men on Earth, two soldiers shooting each other, one shoots the other soldier and the injured soldier kills the last, but slowly dies as he sinks into a watery foxhole while his hand grasps into the water. Afterwards, the surviving animals discover a copy of an implied Bible in the ruins of a church. Inspired by the book's teachings, they decide to rebuild a society dedicated to peace and non-violence (using the helmets of the soldiers to construct houses). The short features a version of \"Hark!

{"id": "2210520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210520", "title": "Echinostoma", "text": "Echinostoma\n\nEchinostoma is a genus of trematodes, which can infect both humans and other animals. These intestinal flukes have a three-host life cycle with snails or aquatic organisms as intermediate hosts, and a variety of animals, including humans, as their definitive hosts.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans, and can cause a disease known as echinostomiasis. The parasites are spread when humans or animals eat infected raw or undercooked food, such as bivalve molluscs or fish. \n\nIt has been estimated that there are between 61 and 114 species of \"Echinostoma\". \"Echinostoma\" are difficult to classify and are known as a cryptic species (different lineages are considered to be the same species, due to high morphological similarity between them). Many species of \"Echinostoma\" have been re-classified several times. For example, the species now known as \"Echinostoma caproni\", was previously known by a variety of names including \"E. liei\", \"E. parasensei\" and \"E. togoensis\".\n\nMethods for classifying \"Echinostoma\" species, such as the \"Echinostoma revolutum\" group, were devised by Kanev. The \"Echinostoma\" species in this group are now classified according to their shared morphological and biological characteristics, such as the presence of 37 collar spines.\n\nMolecular methods, such as sequencing mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal DNA, are also used to distinguish between species of \"Echinostoma\" as an alternative to morphological classification methods.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" species include:\n\n\"Echinostoma\" are internal digenean trematode parasites which infect the intestines and bile duct of their hosts.\n\nThe length and width of adult \"Echinostoma\" varies between species, but they tend to be approximately 2-10mm × 1-2mm in size.\n\nAdult \"Echinostoma\" have two suckers: an anterior oral sucker and a ventral sucker. They also have a characteristic head collar with spines surrounding their oral sucker. The number of collar spines varies between \"Echinostoma\" species, but there are usually between 27 and 51. These spines can be arranged in one or two circles around the sucker, and their arrangement may be a characteristic feature of an \"Echinostoma\" species.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" have a digestive system consisting of a pharynx, oesophagus and an excretory pore.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" are hermaphrodites, and have both male and female reproductive organs. The testes are found in the posterior part of the fluke's body, in the area furthest from the mouth. The ovary is also found in this location, close to the testes.\n\nThe eggs (ova) of \"Echinostoma\" are operculate and vary in size, but are typically in the range of 80-135μm × 55-80μm.\n\nThe genus \"Echinostoma\" has a global distribution. These parasites are particularly common in South East Asia, in countries such as South Korea and the Philippines. However, they are also found in some European countries, and species such as \"Echinostoma trivolvis\" are found in North America.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" have three hosts in their life cycle: a first intermediate host, a second intermediate host and a definitive host. Snail species such as \"Lymnaea\" spp. are common intermediate hosts for \"Echinostoma\", although fish and other bivalve molluscs can also be intermediate hosts for these parasites.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" species have low specificity for their definitive hosts, and can infect a variety of different species of animal, including amphibians, aquatic birds, mammals and humans. A definitive host which is infected with \"Echinostoma\" will shed unembryonated \"Echinostoma\" eggs in their faeces. When the eggs are in contact with fresh water they may become embryonated, and will then hatch and release miracidia. The miracidia stage of \"Echinostoma\" is free-swimming, and actively penetrates the first intermediate snail host, which then becomes infected.\nIn the first intermediate host, the miracidium undergoes asexual reproduction for several weeks, which includes sporocyst formation, a few generations of rediae and the production of cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail host into water and are also free-swimming. The cercariae penetrate a second intermediate host, or they remain in the first intermediate host, where they form metacercariae. Definitive hosts become infected by eating secondary hosts which are infected with metacercariae. Once the metacercariae have been eaten, they excyst in the intestine of the definitive host where the parasite then develops into an adult.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" are hermaphrodites. A single adult individual has both male and female reproductive organs, and is capable of self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction of adult \"Echinostoma\" in the definitive host leads to the production of unembryonated eggs. The life cycle of \"Echinostoma\" is temperature dependent, and occurs quicker at higher temperatures. \"Echinostoma\" eggs can survive for about 5 months and still have the ability to hatch and develop into the next life cycle stage.\n\nInfection of humans with members of the family Echinostomatidae, including \"Echinostoma\", can lead to a disease called echinostomiasis. \"E. revolutum\", \"E. echinatum\", \"E. malaynum\" and \"E. hortense\" are particularly common causes of \"Echinostoma\" infections in humans. Humans can become infected with \"Echinostoma\" by eating infected raw or undercooked food, particularly fish, clams and snails. Infection with these parasites tends to be common in regions where cultural dishes require the use of raw or undercooked food that may be infected with \"Echinostoma\". A mild infection may not have any symptoms. If symptoms are present they can include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tiredness and weight loss.\n\nEchinostomiasis is endemic in South East Asia and the Far East, in countries including China, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and India. Echinostomiasis has also been reported in Japan, Singapore, Romania, Hungary and Italy. The prevalence of echinostomiasis varies between countries but there tend to be foci of infection in areas where raw or undercooked hosts of \"Echinostoma\", such as snails or fish, are widely consumed.\n\n\"Echinostoma\" are not highly pathogenic. Symptoms of greater severity tend to be seen in an echinostomiasis infection where there is a higher number of flukes. The flukes cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, which leads to ulceration and inflammation.\n\nAn \"Echinostoma\" infection can be diagnosed by observing the parasite eggs in the faeces of an infected individual, under a microscope. Methods such as the Kato-Katz procedure can be used to do this. The eggs typically have a yellow-brown appearance, and are ellipsoid in shape. To confirm which species is causing the infection adult worms must be recovered from the infected individual, such as with anthelmintic treatment.\n\nEchinostomiasis can be treated with the anthelmintic drug praziquantel, as for other intestinal trematode infections. Side effects of anthelmintic drug treatment may include nausea, abdominal pain, headaches or dizziness.\n\nEchinostomiasis can be controlled at the same time as other food-borne parasite infections, using existing control programmes. Interrupting the parasite's lifecycle by efficient diagnosis and subsequent treatment of infected individuals, and preventing reinfection, may help to control this disease. As echinostomiasis is acquired through the consumption of raw or undercooked infected food, cooking food thoroughly will prevent infection.\n"}

The station is owned by Thomas R. Read, through licensee Liberty Broadcasting System, LLC.\n\nThe station broadcasts in the daytime at 25,000 watts but at night it must reduce power to 260 watts; that is because 1050 kHz is assigned as a clear channel frequency reserved for Mexico, so it cannot use a higher power that might interfere with Mexican radio stations.\n\nKFIO first signed on as KSPO in 1984. Tom and Melinda Read purchased the tower and property of the former KPEG on Crestline on Spokane's South Hill. In an interview with the Northwest Pioneer Broadcasters, Tom Read said he purchased the radio station building for his production and tape duplicating facility. Every morning he came to work and looked at the AM tower on the property and thought that the tower should be put to use. He phoned George Frese, then a consulting broadcast engineer, and asked him to conduct an AM allocation study for a new AM station for Spokane. Tom further asked George to see why 1050 would not work as it had been assigned to nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho but that station had been deleted. Frese study confirmed that 1050 AM was used by some Canadian station but was available for Spokane with 5,000 watts, daytime. The original call letters were KSPO. KSPO 1050 AM became Spokane's premier religious programmed station.\n\nYears later, KSPO 1050 was sold by Read in order to increase power of his Central Washington station, KTBI, to 50,000 watts on Clear Channel 810. The FCC rules at the time did not allow one owner to control two AM stations which overlapped. In his book, Read explained that KTBI was a grandfathered type of facility and if it did not increase power to the maximum allow at the time, it would most likely never be able to do so. So he reluctantly sold KSPO 1050.\n\nThe station went through a large number of owners through the years. Read repurchased the Crestline transmitter property and studio building after the 1050 facility was moved to another transmitter location. Finally, Mapleton was the owner of the 1050 and approached Read about purchasing the license and moving the transmitter back to its original Crestline tower where it remain today.\n\nWith the KSPO call letters used by Read on 106.5 FM in Spokane, some thought was given to using the KSPO AM and FM combination with the 1050. However, to pay honor to the original KFIO, the first licensed radio station in Spokane, Read decided to use the KFIO call letter for the new 1050 AM station. \n\nIn January 2016, KEYF owner Mapleton Communications sold the frequency to Thomas Read, owner of Spokane religious stations KSPO and KTRW, who changed the call sign to KFIO in honor of the original KFIO (now KSBN), which was assigned these call letters from 1923 to 1950. On April 25, 2016, KEYF went silent to allow for the installation of a new 25,000 watt transmitter at the Crestline location. KFIO began equipment testing in October 2016 and returned to the airwaves later that year. At 25,000 watts and on a low AM frequency, KFIO provides religious programming to a large area in Southeast Washington and Idaho.\n\nDate from the archives of the Northwest Pioneer Broadcasters and the draft of Tom Read's forthcoming book, \"A Young Man With A Microphone\".\n\n"}

For Hodgkin's it is often used together with chlormethine, vincristine, and prednisone while for brain cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme it is used with lomustine and vincristine. It is typically taken by mouth.\nCommon side effect include low blood cell counts and vomiting. Other side effects include tiredness and depression. It is not recommended in people with severe liver or kidney problems. Use in pregnancy is known to harm the baby. Procarbazine is in the alkylating agents family of medication. How it works is not clearly known.\nProcarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom a month of treatment cost the NHS 450 to 750 pounds.\n\nWhen used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is often delivered as part of the BEACOPP regimen that includes bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine (tradename Oncovin), prednisone, and procarbazine. The first combination chemotherapy developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), MOPP also included procarbazine (ABVD has supplanted MOPP as standard first line treatment for HL, with BEACOPP as an alternative for advanced/unfavorable HL). Alternatively, when used to treat certain brain tumors (malignant gliomas), it is often dosed as PCV when combined with lomustine (often called CCNU) and vincristine.\n\nDose should be adjusted for kidney disease or liver disease.\n\nVery common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Other side effects of unknown frequency include reduction in leukocytes, reduction in platelets, reduction in neutrophils, which can lead to increased infections including lung infections; severe allergy-like reactions that can lead to angioedema and skin reactions; lethargy; liver complications including jaundice and abnormal liver function tests; reproductive effects including reduction in sperm count and ovarian failure.\n\nWhen combined with ethanol, procarbazine may cause a disulfiram-like reaction in some people.\n\nIt weakly inhibits MAO in the gastrointestinal system, so it can cause hypertensive crises if associated with the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheeses; this appears to be rare.\n\nProcarbazine rarely causes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive, enduring, often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs.\n\nIts mechanism of action is not fully understood. Metabolism yields azo-procarbazine and hydrogen peroxide which results in the breaking of DNA strands.\n\n"}

He is currently the Special Assistant to the Head Coach at University of Nebraska. From 2016 to 2017, he was an assistant coach of the Windy City Bulls of the NBA Development League. He previously was an associate head coach at North Carolina State University Wolfpack men's basketball team after being an assistant coach there. Lutz was also head coach of the Charlotte 49ers basketball team from 1998 to 2010.\n\nLutz graduated from Bandys High School in Catawba, North Carolina in 1976 and from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 1980 with a B.A. in Psychology and Economics. He taught social studies and coached basketball at several high schools in North Carolina. In 1984 he received a job as a graduate assistant coach for the men's basketball team at Clemson University. Prior to the 1986–87 season he was named head coach at Pfeiffer College in Misenheimer, North Carolina. He led the Falcons to a 181–91 record in his nine years as their coach, including one berth in the NAIA championship game.\n\nIn 1995 Lutz was named the head coach at Gardner–Webb University, but resigned two weeks after accepting the job in order to become an assistant coach at his alma mater under head coach Jeff Mullins. He served as an assistant under Mullins (1995–96) and his successor, Melvin Watkins (1996–98). When Watkins accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&M University, Lutz was promoted and became the eighth head coach of the Charlotte 49ers on April 9, 1998.\n\nThe 49ers enjoyed consistent success during Lutz's tenure, reaching the NCAA Tournament five times (1999, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005), plus three appearances in the NIT (2000, 2006 and 2008). In 2005 Lutz was a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award.\n\nOn February 23, 2008, Charlotte won at home over Saint Louis 81–64, giving Lutz 183 wins at Charlotte and the all-time mark for wins by a 49ers coach, passing Mullins' 182 wins accumulated between 1985 and 1996.\n\nLutz' 49ers were expected to contend for their first NCAA Tournament berth as an Atlantic 10 member in 2009-10. With eight games to go in the season, they had a record of 18-5 and seemed well on their way to a bid. However, they went 1-7 the rest of the way. They bottomed out in the first round of the Atlantic 10 Tournament against UMass when they came out of a timeout with six men on the court. The resulting technical foul derailed a last-ditch rally, and they lost the game. After not even receiving an NIT bid, Lutz was fired on March 15, 2010. He compiled a 218–158 record at UNC Charlotte, and is the school's winningest men's basketball coach. He then spent a season as an assistant coach with the Iowa State Cyclones under head coach Fred Hoiberg.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, Lutz was appointed an assistant coach of the Windy City Bulls, a new NBA Development League franchise, under head coach Nate Loenser.\nLutz helped Coach this team to a 23-27 record. This was good for 7th in the Eastern Conference, but only the top four teams get into the playoffs. At the conclusion of the 2016-17 season, Windy City Bulls head coach Nate Loenser switched jobs with Chicago Bulls assistant coach Charlie Henry and Lutz was not a part of Henry's 2017-18 staff. \n\nLutz has a wife and two daughters.\n\n"}

He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, with his wife, with whom he has two sons. Starting with the 1994–95 NHL season, he wore uniform number 12, and, since the 1987–88 NHL season, he wore a helmet while refereeing NHL games.\n\nKoharski began his officiating career in the World Hockey Association in 1975, as a 19-year-old linesman. (He is the final player or official from the WHA to be involved in professional hockey in an on-ice capacity.) In 1976, he was signed by the American Hockey League while working with a local dairy farm, for which he was milking cows. He began his NHL career in 1977 as a linesman, before moving to the referee role in 1980.\n\nEntering the 2005–06 season, Koharski had officiated over 1,400 regular season games, 235 playoff games, thirteen Stanley Cup Finals, two All-Star Games, two Canada Cups, and the 2004 World Cup. He was the league's second-most senior official, behind only referee Kerry Fraser. On April 8, 2006, Koharski reached the 1,500-regular-season-game milestone when he officiated a game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nDuring the NHL player lockout of 2004–05, Koharski officiated a charity game between former players from the United Hockey League, as part of their All-Star Game festivities.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was announced that Koharski would retire as an NHL referee at the end of the 2008–09 NHL season; however, he will stay on with the NHL in a supervisory or instructional position.\n\nHis son Jamie and brother Terry also worked as referees in various leagues, including the USHL, ECHL and AHL. Jamie retired in 2016 after a 12-season career in the AHL and now serves as an advisor for the ECHL and USA Hockey's Officiating Development Program, while Terry remains active in the AHL.\n\nIn total, he officiated 1,719 regular season games and 248 playoff games.\n\nOn May 6, 1988, Koharski got into a shouting match with New Jersey Devils Head Coach Jim Schoenfeld, after Game Three of the Wales (now Eastern) Conference Finals (which the Devils lost to the Boston Bruins, 6-1). Walking off the ice, Koharski apparently stumbled when his skate blade gave out. The referee then accused Schoenfeld of bumping him, which the coach denied:\n\nKoharski: \"Oh, you're gone now! You're gone. You won't coach another...\" \n\nSchoenfeld: \"You fell and you know it. You know you fell. I didn't touch you.\" \n\nKoharski: \"You're gone. You're gone. And I hope it's on tape.\" \n\nSchoenfeld: \"Good, 'cause you fell, you fat pig. Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!\" \n\nThe next day, NHL Vice President Bryan O'Neill announced, just hours before Game Four was to be played at Meadowlands Arena, that Schoenfeld was suspended for at least one game pending further investigation. The Devils, however, got in touch with Bergen County Judge James F. Madden to issue an injunction to allow Schoenfeld back in the coach's box, just before the game was scheduled to start. Showing solidarity with Koharski, though, referee Dave Newell and linesmen Ray Scapinello and Gord Broseker refused to work the game, as did backup referee Denis Morel. A sellout crowd was forced to wait over an hour until replacement officials could be found. (Paul McInnis, a manager of a skating rink in Yonkers, New York, took over as referee, with Vin Godelski and Jim Sullivan as linesmen.)\n\nNew Jersey won Game Four, 3-1. After a proper hearing was held for Coach Schoenfeld, he was indeed suspended for Game Five (in which Devils' GM Lou Lamoriello made his NHL coaching debut). The Bruins would go on to win the series in seven games, then be swept by the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Finals.\n"}

{"id": "2210602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210602", "title": "Trichuris muris", "text": "Trichuris muris\n\nTrichuris muris is a nematode parasite of mice. It is very similar to the human roundworm parasite \"Trichuris trichiura\" due to its immunological reactivity when crossed, and so is often used in related studies.\n\nIngesting material that contains embryonated eggs allows for transmission and infection to occur. The eggs travel down to the cecum - a pouch located at the start of the large intestine - where larval hatching is induced. The larvae proceed to penetrate through the mucosal epithelium, then molt into their secondary stage of infection after 9–11 days. About 17 days after infection, the larvae arrive at the tertiary stage followed by a quaternary molt 5 days later. The larvae complete their last molt 29 days after infection and transform into mature dioecious adults. These whipworms use their anterior ends to embed themselves into the cells that line the walls of the large intestine. After establishing their place in the intestinal wall, the adult worms mate and release unembryonated eggs into the environment via the feces.\n\n\"T. muris\" relies on direct contact with intestinal bacteria to promote hatching of the embryonated eggs. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and \"E. coli\" strains, the bacteria are seen to gather specifically around the opercula, which are located at the poles of the eggs. The bacteria contain type 1 fimbriae, which possess adhesin FimH at their fimbrial tips. FimH interacts with a mannosylated receptor found on the egg's surface. When bound, a signal transduction cascade is triggered and results in the worm emerging from the egg. Temperature, in particular at 37°C, serves as an additional hatching cue; this specific temperature is thought to prevent \"T. muris\" eggs from hatching in unideal outside environments.\n\nThe relationship between \"T. muris\" and bacteria also has a significant effect on the host's immune response. The activation of type 2 helper cells (Th2) is decreased in the presence of antibiotics because fewer whipworms bind to the intestinal walls. This, in turn, drives up the proliferation and differentiation of Th17 and Th1 cells. About 18 days after infection, the worm burden in antibiotically treated mice was drastically reduced, further supporting the notion that bacteria are essential to the worms' establishment.\n\n"}

Founded as Boiling Springs High School in 1905, Gardner-Webb is one of only three private, Carnegie-classified Doctoral/Professional Universities (along with Duke University and Wake Forest University) in North Carolina.\n\nApproximately 4,000 students attend Gardner–Webb, including undergraduates, graduates and online students. A total of 6 professional schools and 14 academic departments offer more than 80 undergraduate and graduate major fields of study. GWU's Runnin' Bulldogs compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the Big South Conference.\n\nOn December 2, 1905, the Boiling Springs High School was chartered as a result of an initiative sponsored by the Kings Mountain Baptist Association (Cleveland County) and the Sandy Run Baptist Association (Rutherford County). The institution served as a place \"where the young...could have the best possible educational advantages under distinctive Christian influence.\" In May 1905 Boiling Springs Baptist Church voted to offer its old church house, five acres of land, and $2,700 to the institution, and on July 10, 1905 Boiling Springs was officially chosen for the site of the school. The location of the High School was essential, as it was located near the border of the school's sponsors, Kings Mountain and Sandy Run, and had easy access to brick building materials. The institution's name, Boiling Springs High School, was decided on October 27, 1905, and its charter was accepted less than two months later by the school's trustees. The town of Boiling Springs is named after the natural springs that can be found on campus. They provided clean water for the school when it began operation in 1907.\n\nJ.D. Huggins was made the High School's first principal on July 25, 1907. The complete faculty, which consisted of only five teachers, including Huggins, was hired by the fall of 1907. Classes started in October of the same year, although the main building, the Huggins-Curtis Building, was not complete. Students lived in various homes in the community and used classrooms from the nearby elementary school until the building's completion in 1908. The building included classrooms, auditoriums, a chapel, library, principal's office, cafeteria, living quarters, literary societies, a music room, and parlors. Although it burned down in 1957, it signified the promise and progress of the school so far.\n\nBoiling Springs High School focused on Christian education, as evident in the school's motto, \"Pro Deo et Humanitate\" (for God and Humanity). These words were inscribed upon \"the ageless granite arch\" on campus, which still exists today. Original tuition was $76.05 for a term of nine months, and although the school attracted a wide variety of students with varied interests, its focus centered around ministerial education.\n\nThe high school became Boiling Springs Junior College in 1928 due to the changing educational needs of the area. The Great Depression created many obstacles for the college, but its survival was secured by the sacrifices of loyal supporters. The college began with seven departments: English, mathematics, natural science, foreign language, social science, Bible, and education. The first graduating class consisted of roughly 200 students, with one of the earliest graduates being W. J. Cash, author of \"The Mind of the South.\"\n\nIn 1942, Governor O. Max Gardner began devoting his energy, time, and wealth to strengthening the college. On June 15, the trustees voted to change the name to Gardner–Webb Junior College in honor of Gardner and his wife, Fay Webb-Gardner. During the following year, the institution embarked on a $300,000 financial campaign. At the conclusion of this initiative the trustees announced the school to be debt-free.\n\nThe decades following World War II were years of physical growth and academic development. New buildings went up as enrollments increased. A major step in the institutions' development was its full accreditation as a senior college in December, 1971. In 1980 the college began a graduate program, which became the Graduate School in the 1990s. The School of Divinity was also founded during this time. The institution officially became known as Gardner–Webb University in January 1993, culminating years of preparation, and by the early 2000s the school had more than 3,200 students and 135 faculty members.\n\nE. B. Hamrick Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\nToday, Gardner–Webb offers eight distinct degree programs and a campus of over 200 acres. The campus has recently grown with the addition of the Tucker Student Center, a building made possible by a $5 million donation by Robert and Carolyn Tucker, owners of Shoe Show, Inc. in Concord, North Carolina. The College of Health Sciences facility (at the former Crawley Hospital complex) opened in 2015 and it houses the Hunt School of Nursing, the Physician Assistant Studies program and the Department of Exercise Science.\n\nGWU received a gift from the Gardner Foundation to support undergraduate research by establishing the Fay Webb Gardner Master Mentorship Program in 2017. In 2019, the university established the first-ever comprehensive and competitive scholarship focusing on students’ character, service, academics and Christian life; the inaugural Tucker Scholar recipient was Leah Carpenter, of Stanley, N.C.\n\nThe main campus in Boiling Springs is situated on 225 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains between Charlotte and Asheville. There is an additional satellite campus in Charlotte.\n\n\nThere are over 3,600 students enrolled at Gardner–Webb, including the day program, graduate studies, and the DCP(Degree Completion Program) designed for adult learners seeking to finish their degree. Out of these students, 63% are female and 37% are male, and in all come from a total of 21 foreign countries. There are six professional schools, two academic schools, and 14 academic departments that offer nearly 80 undergraduate and graduate major fields of study. Approximately 24% of students major in nursing, 23% in business, 18% in education, and 14% in psychology.\n\nDegrees offered include Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Arts in Education, Master of Divinity, Master of Business Administration, Master of Accountancy, International Master of Business Administration, Master of Arts in Counseling, Master of Science in Nursing, Education Specialist, Doctor of Ministry, and Doctor of Education. The university also offers Physician Assistant and Nurse Practitioner programs.\n\nThere are more than 160 full-time faculty members, 75% of them with a Ph.D. or equivalent. The average class size is about 25 and the faculty to student ration is 1:13, although classes may contain anywhere between 3 and 30 students.\n\nThe Global Opportunities for All Learners program offers students opportunities to continue their studies in order to obtain a baccalaureate degree. To be a part of the program, students must have completed 24 semester hours from a regionally accredited institution. Courses take place online.\n\nThe Noel Program for Students with Disabilities is designed to assist disabled students with obtaining their degrees. The program offers services for those who are blind, deaf, or learning disabled, and \"seeks to provide reasonable accommodations in order for students to receive equal access to a higher education while striving to assist students to obtain the knowledge, skills and confidence to become effective self advocates.\" Services offered include note-takers, interpreters, lab assistants, mobility training, and adaptive technology.\n\nIn the 2015 college rankings of \"U.S. News & World Report\", Gardner–Webb was ranked 34th (out of more than 130 schools) among regional universities in the South. The university also placed in the top tier of graduate schools in the country in the fields of Education and Nursing. In the Top Online Programs Rankings, Gardner–Webb's Business Programs ranked first in Student Services and Technology out of 161 colleges and universities across the nation. Also under the Top Online Programs Rankings, the university placed 15th in Faculty Credentials and Training and 27th in Student Engagement and Accreditation. In 2011, \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" placed Gardner–Webb as one of America's best colleges to work for, one of only four colleges in North Carolina and 111 nationwide to earn the recognition. On a global scale, the university's Online MBA Program was ninth for the year of 2012, according to \"Business MBA\"'s list of the \"Top 50 MBA Programs for 2012.\" For exhibiting what it calls \"institutionalized community engagement,\" the \"Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching\" awarded Gardner–Webb a Community Engagement Classification. GWU's core curriculum also ranks in the nation's top two percent for quality and breadth, according to the 2011–2012 \"What Will They Learn?\" study by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. The study rated schools on an \"A\" through \"F\" scale, where Gardner–Webb was among only 19 schools, and the only school in the Carolinas, to earn an \"A.\"\n\nThe acceptance rate at Gardner-Webb is 53%, admissions are conducted on a rolling basis. The average admissions statistics for the class of 2022 are: SAT: 1015; ACT: 22; GPA: 3.72.\n\nThe university offers several scholarships. The most prestigious is the Tucker Heart, Soul, Mind, and Strength Scholarship made possible via a $4 million endowed gift from Robert and Carolyn Tucker. This scholarship which will first be awarded in Fall of 2020 will cover the entire cost of a four-year education for one student in each class. The university also awards Ignite Excellence Scholarships each year with the top one going to one student and covering Tuition, Room, and Board. There are also four Ignite Scholarships given covering the cost of tuition. Additionally, the university awards multiple levels of merit-based scholarships.\n\nGardner–Webb students are expected to follow a strict honor code, signing a pledge upon enrollment to \"uphold honesty, integrity, and truthfulness in all realms of University life.\" These forms are kept in the Office of the Vice President and Dean of Student Development and clearly state that academic lying and cheating will not be tolerated.\n\nStudent and faculty responsibilities are clearly outlined in the code, showing that students are fully responsible for their own works and that plagiarism, improper citations, and other forms of unoriginal work are subject to disciplinary actions. Faculty are held responsible for explaining all assignments as thoroughly and clearly as possible, and must be willing to investigate and, if circumstances warrant, press charges against students suspected of academic dishonesty.\n\nIf a student is suspected to have committed academic dishonesty, he or she must undergo a process of warnings, reports, conferences, and Judicial Board hearings based on the severity of the action. While the board decides the institutional punishment (academic probation, suspension, etc.), the instructor of the student's course will determine the student's grade in the course.\n\nAny student found responsible for a third offense of academic dishonesty will be expelled from the university with the action noted on the student's transcript.\n\nGardner–Webb is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.\n\nIn addition several departmental programs are accredited by the appropriate state or national agencies. The education program is accredited by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).

The student body is approximately 60% female and 40% male and the racial makeup of the student body is 66% White, 15% Black, and 3% Hispanic.\n\nGardner–Webb gives its students a variety of residential opportunities on campus, with nine residence halls, three suite style buildings, and seven apartment buildings. All undergraduate students are required to live on campus unless they live with family, are at least 21 years of age prior to an academic year, have lived in a residence hall for at least six semesters, are part-time students (taking less than 12 hours), are married, or have served in 120 days of active military service.\n\nThe residence halls are separated by sex, with women living in Decker, Spangler, Myers, H.A.P.Y., Nanney, and Stroup. Men live in Lutz-Yelton, Mauney, and Royster. Currently, the student body is 63% female and 37% male. The dormitories are equipped with free washing machines and dryers, community bathrooms, and residence lobbies equipped for lounging and studying.\n\nApartments A, B, C, D, E, F, and H, also known as University Commons, are located near the Lake Hollifield Complex. One building contains 12 apartments, each one with a furnished living area, four furnished single bedrooms, a (free) laundry room, two bathrooms, and a fully equipped kitchen area with an oven, stove, microwave, refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. Although the building is co-ed, each apartment is not.\n\nSuites G, I, and J are located in the same area as the apartments, and are similar to them except that they house eight students per unit instead of four. Each suite contains four bedrooms big enough for two students, two bathrooms, a furnished living room, and a half kitchen with a refrigerator, microwave, and sink.\n\nGardner–Webb offers its students opportunities to become involved in a number of activities and organizations around campus. Students work with the Student Government Association leadership to propose new organizations.\n\nA wide variety of organizations are available, including clubs organized around the arts, politics, performance, sports, spirituality, service and culture. There are also a number of academic honor societies including Beta Beta Beta, Sigma Tau Delta, and Alpha Chi and nationally recognized chapters, such as Fellowship of Christian Athletes, College Republicans, and College Democrats.\n\nGardner–Webb also offers an active Student Government Association (SGA) consisting of an 18-member Senate and five-member executive council. The SGA represents the needs and issues of the students to the university administration and acts as a voice for the students. Members of the SGA also serve on faculty committees and often work hand in hand with university staff. The SGA is also responsible for orchestrating many university events including Homecoming.\n\nGardner–Webb offers multiple recreational activities designed to \"enrich the quality of physical, mental, spiritual, and social life of University community members.\" Fitness classes, like zumba, aerobics, yoga, and dance, are available, as well as individual training sessions offered through the Suttle Wellness Center. The Broyhill Adventure Course, located next to University Commons and Spangler Stadium, offers students a unique outdoor adventure challenge and opportunities to experience climbing and problem solving. The Tucker Student Center also has a three-story tall climbing wall.\n\nThe intramural program offers a variety of individual and team sports during both semesters to accommodate student interests and abilities. Any current student, faculty, or staff member may participate. Sports include beach volleyball, kickball, indoor soccer, disc golf, softball, and basketball, among others. Teams can play under male, female, or coed leagues.\n\nGardner–Webb University's Center for Personal and Professional Development (CPPD) works in partnership with faculty and staff to prepare students for life and work beyond college. The CPPD offers close to 50 programs/events each year including, career and internship fairs, networking events, and workshops on jobs/internship search, resume prep, applying to grad school, interview prep, career exploration, and leadership.\n\nThe Life of the Scholar Multidisciplinary Conference (LOTS-MC) is an academic conference founded in 1997 that is held on campus every year for undergraduate and graduate students to present their work. This conference is divided up into academic fields such as Religion & Philosophy, Natural Sciences, and English Language & Literature to name a few. The field of students is often large and the event lasts all day. At the end of the program, an award is given for the best-written paper by a graduate student, and a prize is given for the best presentation by a graduate student. The 20th Anniversary LOTS-MC was held in 2017 and honored the founders of the conference Dr. Les and Joyce Brown.\n\n\nGardner–Webb offers 21 varsity sports at the NCAA Division I level, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, wrestling, swimming, track and field, cross country, softball, tennis, volleyball, lacrosse, cheerleading, and golf. Ten of these are men's and eleven are women's.\n\nThe athletic teams are known as the Runnin' Bulldogs and support the school colors of scarlet, black and white. The bulldogs are part of the Big South Conference, although the men's and women's swim teams belong to the Coastal Collegiate Swim Association, and the wrestling team belongs to the Southern Conference.\n\n\nAs a Baptist founded university, Gardner–Webb offers and exhibits many Christian aspects. The Office of Christian Life and Service encourages and challenges the university community in its Christian growth, offering pastoral care to students, faculty, administration and staff. It provides vocational counseling and referral service to students interested in church related vocations as well, and coordinates the planning of worship services held for the university and community, like the Dimensions program. The Office hopes that \"through ministry organizations, students are encouraged and challenged in personal discipleship, corporate worship, and life-changing ministry and mission experiences.\" \n\nDimensions is a graduation requirement for all Gardner–Webb students. The purpose is to nurture attendants spiritually, intellectually and culturally from the perspective of a Christian world view and to promote a sense of community. The program is offered every Tuesday during both the Fall and Spring semesters and counts as 1/2 credit hour. A new speaker addresses the university every week, ranging from staff and faculty to artists, professional athletes, and political speakers, all of whom address subjects that relate to the school's core Christian beliefs. Students must attend 10 sessions each semester for four semesters to obtain all of the Dimensions credits needed to graduate, having a total of 2 credit hours in the course by the end of their academic careers. Credit is given on a pass/fail basis. This means that a total of four semesters, or 40 dimensions, must be attended before graduation.\n\nCampus Ministries United is an umbrella association that has worked with Gardner–Webb to create student run ministry groups. Each CMU Council is composed of student leaders who well represent the ideas of Christian Life and Service. Along with the university's ministerial staff, the Council seeks to \"promote a passionate and enduring devotion to Christ among students of Gardner–Webb.\" Student Ministries supports student-led worship services like The Verge, which welcomes all students to worship with others through music, speakers, drama, and fellowship. F.O.C.U.S. Ministries (Fellowship of Christians United in Service), is another program that consists of teams of students who are involved with leading youth retreats locally and regionally.\n\nThroughout Gardner-Webb's history, local, national and international Christian mission opportunities have been provided for students, faculty and staff. From disaster relief efforts, to medical service, to rebuilding broken communities, the Office of Christian Life and Service has become the home for managing and coordinating trips to assist communities in need each year.\n\n"}

The decoration of the topmost part of a building was particularly important in ancient Greek architecture and this came to be seen as typifying the \"Attica\" style, the earliest example known being that of the monument of Thrasyllus in Athens.\n\nIt was largely employed in Ancient Rome, where their triumphal arches utilized it for inscriptions or for bas-relief sculpture. It was used also to increase the height of enclosure walls such as those of the Forum of Nerva. By the Italian revivalists it was utilized as a complete storey, pierced with windows, as found in Andrea Palladio's work in Vicenza and in Greenwich Hospital, London. One well-known large attic surmounts the entablature of St. Peter's Basilica, which measures in height.\n\nThis usage became current in the 17th century from the use of \"Attica\" style pilasters as adornments on the top story's façade. By the 18th century this meaning had been transferred to the space behind the wall of the highest story (i.e., directly under the roof), producing the modern meaning of the word \"attic\".\n\n"}

Established in 1968, Zayed Port is in the northeast section of Abu Dhabi city. It was officially inaugurated and became fully operational in 1972, and is named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the former President of the United Arab Emirates. The transfer of Zayed Port's container traffic to the newly developed US$7.2 billion Khalifa Port container terminal was completed in 2012.\n\nZayed Port covers an area of 535 hectares and contains 21 berths with depths ranging from 6 to 15 metres and a total berth length of 4,375 metres. It's one of four major ports in the emirate: the city's Zayed Port remains the gateway for general cargo vessels, RORO (roll-on/roll-off) and is emerging as a destination for international luxury cruise ship tourism; the nearby Free Port caters to smaller vessels, tugs, barges and service crafts; Musaffah Port is located in the heart of the industrial township of Musaffah; while the new state-of-the-art Khalifa Port in Taweelah handles all the emirate's container shipping.\n\nIn light of the increasing importance of container shipping, a well-equipped container terminal was established at Zayed Port back in 1982. Covering an area of 41 hectares, the terminal had a storage capacity of 15,000 TEUs at any given time. Four deep water berths were provided with a total length of 931 metres and 15 metres depth. The berths were equipped with five 40-tonne cranes. As a result, Zayed Port's throughput in 1998 increased 34 per cent in container volume and 25 per cent in general cargo over 1997. The port's capacity to hold chilled, cool and frozen products was significantly increased when a 15,000 tone cold store became operational in 1999.\n\nBenefiting from its strategic location in the heart of the capital, Zayed Port was instrumental in bolstering Abu Dhabi’s international trade, being the main gateway for trade in the emirate and playing a pivotal role in supporting Abu Dhabi’s Economic Vision 2030, the government’s drive to achieve economic diversification.\n\nAs part of this vision, all container shipping in Zayed Port was eventually moved to the Abu Dhabi Ports' newly developed AED 26.5 billion AED (USD 7.2 billion) megaproject Khalifa Port in Taweelah between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Following the 100% TEU traffic transition from Zayed Port in September 2012, commercial operations at this new flagship state-of-the-art gateway were officially inaugurated by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 12 December 2012.\n\nZayed Port is now the focus of the Abu Dhabi Ports's plans to redevelop the port as a major luxury cruise ship terminal. Abu Dhabi is currently a seasonal home port for AIDA Cruises, while Celebrity Cruises announced in December 2014 that they would be home porting their cruise ship Celebrity Constellation in Abu Dhabi from November, 2016 to January 2017.\n\nIn 2014 the Red Bull Air Race World Championship season opened in Zayed Port. This was the seventh occasion the competition was hosted in Abu Dhabi and marked the first time the city saw the event since 2010, when it had hosted the opener for six consecutive years starting from 2005.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2210652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210652", "title": "Saint-Gaudens double eagle", "text": "Saint-Gaudens double eagle\n\nThe Saint-Gaudens double eagle is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or double eagle, produced by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It is considered by many to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins.\n\nIn 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage, and proposed Saint-Gaudens as an artist capable of the task. Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver, Charles E. Barber, Saint-Gaudens accepted Roosevelt's call. The work was subject to considerable delays, due to Saint-Gaudens's declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design. Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, after designing the eagle and double eagle, but before the designs were finalized for production.\n\nAfter several versions of the design for the double eagle proved too difficult to strike, Barber modified Saint-Gaudens's design, lowering the relief so the coin could be struck with only one blow. When the coins were finally released, they proved controversial as they lacked the words \"In God We Trust\", and Congress intervened to require the motto's use. The coin was minted, primarily for use in international trade, until 1933. The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins, with the sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for $7,590,020.\n\nThe double eagle, or twenty-dollar gold piece, was first issued in 1850; its congressional authorization was a response to the increasing amount of gold available as the result of the California Gold Rush. The resulting Liberty Head double eagle, designed by Mint Engraver James Longacre, was struck for the remainder of the 19th century, though the design was modified several times. The double eagle, due to its very high face value, equivalent to several hundred dollars today, did not widely circulate, but was the coin most often used for large international transactions, in which settlement was to be in gold. In the West, where gold or silver coins were preferred to paper money—use of which was illegal in California in the aftermath of the Gold Rush—the coins saw some circulation.\n\nSculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens's first association with the Mint was in 1891, when he served on a committee judging entries for the new silver coinage. The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner, and all invited artists (including St. Gaudens himself) refused to submit entries. The competition was open to the public, and the judging committee (which consisted of Saint-Gaudens, Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber, and commercial engraver Henry Mitchell) found no entry suitable. This came as no surprise to Saint-Gaudens, who told Mint Director Edward O. Leech that there were only four men in the world capable of such work, of whom three were in France and Saint-Gaudens was the fourth. Barber, who had been Chief Engraver since 1879, felt that Saint-Gaudens overstated the case, and there was only one man capable of such coinage work—Barber himself. Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar, resulting in the Barber coinage, an issue which attracted considerable public dissatisfaction.\n\nIn 1892, Saint-Gaudens was asked to design the official medal of the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago; it would be presented to prizewinning exhibitors. The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's design, showing Columbus coming ashore, was noncontroversial; his reverse, which featured a torch-bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown the victors, was attacked by the censoring postal agent, Anthony Comstock, as obscene. The exposition directors hastily withdrew the reverse design and replaced it with one created by Barber which, according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, was \"notable only for banality\". A furious Saint-Gaudens swore to have nothing more to do with the Mint or its employees, and for the next decade refused all commissions which might involve him with that bureau.\n\nOn December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a personal friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: \"I think the state of our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?\" Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, \"I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage ... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work.\" Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.\n\nIn November 1905, Roosevelt wrote to Saint-Gaudens to enquire how the gold coinage was progressing. The President mentioned that he had been looking at gold coins of Ancient Greece, and that the most beautiful ones were in high relief. Roosevelt suggested that the new designs could be in high relief, with a high rim to protect them. Saint-Gaudens replied agreeing with Roosevelt, and proposing a design for the double eagle\nsome kind of a (possibly winged) figure of Liberty, striding forward as if on a mountaintop, holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing the stars and stripes with the word Liberty marked across the field; in the other hand perhaps a flaming torch, the drapery [of Liberty's dress] would be flowing in the breeze. My idea is to make it a \"living\" thing, and typical of progress.\n\nOn January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was practical on coins struck at the Mint. Shaw did not immediately reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote that there was no objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, \"as artistic as the Greeks could desire\". Roosevelt secured Shaw's support for the redesign, although as the President wrote to Saint-Gaudens, \"of course he thinks I am a crack-brained lunatic on the subject\". Shaw wrote to the sculptor on , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned, \"the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief\", but as the President disagreed with Roberts's view, Saint-Gaudens could go ahead with a high-relief design. Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented, \"This is also one of those times when the compelling egos of artist and President might have paid greater attention to director Roberts' comments. By continuing with the design in a relief that was not coinable, Saint-Gaudens lost his best chance to explore the limits of artistry on circulation coinage.\"\n\nSaint-Gaudens wrote to Roosevelt later in January, \"Whatever I produce cannot be worse than the inanities now displayed on our coins.\" However, Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber, who \"has been in that institution since the foundation of the government, and will be found standing in its ruins\". In , the sculptor wrote to Roosevelt that he had sent an assistant to Washington to obtain the technical details of the redesign, but \"if you succeed in getting the best of the polite Mr. Barber or the others in charge, you will have done a greater work than putting through the Panama Canal. Nevertheless, I will stick at it, even unto death.\"\n\nIn May 1906, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Secretary Shaw, asking if there was any objection to having the date in Roman numerals. Shaw replied, \"While we are making coins for the people of the United States, I think we should confine ourselves to the English language. I have reminded our architects that I will dismiss the first one who puts a V on a public building where a U is intended.\" However, Roosevelt overruled Shaw, and the sculptor proceeded with the use of Roman numerals.\nSaint-Gaudens had intended a flying eagle design for the cent, but developed it for the twenty-dollar piece after learning that by law, an eagle was not to appear on the cent. Saint-Gaudens's health worsened through 1906, as the cancer which would kill him forced him to have his assistant, Henry Hering, deal with many of the details of the work. Saint-Gaudens had the models for the coins made in Paris, rather than at the Mint, in order to bypass any obstruction by the Mint. It was not until that Roosevelt was finally given coin-sized models of Saint-Gaudens's work by Hering, and Roosevelt wrote to the ailing sculptor, \"I have instructed the Director of the Mint that these dies are to be reproduced just as quickly as possible and just as they are. It is simply splendid. I suppose I shall be impeached for it by Congress, but I shall regard that as a very cheap payment!\"\n\nThe obverse of Saint-Gaudens's final design shows a female figure of Liberty, who also represents victory. Saint-Gaudens based his design on the female figure he had designed in creating New York City's monument to General William Tecumseh Sherman, but the sculptor's ultimate inspiration was the Nike of Samothrace. The figure for the Sherman monument was modeled by Henrietta Anderson, one of the artist's favorite subjects. On the coin, Liberty holds a torch in one hand, representing enlightenment; an olive branch in the other, a symbol of peace. She strides across a rocky outcrop; behind her are the United States Capitol and the rays of the Sun. The figure is surrounded by 46 stars, one for each of the states in 1907. The reverse is a side view of a flying eagle, seen slightly from below, with a rising Sun and its rays behind it, complementing the obverse design. The edge bears the lettering \"E Pluribus Unum\". Saint-Gaudens felt he could not place a third line of text on the reverse without unbalancing the composition, and the obverse lacked room for the motto, so it was placed on the edge.\n\nMint Engraver Barber had closely followed the progress of the proposed recoinage, and wrote to Acting Mint Director Robert Preston on , 1906:\n[Saint-Gaudens] talks so much about experiments, it may be to him, but to us it is no experiment, as we are just as certain that the relief of his eagle will never coin, as we are certain that the Sun will rise each morning, and the only object in all this trouble and waste of money is to convince those who will be convinced in no other way ... I think our friend [Saint-Gaudens] is playing a game ... but our willingness, nay more, our desire to let the work tell its own story has rather called his hand, and he is not prepared to show it, and therefore is sparing for wind, or time.\nIn response to Barber's letter, Preston wrote to Saint-Gaudens, \"there are no presses anywhere, in mints or in use among silversmiths, which can bring up your proposed relief at a single stroke.\" When the models were brought to the Mint, Barber examined and rejected them. It was only after considerable discussion that he agreed to experiment. At that time, the Mint was intensely busy generating designs for new coinage for Cuba and the Philippines, and Barber was reluctant to waste time on what he considered an experimental piece which would never be coined for circulation. Experimental dies were made from the plaster model. Approximately 24 pieces were struck as patterns; even though the Mint used a medal press, set for maximum pressure, it still took up to nine strokes of the press to fully bring out the design. These patterns are today known as the \"Ultra High Relief\" or \"Extra High Relief\" pieces, and only about 20 are known—one sold in a 2005 auction for $2,990,000. On , 1907, the President wrote Saint-Gaudens, \"It has proved hitherto impossible to strike them by one blow, which is necessary under the conditions of making coins of the present day.\" On , 1907, Saint-Gaudens replied, \"I am grieved that the striking of the die did not bring better results. Evidently it is no trifling matter to make Greek art conform with modern numismatics.\"\n\nA second set of dies was produced with the relief reduced somewhat, but still proved too high relief for practical coining, requiring three strokes of the press to fully bring out the design. Saint-Gaudens had produced the models for these dies under the misapprehension that the first pieces had been struck on a production press, rather than on the Mint's only medal press, and therefore only slight adjustment need be made. When Saint-Gaudens died on , 1907, Hering was working on a third model. Uncertain where to find Hering, Roosevelt ordered the new Secretary of the Treasury, George Cortelyou, to have the Mint finalize the design and put the coin in circulation by . Barber was recalled from his vacation in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, to comply with the President's order. Barber wrote Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis on that what Roosevelt wanted was impossible; he had no dies nor any clear idea of how Saint-Gaudens had planned to reduce the relief. The Mint chief engraver alleged that he could take no action with respect to the double eagle. On , Hering finally appeared at the Mint with a new set of models, which Barber again quickly rejected. Barber wrote to Preston, \"Upon examination it was found that the relief of the models was so great that it would be a waste of time to make reductions for coinage, as it would be quite impossible to coin when the dies are made.\" Instead, Barber began work on his own low relief version of Saint-Gaudens's design.\n\nIn August 1907, Roosevelt nominated San Francisco Mint Superintendent Frank Leach as Director of the Mint; he took office on , 1907. In his memoirs, Leach recalled his initial interview with Roosevelt on the question of the double eagles:\nBefore I had become familiar with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon in the way of the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.\n\nOn November 18, the impatient Roosevelt directed that the second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to \"begin the new issue, even if it takes you all day to strike one piece!\" Over 12,000 of these \"High Relief\" pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908. Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis, \"Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and I send you two pieces showing the result; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two, which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin.\" Barber completed work on his version of the design, with a greatly lowered relief, and the new coin went into production on a large-scale basis. A total of 361,667 of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907; the \"Low Relief\" coins were released into circulation at the end of . Barber's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor's family and by Hering. Among other alterations, Barber changed the Roman numeral MCMVII for the date to the Arabic numeral \"1907\". In spite of the modifications, according to R.S. Yeoman in his \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\", many consider the Saint-Gaudens double eagles the most beautiful of U.S. coins.\n\nIn his book discussing the redesigns of U.S. coins between 1905 and 1908, Burdette casts blame on all parties for the delays in the new coin:\nResponsibility for most of the delays in producing the new coinage must fall on the Saint-Gaudens studio for failing to deliver models in a timely manner. The mint failed in its responsibility to clearly communicate to the President and artist its limitations and technical requirements for large-scale coinage. President Roosevelt, likewise, must bear responsibility for constantly confusing the project with conflicting or incomplete communication to the artist and Mint Bureau.\nDespite the difficulties with the design, Roosevelt was very pleased with the new double eagle. Mint Director Leach recalled that when \"I laid upon his desk a sample of beautifully executed double eagles of the Saint-Gaudens design, he was most enthusiastic in his expressions of pleasure and satisfaction. I certainly believed him when he declared he was 'delighted'. He warmly congratulated me on my success, and was most complimentary in his comments.\" In , the President wrote to his friend, Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow:\nI am very much pleased that you like that coin. I shall have all kinds of trouble over it, but I do feel what you say is true: that is, that it is the best coin that has been struck for two thousand years, and that no matter what is its temporary fate, it will serve as a model for future coin makers, and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted.\nRoosevelt had specifically requested Saint-Gaudens not to put \"In God We Trust\" on the new coin, feeling that the motto's presence on coins was a debasement of God's name, as the coins might be spent to further criminal activities. Saint-Gaudens was quite willing to omit the motto, as he felt the words detracted from the design elements. There was a public outcry about the omission of the motto, and what Breen describes as an \"outraged and furious\" Congress ordered the motto to appear. Barber duly modified the coin to include the motto, taking the opportunity to make several minor changes to the design, which, according to Breen, do not improve the coin. In 1912, two more stars were added to the obverse to reflect the admission of New Mexico and Arizona to the Union. The existing stars were not adjusted in position; the two new ones were placed on the outcropping at the lower right.\n\nThe only major variety of the series occurred in 1909, an overdate in which an 8 shows under the final nine in the date. This most likely happened when a 1908 die was struck by a 1909-dated hub, creating the overdate. Perhaps half of the 161,282 double eagles struck at Philadelphia that year display the overdate.\n\nIn 1916, minting of double eagles ceased, as bullion prices were rising because of World War I, which also caused an influx of American gold coins from Europe. Holders of gold coin, such as banks, refused to pay them out at par value, and they vanished from circulation. In the aftermath of the war, international demand for the coin was restored; many Europeans distrusted their local currencies and desired double eagles to hold. The coin was struck in large numbers once coinage was resumed in 1920, but it was now almost exclusively a coin of international trade, or was held by banks as backing for gold certificates. The coin itself rarely circulated in the United States. The onset of the Depression in 1929 did not halt the minting of double eagles, but the coins were for the most part held in Treasury vaults, and few were released. Many of the great rarities of the Saint-Gaudens series stem from its final years. Despite a mintage of almost 1.8 million pieces of the 1929 double eagle, it is estimated that fewer than 2,000 exist today, with all the rest melted by the government in the late 1930s.\n\nAccording to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, the first 1933 double eagles were struck on March 2, 1933. On , 1933, 25,000 new double eagles were delivered to Mint Cashier Harry Powell, and by longstanding Mint custom, were available for paying out. On , however, the newly inaugurated president, Franklin Roosevelt, had ordered the Treasury not to pay out any gold, and ordered that banks holding gold transmit it to their Federal Reserve bank. Numismatists and coin dealers were still allowed to possess and deal in gold coins; all others required a special license. The double eagle continued to be struck until May. On , 1933, Acting Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau ordered Americans to turn in all gold coins and gold certificates, with limited exceptions, receiving paper money in payment. Millions of gold coins were melted down by the Treasury in the following years. Two 1933 double eagles were sent by the Mint to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Coin Collection, where they remain today.\n\nProminent coin dealer and numismatic writer Q. David Bowers suggests that despite the ban on paying out gold, examples of the 1933 double eagle could have been obtained legally from Mint Cashier Powell in an exchange for earlier double eagles. Bowers also notes that Secretary of the Treasury William Woodin was a numismatist who in addition to collecting coins, had written books on the subject. Dealer William Nagy later recalled visiting Secretary Woodin and being shown five 1933 double eagles, with the secretary stating that he had several more.\n\nBy the early 1940s, between eight and ten specimens were known; two of them were sold by Texas dealer B. Max Mehl. In 1944, a journalist enquired of the Mint regarding the 1933 double eagles. Mint officials could find no record of any issuance of the coins, and decided those in private hands must have been obtained illegally. Over the next few years, the Secret Service seized a number of specimens, which were subsequently melted. One piece, however, wound up in the hands of King Farouk of Egypt, who even obtained a U.S. export license for the coin. What became of the Farouk specimen after his death is unclear, but the coin resurfaced in the late 1990s. When brought to New York for sale to a prospective buyer, it was seized by U.S. authorities. After litigation, a compromise was reached to allow the coin to be auctioned, with the proceeds to be divided equally between the government and the private owners. In 2002 this coin sold at auction by Sotheby's for $7,590,020. The purchase price included $20 paid to the federal government to monetize a coin it contended had never been officially released.\n\nIn 2004, 10 specimens of the 1933 double eagle were submitted to the Mint for authentication by the heirs of a Philadelphia jeweler who may have been involved in obtaining them from the Mint in 1933. The Mint authenticated them, and refused to give them back. The heirs brought suit against the government in 2006, and a federal judge ordered the government to file a forfeiture action regarding the coins. The government brought such a suit in 2009; it was tried in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania beginning on July 7, 2011. On July 21, 2011, a jury decided that the coins had been properly seized by the Federal government. Judge Legrome D. Davis confirmed that jury verdict on August 29, 2012. On April 17, 2015, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the government had failed to file its forfeiture action in a timely manner, and that the heirs were entitled to the coins. That ruling was vacated by the full court on July 28, 2015, and the case set for further argument. On August 1, 2016, the full Third Circuit ruled in favor of the government, upholding the jury verdict. The heirs, on November 4 of that year, asked the Supreme Court to review the case, which refused to hear it on April 21, 2017, ending the case.\n\nThe obverse has appeared on American gold bullion coinage issued since 1986. Saint-Gaudens's original design was reused, with two stars added next to the two which Barber had added in 1912, recognizing the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the Union. Saint-Gaudens's reverse was not used, yielding its place to sculptor Miley Busiek's depiction of a family of eagles.\n\nIn 1907, the Mint had experimented by striking about two dozen pieces of the same weight as the double eagle, bearing Saint-Gaudens's design, but which had a smaller, thicker planchet. These \"checker\" pieces were destroyed (except two placed in the Mint's coin collection) when it was discovered that the consent of Congress was needed to change the diameter of any coin. In 2009, the Mint struck a similar piece in .999 gold, using Saint-Gaudens's original ultra high relief design for both sides of the coin, though modified to a 50-star obverse. These pieces contain one ounce of gold, slightly more than the original double eagle.\n\nThe mintmark appears above the date between the second and third numbers.\n\n\nThe mintages are in many cases not a true indication of relative rarity. Coins remaining in bank vaults in the United States were melted after 1933; coins in bank vaults overseas were not. Millions of double eagles, of both the Liberty Head and Saint-Gaudens designs, were repatriated for numismatic and investment purposes once it was legal to do so. By way of example, the 1924 Saint-Gaudens double eagle was once thought to be rare although 4,323,500 were struck; when the Mint offered a list of coins available at face value plus postage in 1932, the 1924 was not on that list. Large quantities of 1924 double eagles were found in European bank vaults, and today the 1924 is one of the most common of the series. On the other hand, the 1925-S had 3,776,500 struck, but few were released or exported, remaining in Treasury and bank vaults—but available from the Treasury at face value in 1932. Fewer than a thousand are known to have survived; one, in almost-perfect condition (graded MS-67) sold in 2005 for $287,500.\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

Brown (\"Charlie Brown\") was a lead engineer on the project, which started in 1951. The project initially examined the feasibility of constructing a transistorized airborne digital computer. A second application was a transistorized digital computer to be used in a Navy track-while-scan shipboard radar system. Several models were completed: TRADIC Phase One computer, Flyable TRADIC, Leprechaun (using germanium alloy junction transistors in 1956) and XMH-3 TRADIC. TRADIC Phase One was developed to explore the feasibility, in the laboratory, of using transistors in a digital computer that could be used to solve aircraft bombing and navigation problems. Flyable TRADIC was used to establish the feasibility of using an airborne solid-state computer as the control element of a bombing and navigation system. Leprechaun was a second-generation laboratory research transistor digital computer designed to explore direct-coupled transistor logic (DCTL). The TRADIC Phase One computer was completed in January 1954.\n\nThe TRADIC Phase One computer has been claimed to be the world's first fully transistorized computer, ahead of the Mailüfterl in Austria or the Harwell CADET in the UK, which were each completed in 1955. In the UK, the Manchester University Transistor Computer demonstrated a working prototype in 1953 which incorporated transistors before TRADIC was operational, although that was not a fully transistorized computer because it used vacuum tubes to generate the clock signal. The 30 watts of power for the 1 MHz clock in the TRADIC was also supplied by a vacuum tube supply because no transistors were available that could supply that much power at that frequency. If the TRADIC can be called fully transistorized while incorporating vacuum tubes, then the Manchester University Transistor Computer should also be, in which case that is the first transistorized computer and not the TRADIC. If neither can be called fully transistorized, then the CADET was the first \"fully\" transistorised computer in February 1955.\n\nFlyable TRADIC also incorporated a single high-power output vacuum-tube amplifier to supply clock power to the system. The designers originally devised a system clock using a crystal-controlled transistor oscillator driving a multitude of transistor amplifiers because each transistor was too low powered, but since the phase shift of the amplifiers could not be controlled to the required tolerances this had to be abandoned. So by the same criterion of incorporating vacuum tubes the flyable TRADIC was either not a fully transistorized computer, or followed the Manchester University Transistor Computer in 1953. In contrast, the operating requirements for the Flyable TRADIC included performing across a wide temperature range of -55 °C (-67 °F) to +55 °C (+131 °F).\n\nThe TRADIC Phase One Computer had 684 Bell Labs Type 1734 Type A cartridge transistors and 10,358 germanium point-contact diodes. The TRADIC was small and light enough to be installed in a B-52 Stratofortress. It was a general-purpose computer. Programs for the TRADIC Phase One Computer were introduced via a removable plugboard, while the Flyable TRADIC used a Mylar sheet with punched holes — a system reminiscent of punched-card storage. TRADIC could perform a million logical operations every second, close to but not as fast the vacuum tube computers of the day, using its 1 MHz clock. It operated on less than 100 watts of power and it was much more reliable than its vacuum tube predecessors.\n\n"}

It offers a mix of news and syndicated talk, featuring programming from Fox News Radio and Premiere Radio Networks.\n\nKQNT is one of the oldest radio stations in the United States. It was first licensed in February 1922 as KHQ in Seattle, Washington, before moving to Spokane, Washington in 1925.\n\nKQNT airs a live local morning show from 5-9 a.m., and receives hourly news updates from Fox News Radio and local news, traffic, and weather updates from KHQ-TV 6, Spokane's NBC TV affiliate. The station's talk shows include Rush Limbaugh, Dave Ramsey, Glenn Beck, America Now with Andy Dean, and Coast to Coast AM, all distributed by Clear Channel's Premiere Radio Networks.\n\nKQNT's first license, with the randomly assigned call letters KHQ, was issued to Louis Wasmer in Seattle on February 28, 1922, for operation on the 360 meter (833 kHz) \"entertainment\" wavelength. Wasmer was a former United Wireless Telegraph Company radiotelegraph operator, who had opened the Excelsior Motorcycle and Bicycle Co. in 1911, and also sold radio equipment. Following two weeks of transmitter adjustment, the station made its debut broadcast on February 27, 1922. Its initial schedule was phonograph music presented every evening between 7 and 8:30. \n\nKHQ was the second Seattle station licensed following the formal establishment of a broadcasting service category on December 1, 1921 by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the regulators of radio at this time. The first Seattle station licensed under these new regulations was KFC on December 8, 1921, which was operated jointly by the Northern Radio and Electric Company and the \"Post-Intelligencer\" newspaper. A third Seattle station, Vincent I. Kraft's KJR didn't receive a broadcasting station license until March 9, 1922. However Kraft had begun broadcasting over an experimental station beginning in 1920, thus, when KHQ debuted it was described by a local newspaper as \"the third broadcaster\".\n\nIn March KHQ suspended operations for nearly two weeks, returning with a 50-watt transmitter that replaced the original 10-watt set, which had been sold to the Economy Market so it could establish station KZC.\n\nBecause initially there was only the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters available for use by multiple stations, regions had to set up a timesharing agreement to allocate individual station timeslots. On November 28, 1922 KHQ had the fewest programs of four listed stations, with a schedule of 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nIn January 1925, KHQ began broadcasting from a studio located at the Bush & Lane Piano Company store on Third Avenue, and the station also moved to 1100 kHz.\n\nIn May 1925 it was announced that KHQ was temporarily going off the air in order to give Bush & Lane time to \"make extensive alterations in the studio\", in addition to a major facility upgrade. Instead, after broadcasting for three years in Seattle, Wasmer relocated the station to Spokane, reportedly transporting the radio equipment in a motorcycle sidecar. KHQ was Spokane's fifth radio station, preceded by stations KFZ, KOE, KFIO (now KSBN) and KFPY (now KXLY), although only KFIO and KFPY were still licensed at the time of KHQ's arrival.\n\nPart of the move included an upgrade from 100 to 1,000 watts, although the station remained on 1100 kHz. KHQ's Spokane debut on October 30, 1925, from the Davenport Hotel, was made with great fanfare. Announcer Frank \"Spark Plug\" Buhlert told listeners that \"The first 500 persons who send telegrams or phone in that they have heard the program will receive a souvenir bag of ore from the world's largest lead mine, the Bunker Hill & Sullivan, at Kellogg, Idaho.\" The debut broadcast ran from 8 p.m. to midnight, and included assorted speeches and music.\n\nWasmer moved the station's studios and office across Post Street from the Davenport Hotel to the seventh floor of Spokane Stock Exchange Building (also called the Eilers Building) in 1928 because the fledgling station had outgrown its quarters in the hotel. KGA later joined KHQ in the building, which was subsequently renamed the Radio Central Building. \n\nKHQ changed its transmitting frequency a number of times in the mid-twenties, until November 11, 1928, when, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, it was reassigned to 590 kHz which it and its successors have used ever since.\n\nThe August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission's \"duopoly\" rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market. At this time Louis Wasmer, Inc. owned two Spokane stations: KHQ and KGA. To conform with the FCC order, in 1946 Wasmer sold KHQ to the Cowles Publishing Company, publisher of \"The Spokesman-Review\" newspaper, which used it to launch an FM station (now KISC) and a television station (which still bears the KHQ-TV calls). KHQ stayed in the Radio Central Building until 1960, when it moved to a modern facility next to its transmitter site on South Regal on the Moran Prairie.\n\nCowles sold off its radio interests in 1984; on New Year's Day 1985, and kept the historic KHQ call letters for its TV station. Because of a FCC rule in place at the time that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market but with different ownership from sharing the same call letters, AM 590 changed its call to KLSN, with the slogan \"Listen 5-90\".\n\nOn December 1, 1986 the station changed its call sign to KAQQ, which was phonetically similar to the original KHQ call letters.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2002 the call letters became KQNT.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in July 1897, making it one of the oldest schools in Malaysia. It is known as MBS and its students are known as MBSians. The school is also known as Horley School, a reference to one of its principals, Rev. William E. Horley, who was responsible for changing and giving the school its present name from the previous name of Anglo-Tamil School. The name Horley School has been widely misunderstood as a reference to marble, which is also called Horley in Chinese, a game that was popular amongst its students then. It is noted for its library, which attracts visits from many other schools.\n\nThe school was founded by Christian missionary Dr. Kensett in July 1897. The school population grew to be overwhelmingly Indian and the school was named Anglo-Tamil School, at a small wooden shophouse at the corner of Batu Road and Java Street, since demolished.\n\nIn 1899, Rev. Abraham became its first headmaster, leading a staff of four teachers. It was then registered as a government-aided school.\n\nThree years later, the MBS proper was founded by Rev. W. E. Horley at the temporary premises of an unused pork market in Malacca Street. The Anglo-Tamil School was absorbed into it, opening up the school to all races.\n\nIn 1904, the school decided to move to Petaling Hill (its present site) after a few evacuations by the sanitary board due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings. Within eight months, enough funds had been collected to erect a new building. Two new wings were constructed and a playing field laid down. In 2008, Methodist Boys' Secondary School was awarded cluster school status by the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MOE).\n\nThe School Song was composed in 1948 by former principal, Mr. Hugh F. Clancy. The music was harmonised by N.Swan, in the same year. The school anthem was sung over Radio Malaya in 1949 by the school choir.\n\nGo forward MBS\nFilled with courage fine\nWith your colours flying\nWe will cheer you all the time\nAnd so you go forward MBS\nOn to victory\nWork for the fame of our fair name\nForward we must play the game\n\nThe Malay Version was drafted during a competition to translate the school song in Malay in which Cheok Heng Wai of 5 Mori (1995), at that time, won the competition and this was the lyrics that followed.\n\nThe Song was translated into the national language in 1995.\n\nMajulah MBS\nPenuh azam baru\nDengan semangat waja\nKita menjulangkan namamu\nMajulah MBS\nRaih kejayaan\nHarumkan namamu selalu\nKekalkan keunggulan\n\nSource: Excelsior 1954 and Excelsior 2006\n\nThe school badge consists of the words \"MBS\" and a banner in Or Yellow against a background shield of Azure Blue. Azure Blue, represents the fact that all humanity shares the same sky and a sense of togetherness. It represents the harmony of all the races in MBSSKL, and that the importance of each individual is recognised. Whereas, Or Yellow, represents the excellence for which we are encouraged to strive for.\n\nThe school crest has changed somewhat throughout the years especially on the removal of a \"white cross\" upon which the text \"MBS\" once sat. The removal of the cross was initially made in deference to Muslim students in the school who would specifically wear the \"cross-less\" version of the badge. (The badges of convent schools which featured a prominent cross had to be completely redesigned.) Politically, Malaysia was developing into a primarily Muslim country with a multi-racial, multi-ethnic population who have long learnt to exist among each other with tolerance. The permanent removal of the cross in 1989 reflects this subtle shift in the country's sensitivity to the Muslim community.\n\nThe shape of the bar in which the motto sits has been morphed over the years. The most recent crest shows that the bar curves down on both sides and extends beyond the crest body. The original crest that was last used in the mid-nineteen seventies had it pointed up at both the edges and is shorter than the crest body.\n\nThe motto, \"Ora et Labora\" means \"Pray and Work\" in Latin.\n\nSource: Excelsior 2004\n\nThe school magazine of the MBSSKL is named the Excelsior. It was published annually by the Excelsior Editorial Board since 1906 to the late 1910s where it was discontinued before being revived by Dr. Ho Seng Ong in the early 1920s, then still a student in the school before becoming a principal later. It is one of the oldest school magazines in the entire country. The first school magazine which was published in the year 1906 is still in the possession of the school's archive and principal. In 2007, the Excelsior magazine was awarded as the best school magazine in the country.\n\nThe MBSSKL Library is supposedly the oldest school library in the country. The Library was founded in 1906, by philanthropist Mr. Eu Tong Sen of Perak, the youngest son of Mr. Eu Kong, founder of Eu Yan Sang company.\n\nIn 1937, the library was renamed the Lum Mun Yoke Memorial Library.\n\nIn 1941, war broke out and left the library in shambles.\n\nIn 1947, the library was revived by former principal Mr. S. Kanagaratnam (Acting). At the early stages of revival, only senior students were allowed to use the library while the library masters were working hard to restore the condition of the library.\n\nInitially, during these stages, the library was separated into three libraries, namely the Students' Library, the Form Six Library and the Staff Library. The library was at that time located directly above the principal's office, which according to sources, was located at the Hinch Block.\n\nIn 1957, Students who were voluntary helpers were formally given the title \"Student Librarians\". In 1962, the Student Librarians were formally recognised as \"The Board of Student Librarians\" and were given the privilege of wearing a light blue shirt to distinguish themselves from the rest of the students, hence earning them the name \"Lightblues\". Before this, no other Student Librarian body in the country had the honour of wearing a special distinctive uniform. Special badges were given out as well. Until today, the Board of Student Librarians has still retained their traditional white and lightblue uniform, with the addition of a dark blue blazer, which is the highest honour given to student leaders. Only the 2 most distinguished boards of the school have been given permission to don dark blue (The School Colour), while the rest of the Boards have no blazers or black blazers.\n\nIn the 60s also, the libraries were once again centralised to form the MBSSKL Central Library. The Central Library was relocated to the top floor of the T. Mori Block. The school library also earned the distinction of being one of the first libraries in town to enjoy central air conditioning and had a fine collection of reference books. This is proved by the fact that the Central Library was a popular place for Methodites to study in and was opened on weekdays. The Central Library also occasionally opened during Saturdays until 6 pm.\n\nIn 1962, the library was designated a \"model school library\". Many other schools have visited the MBSSKL library to learn from its library, including schools from as far as Thailand. The visitors were never disappointed with the standard of the library, which was considered to be among the most well-equipped school library in the nation in that era.\n\nIn 2006, the library shifted to its current premises on top floor of the Tan Sri Dato' Seri(Dr) Lim Goh Tong block. It is located in a big hall known as the Wong Chee Kooi room and Reunion 5971 room, and the library itself is called the Centenary Library. It is administrated by the Board of Student Librarians, and the Junior Board of Student Librarians.\n\nThe motto of the Board of Student Librarians is \"Esprit de Corps\", which means \"the spirit of togetherness\".\n\nSource: MBSSKL Library Heritage Corner\n\nMBSKL was founded by Rev. Dr. William T. Kensett, a naval officer of the Royal Navy battleship HMS \"Orion\". In July 1897 he decided to set up a church and school for the Tamils in Kuala Lumpur, and he left the British Navy. A shophouse was secured at the corner of Batu Road and Java Street, and the predominantly Tamil school was named the Anglo-Tamil School.\n\nIn 1904, the school moved to its current premises on Petaling Hill and was renamed the Methodist Boys' School Kuala Lumpur by Rev William E Horley, the name used until this day.\n\nIn 1954, the 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company was set up in the school by Mr. Khoo Oon Soo and Mr. R.A. Allen. After the first few years, 1st KL shifted to the Wesley Church just next door to the school, and used the Church premises as its meeting place. The 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company is the 3rd oldest company in Malaysia, and is known for its history in Band, Footdrill and Talent Time competition results at National Level. The Company has also produced a fine collection of President's Men and Founder's Men, as well as two Queen's Men.\n\nIn 1958, the school was divided into the Secondary School (MBSSKL) and the Primary School (MBPSKL) in accordance with Malaysia's new Education Policy.\n\nIn its natural geography, Petaling Hill, on which MBS now stands, the school overlooks one of the oldest business sections of Kuala Lumpur which consists of many of the oldest Chinese business establishments.\n\nThe reason for Rev Horley choosing this site for the Wesley Church, the parsonage and the school was not different from other pioneer missionaries who chose sites for church, school and living quarters in other parts of the country. It was to be close to the community whom they wanted to serve, but yet sufficiently removed to have the quiet serenity for school and church to function and the incumbent pastor who used to also head the school, to dwell in peace.\n\nIt is not surprising that as the country developed and as towns became cities, churches and schools which were once at the fringes of towns, are now engulfed in the midst of city centres.\n\nNumbered among the former students are successful citizens in all walks of life and professions. There is no record of the progress and achievements of students who have left the school.\n\nThe school's traditional rivals are the Victoria Institution and St. John's Institution, as the two institutions together with MBSKL are generally known as the top three boys' schools in Kuala Lumpur. This friendly rivalry existed way back in the three schools' history of over 100 years, not only on the sports field but also in academic and extracurricular pursuits.\n\nThe MBSSKL bell is the oldest existing school bell in Kuala Lumpur and dates from 1923. It was mounted in a special tower built by MBSOBA and was located at the Reading Corner. The tower was demolished along with the Youth Center on 28 June 2010. However, the bell tower was restored and rebuilt in its old spot in 2014.\n\nSource: MBSKL Centenary Commemorative Book\n\nThe traditional uniform for the students is white long pants and a white shirt, with a plain dark blue tie. However, the school has changed its uniform in line with Government policy which requires all secondary students to wear Olive Green pants and a white shirt. MBSSKL does not allow the wearing of pants with pleats and/or bell-bottoms. The school tie is navy blue in colour, with repeated patterns of the school crest. A metal school badge is worn over the left pocket, and a cloth name tag sewn on under the school badge. Students from different year groups would have different coloured name tags. Nevertheless, temporary name tags are available for sale during morning assemblies and recess time. (Until 2004, the name tags were made of plastic, coloured based on forms with black wordings for students.)\n\nMembers of the all the student boards wear different uniforms and metal badges except those in the Editorial Board.\n\nThere are eight major boards in the school, namely the Prefectorial Board, Board of Student Librarians, Editorial Board, IT Brigade, the Sportsmen's Board, SPBT Prefects Board, Board of Student Cooperation, and Board of Class Monitors. \n\nThe Prefectorial Board was founded in 1931. The head of prefects in MBSSKL are known as School Captains (Kapten Sekolah) and not Head Prefects (Ketua Pengawas). In the event that a former School Captain should return to study in the school for the Lower and Upper Six form, he would immediately assume the post of Honorary School Captain and be part of the Executive Committee until the incumbent Executive Committee retires. Former Senior Prefects returning to study in the school for the Lower and Upper Six form are considered assets to the Board and are immediately reinstated. In any one academic year, a Vice Captain 2 may be elected in the Annual General Meeting if the position is deemed necessary. However, the position is reserved for a Form 6 Senior Prefect only.\n\nInterviews for appointments as prefects are extended only to selected students after exhaustive vetting. Appointments to students of the Lower Sixth Form are reserved for girls. The interviewing panel consist of the members of the Executive Committee, although pro tem EXCOs may take up this responsibility if the interviews fall after 31 July. Successful interviewees would undergo a period of probation where the duration is determined by the Executive Committee of the Board and the Advisor(s).\n\nInauguration of the in-coming elected Executive Committee and the installation of new Senior Prefects are held annually in a ceremony on Prefects' Day. Upon installation, the new Senior Prefects will wear a Prefect's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a blue banner beneath bearing the word \"Prefect\" in white lettering. A Prefect's name tag is yellow with navy blue lettering, and is worn immediately below the Prefect's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the Prefectorial Board are the only students in the school warranted to wear special school badges that bear their respective portfolio titles in white lettering on a blue banner beneath the school crest (e.g. Secretary), unlike the Executive Committee members of other boards where a separate tag is worn beneath their Board badges (i.e. The Librarian Chairman wears a tag stating his position - \"Chairman of Centenary Library\" below his Librarian's Badge and above his white name tag.).\n\nAside from maintaining student discipline, the Prefects are organisers of the annual Teachers' Day and are given near-total autonomy for all the activities in the event.\n\nThe Board of Student Librarians proper was founded in 1962 although students who were voluntary helpers were formally given the title \"Student Librarians\" in 1957. In 1962, the current uniform of the librarians was designed by former teacher advisor Mrs. Sally Ti. The Librarians wear a Librarian's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a yellow banner beneath bearing the word \"Librarian\" . A Librarian's name tag is white with dark blue lettering, and is worn immediately below the Librarian's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the Board of Student Librarians retains their Board Badge and wears a separate tag bearing their respective portfolio titles.\n\nThe Sportsmen's Club (Now Sportsmen's Board) was founded in the early 1970s. Membership to this board is extremely exclusive to those who excel in sports and character. Annually, less than 5 students are awarded membership to the Sportsmen's Board. The Sportsmen wear a Sportman's Badge, which is a silver pentadecagon with 120 decorative straight lines (8 lines between each vertices) projecting outwards engraved on the edge with the standard school crest in the centre encircled by a blue ring that bear the words \"Lembaga Olahragawan Kuala Lumpur\".\n\nThe IT Brigade was established in 2006 to develop the IT infrastructure in the school compound. Their duties include all computer-related issues of the school especially maintaining the Multimedia labs for the students' usage and computer repairs. The IT Brigadiers wear an IT Brigadier's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a black banner beneath bearing the word \"IT Brigade\". An IT Brigadier's name tag is silver with black lettering, finished with a clear protective layer, and is worn immediately below the IT Brigadier's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the IT Brigade retains their Board Badge and wears a separate tag bearing their respective portfolio titles.\n\nThe Board of Student SPBT Prefects was established in 2012 to coordinate the loaning, returning and preservation of textbooks under the textbook loaning programme introduced by the Malaysian Ministry of Education. Apart from the annual loaning and returning of textbooks at the end of every academic year, they are responsible for making sure the textbooks are treated with care and respect throughout the loan period. The BOSS Prefects are trained to wrap books neatly (i.e. wrapping the covers tightly with minimal excess plastic wrapping) and cataloguing textbooks. The BOSS Prefects wear a BOSS Prefect's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a red banner beneath bearing the word \"BOSS\".\n\nThe Editorial Board was established in 1906. Members of this Board do not wear special uniforms and may consist of students of any age. Membership from students in existing Boards are allowed as long as their prior responsibilities do not impede the progress of the magazine production. The Excelsior's Editor-in-Chief is assisted by his sub-editors and six other departments, namely Highlights, Organisation, Miscellaneous, Graphics, Photography, and Profiles. Every member is selected based on their strengths (e.g. writing, photography, etc.) and ability to work in a team. The teacher advisor and the team are given privileged access to all events related to the school so as to be able to capture important moments in photos and words for the Excelsior. The Board's duties regardless of whichever department is labour-intensive and requires precision in their works to be able to meet tight deadlines with external printers, photographers and binders.\n\nThe Board of Student Cooperation was established in 2017 to help in managing mainly students locker and promoting school supplies such as school tie and badges. The uniform of this Board is black slacks with white colour sleeve shirts together with a badge. \n\nThe Board of Class Monitors was established to primarily assist teachers with daily tasks such as taking attendance and maintaining the order in class. Members of this Board do not wear special uniforms but a small tag written with \"Ketua Tingkatan\" and \"Penolong Ketua Tingkatan\" was given to the members and are required to wear with school uniforms at all times. The Board will have meetings every first week of the month to discuss about problems faced in class, rules and regulations in class and the cleanliness of each class.\n\nMBSSKL operates a merit/demerit points scheme for rewards and punishments. The computer server and system is maintained and coordinated by the Prefectorial Board with guidance from the Senior Assistant of Student Affairs and discipline teachers. Accumulated demerit points may be worked off by carrying out tasks such as cleaning the assembly terraces, field and walkways. Corporal punishment is administered for a wide range of school offences, consisting of either one, two or three strokes of the cane.\n\nLike other former British schools, MBS practises the house system, although nowadays the house system is mainly for sports purposes. Four of the houses are named after donors who provided the establishment funds of the school, and one is named after a prominent former principal. 3 new houses were introduced in 2009. The houses are:\n\nThe CBD is an annual event organised by the student boards, namely the Prefectorial Board, Board of Student Librarians, Sportsmen's Board since 1991. IT Brigade joined in as the 4th Board in 2007 and SPBT Board joined in as the 5th Board in 2012. Traditionally, the main focus of this event was the installation of the members of the above boards, but over the years, the function has evolved to no longer include installation. It is now a day of fun, socialising and fellowship with student leaders from KL and Selangor schools, and is always organised in a way that brings positive outcomes to the boards as well as the school. It can also be a day of conference where Kuala Lumpur and Selangor school leaders meet up together and discuss about issues arising among students as well as to solve the problems. Like most events organised in MBSSKL, students are given near-total autonomy on selecting the theme and planning the events of the day. The 29th Combined Boards' Day was held in 2019.\n\nThere are 7 uniformed bodies in the school as of 2009. Some examples are:\n\n10th Kuala Lumpur Air Scouts was established in 1915 and absorbed 15th Kuala Lumpur Scouts Troop after the second World War.\n\nFounded by Mr. Khoo Onn Soo under the sponsorship of Wesley Methodist Church, Kuala Lumpur in 1954. 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys Brigade was the first of the companies to be established in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nKLN6ACD is a division under St. John Ambulance of Malaysia, part of an international voluntary service organisation dedicated to training and providing first aid skills. The division has had numerous achievements in competitions at the state and national levels, and continues to be a major contributor in voluntary first aid service within the school as well as the public through duties coordinated by the State Officers.\n\nPrincipal : Brendan Ravi Chandran A/L Krishnan \n\nSenior Assistant 1(Administration and Curriculum) : Phua Siew Ching\nSenior Assistant (Student Affairs) : Yusni Bin Yusof\nSenior Assistant (Co-curriculum) : Mohd Hasbi Bin Ramli\nSenior Assistant (Higher Learning) : Gan Swit Peng\nSenior Assistant (Special Education): Loi Wing Ping\n\nSenior of Languages : Rozana Binti Hashim\nSenior of Humanitarian And Social Sciences : Flora Grace David\nSenior of Science And Mathematics : Fazliyanee Binti Pakhuruddin\nSenior of Technical And Vocational : Norizan Bt.

His father is relatively content to stay, while his mother copes by trying to cobble together atomic era cocktails. When Adam has to come out of the shelter to get more supplies, his old-fashioned attitudes and manners make him a hit with everyone he meets, and attracts the attentions of Eve Rustikoff.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment.\n\nIn 1962, eccentric American scientist Dr. Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) believes nuclear war with the Soviet Union is imminent, and builds a secret fallout shelter beneath his backyard. Alarmed by the Cuban Missile Crisis, Calvin takes his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) into the shelter. Due to a freak mechanical failure causing the pilot of a passing F-86 Sabre fighter jet to lose control and eject, the abandoned plane crashes into the house; Calvin assumes the worst and activates the shelter’s time-locks for 35 years. With the house completely destroyed by the crash, the Webbers' neighbors and authorities assume they were killed and their property is left abandoned.\n\nHelen gives birth to Adam, who is immersed in culture up to 1962, including TV reruns of \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Honeymooners\" and listening to pop standards by Perry Como and Dean Martin. A diner is built above the shelter which opens in 1965, where Melcher (Joey Slotnick) works for Mom (Dale Raoul) as a soda jerk. The diner becomes a pizzeria, then a punk club named Purgatory as the suburban neighborhood deteriorates throughout the decades into an inner city ghetto. Mom eventually gives the club to Melcher; the establishment closes and by 1995, he is an alcoholic living in its condemned remains.\n\nWhen the shelter unlocks in 1997, Calvin mistakes the now-blighted neighborhood where his home once was for a post-apocalyptic wasteland of irradiated mutants and decides the family must stay underground. With supplies running out and Calvin falling ill, Adam (Brendan Fraser) leaves the shelter for the first time. He meets Melcher, who encountered Calvin the previous night, bursting through the floor in his radiation suit. Melcher now worships Calvin and the elevator. Marveling at the outside world, Adam purchases supplies, but cannot remember his way back to the pub.\n\nTrying to sell his father's classic baseball cards at a hobby shop, Adam meets Eve Rustikoff (Alicia Silverstone). She stops the store owner (Bill Gratton) from cheating Adam and is fired. Eve drives Adam to a Holiday Inn in exchange for a rare card, but returns the next morning out of guilt. Adam asks her to help purchase supplies. Unaware of the value of money, Adam agrees to her request for $1,000 a week. He also asks Eve to help him find a wife from Pasadena, California, per his mother's advice, who is \"not a mutant\". Adam meets Eve's gay housemate and best friend Troy (Dave Foley), who provides him with advice and a fashion makeover.\nEve and Troy take Adam to a 1940s swing-style nightclub to find him a wife. Adam attracts the attention of several women, including Eve's nemesis Sophie (Carmen Moré). Jealous, Eve reconnects with her ex-boyfriend Cliff (Nathan Fillion), who goads Adam into an altercation, relenting when Adam demonstrates his boxing skills, having trained every day with his father. Eve leaves. Troy returns home and explains Adam went home with Sophie. Adam returns, explaining that he politely rejected Sophie's advances, as he could only think about Eve. He and Eve kiss, but when Adam admits the truth about his past and his desire to take her to be his wife \"underground\", she asks him to leave.\n\nFinding the pub, where Melcher preaches to a full congregation, Adam returns to Eve's house, where she is waiting with Dr. Nina Aron (Jenifer Lewis) and her assistant to have him committed. Initially cooperating, Adam escapes asking Eve and Troy to collect his things and pay his hotel bill. In his hotel room, Troy and Eve find toiletries and clothing from the 1960s and absurdly valuable stock certificates in companies like IBM (which Calvin had written off as \"worthless\"), and realize that Adam was telling the truth the whole time.\n\nAs Melcher and his cult load supplies into the shelter, Calvin prepares to seal his family inside again. Eve spots Adam outside the pub; they embrace, and Adam takes her to meet his parents. Impressed with Eve, Calvin and Helen agree to set the shelter's locks for two months while Adam and Eve make arrangements.\n\nDuring this time, Adam and Eve sell the stocks to build his parents a new home in the country, identical to their house that was destroyed, including a restored red 1960 Cadillac convertible. They help Melcher rebuild the pub into a '50s-themed nightclub after convincing him that Adam is not God.\n\nAdam reveals there was never an atomic war, the \"bomb\" was not a bomb and instead was a plane that had crashed into their house, and the Soviet Union collapsed. Unconvinced, Calvin plans to build a new fallout shelter as Eve watches while playing with her engagement ring.\n\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall score of 57% of the comments positive based on 80 reviews, with the consensus: \"Cute idea, but not consistently funny\". On Metacritic has a score of 48%. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars saying \"the movie is funny and entertaining in all the usual ways, yes, but I was grateful that it tried for more: that it was actually about something, that it had an original premise, that it used satire and irony and had sly undercurrents.\"\n\n\"Blast from the Past\" opened in North American theaters on February 12, 1999 and took in $7,771,066 earning it 5th place at the box office for the weekend. It ultimately made a profit, grossing $40.3 million worldwide against its $35 million budget despite only grossing $26.5 million within the United States.\n\n\n"}

The film centers on the trials of a poor villager (Kapoor) who comes to a city in search of a better life. However, the naive man soon becomes trapped in a web of middle-class greed and corruption. The film also features a cameo by Nargis in the final scene.\n\nIt was produced in Bengali as Ek Din Raatre, starring Raj Kapoor, Chhabi Biswas, Pahari Sanyal, Nargis Dutt and Daisy Irani. The film won the Crystal Globe Grand Prix at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1957.\n\nA poor peasant (Kapoor) from the village, who comes to the city in search of work, is looking for some water to quench his thirst. He enters an apartment complex, whose residents take him for a thief and chase him. He runs from one flat to the other trying to escape his predicament. Along the way, he witnesses many shady undertakings in the flats where he hides. Ironically, these crimes are being committed by the so-called \"respectable\" citizens of the city, who by day, lead a life totally in contrast to their nighttime deeds behind closed doors.\n\nHe is shocked by these events and tries to escape by evading the search parties that are patrolling the apartment building in search of the elusive thief. He is unfortunately seen, and people chase him to the roof of the building. He puts up a brave resistance and then descends by the water pipes onto the porch of a flat. He goes in to find a young girl (Daisy Irani). She talks to him and kindles a self-belief in the peasant, who determinedly tries to face the adversity waiting outside. But when he ventures out of the flat, he is surprised to find that nobody takes notice of him. He eventually leaves the apartment building, his thirst still unquenched. He hears a beautiful song and searching for its source arrives at the doorstep of a woman (Nargis) drawing water from a well. His thirst is finally assuaged.\n\nOther than the acting, the music is the highlight of the film. Lyrics are by Shailendra and Prem Dhawan and music is by Salil Choudhary.\n\nThe songs are\n\n1. \"Zindagi Khawab Hai, Khvaab Me Jhuth Kya Aur Bhala Sach Hai Kya\" - Mukesh\n\n2. \"Main Koi Jhoot Boleya\" sung by Mohammed Rafi and S. Balbir and\n\n3. \"Jaago Mohan Pyaare\" - Lata Mangeshkar\n\n4. \"Thandee Thandee Savan Kee Phuhar\" - Asha Bhosle\n\n5. \"Maine Jo Li Angdayi\" - Haridhan, Sandhya Mukherjee\n\nThe song \"Zindagi Khwab Hai\", picturized on Motilal in Hindi was recorded as \"Ei Duniaye Shobi Hoi\" in the Bengali version and was picturized on Chhabi Biswas. Most of the storyline is identical between the two versions, as were the songs; \"Teki Main Jhuth Boliya\", sung by Mohammed Rafi and picturized on Sikh drivers is consistent in both versions. \"Jago Mohan Pritam\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar is common to both versions - only the lyrics were changed to Hindi and Bengali, as applicable.\n\n\n\"Jagte Raho\" was an overseas blockbuster at the Soviet box office, drawing 33.6 million Soviet viewers in 1965, due to Raj Kapoor's popularity in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the film earned an estimated 8.4 million SUR (US$9.33 million or 4.44 crore) in 1965, equivalent to US$ million (477 crore) in 2016.\n\nA shortened version of the film won the Crystal Globe Grand Prix at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1957. At the fourth annual National Film Awards, the film won the Certificate of Merit.\n\n"}

In addition to windsurfing competitions surfing contests are held there as well.\n\nThe name Ho‘okipa means \"hospitality\" in Hawaiian. Ho'okipa Beach Park is located on Maui's North Shore alongside the Hana Highway. There are picnic facilities and observation decks for visitors.\n\nThere are four distinct surf breaks at Ho'okipa. Pavilions is the break furthest east, off the lookout parking. West from it, facing the main parking, is Middles break. Pavilions is a right and middles is a left. The area between the two, which catches fewer breaking sets, is sometimes referred to as Girlie Bowl or Green Trees. Next further west, facing the lifeguard tower and the narrow sand beach launch, is H‘Poko or Point. It is the most popular break for windsurfing, and generally breaks as a right. With the prevailing trade wind direction being east to east-north-east, these are most frequently starboard tack down-the-line conditions (wind from right when standing on the beach). Yet further west, past the rocky point, is Lanes, which generally breaks as a left. Under relatively rare conditions, known as Kona, the prevailing winds become southwest, creating port tack down-the-line conditions at Lanes (wind from left when standing on the beach). This only occurs a few days out of every year.\n\nOver the years Ho'okipa has been the site for organized windsurfing competitions in the Wave discipline. A long-running annual event is the Aloha Classic, a Pro-Am competition with age categories for contestants. The Red Bull King of the Air international kitesurfing competition was held at Ho'okipa from 1999-2005.\n\nLike many locations on the Maui and Oahu North Shore, Ho'okipa Beach is occasionally a tourist attraction in the winter time because of spectacularly large surf. In the afternoon on 15 December 2004, for example, tourists visited the beach to see waves as large as 30 feet pound the shore; officials warned visitors to stay away from the water, as the surf was very deadly. Despite this, Ho'okipa is not an ideal site for true big-wave riding, as the waves close out when their faces approach about 25 feet. During such episodes, other deep-water breaks offer more rideable waves (an example of which is Jaws, offshore Peahi, Maui, which is a very short car ride from Hookipa.)\n\n"}

The station is currently owned by KSBN Radio, Inc., consisting of the gun rights group Second Amendment Foundation and its affiliate Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. The station broadcasts at 1230 kHz with a power of 1,000 watts day and night, from a transmitter tower located on top of the Delaney Building in Downtown Spokane.\n\nKSBN was first licensed in 1923 as KFIO, to North Central High School in Spokane. However, by this time, the school had been operating a radio transmitter for two years. In the summer of 1921 physics teacher Arthur L. Smith had seen the need to train young students in radio, an infant technology that would soon be widely used commercially. He obtained a \"Technical and Training School\" station license, with the call sign \"7YL\", that was issued in the name of North Central High School. With this license students could learn telegraphy and radio theory, and then apply what they learned in real life. \n\nEffective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted regulations formally establishing standards for stations making broadcasts intended for the general public. On May 22, 1923, the high school was issued a broadcast station license, with the alphabetically assigned call letters of KFIO. This was one of the earliest non-commercial educational stations, and one of the few operated by a high school instead of a college. \n\nKFIO was operated by student members of high school's Radio Club. The station broadcast features such as school news, entertainment that included concerts by the school band and orchestra (live from the auditorium) and sports events, in particular games between North Central High and Lewis and Clark High in 1924 and 1925. In addition to Friday evening programs, the station also broadcast during school time Monday to Friday and occasionally on Sunday evenings. Despite some difficulty in and controversy over keeping the station on the air, many of the people who became radio broadcast professionals in Spokane and nearby communities in the early radio days got their start in radio at KFIO.\n\nD. Windsor Hunt, who worked at the station as a student beginning in 1927, related his experiences at the station and talked about what kind of programming the station broadcast. He noted that, among other things, he was responsible for reading the news, playing records, announcing school athletic events, and proms. The station had a library of records, all 78 RPM, mostly from the 1910s, but they also were able to get a hold of more recent hits of the time. Hunt noted that they obtained a copy of the record \"Sweet Hearts on Parade\" when it was still number one on the hit parade. Hunt also related they would read the news verbatim from the \"Spokesman-Review\" and the \"Spokane Chronicle\", but they gave no credit to the original sources. They had to be careful to avoid mentioning divorce, sex, or bootlegging as those topics were considered taboo.\n\nHunt's account noted that the station's studio was originally located in crowded quarters on an upper floor in the south end of the high school building. He also stated that: \"... The [transmitter] was in a closet about 8' X 16', between the physics lab and classroom, on the south side of the 3rd floor. ... The transmitter took up about six square feet and a two-foot passage alongside led to the studio. This was the back of the room with one window to an airwell. It was about 8' X 12'. ... On the right side was the 'console' - a bench about two feet wide with one turntable mounted on it. Later we got a variable speed job, but we didn't have LP (long play, not liquid petroleum) records so we never used it in my time. ... Someone loaned Mr. A. L. Smith a mechanical song bird from Europe - a wind up dealy in a big brass cage. Every 15 minutes it sang a line in a very beautiful realistic bird song. On the hour it sang a longer trill. It not only warned us of the time but often added a nice touch to the announcements.\"\n\nKFIO was financed by the local school board, which eventually reduced its support to a level that no longer permitted the station to remain operating. Thus, on August 23, 1929, the station was sold to the Spokane Broadcasting Corporation and converted to a commercial operation.\n\nIn 1950, with the sale of the station to Louis Wasmer, the call letters were changed to KSPO. This was followed by a series of ownership and call letter changes. TCC Broadcasting established an \"all business\" format in 1990, after the station went off the air for a short time. On April 29, 1991, it became KSBN.\n\nOwner/Manager Tom Cock sold the station in 1995 to KSBN Radio, Inc.\n\n"}

In 1938, he was assassinated by the staff of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics in Shanghai.\n\nTang was a native of Xiangshan County, Guangdong. Tang was educated in the United States, attending elementary school in Springfield, Massachusetts, and high school in Hartford, Connecticut. He later studied at Queen's College, Hong Kong, and then Columbia University in New York on the Chinese Educational Mission.\n\nTang was a friend of Yuan Shikai; and during the Xinhai Revolution, negotiated on the latter's behalf in Shanghai with the revolutionaries' Wu Tingfang, ending up with the recognition of Yuan as President of the Republic of China. He had been a diplomat with Yuan Shikai's staff in Korea. In 1900, he was appointed head of the Shandong Bureau of Foreign Affairs under governor Yuan Shikai.\n\nWidely respected, he became the Republic's first Prime Minister in 1912, but quickly grew disillusioned with Yuan's lack of respect for the rule of law and resigned. He later took part in Sun Yat-sen's government in Guangzhou. Tang Shaoyi opposed, on constitutional grounds, Sun's taking of the \"\"Extraordinary Presidency\"\" in 1921; Tang resigned from his position. In 1924, he refused an offer to be foreign minister under warlord Duan Qirui's provisional government in Beijing.\n\nIn 1937, Tang bought a house on Route Ferguson in the Shanghai French Concession and retired there. The following year, the Japanese invaded and occupied Shanghai (though not yet the foreign concessions). Japanese general Kenji Doihara attempted to recruit Tang to become president of the new pro-Japanese puppet government, and Tang was willing to negotiate with the Japanese. The Kuomintang's intelligence agency Juntong learned about the negotiation, and its chief Dai Li ordered his assassination. On 30 September 1938, Tang was killed in his living room by a Juntong squad who pretended to be antique sellers.\n\nTang Shaoyi's daughter Tang Baoyue (English name May Tang) was married to the prominent diplomat V.K. Wellington Koo. She died in October 1918 during the 1918 flu pandemic, after falling ill for only a week. Another daughter Lora Tang was married to the well-known Singapore philanthropist Lee Seng Gee, former chairman of the Lee Foundation.\nAnother daughter from his first wife, Isobel, was married to Henry K. Chang (Chang Chien), the Chinese Ambassador and Consul General at San Francisco (1929).\n"}

After the Greater Berlin Act the city became the third largest municipality in the world and experienced its heyday as a major world city. It was known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, film, higher education, government, diplomacy, industries and military affairs.\n\nThe Weimar Republic era began in the midst of several major movements in the fine arts. German Expressionism had begun before World War I and continued to have a strong influence throughout the 1920s, although artists were increasingly likely to position themselves in opposition to expressionist tendencies as the decade went on.\n\nA sophisticated, innovative culture developed in and around Berlin, including highly developed architecture and design (Bauhaus, 1919–33), a variety of literature (Döblin, \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", 1929), film (Lang, \"Metropolis\", 1927, Dietrich, \"Der blaue Engel\", 1930), painting (Grosz), and music (Brecht and Weill, \"The Threepenny Opera\", 1928), criticism (Benjamin), philosophy/psychology (Jung), and fashion. This culture was often considered to be decadent and socially disruptive by rightists.\n\nFilm was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called German Expressionism. \"Talkies\", the sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nThe so-called \"mystical arts\" also experienced a revival during this time-period in Berlin, with astrology, the occult, and esoteric religions and off-beat religious practices becoming more mainstream and acceptable to the masses as they entered popular culture.\n\nBerlin in the 1920s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play \"I Am a Camera\", which was later adapted into a musical, \"Cabaret\", and an Academy Award winning film of the same name. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel \"The Temple\" evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the time.\n\nThe University of Berlin (today \"Humboldt University of Berlin\") became a major intellectual centre in Germany, Europe, and the World. The sciences were especially favored — from 1914 to 1933.\n\nAlbert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. He served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, only leaving after the anti-Semitic Nazi Party rose to power.\n\nPhysician Magnus Hirschfeld established the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of homosexuality could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for homosexual, bisexual, and transgender legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum.\n\nPolitically, Berlin was seen as a left wing stronghold, with the Nazis calling it \"the reddest city [in Europe] after Moscow.\" Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels became his party's \"Gauleiter\" for Berlin in the autumn of 1926 and had only been in charge a week before organizing a march through a communist-sympathizing area that devolved into a street riot. The communists, who adopted the motto \"Beat the fascists wherever you encounter them!\" had their own paramilitary organization called the Roter Frontkämpferbund to battle the Nazis' Sturmabteilung (SA). In February 1927 the Nazis held a meeting in the \"Red\" stronghold of Wedding that turned into a violent brawl. \"Beer glasses, chairs and tables flew through the hall, and severely injured people were left lying covered with blood on the floor. Despite the injuries, it was a triumph for Goebbels, whose followers beat up about 200 communists and drove them from the hall.\"\n\nThe government began printing tremendous amounts of currency to pay reparations; this caused staggering inflation that destroyed middle-class savings. However, economic expansion resumed after mid-decade, aided by U.S. loans. It was then that culture blossomed especially.\n\nThe heyday of Berlin began in the mid-1920s when it was the most industrialized city of the continent. Tempelhof Airport was opened in 1923 and a start was made on S-Bahn electrification from 1924 onwards. Berlin was also the second biggest inland harbor of Germany; all of this infrastructure was needed to transport and feed the over 4 million Berliners throughout the 1920s.\n\nDuring the interwar period high-quality architecture was built on a large scale in Berlin for broad sections of the population, including poorer people. In particular the Berlin Modernism housing estates built before the beginning of National Socialism set standards worldwide and therefore have been added to the UNESCO World-heritage list in 2008.\n\nAs a result of the economically difficult situation during the Weimar Republic, housing construction, which up to that time had been mainly privately financed and profit-oriented, had found itself at a dead end. Inflation was on the up and for citizens on low incomes decent housing was becoming increasingly unaffordable.\n\nConsequently, the search was on to find new models for state-initiated housing construction, which could then be implemented with a passion from 1920 on following the creation of Greater Berlin and the accompanying reform of local and regional government. The requirements for the type of flats to be built and the facilities they were to have were clearly defined, and the city was divided into different building zones. Following some basic ideas of the Garden city movement two- to three-storey housing estates that were well integrated into the landscape of the suburbs of the city were planned. The first large estate of this type with more than 2,000 residential units was the so-called \"Hufeisensiedlung\" (Horseshoe Estate) designed by Bruno Taut in Berlin, which introduced a new type of high quality housing and became a prominent example for the use of colors in architecture.\n\nProstitution rose in Berlin and elsewhere in the areas of Europe left ravaged by World War I. This means of survival for desperate women, and sometimes men, became normalized to a degree in the 1920s. During the war, venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea spread at a rate that warranted government attention. Soldiers at the front contracted these diseases from prostitutes, so the German army responded by granting approval to certain brothels that were inspected by their own medical doctors, and soldiers were rationed coupon books for sexual services at these establishments. Homosexual behaviour was also documented among soldiers at the front. Soldiers returning to Berlin at the end of the War had a different attitude towards their own sexual behaviour than they had a few years previously. Prostitution was frowned on by respectable Berliners, but it continued to the point of becoming entrenched in the city's underground economy and culture. \n\nCrime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called \"Ringvereine\". The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially \"lust murders\" or \"Lustmord\". Publishers met this demand with inexpensive criminal novels called \"Krimi\", which like the film noir of the era (such as the classic \"M\"), explored methods of scientific detection and psychosexual analysis.\n\nApart from the new tolerance for behaviour that was technically still illegal, and viewed by a large part of society as immoral, there were other developments in Berlin culture that shocked many visitors to the city. Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of homosexual venues for men and for lesbians; sometimes transvestites of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a transvestite clientele. There were also several nudist venues. Berlin also had a museum of sexuality during the Weimar period, at Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of Sexology. These were nearly all closed when the Nazi regime became a dictatorship in 1933.\n\nArtists in Berlin became fused with the city's underground culture as the borders between cabaret and legitimate theatre blurred. Anita Berber, a dancer and actress, became notorious throughout the city and beyond for her erotic performances (as well as her cocaine addiction and erratic behaviour). She was painted by Otto Dix, and socialized in the same circles as Klaus Mann.\n\n1920s Berlin was a city of many social contrasts. While a large part of the population continued to struggle with high unemployment and deprivations in the aftermath of World War I, the upper class of society, and a growing middle class, gradually rediscovered prosperity and turned Berlin into a cosmopolitan city. \n\nCinema in Weimar culture did not shy away from controversial topics, but dealt with them explicitly. \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" (1929) directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst and starring Louise Brooks, deals with a young woman who is thrown out of her home after having an illegitimate child, and is then forced to become a prostitute to survive. This trend of dealing frankly with provocative material in cinema began immediately after the end of the War. In 1919, Richard Oswald directed and released two films, that met with press controversy and action from police vice investigators and government censors. \"Prostitution\" dealt with women forced into \"white slavery\", while \"Different from the Others\" dealt with a homosexual man's conflict between his sexuality and social expectations. By the end of the decade, similar material met with little, if any opposition when it was released in Berlin theatres. William Dieterle's \"Sex in Chains\" (1928), and Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\" (1929) deal with homosexuality among men and women, respectively, and were not censored. Homosexuality was also present more tangentially in other films from the period.\n\nThe following significant films about 1920s Berlin show the metropolis between 1920 and 1933:\n\n\n\"See also:\" List of films set in Berlin\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210733", "title": "Bhumika (film)", "text": "Bhumika (film)\n\nBhumika (English: Role) is a 1977 Indian film directed by Shyam Benegal. The film stars Smita Patil, Amol Palekar, Anant Nag, Naseeruddin Shah and Amrish Puri.\n\nThe film is broadly based on the Marathi-language memoirs, \"Sangtye Aika\" of the well-known Marathi stage and screen actress of the 1940s Hansa Wadkar, who led a flamboyant and unconventional life, and focuses on an individual's search for identity and self-fulfilment. Smita Patil gives a strong performance of transforming from a vivacious teenager to a wiser but deeply wounded middle-aged woman.\n\nThe film won two National Film Awards and Filmfare Best Movie Award. It was invited to Carthage Film Festival 1978, Chicago Film Festival, where it was awarded the Golden Plaque 1978, and in 1986 it was invited to Festival of Images, Algeria.\n\n\"Bhumika\" tells the life story of an actress, Usha (Smita Patil), who is the granddaughter of a famous female singer of the old tradition from the Devadasi community of Goa. Usha's mother (Sulabha Deshpande) is married to an abusive and alcoholic Brahmin. Following his early death, and over her mother's objections, Usha is taken to Bombay by family hanger-on Keshav Dalvi (Amol Palekar) to audition successfully as a singer in a Bombay studio: the first step in a process, watched approvingly by Usha's doting grandmother and with horror by her mother, that will eventually carry her to on-camera adolescent stardom, and to an ill-starred love marriage with Keshav. Usha's motives for stubbornly pursuing this relationship (culminating in a pre-marital pregnancy) with the unattractive and much older Keshav — who appears to have lusted after her since childhood — are not spelled out. Presumably, she feels indebted to him for his loyalty to her family (of which he frequently reminds her) and for her own worldly success; she is also a headstrong girl who clearly enjoys her acting career and is bent on challenging her uptight mother (who opposes the match because Keshav does not belong to their caste, just as she opposes cinema itself because of its presumed disreputability).\n\nOnce the two are wed, Usha is shocked to find Keshav continuing to act as her \"business manager\", (After effects) arranging starring roles for her opposite, heartthrob Rajan (Anant Nag), who is himself in (unrequited) love with her. Since Keshav's other business ventures are unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha's earnings – a fact that Keshav clearly resents. He thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper, as well as (in effect) a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risqué work despite her dislike of her co-star and her protests that she \"only wants to be a housewife\" now that their daughter has been born. Not surprisingly, the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned, particularly by Keshav's suspicion (fed by star-magazine gossip) that she is having an affair with Rajan. Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel, separated from her daughter and mother, the desperately unhappy actress eventually does instigate two unsatisfying liaisons: with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), with whom she plots a double-suicide (which he foils), and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale (Amrish Puri), who keeps her as a pampered mistress on his palatial estate. Here Usha briefly finds a kind of \"respectability\" as a de facto second wife, earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale's mother, son, and bedridden first wife — but (as she learns one day when she tries to take the boy to a nearby fair) at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom. Unable to abide by Kale's hypocritical domestic rules, she finds her only hope of escape in the intervention of the hated Keshav, who promptly brings her back to a Bombay festooned with billboards of her own face, and to the same drab hotel and lonely prospects. As Kale's bitter wife remarks to Usha as the latter prepares to leave, \"The beds change, the kitchens change. Men's masks change, but men don't change.\"\n\nThe movie does not clarify the reason why Usha likes, and then dislikes Rajan. The climax of the movie is gloomy, and the viewers are left on their own to seek its message.\n\nThe film was based on autobiography of the doyenne of Marathi theatre and cinema Hansa Wadkar during the 1940s and 50s. The biography was told to journalist Arun Sadhu, who used the title of the hit musical, \"Sangtye Aika\" (1959) or \" \"Listen, and I'll Tell.\"\n\nThe film was set in Maharashtra region. Benegal's previous films were based in Andhra region, and since he was unfamiliar with the region, he roped in screenwriter and playwright Girish Karnad to co-write the script. Another noted theatre director and playwright Satyadev Dubey wrote the dialogues. The story moves back and forth across flashbacks to the early life of Wadkar. Apart from the non-linear narrative, the film also employed the film within a film device.\n\nLead actress, a 22-year-old Smita Patil still new to the medium, found the role daunting initially, yet as the filming progress, playing the multi-layered character, she found not only her space the industry and went to win the Best Actress Award for her performance, and today it is considered one of the best performances of her career.\n\n\n"}

Born in Worcester, England, he played for three different teams, and mainly played as a third baseman. After his third season, in 1877 as a member of the Louisville Grays, he was suspended from baseball for the remainder of his life for his part in throwing games for money. He is also the first person born in England to play Major League Baseball.\n\nNichols got his start at third base for the Brooklyn Atlantics of the National Association. He batted only .153 in 32 games played that season. The following year, after the collapse of the Association, he played for the New York Mutuals of the new National League and didn't fare much better, hitting .179 in 57 games.\n\nIt was for the Louisville Grays in that he would gain infamy. It was determined that he was involved in throwing games for money along with teammates George Hall, Jim Devlin, and Bill Craver. As a personal friend of Hall, he was brought in to play third base at Hall's insistence to replace Bill Hauge when he had to take time off due to injury. At this point, Louisville was in first place, but soon after Nichols' arrival, the team began to lose games at an alarming rate. Club President Charles E. Chase started to become suspicious when Nichols was still playing even though he continued to make key errors when Hauge was well enough to return to his starting position. His suspicion was confirmed when he received a couple telegrams instructing him to watch his players. Chase confronted the players, and Hall and Devlin confessed. The matter was referred to National League president William Hulbert, and Nichols was formally banned from Major League Baseball on December 4, 1877.\n\nAfter his banishment, he spent most of his life in the Brooklyn, New York area, got married and raised a family. He worked at various jobs, including as a shipping clerk and inspector, and was very remorseful about his role in the scandal, making many unsuccessful attempts to earn reinstatement. He died in Richmond Hill, New York, at the age of 84. He was cremated and interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.\n"}
{"id": "2210751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210751", "title": "Sercquiais", "text": "Sercquiais\n\n' also known as Sarkese or Sark-French (') is the Norman dialect of the Channel Island of Sark (Bailiwick of Guernsey). In the island it is sometimes known, slightly disparagingly, as the \"patois\", a French term meaning \"regional language\".\n\nSarkese is in fact a descendant of the 16th century Jèrriais used by the original colonists, 40 families mostly from Saint Ouen, Jersey who settled the then uninhabited island, although influenced in the interim by Guernésiais (the dialect of Guernsey). It is still spoken by older inhabitants of the island. Although the lexis is heavily anglicised, the phonology retains features lost in Jèrriais since the 16th century. Most of the local placenames are in Sarkese. In former times, there may have been two subdialects of Sercquiais. It is also closely related to the Auregnais (Alderney) dialect, as well as Continental Norman.\n\nRelatively little Sercquiais has been transcribed, and as there is no widely accepted form, it has received a certain amount of stigma as a result. A ruler of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway, who was a speaker herself, claimed that it could \"never be written down\", and this myth has continued in the years since then.\n\nThe earliest published text in Sercquiais so far identified is the \"Parable of the Sower\" () from the Gospel of Matthew. Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, linguist, visited the Channel Islands in September 1862 in order to transcribe samples of the insular language varieties, which he subsequently published in 1863:\n\nWhich in the NIV is translated as:\n\nSercquiais does not have the voiced dental fricative which is such a distinctive characteristic of St. Ouen in Jersey where most of the colonists came from.\n\npalatalisation of velars and (see Joret line) is less fully developed in Sercquiais than in Jèrriais. Palatalisation in Jèrriais of to and to has the equivalent in Sercquiais of and . For example, \"hiccup\" is in Jèrriais and in Sercquiais; \"war\" is respectively and .\n\nPalatalisation of in Jèrriais leads to , but in Sercquiais is generally retained: \"profession, trade\" in Sercquiais is , whereas Jèrriais has palatalised to .\n\nFinal consonants of masculine nouns in the singular are in free variation with null in all positions except in liaison. Final consonants are usually pronounced at ends of phrases. Final consonants are always lost in plural forms of masculine nouns. A \"cat\" may therefore be or in Sercquiais, but \"cats\" are . For comparison, Jèrriais \"cat\" is usually pronounced , and the plural has the long vowel as in Sercquiais. It can also therefore be seen that length is phonemic and may denote plurality.\n\nSercquiais has also retained final consonants that have been entirely lost in Jèrriais, such as final in (\"meadow\" – in Jèrriais as in French).\n\nMetathesis of is uncommon in Sercquiais, and in Jèrriais, by comparison with Guernésiais.\n\nThe palatalised l, which in Jèrriais has been generally palatalised to in initial position and following a consonant, is maintained in Sercquiais.\n\nGemination occurs regularly in verb conjugations and gerunds, as in Jèrriais but in distinction to Guernésiais.\n\nHowever, Sercquiais does not geminate palatal fricatives, unlike Jèrriais:\n\nThe St. Ouennais origins of Sercquiais can be seen in the 2nd and 3rd person plural forms of the preterite. Sercquiais uses an ending \"-dr\" which is typical of the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais, but generally not used elsewhere in Jersey (nor nowadays by younger speakers in St. Ouen).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210754", "title": "Robert Charles Zaehner", "text": "Robert Charles Zaehner\n\nRobert Charles Zaehner (1913–1974) was a British academic whose field of study was Eastern religions. He understood the original language of many sacred texts, e.g., Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic. Earlier, starting in World War II, he had served as an intelligence officer in Iran. At Oxford University his first writings had been on the Zoroastrian religion and its texts. Appointed Spalding Professor, his books addressed such subjects as mystical experience (articulating a widely cited typology), Hinduism, comparative religion, Christianity and other religions, and ethics. He translated the Bhagavad-Gita, providing an extensive commentary based on Hindu tradition and sources. His last books addressed similar issues in popular culture, which led to his talks on the BBC. He published under the name R. C. Zaehner.\n\nBorn on 8 April 1913 in Sevenoaks, Kent, he was the son of Swiss–German immigrants to England. Zaehner \"was bilingual in French and English from early childhood. He remained an excellent linguist all his life.\" Educated at the nearby Tonbridge School, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied Greek and Latin, and also ancient Persian including Avestan, gaining first class honours in Oriental Languages. During 1936–37 he studied Pahlavi, another ancient Iranian language, with Sir Harold Bailey at Cambridge University. Thereafter Zaehner held Prof. Bailey in high esteem. He then began work on his book \"Zurvan, a Zoroastrian Dilemma\", a study of the pre-Islamic religion of Iran.\n\nZaehner enjoyed \"a prodigious gift for languages\". He later acquired a reading knowledge of Sanskrit (for Hindu scriptures), Pali (for Buddhist), and Arabic (for Islamic). In 1939 he taught as a research lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford. During this period, he read the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, and the Sufi poet of Iran Rumi, as well as studying the Hindu Upanishads. Zaehner came then to adopt a personal brand of \"nature mysticism\". Yet his spiritual progression led him a few years later to convert to Christianity, becoming a Roman Catholic while stationed in Iran.\n\nDuring World War II starting in 1943, he served as a British intelligence officer at their Embassy in Tehran. Often he was stationed in the field among the mountain tribes of northern Iran. After the war he also performed a more diplomatic role at the Tehran embassy. Decades later another British intelligence officer, Peter Wright, described his activities:\n\n\"I studied Zaehner's Personal File. He was responsible for MI6 counterintelligence in Persia during the war. It was difficult and dangerous work. The railway lines into Russia, carrying vital military supplies, were key targets for German sabotage. Zaehner was perfectly equipped for the job, speaking the local dialects fluently, and much of his time was spent undercover, operating in the murky and cutthroat world of countersabotage. By the end of the war his task was even more fraught. The Russians themselves were trying to gain control of the railway, and Zaehner had to work behind Russian lines, continuously at risk of betrayal and murder by pro-German or pro-Russian... .\"\n\nZaehner continued in Iran until 1947 as press attaché in the British Embassy, and as an MI6 officer. He then resumed his academic career at Oxford doing research on Zoroastrianism. During 1949, however, he was relocated to Malta where he trained anti-Communist Albanians. By 1950 he had secured an Oxford appointment as lecturer in Persian literature. Again in 1951–1952 he returned to Iran for government service. Prof. Nancy Lambton, who had run British propaganda in Iran during the war, recommended him for the Embassy position. Journalist Christopher de Bellaigue describes Robin Zaehner as \"a born networker who knew everyone who mattered in Tehran\" with a taste for gin and opium. \"When Kingsley Martin, the editor of the \"New Statesman\", asked Zaehner at a cocktail party in Tehran what book he might read to enlarge his understanding of Iran, Zaehner suggested \"Alice through the Looking Glass\".\"\n\nZaehner publicly held the rank of Counsellor in the British Embassy in Tehran. In fact, he continued as an MI6 officer. During the Abadan Crisis he was assigned to prolong the Shah's royal hold on the Sun Throne against the republican challenge led by Mohammed Mossadegh, then the Prime Minister. The crisis involved the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which had been in effect nationalised by Mossadegh. Zaehner thus became engaged in the failed 1951 British effort to topple the government of Iran and return oil production to that entity controlled by the British government. \"[T]he plot to overthrow Mossadegh and give the oilfields back to the AIOC was in the hands of a British diplomat called Robin Zaehner, later professor of Eastern religions at Oxford.\" Such Anglo and later American interference in Iran, which eventually reinstalled the Shah, has been widely criticized.\n\nIn the 1960s, MI5 counterintelligence officer Peter Wright questioned Zaehner about floating allegations that he had doubled as a spy for the Soviet Union, harming British intelligence operations in Iran and Albania during the period following World War II. Zaehner is described as \"a small, wiry-looking man, clothed in the distracted charm of erudition.\" In his 1987 book \"Spycatcher\" Wright wrote that Zaehner's humble demeanor and candid denial convinced him that the Oxford don had remained loyal to Britain. Wright notes that \"I felt like a heel\" for confronting Zaehner.\n\nAlthough in the intelligence service for the benefit of his Government, on later reflection Zaehner did not understand the utilitarian activities he performed as being altogether ennobling. In such \"Government service abroad\", he wrote, \"truth is seen as the last of the virtues and to lie comes to be a second nature. It was, then, with relief that I returned to academic life because, it seemed to me, if ever there was a profession concerned with a single-minded search for truth, it was the profession of the scholar.\" Prof. Jeffrey Kripal discusses \"Zaehner's extraordinary truth telling\" which may appear \"politically incorrect\". The \"too truthful professor\" might be seen as \"a redemptive or compensatory act\" for \"his earlier career in dissimulation and deception\" as a spy.\n\nZaehner worked at the University until his death on 24 November 1974 in Oxford. \"[A]t the age of sixty-one he fell down dead in the street on his way to Sunday evening Mass.\" The cause of death was a heart attack.\n\nBefore the war Zaehner had lectured at Oxford University. Returning to Christ Church several years after the war, he continued work on his \"Zurvan\" book, and lectured in Persian literature. His reputation then \"rested on articles on Zoroastrianism, mainly philological\" written before the war.\n\nIn 1952 Zaehner was elected Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics to succeed the celebrated professor Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who had resigned to become Vice-President (later President) of India. Zaehner had applied for this position. Radhakrishnan previously had been advancing a harmonizing viewpoint with regard to the study of comparative religions, and the academic Chair had a subtext of being \"founded to propagate a kind of universalism\". Zaehner's inaugural lecture was unconventional in content. He delivered a strong yet witty criticism of \"universalism\" in religion.\n\nIt drew controversy. Prof. Michael Dummett opines that what concerned Zaehner was \"to make it clear from the start of his tenure of the Chair that he was nobody else's man.\" Zaehner continued an interest in Zoroastrian studies, publishing his \"Zurvan\" book and two others on the subject during the 1950s.\n\nSince 1952, however, he had turned his primary attention further East. \"After my election to the Spalding Chair, I decided to devote myself mainly to the study of Indian religions in accordance with the founder's wishes.\" He served Oxford in this academic chair, while also a fellow at All Souls College, until his death in 1974, and never married.\n\nIn his influential 1957 book \"Mysticism Sacred and Profane\", Zaehner discussed this traditional, cross-cultural spiritual practice. Based on mystical writings, he offered an innovative typology that became widely discussed in academic journals. He also analyzed claims that mescalin use fit into this spiritual quest. His conclusion was near dismissive. Yet he revisited his harsh words on the naïveté of drug mysticism in his 1972 book \"Zen, Drug and Mysticism\". His warnings became somewhat qualified by some prudent suggestions. He carefully distinguished between drug-induced states and religious mysticism. Then the BBC began asking him to talk on the radio, where he acquired a following. He was invited abroad to lecture.\n\nHis delivery in Scotland of the Gifford Lectures led him to write perhaps his most magisterial book. Zaehner traveled twice to the University of St. Andrews during the years 1967 to 1969. The subject he choose concerned the convoluted and intertwined history of the different world religions during the long duration of their mutual co-existence. He described the interactions as both fiercely contested and relatively cross-cultivating, in contrast to other periods of a more sovereign isolation. The lectures were later published in 1970 \"just four years before his death\" by Oxford University as \"Concordant Discord. The interdependence of faiths\".\n\nAs professor Zaehner \"had a great facility for writing, and an enormous appetite for work. [He also] had a talent for friendship, a deep affection for a number of particular close friends and an appreciation of human personality, especially for anything bizarre or eccentric\". Nonetheless. \"he passed a great deal of his time alone, most of it in his study working.\"\n\nAn American professor described Zaehner in a different light: \"The small, birdlike Zaehner, whose rheumy, color-faded eyes darted about in a clay colored face, misted blue from the smoke of Gauloises cigarettes, could be fearsome indeed. He was a volatile figure, worthy of the best steel of his age.\"\n\nHis colleague in Iran, Prof. Ann K. S. Lambton of SOAS, recalled, \"He did not, perhaps, suffer fools gladly, but for the serious student he would take immense pains\". Prof. Zaehner was \"an entertaining companion\" with \"many wildly funny\" stories, \"a man of great originality, not to say eccentricity.\"\n\n\"Zaehner was a scholar who turned into something different, something more important than a scholar,\" according to Michael Dummett, a professor of philosophy at Oxford, who wanted to call him a \"penseur\" [French: a thinker]. With insight and learning (and his war-time experience) Zaehner shed light on key issues in contemporary spiritual life, writing abundantly. \"His talent lay in seeing what to ask, rather than in how to answer... .\"\n\nAbout Zaehner's writing style, Wilfred Cantwell Smith compared it to a merry-go-round, so that the reader is not sure he is \"actually going somewhere. A merry-go-round of such engaging colour, boisterous sound effects, and bouncing intellectual activity, however, is itself perhaps no mean achievement.\"\n\nIn theology he challenged the ecumenical trend that strove to somehow see a uniformity in all religions. He acted not out of an ill will, but from a conviction that any fruitful dialogue between religions must be based on a \"pursuit of truth\". If such profound dialogue rested on a false or a superficial \"harmony and friendship\" it would only foster hidden misunderstandings, Zaehner thought, which would ultimately result in a deepening mistrust.\n\nInitially Zaehner's reputation rested on his studies of Zoroastrianism, at first articles mostly on philology in academic journals. He labored for many years on a scholarly work, his \"Zurvan, a Zoroastrian dilemma\" (1955). This book provides an original discussions of an influential theological deviation from the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of ancient Persia's Achaemenid Empire, which was a stark, ethical dualism. Zurvanism was promoted by the Sasanian Empire (224–651) which arose later during Roman times. Until the Muslim conquest, Zurvanism in the Persian world became established and disestablished by turns.\n\nZurvan was an innovation analogous to Zoroastrian original doctrine. The prophet Zoroaster preached that the benevolent \"Ahura Mazda\" (the \"Wise Lord\"), as the creator God, fashioned both \"Spenta Mainyu\" (the Holy Spirit), and \"Angra Mainyu\" (the Aggressive Spirit) who chose to turn evil. These two created Spirits were called twins, one good, one evil. Over the centuries \"Ahura Mazda\" and his \"messenger\" the good \"Spenta Mainyu\" became conflated and identified; hence, the creator \"Ahura Mazda\" began to be seen as the twin of the evil \"Angra Mainyu\". It was in this guise that Zoroastrianism became the state religion in Achaemenid Persia. Without fully abandoning dualism, some started to consider \"Zurvan\" (Time) as the underlying cause of both the benevolent \"Ahura Mazda\" and the evil \"Angra Mainyu\". The picture is complicated by very different schools of Zurvanism, and contesting Zoroastrian sects. Also, \"Ahura Mazda\" was later known as \"Ohrmazd\", and \"Angra Mainyu\" became \"Ahriman\".\n\nZurvan could be described as divinized Time (Zaman). With Time as 'father' twins came into being: the ethical, bountiful \"Ohrmazd\", who was worshipped, and his satanic antagonist \"Ahriman\", against whom believers fought. As Infinite Time, Zurvan rose supreme \"above Ohrmazd and Ahriman\" and stood \"above good and evil\". This aggravated the traditional 'orthodox' Zoroastrians (the Mazdean ethical dualists). Zoroastrian cosmology understood that \"finite Time comes into existence out of Infinite Time\". During the 12,000 year period of finite Time (Zurvan being both kinds of Time), human history occurs, the fight against Ahriman starts, and the final victory of \"Ohrmazd\" is achieved. Yet throughout, orthodox Mazdeans insisted, it is Ohrmazd who remains supreme, not Zurvan. On the other hand, his adherents held that Zurvan was God of Time, Space, Wisdom, and Power, and the Lord of Death, of Order, and of Fate.\n\n\"The Teachings of the Magi\" (1956) was Zaehner's second of three book on Zoroastrianism. It presented the \"main tenets\" of the religion in the Sasanid era, during the reign of Shapur II, a 4th-century King. Its chief sources were Pahlavi books written a few centuries later by Zoroastrians. Each of its ten chapters contains Zaehner's descriptive commentaries, illustrated by his translations from historic texts. Chapter IV, \"The Necessity of Dualism\" is typical, half being the author's narrative and half extracts from a Pahlavi work, here the Shikand Gumani Vazar by Mardan Farrukh.\n\nIn his \"The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism\" (1961), Zaehner adopted a chronological dichotomy. He first explores origins, the founding of the religion by its prophet Zoroaster. He notes that the Gathas, the earliest texts in the Avesta, make it obvious that \"Zoroaster met with very stiff opposition from the civil and ecclesiastical authorities when once he had proclaimed his mission.\" \"His enemies... supported the ancient national religion.\" On moral and ecological grounds, Zoroaster favored the \"settled pastoral and agricultural community\" as against the \"predatory, marauding tribal societies\". His theological and ethical dualism advocated for \"the followers of Truth the life-conserving and life-enhancing forces\" and against the \"destructive forces\" of the Lie. For the dates of the prophet's life, Zaehner adopted the traditional 6th century BCE dates.\n\nZoroaster reformed the old polytheistic religion by making Ahura Mazdah [the Wise Lord] the Creator, the only God. An innovation by Zoroaster was the \"abstract notions\", namely, the Holy Spirit, and the Amesha Spentas (Good Mind, Truth, Devotion, Dominion, Wholeness, Immortality). Zaehner interpreted them not as new substitutes for the excluded old gods, \"but as part of the divine personality itself\" which may also serve \"as mediating functions between God and man\". The \"Amesha Spentas\" are \"aspects of God, but aspects in which man too can share.\" Angra Mainyu was the dualistic evil. Dating to before the final parting of ways of the Indo-Iranians, the Hindus had two classes of gods, the \"asuras\" (e.g., Varuna) and the \"devas\" (e.g., Indra). Later following the invasion of India the \"asuras\" sank to the rank of demon. \"Au contraire\", in Iran the \"ahuras\" were favored, while the \"daevas\" fell and opposed truth, spurred in part by Zoroaster's reform. In the old Iranian religion, an \"ahura\" [lord] was concerned with \"the right ordering of the cosmos\".\n\nIn Part II, Zaehner discussed the long decline of Zoroastrianism. There arose the teachings about \"Zurvan i Akanarak\" [Infinite Time]. The Sasanid state's ideological rationale was sourced in Zoroastrian cosmology and sense of virtue. The \"Amesha Spentas\" provided spiritual support for human activities according to an articulated mean (e.g., \"the just equipoise between excess and deficiency\", Zoroastrian \"law\", and \"wisdom or reason\"). As an ethical principle the \"mean\" followed the contours of the 'treaty' between Ohrmazd [Ahura Mazda] and Ahriman [Angra Mainyu], which governed their struggle in Finite Time. Other doctrines came into prominence, such as those about the future saviour Saoshyans (Zoroaster himself or his posthumous son). Then after the final triumph of the Good Religion the wise lord \"Orhmazd\" \"elevates the whole material creation into the spiritual order, and there the perfection that each created thing has as it issues from the hand of God is restored to it\" in the \"Frashkart\" or \"Making Excellent\".\n\nZaehner contributed other work regarding Zoroaster and the religion began in ancient Iran. The article \"Zoroastrianism\" was included in a double-columned book he edited, \"The Concise Encyclopedia of Living Faiths\", first published in 1959. Also were his several articles on the persistence in popular culture of the former national religion, \"Zoroastrian survivals in Iranian folklore\". Chapters, in whole or part, on Zoroastrianism appeared in a few of his other books: \"At Sundry Times\" (1958), aka \"The Comparison of Religions\" (1962); \"The Convergent Spirit\", aka \"Matter and Spirit\" (1963); and \"Concordant Discord\" (1970).\n\nIn addition to the two titles below, other works of Zaehner are comparative or have a significant comparative element. Among these are: \"Concordant Discord\" (1970), and \"Our Savage God\" (1974).\n\nIn the west the academic field of comparative religion at its origins inherited an 'enlightenment' ideal of an objective, value-neutral rationalism. Yet traditional Christian and Jewish writings provided much of the source material, as did classical literature, these being eventually joined by non-western religious texts, then empirical ethnological studies. The privileged 'enlightenment' orientation in practice fell short of being value-neutral, and itself became progressively contested. As to value-neutral, Zaehner situated himself roughly as follows:\n\"Any man with any convictions at all is liable to be influenced by them even when he tries to adopt an entirely objective approach; but let him recognize this from the outset and guard against it. If he does this, he will at least be less liable to deceive himself and others.\" \"Of the books I have written some are intended to be objective; others, quite frankly, are not.\" \"In all my writings on comparative religion my aim has been increasingly to show that there is a coherent pattern in religious history. For me the centre of coherence can only be Christ.\" Yet \"I have rejected as irrelevant to my theme almost everything that would find a natural place in a theological seminary, that is, Christian theology, modern theology in particular.\" \"For what, then, do I have sympathy, you may well ask. Quite simply, for the 'great religions' both of East and West, expressed... in those texts that each religion holds most sacred and in the impact that these have caused.\"\nAccordingly, for his primary orientation Zaehner chose from among the active participants: Christianity in its Catholic manifestation. Yet the academic Zaehner also employed a type of comparative analysis, e.g., often drawing on Zoroastrian or Hindu, or Jewish or Islamic views for contrast, for insight. Often he combined comparison with a default 'modernist' critique, which included psychology or cultural evolution. Zaehner's later works are informed by Vatican II (1962-1965) and tempered by Nostra aetate.\n\nIn his 1958 book \"At Sundry Times. An essay in the comparison of religions\", Zaehner came to grips with \"the problem of how a Christian should regard the non-Christian religions and how, if at all, he could correlate them into his own\" (p. 9 [Preface]). It includes an Introduction (1), followed by chapters on Hinduism (2), on Hinduism and Buddhism (3), on \"Prophets outside Israel\", i.e., Zoroastrianism and Islam (4), and it concludes with Appendix which compares and contrasts the \"Quran and Christ\". Perhaps the key chapter is \"Consummatum Est\" (5), which \"shows, or tries to show, how the main trend in [mystical] Hinduism and Buddhism on the one hand and of [the prophetic] Zoroastrianism on the other meet and complete each other in the Christian revelation\" (Preface, p. 9, words in brackets added).\nThe book opens with a lucid statement of his own contested hermeneutic: \"with comparative religion,\" he says, \"the question is who's to be master, that's all\" (p. 9). He starts by saluting E. O. James. Next Zaehner mentions Rudolph Otto (1869-1937) and al-Ghazali (1058-1111) as both being skeptics about any 'reasonable' writer with no religious experience who expounds on the subject. Here Zaehner acknowledges that many Christians may only be familiar with their own type of religion (similar to Judaism and Islam), and hence be ill-equipped to adequately comprehend Hindu or Buddhist mysticism (pp. 12–15).\n\nZaehner then compared the Old Testament and the Buddha, the former being a history of God's commandments delivered by his prophets to the Jewish people and their struggle to live accordingly, and the later being a teacher of a path derived from his own experience, which leads to a spiritual enlightenment without God and apart from historical events (pp. 15–19, 24-26). Needed is a way to bridge this gap between these two (pp. 15, 19, 26, 28). The gap is further illustrated as it relates to desire and suffering (p. 21), body and soul (pp. 22–23), personality and death (pp. 23–24). He announced a 'method' special to the book: \"I shall concern myself with what sincere men have believed\" (p. 29).\n\nThe 1964 book, following its introduction, has four parts: India, China and Japan, Islam, and The Catholic Church. Throughout Zaehner offers connections between the self-understanding of 'other religions' and that of the Judeo-Christian, e.g., the Upanishads and Thomas Merton (pp. 25–26), Taoism and Adam (p. 68), Sunyata and Plato (p. 96), Al-Ghazali and St. Paul (p. 119-120), Samkhya and Martin Buber (pp. 131–132).\n\nIn the introduction, Zaehner laments the \"very checkered history\" of the Church. Yet he expresses his admiration of Pope John (1881-1963), who advanced the dignity that all humanity possesses \"in the sight of God\". Zaehner then presents a brief history of Christianity in world context. The Church \"rejoiced to build into herself whatever in Paganism she found compatible\" with the revelation and ministry of Jesus. Her confidence was inferred in the words of Gamaliel (pp. 7–9). While Europe has known of Jesus for twenty centuries, 'further' Asia has only for three. Jesus, however, seemed to have arrived there with conquerors from across the sea, and \"not as the suffering servant\" (p. 9). As to the ancient traditions of Asia, Christians did \"condemn outright what [they had] not first learnt to understand\" (pp. 11, 13). Zaehner thus sets the stage for a modern review of ancient traditions.\n\n\"The Catholic Church\" chapter starts by celebrating its inclusiveness. Zaehner quotes Cardinal Newman praising the early Church's absorption of classical Mediterranean virtues (a source some term 'heathen'). For \"from the beginning the Moral Governor of the world has scattered the seeds of truth far and wide... .\" There may be some danger for Christians to study the spiritual truths of other religions, but it is found in scripture.\n\nZaehner counsels that the reader not \"neglect the witness\" of Hinduism and Buddhism, as they teach inner truths which, among Christians, have withered and faded since the one-sided Reformation. The Church perpetually struggles to keep to a \"perfect yet precarious balance between the transcendent... Judge and King and the indwelling Christ\". Writing in 1964, Zaehner perceived \"a change for the better\" in the increasing acceptance of the \"Yogin in India or Zen in Japan\". Nonetheless, a danger exists for the 'unwary soul' who in exploring other religions may pass beyond the fear of God. Then one may enter the subtleties of mystical experience, and \"mistake his own soul for God.\" Such an error in distinguishing between \"timeless states\" can lead to ego inflation, spiritual vanity, and barrenness.\n\nZaehner offers this categorical analysis of some major religious affiliations: a) action-oriented, worldly (Judaism, Islam, Protestantism, Confucianism); b) contemplation-oriented, other-worldly (Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism, Taoism); c) in-between (Mahayana Buddhism, neo-Confucianism, the reformed Hinduism of Gandhi, the Catholic Church).\n\nMysticism as an academic field of study is relatively recent, emerging from earlier works with a religious and literary accent. From reading the writings of mystics, various traditional distinctions have been further elaborated, such as its psychological nature and its social-cultural context. Discussions have also articulated its phenomenology as a personal experience versus how it has been interpreted by the mystic or by others. Professor Zaehner made his contributions, e.g., to its comparative analysis and its typology.\n\nAfter Zaehner's initial works on Zoroastrianism, \"Mysticism. Sacred and Profane\" (1957) was his first published on another subject. It followed his assumption of the Spalding chair at All Souls College, Oxford. The book's conversational style delivers clarity and wisdom on a difficult subject, and along the way are found many illuminating digressions and asides.\n\nThe profane side is first addressed with regard to the use of mescaline. Zaehner himself carefully took this natural psychedelic drug. He discussed in particular Aldous Huxley, especially in his popular 1954 book \"The Doors of Perception\" (pp. 1–29, 208-226). Next, the subject of nature mystics is described and appraised, including two examples from literature: Proust and Rimbaud (pp. 30–83). 'Madness', it is also pointed out, may sometimes result in mental states that accord with those of the mystics (p. 84-105).\n\nA chapter \"Integration and isolation\" takes a comparative view, discussing mystics of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as Jung's psychology. Integration is described as nature mysticism joined to the intellect, whereby reason and the unconscious nourish one another (p. 114). Isolation refers to Samkhya mysticism, whereby the \"purusa\" (the soul) and \"prakrti\" (nature) are separated (p. 106-128). About the Hindu mystics, Zaehner contrasts Samkhya, a dualist doctrine associated with the Yoga method, and non-dualist Vedanta, a monism inspired by the \"Upanishads\". The relative merits of Monism verses Theism, and vice versa, are discussed (pp. 153–197). Near the end of his conclusion, Zaehner repeats his view that the monist and the theistic are \"distinct and mutually opposed types of mysticism\" (p. 204).\n\nHis innovative 1960 book compares the mystical literature and practice of Hindus and Muslims. He frames it with a theme of diversity. On experiential foundations, Zaehner then commences to explore the spiritual treasures left to us by the mystics of the Santana Dharma, and of the Sufi tariqas. Often he offers a phenomenological description of the reported experiences, after which he interprets them in various theological terms.\n\nFollowing Surendranath N. Dasgupta, Zaehner describes five different types of mysticism to be found in Indian tradition: \"the sacrificial, the Upanishadic, the Yogic, the Buddhistic, and that of \"bhakti\".\" Zaehner here has chosen to rely on Hindu mystics because of their relative freedom from creed or dogma. He leaves aside the first (of historic interest), and the fourth (due to contending definitions of nirvana), so that as exemplars of mystical experience he presents:\n\n\nBased on the above schematic, the resulting study of the mystics of the two religions must necessarily be asymmetrical. The sufis of Islam are approached from a Hindu perspective; indeed, many of the Muslim mystics are from the subcontinent of India. Yet the study provides thoughtful appraisls and insights.\n\nIn his work on comparative religion, Zaehner directly addressed mysticism, particularly in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. He criticized the then widely-held view that in mystical experience was to be found the key to the unity of all religions. He based his contrary views on well-known texts authored by the mystics of various traditions. Zaehner, after describing their first-hand reports of experiences of extraordinary states of consciousness, presented also their traditional interpretations. The result seems to indicate a great variety of mystical experience, and clear differences in how these were understood theologically. Many experiences seems to evidence a particular world view, e.g., theisms, monisms, dualisms, pantheisms, or agnostic.\n\nHis critique challenged the thesis of Richard Bucke, developed in his 1901 book, \"Cosmic Consciousness\". Bucke describes certain lesser facilities, followed by accounts of the prized 'cosmic' state of mind. Fourteen exemplary people of history as presented, shown as each reaching a somewhat similar realization: the plane of cosmic consciousness.\n\nThis idea, called the Perennial philosophy, has been variously advanced, e.g., by Aldous Huxley, by Frithjof Schuon, by Houston Smith. Zaehner does not dispute that these spiritual visionaries reach a distinguishable level of awareness. Nor does he deny that by following a disciplined life sequence over time one may be led to mystical experience: withdrawal, purgation, illumination. Instead, what Zaeher suggests is a profound difference between, e.g., the pantheistic vision of a nature mystic, admittedly pleasant and wholesome, and the personal union of a theist with the Divine lover of humankind.\n\nZaehner's study of mystical writings also incorporated its psychological dimensions, yet as a supplement, not as definitive. About the experience of unusual states of consciousness, many mystics have written using as a descriptive metaphor language associated with marriage symbolism or sexuality.\n\nAbrahamic religions traditionally identify the gender of the supreme Being as male. In Islam and in Christianity, the soul of the often male sufi or mystic, following his spiritual discipline, may encounter the holy presence of the male Deity. The Christian Church as a whole, as a community of souls, for millennia has been self-described as the Bride of Christ.\n\nAcross centuries and continents, mystics have used erotic metaphors and sexual analogies in descriptions of Divine love. The special states of consciousness they recorded have become the subject of modern psychological studies, e.g., by the school of C. G. Jung (favored by Zaehner). Among Christian mystics Teresa de Jesús (1515-1582) employed the spiritual marriage metaphor in writing about her experiences. Mechthild von Magdeburg (c.1208-182/1294) provides a special example of the woman mystic.\n\nAlong with other authors, Zaehner writes of the mystics' marriage symbolism and erotic imagery. He quotes an exemplary passage of François de Sales (1567-1622), then continues: \"Both in mystical rapture and in sexual union reason and intelligence are momentarily set at naught. The soul 'flows' and 'hurls itself out of itself'. ...all consciousness of the ego has disappeared. As the Buddhist would say, there is no longer any 'I' or 'mine', the ego has been swallowed up into a greater whole.\"\nYet, when approaching this delecate subject, especially at the chaotic threshold to a New Age, the rapid changes afoot may confound sex talk and conflate opposites, which elicits diverse commentary. Regarding the transcultural experience of mystical states, however, the traditional analogy of marriage symbolism continues to endure, drawing interest and advocates. An augment the above examples is the Dutch mystic Jan van Ruusbroec (1239-1381).\n\nZaehner evolved into a committed Christian, whose ethics and morals were founded on his Catholic faith. Accordingly, sexuality is blessed within the context of marriage. His sexual orientation during World War II was said to have been homosexual. During his later life, while a don at Oxford, he became wholly devoted to teaching, research and writing; he abstained from sexual activity.\n\nAs described above, the typology of mystical practice and experience was derived directly from the Hindu tradition and its literature. Dasgupta was the source of the schema, which was truncated and modified by Zaehner.\n\nIn 1958 Zaehner had presented a general analysis of the range of mystical experience in the form of a typology. This schema's aim was to reflect both the mystic's report of the experience itself and the mystic's personal 'explanation' of it. Commentaries found in spiritual literature were also referenced. The explanations are usually expressed in terms of a traditional religious heritage. Of typologies suggested by Zaehner, the following appears to be the most exemplary:\n\nAn endemic problem with such an analytic typology is the elusive nature of the conscious experience during the mystical state, its shifting perspectives of subject/object, and the psychology of spiritual awareness itself. In addition, each category is hardly pure, in that there is a great variety of overlap between them. Furthermore, each religion appears to field contending schools of mystical thought, and often interpretations of conscious states may differ within each of the schools. When a list of the several proposed typologies made by Zaehner over the years are mustered and compared, the results are found to be \"unstable\". Accordingly, an observer might conclude that the spiritual map of possible mysticisms would present a confused jumble through which snake perplexing pathways. Zaehner's proposals suffer from these endemic difficulties.\n\n\"Nota bene\": Kripal remarks that Zaehner is known for a \"tripartite typology of mystical states\". However here four types are listed, in which Zaehner's \"Isolation\" composite is divided in its two components: the Dualist, and the Monistic. These two types may be open to an interpretation which deems them as functionally equivalent, yet as self-defined the Monistic experience (of Vedanta) is not an isolated event but instead is connected to the cosmos.\n\nNature mysticism is a term used to catalogue generally those spontaneous experiences of an \"oceanic feeling\" in which a person identifies with nature, or is similarly thrown back in awe of the unforgettable, vast sweep of the cosmos. Such may be described philosophically as a form of pantheism, or often as pan-en-hen-ic. Nature mysicism may also include such a state of consciousness induced by drugs. Like Aldous Huxley he had taken mescalin, but Zaehner came to a different conclusion. In his 1957 book \"Mysticism. Sacred and Profane. An Inquiry into some Varieties of Praeternatural Experience\", there is a narrative description of the author's experience under the influence of mescalin.\n\nIn part, about nature mysticism, Zaehner relies on William James, Carl Jung, a personal experience recorded by Martin Buber, the descriptions of Marcel Proust and of Arthur Rimbaud, among others. and writings of Richard Jeffries and of Richard Maurice Bucke, The Hindu Upanishads were viewed by Zaehner as \"a genuine bridge\" between nature mysticism and theistic mysticism.\n\nA primary aims of Zaehner appeared to be making the distinction between a morally open experience found in nature mysticism as contrasted with the beatific vision of the theist. Zaehner set himself against Aldous Huxley's style of the Perennial Philosophy which held as uniform all mystical experience. Accordingly, he understood Huxley's interpretation of 'nature mysticism' as naïve, self-referent, and inflated, an idea seeded with future misunderstandings. Yet, considering Huxley's conversion to Vedanta and to his immersion in Zen, Zaehner arrived at an appraisal of Huxley that was nuanced, and selectively in accord.\n\nSamkhya philosophy is an ancient dualist doctrine of India. In appraising the experienced world, Samkhya understood it as composed mostly of prakrti (nature, unconscious matter), but also of purusa (the human soul aware). Its dualism puts in contrast the objective seen (prakriti) and the subjective seer (purusa). Long ago Yoga adherents adopted doctrines of Samkhya. As a person pursues his spiritual quest under Samkhya-yoga, his \"immortal\" soul (purusa) emerges, becomes more and more defined and distinct, as it separates from entangling nature (prakriti). Prakriti includes even the nature affecting personal qualities, such as the three gunas (modes), the \"buddhi\" (universal intellect), the mind (\"manas\"), \"the body\", the ahamkara (the ego): all of which the purusa sheds. Of the resulting refined and purified \"purusa\" there is yielded the eternity of the yogin's true Self in isolation. \n\nAn advanced mystic may attain a recurrent state of tranquil, steady illumination in meditative isolation. The Samkhya understands this as the benign emergence within the practicing yogin of his own purified, immortal \"purusa\". A plurality of purusas exist, as many as there are people. A mystic's own \"purusa\" generally is about identical to the many other isolated purusas, each separately experienced from within, by millions of other humans. Under the Samkhya, Hindus may refer to this personal, isolated experience of immortality as the purified self, the \"purusa\", or otherwise called the personal atman (Sanskrit: self). \"Au contraire\", a Hindu mystic following a rival school of Vedanta may understand the same tranquil, steady illumination differently (i.e., as not Samkhya's purusa). As Zaehner proposed: the same or similar mystical experience may result in very different theological interpretations.\n\nInstead of the isolated purusa experience of Samkhya, the Advaita Vedanta mystic might interpret it as the experience of the Self, which illuminates the mystic's direct connection to the all-inclusive entity of \"cosmic totality\". Such a numinous, universal Self is called Brahman (\"Sanskrit\": sacred power), or Paramatma. Here, the Samkhya understands an isolated, purified, eternal purusa (self); the contrary Vedanta mystic would experience a connection to the cosmic Brahman.\n\nHence, the mystical experience (briefly outlined here) is differently interpreted; the subject: (1) may achieve, by separation from prakriti (nature), the goal of immortality of her purusa, purified in isolation within herself; or (2) may become absorbed by discovery of her direct identity with the divine, immortal, luminous Brahman, Accordingly, in Zaehner's terms, such experience may be either (1) a \"dualistic\" Samkhya atheism, or (2) a \"monistic\" type of Advaita Vedanta. Neither for Zaehner can be called \"theistic\", i.e., in neither case is there an interactive, sacred experience with a numinous personality.\n\n[Under construction]\n\nIn non-dualist Vedanta, the Hindu mystic would understand \"reality\" as nothing but the Divine Unity, inclusive of the mystic subject herself. A special, awesome, impersonal \"Presence\" may be experienced. The persistent Hindu, after years of prescriptive discipline to purge her soul, may discover a sacred ocean or inner stream of Being, the Brahman. Such conscious spiritual energy conveys bliss, and transformation.\n\nWhat is called 'nature' (prakriti in Samkhya), philosophically, does not exist, according to the Advaita Vedanta of Samkara. The objective 'other' is ultimately an illusion or maya. A realized person's antaratma or inner self is directly identical the paramatma, the Supreme Soul or Brahman. As the \"Upanishads\" states to the seeker, \"thou art that\", Tat Tvam Asi, i.e., the personal atma \"is\" the divine Atma. What Samkhya darsana mistakes for an isolated purusa (self) is really the Brahman: the whole of the universe; all else is illusion. Brahma is being, consciousness, bliss.\nZaehner focused especially on some Hindu forms of mysticism, i.e., the Astika of the dualist Samkhya and of the non-dualist Vedanta. Not addressed as well were other forms of mysticism, e.g., the Theravada, the Mahayana, the Islamic, and Sankara, Ramauja, as well as various Sufis.\n\nThe non-dualist finds a complete unity within a subjective sovereignty: ultimately absorption in a \"numinous\" presence, the absolute; its is a meditative perception of an all-encompassing \"we\" without any \"they\". The Samkhya dualist, however, understands that in transcendent meditation he will perceive himself as an isolated purusa, purified from enmeshment in an 'objective' prakrti. The mystic experience itself as found in Hindu literature Zaehner presents, as well as its theological filter of explanation.\n\n[Under construction]\n\nAccording to Zaehner, Christianity and theistic religions offer the possibility of a sacred mystical union with an attentive creator God, whereas a strictly monistic approach instead leads to the self-unity experience of natural religion. Yet Zaehner remained hopeful in the long run of an ever-increasing understanding between religions. \"We have much to learn from Eastern religions, and we have much too to give them; but we are always in danger of forgetting the art of giving--of giving without strings... .\"\n\nMystical union between the mystic and the Deity in a sense confounds the distinction between dualistic and monistic mysticism. For if the two are identical already, there is no potential for the act of union. Yet the act of divine union also negates a continuous dualism.\n\nDuring the 1940s spent in Iran he returned to the Christian faith. Decades later he published \"The Catholic Church and World Religions\" (1964), expressly from that perspective. As an objective scholar, he drew on his acquired insights from this source to further his understanding of others. Zaehner \"did not choose to write to convince others of the truth of his own faith,\" rather \"to frame questions\" was his usual purpose.\n\nHis translations and the \"Hinduism\" book \"made Zaehner one of the most important modern exponents of Hindu theological and philosophical doctrines... . The works on mysticism are more controversial though they established important distinctions in refusing to regard all mysticisms as the same,\" wrote Prof. Geoffrey Parrinder. For Zaehner's \"Hindu and Muslim Mysticism\" (1960), and like analyses, see \"Comparative Mysticism\" section.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Christ Church in Oxford, Zaehner studied several Persian languages. He also taught himself a related language, Sanskrit, used to write the early Hindu sacred books. Decades later he was asked by OUP to author a volume on Hinduism. Unexpectedly Zaehner insisted on first reading in Sanscrit the Mahabharata, a very long epic. More than an heroic age story of an ancient war, the \"Mahabharata\" gives us the foremost compendium on Hindu religion and way of life.\n\nThe resulting treatise \"Hinduism\" (1962) is elegant, deep, and short. Zaehner discusses, among other things, the subtleties of dharma, and Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, who became the King of righteousness (\"dharma raja\"). Yudhishthira is the elder of five brothers of the royal Pandava family, who leads one side in the war of the \"Mahabharata\". Accordingly, he struggles to follow his conscience, to do the right thing, to avoid slaughter and bloodshed. Yet he finds that tradition and custom, and the Lord Krishna, are ready to allow the usual killing and mayhem of warfare.\n\nAs explained in \"Hinduism\", all his life Yudhishthira struggles to follow his conscience. Yet when Yudhishthira participates in the battle of Kuruksetra, he is told by Krishna to state a \"half truth\" meant to deceive. Zaehner discusses: Yudhishthira and moksha (liberation), and karma; and Yudhishthira's troubles with warrior caste dharma. In the last chapter, Yudhishthira 'returns' as Mahatma Gandhi. Other chapters discuss the early literature of the Vedas, the deities, Bhakti devotional practices begun in medieval India, and the encounter with, and response to, modern Europeans.\n\nZaehenr continued his discussion of Yudhishthira in a chapter of his book based on his 1967-1969 Gifford Lectures. Zaehner finds analogies between the Mahabharata's Yudhishthira and the biblical Job. Yet their situations differed. Yudhishthira, although ascetic by nature, was a royal leader who had to directly face the conflicts of his society. His realm and his family suffered great misfortunes due to political conflict and war. Yet the divine Krishna evidently considered the war and the destructive duties of the warrior (the \"kshatriya dharma\") acceptable. The wealthy householder Job, a faithful servant of his Deity, suffers severe family and personal reversals, due to Divine acquiescence. Each human being, both Job and Yudhishthira, is committed to following his righteous duty, acting in conforming to his conscience.\n\nWhen the family advisor Vidura reluctantly challenges him to play dice at Dhrtarastra's palace, \"Yudhishthira believes it is against his moral code to decline a challenge.\" Despite, or because of, his devotion to the law of \"dharma\", Yudhishthira then \"allowed himself be tricked into a game of dice.\" In contesting against very cunning and clever players, he gambles \"his kingdom and family away.\" His wife becomes threatened with slavery.\n\nEven so, initially Yudhishthira with \"holy indifference\" tries to \"defend traditional dharma\" and like Job to \"justify the ways of God in the eyes of men.\" Yet his disgraced wife Draupadi dramatically attacks Krishna for \"playing with his creatures as children play with dolls.\" Although his wife escapes slavery, the bitter loss in the dice game is only a step in the sequence of seemingly divinely-directed events that led to a disastrous war, involving enormous slaughter. Although Yudhishthira is the King of Dharma, eventually he harshly criticizes the bloody duties of a warrior (the \"kshatriya dharma\"), duties imposed also on kings. Yudhishthira himself prefers the \"constant virtues\" mandated by the dharma of a brahmin. \"Krishna represents the old order,\" interprets Zaehner, where \"trickery and violence\" hold \"an honorable place\".\n\nIn his \"Hindu Scriptures\" (1966) Zaehner presents his translations of classics, India's ancient sacred texts, selections of the Rig-Veda, the Atharva-Veda, the Upanishads, and the entire, 80-page \"Bhagavad Gita\". He discusses these writings in his short Introduction. A brief Glossary of Names is at the end. \"Zaehner's extraordinary command of the texts\" wast widely admired by his academic peers.\n\nThat year Zaehner published an extensively annotated \"Bhagavad Gita\", a celebrated and prized episode of the \"Mahabharata\" epic. Before the great battle, the Lord Krishna discusses with the Pandava brother Arjuna the enduring spiritual realities. Krishna \"was not merely a local prince of no very great importance: he was God incarnate--the great God Vishnu who has taken on human flesh and blood.\" Provided after his translation, is Zaehner's long Commentary, drawn from the medieval sages Sankara and Ramanuja, ancient scriptures and epics, and modern scholars. His Introduction places the \"Gita\" within the context of the \"Mahabharata\" and of Hindu philosophy. Hindu religious teachings in the \"Gita\" are addressed in terms of the individual Self, material Nature, Liberation, and Deity. A useful Appendix is organized by main subject, and under each are \"quoted in full\" the relevant passages, giving chapter and verse.\n\nIn his 1971 book \"Evolution in Religion\", Zaehner discusses Sri Aurobindo Ghose (1872–1950), a modern Hindu spiritual teacher, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), a French palaeontologist and Jesuit visionary. Zaehner discusses each, and appraises their religious innovations.\n\nAurobindo at age seven was sent to England for education, eventually studying western classics at Cambridge University. On his return to Bengal in India, he studied its ancient literature in Sanskrit. He later became a major political orator with a spiritual dimension, a prominent leader for Indian independence. Hence he was jailed. There in 1908 he had a religious experience. Relocating to the then French port of Pondicherry, he became a yogin and was eventually recognized as a Hindu sage. Sri Aurobindo's writings reinterpret the Hindu traditions. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, later President of India, praised him. \"As a poet, philosopher, and mystic, Sri Aurobindo occupies a place of the highest eminence in the history of modern India.\"\n\nAurobindo, Zaehner wrote, \"could not accept the Vedanta in its classic non-dualist formulation, for he had come to accept Darwinism and Bergson's idea of \"creative\" evolution.\" If the One being was \"totally static\" as previously understood \"then there could be no room for evolution, creativity, or development of any kind.\" Instead, as reported by Zaehner, Aurobindo considered that \"the One though absolutely self sufficient unto itself, must also be the source... of progressive, evolutionary change.\" He found \"the justification for his dynamic interpretation of the Vedanta in the Hindu Scriptures themselves, particularly in the Bhagavad-Gita.\" According to Aurobindo, the aim of his new yoga was:\n\n\"[A] change in consciousness radical and complete\" of no less a jump in \"spiritual evolution\" than \"what took place when a mentalised being first appeared in a vital and material animal world.\" Regarding his new \"Integral Yoga\": \"The thing to be gained is the bringing in of a Power of Consciousness... not yet organized or active directly in earth-nature, ...but yet to be organized and made directly active.\"\n\nAurobindo foresees that a Power of Consciousness will eventually work a collective transformation in human beings, making us then actually able to form and sustain societies of liberté, égalité, fraternité. Adherents of Aurobindo's new Integral Yoga (\"Purna Yoga\") would lead India to a spiritual awakening; they would facilitate an increasingly common soul-experience, in which each achieves a mystic union with the One. Each such \"gnosis\" would also be guided by the Power of Consciousness. In choosing to pursue the realization of such social self-understanding, India would hasten the natural evolution of humanity. Hence furthering the conscious commitment everywhere, to collaborate with the hidden drive of creative evolution toward a spiritual advance, is high among the missions of Aurobindo's new 'Integral Yoga'. \"It must be remembered that there is Aurobindo the socialist and Aurobindo the mystic.\"\n\nZaehner gave the Gifford Lectures in Scotland during the years 1967–1969. In these sessions he revisits comparative mysticism and Bucke, focuses on Hinduism and Buddhism, Yudhishthira and later Job, discusses Taoist classics, Neo-Confucianism, and Zen. He doesn't forget Jung or Zoroaster, Marx or Teilhard. The result is a 464-page book: \"Concordant Discord. The Interdependence of Faiths\".\n\nIn the course of the discourse, he mentions occasionally a sophisticated view: how the different religions have provided a mutuality of nourishment, having almost unconsciously interpenetrated each other's beliefs. The historically obfuscated result is that neighbouring religions might develop the other's theological insights as their own, as well as employ the other's distinctions to accent, or explain, their own doctrines to themselves. Although Zaehner gives a suggestive commentary at the conjunction of living faiths, he respects that each remains distinct, unique. Zaehner allows the possibility of what he calls the convergence of faiths, or solidarity.\n\nRegarding the world religions Zaehner held, however, that we cannot use the occasional occurrence of an ironic syncretism among elites as a platform from which to leap to a unity within current religions. His rear-guard opinions conflicted with major academic trends then prevailing. \"In these ecumenical days it is unfashionable to emphasize the difference between religions.\" Yet Zaehner remained skeptical, at the risk of alienating those in the ecumenical movement whose longing for a festival of conciliation caused them to overlook the stubborn divergence inherent in the momentum. \"We must force nothing: we must not try to achieve a 'harmony' of religions at all costs when all we can yet see is a 'concordant discord'... . At this early stage of contact with the non-Christian religions, this surely is the most that we can hope for.\"\n\nZaehner used a comparative-religion approach in his several discussions of Communism, both as philosophical-religious theory (discussed below), and here in its practical business of control over a sovereign state. In its ideological management of political and economic operations, Soviet party rule was said to demonstrate an attenuated resemblance to Catholic Church governance. Features in common included an authoritarian command structure (similar to the military), guided by an unquestionable theory or a dogma, which was articulated in abstract principles and exemplars.\n\nFor the Marxist-Leninist adherent, the 'laws of nature', i.e., dialectical materialism, was the orthodox, mandatory scientism, which dominated political-economic society through its application, historical materialism. Hence, a complex dialectic involving class conflict provided a key to these \"natural\" laws, however difficult to decipher.\n\n\"Stalin saw, quite rightly, that since the laws of Nature manifested themselves in the tactical vicissitudes of day-to-day politics with no sort of clarity, even the most orthodox Marxists were bound to go astray. It was, therefore, necessary that some one man whose authority was absolute, should be found to pronounce \"ex cathedra\" what the correct reading of historical necessity was. Such a man he found in himself.\"\n\nA Soviet hierarchical system thus developed during the Stalinist era, which appeared to be a perverse copy of the organization of the Roman Catholic Church. Zaehner did not overlook the hideous, deadly atrocities, whether massive or continuous, perpetrated during Stalin's rule, chiefly on his own overworked citizenry. Zaehner was, however, interested in the art of popular motivation, in the visionary import and quasi-religious dimension of selected aspects of Marx and Engels, that might interest free peoples. He declined further analysis of the misanthropic exploitation by the Leninist party of its ugly monopoly of state power.\n\nMarxist ideology has been compared to religious theology. Zaehner explored its explicitly \"materialist\" function, an ancient philosophical notion developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which was inserted into Hegel's system of dialectics. Zaehner's subtle understanding allowed him to conjecture about such a putative dynamic of matter. An analogy was to historical effects caused by the social-developmental role of the Spirit in Christianity. Zaehner here was inspired by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. \n\nFriedrich Engels in his later life had combined a type of \"Marxian materialism, Darwinian evolution, and eastern mysticism\" in a philosophy that resembled religious teaching. This theme was, however, not taken up or developed in an Marxist-Leninist context. Writing in an philosophical mode, Engels utilized \"a religion without a personal God and even without a Hegelian Absolute\" in pursuit of fostering his nascent communist ideology.\n\nAbout the materialist dialectic itself, its signature political application was to a conjectured history of class warfare, in theory the replacement of the bourgeoise (thesis) by the proletariat (antithesis), resulting in a 'classless society' (synthesis). Such dialectic has drawn widely different interpretations. Zaehner was able to pick out the finer notions in the humanistic vision of Karl Marx to celebrate.\n\n[Under construction]\n\nThe interaction of evolutionary science and of social studies with traditional religions thought, particularly Christian, drew Zaehner's attention. Serving him as a catalyst were the writings on evolution by Teilhard de Chardin, and on mescaline by Aldous Huxley. Engendered is the mystical body of Christ as an active symbol of transformation, Christianity as a soul collective, which carries \"the promise of sanctification to the material world re-created by man.\"\n\nThe physical potential in inorganic \"matter\", according to Teilhard, 'spontaneously' develops into life organisms that reproduce, then such living \"matter\" eventually evolves consciousness, until \"eons hence\" a Christological collective \"Omega Point\" will be reached. The issue of such a future humanity-wide salvation on earth, in juxtaposition to the orthodox salvation of each individual confirmed at death, is apprehended and discussed. While energized and often favorable, Zaehner could turn a more critical eye toward Teilhard, while acknowledging his advocacy for the poor.\n\nJuxtaposing (1) a spiritual understanding of graphic biblical stories, often from Genesis, that illuminate the human choices and conflicts, with (2) a conjectured historical narrative of early human society, Zaehner would then employ psychology and literature to craft an anthropology of modern social norms, within a spiritual commentary.\n\nIn a few different books Zaehner retold in several versions the 'simple' story of the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve start in an unconscious state, analogous to prehistoric human beings. They remain unaware of good or evil, unconscious of sin. Tasting the forbidden fruit, however, of the tree of knowledge, offered by the serpent, opens their eyes. This their original sin results in their awakening. They are naked in the garden, they must leave it. Once unconsciously they enjoyed the free bounty of nature, but now they must work for a living and create a fallen human society to live in. Zaehner writes:\n\nThe discovery of evolution hit the Christian churches hard... . [T]he \"Genesis\" story has to be interpreted against the background of our evolutionary origin. Once we do this, then the Fall begins to look more like an ascent than a degradation. For self-consciousness which transforms man into a \"rational\" animal is a qualitative leap in the evolutionary process... life becomes conscious of itself.\n\nIn the multiple discussions referenced above, Zaehner is referring to the long-term cultural evolution of human societies, which happens in the wake of the billion-year biological evolution by natural selection. Of the later our bodies are heirs. Of the former our consciousness takes the lead. Sri Aurobindo, the subject of another book by Zaehner, advocated a disciplined commitment of the spirit, informed by yoga, to advancing the cultural evolution of the species.\n\nIn his last three books, \"Drugs, Mysticism and Makebelieve\" (1972), \"Our Savage God\" (1974), and \"City within the Heart\" (1981) [posthumous], Zaehner turned to address issues in contemporary society, drawing on his studies of comparative religion. He further explored the similarities and the differences between drug-induced experiences and traditional mysticism. As an academic he had already published several books on such issues starting in 1957. In the meantime, a widespread counterculture had arisen, often called New Age, which included artists, rebels, and youth. Their psychedelic experiences were often self-explained spiritually, with reference to zen and eastern mysticism. Consequently, Zaehner wanted to reach this \"wider public\". During the late 1960s he was \"very often invited to talk on the BBC.\"\n\nZaehner described various ancient quests to attain a mystical state of transcendence, of unification. Therein all contradictions and oppositions are reconciled; subject and object disappear, one passes beyond good and evil. That said, such a monist view can logically lead to excess, even to criminal acts. If practiced under the guidance of traditional religious teachers, no harm usually results. The potential for evil exists, however, through subtle misunderstanding or careless enthusiasm, according to Zaehner. After arriving at such a transcendent point, a troubled drug user may go wrong by feeling licensed to do anything, with no moral limit. The misuse of a mystical state and its theology eventually can lead to an horrific end.\n\nZaehner warned of the misbehavior propagated by LSD advocate Timothy Leary, the earlier satanism of Aleister Crowley, and ultimately the criminal depravity of Charles Manson. His essay \"Rot in the Clockwork Orange\" further illustrates from popular culture the possible brutal effects of such moral confusion and license.\n\nYet Zaehner's detailed examination and review was not a witch hunt. His concluding appraisal of the LSD experience, although not without warning of its great risks and dangers, contained a limited, circumscribed allowance for use with a spiritual guide.\n\nAs its title indicates, the book addresses a range of contemporary issues. It was expanded from three talks he gave on BBC radio in 1970, which were printed in \"The Listener\" [9]. Although admittedly it repeats some material from his prior books, it is \"aimed at a wider audience\" (p. 9).\n\nIn his appraisal of LSD the psychedelic drug and its relevance to mysticism, Zaehner discussed the drug's popular advocate Timothy Leary and his 1970 book. Zaehner comments that, to the inexperienced, \"most descriptions of Zen enlightenment, and some of LSD experience would appear to be almost identical.\" What Leary calls the \"timeless energy process around you\" (pp. 113–114 quote; 70 & 112 quote). Yet Zaehner refers to Krishnamurti of India, and zen abbot Zenkei Shibayama of Japan. Apparently each describes a crucial difference between meditation and such experiences as LSD (pp. 114–116).\n\nThe celebration of sex while under its influence by Leary and also by many in the drug culture Zaehner compared to the frequent use of sexual imagery by the mystics of different religious cultures [63, 66-70]. Even though passages in Leary's book comport with the Hindu Upanishads, Zaehner writes that by Leary's near deification of sexuality he \"would appear to part company\" with most nature mystics and, e.g., with St. Francis de Sales, who distinguishes mystical ecstasy and sexual ecstasy (pp. 68–69, 70 quote). In later discussing Georges Bernanos, Zaehner opines that \"sex without love\" would constitute an abandonment of the virtues (pp. 174–175).\n\nZaehner discusses Carl Jung and his 1952 book \"Answer to Job\" (pp. 163–170).\n\nThe book's title is somewhat misleading. It attaches well, however, to its first chapter, \"Rot in the Clockwork Orange\", about the putative rationale of then contemporary episodes of mayhem and murder. About the hippie psychotic fringe, it made world headlines. Zaehner's focus is not on usual criminality but on hideous acts claiming a religious sanction, that with sinister cunning fakes the 'new age' (p. 12). The chapter's title refers to the 1962 novel by Anthony Burgess and the 1971 film by Stanley Kubrick (p. 35). Portrayed therein is crazy, soul-killing violence.\n\nYet, very differently, about his book on the whole Zaehner says its hero is Aristotle. The supporting cast is drawn from his \"philosophical milieu\" (p. 14). The next four chapters cover: Heraclitus per a dialectical unity of opposites (pp. 92, 102); Parmenides whose \"Way of Truth\" is compared to the Vedanta's Brahman (121-122); Plato (141-160); and the stagirite hero who arrives at Being, akin to \"Sat-Cit-Ananda\" (p. 192). As indicated, Zaehner offers a comparison of these Ancient Greek philosophers to the Vedic wisdom of ancient India, especially the mythopoetic element in the \"Upanishads\" (e.g., p. 133-138).\n\nYet this philosophical theme is somewhat misleading as well, for Zaehner intermittently interjects the ever-present and unwelcome possibility of criminality and mayhem. Charles Manson on occasion appears as the personification of the evil side of contemporary drug culture. His depraved mystical con-game provides some unappetizing food for thought.\n\n\n\nSELECTED ARTICLES:\nAS TRANSLATOR/EDITOR:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210759", "title": "Finite strain theory", "text": "Finite strain theory\n\nIn continuum mechanics, the finite strain theory—also called large strain theory, or large deformation theory—deals with deformations in which strains and/or rotations are large enough to invalidate assumptions inherent in infinitesimal strain theory. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different, requiring a clear distinction between them. This is commonly the case with elastomers, plastically-deforming materials and other fluids and biological soft tissue.\n\nThe displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation.\n\nA change in the configuration of a continuum body can be described by a displacement field. A \"displacement field\" is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. The distance between any two particles changes if and only if deformation has occurred. If displacement occurs without deformation, then it is a rigid-body displacement.\n\nThe displacement of particles indexed by variable may be expressed as follows. The vector joining the positions of a particle in the undeformed configuration formula_3 and deformed configuration formula_4 is called the displacement vector. Using formula_5 in place of formula_3 and formula_7 in place of formula_4, both of which are vectors from the origin of the coordinate system to each respective point, we have the Lagrangian description of the displacement vector:\n\nWhere formula_10 are the orthonormal unit vectors that define the basis of the spatial (lab-frame) coordinate system.\n\nExpressed in terms of the material coordinates, the displacement field is:\n\nWhere formula_12 is the displacement vector representing rigid-body translation.\n\nThe partial derivative of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the \"material displacement gradient tensor\" formula_13. Thus we have,\nwhere formula_15 is the \"deformation gradient tensor\".\n\nIn the Eulerian description, the vector extending from a particle formula_16 in the undeformed configuration to its location in the deformed configuration is called the displacement vector:\n\nWhere formula_18 are the unit vectors that define the basis of the material (body-frame) coordinate system.\n\nExpressed in terms of spatial coordinates, the displacement field is:\n\nThe partial derivative of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the \"spatial displacement gradient tensor\" formula_20. Thus we have,\n\nformula_22 are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors formula_23 and formula_10, respectively. Thus\n\nThe relationship between formula_26 and formula_27 is then given by\n\nKnowing that\nthen\n\nIt is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the deformed and undeformed configurations, which results in formula_31, and the direction cosines become Kronecker deltas, i.e.\n\nThus in material (undeformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:\n\nAnd in spatial (deformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor formula_35 is related to both the reference and current configuration, as seen by the unit vectors formula_36 and formula_37, therefore it is a \"two-point tensor\".\n\nDue to the assumption of continuity of formula_38, formula_15 has the inverse formula_40, where formula_41 is the \"spatial deformation gradient tensor\". Then, by the implicit function theorem, the Jacobian determinant formula_42 must be nonsingular, i.e. formula_43\n\nThe \"material deformation gradient tensor\" formula_35 is a second-order tensor that represents the gradient of the mapping function or functional relation formula_38, which describes the motion of a continuum. The material deformation gradient tensor characterizes the local deformation at a material point with position vector formula_46, i.e. deformation at neighbouring points, by transforming (linear transformation) a material line element emanating from that point from the reference configuration to the current or deformed configuration, assuming continuity in the mapping function formula_38, i.e. differentiable function of formula_48 and time formula_49, which implies that cracks and voids do not open or close during the deformation. Thus we have,\n\nConsider a particle or material point formula_16 with position vector formula_52 in the undeformed configuration (Figure 2). After a displacement of the body, the new position of the particle indicated by formula_53 in the new configuration is given by the vector position formula_54. The coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configuration can be superimposed for convenience.\n\nConsider now a material point formula_55 neighboring formula_16, with position vector formula_57. In the deformed configuration this particle has a new position formula_58 given by the position vector formula_59. Assuming that the line segments formula_60 and formula_61 joining the particles formula_16 and formula_63 in both the undeformed and deformed configuration, respectively, to be very small, then we can express them as formula_64 and formula_65. Thus from Figure 2 we have\n\nwhere formula_67 is the relative displacement vector, which represents the relative displacement of formula_63 with respect to formula_16 in the deformed configuration.\n\nFor an infinitesimal element formula_64, and assuming continuity on the displacement field, it is possible to use a Taylor series expansion around point formula_16, neglecting higher-order terms, to approximate the components of the relative displacement vector for the neighboring particle formula_63 as\nThus, the previous equation formula_74 can be written as\n\nCalculations that involve the time-dependent deformation of a body often require a time derivative of the deformation gradient to be calculated. A geometrically consistent definition of such a derivative requires an excursion into differential geometry but we avoid those issues in this article.\n\nThe time derivative of formula_76 is\nwhere formula_78 is the velocity. The derivative on the right hand side represents a material velocity gradient. It is common to convert that into a spatial gradient, i.e.,\nwhere formula_80 is the spatial velocity gradient. If the spatial velocity gradient is constant, the above equation can be solved exactly to give\nassuming formula_82 at formula_83. There are several methods of computing the exponential above.\n\nRelated quantities often used in continuum mechanics are the rate of deformation tensor and the spin tensor defined, respectively, as:\nThe rate of deformation tensor gives the rate of stretching of line elements while the spin tensor indicates the rate of rotation or vorticity of the motion.\n\nTo transform quantities that are defined with respect to areas in a deformed configuration to those relative to areas in a reference configuration, and vice versa, we use Nanson's relation, expressed as\n\nwhere formula_86 is an area of a region in the deformed configuration, formula_87 is the same area in the reference configuration, and formula_88 is the outward normal to the area element in the current configuration while formula_89 is the outward normal in the reference configuration, formula_90 is the deformation gradient, and formula_91.\n\nThe corresponding formula for the transformation of the volume element is \n\nThe deformation gradient formula_90, like any invertible second-order tensor, can be decomposed, using the polar decomposition theorem, into a product of two second-order tensors (Truesdell and Noll, 1965): an orthogonal tensor and a positive definite symmetric tensor, i.e.\n\nwhere the tensor formula_95 is a proper orthogonal tensor, i.e. formula_96 and formula_97, representing a rotation; the tensor formula_98 is the \"right stretch tensor\"; and formula_99 the \"left stretch tensor\". The terms \"right\" and \"left\" means that they are to the right and left of the rotation tensor formula_95, respectively. formula_98 and formula_99 are both positive definite, i.e. formula_103 and formula_104 for all formula_105, and symmetric tensors, i.e. formula_106 and formula_107, of second order.\n\nThis decomposition implies that the deformation of a line element formula_64 in the undeformed configuration onto formula_65 in the deformed configuration, i.e. formula_110, may be obtained either by first stretching the element by formula_111, i.e. formula_112, followed by a rotation formula_113, i.e. formula_114; or equivalently, by applying a rigid rotation formula_113 first, i.e. formula_116, followed later by a stretching formula_117, i.e. formula_118 (See Figure 3).\n\nDue to the orthogonality of formula_119\n\nso that formula_111 and formula_117 have the same eigenvalues or \"principal stretches\", but different eigenvectors or \"principal directions\" formula_123 and formula_124, respectively. The principal directions are related by\n\nThis polar decomposition, which is unique as formula_15 is invertible with a positive determinant, is a corrolary of the singular-value decomposition.\n\nSeveral rotation-independent deformation tensors are used in mechanics. In solid mechanics, the most popular of these are the right and left Cauchy–Green deformation tensors.\n\nSince a pure rotation should not induce any strains in a deformable body, it is often convenient to use rotation-independent measures of deformation in continuum mechanics. As a rotation followed by its inverse rotation leads to no change (formula_127) we can exclude the rotation by multiplying formula_90 by its transpose.\n\nIn 1839, George Green introduced a deformation tensor known as the \"right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor\" or \"Green's deformation tensor\", defined as:\n\nPhysically, the Cauchy–Green tensor gives us the square of local change in distances due to deformation, i.e. formula_130\n\nInvariants of formula_131 are often used in the expressions for strain energy density functions. The most commonly used invariants are\nwhere formula_133 are stretch ratios for the unit fibers that are initially oriented along the eigenvector directions of the right (reference) stretch tensor (these are not generally aligned with the three axis of the coordinate systems).\n\nThe IUPAC recommends that the inverse of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor (called the Cauchy tensor in that document), i. e., formula_134, be called the Finger tensor. However, that nomenclature is not universally accepted in applied mechanics.\n\nReversing the order of multiplication in the formula for the right Green–Cauchy deformation tensor leads to the \"left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor\" which is defined as:\n\nThe left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is often called the \"Finger deformation tensor\", named after Josef Finger (1894).\n\nInvariants of formula_137 are also used in the expressions for strain energy density functions. The conventional invariants are defined as\nwhere formula_139 is the determinant of the deformation gradient.\n\nFor incompressible materials, a slightly different set of invariants is used:\n\nEarlier in 1828, Augustin Louis Cauchy introduced a deformation tensor defined as the inverse of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, formula_141. This tensor has also been called the Piola tensor and the Finger tensor in the rheology and fluid dynamics literature.\n\nIf there are three distinct principal stretches formula_143, the spectral decompositions of formula_131 and formula_137 is given by\n\nFurthermore,\n\nObserve that\nTherefore, the uniqueness of the spectral decomposition also implies that formula_150. The left stretch (formula_99) is also called the \"spatial stretch tensor\" while the right stretch (formula_98) is called the \"material stretch tensor\".\n\nThe effect of formula_90 acting on formula_123 is to stretch the vector by formula_133 and to rotate it to the new orientation formula_124, i.e.,\nIn a similar vein, \n\nDerivatives of the stretch with respect to the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor are used to derive the stress-strain relations of many solids, particularly hyperelastic materials. These derivatives are\nand follow from the observations that\n\nLet formula_161 be a Cartesian coordinate system defined on the undeformed body and let formula_162 be another system defined on the deformed body. Let a curve formula_163 in the undeformed body be parametrized using formula_164. Its image in the deformed body is formula_165.\n\nThe undeformed length of the curve is given by\nAfter deformation, the length becomes\nNote that the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is defined as\nHence,\nwhich indicates that changes in length are characterized by formula_170.\n\nThe concept of \"strain\" is used to evaluate how much a given displacement differs locally from a rigid body displacement. One of such strains for large deformations is the \"Lagrangian finite strain tensor\", also called the \"Green-Lagrangian strain tensor\" or \"Green – St-Venant strain tensor\", defined as\n\nor as a function of the displacement gradient tensor\nor\n\nThe Green-Lagrangian strain tensor is a measure of how much formula_174 differs from formula_175.\n\nThe \"Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor\", referenced to the deformed configuration, i.e. Eulerian description, is defined as\n\nor as a function of the displacement gradients we have\n\nB. R. Seth from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur was the first to show that the Green and Almansi strain tensors are special cases of a more general strain measure. The idea was further expanded upon by Rodney Hill in 1968. The Seth–Hill family of strain measures (also called Doyle-Ericksen tensors) can be expressed as\n\nFor different values of formula_179 we have:\n\nThe second-order approximation of these tensors is\nwhere formula_182 is the infinitesimal strain tensor.\n\nMany other different definitions of tensors formula_183 are admissible, provided that they all satisfy the conditions that:\n\nAn example is the set of tensors \nwhich do not belong to the Seth–Hill class, but have the same 2nd-order approximation as the Seth–Hill measures at formula_191 for any value of formula_192.\n\nThe stretch ratio is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration.\n\nThe stretch ratio for the differential element formula_193 (Figure) in the direction of the unit vector formula_194 at the material point formula_16, in the undeformed configuration, is defined as\n\nwhere formula_197 is the deformed magnitude of the differential element formula_64.\n\nSimilarly, the stretch ratio for the differential element formula_199 (Figure), in the direction of the unit vector formula_200 at the material point formula_53, in the deformed configuration, is defined as\n\nThe normal strain formula_203 in any direction formula_194 can be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio,\n\nThis equation implies that the normal strain is zero, i.e. no deformation, when the stretch is equal to unity. Some materials, such as elastometers can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail, whereas traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios, perhaps of the order of 1.1 (reference?)\n\nThe diagonal components formula_206 of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to the normal strain, e.g.\n\nwhere formula_208 is the normal strain or engineering strain in the direction formula_209.\n\nThe off-diagonal components formula_206 of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to shear strain, e.g.\n\nwhere formula_212 is the change in the angle between two line elements that were originally perpendicular with directions formula_209 and formula_214, respectively.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, i.e. small displacements and small displacement rates, the components of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor may be approximated by the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor\n\nA representation of deformation tensors in curvilinear coordinates is useful for many problems in continuum mechanics such as nonlinear shell theories and large plastic deformations. Let formula_215 denote the function by which a position vector in space is constructed from coordinates formula_216. The coordinates are said to be \"convected\" if they correspond to a one-to-one mapping to and from Lagrangian particles in a continuum body. If the coordinate grid is \"painted\" on the body in its initial configuration, then this grid will deform and flow with the motion of material to remain painted on the same material particles in the deformed configuration so that grid lines intersect at the same material particle in either configuration. The tangent vector to the deformed coordinate grid line curve formula_217 at formula_218 is given by\nThe three tangent vectors at formula_218 form a local basis. These vectors are related the reciprocal basis vectors by \n\nLet us define a second-order tensor field formula_222 (also called the metric tensor) with components\nThe Christoffel symbols of the first kind can be expressed as\n\nTo see how the Christoffel symbols are related to the Right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor let us similarly define two bases, the already mentioned one that is tangent to deformed grid lines and another that is tangent to the undeformed grid lines. Namely,\n\nUsing the definition of the gradient of a vector field in curvilinear coordinates, the deformation gradient can be written as\n\nThe right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is given by\nIf we express formula_170 in terms of components with respect to the basis {formula_229} we have\nTherefore, \n\nand the corresponding Christoffel symbol of the first kind may be written in the following form.\n\nConsider a one-to-one mapping from formula_233 to formula_234 and let us assume that there exist two positive-definite, symmetric second-order tensor fields formula_235 and formula_222 that satisfy\nThen,\nNoting that\nand formula_240 we have\nDefine\nHence\nDefine\nThen\nDefine the Christoffel symbols of the second kind as\nThen\nTherefore,\nThe invertibility of the mapping implies that\nWe can also formulate a similar result in terms of derivatives with respect to formula_250. Therefore,\n\nThe problem of compatibility in continuum mechanics involves the determination of allowable single-valued continuous fields on bodies. These allowable conditions leave the body without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation. Most such conditions apply to simply-connected bodies. Additional conditions are required for the internal boundaries of multiply connected bodies.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible formula_252 field over a simply connected body are\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible formula_170 field over a simply connected body are\nWe can show these are the mixed components of the Riemann–Christoffel curvature tensor. Therefore, the necessary conditions for formula_170-compatibility are that the Riemann–Christoffel curvature of the deformation is zero.\n\nNo general sufficiency conditions are known for the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor in three-dimensions. Compatibility conditions for two-dimensional formula_257 fields have been found by Janet Blume.\n\n\n"}

Its colors are royal blue and white and the teams are called the Romans.\n\nLos Angeles High School is a public secondary high school, enrolling an estimated 2,000 students in grades 9–12. After operating on a year-round basis consisting of three tracks for ten years, it was restored to a traditional calendar in 2010. Los Angeles High School receives accreditation approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Concurrent enrollment programs, provided in large by the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Community College District, are offered with West Los Angeles College, Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles City College, or Santa Monica College.\n\nLos Angeles High School is a large, urban, inner-city school located in the Mid-Wilshire District of Los Angeles. The attendance boundary consists of a contrasting spectrum of economic diversity ranging from affluent Hancock Park and Lafayette Square to the low-income, densely populated immigrant community of Koreatown. Within the school is a College Incentive Magnet Program. Forty-four percent of the student population is identified as LEP, or Limited English Proficient. Currently, 66% of the students are identified as eligible to receive supplemental instructional services and materials through the Federal Title I Program.\n\nThe magnet high school has a university preparatory secondary high school program and a \"school within a school.\" First established as a part of student integration services in the 1970s, the Los Angeles High School Math/Science/Technology magnet prepares students with an intensive, rigorous course load in order to better prepare them for university entrance. There are 317 students enrolled in the magnet program, grades 9-12.\n\nTypically, the senior class has approximately 50% of seniors entering into four-year universities and schools. The magnet senior class typically has 90% of its senior class entering into four-year colleges and universities.\n\nEarly buildings commissioned to house the Los Angeles High School were among the architectural jewels of the city, and were strategically placed at the summit of a hill, the easier to be pointed to with pride. One of the school's long standing mottos is \"Always a hill, always a tower, always a timepiece.\"\n\nConstruction on Los Angeles' first public high school, (the Jesuit Loyola High School is older) began on July 19, 1872, at the former site of Central School on what was then known as Poundcake Hill, at the southeast corner of Fort Street (later Broadway), which the front of the school faced, and Temple Street, with the back of the school to New High Street (later Spring Street). The approximate coordinates are . As it was on the hill, a few hundred feet from the streets below, steep wooden stairways led up to the schoolyard.\n\nThe two-story wooden structure was so big and grand, the finest school south of San Francisco at that time, with classic lines and a tower with a clock in it, that people traveled from miles around to see it. The teachers liked the wide corridors, walnut banisters, generous windows and the transoms over the doors.\n\nThe schoolhouse was completed at a cost of $20,000 in 1873 (). Nearby, in succession, was the Court House, the City Hall, the Jones-Lindley Market and the Post Office. The first principal was Rev. Dr. William T. Lucky (1821–1876) and the first graduating class, in 1875, consisted of seven students. In 1879, a natural science club, the Star and Crescent Society, was founded at LAHS and consisted then of the entire student body. It soon left its specific focus on science and became a de facto student government and organizational body.\n\nIn 1887, the decision was made to move the high school building to Sand Street (later California Street, now part of the Hollywood Freeway), just to the west of North Hill Street and below the south side of Fort Moore Hill, in order for the Los Angeles County Courthouse to be built on Poundcake Hill. The contractor, Mr. Hickam, said he could do the job with scaffolding, rollers, horses and workmen. But his bid turned out to be too low. He lost a considerable amount of money because of his elaborate preparations, including the high wooden trestle which carried the building over the intersection of Temple and Fort Street. Hickam managed to get the schoolhouse halfway up Temple Street when he ran out of money and left it right in the middle of the street. It was there for a good while. They jacked it up on scaffolding high enough for the Temple Street street cars to run under it. Finally, they got it moved up to its new location on Sand Street, where LAHS students and faculty remained until the second high school was built a few years later.\nThe original schoolhouse remained at the Sand Street (California Street) site for many years, while in continuous use. After the high school moved out, it became a school for the lower grades. It went completely unharmed by the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, which did a lot of damage to the newer buildings in downtown. By April 1936, nearly 300 children attended school there.\n\nIn 1890, construction began on a new red brick schoolhouse facing North Hill Street on Fort Moore Hill, between Sand Street and Bellevue Avenue (later Sunset Boulevard, now Cesar Chavez Avenue), at coordinates , which was a short distance from the older wooden one then facing Sand Street below.\nThat same year, the Los Angeles City High School District was formed. It served students of LAHS while the Los Angeles City School District and various other elementary school districts served elementary and junior high school students.\n\nThis second location atop a hill was completed in 1891 and LAHS moved in. It was an enormous building for its time. The new high school was built on part of the site of the abandoned Fort Moore Hill Cemetery, the first Protestant cemetery in Los Angeles, which was spread over the slopes of the hill. It had become neglected, practically unattended and desecrated by grave robbing vandals. The Board of Education purchased the property from the city in 1884, and other portions of land were sold as residential lots. The city neglected to remove the remains and clear away the grave sites and some LAHS students in the 1890s thought it was \"fun\" to sit and eat their lunch while they leaned against a tombstone.\nAt a meeting regarding the improvement of the school grounds on June 4, 1896, the committee was directed to wait on the Board of Education the following Monday evening to secure the cooperation of the board in having dirt being taken from the Hill Street cut used in filling up the grounds of the high school, so that shrubbery could be grown about the building. LAHS was the only high school in Los Angeles until 1905.\nIn 1917, the school moved to its current location on Olympic Boulevard, and Rimpau, with 1,937 students. An edifice was erected that became an international cultural landmark for the famed school. To insure a permanently beautiful vista for their contemplation, and to honor classmates who had fallen in World War I, the students purchased the land across the street for the creation of a tree-filled memorial park.\nActual student government was instituted at LAHS in the early 1900s, eliminating one of the main reasons for Star and Crescent's existence. Meanwhile, as the size of the student body increased over years, the lower grades were successively dropped from Star and Crescent until by 1935 only seniors were members. Star and Crescent probably disappeared after World War II, but it is difficult to determine the exact year since no one at the school today can say when it ended. In particular, yearbooks were published during the years of America's involvement in that war, so it seems likely it might have disappeared after the war years. In the S'42 yearbook a page was devoted to Star and Crescent with its Officers and Faculty sponsors listed. The graduating class of 1970 received their Star & Crescent pins at a special ceremony.\n\nThe second high school, on Fort Moore Hill, eventually became a school for problem students, a lot of them truancy cases. By September 1948, when preparing for the school to be razed for the construction of the Hollywood Freeway, plans were made to transfer the students to Belmont High School, in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles. As Belmont students and parents protested the transfers, an alternative plan provided that 12 persons be assigned to the senior and junior high schools in the six attendance areas to carry out the program. The headquarters of the Board of Education was later built on the property. Most of Fort Moore Hill itself was removed in 1949 for the construction of the freeway, which opened in December 1950. Also located on what remains of the hill is the Fort Moore Pioneer Memorial, which was opened to the public in 1957.\n\nOn July 1, 1961, the Los Angeles City High School District and the elementary school districts were merged into the Los Angeles Unified School District. For many years, \"The Blue and White Daily\" was one of the few high school newspapers to be published Tuesday through Friday mornings during the school year except for holidays and the first 11 and last 5 days of the semester. It was a 4-page paper. In 1962, \"Daily\" was dropped from the name and the publication became a weekly. It is currently published monthly.\n\nLos Angeles High School is shown in the opening credits of the 1940s movie \"Strike Up The Band\". The popular late 1960s and early 1970s television series \"Room 222\" was filmed at LAHS. The 1917 building sustained moderate cosmetic damage, principally in the tower area, during the Sylmar earthquake in 1971. Efforts spearheaded by the Alumni Association, founded in 1876, to repair and preserve the iconic structure were opposed by certain commercial interests, who lobbied for its demolition, and finally decisively thwarted when it was gutted by a fire of mysterious origin. The replacement structure has been universally decried and finds no champions among either current or former students and faculty, or residents of the neighboring community.\n\nThe school population peaked at 10,800, but overcrowding at the school has been relieved by West Adams Preparatory High School, which opened in the 2007–2008 school year. In 2009, some territory of Los Angeles High School's attendance boundary was transferred to Fairfax High School.\n\nIn February 2012, a gunman shot at teens near the high school. Two were wounded.\n\nNeighborhoods zoned to LAHS include: Brookside, Harvard Heights, Koreatown, Lafayette Square, and Little Ethiopia;and portions of Hancock Park and the Pico-Union District. \n\nAs of 2001, 75% of the student body was Hispanic and Latino. 14% was black and 7% was Asian. Other ethnic groups made up the remainder.\n\nAs of 2001 the school has the only full-time Korean language classes in LAUSD. As of that year there were over 100 students in these classes, and 80% of them were not of Korean heritage.\n\nStudents are accepted into the Advanced Placement Program and individual advanced placement classes based on faculty and counselor recommendations. A student may be admitted into an AP class by request if the AP instructor has approved the request.\n\nThe focus of this program is the implementation of the LAUSD 2018 Master Plan for English Learners and Standard English Learners with fidelity, so that student achievement is realized. During 2018–2019 school year 19% of the total student enrollment are students identified as English Learners, and 23% are students classified as AEA Probable Standard English Learners. At LAHS all content teachers use ELD standards. The PLDs (proficiency level descriptors) represent English language development as a part of a continuum from native language competencies to lifelong language learning. The CA ELD Standards are organized in two main sections: Section 1 provides a foundation for an orientation to the standards; Section 2 provides detailed grade level ELD standards with the corresponding CCSS-ELA. The CA ELD Standards are not taught in isolation but are used in the context of developing meaningful, intellectual interaction. The role of the Title III Coach is to collaborate with school staff in building capacity to design and deliver professional development that utilizes and aligns standards-based content with effective classroom pedagogy to increase proficiency in the area of English language arts for all students through effective first teaching.\n\n\n\n"}

Owned by Stephens Media Group, it broadcasts an urban contemporary format. KGA's studios and offices are located on East 57th Avenue and its transmitter site is in Spangle, Washington. Going on the air in 1927, it was one of the earliest radio stations in Washington. It is also broadcast by a translator in Spokane on 103.5 FM.\n\nThe station carries broadcasts of the Spokane Indians minor league baseball team, the Spokane Chiefs junior ice hockey team, and teams fielded by Gonzaga University. \n\nKGA was first licensed on February 4, 1927, by original owner Louis Wasmer. KGA's first studios were in the old Radio Center Building across the street from the Davenport Hotel and its transmitter was on the northside of Spokane where the Lidgerwood Elementary School is now located. KGA was a successful country music outlet from 1969 until 1994, when it switched to a news/talk format. KGA's former owners also established a short lived, lower powered country music station based in Kirkland, Washington (near Seattle) called KGAA (now KARR). Also in the history of KGA were the Top 40 years, from January 1968 until June 1969, featuring disc jockeys Shane Showtime and Joe Fiala.\n\nFrom 1994 until 2008, KGA relied mostly on nationally syndicated talk shows from commentators such as Bill O'Reilly, Laura Ingraham and Michael Savage, along with several local programs. Former Los Angeles police detective and author Mark Fuhrman, who lives in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, hosted a local morning show on weekdays until his program was discontinued in November 2007. In April 2008, KGA's news/talk format moved to sister station 790 KJRB, with KJRB's sports format switched to KGA.\n\nAlthough KGA has had several owners (including Gonzaga University), has changed frequency several times, and has had its studio and transmitter site relocated over the years, it has retained the same set of call letters from its founding. The call sign KGA has been continuously used in Spokane longer than any other set of call letters.\n\nKGA was a 50,000 watt clear-channel Class A station for most of its life, and could be heard after sunset around the Pacific Northwest, plus part of Western Canada. On July 15, 2008, KGA reduced its nighttime power from 50,000 watts to 15,000 watts, surrendered its status as a Class A to Class B, and changed its directional antenna system.. Class A stations have the widest coverage areas and best protection from interference from other stations. All of this was done so that its sister station, KSFN in Piedmont, California, could increase its nighttime power from 230 watts to 2,400 watts. The justification for this change was gaining several hundred thousand potential listeners in the San Francisco Bay Area while sacrificing KGA's smaller potential audience in the Pacific Northwest. The station currently has a construction permit to simplify its antenna system to a single tower with non-directional operation (FCC.gov AM Station Query). Included is a further nighttime power reduction, to 540 watts, with a slight power reduction just after sunrise and just before sunset critical hours to 45,000 watts. \n\nIn January 2019, after adding a new FM translator in Spokane on 103.5 FM, the station flipped from Fox Sports Radio to an urban contemporary format branded as \"103.5 The Game\". Positioned as \"Sports & Hip-Hop\", the station retains its existing play-by-play rights, with the remainder of its schedule now focusing on hip-hop music.\n\nIn October 2019, the station was sold to Stephens Media Group after it acquired most of the properties of former owner Mapleton Communications.\n\n1.

He wrote three early novels, published by the Vanguard Press — \"Summer in Williamsburg\" (1934), \"Homage to Blenholt\" (1936), and \"Low Company\" (1937). The earlier two of these depicted Jewish life in Williamsburg; the last focused on various ethnic types in Brighton Beach. A single-volume edition of these was published by Basic Books in 1965 under the title \"Three Novels.\" Subsequent one-volume editions include \"The Brooklyn Novels,\" with an introduction by the novelist Jonathan Lethem, published in 2006 by Black Sparrow Books, an imprint of David R. Godine, Publisher.\n\n\"Homage to Blenholt\" concerns a well-meaning tenement \"schlemiel\" who hopes to escape poverty via various inventions and get-rich quick schemes. Fuchs also wrote short stories and personal essays, mainly for \"The New Yorker\". When he was 26, he moved to Los Angeles, California to work on films.\n\nFuchs wrote the screenplay for the crime noir \"Criss Cross\" (1949). He also penned the psychodrama \"Panic in the Streets\" (1950), which was directed by Elia Kazan.

It was based on the children's television series \"Barney & Friends\". Educational concepts taught in the game include counting, matching, and problem solving. There is a self-play feature that guides the player to the objective when he or she is not playing.\n\nThe voice of Barney was recorded by Bob West, who also did it on the television show. There are more than one hundred words and two hundred phrases spoken by Barney the Dinosaur.\n\nIn this game, the objective is to move Barney around four themed levels and locate five children and five presents that are hiding throughout the level. Should the player find all the children and presents in different levels, they would be rewarded with a \"special surprise\". During the surprise, the purple balloons are popped while confetti and streamers are drizzled in the presence of excited children in addition to Barney and Baby Bop. Players are unable to lose in the game, even if they did not retrieve all the objects and find all the missing children in the level.\n\nWhen nowhere near an object to interact with, Barney can blow kisses in the air complete with flying heart symbols. Locating a child results in giving him or her a hug. Barney can even fly on balloons, float on clouds, and jump on nearby platforms. The inability for Barney to die is indicated by him refusing to fall off floating platforms; instead there is a safety lecture handed out by Barney so kids can learn to be careful like him. Cloud jumping is only possible when the traffic light is showing a green signal.\n\nFavorite things are always mentioned by name by Barney when the player helps him discover them. Most of the lines for the game were recorded with the nouns and verbs being fractured; resulting in one-second pauses between non-crucial words and words crucial to gameplay.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews based on its very simplistic gameplay. Brett Alan Weiss, of Allgame, gave it a rating of 4/5, stating that the game was \"perfeclty suited\" for its target audience. On the other hand, Vince Thornburg, of Sega-16, stated that the game \"did its purpose of being a simple game for kids, and that’s about it.\"\n\nThe game received attention from the speedrunning community due to its unique self-playing feature. Put simply, the game will beat itself even if given no input by the player, however some elements of randomness make it so it won't take the same time on every playthrough. This prompted the creation of a speedrunning category called \"Any% No Controller\", in which players do not touch the controller, and instead wait for the game to play itself to completion.

He left that group in 1993 to form his own band, Polo Urías y su Maquina Norteña. Some of his most popular hits are \"Veinte Años\", \"Una Aventura\", and \"Mi Primer Amor\".\n\nUrías was born in the state of Chihuahua, near the border town of Ojinaga. Urías recalls that when he was very young he would often sing while plowing in the fields with his mules, without any accordions, guitars, or musical instruments. Later, he became a railroad worker.\n\nHis first professional work came when he joined Los Jilgueros Del Arroyo.\n\nAlthough his band is currently based in Hobbs, New Mexico, USA, the city of Ojinaga has officially honored him for his contributions to norteño music. He has also impacted the city of Odessa, Texas leading the mayor of the city, Larry Melton, to honor him with the key to the city and marking every 15 November as \"Polo Urias Day\". \"It's a great honor,\" the singer says, because he knows the people of Odessa have watched him grow.\n\nToday, his band Polo Urías y su Maquina Norteña (\"Polo Urías and his Engine of the North\"), is very popular on regional Mexican radio in both the United States and Mexico.\n\n\nPolo Urías has eleven siblings, many of whom are also members of norteño-sax bands. He is the uncle of Adolfo Urías, another norteño-sax singer. His latest release \"Y sigue la maquina dando\" featuring the hit single \"Porque Volviste\" was a hit in the U.S.\n\nIn 2007, he bought a tour bus valued at over $250,000 after his original bus was burned in 2006. All members of the band were on board, and asleep at the time of the incident, but somehow managed to escape unharmed thanks to a motorist who flagged the bus driver, Jose \"Joe\" Luis Avila, down.\n\n\n"}

It was closely related to the Guernésiais (Guernsey), Jèrriais (Jersey), and Sercquiais (Sark) dialects of the neighbouring islands, as well as continental Norman on the European mainland.\n\nThe dialect became extinct in the 20th century. Only a few examples of Auregnais survive, mostly in place names in Alderney, and one audio recording is known to exist.\n\nThe last known native speaker of Auregnais died around 1960. Linguist Frank Le Maistre, author of the \"Dictionnaire Jersiais-Français\", recorded the only known audio samples of the language, which he published in 1982.\n\nOne reason for the extinction of the language was movement of the population. In particular, the influx of labourers from the United Kingdom employed by the British government in the construction of the abortive harbour project and other fortifications (during the reign of Queen Victoria), as well as the stationing of a sizable British garrison among the small population, served to relegate Auregnais to a lesser status for communication. The evacuation of nearly all indigenous Auregnais to the British mainland during World War II (the island was occupied by the Wehrmacht) was thought to be a major factor in the final loss of the spoken language.\n\nAnother reason for the language's demise was official neglect, especially in the education sector, where it was not taught at all. This led to a situation in which, as was noted by the Guernsey newspaper \"Le Bailliage\" in 1880, children had ceased to speak the language among themselves – partly due to teachers discouraging its use in favour of standard French. However, along with the decline in Auregnais went the decline in the use of French. French ceased to be an official language in the island in 1966. The official French used in the Channel Islands (see Jersey Legal French) differs slightly from Metropolitan French and greatly from the vernacular Norman.\n\nTraces of the language still exist in many, if not most, local placenames. Many of these have been gallicised, but some notable examples include Ortac (Or'tac), Burhou (with the \"-hou\" suffix) and the first element of the name \"\"Braye\" Harbour\".\n\nOne or two words linger on in the local English, e.g. \"vraic\" (seaweed fertiliser – a word common throughout the Channel Islands), and the pronunciation of certain local surnames, e.g. Dupont and Simon as and rather than the standard Parisian pronunciation. A few older people can still remember it being spoken, and know a word or two.\n\nUnusually, for such a small dialect, Auregnais used to have an exclave or \"colony\" of speakers on Les Casquets for a number of years. Algernon Charles Swinburne based his poem \"Les Casquets\" on the Houguez family who actually lived on the islands for 18 years. The Houguez family came from Alderney, and the evidence points to its members being Auregnais speakers; in fact, the daughter married a man from Alderney. During this time, they were isolated and would have had few visitors, but would have spoken Auregnais most of the time.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2210835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210835", "title": "Attentional blink", "text": "Attentional blink\n\nAttentional blink (AB) is a phenomenon that reflects the temporal costs in allocating selective attention. A second target is often not perceived when presented in close succession of a first target.\nThe AB is typically measured by using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, where participants often fail to detect a second salient target if it is presented between 200-500 ms after the first one. The AB has also been observed using two backward-masked targets and auditory stimuli. The term attentional blink was first used in 1992, although the phenomenon was probably known before.\nThe precise adaptive significance behind the attentional blink is unknown, but it is thought to be a product of a two-stage visual processing system attempting to allocate episodic context to targets. In this two-stage system, all stimuli are processed to some extent by an initial parallel stage, and only salient ones are selected for in-depth processing, in order to make optimum use of limited resources at a late serial stage.\n\nOne curious aspect of the attentional blink is that it usually includes \"lag 1 sparing\", meaning that targets presented \"very\" close together in time (at \"lag 1\" or consecutively in the RSVP stream) are not affected by the attentional blink, even though items presented at slightly greater lags are significantly impaired. In an attentional blink study done by Visser et al., participants frequently had trouble reporting multiple targets that were presented within 200ms-500ms of each other, and were only able to report one accurately (2015) . These targets are denoted as T1, T2, etc. The phenomena lag-1 sparing refers to the performance of T2 as opposed to what precedes it, T1. T2 performance was originally hypothesized to be reported far less often and less accurately by participants than T1, because the attention of the participant would still be on T1 while T2 was presented immediately afterwards. Visser also thought that the participants would be too focused on finding the first target that they would miss the second target completely. However, participants actually did better identifying T2 than they were at identifying T1 when the targets were separated by one or two distractors, denoted also as lags.\n\nA possible explanation for lag-1 sparing is that this phenomenon is heavily interconnected with attentional blink, but does not operate on the same cognitive mechanisms and requires different stimuli to occur. Specifically, for lag-1 sparing to occur, it needs visual input as practice targets. These targets can be numbers or letters presented in rapid succession. When the first target, T1, is presented, it creates an attentional window because of its novelty, meaning that it attracts and holds more attention by the participant. The novelty that wears off between T1 and T2 creates a “boost” in attention and opens a metaphorical window for faster cognition. Participants now know what and how to look for targets, so they find targets more quickly. This attentional widow remains open long enough for T2 to be presented and processed at a much higher rate because of shared characteristics to T1. Targets are normally presented in less than .5 of a second from each other. Lag-1 sparing also occurred regardless of how information was visually presented. Of two RSVP streams— where T1 location was known in the first stream and unknown in the second stream, lag-1 sparing occurred whether T2 was in the same stream as T1, or in a different stream than T1.\n\nThere is as yet no conclusive explanation for the phenomenon of lag 1 sparing, although it is thought to be related to the first parallel stage of the two-stage system of stimulus selection and processing.\n\nAccording to the LC-NE hypothesis, when a salient, or meaningful stimulus is presented, neurons in the locus coeruleus release norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that benefits the detection of the stimulus. The effect of this release lasts for 100 ms after the salient stimulus is presented and benefits the second target when presented immediately after the first one, accounting for lag 1 sparing. Eventually the neurons in the locus coeruleus enter a refractory period, due to the auto-inhibitory effect of norepinephrine. According to the hypothesis, targets presented during this refractory period cannot trigger a release of norepinephrine, resulting in the attentional blink. The episodic distinctiveness hypothesis of the ST2 model suggests that the attentional blink reflects a limitation of the visual system attempting to allocate unique episodic contexts to the ephemeral target stimuli presented in RSVP.\n\nThe attentional blink can be moderated by changes in visual similarity between targets and distractor stimuli, but it can also be affected by \"conceptual\" similarities, suggesting that stimuli are processed to quite a deep level preconsciously, with much of the resulting information discarded before it reaches consciousness.\n\nThe attentional blink is related to, but distinct from the phenomenon of repetition blindness.\n\nAttentional Blink can be used in other studies and experiments as a way to measure attention. A study conducted by Morrison et al. 2015 used AB to measure attentional differences in people with mental disorders such as depression and social anxiety disorder. Measuring AB in the subjects was effective in showing that subjects with those disorders have more difficulty recognizing T2 than others. Another study used the magnitude of AB in order to see whether positive moods affected temporal attention.\n\nWhen AB is tested, most often the stimuli presented are inanimate objects. But research shows that not only do inanimate stimuli effect AB but human faces do as well. Despite the hypothesis that configural and featural information are processed by separate channels, thus avoiding AB, human faces in all different configurations, are still processed and affected by AB.\n\nAn important factor which influences the AB is the role of emotions. Research has shown that when the second target (T2) in RSVP is an emotionally relevant stimulus it is more likely to be perceived during the attentional blink. The attentional blink is not only modulated by emotional relevance of (T2) but also by the emotional relevance of (T1). In short: when (T1) is emotionally relevant the AB is lengthened, when (T2) is emotionally relevant then the AB is reduced. This research suggests that emotion mediates attention.\n\nThe sex of the stimuli presented also influences the AB. In a study, it was shown that emotions that are more often than not prescribed to different sexes, were more quickly identified. Not only that, but when the attentional blink would occur, whether it be at lag 1 or lag 2, and how deep of a blink it was, could be manipulated by the sex of and the emotion expressed by T1.\n\nThere have also been studies using images as emotional stimuli. Emotionally negative pictures preceding the target by 2 items were found to induce greater deficits in processing the target stimuli than neutral pictures did. Thus, it seems that emotional information can elicit attentional biases which temporarily prevent awareness of actively sought out stimuli.\n\nA study conducted by Heleen Slagter, Richard Davidson and colleagues, suggests that vipassana meditation may particularly reduce the duration of attentional blink. Vipassana Meditation is done by practitioners that focus on their cognitive processes, but do not think of the thoughts associated with them. With this in mind, Vipassana Meditation may be considered an exercise in attention. In an experiment, 17 people received three months of intensive training in meditation. Those 17 along with 23 meditation novices performed an attention task in which they successively picked out two numbers embedded in a series of letters. The novices exhibited attentional blink and missed the second number. In contrast, all the trained meditators consistently picked out both numbers. This indicated meditation practice can improve focus.\n\nHowever, not all kinds of meditation can shorten the attentional blink, necessarily. Another kind of meditation is called Metta Meditation, where the practitioner thinks about a loved one and focuses on the love they feel for them. They focus on the emotions focused on wishing that person well. This kind of meditation increases positive feelings within people and rids the negative ones. An experiment was done by Lutz and company. They compared those who did Metta Meditation with those who engaged in basic relaxation. They found that there was not a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nRaymond et al. (1992) suggest that the attentional blink is produced by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They suggest that this confusion happens at some point in the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn't observed. The researchers also suggested that one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.\n\nShapiro et al. (1994) suggest that an interference model may better explain the attentional blink effects than the inhibition model. In this model, the attentional blink is thought to take place because of an out of place item which is selected out of the series because of the interference within the items in the series. Shapiro proposes that the amount of interference increases or decreases with the length of the series.\n\nGiesbrecht and Di Lollo (1998) suggest that the attentional blink over target 2 results when the person is busy processing target 1. It is suggested that anything increasing the difficulty of processing of the first target will result in a greater attentional blink.\n\nDuncan et al. (1996) suggest that the target 1 takes over parts of our attentional capacity, leading to a deficit of processing or recognizing target 2 when presented immediately after target 1. This theory suggests that the time for which target 1 continues to occupy attentional capacity is related directly to the difficulty of processing target 2.\n\nChun & Potter (1995) suggest that quickly processing a series of items requires two back to back stages. The first stage is the initial rapid-detection. Here, the possible targets are noticed. The second stage is the capacity-limited in which items are taken in order to report later. Stage 2 occurs after the acknowledgement of targets in Stage 1. Here, stage 2 must finishing processing target 1, until then, target 2 will not be recognized in stage 2. If there is a situation where the second target comes in the first stage, the highway to stage two is delayed. Attentional blinking occurs when the second target is in stage 1 which causes a delay. The attentional blink mirror a restriction in the process of combining information from an unstable representation to a stable representation (Johnson & Proctor, 2004).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210837", "title": "Anti-Federalist Papers", "text": "Anti-Federalist Papers\n\nThe Anti-Federalist Papers is the collective name given to works written by the Founding Fathers who were opposed to or concerned with the merits of the United States Constitution of 1787. Starting on 25 September 1787 (8 days after the final draft of the US Constitution) and running through the early 1790s, these anti-Federalists published a series of essays arguing against a stronger and more energetic union as embodied in the new Constitution. Although less influential than their counterparts, \"The Federalist Papers\", these works nonetheless played an important role in shaping the early American political landscape and in the passage of the US Bill of Rights.\n\nFollowing its victory against the British in the Revolutionary War, the United States was plagued by a variety of internal problems. The weak central government could not raise taxes to cover war debts and was largely unable to pass legislation. Many early American politicians and thinkers believed that these issues were the result of the Articles of Confederation, the first governing document of the United States. In 1787 a convention gathered in Philadelphia to attempt to amend it. Soon, however, the gathering shifted its focus to constructing a newer and more powerful Constitution for the fledgling country. Two main competing factions emerged, the Federalists and the anti-Federalists. The former supported a more powerful central government while the latter opposed it.\n\nDuring the lengthy and heated national debate following this convention, both groups wrote extensively in favor of their respective positions. The anti-Federalist papers are a selection of the written arguments against the US Constitution by those known to posterity as the anti-Federalists. As with the Federalist papers, these essays were originally published in newspapers. The most widely known are \"a series of sixteen essays published in the New York Journal from October 1787 through April 1788 during the same period. The anti-Federalist was appearing in New York newspapers, under the pseudonym 'Brutus'.\"\n\nThe Anti-Federalist papers were written over a number of years and by a variety of authors who utilized pen names to remain anonymous, and debates over authorship continue to this day. Unlike the authors of \"The Federalist Papers\", a group of three men working closely together, the authors of the anti-Federalist papers were not engaged in an organized project. Thus, in contrast to the pro-Constitution advocates, there was no one book or collection of anti-Federalist Papers at the time. The essays were the product of a vast number of authors, working individually rather than as a group. Although there is no canonical list of anti-federalist authors, major authors include Cato (likely George Clinton), Brutus (likely Melancton Smith or Robert Yates or perhaps John Williams), Centinel (Samuel Bryan), and the Federal Farmer (either Melancton Smith, Richard Henry Lee, or Mercy Otis Warren). Works by Patrick Henry and a variety of others are often included as well.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, there was no united series of anti-Federalist papers. The first major collection was compiled by Morton Borden, a professor at Columbia University, in 1965. He \"collected 85 of the most significant papers and arranged them in an order closely resembling that of the 85 Federalist Papers\". The most frequently cited contemporary collection, The Complete Anti-Federalist, was compiled by Herbert Storing and Murray Dry of the University of Chicago. At seven volumes and including many pamphlets and other materials not previously published in a collection, this work is considered, by many, to be the authoritative compendium on the publications.\n\nConsidering their number and diversity, it is difficult to summarize the contents of the Anti-Federalist papers. Generally speaking they reflected the sentiments of the anti-Federalists, which Akhil Reed Amar of the Yale Law School generalized as: a localist fear of a powerful central government, a belief in the necessity of direct citizen participation in democracy, and a distrust of wealthy merchants and industrialists. Essays with titles such as \"A Dangerous Plan of Benefit Only to The 'Aristocratick Combination and \"New Constitution Creates a National Government; Will Not Abate Foreign Influence; Dangers of Civil War And Despotism\" fill the collection, and reflect the strong feelings of the authors.\n\nIn the table below, a selection of Anti-Federalist papers have been contrasted with their Federalist counterparts.\nThe Anti-Federalists proved unable to stop the ratification of the US Constitution, which took effect in 1789. Since then, the essays they wrote have largely fallen into obscurity. Unlike, for example, The Federalist No. 10 written by James Madison, none of their works are mainstays in college curricula or court rulings. The influence of their writing, however, can be seen to this day – particularly in the nature and shape of the United States Bill of Rights. Federalists (such as Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 84) vigorously argued against its passage but were in the end forced to compromise. The broader legacy of the Anti-Federalist cause can be seen in the strong suspicion of centralized government held by many Americans to this day.\n\n\n"}

It has become an important route for both commuters and agriculture through Washington County. Oregon Route 210 is signed from east-to-west; though in actuality it runs in a northeast-to-southwest direction.\n\nThe neighborhoods located along Route 210 are generally affluent, being higher in rent than 83.1% of the neighborhoods in Oregon.\n\nOregon Route 210's western terminus is at the junction with Oregon Route 219 in the town of Scholls. The highway leaves Scholls headed due north-northeast (on a 2-lane, unlimited-access alignment), crossing the Tualatin River over a bridge which replaced the historic Scholls Ferry (for which the road is still named). Soon after, there is a roundabout with River Road; with Oregon Route 210 heading east, and River Road heading towards Hillsboro to the west. Continuing east, the road winds through farmland (as well as a few wineries) in the fertile Tualatin Valley for several miles until the town of Kinton, and then toward its intersection with Roy Rogers Road.\n\nNear the intersection with Roy Rogers Road (named for a Washington County official, not for the famous cowboy) which heads south towards Sherwood, Oregon Route 210 enters Portland's Urban Growth Boundary, and the farms and wineries are suddenly replaced with townhouses and subdivisions, and OR 210 transforms instantly into a suburban thoroughfare. A short distance further east, the highway passes on the edge of the Murrayhill neighborhood of Beaverton and becomes a four-lane divided expressway (one which is frequently clogged with rush-hour traffic). At this point, Oregon Route 210 becomes the boundary between Beaverton and the city of Tigard, with Beaverton to the north and Tigard to the south.\n\nThe highway continues east for several more miles in this fashion until its intersection with Oregon Route 217, a freeway serving Portland's southwestern suburbs. This intersection is frequently congested, as most traffic leaves OR 210 to get on OR 217 (generally heading north towards downtown Beaverton and Portland). Also nearby is the community of Progress and the Washington Square shopping mall, as well as Hall Boulevard, a major thoroughfare through Beaverton and Tigard.\n\nNorth of Hall Boulevard, the road once again becomes a two-lane route as it ambles through several neighborhoods in unincorporated Washington County. It heads in a north-northeasterly direction until it reaches the Raleigh Hills neighborhood, where Oregon Route 210 ends at an intersection with Oregon Route 10, the Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway. Scholls Ferry Road continues in a northeasterly direction for several more miles until it intersects with Oregon Route 8 and U.S. Route 26 in the Sylvan neighborhood. This stretch used to be signed as Oregon Route 210 as well; but that designation was removed some years ago.\n\nThere are two other notable alignment changes over the years. In the segment between Raleigh Hills and Progress one can find a residential street called \"Old Scholls Ferry Road\"; this was an older alignment of the highway. South of the Murrayhill neighborhood is a street called Barrows Road; this also was an old alignment of OR 210 before the new alignment through Murrayhill was constructed in the late 80s or early 90s. (For a while after the new roadway was built, Barrows Road continued to be signed as 210; however it no longer carries this designation). The current alignment, which goes over a hill, was actually the original alignment of the highway; sometime before 1960 the highway was rerouted to a longer but more level route along what is now called Barrows Road. At that time the \"new\" level route became Scholls Ferry Road, signed as OR 210, and the original route was renamed Old Scholls Ferry Road. In the 1990s Old Scholls Ferry Road regained its designation as OR 210 and the Barrows Road name was applied to the former route.\n\n"}

{"id": "2210844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210844", "title": "Washington Street Elevated", "text": "Washington Street Elevated\n\nThe Washington Street Elevated was an elevated segment of Boston's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway system, comprising the southern stretch of the Orange Line. It ran from Chinatown through the South End and Roxbury, ending in Forest Hills in Jamaica Plain, Boston.\n\nThe initial section of the Main Line Elevated opened on June 10, 1901, running from Sullivan Square in Charlestown over the Charlestown Elevated, through the Canal Street Incline into the Tremont Street subway, and out the Pleasant Street portal onto the Washington Street Elevated. The initial section of the elevated ran only to Dudley Square, with intermediate stations at Dover and Northampton. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated opened on August 22 of that year, joining the Washington Street El at Tower D Junction.\n\nThe El, Boston's first heavy rail metro line, proved extremely popular. The Washington Street Tunnel was opened on November 30, 1908, providing a separate route for the Main Line and allowing use of the Tremont Street subway for through streetcars. The southern portal of the tunnel connected with the Elevated at Tower D. The Elevated was extended south to Forest Hills on November 22, 1909, with an intermediate station at Egleston to transfer passengers from streetcars serving Roxbury and Dorchester. Although the Elevated was built primarily to replace radial streetcar lines running to downtown, ridership from the areas surrounding the stations proved high, and an infill station at Green Street with fewer streetcar connections was opened on September 22, 1912.\n\nThe Washington Street Elevated was the last elevated section of the Orange Line to remain standing. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated ended service in 1938, while the Charlestown Elevated was replaced with the largely surface-level Haymarket North Extension in 1975.\n\nBy the 1980s, however, the Elevated was showing its age. The steel uprights had lost a substantial portion of their mass to rusting, though it was not structurally unsound since it was heavily overbuilt, and a $3 million repainting in 1975 stopped further oxidation. \n\nFrom 1979 to 1987, the four-track railroad embankment between Back Bay and Forest Hills, originally acquired for a cancelled highway project, was converted to a trench with three mainline tracks and two rapid transit tracks as the Southwest Corridor project. Addition of rapid transit to the corridor had been proposed as a branch of the predecessor BERy's streetcar network in 1926, and as a relocation of the Orange Line since 1966. The last service over the Washington Street Elevated ran on April 30, 1987; service began over the Southwest Corridor route on May 4. The Elevated was removed soon after; some of the steel was later used for a new bridge carrying Arizona Route 188 over Theodore Roosevelt Lake.\n\nThe closing of the Washington Street Elevated prompted a 2012 review, the \"Roxbury-Dorcester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study\", recommended for some form of proposed replacement rail service to access southern Metro Boston neighborhoods - one option being studied within this review would re-use the Tremont Street subway's now-unused southern Pleasant Street tunnel coming from the Green Line's Boylston station. The proposed new light rail service proposed in the 2012 review, to replace the rapid transit access the Elevated previously provided, could go as far south as the Red Line's Mattapan station, with a northern turnaround terminus at Government Center.\n\nSince the Southwest Corridor was located somewhat further to the west than the Elevated had been, away from neighborhood centers like Dudley and Egleston Squares, the MBTA promised that a branch of the light rail Green Line would be built to provide continued rapid transit service to those areas. However, such service was not forthcoming; instead, the #49 Northampton – Washington & Kneeland feeder bus route was extended to Dudley Square and given a more direct routing.\n\nIn 2002, the MBTA deployed bus rapid transit along much of the route from Dudley Square to Downtown Crossing in the form of Phase I of the controversial Silver Line, replacing the #49. Although branded as bus rapid transit, the Washington Street section of the Silver Line is generally considered short of the international BRT Standard, as it lacks bus rapid transit elements such as dedicated bus lanes and pre-pay stations. The Silver Line has also been subject to neighborhood criticism, as it makes fewer stops than the #49, but nevertheless fails to sufficiently decrease travel times as compared to the previous conventional bus service.\n\nThe 2003 \"Program for Mass Transportation\" considered the possibility of converting the Washington Street section of the Silver Line to light rail, as had originally been promised, by using the abandoned Pleasant Street Incline and the currently-unused southern segment of the Tremont Street subway to connect with the Green Line at station. However, the Phase III tunnel and continued bus service was recommended instead. In 2012, the aforementioned Roxbury-Dorcester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study recommended, as a long-term project, the light rail conversion of the Silver Line's Washington Street section and its connection to the Green Line via the abandoned tunnel with a northern terminus/turnaround for the new line at Government Center; with the additional possibility of extending the line down Blue Hill Avenue to station (and thus connecting with the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line, and, indirectly, with the Red Line), following the route currently taken by the #28 bus.\n\nThe Washington Street Elevated consisted of six stations, the most complex and major of which were at Dudley Square and Forest Hills. Most of the original stations were designed by architect Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr., and originally featured much in the way of ornamentation and architectural prowess. By the time the \"El\" closed, however, much of this detail had been lost to decades of decay, neglect, and cost-cutting. Forest Hills Station was designed by Edmund March Wheelwright and was quite different from the other stations along the line, featuring a square stone exterior rather than sloping rooflines.\n\nFollowing the closure of the Elevated, most of the stations were scrapped; however, the Northampton station headhouse was moved to the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine in 1988, where it remains today, and parts of Dudley station were saved and incorporated into the current bus station.\n\nThe stations themselves were:\n\n"}

{"id": "2210854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210854", "title": "Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)", "text": "Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)\n\nThe Fighting machine (also known as \"Tripod\") is one of the fictional machines used by the Martians in H.G. Wells' 1898 classic science fiction novel \"The War of the Worlds\". It is a fast-moving, three-legged walker, reported to be 100 feet tall, with multiple whip-like tentacles used for grasping, and two lethal weapons: the heat-ray and a gun-like tube used for discharging canisters of a poisonous chemical black smoke that kills humans and animals. It is the primary machine the Martians use when they invade Earth, along with the handling machine, the flying machine, and the embankment machine.\nThe fighting machines walk on three tall, articulated legs and have a grouping of long, whip-like metallic tentacles hanging beneath the central body, a single flexible appendage holding the heat-ray projector, and atop the main body a brazen hood-like head that houses a sole Martian operator. H. G. Wells first describes the fighting machines in detail in Chapter 10:\n\nAnother eyewitness described the fighting machines as \"Boilers on stilts, I tell you, striding along like men\".\n\nA London newspaper article in the novel inaccurately described the fighting machines as \"spider-like machines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express-train, and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat\". Ironically, earlier newspaper articles under-exaggerated the Martians as being \"sluggard creatures\". The main character witnessed the fighting machines moving \"with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds\".\n\nThe fighting machines are armed with a heat-ray, which is fired by a camera-like device held by an articulated arm, and a chemical weapon known as \"the black smoke\", a poison gas which is deployed from gun tubes, not unlike a soldier's bazooka. The fighting machines can also discharge steam through nozzles that dissipates the black smoke, which then settles as an inert, powdery substance.\n\nThe metallic tentacles, which hang below the main fighting machine body, are used as probes and to grasp objects. These machines sometimes also carry a metal cage or basket which is used to hold human captives so the Martians can later revitalize themselves by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supplies by using pipettes. The height of the fighting machines is unclear; a newspaper article describes them to be more than tall. But they are also observed wading through relatively deep sea water. HMS \"Thunder Child\", a Royal Navy torpedo ram, engages a trio of tripods that are pursuing a refugee flotilla heading to France from the southeast English coast; the \"Thunder Child\" is eventually destroyed by the Martian heat-ray, but not before taking out two fighting machines.\n\nIn the novel the fighting machines crash-land to Earth in massive cylinders, shot from a sort of gun from Mars (in the PC game adaptation as well as the live musical version, the Martians refer to this device as a \"large-scale hydrogen accelerator\"). Once they arrive on Earth, the fighting machines are quickly assembled. A London newspaper article cites unnamed authorities who believed, based on the outside dimensions of the cylinders, they carried no more than five tripods per cylinder.\n\nThe original conceptual drawings for the fighting machines, drawn by Warwick Goble, accompanied the initial appearance of \"The War of the Worlds\" in \"Pearson's Magazine\" in 1897. When Wells saw these pictures, he was so displeased that he added the following text for the novel's hardcover appearance:\n\nThe Martian fighting machines designed by Albert Nozaki for George Pal's 1953 Paramount film \"The War of the Worlds\" barely resemble the same machines in the H. G. Wells novel. The novel's fighting machines are 10-story tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the machine's main body. In the film each fighting machine is armed with a visible, reddish heat-ray, atop a moving goose-neck, mounted in a cobra-like head.\n\nThe film's fighting machines are shaped like copper-colored manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. The lead character, Dr. Clayton Forrester, states they glide along on three electromagnetic legs (similar to the magnetic levitation employed by Japanese bullet trains). These legs are visible only when the Martian machines emerge from the pit made by their crash-landing, and are shown later, indirectly, by the faint tracings of a sparking, burning effect where the near-invisible legs touch the ground.\n\nThe machines also have weapons which fire green energy bursts from both wingtips. These are identified as \"skeleton beams\" for the ghastly visual effect, in which an x-ray-like silhouette of the victim's skeleton becomes briefly visible as the body disintegrates. They are immediately hypothesized by Dr. Forrester as neutralizing mesons, \"the atomic glue holding matter together\", causing the target to vaporize, leaving a black stain on the ground (either remnants of the burned bodies or a scorching of the terrain where they were standing). The weapon appears deployed as a long-range surface weapon, as compared to the heat-ray which is used at closer range and against taller structures or overhead aircraft. As they advance, \"... they slash across country like scythes, wiping out everything that's trying to get away from them\".\n\nThe fighting machines are also equipped with a retractable cable tipped with an electronic eye housing, which has three colored lenses (red, green, and blue). It is used as a probe and slightly resembles the Martian \"face\" located on their upper torsos. It is deployed from a round hatch on the underside of the machine, which appears seamless at any other time. The use of this probe and a subsequent physical reconnoiter (and contact) by a single Martian is the only time the Martians display any interest in humans.\n\nThe novel's fighting machines had no protection except for a fast moving offense and were therefore vulnerable to British Army artillery fire and a Navy torpedo ram. The film's machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield, identified by Dr. Forrester as a \"protective blister\", resembles, when briefly visible, the glass jar placed over mantle clocks: cylindrical and with a hemispherical top, which protects each of the fighting machines from heavy ground fire. Therefore, the film's machines are invincible to all standard Earth weapons, including an atomic bomb.\n\nThe serialized \"War of the Worlds\" (1988–89) television series was established as a sequel to the 1953 film with many of the alien technology in the first season cued with visual references to the design of those in the aforementioned film.\n\nWhile almost never using fighting machines in general, the series does reveal in one episode that these same aliens (from Mor-Tax; not Mars) did at one point use tripod machines in their past before evolving into the floating machines as seen in the film. This \"older model\" resembles the latter machines with only a few noticeable differences.\n\nAside from the legs, there is no visible mounted heat-ray, however, where the latter models have a green window along its front edge, the fighting machines have an orange/red colored window (framed in blue circle) coupled with its pulsating glow, suggesting a cruder version of their heat-ray built into the body of the machine. Whether it is a heat-ray or other weapon this model possesses is unknown. While the new models are reminiscent of a swan, these tripods seem more inspired by an insect, both in its (briefly seen) movement, as well as the sound it emits. The TV series also gives insight into the machines, referred to both by humans and aliens alike as ships. In \"The Resurrection\" the interior of the machines are seen to be lit by cold colors of blue and black (with only a sliver of neon green). The machines have an on-board computer that the aliens can communicate with even when distanced by location and time, and even with relatively primitive equipment\n\nWhen asked how the aliens make the machines fly, Dr. Blackwood refers to Dr. Forrester's unconfirmed speculation that they are able to use brainwave impulses. This is given credibility when three aliens later take possession of the tripod. From inside, it can be seen that there is no obvious physical means of operation; instead, the three are simply seated back-to-back, a formation seen quite commonly among the aliens throughout the season, frequently in a state of some type of shared mental exercise (though what this practice is exactly is never detailed in the series). A similar seating construction appears to be present in the later machines with the device clearly identified as the computer placed in the center.\n\nInformation given in the show also suggests that deflector shields were not used until the 1953 invasion, after a recon mission proved that humanity had the means of effectively damaging their machines. The limited strength of their unprotected warships is also suggested by the fact that two or more of them were downed by a militia of no more than just 38 men. Curiously, a late episode features a mysterious Martian pod found that is made of an element that is, by all accounts, virtually indestructible. The pod in question appears to have to no weaponry and can only seat a single alien. Its purpose is not given, leaving its connection to the invasion and the aliens' technological progress unknown.\n\nThere are several differences between the fighting machines as described in Wells' novel and those in Steven Spielberg's 2005 film, which come from an undisclosed alien world. In this version the tripods were long ago brought to Earth, having been buried underground sometime in its distant past. The aliens instead travel in capsules to their buried machines by some kind of \"beaming\" process resembling lightning (from where or what is never revealed), which transports them underground. The lightning containing the capsules travel faster than the human eye can see, and the unearthing of the first fighting machine suggests they may have each been kept in something similar to a cylinder (which might have been part of a rocket or other transportation that brought them to Earth long ago). In a published interview screenwriter David Koepp stated his belief that they were planted by these extraterrestrials as a part of some kind of alien \"contingency plan\" (said plan never being revealed to the audience).\n\nThe features of the fighting machines of this film also differ. They do not possess the novel's killing chemical black smoke and are equipped with some type of invisible force shield that only becomes visible when struck by Earth weapons; no human weapons can penetrate them (an obvious reference to George Pal's original 1953 film). They are armed with two heat-ray-like weapons that incinerate humans to ash, leaving the victim's clothing behind while destroying and burning everything else; this caused confusion for some viewers and also among critics. It has been suggested that the aliens' heat-ray only destroys \"organic\" matter, but this does not fully explain the destruction of buildings and vehicles, nor the untouched cotton and wool of clothes, both of which are organic. Another offered explanation is that the heat-ray is a high energy coherent emission of microwaves similar to a Maser that causes the water in the human body to superheat into very high temperature steam, which then causes the victim to explode into ash as it instantly expands; this would also account for the metal objects it hits catching fire as they heat up, like metal objects placed in an activated microwave oven. The lethality of the fighting machines can be summed up in a phrase spoken in the film (a paraphrase of a line from the 1953 Pal film): \"Once the tripods start to move, no more news comes out of that area.\"\n\nThe fighting machines of this film have several searchlights mounted on the fronts of their main \"heads,\" facing forward for navigation and night illumination. As in Wells' novel, the tripod's three legs are completely flexible, even rubber-like in their appearance and movement, with no visible mechanical joints or pivot-points; they propel themselves by truly \"walking\" over any terrain. This can be viewed as faithful to the original novel, where Wells describes the fighting machines as being more organic than mechanical in their appearance. Spielberg's tripods also emit loud, deep bellows, which seem to be a means of calling out to one other, similar to how Wells' originally described them doing in his novel. The sounds used by the tripods in the film consist of one loud 113 Hz blast (between A2 and A#2 on the musical scale) for three seconds, followed by a deep 136 Hz blast (near C#3) for another three seconds, sounding very much like Earth lighthouse foghorn blasts. Some have noted that the bellows created by the Tripods sound similar to a Gjallarhorn, specifically the one the Minnesota Vikings installed after moving to U.S. Bank Stadium. The fighting machines are also equipped with numerous retracting and expanding tentacles for capturing humans and for other tasks. They also have two possibly detachable metal-wire cages attached directly underneath along the rear and on each side of the machine's main body, used for temporary human prisoner storage; a metal hatch in the body over each cage dials open, revealing an organic hole that then opens to allow a smaller tentacle to reach into the cage, pulling a captured victim into the machine every few minutes for off-camera blood processing. At one point, it is revealed that a human with explosives, after getting put into one of the cages and later being pulled into the tripod, destroys its interior by detonating the explosives, demonstrating an effective, yet highly risky method of bringing down a tripod.\n\nAdditionally, the fighting machines of this film have a tentacle that is used as a camera probe to explore small places, such as the inside of buildings, and another used as a pipette to drain human blood directly from humans. The collected human blood is then sprayed from the tripods' \"heads\" as fertilizer to aid the spread of their fast-growing terraforming red weed. Similar to the novel, the fighting machines appear to emit some kind of novel-like black smoke before arming and firing the heat-ray, although this may only be accumulated dust and fine debris or a chemical steam for clearing vents. The huge tripods appear to have been made to resemble the aliens themselves. They have three legs, each with three branching toe pads, a large mantle-head, and three arms with three-fingered hands attached to their thin bodies; the tripods' main body and the aliens' heads resemble cuttlefish.\n\nIn Pendragon Pictures' low-budget, direct-to-DVD \"H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds\" (aka \"Invasion\" internationally or \"War of the Worlds\"), the only Victorian-set adaptation of Wells' novel, the tripod fighting machine design is loosely based on the look of a praying mantis, which, according to director Timothy Hines, was a favorite insect of H. G. Wells.\n\nTripods have a large, free-moving head atop the smaller main body, giving its sole Martian occupant a panoramic view. It has four thick, metallic tentacles, which are held on high, made up of boxy-looking segments, making them appear like large bicycle chains rather than slim and whip-like, as described in Wells' novel; they are used mainly to capture humans during the film. The tripods have three long, ridged, and stilt-like legs, which occasionally stride with the right and rear leg moving forward together in a clumsy, unconvincing manner. The heat-ray sits atop the tripod \"head\" and has a round, spinning mirror on a metallic arm; when the mirror rotates rapidly, it emits a long-range heat-ray. The deadly chemical black smoke is emitted from the tips of the thick tentacles in the form of a spray, instead of the novel's gun-like device that fires canisters of the deadly gas over distances. The fighting machines each have a collecting basket for storing captured humans, but in the film it looks more like a standard solid metal bucket. There are other Martian machines seen in the film: a four-legged fighting machine and six-legged handling machines that somewhat resemble scorpions.\n\nIn the Asylum's 2008 sequel \"\", the walkers are tripods called \"squid-walkers\", and are capable of flight. Unlike the first film, the Martians do not control the fighting machines directly from the inside but manipulate cyborgs by remote control. A heat-ray is attached to the walkers, as well as a kind of ray that teleports humans directly to the alien mothership, where humans are then drained of their blood to feed the invaders. Whereas Wells' fighting machines carried cages to hold captured humans, these tripods place humans directly into the tripods' interiors. These appear organic, with no windows or controls, and the walls absorb anyone unlucky enough to touch them, sending them to an unknown destination.\n\nThe fighting machines are described in \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\" and depicted on the album artwork painted by Michael Trim. This version of the tripods does have major inconsistencies when compared to Wells' description in the novel; for example, the heat-ray emanates from a proboscis in the cupola rather than from a camera-like box carried by an articulated arm on the tripod, the basket to hold captured humans is a cage on the handling machines instead of the fighting machines, and the \"cowl\" (cockpit) of the fighting machine is fixed in place, instead of being a separately moving hood. The three legs of the fighting machine have fixed joints and stiff legs rather than the jointless, free-flowing organic legs described in Wells' novel. They are also described in the prologues of the live stage versions as being modified versions of similar walking machines the Martians use on Mars.\n\nThis interpretation of the Martian tripods also appears in the 1998 and 1999, video games based on the Jeff Wayne album.\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson' \"The Martian War\" the Martians use two type of tripods, the ones from \"The War of the Worlds\" and a smaller, \"overseer\" variant. In \"Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds\", the fighting machines are described as having legs that can telescope down allowing for entry and exit, and as being possibly based upon the original body type of the Martians.\n\nThe second volume of the comic book \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" retells the story of \"The War of the Worlds\", and the tripods are prominently featured. The aliens are not actual Martians as many of the characters believe, but are actually from a further world and are forced off of Mars by John Carter. These fighting machines are more organic-looking than in other depictions, with wide, crested heads, and it is implied that the materials of the machines are secreted by the aliens themselves. They are depicted with details of the tripods from Wells' original novel; they have the heat-ray and baskets for captured humans. The fighting machines are shown to be destroyed by heavy artillery, launched from Captain Nemo's submarine. Furthermore, Edward Hyde brings down a tripod by ripping off one of its legs, questioning why the aliens would use a tripedal machine as a form of transport. A tripod is left standing as a memorial, and is seen gradually decaying throughout the events of (set in 1958) and \"\" (set in various dates between 1910 and 2009).\n\nAlien tripod fighting machines have appeared in several novels, movies, video games, and television series. In John Christopher's trilogy an alien species has subdued the Earth. The aliens travel in three-legged machines known as tripods, as they cannot survive in Earth's atmosphere. \"The Tripods\" was later made into a BBC TV serial, which ran for two series but was cancelled before the three-part story was completed.\n\nIn Larry Niven's \"Rainbow Mars\" 31st century time travelers, passing through the late 19th century, observe the Martian fighting machines attack a Brazilian city.\n\nThe tripods also inspired the AT-AT, AT-ST, and other war-machines in the \"Star Wars\" series.\n\nIn \"Scary Movie 4\", a spoof of Spielberg's film, the fighting machines have only three tentacles and fire the heat-ray from their central eyes. When the first tripod emerges, it appears as a giant iPod (named a triPod), playing through a playlist of songs before selecting \"\"Destroy humanity\"\".\n\nCreatures and machines similar to the fighting machines are featured in many video games, such as the Striders from \"Half-Life 2\" and their companions, the Hunters from Crysis and its sequels and spin-offs; Annihilator Tripods from \"\"; Colossi from \"\"; Science Walkers and Defilers from \"Universe at War\", and Darkwalkers, which use rays and emit a similar noise, from \"Unreal Tournament 3\".\n\nAlien tripod mecha have appeared in many animated films and TV series, for example: the three-part pilot of the \"Justice League\"; the Japanese animated film \"Be Forever Yamato\"; in episodes of \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\", \"Ed, Edd, n Eddy\" and \"Kim Possible\", as well as (albeit based on automotive spark plugs, and with four legs) in a daydream sequence in the 2006 film \"Cars\".\n\nInspired by the tripods, and the Japanese anime \"Space Runaway Ideon\", several of the Buff Clan's have three legs.\n\nIssues #7 and #12 of the \"Sonic X\" comic book feature a three-legged alien machine reminiscent of a tripod. The machine is armed with laser weapons and shields, and goes on destructive rampages when activated. The origins of the craft, however, has not yet been explained.\n\nThe \"\" collectible miniatures game also has its own version of the tripods, called the Ares. Developed under the fictional \"Rhodes Project\", the 135-ton mechs closely resemble the tripods in the Steven Spielberg film, except that their legs are more squat and robust. Their names are also adapted from prominent Greek gods (Hera, Hades, Zeus, Poseidon).\n\nIn the 2005 movie \"Chicken Little\", alien tripods attack the Earth. The aliens themselves sit inside the tripods and they are similar to \"The War of the Worlds\" Martians.\n\nIn the animated superhero film \"Ultimate Avengers 2\", a race of aliens called the Chitauri invade Earth. Machines resembling Wells' fighting machines are briefly seen attacking London, as a deliberate homage to \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\nIn the 2010 TV movie \"High Plains Invaders\", a Western film about an alien invasion of the American Wild West in the 1890s, the alien antagonists were inspired by the machines of Wells' novel. The fighting machines walk upon legs (four legs instead of three) and carry a weapon above their head on a neck, resembling the Martian heat-ray from George Pal's 1953 film adaptation.\n\n\n"}

After the war, recovering from tuberculosis in a British Legion Sanatorium, he published his first novel, \"Voices Offstage\" (1947), and began submitting comedy scripts to BBC radio, selling some to Jon Pertwee's radio show \"Waterlogged Spa\". This led to work on television, including the BBC's children's show \"Whirligig\" (1950), where he met actress Sheilah Ward, whom he married in 1954.\n\nIn 1952 he was invited to write comic strips for the \"Eagle\", including the schoolboy series \"The Three J's\", illustrated by artist Peter Kay (1953–59), which was adapted for television in 1958. With Ward, he also co-wrote strips for \"Eagle\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sister title \"Girl\", including \"Two Pairs of Skates\" (1956–57) and \"Penny Starr\" (1957).

The two writers followed this up with \"Crossroads\", a soap set in a motel, which began on ITV in 1964; the format's principal run lasted until 1988. The writing partners followed it with \"Champion House\", a Yorkshire family saga set in the textiles industry, shown on the BBC from 1967 to 1968. Ling wrote for \"Dixon of Dock Green\", \"Sexton Blake\", \"No Hiding Place\", \"Doctor Who\" (\"The Mind Robber\", 1968), and, with Sheilah Ward, \"The Avengers\" (\"Ashes of Roses\", \"Dance with Death\", and \"Box of Tricks\").\n\nHe continued to write for radio, including adaptations of Sherlock Holmes and Gideon Fell stories and the Arnold Bennett novel \"Imperial Palace\", and wrote scripts for the Radio 2 soap Waggoner's Walk in 1969.\n\nHe published several novels, including the novelisation of his \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Mind Robber\" for Target Books; three novels in the \"Crown House\" series, \"Crown House\" (1988), \"Crown Papers\" (1989) and \"Crown Wars\" (1996); three in the \"Docklands Saga\" or \"Watermen\" series, \"High Water\" (1991), \"Flood Water\" (1992) and \"Storm Water\" (1993); two stand-alone novels, \"Halfway to Heaven\" (1994) and \"Happy Tomorrow\" (1995); and bodice-rippers under the name Petra Lee.

{"id": "2210868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210868", "title": "Repetition blindness", "text": "Repetition blindness\n\nRepetition blindness (RB) is a phenomenon observed in rapid serial visual presentation. People are sometimes poor at recognizing when things happen twice. Repetition blindness is the failure to recognize a second happening of a visual display. The two displays are shortly shown usually for about 150 milliseconds, and then they are shown within 500 milliseconds of each other (Kanwisher, 1987). Repetition blindness tasks usually are words in lists and in sentences. They are called phonologically similar items (Bavelier & Potter, 1992). There are also pictures, and words that include pictures. An example of this is a picture of the sun and the word sun (Bavelier, 1994). The most popular task used to examine repetition blindness is to show words one after another on a screen fast in which participants must recall the words that they saw. This task is known as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Repetition blindness is present if missing the second word creates an inaccurate sentence. An example of this is \"When she spilled the ink there was ink all over.” An RSVP sequence participants will recall seeing \"When she spilled the ink there was all over.\" However, they are missing the second occurrence of \"ink\" (Kanwisher, 1987). This finding supports that people are \"blind\" for the second occurrence of a repetitive item in an RSVP series. \nFor example, a subject's chances of correctly reporting both appearances of the word \"cat\" in the RSVP stream \"dog mouse cat elephant cat snake\" are lower than their chances of reporting the third and fifth words in the stream \"dog mouse cat elephant pig snake\".\n\nThe precise mechanism underlying RB has been extensively debated. Nancy Kanwisher has argued that it involves failure to tokenize the second appearance of a repeated stimulus, leading to the second appearance being dropped from short term memory before it can be reported. However, Whittlesea and colleagues have argued that repetition blindness arises from a failure to properly reconstruct the list, both online and post list. This failure to properly reconstruct the list arises from the poor encoding cues that are the result of the RSVP task.\n\n\n"}

The series debuted on July 10, 2005 and centered on the family life of professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (Terry Bollea). Often focusing on the Hogans' raising of their children, and on Hulk Hogan's attempts to manage and assist in his children's burgeoning careers, the title of the show is a spoof of the 1950s television series, \"Father Knows Best\".\n\nAfter the cancellation of \"Hogan Knows Best\" in 2007, a spin-off entitled \"Brooke Knows Best\" debuted in 2008, and ran for two seasons.\n\n\nThe series premiered on July 10, 2005 with a 1.9 (cable Nielsen rating), representing the largest audience for a VH1 premiere ever at that time. It began airing on CMT in early 2006 and also aired on Viva, MTV and Bio. in the UK and Ireland, TVtropolis in Canada, MusiquePlus in Quebec (in Quebec French, the show was called \"Hogan a raison\", \"Hogan is right\"), Both VH1 (Seasons 1 - 3) and MTV (Season 4) in Australia, MTV Italia in Italy (in English with Italian subtitles), MTV Central in Germany and Austria (in English with German subtitles), VH1, MTV Portugal in Portugal (in English with Portuguese subtitles), in The Netherlands on MTV Netherlands with Dutch subtitles and in India on VH1, in France on Game one (\"le monde merveilleux de Hulk Hogan\", \"\"The Wonderful World of Hulk Hogan\"\"), C4 and The Box in New Zealand. in Norway both on MTV Norway and VH1 with Norwegian subtitles, in Latin America with Spanish subtitles on VH1 (in Spanish, the show is \"Papá Hogan a la Lucha!\") and in Brazil with Portuguese subtitles on VH1 (the show is called \"Papai Hogan Sabe Tudo\" or \"'Daddy Hogan Knows All'\"). In Finland with Finnish subtitles on Sub and MTV Finland (the show is called \"Hurjat Hoganit\", \"Furious Hogans\").\n\nThe show was originally pitched and offered to Hulk Hogan prior to his famous WrestleMania X8 \"Icon vs. Icon\" match with The Rock in 2002. It chronicled Hogan's return to the World Wrestling Entertainment after the demise of the World Championship Wrestling and surgery on both of his knees. Hogan declined. However, after later noticing the success of pop stars such as Hilary Duff and Britney Spears, Hogan accepted a deal to do the show as a way to help promote daughter Brooke's singing career. In the episode \"Hulkamania Forever\", Hulk also mentions that the family has no source of income as lawyer and music studio bills in excess of $200,000 had come in recently.\n\nHogan explains in his 2009 autobiography \"My Life Outside the Ring\", that paying unionized camera crews to film subjects continuously until something telegenic or dramatic occurs would prohibitively expensive, and that as a result, shows such as \"Hogan Knows Best\" are \"soft-scripted\", and follow a tightly regimented shooting schedule that allows for typical work-related considerations such as lunch breaks. When filming soft-scripted shows, the subjects are given a scenario by the producers to act out, perhaps an exaggerated version of something likely to be encountered in their real lives, are informed of the outcome, and possible \"beats\" in between, and instructed to improvise, which Hogan says is a version of what he did as a professional wrestler. According to Hogan, this would result in behavior that members of his family would never exhibit in real life, as when his son, Nick tossed water balloons at neighbors from a window, or when his wife would wake up early to apply makeup and do her hair before camera crews arrived to film shots of the couple sleeping.\n\nIt was reported that taping for an additional season of \"Hogan Knows Best\" halted in the summer of 2007, before it was finally determined that the show was canceled in early 2008 due to problems involving Nick, Linda, and Terry Bollea.\n\nOn August 26, 2007, Nick was involved in a car crash while speeding in his Toyota Supra in Clearwater, Florida. Nick was sent to the hospital and released the following morning. However, his friend was seriously injured as a result of the car accident. Nick was charged with a felony for reckless driving and underage drinking. Also he was charged with violating limits on blood alcohol levels while driving. He was arrested on November 7, 2007, and sent to jail. However, his parents released him on a $10,000 bond shortly thereafter. Nick's friend, 22-year-old active-duty Marine John Graziano, is now on life support with serious brain injuries. It is now expected that he will require lifelong care, requiring him to spend the remainder of his life in a nursing home. The Hogan family issued a statement on how they were saddened that criminal charges had been filed against Nick, and how John was not wearing his seatbelt, but that Nick was. On May 9, 2008, Bollea entered a no contest plea and was sentenced to eight months in Pinellas County Jail.\n\nIn 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting \"Hogan Knows Best\", Hulk Hogan allegedly cheated on Linda Claridge with a female friend of his daughter's, Christiane Plante. Plante, the one to confess to the affair with Hulk Hogan, worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album. Plante, 21 years younger than Hulk Hogan, claimed: \"My relationship with Terry began at a time when Terry and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending. She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed. Terry is a good man, good father and a good friend, and he and I grew close at a time when he was going through a very difficult period. It seemed right then, but I know it was wrong. Having felt the guilt and pain build up, I gave a note to Brooke apologizing for my actions. I will never be able to fully forgive myself for this. I have lost an amazing friend.\"\n\nOn November 24, 2007, it was announced that Linda filed for divorce from Hulk Hogan after 24 years of marriage. Hogan was uninformed of this until a reporter showed him the paperwork submitted by his wife. Linda had been away from him for three weeks in California when she submitted the paperwork. In court papers, Linda states the marriage is \"irretrievably broken.\" In the court papers, she also addresses custody of their son, Nick, asking for primary physical custody of him, while Hulk would receive \"liberal visitation and access to the child.\" Linda is reportedly seeking half of the couple's $9.5m in assets, including a stake in their Bellaire mansion in Florida. In addition, Linda also asks for alimony, child support, and Hulk to pay for Nick's health insurance and take out a life insurance policy to cover child support for Nick if necessary.\n\nAfter filing for divorce in November 2007, Linda (48 at the time) began dating Charlie Hill (19 at the time) in December 2007. Hill was a student at Brooke and Nick's high school, one grade above Nick and one grade below Brooke. In November 2008, Linda revealed to the public that she made the decision to end her marriage after finding out about Hulk Hogan's alleged affair.\n\nDue to the accident and legal issues that surrounded Nick and the divorce between Linda and Terry, the show was canceled. After the show's cancellation, a spin-off came out entitled \"Brooke Knows Best\" which focuses on Brooke Hogan independent from her parents, living with two roommates. The spin-off was cancelled the following year, after surviving only two seasons.\n\nJill Murphy from Common Sense Media gave the show 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"Hogan Knows Best\" Seasons 1, 2, & 3 were released on DVD on September 25, 2007 exclusively at Suncoast and FYE. \"Hogan Knows Best\" Season 1 was released on DVD regions 2 and 4 in early 2008.

He studied at Leighton Park School in Reading and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, where he won the John Gielgud Scholarship. He worked in repertory theatre and had a season at the Old Vic in London. Allen also appeared in several films, including \"A Night to Remember\" (1958) about the sinking of the \"Titanic\", the espionage film \"A Circle of Deception\" (1960), the British horror films \"The Projected Man\" (1966) and \"The Fiend\" (1972), the war film \"Hell Boats\" (1970), and the black comedy \"Eat the Rich\" (1987).\n\nAfter roles in the BBC soaps \"Compact\" (1963–64) and \"United!\" (1966–67) came his best remembered role, in the long-running \"Crossroads\" (1969–85). Allen played David Hunter, who was a shareholder of the Crossroads Motel with Meg Mortimer, Tish Hope and Bernard Booth. He also twice appeared as a lead actor in the science fiction programme \"Doctor Who\", in the stories \"The Dominators\" (1968) and \"The Ambassadors of Death\" (1970).\n\nAllen also frequently appeared as a guest in \"The Comic Strip Presents\". In the first episode, \"Five Go Mad in Dorset\" (1982), which spoofed Enid Blyton's \"The Famous Five\" stories, he makes a surprise appearance as Uncle Quentin; deliberately sending up his staid image, he most memorably told The Famous Five, \"Your Aunt Fanny is an unrelenting nymphomaniac – and I am a screaming homosexual\". Allen reprised the role in the sequel \"Five Go Mad on Mescalin\" (1983), and also appeared in \"South Atlantic Raiders Part 2\" (1990), \"The Strike\" (1988) and \"Oxford\" (1990), in addition to the feature film \"The Supergrass\" (1985). There was much comic mileage to be gained from Allen sending up his conservative image. In a 1987 interview, he said that he was approached by a very intimidating-looking punk who shook his hand and said, \"I thought you were really cool in \"The Supergrass\"\". Then, as he was about to walk away, he turned back and said, almost apologetically, \"I loved you in \"Crossroads\" too!\"\n\nOther roles included television's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1957), \"Danger Man\" (1960, 1961), \"Bergerac\" (1990) and \"The Avengers\" (1964).\n\nAllen lived with his partner Brian Hankins, who also appeared in \"Crossroads\". Allen played smooth motel director David Hunter. He was also very close friends with his co-star and on-screen wife, Sue Lloyd. When the British media started to intrude into their private lives, they made it known they were a couple. After Allen was told that his cancer was terminal, they married. He died three months later, aged 60. Sue Lloyd died twenty years later in 2011, also of cancer.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

He was born in McAllen, Texas, went to Sharyland High School, but was raised and makes his home in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.\n\nCantú was spotted by a scout while playing in a Junior Olympic tournament in Mexico City while in high school, and offered a contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at age 16. In 2003, Cantú played for the Mexico national team in the regional Olympic qualifying tournament.
