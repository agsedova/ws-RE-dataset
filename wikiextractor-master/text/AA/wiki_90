{"id": "1900616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900616", "title": "Fangface", "text": "Fangface\n\nFangface is a 30-minute Saturday morning cartoon produced by Ruby-Spears Productions for ABC which aired from September 9, 1978, to September 8, 1979. The executive producers were Joe Ruby and Ken Spears.\n\nHighly derivative of \"Scooby-Doo\" (which was also created by Ruby and Spears) with a bit of the Tasmanian Devil and \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\" thrown in, \"Fangface\" features four teenagers — buff and handsome leader Biff, his brainy and beautiful dusky-skinned girlfriend Kim, short, stocky and pugnacious Puggsy and tall, skinny simpleton Sherman \"Fangs\" Fangsworth. Puggsy and Fangs are based on Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall of the \"Bowery Boys\" films.\n\nFangs transforms into a wildly whirling werewolf named Fangface whenever he looks at the full moon, a picture of the moon, or anything resembling the moon. Fangface has one large fang in the middle of his upper jaw which protrudes over his lower lip, and he has brown fur with tan paws, a muzzle, and a lupine tail tip. The four kids drive around in a sleek convertible dune buggy called the \"Wolf-Buggy\", catch crooks and solve crimes involving monsters and evil masterminds. Fangs sits in the backseat next to Puggsy, while Fangface rides on Puggsy's shoulders.\n\nDespite the temporary difficulty of Fangface always attacking Puggsy after he first transforms, the gang never hesitates to initiate the transformation to take advantage of the werewolf's power to cope with any danger. Indeed, they often refer to Fangface as their \"secret weapon\", even though very few people are afraid of him. Fangface and Fangs are unaware of each other, but Fangface lives in the moment, so he never seems to question why he's suddenly in a new place, whereas Fangs is always bewildered upon reversion.\n\nOddly if perhaps not surprisingly, considering how much Puggsy bullies the cowardly Fangs in his weak-willed human form, whenever Fangface sees food or hears a food word like \"turkey\", he tries to eat Puggsy or eats him whole, although he doesn't chew or swallow him and just contentedly leaves him trapped in his hugely bulging chipmunk-like cheeks. The only way to get Puggsy out of Fangface's jaws is for either Biff or Kim to rub Fangface's foot, thereby calming him down and releasing Puggsy.\n\nAnother bizarre personality trait is that whenever Fangface sees his reflection in a mirror, he goes completely wild and starts to howl uncontrollably. In this feral state he only relies on instinct, usually to the detriment of Puggsy or whoever else is with him, although even this can sometimes be used to the good guys' advantage, sometimes with an addition of an order given to him, as demonstrated near the ending of \"A Heap of Trouble\", as well as \"Dr. Lupiter and the Thing from Jupiter\", \"A Creep from the Deep\", and \"Westward Ho to the UFO\".\n\nEven though Fangs and Fangface are completely different in their personalities, they have similarities to one another. Fangs and Fangface both wear a backwards-facing orange cap (although the rest of Fangs' clothes disappear when he transforms), and both are loyal friends of Kim, Biff and Puggsy. Fangs and Fangface also say the phrase \"Ooh! Ooh!\" (the trademark exclamation of Joe E. Ross) before expressing an idea, as heard in the episode \"The Evil Design Of Vulture-Man's Mind\".\n\nFangs is basically comic relief on the show, having no real use as himself and getting changed into Fangface whenever he's needed (although Fangs does show a spark of use whenever he's super scared). When he's super scared, he loses his normal dimwittedness and comes up with a super good idea to save his super scared neck.\n\nAnother interesting occurrence is the barrage of invented words that the character Puggsy says, such as 'scramify' and 'rescuefy' in the episode \"The Ill-Will Of Dr. Chill\", which can be heard throughout the series.\n\nIn the episode \"Don't Abra When You Cadabra\", it is revealed that Fangs has an uncle named Arnie (rumored possibly to be baby werewolf Fangpuss's father), who runs a video arcade in New York City called \"Arnie's Arcade\".\n\nDuring Season 1, Fangface would see the sun or any representation thereof, and transform back to Fangs at inconvenient times (without remembering anything), as shown in the episode \"Space Monster Mishap\", long before the gangs' case would be over. As a result, the gang would have to transform him back into Fangface in order to complete their case.\n\nSixteen 30-minute episodes of \"Fangface\" were produced for the 1978 season from 8:30–9:00 a.m.\n\nWhen the series first aired, there was no TV Parental Guidelines rating system, but with repeats the show has been rated as TV-G.\n\nThe opening title narration, voiced by John Stephenson, for each episode consists of the following:\n\nIn 1979, the second season titled Fangface and Fangpuss aired as a segment on \"The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show\" and introduced a new character: Baby Fangs, Fangs' infant cousin who turns into a baby werewolf called Fangpuss (which contradicts the opening narration stating that only one werewolf is born into the family every 400 years, but, of course, that werewolf could be born through another family which may be married to the Fangsworth family). The show remained in the same mystery-adventure style as the first season, but episodes were now shortened to 15-minute segments. Sixteen episodes of \"Fangface and Fangpuss\" were produced for the 1979–80 season.\n\nThe episodes \"The Creepy Goon from the Spooky Lagoon\" and \"Dr. Lupiter and the Thing from Jupiter\" are the only season two episodes in which Baby Fangs/Fangpuss did not make an appearance.\n\nJust as Fangs is unaware that he is Fangface, Fangs is also unaware that his cousin, Baby Fangs, is Fangpuss. When Fangs sees Fangpuss, in the episode \"There Is Nothing Worse Than A Stony Curse\", he becomes scared and runs off.\n\nDuring Season 2, Fangface and Fangpuss would never see the sun, or a representation, as shown in the episode \"There Is Nothing Worse Than A Stony Curse\", and transform back to normal before the gangs' case would be over.\n\n\"Fangface and Fangpuss\" ran from September 22, 1979, to September 27, 1980; it then became a separate series in 1981 and, like the original \"Fangface\", ran for just one season. After this series, Fangface and company faded into obscurity until reruns began to air on Cartoon Network and Boomerang.\n\n\n\n\nTo date, \"Fangface\" has not been released on DVD.\n\n"}

They decried those who accepted the conditions attached to the \"\" indult, applying to them the term \"indult Catholics\", and frequently did not recognise them as fellow traditionalists.\n\nIn 1988 following the canonically illicit consecration, at Ecône, Switzerland, of four Society of St. Pius X members as bishops by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, John Paul II recommended, in \"Ecclesia Dei\", a \"wide and generous application\" of the norms in \"\" and established the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" to facilitate the return of traditionalist Catholics into full communion with the Holy See.\n\nThe term \"indult Catholic\" became useless as a polemic in 2007 when Pope Benedict XVI promulgated, in \"Summorum Pontificum\", a universal law for the Catholic Church which reformed the norms about the older usage of the Roman rite of Mass. It replaced the norms in ' and ', which regulated through diocesan level indults, with universal church law. Benedict XVI wrote that \"precise juridical norms\" regulating the use of the 1962 Missal were missing because some bishops \"feared that the authority of the Council would be called into question.\" Benedict XVI wrote that while \"fidelity to the old Missal became an external mark of identity\" in the Society of St. Pius X, \"the reasons for the break which arose over this, however, were at a deeper level.\"\n"}

It was dedicated to a revival of learning on the Continental trilingual model and from the outset laid emphasis on the knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew. In 1579, nineteen years after the Reformation brought fundamental changes to the religious life of the Scottish nation, St Mary's College was reconstituted, under the influence of Andrew Melville, as the Faculty of Divinity of the university.\n\nAt its foundation in 1538 St Mary's was intended to be a College for instruction in Divinity, Law, and Medicine, as well as in Arts, but its career on this extensive scale was short-lived. Under a new foundation and erection, confirmed by Parliament in 1579, it was set apart for the study of Theology only, and it has remained a Divinity College ever since. From 1580 onwards each Principal has acted as primarius Professor of \nDivinity, or first Master.\n\nSt Mary's College retains much of its original sixteenth century buildings, specifically the north and West ranges. The Quad contains a thorn tree said to have been planted by Mary, Queen of Scots, during her many visits to St. Andrews. The Quad also contains the historic King James Library founded by King James VI & I in 1612. In addition the College has The Roundel, a 16th-century building dedicated for doctoral students studying divinity at the University of St Andrews.\nThe college is one of five approved centres for the training of Church of Scotland ministers. Graduates include the Very Rev Dr Finlay Macdonald, the immediate past Principal Clerk to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and a former Moderator.\n\nAs of 1 May 2018, the Principal of St Mary's College was Rev. Dr. Stephen Holmes, also Head of the School of Divinity, who had replaced Ian Bradley (Professor Emeritus).\n\nAs of May 2015, the Faculty and School of Divinity forms an academic community of some 131 persons: 16 members of staff; 55 postgraduate students; and 60 undergraduates. According to The Complete University Guide 2016 the School of Divinity is placed first in the United Kingdom for undergraduate studies ahead of Durham in second place and Cambridge in third. In the 2016 Guardian University Guide it is also ranked first in the United Kingdom in religious studies and theology.\n\nThe college has four research centres.\n\nThe Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (ITIA) was founded within the college by professors Trevor Hart and Jeremy Begbie (currently Thomas A. Langford Research Professor at Duke Divinity School) in 2000. It \"aims to advance and enrich an active conversation between Christian theology and the arts – bringing rigorous theological thinking to the arts, and bringing the resources of the arts to the enterprise of theology.\" The current director is Dr Gavin Hopps.\n\nThe Centre for the Study of Religion and Politics (CSRP) was founded in November 2004 by a group of academics attached to the Schools of Divinity, International Relations, Modern Languages, and Philosophical and Anthropological Studies. The need for a centre of learning to consider the role of religion and politics was highlighted by the support garnered from a diverse range of scholars and religious and political figures who endorsed the Centre's establishment. These supporters who have continued as Patrons of the Centre include Gustavo Gutiérrez, Cardinal O'Brien, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Carole Hillenbrand, Ian Linden, Julian Filochowski, J.D.Y. Peel, Rev Joel Edwards, Professor George P. Smith II and Dr. P.T.W. Baxter. The current director is Professor Mario Aguilar\n\nThe Institute for Bible, Theology & Hermeneutics (IBTH) was established in 2009 to give formal identity to the long-standing project of research into Scripture and theology that has been associated with the work at St Mary's School of Divinity. The institute introduces its aims as seeking, \"To overcome the sense of fragmentation within the field of Divinity that burdens many within the Academy, promoting intra-disciplinary conversation between Biblical Studies and the various fields of Theology, thus providing a core identity for a more integrated discipline competent to engage in inter-disciplinary research. With the study of general hermeneutical theory and practice at its centre, it will be outward-looking and keen to engage with issues arising from the contemporary world.\" The current director is Dr Mark Elliott.\n\nThe Logos Institute for Analytic and Exegetical Theology was founded in 2016 by Professor Alan Torrance and Dr Andrew Torrance. The Institute \"is committed to scholarship that reflects a concern for: transparency; simplicity in expression; clear, logical argumentation; and rigorous analysis. It also reflects a radical commitment to interdisciplinary engagement, particularly between the fields of philosophy, theology, biblical studies, and the sciences. Its faculty consists of world-leading scholars in the fields of biblical studies, theology, and philosophy.\" The current director is Professor Alan Torrance.\n\n\n"}

The name was because an American and a \"Russian\" made up the team while the Cold War was still going strong.\n\nDusty Rhodes had been teaming with Magnum T.A. in the NWA for most of 1986. They were battling The Four Horsemen and were scheduled for a cage match against Tully Blanchard and Ole Anderson on October 24, 1986. Magnum had a car wreck that ended his career before the match and Jim Crockett, Jr. needed a replacement. On the night of the match, James J. Dillon (Blanchard was injured) and Ole Anderson were waiting in the cage to see who Dusty would bring out. It turned out to be \"The Russian Nightmare\" Nikita Koloff, a top heel in the promotion, with whom Magnum had previously been feuding. Koloff was actually American but was billed as being from Russia. Koloff and Rhodes defeated Dillon and Anderson in minutes and The Super Powers were born. Rhodes and Koloff participated in the 1987 Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament. They received a bye into the second round before defeating the teams of Bill Dundee and The Barbarian, Rick Rude and Manny Fernandez, and The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) to advance to the finals. In the final round, they defeated Lex Luger and Tully Blanchard, two members of the Four Horsemen, to win the tournament and its kayfabe prize of one million dollars. They participated in several WarGames matches, teaming with The Road Warriors against The Four Horsemen. The Super Powers teamed with several partners for the four-on-four matches, which took place in 1987 and 1988, and won each time. Dusty and Nikita feuded with the Horsemen until early 1988, when they stopped teaming. They also feuded with Nikita's \"uncle\" Ivan Koloff, who was mad that Nikita turned on him, along with Ivan's partners Vladimir Petrov and Dick Murdoch.\n\nIn 2003, they had a reformation in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling when Nikita was unmasked as \"Mr. Wrestling IV\" after attacking Rhodes several times. He then rejoined Dusty in fighting Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) stable during a ladder match between Rhodes and S.E.X. member Brian Lawler. Koloff interfered by climbing the ladder to retrieve the belt that was suspended above the ring. He then presented it to Rhodes, and the former partners hugged in the ring.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900653", "title": "Ecclesia Dei", "text": "Ecclesia Dei\n\nEcclesia Dei is the document Pope John Paul II issued on 2 July 1988 in reaction to the Ecône Consecrations, despite an express prohibition by the Holy See. It said that the two consecrating bishops and the four priests they consecrated were excommunicated. John Paul called for unity and established the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" to foster a dialog with those associated with the consecrations who hoped to maintain both loyalty to the papacy and their attachment to traditional liturgical forms.\n\nAs is customary for such a papal document, it takes its name from the opening words of its Latin text, \"Ecclesia Dei\", meaning \"God's Church\".\n\nOn 30 June 1988, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer consecrated four priests as bishops at the seminary of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) in Écône, Switzerland. The SSPX was an association of priests that Lefebvre had founded in 1970. Its members distrusted the changes then taking place in the Church in the years following the Second Vatican Council. Referring to these consecrations, the Pope wrote in \"Ecclesia Dei\": \"In itself, this act was one of \"disobedience\" to the Roman Pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church, such as is the ordination of bishops whereby the apostolic succession is sacramentally perpetuated. Hence such disobedience – which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy – constitutes a \"schismatic\" act (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 751). In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal \"canonical warning\" sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 1382).\"\n\nPope John Paul II went on to make \"an appeal both solemn and heartfelt, paternal and fraternal, to all those who until now have been linked in various ways to the movement of Archbishop Lefebvre, that they may fulfil the grave duty of remaining united to the Vicar of Christ in the unity of the Catholic Church, and of ceasing their support in any way for that movement. Everyone should be aware that formal adherence to the schism is a grave offence against God and carries the penalty of excommunication decreed by the Church's law (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 1364).\"\n\nThe Pope instituted the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" to assist those who had been associated with Archbishop Lefebvre but who wished \"to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church, while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions, in the light of the Protocol signed on 5 May last by Cardinal Ratzinger and Mons. Lefebvre\", a protocol that Archbishop Lefebvre later repudiated.\n\nThe Pope stated: \"Respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition, by a wide and generous application of the directives already issued some time ago by the Apostolic See for the use of the Roman Missal according to the typical edition of 1962\". In this the Pope expanded the scope of permission already granted under the 1984 special indult \"Quattuor Abhinc Annos\".\n\nThe conditions indicated in the document to which Pope John Paul referred were replaced on 7 July 2007 by those indicated in the \"motu proprio\" \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\nPope Benedict XVI gave the Commission additional functions with respect to the use of Tridentine liturgy in \"Summorum Pontificum\" on 7 July 2007. On 8 July 2009, in \"Ecclesiae unitatem\", he modified its position within the Roman Curia by making the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) the \"ex officio\" head of the Commission. On 17 January 2019, Pope Francis abolished the Commission and transferred its responsibilities to a \"special section\" within the CDF.\n\n\n"}

Canoe sprints are sometimes referred to as flat water racing. The distances recognized by the ICF for international canoe sprint races are 200m, 500m, and 1000m. These races take place on straight courses with each boat paddling in its own designated lane. Longer marathon races do exist, notably the 5000m (also an ICF-recognized distance) – these usually have athletes starting in a large pack at a start line before paddling around a set course with marked turning points (there are no assigned lanes). For each race a number of heats, semi-finals and a final may be necessary, depending on the number of competitors.\n\nThe sport is governed by the International Canoe Federation. The International Canoe Federation is the worldwide canoeing organization and creates the standard rules for the different disciplines of canoe/kayak competition. The ICF recognizes several competitive and non-competitive disciplines of canoeing, of which Sprint and Slalom are the only two competing in the Olympic games.\n\nOn the whole, Europe has dominated the sport, winning over 90 per cent of all available medals.\n\nThe official boats recognized by the ICF as 'International Boats' are: K1, K2, K4, C1, C2 and C4, where the number indicates the number of paddlers, “K” stands for kayak and “C” for canoe. The ICF rules for these boats define, among others, the maximum length, the minimum weight and the shape of the boats – for instance, a K1 must be 520 cm long and weighs at least 8 kg for marathons or 12 kg for sprints. Originally, width (beam) restrictions were also enforced; these were revoked in 2000, spurring a flurry of innovations in boat designs. Modern boats are usually made of carbon fiber, aramid fiber (e.g., Kevlar) with epoxy resin, or variants of high-performance fiber-glass.\n\nIn a kayak, the paddler is seated in the direction of travel, and uses a double-bladed paddle. Kayaks have a rudder for steering and course adjustment, which is operated by the feet of the paddler in the front. The paddle used is usually a 'wing paddle' (although standard asymmetrical paddles can also be used) – wing paddles have blades which are shaped to resemble a wing or spoon, creating lift and increasing the power and stability of the stroke. There are many variations of wing paddles, ranging from longer and narrower options for more stability throughout the entire stroke to more extreme 'teardrop' shaped paddles for a firmer application of power at the start of the stroke.\n\nIn a canoe the paddler kneels on one knee with the other leg forward and foot flat on the floor of the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only with what is known as a 'J-stroke' to control the boat's direction. In Canada, a racing class exists for the C-15 or WC or \"War Canoe\", as well as a similarly designed C-4 (which is much shorter and more squat than an 'International' C-4). An antiquated boat class is the C-7, resembling a large C4 which was debuted by the ICF with little success. For racing canoes, the blade is typically short and broad, with a 'power face' on one side that is either flat or scalloped out. The shaft will typically be longer than a tripping canoe paddle, because the kneeling position puts the paddler higher above the surface of the water. More recent designs of canoe racing paddles often have a slight bent shaft, commonly 12–14 degrees. (a concept of canoe designer Eugene Jensen in the 1960s). Many high-performance canoe paddlers prefer the feel of a wooden handle with a carbon fiber shaft and blade, while nearly all high-performance kayak paddlers use paddles made completely of carbon fiber.\n"}

Like its predecessor (the Eye of Terror Campaign) and its successor (The War of the Ring Online Campaign), it was extremely popular, and attracted several thousand players. \n\nThe basic premise was that players of Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Mordheim, and Warmaster were invited to register the results of their games at the Storm of Chaos Website, where a tactical map of the north of the Empire existed. Upon registering a battle, one army would be counted attacker, the other defender. Depending on which side the results favoured, either the attackers or the defenders would get a little more of the map, and occasionally some side benefits. \n\nFor several centuries, the Lord Archaon sought the six treasures of Chaos: The Armor, the Eye, the Blade, the Mark, the Steed, and the Crown. According to the myths of Chaos worshippers, the one who manages to gain them all will become the Everchosen, Lord of the End Times, the champion of the gods destined bring about the final triumph of Chaos. He finally managed to gain the six treasures in the year 2521 IC. At the same time, the Chaos Warlord Surtha Lenk attacked Kislev and pushed through to the Empire, sacking the Ostland capital of Wolfenburg before being crushed by Imperial reinforcements. \n\nAt the same time, Luthor Huss, a self-styled prophet of Sigmar, had started to challenge the hierarchy of the church of Sigmar. Huss claimed that the priesthood had become corrupt and decadent, ignoring the teachings of Grand Theogonist Volkmar the Grim and abandoning Sigmar's mission. Volkmar raised an army and journeyed to Kislev to confront Archaon. They lost, Volkmar was slain, and the war altar of Sigmar was cast down. A new Grand Theogonist, Johann Esmer, was elected, and was the epitome of everything that Luthor Huss and other grassroots clerics despised. \n\nTrapped in the Kislevite city of Praag, the Tzarina Katarin asked for aid from her old Dwarven ally Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King of Karak Kadrin, who responded by sending his armies, led by his son Garagrim Ironfist, to their aid.\n\nAs the horde of Archaon rampaged through Kislev and into the Empire, Emperor Karl Franz invited envoys from the neighbouring kingdoms, as well as representatives of the High Elves and from the Dwarfs to the \"Conclave of Light\". Here, he successfully gained the support of Bretonnia, the Dwarfs and the High Elves. Huss had in the meantime found a young man named Valten who bore striking physical resemblance to Sigmar as is described in the legends, except for a birthmark shaped like a twin-tailed comet, the main symbol of the Sigmarite church. Valten was also highly skilled in battle and had a will-power to endure wounds that would kill a normal man. Huss and his following travelled to Altdorf, the capital city of The Empire, where they demanded that Valten be recognised as the reincarnation of Sigmar and so proclaim him Emperor, ignoring the immense civil unrest such a declaration would cause. By now, it was late spring, and Karl Franz, both pragmatic politician and devout Sigmarite, could neither ignore nor accept Huss's demands. In the end, he proclaimed Valten was the \"spiritual heir\" of Sigmar, recognising that he was blessed to some degree, but wisely retained rulership for himself.\n\nIn the summer of the year IC (Imperial Calendar) 2522 Archaon attacked The Empire with the specific goal of desecrating the city of Middenheim, a holy site to the followers of Ulric, a warrior god who is second in popularity only to Sigmar.\n\n\nAccording to Games Workshop, the Storm of Chaos affected the whole world. Still, at the end of the campaign, the world seems to have regained its \"Status quo ante\". Gav Thorpe, the games designer who wrote the campaign, has stated that this was intentional and that the consequences of the Storm of Chaos will be up to the individual players.\n\nThe Storm of Chaos was rendered non-canon by the more recent End Times books, which made massive overarching changes to the rules, armies, factions and canon of the game, notably by removing several armies and completely changing the army selection system.\n\n"}

Abundance differs from excess in that a reactant in excess is simply any reactant other than the limiting reagent; the amount by which a reactant is in excess is often specified, such as with terms like \"twofold excess\", indicating that there is twice the amount of reactant necessary for the limiting reagent to be completely reacted.

In 1988, Pope John Paul II announced that Fellay and three others were automatically excommunicated for being consecrated as bishops by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, an act that the Holy See described as \"unlawful\" and \"schismatic\". Archbishop Lefebvre, and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer who co-consecrated these four bishops, were also excommunicated. At that time, he was the youngest bishop of the Roman Catholic Church at 29 years old.\n\nIn January 2009, at Fellay's request, the Congregation for Bishops, on instructions from Pope Benedict XVI, rescinded the excommunication.\n\nFellay was born in Sierre, Switzerland in 1958. In October 1977, at the age of nineteen, Fellay began studies for the priesthood at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône, Switzerland. On 29 June 1982 he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. After his ordination, he was named Bursar General of the SSPX and was stationed at Rickenbach, the headquarters of the SSPX in Switzerland. He continued in that position for the next ten years. He is fluent in French, Italian, English, German and knows Spanish.\n\nIn June 1988 Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate Fellay and three other priests (Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson, and Alfonso de Galarreta) as bishops. Lefebvre did not have a pontifical mandate for these consecrations (i.e. permission from the pope), normally required by Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law. On June 17, 1988 Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops sent the four priests a formal canonical warning that he would automatically incur the penalty of excommunication if they were to be consecrated by Lefebvre without papal permission.\n\nOn June 30, 1988 Fellay and the three other priests were consecrated bishop by Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer. On July 1, 1988 Cardinal Gantin issued a declaration stating that Lefebvre, de Castro Mayer, Fellay, and the three other newly ordained bishops \"have incurred \"ipso facto\" the excommunication \"latae sententiae\" reserved to the Apostolic See\".\n\nOn July 2, 1988, Pope John Paul II issued the \"motu proprio\" \"Ecclesia Dei\", in which he reaffirmed the excommunication, and described the consecration as an act of \"disobedience to the Roman pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church\", and that \"such disobedience — which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy — constitutes a schismatic act\".\nCardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, head of the commission responsible for implementing \"Ecclesia Dei\", has said this resulted in a \"situation of separation, even if it was not a formal schism.\"\n\nThe SSPX denied the validity of the excommunications, saying that the consecrations were necessary due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn July 1994 the General Chapter of the SSPX met at Écône and elected Fellay Superior General in succession to Father Franz Schmidberger. On 12 July 2006, he was re-elected for another term of 12 years.\n\nOn 29 August 2005, Fellay was received in audience by Pope Benedict XVI at Castel Gandolfo. The audience was also attended by Cardinal Castrillón Hoyos and Father Schmidberger. They discussed the present state of the Church and of the SSPX, the Society's concerns about Modernism in the Church, the restoration of the Tridentine Mass, and the possible recognition of the SSPX by the Holy See.\nBy a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority. The canonical situation of the four bishops thus became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended \"a divinis\".\n\nThe remissions have not been unanimously welcomed by all members of the SSPX. Florian Abrahamowicz, a SSPX's dean of Northeastern Italy, called the action \"insulting,\" since it claimed to remit an excommunication of these four bishops that the Society had officially maintained since 1988 did not exist. Abrahamowicz was very soon expelled by the Italian chapter of the Society of Saint Pius X for either that comment or his Holocaust-related remarks.\n\nCardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, has reported Fellay as declaring that if Archbishop Lefebvre had seen how Mass is celebrated in an abbey near Florence in strict accordance with the 1970 Missal, he would not have taken the step that he did take.\n\nSpeaking in relation to the talks with Rome in an interview in July 2009, Fellay said of the significance of the Second Vatican Council, \"We will not make any compromise on the Council. I have no intention of making a compromise. The truth does not tolerate compromise. We do not want a compromise, we want clarity regarding the Council.\" In February 2011, Fellay said that the reconciliation talks with the Vatican would soon be coming to an end, with little change in the views of either side. In addition to disputes over the changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council, new problems have been created by plans for the beatification of Pope John Paul II. Fellay said the scheduled beatification of Pope John Paul II on 1 May 2011 posed \"a serious problem, the problem of a pontificate that caused things to proceed by leaps and bounds in the wrong direction, along 'progressive' lines, toward everything that they call 'the spirit of Vatican II.'\" Bishop Williamson, in his weekly message, attacked Fellay for being too open to dialogue between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See. However, on 12 October 2013, Fellay declared, \"We thank God, we have been preserved from any kind of agreement from last year\", saying that the society had withdrawn the compromise text that it presented to Rome on 15 April 2012.\n\nOn the same occasion, he spoke of the Third Secret of Fatima as seemingly foretelling \"both a material chastisement and a great crisis in the Church\" and described Pope Francis as \"a genuine Modernist\", who, in late July 2013, had begun a series of contacts, regarding which Fellay said: \"We may not have the entire picture at this point, we have enough to be scared to death.\" He expressed a different view about Pope Francis on 11 May 2014, saying that Francis had read twice a biography of Archbishop Lefebvre and enjoyed it: \"With the current pope, as he is a practical man, he looks at people. What a person thinks, what he believes, is at the end a matter of indifference to him. What matters is that this person be sympathetic in his view, that he seems correct to him, one may say it like this./ And therefore he read twice Bp. Tissier de Mallerais' book on Abp. Lefebvre, and this book pleased him; he is against all that we represent, but, as a life, it pleased him.\" He also described how Pope Francis took a tolerant view of the FSSPX in Argentina, even saying that \"I will not condemn them, and I will not stop anyone from visiting them.\"\n\nOn 28 December 2012, in a radio interview aired from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Chapel in New Hamburg, Ontario, Canada, Bishop Fellay declared, “Who, during that time, was the most opposed that the Church would recognize the Society? The enemies of the Church. The Jews, the Masons, the Modernists.” That was taken by various media entities to be an attack on the Jewish people.\n\nThe Society of St. Pius X issued the following reply: \"The word 'enemies' used here by Bishop Fellay is of course a religious concept and refers to any group or religious sect which opposes the mission of the Catholic Church and her efforts to fulfill it: the salvation of souls... By referring to the Jews, Bishop Fellay's comment was aimed at the leaders of Jewish organizations, and not the Jewish people, as is being implied by journalists. Accordingly the Society of St. Pius X denounces the repeated false accusations of anti-Semitism or hate speech made in an attempt to silence its message.\"\n\nIt was reported on May 24, 2017, that SSPX bishops have been authorized by the Vatican to ordain priests without permission of the local bishop.\n\nIn July 2017, Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Pope Francis. The twenty-five page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate.\n\nFellay's term as Superior General concluded on July 11, 2018 upon the election of Davide Pagliarani as his successor.\n\n"}

It was first released in September 2005 as a smaller, lighter redesign of the Game Boy Advance. The system is the last console in the Game Boy line, alongside the AGS-101 series of Game Boy Advance SP. Unlike its predecessor, the Game Boy Micro lacks backward compatibility for Game Boy or Game Boy Color games.\n\nAccording to Nintendo of America vice president George Harrison, the idea for a smaller version of the Game Boy was first discussed in 2004. Harrison explained that unlike the traditional console development process, Nintendo was always thinking about new ideas for the Game Boy, describing it as a \"continuous process of invention\". Developed under the code name \"Oxy\", the company tried many ways to see how small they could make the Game Boy, opting for a metallic casing that, according to Nintendo Co. Ltd president Satoru Iwata, was \"unusual for Nintendo\".\n\nThe Game Boy Micro was announced by Nintendo of America's vice president of sales and marketing, Reggie Fils-Aimé, at the company's Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference on May 17, 2005. The system was released in Japan on September 13, 2005 and in North America on September 19, 2005. It was released in Europe on November 4, 2005 and Australia on November 3, 2005. It was released in China as the iQue Game Boy Micro on October 1, 2005, and later released in South Korea on November 9, 2005.\n\nThe Game Boy Micro retains some of the functionality of the Game Boy Advance SP, but with a more compact form factor. It cannot play original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games due to design changes. Although it still has the required LR35902 processor and graphics hardware necessary to run games from older Game Boy systems, it lacks other internal hardware necessary for backward compatibility. It is incompatible with the Nintendo e-Reader and other peripherals due to similar design issues. Additionally, it has a backlit screen with the ability to adjust the brightness. The shape itself is oblong, similar to the style of the Nintendo Entertainment System controller.\n\nThe Game Boy Micro features removable, decorative housing called a faceplate. Designs with special faceplates were sold as a customization feature. Faceplates for the Micro are made using in-mould decoration.\n\n\nThe Game Boy Micro has a two-way switch on its right side for adjusting volume. By holding down the L shoulder button, the switch can also be used to adjust the backlight between five levels of brightness.\n\nThe Game Boy Micro is compatible with Game Boy Advance games, including Game Boy Advance Video Game Paks.\n\nThe following games/accessories are not compatible with the Game Boy Micro system:\n\n\nWhile Game Boy or Game Boy Advance Game Link cables and the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter are not compatible with the Game Boy Micro system, adapters and a Game Boy Micro-compatible Wireless adapter have been released. Nintendo also redesigned their Play-Yan music/video adapter to better fit the Game Boy Micro. This device is able play MP3 and digital video files from SD cards.\n\nAs with the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP systems, there are no regional lockouts on software, so North American games can be played on Japanese or European hardware and vice versa.\n\nIn Japan, the Game Boy Micro was released in four different base colors: black, blue, purple, and silver. Also available at launch was a limited edition version, based on the controller of the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Famicom. In October 2005, Square Enix announced that they would be releasing a special faceplate, featuring artwork by Yoshitaka Amano, to promote their re-release of \"Final Fantasy IV\" on the Game Boy Advance. On November 17, 2005, Nintendo released a \"Pokémon\" version in Japan, featuring a red Micro with a black faceplate containing the silhouette of Pikachu. Another special edition of the Micro was released on April 20, 2006, which bundled \"Mother 3\" with a red Micro and a themed faceplate. \nIn the United States and Canada, the Game Boy Micro launched with two regular color choices, each sold with three interchangeable faceplates included: silver with black, \"Ammonite\" and \"Ladybug\" faceplates; and black with silver, \"Flame\" and \"Camouflage\" faceplates. The \"20th Anniversary\" edition was released on December 4, 2005, which was the Famicom controller-inspired version released in Japan.\n\nIn Europe the Game Boy Micro is available in four different colors, with one matching faceplate: silver, green, blue and pink. Game Boy Micro sold in Australia have the same colors (except Green which replaced by red color) as Europe.\n\nThere are reportedly no plans to sell additional faceplates in the US retail locations (as indicated in the letter page in issue 200 of Nintendo Power) or the UK. Nintendo of Europe cannot supply replacement faceplates of any kind, and the feature is omitted from the product's marketing, packaging, and manual in Europe. However, some third parties are manufacturing such faceplates for sale in the US and Europe, and some importers stock faceplates acquired from Japan. Nintendo of America sells some of the faceplates individually online.\n\nThe Game Boy Micro had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\n\n\nSatoru Iwata stated that the marketing of the Nintendo DS may have hurt the Micro in the marketplace and admitted that Game Boy Micro sales did not meet Nintendo's expectations.\n\nThe system retailed for US$99, compared to US$79 for the Game Boy Advance SP. The system was originally available in black and silver, and a red 20th Anniversary Edition was later released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nThe Game Boy Micro's backlit screen, which is superior to the original AGS-001 (frontlit) Game Boy Advance SP model (a later remodel, the AGS-101, added a similar high quality screen to SP systems), has been praised for its visibility. Due to a finer dot pitch, the screen is more evenly lit, and the brightness is adjustable. The smaller dot pitch has also improved the apparent sharpness of the display.\n\nThe removable faceplates have also been praised because they allow for personalization and protect the high-resolution backlit screen.\n\n\n"}

Many alchemists believed that as a first step in the pathway to the philosopher's stone, all alchemical ingredients had to be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter. \n\nIn analytical psychology, the term became a metaphor for 'the dark night of the soul, when an individual confronts the shadow within'.\n\nFor Carl Jung, 'the rediscovery of the principles of alchemy came to be an important part of my work as a pioneer of psychology'. As a student of alchemy, he (and his followers) 'compared the \"black work\" of the alchemists (the nigredo) with the often highly critical involvement experienced by the ego, until it accepts the new equilibrium brought about by the creation of the self'. Jungians interpreted nigredo in two main psychological senses.\n\nThe first sense represented a subject's initial state of undifferentiated unawareness, 'the first nigredo, that of the \"unio naturalis\", is an objective state, visible from the outside only...an unconscious state of non-differentiation between self and object, consciousness and the unconscious'. Here the subject is unaware of the unconscious; i.e. the connection with the instincts'.\n\nIn the second sense, 'the nigredo of the process of individuation on the other hand is a subjectively experienced process brought about by the subject's painful, growing awareness of his shadow aspects'. It could be described as a moment of maximum despair, that is a prerequisite to personal development. As individuation unfolds, so 'confrontation with the shadow produces at first a dead balance, a standstill that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective or even impossible...\"nigredo\", \"tenebrositas\", chaos, melancholia'. Here is 'the darkest time, the time of despair, disillusionment, envious attacks; the time when Eros and Superego are at daggers drawn, and there seems no way forward...\"nigredo\", the blackening'.\n\nOnly subsequently would come 'an enantiodromia; the \"nigredo\" gives way to the \"albedo\"...the ever deepening descent into the unconscious suddenly becomes illumination from above'\n\nFurther steps of the alchemical opus include such images as albedo (whiteness), citrinitas (yellowness), and rubedo (redness). Jung also found psychological equivalents for many other alchemical concepts, with 'the characterization of analytic work as an \"opus\"; the reference to the analytic relationship as a \"vas\", vessel or container; the goal of the analytic process as the \"coniunctio\", or union of conflicting opposites'.\n\n\n"}

The game was written and directed by The Wachowskis, who wrote and directed the three \"The Matrix\" films. Players control the character Neo, participating in scenes from the films.\n\nIn Shiny Entertainment's first licensed Matrix game, \"Enter the Matrix\", only sideline characters were playable. It did not feature the series' protagonist Neo, and due to its nature as an extension of the films' storyline, had few recreations of scenes in the film trilogy.\n\n\"The Matrix: Path of Neo\" allows the player to participate in many of the major action scenes in the films. Most of these sequences, picked by the movie directors themselves, are taken from the first film in the series.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player is hacker Thomas Anderson, and does not possess any of the powers that the character will later discover as Neo. As the game continues, players learn new skills and techniques, equipping Neo for the final showdown with Agent Smith. These additional skills may be levels and in the main game. Many of these skills are used by Neo in the trilogy, including the bullet dodge, bullet stop, and flight. A number of weapons are available in the game, consisting of both melee weapons (including various types of swords, staves, and escrimas) and firearms (assault rifle, submachine gun, pistol etc.).\n\nThe game also allows the player to meet many of the characters in the films, including Trinity, Morpheus and the Merovingian, amongst others.\n\nThe game uses film excerpts as cut scenes throughout the game at certain milestones.

{"id": "1900773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900773", "title": "Juliet", "text": "Juliet\n\nJuliet Capulet is the female protagonist in William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\". A 13-year-old girl, Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet. She falls in love with the main protagonist Romeo, a member of the House of Montague, with which the Capulets have a blood feud. The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself.\n\nOne aspect of the story which now seems problematic is Juliet's age. As the story occurs, Juliet is approaching her fourteenth birthday. She was born on \"Lammas Eve at night\" (1 August), so Juliet's birthday is 31 July (1.3.19). Her birthday is \"a fortnight hence\", putting the action of the play in mid-July (1.3.17). Her father states that she \"hath not seen the change of fourteen years\" (1.2.9). In many cultures and time periods, women did and do marry and bear children at an early age. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is a play about Italian families. Lady Capulet had given birth to her first child by the time she had reached Juliet's age: \"By my count, I was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid.\" (1.3.74–75).\n\nEven Capulet tries to encourage Paris to wait a little longer before even thinking of marrying his daughter, feeling that she is still too young; \"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride\". However, in the English poem the story is based on (\"Romeus and Juliet\" by Arthur Brooke) Juliet is approaching her sixteenth birthday and Romeo is the same age whereas in the Bandello novella she is nearly eighteen with Romeo about twenty. The common English people of that age were very rarely in their teens when they married and even among the nobility and gentry of the age, brides thirteen years of age were rare, at about one in one thousand brides; in that era, the vast majority of English brides were at least nineteen years of age when they first married, most commonly at about 23 years, and most English noblewomen were at least sixteen when they married. That the parts of young women were played by pre-adolescent boys in Shakespeare's day also cannot be overlooked and it is possible that Shakespeare had the physique of a young boy in mind during composition, in addition to the fact that Romeo and Juliet are of wealthy families and would be more likely to marry earlier than commoners. At the time, English noblewomen married on average at 19–21 years (compared to 24–26 years for English noblemen) while the average marriage age in England was 25–26 years for women and 27–28 for men; Sir Thomas More wrote in his \"Utopia\" that, in Utopia, women must be at least eighteen years of age when they marry and men at least 22 years.\n\nThe common belief in Elizabethan England was that motherhood before sixteen was dangerous; popular manuals of health, as well as observations of married life, led Elizabethans to believe that early marriage and its consummation permanently damaged a young woman's health, impaired a young man's physical and mental development, and produced sickly or stunted children. Therefore, eighteen came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and twenty and thirty the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to thirteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married Anne Hathaway when he was just eighteen might hold some significance.\n\nIn Verona, an early 14th-century house at Via Cappello no. 23, claiming to be the Capulets' has been turned into a tourist attraction but it is mostly empty. The real second name was in Italian Cappelletti, a noble family, and not Capuleti. Cappelletti were in the past members of the light cavalry of the Republic of Venice. They fought for it since the 13th century and they were originally from Dalmatia and Albania. It features the balcony, and in the small courtyard, a bronze statue of Juliet. It is one of the most visited sites in the town. The metal of its chest is worn bare due to a legend that if a person strokes the right breast of the statue, that person will have good fortune and luck in love.\n\nMany people write their names and the names of their beloved ones on the walls of the entrance, known as Juliet's wall. Many believe that writing on that place will make their love everlasting. After a restoration and cleaning of the building, it was intended that further writing should be on replaceable panels or white sheets placed outside the wall.\n\nIt is also a tradition to put small love letters on the walls (which is done by the thousands each year), which are regularly taken down by employees to keep the courtyard clean.\n\nAnother tradition that occurs in Juliet's courtyard is writing your name and that of your loved one on a lock and attaching it to a large ornamental gate in the back left. The gate is overwhelmed with locks that hold hope for lasting love. This tradition is seen throughout Europe on bridges and gates all over cities.\n\nSince the 1930s, letters addressed to Juliet keep arriving in Verona. As of 2010, more than 5,000 letters were received annually, three-quarters of which were from women. The largest single group of senders was American teenagers. The letters are read and replied to by local volunteers, organised since the 1980s in the \"Club di Giulietta\" (Juliet Club), which is financed by the City of Verona. The club has been the subject of a book by Lise and Ceil Friedman and is the setting for a 2008 book by Suzanne Harper and a 2010 USA movie, \"Letters to Juliet\".\n\nA number of famous actresses and some actors have portrayed the role of Juliet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Congregation subsequently granted diocesan bishops an indult to authorize specified priests and groups of the faithful who requested it, celebration of the Tridentine Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal promulgated by Pope John XXIII. The permitted Tridentine Masses were to be in full accord with the 1962 Missal and in Latin.\n\nThis was not the first time that such an indult had been granted. Directly after the promulgation of the Ordo Missae of 1970, Pope Paul VI issued the Agatha Christie indult, which gave permission to a large segment of priests in the United Kingdom to retain the usage of the Classical Roman Rite.\n\nAn important condition for granting the requests was \"that it be made publicly clear beyond all ambiguity that such priests and their respective faithful in no way share the positions of those who call in question the legitimacy and doctrinal exactitude of the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1970.\"\n\nDiocesan bishops refused many requests by people whom they considered not to have met this condition. But authorization was in fact granted either by diocesan bishops or directly by the Holy See to many priests, parishes and priestly societies, who could then use the older forms of the Roman Rite either exclusively or only on occasion. The priestly societies included the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney. These used the \"Tridentine\" liturgical books exclusively, not only for celebrating Mass but also for the other sacraments and rituals and for the Divine Office. Individual priests and communities belonging to religious institutes also received the same authorization. There were such cases among the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, the Institute of Saint Philip Neri, the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem, the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius, the monasteries of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux and Sainte Marie de la Garde. Various diocesan clergy also availed of the document's provision. See Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a list of priestly societies and religious institutes which celebrate the Tridentine Mass.\n\nThe Pope further expanded upon this with the motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\" of 1988, in which he exhorted the bishops to be generous in granting such a faculty for all the faithful who requested it. \"Ecclesia Dei\" supersedes \"Quattuor abhinc annos\" regarding the extent of the privilege.\n\nGroups such as the Society of St. Pius X, who maintained that they needed no permission to celebrate the Tridentine Mass decried the document and referred rather derisively to Masses celebrated with the \"Quattuor abhinc annos\" authorization as \"Indult Masses\". Several of these groups, such as the Society of St. Pius V, preferred to celebrate Mass according to pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal.\n\nThe view that use of the earlier form of the Roman liturgy had never been formally abrogated was authoritatively confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI, who declared that permission to use it (which can be granted by the priest in charge of the church) is required only for public celebration.\n\nPope Benedict XVI revoked the directives on 7 July 2007, replacing them with the norms enunciated in his motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1900794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900794", "title": "Seminoma", "text": "Seminoma\n\nA seminoma is a germ cell tumor of the testicle or, more rarely, the mediastinum or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a malignant neoplasm and is one of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.\n\nTesticular seminoma originates in the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules. About half of germ cell tumors of the testicles are seminomas. Treatment usually requires removal of one testicle. However, fertility usually isn't affected. All other sexual functions will remain intact.\n\nThe average age of diagnosis is between 35 and 50 years. This is about 5 to 10 years older than men with other germ cell tumors of the testes. In most cases, they produce masses that are readily felt on testicular self-examination; however, in up to 11 percent of cases, there may be no mass able to be felt, or there may be testicular atrophy. Testicular pain is reported in up to one fifth of cases. Low back pain may occur after metastasis to the retroperitoneum.\n\nSome cases of seminoma can present as a primary tumour outside the testis, most commonly in the mediastinum. In the ovary, the tumor is called a dysgerminoma, and in non-gonadal sites, particularly the central nervous system, it is called a germinoma.\n\nBlood tests may detect the presence of placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP, ALKP, ALPase, Alk Phos) in fifty percent of cases. However, Alk Phos cannot usefully stand alone as a marker for seminoma and contributes little to follow-up, due to its rise with smoking. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in some cases, but this correlates more to the presence of trophoblast cells within the tumour than to the stage of the tumour. A classical or pure seminoma by definition do not cause an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein . Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be the only marker that is elevated in some seminomas. The degree of elevation in the serum LDH has prognostic value in advanced seminoma.\n\nThe cut surface of the tumour is fleshy and lobulated, and varies in colour from cream to tan to pink. The tumour tends to bulge from the cut surface, and small areas of hemorrhage may be seen. These areas of hemorrhage usually correspond to trophoblastic cell clusters within the tumour.\n\nMicroscopic examination shows that seminomas are usually composed of either a sheet-like or lobular pattern of cells with a fibrous stromal network. The fibrous septa almost always contain focal lymphocyte inclusions, and granulomas are sometimes seen. The tumour cells themselves typically have abundant clear to pale pink cytoplasm containing abundant glycogen, which is demonstrable with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The nuclei are prominent and usually contain one or two large nucleoli, and have prominent nuclear membranes. Foci of syncytiotrophoblastic cells may be present in varied amounts. The adjacent testicular tissue commonly shows intratubular germ cell neoplasia, and may also show variable spermatocytic maturation arrest.\n\nPOU2AF1 and PROM1 have been proposed as possible markers.\n\nSpermatocytic seminomas are not considered a subtype of seminoma and unlike other germ cell tumours do not arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia.\n\nIntratesticular masses that appear suspicious on an ultrasound should be treated with an inguinal orchiectomy. The pathology of the removed testicle and spermatic cord indicate the presence of the seminoma and assist in the staging. Tumors with both seminoma and nonseminoma elements or that occur with the presence of AFP should be treated as nonseminomas. Abdominal CT or MRI scans as well as chest imaging are done to detect for metastasis. The analysis of tumor markers also helps in staging.\n\nThe preferred treatment for most forms of stage 1 seminoma is active surveillance. Stage 1 seminoma is characterized by the absence of clinical evidence of metastasis. Active surveillance consists of periodic history and physical examinations, tumor marker analysis, and radiographic imaging. Around 85-95% of these cases will require no further treatment. Modern radiotherapy techniques as well as one or two cycles of single-agent carboplatin have been shown to reduce the risk of relapse, but carry the potential of causing delayed side effects. Regardless of treatment strategy, stage 1 seminoma has nearly a 100% cure rate.\n\nStage 2 seminoma is indicated by the presence of retroperitoneal metastasis. Cases require radiotherapy or, in advanced cases, combination chemotherapy. Large residual masses found after chemotherapy may require surgical resection. Second-line treatment is the same as for nonseminomas.\n\nStage 3 seminoma is characterized by the presence of metastasis outside the retroperitoneum—the lungs in \"good risk\" cases or elsewhere in \"intermediate risk\" cases. This is treated with combination chemotherapy. Second-line treatment follows nonseminoma protocols.\n"}

They play at Wright's Meadow on Leighton Road, in the Parish of Stanbridge. \nIn 2020-21 the 1st XV will play in London 1 North - a league at the 6th tier of the English rugby union system - following their promotion from Midlands 2 East (South) at the end of 2019-20.\n\nThe club was founded in 1934 with the enthusiastic support of the town's Cedars Grammar School with which it has always maintained a close support. The club flourished during those early years, playing its home matches at the Cricket Club's Bell Close headquarters, but like many others, was disbanded with the outbreak of World War II. Many of the founder members did not return from the hostilities and probably in consequence the club was not reformed until mid-way through season 1948–49. Several successful seasons followed, with the club supported by local schools and locally based service personnel, but fell into decline and was disbanded at the end of the 1955–56 season. Rugby during this immediate post-war period was played at the Capshill Meadow on the Hockliffe Road which is just big enough for one pitch.\n\nThe club of today arguably owes its existence to the enthusiasm of a 19-year-old Howard Ansdell who initiated the reforming of the club in time for the 1958–59 season and to local businessman Geoff Wright who steered the club into erecting its first clubhouse in 1962, and in 1965 to the purchase of the Capshill Meadow ground. Proceeds from the sale of the ground in 1973 established the splendid facilities we now enjoy. The move to Stanbridge Road occurred at a time when the Town was expanding and with many new players available to the club, was able to attract much stronger fixtures for its Senior XV. The transformation of Cedars Grammar to a comprehensive did not stop the flow of good rugby players to the club as rugby remained the primary winter sport at the school. Thanks to Cedars, Leighton was always able to punch above its weight for a club from a relatively small town. Each of the club's six sides would always have a good representation of Old Cedarians.\n\nAdmirably fed by a regular intake of players from particularly the Cedars but also the Vandyke Schools, Buzzards grew in stature so that by the 1970s they had a strong fixture list and almost always finished a season with more wins than losses. During this time the club built a strong bond with the club from Leighton Buzzard's French twin town Coulommiers in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Ile de France region. On one memorable occasion the club also stepped in to host top Romanian club CSA Steaua București when bad weather had forced the cancellation of one of their tour matches. At that time Romanian rugby was a force to be reckoned with and if not close to acceptance into the then Five Nations Championship, then they ought to have been as they would score reasonably regular victories over France, Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe club's golden period could be traced from the early-mid 80s to mid 90s. Prior to the RFU's implementation of a national league structure, the only measure of success for junior clubs like Leighton were the cup competitions of the RFU constituent county bodies. Winning the County Cup enabled a club to gain entry to the following season's National Knockout Cup and the chance to have a tilt at one of the big clubs. In Leighton Buzzard's case this came in the shape of the East Midlands Cup for clubs based in Bedfordshire and Northants. In 1985–86, Paul Whiting became the first Buzzards skipper to lift the Cup when Peterborough were beaten in the final. The draw for the following season's National Cup, then called the John Player Cup, saw them paired with Birmingham, at the time a club on the cusp of first class status who were later to become Birmingham & Solihull R.F.C.. Led by David Yirrell, Buzzards produced the upset of the round winning 20–11. Buzzards fell at the next hurdle to Lichfield but with confidence brimming the season culminated with the retention of the East Midlands Cup when Northampton Trinity were beaten at Franklin's Gardens.\n\nThe following season, 1987–88 the inaugural season of league rugby, saw Buzzards placed in Midlands Division 2 (East). They also made their second appearance in the John Player Cup as a result of their County Cup win. Again they conquered higher ranked opposition in the first round when Derby, then of National Division 4 (North), were beaten 10–7 in a close encounter at Stanbridge Road (the name Wright's Meadow was still to be coined). The second round draw paired them with first class opposition in the form of nearby Bedford Blues, again at home. Led by John Orwin who was to captain England later that season, and also including former and future Buzzard stalwarts in Pete Ellam and John Davidson, Bedford had to work hard to subdue a spirited Buzzards effort. Buzzards conceded just one try in a 24–6 defeat in front of probably the largest crowd to assemble at the ground. Later that season their attempt to land a hat-trick of East Midlands Cup wins was dashed at the last when they fell to Stockwood Park in the final. A fifth place in their first league campaign was a disappointing return for a season that had started with such promise. However this disappointment was tempered slightly by the RFU's decision to expand the entry to the following season's National Cup, now to be called the Pilkington Cup, meaning that Leighton would be included as East Midlands Cup Runners-Up.\n\nIn 1988–89 with John Fraser now installed as skipper, the second season of league rugby was a successful one as they finished as champions of Midlands 2 (East) to bring about what became a five-season stay in Midlands Division 1 (now named National League 3 Midlands). At the time this was the fifth tier of the National League structure. Their National Cup heroics didn't quite reach their previous heights as they made an 18–12 first round exit to Hereford.\n\nIn 1993–94 the club suffered their first relegation dropping back into what was now Midlands Division 2 (the East/West split having been discarded for 1994–95). In terms of silverware the Club now embarked on probably its most successful season. Under the captaincy of Ian Smith, the league title was secured with a win in the last-day winner-takes-all clash against Broadstreet at Wright's Meadow. Not only was there the league success but the Bedfordshire Cup was regained and the East Midlands Cup won for a third time with local rivals Stockwood Park vanquished in both finals.\n\nThere followed the club's 60th anniversary season which began with celebration matches against Aylesbury, who had been the club's first opponents in 1934, and a London Wasps XV. The East Midlands Cup win of the previous April had also given them another Pilkington Cup excursion. Again they were paired with Birmingham & Solihull. Though this time they had home advantage, history was not to be repeated and their campaign faltered at the first hurdle as they went down 29–11. By now, with the league system having taken deep root very quickly, a club's position within the league structure was now seen as all important with the Pilkington Cup now seen as a diversion, albeit a pleasant one with some kudos if early rounds could be successfully negotiated. Buzzards achieved their primary aim in their first season back in Midlands 1 by consolidating its place with a 10th-place finish in the 13-team table.\n\nThe club's most successful league campaign came in the 1997–98 when Carl Siddon led them to a mid-table finish in Midlands Division 1. The following season, however, saw a sharp decline in playing strength and performance and inevitably relegation followed. The club has not been at Level 5 since.\n\nToday, the club fields four senior adult senior sides, in addition to this the club also field; Veterans (over 35's), a Colts XV and since 1995 a Ladies XV. The club relies heavily on developing players from within its own ranks and is very proud of its long-established Mini/Junior section which currently boasts a membership of approximately 200 children aged between 5 and 17 years. Never having had a large benefactor may have meant that Buzzard's league position has slipped, but it has meant that the club still belongs to the town and the members and retains the \"club feel\". The 1st XV starting line up and subs for the side's last home League match of the successful 2013–14 season contained 11 players whose fathers had also played for the club.\n\nSigns that their star might be in the ascendent once more came in 2006–07 when the Colts XV swept the board winning the East Midlands League and Cup competitions along with the Bedfordshire Cup. The side was captained by Ryan Fraser emulating his father John in lifting silverware in the name of LBRFC. It is hoped that a majority of those Colts players will filter into the senior setup and possibly bring on another era similar to that of the late '80s and early '90s. Back then however, rugby union was an amateur game. Buzzards only had to contend with Northampton Saints and Bedford to keep their players. Now in the \"open era\", the pendulum of playing strength and more tellingly, financial muscle, has swung so that Luton and Ampthill for long the subordinates, are now also potential predators.\n\nStill, from those humble beginnings in 1934 LBRFC now provides a sporting centre with which the town has every right to be proud. However, as an organisation, fully aware that standing still is not an option, the club's committee are actively looking at ways of improving the facilities for the playing of sport and enjoyment of associated social activities.\n\n1st XV:\n\n2nd XV:\n\n\n4th XV:\n\n\nColts:\n\nUnder 17's:\n\nThe following players all had top level experience either before or after representing Leighton Buzzard.\n\n'Matthew Barnett-Vincent joined the club as a 16-year-old England age group international Hooker and made several appearances for the 1st XV splitting his time with Bedford Blues who he made his 1st team debut for aged 17 years on Boxing day 1992. Matthew played age group international (up to U21) and club rugby with Bedford for the next few seasons and was highly thought of, forging an impressive international front row partnership with future England captain Phil Vickery and Phil Greening (playing at prop)the game at this time was still amateur and despite having an offer to join Harlequins Matthew became increasingly disillusioned with the sport, after suffering several injuries he quit playing to concentrate on building a career in his Fathers engineering company. Several years later Matthew became a semi professional motorcycle racer competing in National Superstock aboard a Yamaha R1, enjoying some success at National level he was signed to Global Motorport Marketing, bad luck and poor finances plagued the team and he rode his last race, which he won at Snetterton, Norfolk in 2003.He returned to the game and played the 2007/8 season with Pataya Panthers in Thailand alongside several ex international Australian and Kiwi players, on his return to the UK Matthew once again returned to Leighton Buzzard and on his retirement had represented the club a total of 43 times. Matthew now runs CHS Electrical Services in Leighton Buzzard and is involved in coaching junior players at Buckingham RUFC.\n\nStuart Maxwell joined following a stint with Bedford having played previously for New Brighton and Richmond. Brother of Andy, who won 7 England caps between 1975 and 1978, Stuart notched up some notable achievements of his own. In 1972 he scored two tries for the North-West Counties in their historic 16–14 win over New Zealand at Workington, the first time an English regional side had beaten the All Blacks. In 1975 having moved on to Bedford, he bagged another touchdown against international opposition when representing the Southern Counties in their match against Australia during the latter's 1975−76 UK tour. He was also an accomplished Sevens exponent having been a member of the Richmond side that won the Middlesex Sevens in 1974 and 1975.\n\nJohn Surguy joined the club having completed two spells at Northampton Saints. He continued his prolific points scoring habit displayed at Franklins Gardens and previously at junior level for nearby Bletchley. Through his time at each club, Surguy had lived in Leighton and his town club was grateful he eventually made his way there. He featured prominently in the East Midlands Cup wins of 1986 and 1987. He also represented East Midlands in the Mobbs Memorial Match against the Barbarians whilst at Northampton.\n\nChris Gibbons, though never leaving the Leighton Buzzard club did score the achievement of representing East Midlands on more than one occasion in the annual Mobbs Memorial Match against the Barbarians. At the time it was extremely rare for a player outwith Northampton Saints and Bedford Blues to be invited into the East Midlands side for the match, especially if that player was plying his trade at a junior club. Gibbons was one of the very few to buck the trend.\n\nPete Ellam spent a number of seasons at Bedford and was a regular during the latter's Centenary Season of 1985–86. He returned to Buzzards and was 1st XV captain for 1991–92 season.\n\nJohn Davidson arrived from Bedford in 1988−89 for the season following the Buzzards v. Bedford John Player Cup clash. An England 'B' cap, Davidson had been a stalwart with Moseley for whom he played in the 1982 John Player Cup Final at Twickenham when they shared the trophy with Gloucester following a 12–12 draw after extra time.\n\nWhen it comes to international representation the club can point to recent 1st XV skipper Bert Yirrell who when a member of the club's Junior section represented England at Under-16 level.\n\nNeil Wise is the club's only player to win senior international recognition. Having moved to the Grand Duchy with work in the late-'90s, Wise represented the Luxembourg national side on a number of occasions including Rugby World Cup qualifiers.\n\nHenry Peck was selected for England Schools whilst at the club. He now plays for Cambridge in National Division 1, the third tier of the RFU league structure\n\nGeorge Messum represented England Students whilst studying at Loughborough University. He also played for Northampton Saints and Bedford before winning a Blue for Oxford University in the 2014 Varsity Match when the Dark Blues scored their record win (43−6) and in doing so notched a fifth consecutive win for the first time in the fixture. He was elected OURFC captain for the 2015−16 season but was prevented from taking part in Oxford's record sixth consecutive Varsity Match victory owing to new eligibility rules surrounding degree courses. He returned to win another Blue in the 2019 match. He currently plays for Old Elthamians in National Division 1, tier 3 of the League setup.\n\n"}

Previous to his appointment to the epicopacy, he served as a diocesan priest and later vicar general of the Diocese of Oakland in California. He is the first person born in Hawaii to lead the Roman Catholic community of the Hawaiian Islands. He is also the second person of Portuguese ancestry to serve the community as its ordinary.\n\nAs Bishop of Honolulu, Silva has his liturgical and canonical seat or \"cathedra\" at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace; he also has a \"cathedra\" at the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus in Kapālama. At both of the above cathedral churches, rectors and parochial vicars administer the daily liturgical and pastoral work. The bishop's administrative offices are located in the Bishop Street chancery.\n\nSilva was born on the island of O'ahu to electrician and refrigeration mechanic Richard Silva and homemaker Catherine Alves Silva at Saint Francis Hospital in Liliha. The great grandson of immigrants from the Azores, Silva was baptized at Saint Anthony Church in Kailua but moved to California during his first year of life. He attended Saint John the Baptist School in San Lorenzo and together with Frank De Lima at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland. Convinced of a calling to Holy Orders, Silva spent his undergraduate years at Saint Joseph College Seminary in Mountain View where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree and Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park where he later obtained a Master of Divinity degree. Silva studied the Spanish language in Cuernavaca, Mexico in 1975 and 1978. During his first sabbatical leave, he studied at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, Italy in 1991.\n\nAfter completing theological studies, Silva was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Oakland on May 2, 1975 by Floyd Lawrence Begin, Bishop of Oakland.\n\nSilva served as associate pastor and pastor at nine parish churches throughout the Diocese of Oakland: Saint Bernard Church from 1975 to 1978, Our Lady of the Rosary Church from 1978 to 1979, Saint Bede Church in Hayward from 1983 to 1984, Saint Peter Martyr Church in Pittsburg from 1984 to 1986 and Saint Anthony Church in Oakland from 1986 to 1991.

Employing parish clustering, he served as pastor of two parishes at a time. He oversaw the merger of two parishes into one several times.\n\nSilva served under various leadership positions in the Diocese of Oakland. While associate pastor and pastor of various parish churches, Silva also served as diocesan vocations director from 1979 to 1983. He recruited religious brothers and priests for the Diocese of Oakland. In 2003, Allen Henry Vigneron, Bishop of Oakland, appointed Silva his vicar general and moderator of the diocesan curia.\n\nAs vicar general and moderator of the diocesan curia, Silva was instrumental in the planning for the construction of the Cathedral of Christ the Light, the replacement of the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989.\n\nSilva's consecration as bishop and installation as prelate over the Hawaiian Islands occurred on July 21, 2005 at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center Arena. It was the first joint consecration and installation ceremony in Hawaii; former bishops had already been consecrated on the mainland prior to their installation. It was also the first such ceremony held at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center since 1982.\n\nSilva was consecrated by William Joseph Levada, principal consecrator, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Archbishop of the metropolitan archdiocese of San Francisco to which the Diocese of Honolulu is suffragan. The co-consecrators were Allen Henry Vigneron, Oakland ordinary, and his predecessor, John Stephen Cummins, Bishop Emeritus of Oakland. Several other bishops were in attendance: Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo Higuera, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States; Msgr. Anthony Apuron, Archbishop of Hagatna in Guam; Msgr. Tod Brown, Bishop of Orange; Msgr. Daniel F. Walsh, Bishop of Santa Rosa in California; Msgr. Tomas Camacho, Bishop of Chalan Kanoa (Saipan); Msgr. Quinn Weitzel, Bishop of Pago Pago, American Samoa; Msgr. Wilfredo D. Manpalaz, Bishop of Tagum, Philippines; Msgr. Juan De Dios Pueblo, Bishop of Butuan, Philippines; Msgr. William Skurla, Eparch of the Eparchy of Van Nuys in Phoenix, Arizona; Msgr. John C. Wester, Auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco; Msgr. George Thomas, Bishop of Helena; Msgr. Joseph Estabrook of the Military Ordinariate of the United States; Msgr. Richard Garcia, Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento; Msgr. Patricio Alo, Bishop of Mati in the Philippines; and Msgr. Stephen E. Blaire, Bishop of Stockton. Roger Cardinal Mahony, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles was expected to attend the event, but was unable to attend due to airplane problems in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Episcopal coat-of-arms for Bishop Silva was designed by Father Quang Dong and Thanh Dong of the Diocese of Oakland. \"Silva\" means \"forest\" in Portuguese. The sinister impalement contains three trees in the \"forest\"; the kukui (\"Aleurites mollucana\") on the right, symbolizing Hawai'i, the birthplace of the bishop, his parents and grandparents. The kukui yields an oil with healing properties that also provides light; the oak (\"Quercus alba\") on the left, symbolizing Oakland (\"Quercopolitana\") where Bishop Silva grew up and where he served as a priest for 30 years; and the cross - the tree of life - in the center, with olive leaves symbolizing Malia O Ka Malu (Mary, Queen of Peace), patroness of the Diocese of Honolulu (Honolulu is translated from Hawaiian as \"peaceful harbor\") under whose protection Bishop Silva entrusts his episcopal ministry. Bishop Silva's episcopal motto, \"\"Witness to Jesus\"\" derives from Revelation 19:10.\n\nIn April 2020, Bishop Silva announced during a Sunday mass that the Diocese of Honolulu was paying millions to settle prior sex abuse cases. Silva also acknowledged that the Diocese was still facing a large of number of sex abuse lawsuits as well.\n\nSilva assumes the episcopacy as successor to Francis Xavier DiLorenzo, fourth Bishop of Honolulu. He was the first Bishop of Honolulu to have originally come from Hawaii.\n\nDiLorenzo dealt with priests accused of abusing minors. Issues facing Silva upon assuming the episcopacy include the decline of vocations and consequent difficulties in staffing parishes, and sex abuse scandals.\n\nHe was a principal promoter for the causes of sainthood for St. Damien of Moloka'i and Blessed Marianne of Moloka'i.\n\nOne of his first acts as bishop-elect was to travel on pilgrimage to Kalaupapa on the island of Moloka'i on May 19, to pay homage to then-Blessed Damien and then-Blessed Marianne. Marianne had only been beatified and raised to the title of \"Blessed\" by Pope Benedict XVI a few days earlier on May 14. Speaking of his pilgrimage Silva said, \"I will let that empower me in my ministry to the people of Hawai'i. Damien has been my hero since I was a boy.\" Silva's great grandfather was a patient of the leper colony.\n\nAfter the 2009 Canonisation of Father Damien and the 2012 Canonisation of Mother Marianne, Bishop Silva had the unique distinction of being the only Bishop in American history who had two people from his diocese canonised during his episcopate. (Although the Archdiocese of Philadelphia also has two canonised members, they were during the episcopates of two different archbishops.)\n\nMsgr. Silva was inducted into the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 2005 and holds the rank of Grand Officer. He is also a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\n\nIn June 2013, a special ceremony was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, inducting him into the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, where he holds the rank of Knight Companion. He had especially been cited for having \"gained the respect and admiration of the High Chiefs, Chief, Officers, Mamo Hawaii and Na Wahine Hui o Kamehameha I for his ecumenical spirit of aloha, kindness sensitivity to our island ways and for his love of the Hawaiian culture and all the cultures for people from around the world who call Hawaii home.\" \n\nMsgr. Silva first ordination was Brother Johnathan Hurrell, SS.CC., to the priesthood on November 25, 2005, at Saint Patrick Church in Kaimuki, Honolulu.\n\n"}

According to legend, the son of Aydın's governor in the Ottoman period, fell in love with a young woman from Pazarköy but was rejected by the girl's father. The young man later named the town Nazlı Ili (Nazlı's Home) after his loved one. The 17th century traveller Evliya Çelebi held that the town was named for the capriciousness (\"naz\") of the local women in this wealthy town. Or it could have been the name of a family of Oghuz Turks that settled here.\n\nNazilli was still called Nazli by the British as of 1920.\n\nThese people practiced weaving and thus planted cotton in the area for this purpose. The Oghuz Turks were succeeded by the Anatolian beyliks of Menteşe (in 1280) and then Aydinids.\n\nIn 1390 Bayezid I brought the area into the Ottoman Empire. At this time the town comprised two villages, Cuma Yeri (Friday Square) and Pazarköy (Weekday Market). The town was only later referred to as Nazliköy. In 1402 Tamerlane defeated Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara and took control of the Aegean region, giving the Nazilli area back to the Aydinid family. it was quickly recovered for the Ottomans by Sultan Murat II.\n\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence Nazilli was occupied by Greek forces and came under Turkish control in September 5, 1922.\n\nNazilli stands on the Menderes River and much of the district is in the Menderes valley, full of citrus trees, olives and figs as well as cotton, wheat and other crops.\n\nHistorically Nazilli was a producer of lignite. As of 1914, they were producing large quantities which was managed by a company from the United States. The lignite, in 1920, was described as being \"deplorably bad,\" despite demand for it to be exported to Smyrna. Just north of Nazilli, in 1920, were reported emery mines, too.\n\nNazilli today has a population of 109,800 (according to the 2007 census).\n\nThe Basmane-Nazilli Regional railway service runs between İzmir and Nazilli.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 20, 2000. In the episode, Homer gets in trouble with PBS after confessing he does not have $10,000 to give them for their pledge drive, and ends up a missionary on a South Pacific island. It was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the final episode written by Ron Hauge.\n\nIn an attempt to end a pledge drive which interrupts a favorite show of his on PBS (a Thames Television British sitcom entitled \"Do Shut Up\"), Homer pledges $10,000 to the network. Homer is applauded for saving the network, but it quickly becomes apparent that he does not have the money, prompting pledge drive host Betty White and a mob of characters and personalities from various PBS shows (including Fred Rogers, Yo-Yo Ma, the Teletubbies, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and Elmo) to chase him through the streets. Reverend Lovejoy saves Homer after he runs into the church and claims sanctuary. Reverend Lovejoy gets Homer past the mob by hiding him in a bag disguised as a sack of children's letters to God. Lovejoy puts Homer on a cargo plane to the South Pacific, where he will become a missionary in Micronesia despite Homer's lack of religious faith and ignorance of his professed Christianity, the latter to the point he mistakenly refers to Jesus as \"Jeebus.\"\n\nHomer calls back to Marge in Springfield with a radio, during which he promotes Bart to \"the man of the house\", Lisa to \"boy\", Maggie to the \"brainy girl\" and the toaster to \"Maggie\", making Marge a consultant. Bart replaces Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where Mr. Burns criticizes Homer's record and, not recognizing whom he is talking to, pokes Bart with a stick. After coming home from a hard day at work, Bart agrees to take Marge out for dinner one night.\n\nHomer arrives on the island and he meets Qtoktok and Ak. He also meets a native girl who acts and sounds exactly like Lisa that he names \"Lisa Jr.\" At first, he is so desperate that he drops to the ground writhing and crying \"Oh God!\" repeatedly (which the natives all imitate, following his example). The natives are first portrayed as noble savages, ignorant of and unspoiled by North American civilization. Homer eventually begins trying to teach them about religion, but realizing that he knows nothing about it, he tries something new and decides to build a casino on the island, which he names \"The Lucky Savage\". It introduces alcohol, gambling, and violence to the island, and ruins the natives' virtuous way of life.\n\nAfter the failure of the casino, Homer builds a chapel in penance, but he and Lisa Jr. ring the bell too loudly, causing an earthquake that releases a river of lava. The chapel, carrying Homer and Lisa Jr., starts to sink into the lava. As the two are about to meet their deaths, the scene cuts to another pledge drive; this time, however, the drive is for the Fox network. It is revealed that the show is in danger of cancellation, while the entire network is facing financial hardship. Various Fox show personalities are manning the phones (including Thurgood Stubbs from \"The PJs,\" agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully from \"The X Files,\" Hank Hill from \"King of the Hill\" and Bender from \"Futurama\"), joined by a cranky Rupert Murdoch and hosted again by Betty White, who entreats the viewers to help keep \"crude, low-brow programming\", such as \"Family Guy\", on air. Bart calls in and pledges a $10,000 donation. Murdoch remarks that Bart has saved the network, to which he replies \"Wouldn't be the first time\".\n\nIn the beginning of the episode Homer is watching a program called \"Do Shut Up\", described as \"a delicious British sitcom about a hard-drinking yet loving family of soccer hooligans\". British English expressions terms used in the sitcom include \"noggin\", \"wanker\", and \"soddin\".\n\nThe song playing when the program starts is \"No Feelings\" by the Sex Pistols. When Homer defaults on his financial pledge of support to PBS, references seen to characters from other programs that pursue him through the town include Fred Rogers, Yo-Yo Ma, the Teletubbies, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Elmo and Garrison Keillor.\n\nWhen Marge calls Homer on the ham radio, she says \"Hello? Is there anybody in there?\" reminiscent to the intro of \"Comfortably Numb\" by Pink Floyd.\n\nWhen Homer arrives in the island, a butterfly gets into Homer's skin and moves to his brain, reminiscing a scene from \"The Mummy\".\n\nReception of the episode has been mostly positive. \n\nJeff Cotton of \"The Observer\" characterizes the episode as \"A Classic\". Cotton notes: \"There's a big finish, and one of those jokes at Fox's expense you know they wouldn't allow if The Simpsons wasn't their biggest cash cow.\" \n\nIn a review of the episode for \"The Gazette\", Alex Strachan writes: \"Missionary: Impossible ... may not be the funniest Simpsons episode ever made. But it has some of the funniest lines about TV.\" Strachan quotes Homer's description of the television program \"Do Shut Up\" to Bart: \"If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker,\" as one of the funniest moments in the episode, however the line was cut from the British broadcast as \"wanker\" is a swear word in the UK. \n\nWriting in his review of the episode for \"The Simpsons\" 11th season DVD release, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide is critical of an \"inane\" choice by the producers to have Homer refer to Jesus as \"Jeebus\". However Jacobson gives the episode a positive review overall: \"Highlighted by a fun turn from Betty White, the PBS segment amuses, and the pieces with Homer on the island do nicely as well. Despite 'Jeebus', this becomes arguably Season 11’s best episode.\"\n\n\"Missionary: Impossible\" was also named the best episode of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" by IGN writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They highlighted scenes \"such as the building of the 'Lucky Savage' casino and the destruction of Homer's chapel by an earthquake and a river of lava,\" but also noted that \"Some of the episode's best humor is back in Springfield, after Homer makes Bart the man of the house — as Bart fills in for Homer at the nuclear plant, Mr. Burns berates ‘Homer’ for his poor performance record, gets tired of talking and ends up just poking Bart with a stick. Betty White also gives a great guest performance as herself, hosting a PBS telethon and ridiculing those viewers who watch but don't send in contributions.\"\n\nThe episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it is \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.\" Some questions asked in the courses include: \"What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" mentions how Homer is a \"good Catholic\" according to an article in \"L’Osservatore Romano\" and offers a clip from this episode in which Homer \"memorably\" declared, “I’m no missionary, I don’t even believe in Jebus!” seconds before uttering the despairing plea, “Save me, Jebus!”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900847", "title": "Carley State Park", "text": "Carley State Park\n\nCarley State Park is a state park of Minnesota, United States, about northeast of Rochester and about south of Plainview in Wabasha County. It is used for picnics, camping, hiking, and other outdoor recreation. It is known for the bluebell flowers that bloom there every spring.\n\nIt is located in the Driftless Area of Minnesota. This is an area that escaped glaciation during the last ice age, i.e. the Wisconsinian glaciation.\n\nBeginning 450 million years ago, a shallow sea covered much of North America, including what is now southeastern Minnesota. Layers of sediment, hundreds of feet thick, were deposited on the sea bed and became cemented together to form the limestone bedrock. Although this area was not covered by the last glaciers, the effect of that period on the landscape is striking. Glacial action caused the formation of huge amounts of powdered rock and fine particles from its constant grinding. These fine particles, blown by the wind after the retreat of the glacier, were deposited over southeastern Minnesota in a thick blanket of soil known as loess. The surrounding rich farmland is a testament to the benefits of this soil type.\n\nThe park's hardwood forest and adjacent agricultural land is home to mammalian species of white-tailed deer, two species of fox, beavers, and coyotes. Birds that inhabit here are pileated woodpeckers, great horned owls, and many migratory songbirds.\n\nDakota Native Americans once hunted, farmed and gathered wild food in and around the Whitewater River Valley. They gave the Whitewater River its name because the river turned a murky white color in the spring as high water eroded the light colored clay of the valley floor. In 1851, the United States government and the Dakota tribe signed a treaty that opened most of southern Minnesota for European settlers. The nearest settlement to the park, Plainview, was named for the large, upland fields of prairie grass that surrounded the river valley. The land for the park was donated to the State of Minnesota in 1948 by State Senator James A. Carley and the Ernestina Bolt family in hopes of preserving an outstanding grove of native white pines. In 1957, a severe hailstorm ravaged the trees. The stand of white pines towers in the steep, rugged valley of the Whitewater River, opposite the picnic area, and can be seen from the trail observation platform.\n\n"}
{"id": "1900851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900851", "title": "Resolvin", "text": "Resolvin\n\nResolvins are specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from omega-3 fatty acids, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as well as docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and clupanodonic acid. As autacoids similar to hormones acting on local tissues, resolvins are under preliminary research for their involvement in promoting restoration of normal cellular function following the inflammation that occurs after tissue injury. Resolvins belong to a class of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites termed specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs).\n\nResolvins (Rvs) fall into several sub-classes based on the straight chain PUFA from which they are formed and/or a unique aspect of their structure. The Resolvin Ds (RvDs) are metabolites of the 22-carbon PUFA, DHA (i.e. 4\"Z\",7\"Z\",10\"Z\",13\"Z\",16\"Z\",19\"Z\")-docosahexaenoic acid); the resolvin Es (RvEs) are metabolites of the 20-carbon PUFA, EPA (i.e. 5\"Z\",8\"Z\",11\"Z\",14\"Z\",17\"Z\"-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin D (RvDs) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, osbond acid (i.e. 4\"Z\",7\"Z\",10\"Z\",13\"Z\",16\"Z\"-docosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin D (RvD) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, clupanodonic acid (i.e. 7\"Z\",10\"Z\",13\"Z\",16\"Z\",19\"Z\")-docosapentaenoic acid); and the resolvin Ts (RvTs) are metabolites of clupanodonic acid that, in contrast to (RvDs (all of which possess a 17\"S\"-hydroxyl residue), possess a 17\"R\"-hydroxyl residue. Certain isomers of RvDs are termed aspirin-triggered resolvin Ds (AT-RvDs) because their synthesis is initiated by a drug-modified COX2 enzyme to form 17(\"R\")-hydroxyl rather than 17(\"S\")-hydroxyl residue of the ReVEs; however, an as yet unidentified cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) may also forms this 17(\"R\")-hydroxy intermediate and thereby contribute to the production of AT-RvEs. All of the cited resolvins except the RvDss are metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nThe following oxygenase enzymes may be responsible for metabolizing PUFA to resolvins: 15-lipoxygenase-1 (i.e. ALOX15), possibly 15-lipoxygenase-2 (i.e. ALOX15B), 5-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX5), cyclooxygenase-2 (i.e. COX-2), and certain Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases.\n\nRvDs are poly-hydroxyl metabolites of DHA. To date, six RvDs, which vary in the number, position, and chirality of their hydroxyl residues as well as the position and cis-trans isomerism of their 6 double bonds, have been described. These are: RvD1 (7\"S\",8\"R\",17\"S\"-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD2 (7\"S\",16\"R\",17\"S\"-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD3 (4\"S\",7\"R\",17\"S\"-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD4 (4\"S\",5,17\"S\"-trihydroxy-DHA; chirality at position 5 not yet determined), RvD5 (7\"S\",17\"S\"-dihydroxy-DHA), and RvD6 (4\"S\",17\"S\"-dihydroxy-DHA). (The structures of these RvDs are further defined at Specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Resolvins). These metabolites are formed by a wide range of cells and tissues by the initial metabolism of DHA to 7\"S\"-hydroperoxy-DHA and 4\"S\"-hydroperoxy-DHA by a 15-lipoxygenase (either ALOX15 or possibly ALOX15B) followed by the further metabolism of the two intermediates by ALOX5 to their 17-hydroperoxy derivatives; these di-hydroperoxy products are further altered to the cited RvDs by these oxygenases or by non-enzymatic reactions and the conversion of their peroxy residues ubiquitous cellular peroxidases.\nRvEs are di- or tri-hydroxyl metabolites of EPA. To date, four RvEs have been described: RvE1 (5\"S\",12\"R\",18\"R\"-trihydroxy-EPA), 18\"S\"-Rv1 (5\"S\",12\"R\",18\"S\"-trihydroxy-EPA), RvE2 (5\"S\",18\"R\"-dihydroxy-EPA), and RvE3 (17\"R\",18\"R/S\"-dihydroxy-EPA). (Structures of the RvEs are further defined at Specialized proresolving mediators#EPA-derived Resolvins.) Resolvin Es are formed in manner similar to AT resolving Ts. COX-2 modified in activity by aspirin or atorvastatin or, alternatively, a microbial or possibly mammalian cytochrome P450 monoxygenase metabolizes EPA to its 18\"R\"-hydroperoxy derivative; this intermediate is then further metabolized by ALOX5 to a 5,6 epoxide which is hydrolyzed enzymatically or non-enzymatically to RvE1 and 18\"S\"-RvE1 or reduced to RvE2; alternatively the 18\"R\"-hydroperoxide is converted to the 17\"R\",18\"S\" vicinal diol product, RvE3.\n\nHuman platelets pretreated with aspirin or atorvastatin metabolize the omega-3 DPA, clupanodonic acid (DPA) by aspirin-treated or atorvastatin-treated COX2 to a 13\"S\"-hydroperoxy intermediate (aspirin and atorvastatin change the activity of COX2 from a cyclooxygenase to an hydroxyperoxidase-forming enzyme. The intermediate is then passed to nearby human neutrophils which metabolize it, probably by ALOX5 enzyme activity, to four poly-hydroxyl metabolites: RvT1 (7,13\"R\",20-trihydroxy-DPA); RvT2 (7,8,13\"R\"-trihydroxy-DPA); RvT3 (7,12,13\"R\"-trihydroxy-8\"Z\",10\"E\",14\"E\",16\"Z\",19\"Z\"-DPA) and RvT4 (7,13\"R\"-dihydroxy-DPA). Subsequent studies found that these four RvTs are also formed by mixtures of human neutrophils and vascular endothelium cells and, additionally, are detected in the infected tissues of rodents and humans.\n\nFollowing tissue injury, the inflammatory response is a protective process to promote restoration of the tissue to homeostasis. Resolution of inflammation involves various specialized lipid mediators, including resolvins. Resolvins are under laboratory research for their potential to act through G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs): 1) RvD1 and AT-RvD1 act through the Formyl peptide receptor 2, which is also activated by certain lipoxins and is therefore often termed the ALX/FPR2 receptor; 2) RvD1, AT-RVD1, RvD3, AT-RvD3, and RvD5 act through the GPR32 receptor which is now also termed the RVD1 receptor; 3) RvD2 acts through the GPR18 receptor also now termed the RvD2 receptor; and 4) RvE1 and the 18(\"S\") analog of RvE1 are full activators while RvE2 is a partial activator of the CMKLR1 receptor. All of these receptors activate their parent cells through standard GPR-mobilized pathways. RvE1, 18(\"S\")-RvE1, and RvE2 inhibit the Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 which is the receptor for inflammation-promoting PUFA metabolites such as LTB4 and the \"R\" stereoisomer of 12-HETE; by inhibiting the action of these pro-inflammatory mediators.\n\nResolvin metabolites of EPA, DHA, and DPA and the maresin and protectin D1 metabolites of DHA are under basic research for their potential influences on inflammation. One human study reported no increase in urine or plasma resolvin content after consumption of fish oil compared to a non-omega-3 oil, either before or after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide known to induce an inflammatory reaction. Preliminary studies in people with cancer, kidney disease or cystic fibrosis while receiving dietary PUFA or fish oil supplements indicated improvement of inflammation biomarkers, possibly resulting from resolvins.\n"}

It operated under that name from 1873 to 1893. Prior to 1873 it was known as the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad, which had been formed by several smaller railroads dating back to 1846. After bankruptcy in 1893, the New York and New England Railroad was reorganized and became known as the New England Railroad before its 1898 lease to the competing New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Today, most of the original New York and New England lines have been abandoned; however a portion in Massachusetts is now part of the MBTA's Franklin Line providing commuter rail service to South Station in Boston. The Connecticut Southern Railroad operates freight service on a small portion of the former NY&NE line near East Hartford and Manchester, Connecticut. Other portions in Connecticut and Rhode Island have been converted to rail trails.\n\nPan Am Southern operates between New Britain and Waterbury. The portion east of New Britain has been converted to a busway.\n\nThe corridor from Providence, Rhode Island west into New York was originally chartered as three companies. The Providence and Plainfield Railroad, chartered in June 1846, would run from Providence to the Rhode Island/Connecticut state line. The Hartford and Providence Railroad, incorporated in May 1847, would continue west to Hartford, Connecticut, and the New York and Hartford Railroad, chartered and incorporated in May 1845, would continue to the New York and Harlem Railroad at Brewster, New York. In 1849, the two Connecticut companies merged to form the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, with a modified charter to continue past Brewster to Fishkill, New York on the Hudson River, and in 1851 the Rhode Island company was merged into it. Later that year the first section opened, from Hartford east to Willimantic. Extensions opened east to Providence in 1854 and west to Waterbury in 1855. The HP&F went bankrupt on January 1, 1858, and was run by the trustees until 1863, when it was leased by the newly formed Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad.\n\nAt the Boston end, the earliest predecessor was the Norfolk County Railroad, chartered April 24, 1847. The line from the Boston and Providence Railroad's branch at Dedham, Massachusetts southwest to Walpole opened on April 23, 1849, and an extension to the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Blackstone opened May 16. The company went bankrupt soon after. The short Medway Branch Railroad was leased in 1851, opening December 29, 1852.\n\nOn May 1, 1849 the Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad was incorporated to extend the line west from Blackstone to Southbridge. On its way to Douglas, this railroad passed through Ironstone, where there was a factory that made Kentucky Blue Jeans, and a nearby iron forge. The Midland Railroad was incorporated May 2, 1850 to build a new entrance to Boston, merging with the existing one south of Dedham. The two companies were consolidated with the Norfolk County Railroad on December 12, 1853 to form the Boston and New York Central Railroad, which had the intent of continuing southwest through Connecticut all the way to New York City. The first section of this extension was incorporated in May 1853 as the East Thompson Railroad, forming the Connecticut portion of the Southbridge and Blackstone.\n\nThe extension from Blackstone southwest to Mechanicsville, Connecticut on the Norwich and Worcester Railroad was completed in 1853. In January 1855 the new main line to Boston was opened, but was closed six months later until December 1856 because of an injunction due to the danger of the numerous grade crossings. The new line ran to a terminal at the foot of Summer Street in downtown Boston via South Boston. The full line was first operated as one on June 1, 1855, but again failed quickly. On August 6 operations were restarted on only the original Dedham-Blackstone line, operated by the Boston and Providence Railroad as a branch. On March 2, 1857 the trustees took repossession, ending the operation by the B&P. The East Thompson Railroad leased the line, reopening it again in full for about a year before another failure. At that time, all but the original Dedham-Blackstone line and Medway Branch were closed until 1867. The closed lines were sold in November 1858 to the Midland Railroad, but were not operated due to bad condition. The Midland Land Damage Company tried again in 1862, changing its name to the Southern Midland Railroad in 1863 without success.\n\nIn May 1863, the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad was chartered to take over operations of the failed lines and continue the line west to Fishkill, New York, with a car float from there to the Erie Railroad at Newburgh. It quickly leased the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad from its trustees, giving it a line from Providence west to Waterbury. In September of that year it acquired the former Boston and New York Central Railroad, but did not operate it yet; the old Norfolk County Railroad continued operations by its trustees.\n\nIn the meantime, the New York and Boston Railroad had built a line from Brookline, Massachusetts (outside Boston) southwest to Woonsocket, Rhode Island, crossing the Norfolk County Railroad in Blackstone. On January 4, 1865 the BH&E absorbed that company, making its Woonsocket Division. On December 13 of the same year, various Erie Railway men were elected to the BH&E board, placing it under partial control of the Erie.\n\nOn February 11, 1867 the BH&E leased the Norfolk County Railroad, finally reopening the full line from Mechanicsville to Boston. That same year, the branch to Southbridge (part of the original Southbridge and Blackstone charter) opened. The Norwich and Worcester Railroad was leased in 1869, finally giving it a route to Boston, using the N&W from the Providence line at Plainfield north to the old Norfolk County Railroad at Mechanicsville. In August 1872 a direct connection from Willimantic on the line to Providence northeast to Mechanicsville opened, completing the direct line to Boston. The Willimantic stop also afforded a transfer to the New London Northern Railroad for Palmer, Massachusetts and Brattleboro, Vermont to the north, and for New London to the south.\n\nBy 1869 the BH&E leased the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad, which was building a line roughly southwest-northeast in Dutchess County, New York. The BH&E planned to build west to the D&C at the future Hopewell Junction, but was not able to complete the line and lost the lease in 1870.\n\nOn September 9, 1872 the Long Island Rail Road's \"Boston Express\" began operations, using the BH&E from Norwich (at the south end of the N&W) to Boston. This was later replaced around 1891 with the \"Long Island and Eastern States Express\", using the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad from Wilson Point to the BH&E (then the NY&NE) at Hawleyville (east of Danbury).\n\nThe New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad was leased in 1873, giving a line to New Haven. Later that year, the BH&E went bankrupt and was reorganized April 17 as the New York and New England Railroad; the N&W lease was kept but the NHM&W lease was forfeited (prior to its opening August 12), becoming part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad system in 1879.\n\nNote: Various sources note the Boston Hartford & Erie as failing and falling into receivership in 1870, yet it was during the Panic of 1873 that 89 of the country's 364 railroads went bankrupt. The New York and New England Railroad Company was chartered by special act of the Massachusetts legislature on April 17, 1873. Such was the mess of the Boston Hartford & Erie's mortgages and land titles that the NY&NE did not enter into possession of any of the BH&E \"system\" until sometime in 1875. Alvin F. Harlow in \"Steelways of New England\" states that the NY&NE did not get possession of the Hartford Providence & Fishkill line until 1877.\n\nThrough its entire existence (1873–1895) the NY&NE was always bedeviled by uncertainty in its land titles. Symptomatic of this: the $20 million common stock of the NY&NE originated as the $20,000,000 principal amount of the \"Berdell Bonds\"; the chartering legislation said the NY&NE was to \"succeed to the rights of the Berdell Bondholders\". There was a 10% assessment levied on the Berdell Bondholders as part of the chartering legislation, which also appropriated the necessary monies for the state to pay its assessment on its $3 million of Berdell Bonds. For some reason $1,000 of Berdell bonds were never issued so for years the NY&NE had $19.999 million of common stock outstanding.\n\nThrough all this the receivers of the BH&E and the later management of the NY&NE continued to hold on to the BH&E's Norwich & Worcester lease which was a major part, if not the principal prop to the entire system's existence. The N&W and its related Norwich Line steamers (passenger and freight) made money, enough that the NY&NE could afford to pay 8% (reduced from 10% by negotiation ca. 1885) on the N&W's capital stock.\n\nIn 1881 the extension from Waterbury west to Hopewell Junction on the Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad opened. Along with trackage rights over the ND&C southwest to Beacon, and a short line built by the NY&NE to the Hudson River at Beacon, this completed the main lines from Boston and Providence to the Hudson River, where a train ferry took cars to the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad's Newburg Branch at Newburgh. Part of the line in New York was built along the never-used grade from the failed Putnam and Dutchess Railroad.\n\nAlso in 1881 the New York, Westchester and Putnam Railway was completed, running north and east from New York City to the NY&NE at Brewster. This company had been previously involved with the BH&E in building a through line between New York and Boston, even being called the New York and Boston Railroad at first, and with its opening such a through line was formed. For some time such a traffic arrangement was made, lasting through the NYW&P's absorption into the New York Central Railroad in 1894.\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge opened in 1888, providing a fixed crossing of the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, north of the NY&NE car float at Beacon. The Central New England and Western Railroad, which owned the bridge, chartered the Dutchess County Railroad in 1890 and completed it in 1892, providing a branch from the bridge to the NY&NE at Hopewell Junction.\n\nThere was a December 31, 1883/January 1, 1884 receivership that got referred to at the time as the \"Midnight Receivership\" which featured the NY&NE officers trying to find a federal judge to issue a receivership order before the end of the year. This receivership was over by 1886.\n\nCyrus W. Field had become a major figure behind the NY&NE by 1886 but after the state of Massachusetts refused to sell him the $3 million in stock it held (instead disposing of the shares to a rival group because of concern about Field's close association with Jay Gould) Field sold his holdings in the NY&NE. The Massachusetts sale of NY&NE stock was part of a deliberate policy on the part of Massachusetts to get out of owning railroads; the sale of the Hoosac Tunnel line to the Fitchburg in 1887 was also done under this policy, a declared policy of Massachusetts Governor Andrew.\nThe new NY&NE President in 1887 was Jabez A. Bostwick, a Standard Oil partner of John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller's brother William sat on the board of the New Haven. With Rockefeller lieutenants in both camps one wonders whether the NY&NE-NYNH&H \"rivalry\" may have been a Standard Oil \"Divide & Conquer\" policy to get low rates and other benefits out of both roads who together controlled nearly all rail business in New England south of the Boston and Albany Railroad (running through Massachusetts from Boston to Worcester, to Springfield, Pittsfield and on to Albany, New York).\n\nThe final bankruptcy of the NY&NE happened on December 27, 1893 and the company was reorganized on August 26, 1895 as the New England Railroad; Stuart Daggett in Railroad Reorganization states the 1895 NY&NE reorganization featured a hefty 20% assessment on NY&NE common. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the company for 99 years from July 1, 1898 at 3% on the preferred (normal dividend) and common stock. The New England Railroad was merged into the New Haven in 1908.\n\nMany sources state that most of the NE stock had early on been acquired by the New Haven, probably bought in 1895 when NY&NE stockholders who did not want to forfeit their shares for non-assessment dumped their shares on the market. Baker in Formation of the New England Rail Systems claims there was a mini-Northern Pacific type corner in 1894 in NY&NE common when parties \"Friendly\" to the Boston & Albany tried to buy controlling influence in the NY&NE and the New Haven had to buy a large position in NY&NE common. Both parties apparently wound up together buying more NY&NE common than actually existed; worse, the New Haven had had to pay high prices for near worthless shares.\n\nThe most well-known and prestigious train of the New York & New England Railroad was the New England Limited of 1891, a crack Boston - New York passenger train. In 1891, the Pullman Palace Car Company refitted the train with luxurious new cars decorated in white and gold, inspiring the advertising department to call it the White Train and folks along the line to call it the Ghost Train as it sped through their towns after dark. It caught the romantic imagination of New Englanders and even after it was long gone, Lucius Beebe, a Bostonian and noted railroad writer, felt compelled to memorialize it. Famed author Rudyard Kipling memorialized the train in a popular verse:\n\nMuch of the major foundation of the line of the NY & NE was the legacy of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, whose mainline ran from Providence, Rhode Island, west to Plainfield, Connecticut, to Willimantic, to Vernon, to Hartford, to Waterbury, to New Britain, to Danbury, and finally to Brewster, NY.\n\nUntil 1955 the NY, NH & H ran passenger trains from Boston to Blackstone, to Putnam, joining the above line at Willimantic and continually finally to Waterbury. This included the weekday limited stops \"Nutmeg\" train. The last remnant of service on this line was a Hartford-Waterbury segment that ended in the 1960s.\n\nAs time passed and sections were abandoned, the former NY&NE main lines became minor branches. \nIn addition to the two main lines to Boston and Providence, splitting at Willimantic, numerous branches and auxiliary lines existed.\n\nThe original Boston line ended at Dedham with a connection to the Boston and Providence Railroad. In 1883 what had become a branch to Dedham was abandoned. Prior to that, a new branch just to the east had been built in 1881, and was supplemented in 1890 by a connection to the south.\n\nThe Medway Branch Railroad from the main line at Norfolk west to Medway was incorporated in 1849 and opened in 1852, being immediately leased to the Norfolk County Railroad. It closed in 1864, two years after the New York and Boston Railroad reached Medway.\n\nThe Rhode Island and Massachusetts Railroad was chartered in 1875 and opened in 1877, connecting the main Boston line at Franklin to the Providence and Worcester Railroad at Valley Falls. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1887.\n\nThe Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened a line from Milford to Bellingham in 1868. It was leased by the Providence and Worcester Railroad until 1883.\n\nThe Hopkinton Railway was organized in 1870 and opened in 1872, running from Milford north via Hopkinton to the Boston and Worcester Railroad at Ashland. The Providence and Worcester leased it until 1885. In 1884 the Milford and Woonsocket bought the Hopkinton, and the two ran as one.\n\nThe Milford, Franklin and Providence Railroad was organized in 1868 and opened in 1883, extending the line southeast from Milford to Franklin.\n\nOn April 1, 1897 the New England Railroad leased all three companies.\n\nThe line eventually running from Brookline, Massachusetts to Harrisville, Rhode Island was originally built as a competitor to the NY&NE's Boston line. The first section opened in 1852 as part of the Charles River Railroad. It reached Woonsocket, Rhode Island in 1863, and in 1891 the Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad opened, continuing the line to the Providence and Springfield Railroad at Harrisville. In 1873 the NY&NE obtained the line to Woonsocket via a merger; on April 1, 1896 the New England Railroad leased the continuation past Woonsocket.\n\nThe Providence and Springfield Railroad was chartered in 1853 and opened in 1873 from Providence, Rhode Island northwest to Pascoag. An extension to Douglas Junction on the NY&NE main line in Massachusetts opened in 1893, and the New England Railroad leased the line on July 1, 1896.\n\nThe Southbridge Branch from East Thompson, Connecticut to Southbridge, Massachusetts was part of the original charter for the Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad, and opened in 1867, after it had been consolidated.\n\nThe Pawtuxet Valley Railroad was organized in 1872 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1874, running from the main line at River Point to Hope. The New York, Providence and Boston Railroad leased it in 1884 as a continuation of their Pontiac Branch Railroad.\n\nThe Norwich and Worcester Railroad was an 1837 consolidation of the Boston, Norwich and New London Railroad Company of Connecticut and the Worcester and Norwich Railroad Company of Massachusetts when both state legislatures passed acts allowing the merger. Neither of these companies had built any railroad but the new one proceeded to build one from Norwich, Connecticut (later New London) north to Worcester, Massachusetts, including the Taft Tunnel at Lisbon, CT. The Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad leased it in 1869, and the lease continued through the reorganizations. Connections were provided with the Providence line at Plainfield and the Boston line between Putnam and Mechanicsville. In 1886 the New England Railroad company renewed the lease. that it acquired from the Boston, Hartford, and Erie.\n\nUntil 1955 the line served as the basis for Boston-bypassing run-through train, the \"East Wind\" from New York to Bangor, Maine, via the Norwich and Worcester line.\n\nThe New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad opened and was leased to the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad in 1873. The BH&E went bankrupt later that year, as did the NHM&W in 1875. The NHM&W became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1879.\n\nThe Rockville Railroad was incorporated in 1857 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1863. It was a short branch from the main line at Vernon north and east to Rockville.\n\nThe South Manchester Railroad was chartered in 1866 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1869. It was a short branch from the main line at Manchester south to South Manchester.\n\nThe Connecticut Central Railroad was chartered in 1871, and its continuation in Massachusetts, the Springfield and New London Railroad, in 1874, to build a line from East Hartford to Springfield, with a branch to the Rockville Railroad at Westway. It opened in 1876 and was immediately leased by the Connecticut Valley Railroad, which gave up the lease to the New York and New England Railroad in 1880.\n\nThe Meriden, Waterbury and Connecticut River Railroad was formed in 1888 as a consolidation of two smaller companies, opening in 1885 and 1888. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1892, as a branch from the main line in Waterbury east to Cromwell on the Connecticut River. The company went bankrupt and was reorganized in 1898 as the Middletown, Meriden and Waterbury Railroad, and was immediately leased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.\n\nFor the line from Boston to Readville, see Fairmount Line. For the line from Readville to Franklin, see Franklin Line.\nWithin the last 10 years, funds have been set aside for a rails to trails conversion. As January 2014, the easternmost segments spanning from Garfield Avenue/Cranston Street (near Amtrak's Northeast Corridor), West Warwick (former Riverpoint/Hope Railway spur point) and Coventry have continuous pavement totaling to approximately 14.2 miles\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900863", "title": "2005 Ethiopian general election", "text": "2005 Ethiopian general election\n\nEthiopia held general elections on May 15, 2005, for seats in both its national House of Peoples' Representatives and in four regional government councils. Under pressure from the international community, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi promised that this election would be proof that more democracy would come in this multi-ethnic nation; international elections observers from the European Union (EU) and the U.S.-based Carter Center were present to observe the results. This election succeeded in attracting about 90% of the registered voters to the polls. A government ban on protests was imposed throughout the election period.\n\nEU observers remarked on the \"significantly enlarged freedoms for political campaigning in comparison to previous elections\". Political parties campaigned actively, and opposition parties appeared to be increasingly active in the rural areas. The observer mission described the atmosphere \"during the campaign was calm, culminating in two massive, peaceful rallies in Addis Ababa, one by the EPRDF and one by the opposition.\"\n\nDespite this, opposition parties alleged numerous cases of intimidation, and arrests of its supporters. While the EU observers could not investigate all of the alleged cases, it did confirm those it investigated. International human rights groups likewise cataloged a number of cases of human rights violations. However, the EU observers wrote in their final report, they \"recorded no arrests of EPRDF supporters for campaign offences.\"\n\nTowards the close of the campaigning, the language became more vicious, with each side accusing the other of numerous violations of the campaigning rules. \"Campaign rhetoric became insulting,\" the EU observer's report noted, then continued:\nThe most extreme example of this came from the Deputy Prime Minister, Addisu Legesse, who, in a public debate on 15 April, compared the opposition parties with the \"Interhamwe\" militia, which perpetrated the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The Prime Minister made the same comparison on 5 May in relation to the CUD. The EPRDF made the same associations during its free slots on radio and TV. The opposition coalition UEDF then used the comparison against the government in a TV spot showing footage of the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\". Such rhetoric is unacceptable in a democratic election.\n\nEarly results showed the opposition with a big lead, sweeping all of the contested seats in the capital Addis both in the race for parliamentary as well as local government. By the afternoon of 16 May, the opposition claimed it was halfway towards winning a majority in the national parliament with only about a third of the constituencies reporting complete results. Later that day, trailing badly in the preliminary report covering just under 200 seats released by the National Election Board, the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) announced that it had won more than 317 seats out of 547, while conceding that opposition parties won all 23 seats in the capital city Addis Ababa. The two major opposition parties, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) and the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces (UEDF) claimed on that same day that they had won 185 of the approximately 200 seats for which the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) had released preliminary results. That was a significant improvement over the 12 seats the opposition had in the previous parliament.\n\nBy law, the NEBE was required to announce the official results on 8 June. However, the vote tallying process was jeopardized when the opposition claimed that the Addis Ababa vote was rigged and during the evening of 16 May, the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency, outlawed any public gathering, assumed direct command of the security forces, and replaced the capital city police with federal police and special forces drawn from elite army units. The NEBE, simultaneously, ordered the vote tallying process to stop, an order which was not rescinded for nearly a week, yet another action against which the opposition and the independent election monitors strongly objected.\n\nThe next official report from the NEBE, released on 27 May, showed that the EPRDF had won 209 seats, and affiliated parties 12 more. The report indicated the opposition parties had won 142 seats. \"These results are provisional, and these results could change because we are looking into complaints by some of the parties,\" said NEBE spokesman Getahun Amogne.\n\nObservers from the European Union afterwards \"assessed the closing and counting processes negatively in almost half of urban polling stations observed, a very high figure for international observers to record, and even worse in rural polling stations observed.\" Counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, and there was a lack of transparency in the results. \"Result sheets were only displayed at 29 per cent of rural polling stations observed and 36 per cent of urban polling stations observed at the completion of counting. In 25 per cent of polling stations observed, political party representatives were not provided with a copy of the results.\"\n\nThe situation only deteriorated with the following day, according to the observers, \nstarting with a blanket ban, issued immediately after the end of voting, on freedom of assembly in the capital. Media coverage also worsened. State media published statements by government/EPRDF personnel claiming victory in the elections, despite the fact that counting was still underway, but refused to publish opposition statements. Incidents involving students started on the night of 5 June and extended on 6 and 7 June with hundreds being arrested. During a demonstration in Addis Ababa on 8 June, security forces killed at least 36 citizens and in the aftermath arrested thousands of persons, mostly linked to the opposition, who were accused of spreading \"political unrest\".\n\nThe CUD lodged complaints in 139 constituencies, the UEDF lodged 89 complaints, while the EPRDF has raised concerns over irregularities in more than 50 seats. Including the complaints lodged by small parties, complaints concerning the results in 299 parliamentary seats were lodged. According to an official of the NEBE, political parties had until June 3 to provide evidence of fraud, or their complaints would be dismissed. However investigations led to elections being re-run at a minimum of 16 voting stations, and affecting elections for at least six seats. Writing in November of that year, scholar Christopher Clapham noted that \"the official results of the elections are both complex in themselves, and deeply affected by fraud\". On one hand, he pointed out that the EPRDF lost heavily in those cities of Ethiopia which were bellwethers of public opinion; on the other, \n\nProvisional results were scheduled to be released on May 23, but the need to investigate claims of voting irregularities and disruptions in two southern regions — Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region and Oromia — delayed the release of these results until June 8, the date originally scheduled for releasing the official results. When the ruling party was unofficially reported the winner of the election, demonstrations protesting alleged election fraud broke out, and continued into June. Hundreds of students were arrested in at least nine cities, including Gondar, Bure, Bahir Dar, Debre Marqos, Dessie and Awassa for demonstrating despite a month-old ban on protests imposed on the government. At the same time, security forces arrested dozens of locally prominent CUD members in Gondar, Dessie, Wondo Genet, Kombolcha and Jinka; unconfirmed reports of arrests following a similar pattern came from several other towns. On June 8, police shot 42 people gathering at the Piazza and Merkato markets of Addis Ababa. The government afterwards stated that an appropriate level of force was used and accused the CUD of fomenting dissent; the CUD denied these accusations, and claimed that the government was attempting to distract attention from election fraud. This led to the leaders of the CUD, including head Hailu Shawul, being put under house arrest while hundreds of security forces patrolled the streets of the capital.\n\nOn July 8, the NEBE released the first official results for 307 of the 547 national parliamentary seats. Of the 307 seats, the EPRDF had won 139, while CUD and UEDF won 93 and 42, respectively. Smaller parties and independent candidates won the remaining 33 seats. However, Berhanu Nega, vice-chairman of the CUD, had criticized the process on July 20, claiming that \"The investigation process was a complete failure. Our representatives and witnesses have been harassed, threatened, barred and killed upon their return from the hearings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the NEBE investigated voting fraud and other irregularities, while also arranging new polls to resolve some disputes. On August 9, official results were released, acknowledging that the ruling EPRDF had won 296 of the total 524 seats — about 56% — enabling it to form a government, while its allied parties won 22 seats. The UEDF won 52 seats. Berhanu said his party, which had officially won 109 seats, was debating whether they would challenge the results in court. Repeat elections were scheduled for August 21 in 31 areas where either irregularities were reported or results were challenged.\n\nOpposition parties had decided to boycott the related August 21 elections in the Somali Region. The CUD withdrew 10 of the 17 candidates it was fielding in Somali region, while the Western Somali Democratic Party, the Somali Democratic Alliance Forces and Del Wabe People's Democratic Movement who had planned to field 43 candidates for the Federal Parliamentary Assembly and 273 candidates for the regional parliament in the regional capital of Jijiga, also announced that they would boycott this election.\n\nOn September 5, the NEBE released its final results, in which the EPRDF retained its control of the government with 327 seats; within the EPRDF, the Oromo People's Democratic Organization won 110 seats, the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement 92 seats, the Amhara National Democratic Movement 87 seats and the Tigray People's Liberation Front 38 seats. Opposition parties won 174 seats.\n\nProtests of the results, led by Coalition for Democracy and Unity, began on November 1, 2005, and have prompted more than 60,000 arrests. Live gunfire from government forces has been directed at protesters and bystanders, killing at least 42. A number of policemen were also killed suggesting that violence was not all on the side of the state.\n\nOn October 18, 2006, the draft report of a 10-member public inquiry into election-related unrests was released to Associated Press (AP). It concludes that a total of 199 people (193 civilians and six policemen) were killed and 763 were injured, a significantly higher figure than the Ethiopian government's claim that 61 civilians and seven policemen were killed. The vice chairman of the inquiry, judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, who fled Ethiopia a month prior after he had received anonymous death threats, told AP that \"this was a massacre ... these demonstrators were unarmed yet the majority died from shots to the head.\" He added that the government attempted to pressure and intimidate members of the inquiry after learning about its controversial finding. The Ethiopian government did not immediately comment on the leaked report, but the next day, it told BBC that its contents were \"hearsay.\" The European Union's chief observer during the elections, Ana Maria Gomes, stated that the draft report \"only confirms what we have said in our report on the elections,\" and \"that indeed there were massive human rights violations.\" \n\n\n\n"}

The school building is located on Highway 285 in Park County.\n\nPlatte Canyon School originally housed all grades, K through 12, in a one-story, long building. Grade school students were in one half of the building, while junior high and high school students were in the other half. Entry was in the middle with school offices located inside the front door, and the original gym located straight back.\n\nDuring 1965 and 1966, a small new two-story building was constructed. Some of the new classes offered included Home Economics and Shop. The kitchen and lunchroom were also located in the new building.\n\nRemodeling and construction took place several years ago. This construction led to the annexation of the middle and high schools into a larger building commonly known as the West Building. The former high school became the East Building, now functioning primarily as the district office. The East Building also contains two high school gyms, the auditorium, the swimming pool and the old track field.\n\nA newer track and football field were created with the new school. This field is actually on the opposite side of Highway 285. Access to the field is gained by way of an old railroad bridge spanning the highway. A new baseball field was also planned, but lack of funds and a decreasing enrollment rate had placed those plans on hold. As of late 2010 a softball field had been completed, but not the baseball field.\n\nStudent population per grade climbed to a peak of about 90 students per class before beginning an eventual decline during the construction of the new school building.\n\nDue to a lack of sufficient funds, the school has recently begun a search to find new sources of money. For instance, student parking was free to all in 2001, but in the 2004 school year, a fee of $50 per year was implemented. To participate in an after-school activity in 2001, a student was expected to pay $85, whereas the same activities were $35 in 2003.\n\nAlthough the school is public, students wishing to enroll at Platte Canyon High can purchase an \"Activities Card\" for $35. A new card must be purchased at the beginning of each school year. The card grants the student free or discounted access to dances, sporting events, and performances at the school. The funds from card fees are used to support such student activities.\n\nEven the modest pricing of school lunch has climbed in the last few years. The cost of a pint of milk jumped from twenty-five cents to thirty-five cents within a short time span, while the overall cost of an average lunch was $2 and rising as of 2004.\n\nOver time, the school's lack of funds has meant the closure of several classes and clubs, including home economics, wood shop, German, drafting and boys' swimming. \n\nThe Marge E. Hudak Pool, located in the school's East Building, had been another part of the school in constant jeopardy. However, in 2005 a referendum was approved by the residents of the school district to provide the pool with an annual budget sufficient to maintain its programs. The Friends of the Pool Inc, a 501(c)3 tax exempt corporation, was formed to raise funds in support of the pool.\n\nPlatte Canyon High School is a member of the Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) and the Frontier League. The Platte Canyon Huskies participate in 2A football (Colorado Conference) and 3A Frontier League basketball, baseball, cheer, cross country, speech and debate, softball, track & field, volleyball, wrestling, along with 4A Inter-League girls' swimming and 5A State League alpine skiing.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, a \"hostage situation\" was reported at 11:40 a.m. local time (1740 UTC) at the high school. Duane R. Morrison, 53, of Denver, reportedly said that he had a bomb. He had taken six students as hostages in a second-floor room and released four of them while keeping the other two; each of the six hostages was female.\nOnce SWAT members approached, one of the female hostages, identified as 16-year-old Emily Keyes, was shot and critically wounded. She was taken away by a helicopter, and was later declared dead from her injuries. The hostage-taker then shot and killed himself. The other female was not wounded.\n\n"}

In Buddhism, \"mind\" denotes an internal sense organ which interacts with sense objects that include sense impressions, feelings, perceptions and volition.\n\nIn the Four Noble Truths, the Buddha identifies that the origin of suffering (Pali, Skt.: \"dukkha\") is craving (Pali: \"\"; Skt.: \"). In the chain of Dependent Origination, the Buddha identifies that craving arises from sensations that result from contact at the six sense bases. (See Figure 2 below.) Therefore, to overcome craving and its resultant suffering, one should develop restraint of and insight into the sense bases.\n\nThroughout the Pali Canon, the sense bases are referenced in hundreds of discourses. In these diverse discourses, the sense bases are contextualized in different ways including:\n\n\nIn \"The Vipers\" discourse (\"Asivisa Sutta\", SN 35.197), the Buddha likens the internal sense bases to an \"empty village\" and the external sense bases to \"village-plundering bandits.\" Using this metaphor, the Buddha characterizes the \"empty\" sense organs as being \"attacked by agreeable & disagreeable\" sense objects.\n\nElsewhere in the same collection of discourses (SN 35.191), the Buddha's Great Disciple Sariputta clarifies that the actual suffering associated with sense organs and sense objects is not \"inherent\" to these sense bases but is due to the \"fetters\" (here identified as \"desire and lust\") that arise when there is contact between a sense organ and sense object.\n\nIn the \"Fire Sermon\" (\"Adittapariyaya Sutta\", SN 35.28), delivered several months after the Buddha's awakening, the Buddha describes all sense bases and related mental processes in the following manner:\n\nThe Buddha taught that, in order to escape the dangers of the sense bases, one must be able to apprehend the sense bases without defilement. In \"Abandoning the Fetters\" (SN 35.54), the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as impermanent\" (Pali: \"anicca\") the six sense organs, objects, sense-consciousness, contact and sensations. Similarly, in \"Uprooting the Fetters\" (SN 35.55), the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as nonself\" (\"anatta\") the aforementioned five sextets.\n\nTo foster this type of penetrative knowing and seeing and the resultant release from suffering, in the Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10) the Buddha instructs monks to meditate on the sense bases and the dependently arising fetters as follows:\n\nThe \"Vimuttimagga\", the \"Visuddhimagga\", and associated Pali commentaries and subcommentaries all contribute to traditional knowledge about the sense bases.\n\nWhen the Buddha speaks of \"understanding\" the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, what is meant?\n\nAccording to the first-century CE Sinhalese meditation manual, \"Vimuttimagga\", the sense organs can be understood in terms of the object sensed, the consciousness aroused, the underlying \"sensory matter,\" and an associated primary or derived element that is present \"in excess.\" These characteristics are summarized in the table below.\nThe compendious fifth-century CE \"Visuddhimagga\" provides similar descriptors, such as \"the size of a mere louse's head\" for the location of the eye's \"sensitivity\" (Pali: \"pasāda\"; also known as, \"sentient organ, sense agency, sensitive surface\"), and \"in the place shaped like a goat's hoof\" regarding the nose sensitivity (Vsm. XIV, 47–52). In addition, the Visuddhimagga describes the sense organs in terms of the following four factors:\nThus, for instance, it describes the eye as follows:\n\nIn regards to the sixth internal sense base of mind (\"mano\"), Pali subcommentaries (attributed to Dhammapāla Thera) distinguish between consciousness arising from the five physical sense bases and that arising from the primarily post-canonical notion of a \"life-continuum\" or \"unconscious mind\" (\"bhavaga-mana\"):\n\nIn the fifth-century CE exegetical \"Visuddhimagga\", Buddhaghosa identifies knowing about the sense bases as part of the \"soil\" of liberating wisdom. Other components of this \"soil\" include the aggregates, the faculties, the Four Noble Truths and Dependent Origination.\n\n\n\n<div col||20em|small=yes>\n<div col end>\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900879", "title": "Total factor productivity", "text": "Total factor productivity\n\nIn economics, total-factor productivity (TFP), also called \"multi-factor productivity\", is usually measured as the ratio of aggregate output (e.g., GDP) to aggregate inputs. Under some simplifications about the production technology, growth in TFP becomes the portion of growth in output not explained by growth in traditionally measured inputs of labour and capital used in production. TFP is calculated by dividing output by the weighted average of labour and capital input, with the standard weighting of 0.7 for labour and 0.3 for capital. Total factor productivity is a measure of economic efficiency and accounts for part of the differences in cross-country per-capita income. The rate of \"TFP\" growth is calculated by subtracting growth rates of labor and capital inputs from the growth rate of output.\n\nTechnology growth and efficiency are regarded as two of the biggest sub-sections of Total Factor Productivity, the former possessing \"special\" inherent features such as positive externalities and non-rivals which enhance its position as a driver of economic growth.\n\nTotal Factor Productivity (TFP) is often considered the primary contributor to GDP Growth Rate. While other contributing factors include labor inputs, human capital, and physical capital. Total factor productivity measures residual growth in total output of a firm, industry or national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of traditional inputs such as labor and capital. Since this cannot be measured directly the process of calculating derives TFP as the residual which accounts for effects on total output not caused by inputs. \n\nIt has been shown that there is a historical correlation between TFP and energy conversion efficiency. Also, it has been found that integration (among firms for example) has a causal positive impact on total factor productivity.\n\nThe equation below (in Cobb–Douglas form) is often used to represent total output (Y) as a function of total-factor productivity (A), capital input (K), labour input (L), and the two inputs' respective shares of output (α and β are the share of contribution for K and L respectively). As usual for equations of this form, an increase in either A, K or L will lead to an increase in output.\n\nAs a residual, TFP is also dependent on estimates of the other components.\n\nIn 2001, William Easterly and Ross Levine estimated that for an average country the TFP accounts for 60 percent of growth of output per worker.\n\nA 2005 study on human capital attempted to correct for weaknesses in estimations of the labour component of the equation, by refining estimates of the quality of labour. Specifically, years of schooling is often taken as a proxy for the quality of labour (and stock of human capital), which does not account for differences in schooling between countries. Using these re-estimations, the contribution of TFP was substantially lower.\n\nRobert Ayres and Benjamin Warr have found that the model can be improved by using the efficiency of energy conversion, which roughly tracks \"technological progress\".\n\nThe word \"total\" suggests all inputs have been measured. Official statisticians tend to use the term \"multifactor productivity\" (MFP) instead of TFP because some inputs such as energy are usually not included, attributes of the workforce are rarely included, and public infrastructure such as highways is almost never included.\n\nGrowth accounting exercises and Total Factor Productivity are open to the Cambridge Critique. Therefore, some economists believe that the method and its results are invalid or need to be carefully interpreted and used along with other alternative approaches.\n\nOn the basis of dimensional analysis, TFP has been criticized as lacking meaningful units of measurement. The units of the quantities in the Cobb–Douglas equation are:\nIn this construction the units of \"A\" would not have a simple economic interpretation, and the concept of TFP appear to be a modeling artifact. Official statistics avoid measuring levels, instead constructing unitless growth rates of output and inputs and thus also for the residual.\n\n\n"}

Located in the South Pacific Ocean, the heavily-camouflaged island serves as the secret base of the International Rescue organisation.\n\nThe island has had several releases as a children's toy, most notably in the early 1990s, 2000 and 2015. The first two models were commercially very successful, causing retailers to run out of stock. It was the 1993 British Association of Toy Retailers' \"Toy of the Year\".\n\n\"Thunderbird 1\" is launched from a hangar underneath the island's retractable swimming pool, at the foot of the main Tracy Villa. The entrance to the \"Thunderbird 2\" hangar is concealed by a false rock-face and leads onto the island's runway. On exiting the hangar, the palm trees lining the runway swing outwards to accommodate the wingspan of \"Thunderbird 2\". After taxiing along the runway, \"Thunderbird 2\" takes off from a hydraulic launch platform. \"Thunderbird 3\" is launched from underneath the Round House. Features such as the outside staircase descending to water, the large windows, and the prominent stone chimney, suggest that the design was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater House. In the 2004 live-action film, a projection of the flightpath from Tracy Island to London clearly shows the former as being located in the Atlantic Ocean, whereas in the original TV series the island was located in the Pacific.\n\nAlthough the security of the island is stated to be assured by jamming equipment, it proves to be somewhat vulnerable in the comic strips of \"TV Century 21\" due to the machinations of The Hood. Learning everything about the island by brainwashing the technically minded Brains and extracting all of his knowledge concerning the island, the Hood launches his strongest attack yet on IR, destroying several \"Thunderbird\" craft and many of their hangars, with the exception of \"Thunderbirds 1\" and \"4\". (The canonicity of the \"Thunderbirds\" comics adventures is open to interpretation.)\n\nDerek Meddings, special effects supervisor on the puppet series, described his excitement at designing Tracy Island as \"one of those feelings you get when you're a kid, imagining that you're Robinson Crusoe living on a lovely island.\"\n\nFor the 2004 live-action film, the main shooting location for the island exteriors was North Island in the Seychelles. Co-producer Mark Huffam described Tracy Island as \"the most idyllic [...] imaginable, with crystal-clear waters, tropical jungle and mountainous peaks\", adding that it was \"fantastic\" that North Island provided \"all these essential elements\". Various locations on Praslin, including Anse Lazio beach and Vallée de Mai nature preserve, were also used.\n\nThe buildings on the re-imagined island were deliberately given a \"retro-futuristic\" appearance, described by production designer John Beard as \"based in the '60s and '70s, which is similar to what we were doing for \"Brazil\".\" Further inspiration was drawn from the work of Oscar Niemeyer and others. The interiors set at Pinewood Studios was built in what Beard described as a \"kind of double-'S' shape\". He added that \"because we're not building the top, it means we can hang the building from the top ceiling in the studio, which we couldn't have done outside.\"\n\nIn the UK, repeats of \"Thunderbirds\" on BBC2 in the early 1990s led to renewed public interest in the series and a fresh wave of tie-in toys. In the run-up to Christmas 1992, demand for Tracy Island playsets increased considerably and retailers ran out of stock, leading to overnight queues outside stores. The story was reported in the national news and has since been cited as the archetypal mistake to be avoided by the toy industry during the Christmas shopping season; according to the BBC, the toy \"caused hysteria in shops across the UK.\" The playset was a contender for the British Association of Toy Retailers' (BATR) 1992 Toy of the Year Award, but due to the stock shortages lost to WWF Hasbro action figures. It subsequently won the 1993 award.\n\nIn January 1993, the BBC children's TV programme \"Blue Peter\" responded to the stock shortage by showing viewers how to build a home-made version out of household waste. The BBC was then, in turn, overwhelmed by requests for copies of an instruction sheet for making the model. Eventually the broadcaster stopped sending out the sheets and released a recording of presenter Anthea Turner's demonstration, titled \"Blue Peter Makes a \"Thunderbirds\" Tracy Island\", on VHS. In 2015, \"Radio Times\" described \"Blue Peter\"s island-building demonstration as \"one of the most iconic moments\" in the programme's history.\n\nThe BBC's re-launch of \"Thunderbirds\" in 2000 prompted a resurgence in the toy's popularity and a second \"Blue Peter\" demonstration. The new Tracy Island playset by Vivid Imaginations was released to a positive critical response and was listed as one of the top ten children's toys by the BATR. As before, supply of the toy did not keep up with demand. In December, the BBC reported that that only 60,000 copies of the Chinese-made product would be shipped to the UK before Christmas, despite demand being estimated at half a million. Vivid attributed the stock shortage to a lack of microchips caused by high demand from the mobile phone industry. The playset ultimately became one of the best-selling toys of 2000, with demand estimated to be up to ten times greater than supply.\n\nIn 2015, to coincide with the debut of the remake series \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", Vivid released a new Tracy Island toy incorporating smart technology.\n\nTim Bevan, producer of the live-action film, called Tracy Island \"one of the main characters of the original \"Thunderbirds\" series\". Rob McLaughlin of the entertainment website Den of Geek named it the seventh-best secret base in film and TV but challenged one particular design aspect: \"There's the small matter of the ever-present risk of a great big rocket ship appearing out the bottom of [the swimming pool] and squashing you.\"\n\nJon Abbott of \"TV Zone\" magazine criticised the base's layout, questioning why the control centre is located in the lounge when a hidden control room would eliminate the need for \"Operation Cover-Up\" – the procedure used to rid the lounge of all trace of International Rescue's presence whenever the island receives visitors from the outside world. As part of this operation, wall portraits of the Tracy brothers in their International Rescue uniforms are replaced with alternatives showing them in casual attire. Abbott asks why Jeff Tracy would even need uniformed photographs of his sons, regarding this as one of several aspects that make the Tracy Island lounge a \"delightful deranged indulgence\". However, he concedes that for child viewers, the existence of these features made \"Thunderbirds\" \"much more fun to watch than \"Z-Cars\" or \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook\"\".\n\nAs a publicity exercise, Ford Motor Company, which built the re-imagined FAB 1 for the live-action film, commissioned a \"Thunderbirds\"-themed live event and interactive experience for the 2004 British International Motor Show. The stand was designed as a replica of Tracy Island, complete with a beach, a lake, an aircraft hangar and an overhead model of \"Thunderbird 2\". Titled \"\"Thunderbirds\" Powered By Ford\", it was one of the largest exhibits ever built by construction company Imagination and proved to be a success, receiving 250-300,000 visitors and a certificate of \"High Commendation\" at the 2004 Marketing Brand Design Awards.\n\n\n"}

The film starred Chang Son Hui and Pak Sung Ho and featured special effects by Duk Ho Kim, supervised by Teruyoshi Nakano. The film was loosely based on the legend of the Bulgasari.\n\nDirector Shin had been kidnapped in 1978 by North Korean intelligence on the orders of Kim Jong-il, son of the then-ruling Kim Il-sung, and was coerced into making several films as a director, with \"Pulgasari\" being his final before he and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, escaped to the United States.\n\nIn feudal Korea, during the Goryeo Dynasty, a king controls the land with an iron fist, subjecting the peasantry to misery and starvation. An old blacksmith who was sent to prison for defending his people creates a tiny figurine of a monster by making a doll of rice, and before dying asks the gods of earth and sky to make his creation a living creature that protects the rebels and the oppressed. When the figurine comes into contact with the blood of the blacksmith's daughter, the creature springs to life, becoming a giant metal-eating monster whom the blacksmith's daughter names Pulgasari, which is the name of the mythical monster her father used to mention as an eater of iron and steel. Pulgasari now shares a special bond with the blacksmith's daughter, and after he starts eating some of the farmer's tools, becomes a giant and powerful figure.\n\nAfter much suffering, the peasants form an army, storm the palace of the region's Governor and kill him. Soon after the evil King becomes aware that there is a rebellion being planned in the country, and he intends to crush it, but he runs into Pulgasari, who fights with the peasant army to overthrow the corrupt monarchy. Pulgasari wins many battles because of his unending hunger for all kind of metal, readily provided by its enemies. Nevertheless, after capturing and executing the leader of the rebellion (who was also the future husband of the blacksmith's daughter), the King's army threatens to kill the blacksmith's daughter if Pulgasari does not surrender. Pulgasari lets itself be trapped to save the woman, and the royal army apparently kill the creature by burying it under the ground. After escaping, the blacksmith's daughter revives Pulgasari by again pouring some of her blood on the burial site. Pulgasari grows strong once more and attacks the King's palace, destroying it and simultaneously killing the King.\n\nAfter the defeat of the King, Pulgasari becomes a new problem, since he starts eating the rebel's weapons and farmer's tools, which are given to the creature without objection, since the peasants still believe Pulgasari is a benign saviour. The blacksmith's daughter realizes that Pulgasari's hunger will never stop, and that he is inadvertently oppressing the people he fought for. She decides to sacrifice herself by hiding inside a big bell that Pulgasari finds and quickly eats. Pulgasari yells in anguish as the blacksmith's daughter presence in its system causes its stomach to explode, tragically killing both of them, but saving the people once and for all.\n\n\nThe film is based around a legendary creature called the \"Pulgasari\" (or \"Bulgasari\"). The original story was set in the city of Songdo (now Kaesong, North Korea).\n\nKim was a lifelong admirer of the director, as well as \"Godzilla\" and other kaiju films. He kidnapped the former director and his wife, famous actress Choi Eun-hee, with the specific purpose of making fantasy/propaganda films for the North Korean government. Kim Jong-il also produced \"Pulgasari\" (through Korean Film Studio) and all the films that Sang-ok made before he and Choi managed to escape from their minders while on a festival tour in Austria. Specifically, the film was inspired by \"The Return of Godzilla\". The staff from Japan's Toho Studios, the creators of \"Godzilla\", participated in creating the film's special effects. They were tricked into coming as they thought they were filming in China.\n\nJonathan Ross stated that the film was intended by the North Korean government to be a propaganda metaphor for the effects of unchecked capitalism and the power of the collective.\n\nKenpachiro Satsuma was quoted as saying he preferred \"Pulgasari\" to TriStar's \"Godzilla\". There has been some speculation that the director Shin Sang-ok included a hidden message of his own in the film; the monster of the movie was to be interpreted as a metaphor for Kim Il-sung betraying a people's revolution for his own purposes.\n\nAfter finding out that his credit was removed from the movie, Shin Sang-ok also wrote a remake called \"The Adventures of Galgameth\". In 2006, \"Pulgasari\" made its New York debut at the end of Columbia University Japanese culture center's yearlong “Godzilla” festival.\n\n\"Pulgasari\" has gained some popularity over the years because of the shocking story of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee's kidnapping at the hands of North Korea's government. During their strange captivity in the country Shin and Choi were, respectively, director and leading actress in a number of North Korean films produced by Kim Jong-il. The director and leading actress made together a total of seven films, for which the couple – who were separated before their kidnapping – was simultaneously commissioned and forced to do by North Korea's government. However, \"Pulgasari\" does not feature Choi. \"Pulgasari\" was made in 1985, the same year that Shin's North Korean films \"Salt\" and \"The Tale of Shim Chong\" were released. It was the last film directed by Shin before he and Choi escaped to the United States.\n\n\n"}

He primarily worked for various National Wrestling Alliance member territories, including Florida Championship Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions. He is also known as Yoshi Kwan, initially from World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\nAshford-Smith started wrestling in 1984 using the ring name Dennis Smith.\n\nIn 1986, he began working for Florida Championship Wrestling and changed his ring name to \"Chris Champion\", the name he would be most known under. Champion teamed up with Sean Royal to form a tag team called The New Breed. The \"gimmick\" of the New Breed was that they claimed to be sent back from the year 2002 to 1986 to compete. As part of their gimmick they claimed that Dusty Rhodes would be elected President of the United States in the 2000 election, and addressed him as \"Mr. President\". They also referred to having robots and sported very unusual haircuts and bright \"futuristic\" ring gear in neon colors. Their entrance music was the Beastie Boys' song \"Fight For Your Right to Party\".\n\nOn August 3, 1986, Champion defeated Tyree Pride to win the NWA Florida Bahamian Championship from him, a title he would hold until September 28, 1986 where he lost it to The Falcon. The New Breed won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship when they defeated Kendall Windham and Vic Steamboat in the finals of a tournament for the vacant titles.

The car crash and return turned the New Breed face (\"good guys\") and they began a feud with The Midnight Express (Stan Lane and Bobby Eaton). The feud did not last long as Sean Royal retired a short time later, ending the New Breed team. After the New Breed broke up, Champion participated in the 1988 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament, teaming with his brother Mark Starr. The team defeated the Twin Devils in the opening round, but were defeated by the Powers of Pain in the second round. Following the Crockett Cup Champion briefly competed in the NWA as \"The Karate Kid\", but Ric Flair, Barry Windham and others complained of Champion's stiff kicks and he was soon pushed out of the Crockett territory.\n\nFollowing his departure from JCP Champion showed up in Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) teaming with his brother, Mark Starr to form a team called \"Wild Side\", a team that feuded with the Rock 'N Roll Express, just as the New Breed had done years before. On July 3, 1989, Wild Side faced then CWA Tag Team Champions Action Jackson and Billy Travis for the titles, in a match that became so out of control that it ended in a \"no contest\" and the titles being vacated. The following week Wild Side defeated Jackson and Travis in the rematch and won the CWA Tag Team Championship. Their title reign lasted until the Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated them for the belts on September 11, 1989. In late 1989 CWA became United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with the new name came a new attitude from Chris Champion, who broke up Wild Side and began working as a face. Champion worked feuds with USWA's top talent such as Jerry Lawler and The Dirty White Boy. For a while Champion worked as \"Kowabunga\", dressed in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bodysuit and mask. Champion left the USWA in 1991.\n\nChampion, using the Kowabunga gimmick, but using the name \"Turtle Kamen,\" wrestled a tour of Japan for Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling in August 1991. While in FMW, he teamed up with the likes of his brother Mark Starr, Jimmy Backlund, Ricky Fuji, and Amigo Ultra and battled the likes of Eiji Ezaki, Masashi Honda, and kickboxer Katsuji Ueda. After FMW, Champion returned to the States to compete in the independent circuit, namely the International Championship Wrestling Alliance in Florida and the Mountain Wrestling Association in Kentucky. He would briefly appear in Smoky Mountain Wrestling.\n\nIn June 1993, Champion returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he was given the ring persona \"Yoshi Kwan\", and was managed by Harley Race. Originally, the name was supposed to be \"Yo Chi Kwan\"- a Chinese name, but announcer Tony Schiavone announced the first name as \"Yoshi\" (which is Japanese), and it stuck. The Yoshi Kwan character was billed as being from Asia (either Hunan or Hong Kong) and wore makeup to make him appear to be Asian. Kwan scored victories over Brad Armstrong, Marcus Alexander Bagwell, 2 Cold Scorpio and others while managed by Race. Kwan feuded with Cactus Jack, with the two facing off in a singles match at WCW's 1993 Fall Brawl which Cactus Jack won. Kwan was set to face Ricky Steamboat at Halloween Havoc, but a knee injury prevented him from wrestling and he was soon out of WCW.\n\nChampion worked as \"Yoshi Kwan\" on the American independent circuit, as well as returning to FMW for a tour in March 1996. He would also return to the USWA in April 1996, but would leave the company three months later. He would resurrect the Turtle Kamen character for BattlARTS in 1999.\n\nChampion later adopted a character called \"Sinn\" that he used both in the United States and, later, in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1998, Champion worked with Chris Alexander against Frost and Mindbender for the New Age Wrestling Alliance Tag Team Championship. The title was held up due to a double countout.\n\nIn July 2002, Champion had a major stroke and was in the critical care unit for a while after that. He was able to make a full recovery from the stroke and returned to wrestling. In 2006, he teamed with Blackie West in the Southern Wrestling Federation, as \"The SS\". They won the SWF Tag Team Championship from \"Team Freedom\" (JP Jones and Max Carnage) in 2006. He also worked as a booker there.\n\nChampion died on August 22, 2018, at the age of 57. According to Ringsidenews.com, it is rumored that Champion's death was caused by another stroke. A YouTube user claiming to be Champion's daughter verified this, saying he suffered multiple strokes during his final days. She further adds Champion was on life support for 3 or 4 days before dying.\n\n"}

He was introduced to her by Dean Marley and was described as speaking with a harsh Scots voice, was dour, ungainly, often rude and frequently unshaven. Eccentric in his age this shy, reserved, rather grubby man believed that children were sensible immature people and had an excellent rapport with them.\n\nHe had a particular fondness for Lord Edward FitzGerald, preparing him for his military career.

Originally known as O. L. Kipp State Park, it was renamed in the late 1990s to describe better its resources. The park preserves steep-sided bluffs rising above the river and the narrow valleys between them, which support rare and fragile plant communities. Two of the bluffs have received further protection under the Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas program, which are known as King's and Queen's Bluff Scientific and Natural Area.\n\nThe region lies on sedimentary rock layers deposited on the floor of a shallow sea 500 million years ago. The lower, older layer is sandstone overlain by more recent dolomite rock. Much later a deep channel was carved into this stone by the ancient Mississippi River, which 10,000 years ago was greatly swollen from the melting glaciers to the north. The softer sandstone was eroded more easily, undercutting the dolomite on both banks of the river. The dolomite fractured off along vertical joints, leaving sheer rock faces still visible today. Side streams flowing into the Mississippi cut gullies into the river banks, creating a series of bluffs capped with erosion-resistant dolomite. Located in the Driftless Region of , the area was missed by the most recent Wisconsonian glaciation, and therefore is a region of deep river valleys dissecting the upland plains.\n\nIn the 1960s a state park was envisioned on the Mississippi river bluffs in the proximity of a highway bridge which carried many westbound travelers into Minnesota. Legislation authorizing a park was passed in 1963. The layout was a long, narrow strip along the blufftops between La Crescent and Dresbach, sandwiched between U.S. Route 61 at the foot of the bluffs and a county road atop them. To befit a roadside park, the state highway department was asked to provide a name. They suggested O. L. Kipp State Park after Orin Lansing Kipp, who had worked for them from 1916 to 1955 and helped establish the Minnesota state highway system. However, when the state contacted the current private owners of the designated land, they proved unwilling to sell their river views, and none of the property was ever acquired.\n\nHowever an alternative property to the north appeared which was both better shaped \"and\" already owned by the state. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Division of Forestry had been buying up lots in the region since 1962 for what was to become the Richard J. Dorer Memorial Hardwood State Forest. Legislation in 1971 transferred from the forestry division to the parks division, and O. L. Kipp State Park finally came into being. Development of the modest recreational facilities was slow, and the park officially opened to the public in 1976.\n\nEuropean settlers had cleared much of the land for farming, but this led to significant erosion on the steep slopes. The state forestry division had been planting nonnative as well as native trees to curtail the erosion and produce harvestable timber. Under the Division of Parks and Recreation, the plantations of nonnatives like red pine went against the policy of restoring a natural habitat. As a compromise, the nonnative trees are being harvested as they reach maturity and are being replaced with more appropriate vegetation.\n\nHigh up on the sides of several bluffs are rare habitats called goat prairies by locals, because they are so steep it would seem only goats could graze on them. These patches of prairie grow only on slopes between 40 and 50 degrees which face south to southwest. This orientation catches prodigious amounts of sunlight, which in winter means the ground thaws daily and freezes nightly, retarding the establishment of any woody plants.\n\nThe park also contains a relict stand of northern white cedar on Queen's Bluff, well south of its normal distribution. It arose during glacial periods and survived the subsequent warming of the local climate.\n\nDevelopment in the park was limited by the steep terrain and fragile habitats. Thus the roads and trails snake along the ridgetops and are fairly level despite the varied topography. The King's Bluff Nature Trail leads out onto King's Bluff (although the far tip is still privately owned). Other short trails lead out to viewpoints, some of the Mississippi River and Wisconsin shore, and some to goat prairies overlooking a narrow valley. Queen's Bluff and certain other areas of the park are off-limits except for research, due to the rare plants and treacherous slopes (in 1976 an early visitor fell to her death from Queen's Bluff). There is a picnic area whose tables are screened from each other by trees. The campground features 31 sites and a restroom with showers and flush toilets. The separate group camp can host up to 80 tenters. There is also a 5-site campground at the base of the bluffs for bicyclists traveling the Great River Road.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1902–1903 and was designed by the architecture firm of Henry Hertz and Hugh Tallant; the Roof Garden, where more risqué productions were presented, and which no longer exists, was added in 1904, designed by the same firm. The remainder of the building was utilized for offices.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1927, the theatre was the home of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\", whose producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., maintained an office in the building, and operated a nightclub on the roof. \"George White's Scandals\" and Eva LeGallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre were subsequent tenants. It was used as a movie theatre beginning in 1937, closed in 1985, and was leased by The Walt Disney Company and renovated by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in 1995–97 to be the flagship for Disney Theatrical Productions presentations on Broadway.\n\nBoth the Beaux-Arts exterior and the Art Nouveau interior of the building are New York City landmarks, having been designated in 1979. In addition, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nAlong with the Hudson and Lyceum Theatres, also built in 1903, the New Amsterdam is one of the oldest surviving Broadway venues.\n\nThe Beaux-Arts facade of the New Amsterdam is a narrow slice which leads to the theatre's interior, the first concrete example of architectural Art Nouveau in New York, The building was constructed in 1902–03 by the partnership of impresarios A.L. Erlanger and Marcus Klaw, was designed by architects Herts & Tallant and fitted 1800 people . Decorating was carried out by an extensive team of painters and sculptors that included George Gray Barnard, Robert Blum, the brothers Neumark, George Daniel M. Peixotto, Roland Hinton Perry and Albert Beck Wenzell. At the time of construction, it was the largest theatre in New York, with a seating capacity of 1,702.\n\nThe theatre opened October 23, 1903 with a production of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". For many years, it hosted the \"Ziegfeld Follies\", showcasing such talents as Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor, W.C. Fields, Marilyn Miller, Sophie Tucker, Eaton siblings and silent film star Olive Thomas whose ghost supposedly haunts the theatre.\n\nA racier sister show of the \"Follies\", the \"Midnight Frolics\", played in the New Amsterdam's Roof Garden theatre. The New Amsterdam was the scene of Marilyn Miller's greatest triumphs in the musicals \"Sally\" (1920) and \"Sunny\", which opened in September 1925 co-starring Clifton Webb as Harold Wendell-Wendell and ran for three seasons. But the theatre also hosted serious productions, and in June 1927 Basil Rathbone appeared there as Cassius in \"Julius Caesar\".\n\nThe premiere of the Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach scored \"Roberta\" starring Bob Hope, George Murphy, Fay Templeton and Lyda Roberti opened at the New Amsterdam November 18, 1933.\n\nThe Great Depression did much harm to the legitimate-theatre business, and in 1936 the New Amsterdam closed. It reopened on a limited basis in 1937 but was soon converted to a movie theatre. The New York City Industrial Development Corporation raised a bond issue to purchase the property in 1982 and retained title while responsibility for development and bond payment rested with the Nederlander Organization. In 1984, the Empire State Development Corporation and New York City Economic Development Corporation purchased the property. After having spent on the property, Nederlander announced in 1990 that it did not consider restoration of the property to be economically feasible; thereafter in 1992, a settlement was reached where the New York State Urban Development Corporation would take ownership and begin \"structural stabilization\" immediately through the 42 Street Development Project.\n\nDuring its years as a movie theatre, the Roof Garden was used as a rehearsal space for a number of shows, including the original Broadway productions of \"My Fair Lady\", \"Gypsy\" and \"Camelot\". In 1936, the theatre staged its last play, Sigmund Romberg's \"Forbidden Melody\", until Disney control.\n\nDisney Theatrical Productions signed a 49-year revenue-based lease for the property in May 1995, with Disney Development restoring the building. The theatre, which had recently been used as a filming location for the movie \"Vanya on 42nd Street\", was dilapidated; it would take several years, and millions of dollars, to restore it to its original use and grandeur. The roof garden remained closed when inspectors discovered that it could not meet modern building codes.\n\nThe New Amsterdam was officially reopened on April 2, 1997. In November 1997, after the premiere of the film \"Hercules\" and a limited engagement of a concert version of \"King David\", Disney's stage version of \"The Lion King\" opened. On June 4, 2006, \"The Lion King\" closed in The New Amsterdam Theatre, moving two blocks uptown to the Minskoff Theatre on June 13, 2006. \"Mary Poppins\" began previews at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 16, 2006 and opened on November 16, 2006, where it continued to run until March 3, 2013. The theatre was renovated to accommodate Disney's \"Aladdin\", which was mounted in the theatre in 2014.\n\nIn 2008, The Roof Garden and 42nd Street office tower were renovated to become the home offices for Disney Theatrical Productions.\n\n\"Aladdin\" broke the house record at the New Amsterdam Theatre for the week ending August 10, 2014, with a gross of $1,602,785.00. The previous record of $1,587,992.50 was set by \"Mary Poppins\" for the week ending December 30, 2007.\n\nThe New Amsterdam has also hosted events benefitting \"Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS\", including the annual Easter Bonnet Competition, until the event moved to the Minskoff Theatre. The New Amsterdam is now home to BC/EFA's annual Red Bucket Follies (formerly known as Gypsy of the Year Competition), the fall/winter sister event to the Easter Bonnet. In recent years, the benefit's honored guest had been centenarian Doris Eaton Travis, who originally performed on the New Amsterdam stage in the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1919\".\n\nIn 1999, the Backstreet Boys televised a concert for Disney Channel called \"Backstreet Boys In Concert\" from the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was a prelude to their 1999-2000 Into the Millennium Tour.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Thus, after Vasco Sports Club, Sporting became the second club of public shareholding in Goa. The club, built on the lines of Portuguese club Sporting Clube de Portugal, has made rapid strides in the national circuit. Sporting shot to prominence by an impressive performance in the 2001–02 Federation Cup, the team made it to the last four after victories over stronger teams like East Bengal and Indian Bank.\n\nSporting made its debut in the 2003–04 season of the Indian National Football League Premier Division, and were on the verge of winning their first league championship but lost out on the last day when Dempo pipped them to the title. Their season was marred by a horrific bus accident which ruled out 4 key players for the whole season, while several others were injured. However, led by Nigerian import Dudu Omagbemi, they managed to complete their matches in a very short span of time after being given a few weeks off so that their players could recover, and heroically came second ahead of traditional powerhouses East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Salgaocar and Mahindra United. Sporting entered the finals of 2005 Federation Cup, and emerged as the runner-up. In the following season, the club reached the finals once again, but lost in penalty shoot-out to Mohun Bagan. After getting relegated from the I-League in 2010 Sporting Goa participated in the 2011 I-League 2nd Division and won promotion by finishing in 2nd place.\n\nThe sporting crest is supposed to be almost an exact replica of the Sporting CP but not completely. One notable difference is that on Sporting Portugal's crest it says \"Sporting Portugal\" while Sporting Goa's does not. Another difference is that Sporting Portugal's crest is coloured in mostly dark green and yellow while the Sporting Goa crest is darkish green and white.\n\nWhile the crest of Sporting Goa is green and white the official colours of Sporting Goa are orange and white. The club nickname is the flaming orange. On the home kits Sporting wear an orange jersey with white shorts and orange socks while the away kit is all white but with an orange collar.\n\nTraditionally, Sporting Goa have played at the Fatorda Stadium in Margao, Goa. During the 2011 I-League 2nd Division however, they had to play at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Shillong as the league does not host matches in home and away format. As SC Goa are back in the top-tier of the I-League, they have again started to play their home games at Fatorda Stadium.\n\nOn 16 August 2013 Sporting launched their own football academy on the occasion of the 198th anniversary of founding of Don Bosco. The academy for various age groups, namely U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, U-18 and U-20, will have a coaching team built around Spanish coach Javier Fernández, who will be assisted by coaches Norbert Gonsalves, Ashwin Crasto, *Francisco Raposo and Freddy Gomes and will work under the overall supervision and guidance of Sporting's head coach Oscar Bruzon in order to implement the Sporting Clube de Goa youth development plan Sporting Goa also renovated the football ground at Don Bosco College in Panaji with the installation of sub-surface slit drainage combined with the laying of perforated pipes. The original mud topping has given way to a sand-based top layer, which encourages drainage and healthy grass growth, and provides a level and cushioned playing surface.\n\nSporting Clube de Goa launched its mascot named 'Zumba', besides its theme song 'Flaming Orange', composed by Goa's leading band Sky High with pomp.\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

He was most noted for being a US Representative, and was influential in attempting to impeach Andrew Johnson, creating the United States Department of Justice, helping to create the American Red Cross, and ratifying the Geneva Convention.\n\nLawrence was born on June 26, 1819 in Mount Pleasant, Ohio. He attended Tidball's Academy in Knoxville, Tennessee. After teaching at Pennsville and McConnelsville, Ohio, he was graduated in 1838 from Franklin College in New Athens, Ohio. He was then graduated in 1840 from law school at the University of Cincinnati, and was admitted to the bar. In 1873, Lawrence was awarded the LL. D. from Franklin College.\n\nIn 1841, Lawrence moved to Bellefontaine, Ohio, and there set up his law practice. From July 15, 1841 to July 15, 1843 he was law partner of Benjamin Stanton, and from July, 1851 to February, 1854 with his law student William H. West. From 1841 to 1843, he continued his studies, then in the field of medicine. In 1842, he became the Commissioner of Bankruptcy for Logan County.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1847, Lawrence served as the editor of the \"Logan Gazette\", which later became the \"Bellefontaine Examiner\". During this time, Lawrence was elected as the Logan County Prosecutor (in 1845). He also served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, in 1846 and 1847. In 1849, Lawrence was first elected to the Ohio Senate, serving until 1851 when he became the reporter of the Ohio Supreme Court. He returned to the Ohio Senate in 1854. He also served as an editor of \"Western Law Monthly\" from 1859 to 1862. In 1860 or 1861, Lawrence built a house along North Main Street in Bellefontaine; today, the William Lawrence House remains largely intact and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1857, Lawrence was appointed Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and of the District Court, serving until he resigned in 1864. In 1862, he entered the Union Army as colonel of the 84th Ohio Infantry, a three-month regiment. In 1863, Lawrence was appointed to serve as the wartime judge for the United States district court in Florida; however, he declined the appointment.\n\nOn March 4, 1865, William Lawrence was inaugurated as the U.S. Representative for the 4th district of Ohio, having been elected to this office the previous November. He supported the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, stating in an 1866 speech that it would \"protect every citizen, including the millions of people of foreign birth who will flock to our shores to become citizens and to find here a land of liberty and law.\"\n\nLawrence served in the Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-first Congresses, ending his third term on March 3, 1871. As Representative, Lawrence was among the authors of the bill of impeachment against U.S. President Andrew Johnson in 1868.\n\nIn 1867, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Lawrence directed an inquiry into the creation of a \"law department\" headed by the Attorney General and composed of the various department solicitors and district attorneys. On February 19, 1868, Lawrence authored the bill that ultimately created the United States Department of Justice. However, this first bill died in Congress due to the Congress's (and Lawrence's) concern with the impeachment of President Johnson.\n\nIn the following Congress, the issue was brought back to the table. Representative Thomas Jenckes of Rhode Island introduced a bill to create the Department of Justice on February 25, 1870. Though Lawrence did not write this bill, it incorporated many of the ideas from Lawrence's previous bill, and he gave the bill his full support. On June 22, 1870, President Ulysses Grant signed this second bill into law, creating the Department of Justice.\n\nReturning to Bellefontaine in 1871, Lawrence founded the Bellefontaine National Bank (acquired by Huntington National Bank in 1977), and served as its first president. He returned to Congress in 1873, this time from the 8th Ohio Congressional district. Lawrence served in the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Congresses, and completed his fifth and final term on March 3, 1877. During this service, Lawrence was the chairman of the Committee on War Claims arising from the American Civil War.\n\nLawrence was appointed by President Rutherford B Hayes in 1880 to serve as the First Comptroller of the Treasury, a post he held until 1885. Lawrence then appealed on behalf of Clara Barton to Hayes' successor, James Garfield, to support the creation of the American Red Cross on May 21, 1881. He then served as the organization's first Vice President. Lawrence and Barton were also instrumental in persuading the United States to ratify the Geneva Convention in 1882.\n\nIn 1891, Lawrence was appointed President of the National Wool Growers Association. He died on May 8, 1899 in Kenton, Ohio. Lawrence is interred at Bellefontaine Cemetery in Bellefontaine, Ohio. The small Ohio community of Lawrenceville is named for him.\n"}

It has various descriptions, all of which are of algorithmic nature, it has many remarkable properties, and it has applications in combinatorics and other areas such as representation theory. The correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways, notably by Knuth to what is known as the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence, and a further generalization to pictures by Zelevinsky.\n\nThe simplest description of the correspondence is using the Schensted algorithm , a procedure that constructs one tableau by successively inserting the values of the permutation according to a specific rule, while the other tableau records the evolution of the shape during construction. The correspondence had been described, in a rather different form, much earlier by Robinson , in an attempt to prove the Littlewood–Richardson rule. The correspondence is often referred to as the Robinson–Schensted algorithm, although the procedure used by Robinson is radically different from the Schensted–algorithm, and almost entirely forgotten. Other methods of defining the correspondence include a nondeterministic algorithm in terms of jeu de taquin.\n\nThe bijective nature of the correspondence relates it to the enumerative identity:\n\nwhere formula_2 denotes the set of partitions of (or of Young diagrams with squares), and denotes the number of standard Young tableaux of shape .\n\nThe Schensted algorithm starts from the permutation written in two-line notation\n\nwhere , and proceeds by constructing sequentially a sequence of (intermediate) ordered pairs of Young tableaux of the same shape:\n\nwhere are empty tableaux. The output tableaux are and . Once is constructed, one forms by \"inserting\" into , and then by adding an entry to in the square added to the shape by the insertion (so that and have equal shapes for all ). Because of the more passive role of the tableaux , the final one , which is part of the output and from which the previous are easily read off, is called the recording tableau; by contrast the tableaux are called insertion tableaux.\n\nThe basic procedure used to insert each is called Schensted insertion or row-insertion (to distinguish it from a variant procedure called column-insertion). Its simplest form is defined in terms of \"incomplete standard tableaux\": like standard tableaux they have distinct entries, forming increasing rows and columns, but some values (still to be inserted) may be absent as entries. The procedure takes as arguments such a tableau and a value not present as entry of ; it produces as output a new tableau denoted and a square by which its shape has grown. The value appears in the first row of , either having been added at the end (if no entries larger than were present), or otherwise replacing the first entry in the first row of . In the former case is the square where is added, and the insertion is completed; in the latter case the replaced entry is similarly inserted into the second row of , and so on, until at some step the first case applies (which certainly happens if an empty row of is reached).\n\nMore formally, the following pseudocode describes the row-insertion of a new value into .\n\nThe shape of grows by exactly one square, namely .\n\nThe fact that has increasing rows and columns, if the same holds for , is not obvious from this procedure (entries in the same column are never even compared). It can however be seen as follows. At all times except immediately after step 4, the square is either empty in or holds a value greater than ; step 5 re-establishes this property because now is the square immediately below the one that originally contained in . Thus the effect of the replacement in step 4 on the value is to make it smaller; in particular it cannot become greater than its right or lower neighbours. On the other hand the new value is not less than its left neighbour (if present) either, as is ensured by the comparison that just made step 2 terminate. Finally to see that the new value is larger than its upper neighbour if present, observe that holds after step 5, and that decreasing in step 2 only decreases the corresponding value .\n\nThe full Schensted algorithm applied to a permutation proceeds as follows.\n\nThe algorithm produces a pair of standard Young tableaux.\n\nIt can be seen that given any pair of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, there is an inverse procedure that produces a permutation that will give rise to by the Schensted algorithm. It essentially consists of tracing steps of the algorithm backwards, each time using an entry of to find the square where the inverse insertion should start, moving the corresponding entry of to the preceding row, and continuing upwards through the rows until an entry of the first row is replaced, which is the value inserted at the corresponding step of the construction algorithm. These two inverse algorithms define a bijective correspondence between permutations of on one side, and pairs of standard Young tableaux of equal shape and containing squares on the other side.\n\nOne of the most fundamental properties, but not evident from the algorithmic construction, is symmetry:\n\n\nThis can be proven, for instance, by appealing to Viennot's geometric construction.\n\nFurther properties, all assuming that the correspondence associates tableaux to the permutation .\n\n\n"}

He initially worked for Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling based in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1986 he began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida. Initially he worked as a singles wrestler, but it was not long into his tenure in Florida that the promoter and match makers decided to team Royal up with another young wrestler, Chris Champion; and together the two became a regular tag team called The New Breed. The New Breed tag team was given an elaborate back story and \"science fiction\" flavor as they were marketed as wrestlers sent back in time from 2002 to 1986. The duo was presented as having \"futuristic technology\", wore bright neon colored ring gear and unusual haircuts that were supposed to be the fashion of the future, and at one point had a robot as their manager. The team made various references to future events such as referring to wrestler Dusty Rhodes as \"President Rhodes\", indicating that Rhodes would win the 2000 presidential election. The team would come to the ring to the sound of the Beastie Boys' song \"Fight For Your Right to Party\". The team made a special appearance in Memphis, working for the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they lost to the MOD Squad on a show in the Mid-South Coliseum on September 1, 1986.\n\nOn December 25, 1986, the New Breed defeated Vic Steamboat and Kendall Windham in the finals of a tournament for the vacant NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, which had been inactive since 1981. After the title win the New Breed was put into a story line feud with the Face (those that portray the \"good guys\") team The Southern Boys (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers). The feud between the two teams led to the Southern Boys defeating the New Breed for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on February 11, 1987. Shortly after their title loss the New Breed left Florida.\n\nThe duo made their debut for National Wrestling Alliance Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which was in the process of expanding from the mid-Atlantic region to a national promotion. The team kept their futuristic gimmick and their Heel (those that portray the bad guys) characters as they were immediately put up against the popular the Rock 'n' Roll Express team of Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson, stating that they had been sent back from the future to save the fans from the Rock 'n' Roll Express, who would supposedly go crazy over what happened to Rock and Roll in the year 2000. They also claimed that in the future Jimmy Valiant had corrupted future Dusty Rhodes, leading to a dictatorship. mockingly calling him \"Father Time\". They also claimed that masked wrestler LazorTron was in reality a robot from the future, sent to stop them. In the spring of 1987 the New Breed was one of 10 teams competing in a tournament for the vacant NWA United States Tag Team Championship. The team wrestled the father/son duo of Bob Armstrong and Brad Armstrong to a draw, eliminating both teams from the tournament.\n\nThe story line with the Rock 'n' Roll Express was still in its infant stages when the New Breed was involved in a car accident and Chris Champion's injuries forced him to not wrestle for an extended period. Royal teamed up with Gladiator #1 and Gladiator #2, losing to the trio of Kendall Windham, Jimmy Valiant and LazerTron on the undercard on one of JCP's 1987 The Great American Bash series. JCP used the sympathy that Royal and Champion garnered from the car accident to turn the team into faces, as Jim Cornette, the manager of the Midnight Express tried to recruit Royal to his group, but Royal refused. During his recovering Chris Champion appeared on television with circuit boards and wires glued to his cast, making it look like it was a futuristic \"Healing device\". Once Champion returned to action the New Breed feuded with the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). The two teams clashed several times, often over the NWA United States Tag Team Championship where most of the matches ended inconclusively.\n\nIn an attempt to bolster the fan favorite image and congruent with their futuristic characters, JCP officials decided to give the New Breed a manager, a small remote controlled robot called \"XTC-1\" On November 26, 1987 the New Breed lost to The Sheepherders (Luke Williams and Butch Miller) for the UWF World Tag Team Championship as part of the Universal Wrestling Federation's Superdome show, losing to the defending champions. The New Breed broke up a short time after as Royal retired from full-time wrestling, opting to become a construction worker instead.\n\nRoyal made a return to pro wrestling in 1993, travelling to Japan to work for New Japan Pro Wrestling in the fall. Royal teamed up with Brad Armstrong to compete in NJPW's Super Grade Tag League III, a monthlong round-robin tournament NJPW holds each year. The duo ended the tournament with 0 points, losing to teams such as Jushin Thunder Liger and Wild Pegasus, The Barbarian and Masa Saito, Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami, Shiro Koshinaka and Michiyoshi Ohara, the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior), Tatsumi Fujinami and Osamu Kido, Masahiro Chono and Shinya Hashimoto as well as semi-finalists the Jurrasic Powers (Scott Norton and Hercules Hernandez) and tournament winners Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh. He wrestled his last NJPW match on November 4, 1993 as part of a special NJPW show in Sumo Hall. Royal teamed up with the Barbarian, losing to the Jurrasic Powers.\n\nIn 2001 Royal returned to pro wrestling, teaming up with Rusty Riddle to form a team known as \"Total Destruction\" in NWA Wildside. As a member of Total Destruction Royal once again plays a heel character, leading to a story line where the team was banned from NWA Wildside for 30 days. During that time period the team won the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship from Blackout (Homicide and Rainman) after a surprise challenge, but since the team was supposed to be banned from working in NWA Wildside they were forced to return the championship to Blackout a week later. The duo also had a long running storyline with The Kohl Twins. At the 2001 \"Freedom Fight\", Total Destruction challenged the Kohl Twins for the Wildside Tag Team titles, with Riddle also putting his hair on the line. Royal and Riddle lost and Riddle was shaved bald as a result. On August 8, 2001 Total Destruction defeated the NWA World Tag Team Champions The New Heavenly Bodies (Chris Nelson and Vito DeNucci) by disqualification and thus did not win the championship.\n\n\n"}

Later on, the magazine retracted this when the (still) unnamed official changed his story. A Pentagon investigation uncovered at least five cases of Quran mishandling by U.S. personnel at the base, but insisted that none of these were acts of desecration. The Pentagon's report also accused a prisoner of damaging a copy of the Quran by putting it in a toilet. In 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union, suing under the Freedom of Information Act, secured the release of a 2002 FBI report containing a detainee's accusation of ill-treatment, including throwing a Quran into a toilet.\nThis specific accusation had been made on several occasions by other Guantanamo detainees since 2002; \"Newsweek\"'s initial account of a government report confirming it sparked protests throughout the Islamic world and riots in Afghanistan, where pre-planned demonstrations turned deadly. A worldwide controversy followed.\n\nThe \"Newsweek\" affair turned the spotlight on earlier media reports of such incidents. Accusations of Quran desecration as a part of U.S. interrogations at prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as Guantánamo Bay had been made by a number of sources going back to 2002.\n\nThere were over a dozen pre-\"Newsweek\" reports in the mainstream media alleging U.S. Quran abuse, including the following:\n\nOn April 30, 2005, \"Newsweek\" magazine published an article claiming that an unnamed United States official had seen a government report supporting a \"previously unreported\" charge. Among the previously unreported cases that sources reportedly told \"Newsweek\": interrogators, in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Quran down a toilet and led a detainee around with a collar and dog leash. The prospect that U.S. personnel may have deliberately defaced the Quran provoked massive anti-U.S. demonstrations throughout the Islamic world, with at least 17 deaths during riots in Afghanistan.\n\nThe \"Newsweek\" article, by reporter Michael Isikoff, was one of over a dozen such reports of similar incidents that had surfaced in prior months in the U.S. and UK media, but the first involving a U.S. government source acknowledging an inquiry into the event. The Isikoff article was later retracted by \"Newsweek\", which nonetheless defended both its reporter and the story, stating \"neither we nor the Pentagon had any idea it would lead to deadly riots.\" The case turned the spotlight on other reports of desecration of the Quran at Guantánamo.\n\nThe article went largely unnoticed for five days. On May 6, Pakistani politician, Imran Khan, held a press conference. Khan criticized his country's government, saying, \"This war on terrorism is self-defeating if, on the one hand, you [Musharraf] are demanding that we help them and on the other hand, they are desecrating the book on which our entire faith is based.\" Khan's press conference was rebroadcast throughout the Muslim world.\n\nThe \"Newsweek\" report cited an anonymous source, said to be a senior government official, who claimed to have seen a confidential investigative report documenting the alleged incident — in which interrogators, \"in an attempt to rattle suspects, reportedly flushed a Quran down a toilet.\" However, on May 16, \"Newsweek\" retracted the statement that the abuse had been uncovered by an \"internal military investigation.\" after the source of the story was later unable to confirm where he had seen the information. In its May 23 issue, \"Newsweek\" stated that\n\n\"The New York Times\" quoted Isikoff as saying:\n\nOn May 10 and continuing the following week, many anti-American protests took place. In Afghanistan, demonstrations that began in the eastern provinces and spread to Kabul were reported to have caused at least seventeen deaths. The United Nations, as a precautionary measure, withdrew all its foreign staff from Jalalabad, where two of its guest houses were attacked, government buildings and shops were targeted, and the offices of two international aid groups were destroyed. Demonstrations also took place in Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, Pakistan and Indonesia, leading to the death of at least 15 people.\n\nWhite House press secretary Scott McClellan said, \"The report had real consequences, people have lost their lives. Our image abroad has been damaged.\" However, in a press release issued by the United States Department of State on May 12, General Richard B. Myers claimed that the \"Newsweek\" story was not a chief cause of the riots: \"He has been told that the Jalalabad, Afghanistan, rioting was related more to the ongoing political reconciliation process in Afghanistan than anything else.\" \n\nOn May 27, thousands of demonstrators gathered in what \"The New York Times\" referred to as \"waves of protest\" in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the Middle East, \"mostly centered on Friday prayer gatherings\". The \"New York Times\" reported that U.S. flags were burned at some demonstrations, and that, although most of the protests were peaceful, overt calls for an \"Islamic revolution\" were loudly supported by the crowds in Pakistan, further complicating a difficult political situation for General Musharraf.\n\nA Red Cross spokesperson Simon Schorno confirmed that U.S. personnel at Camp X-ray had displayed \"disrespect\" to the Quran, and that U.S. officials knew of this activity. Delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross informed U.S. authorities, who took action to stop the alleged abuse, said Schorno. He declined to specify the nature of the incidents.\n\nThe cousin of Shehzad Tanweer, who participated in the 7 July 2005 London bombing, claimed that Tanweer's ideology was reinforced by allegations of Quran abuse, \"incidents like desecration of the Koran\" had \"always been in his mind.\"\n\n\nOn June 3, 2005, a U.S. military investigation by the base commander, Brigadier General Jay Hood, reported four (possibly five) incidents of \"mishandling\" of the Quran by U.S. personnel at Guantánamo Bay. Hood said his investigation \"revealed a consistent, documented policy of respectful handling of the Quran dating back almost two and a half years.\"\n\nCBC News reported:\nAccording to the Hood report:\nThe report laid out the circumstances of these incidents and disciplinary actions taken. It also stressed that such mishandling was rare, and that guards were usually respectful of the Quran, following strict regulations the military laid down for handling the Quran.\n\nThe Hood report also listed 15 reported incidents of detainees mishandling their own copies of the Quran, including complaints made by other detainees.\nOne of these cases involved a prisoner \"attempting to flush a Quran down the toilet and urinating on the Quran.\"\n\nThe statement did not provide any explanation about why the detainees might have abused their own holy books.\n\nThe \"Newsweek\" article and the ensuing controversy turned the spotlight on other reports of Qu'ran desecration and spurred additional investigations by others. After a verdict by a federal court on May 25, 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained documents from the FBI interrogations of Guantánamo Bay detainees dating back to August 2002. The documents stated that some detainees had claimed to have witnessed Quran desecration (including \"flush[ing] a Quran in the toilet\"), among other acts, on many occasions by their guards — in a document dated August 1, 2002. The pertinent excerpt reads as follows:\n\nThe ruling of the court forcing the release of this and other documents came under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, in a news release, that \"The United States government continues to turn a blind eye to mounting evidence of widespread abuse of detainees held in its custody.\"\n\nThe FBI declared that it could not investigate the matter, as it was up to the Defense Department to do so. For its part, the Pentagon, through its spokesman Lawrence Di Rita, appeared to have transitioned from flat denials to vagueness and unsettled syntax: \"There have been instances, and we'll have more to say about it as we learn more, but where a Quran may have fallen to the floor in the course of searching a cell.\" Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters that \"past accusations have had credibility issues.\"\n\nJames Jaffer, an attorney working for the ACLU, was quoted by the \"New York Times\" as stating that errors in the \"Newsweek\" story had been used to discredit other investigative efforts conducted by his organization and other groups \"that were not based on anonymous sources, but [on] government documents, reports written by FBI agents.\"\n\nMany questioned the veracity of such accounts, noting that the FBI, in 2004, had released a captured Al-Qaeda training manual which Bush Presidency spokesmen claimed shows that Al-Qaeda members are trained to make false accusations once captured.\n\nSeveral reports have alleged a connection between events at Guantanamo Bay and a Department of Defense program \"Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape\" (SERE).\n\nOn May 16, 2005, Juan Cole published an email from a former SERE attendee who reported abuse of the Christian holy book in training.\nThe emailer had no direct knowledge of operations at Guantanamo, but noted that this tactic sounded similar to that alleged in the Newsweek story.\n\nIn July 2005, an article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine suggested that the SERE program involved a number of techniques which paralleled those allegedly used at Guantánamo Bay, including the desecration of religious texts. The writer contacted Juan Cole's anonymous source who said that in 1999 he attended a Navy SERE program in California.\n\nThe SERE program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for \"behavioral science consultants\" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy—although Banks has emphatically denied that he advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. However, General James T. Hill, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, confirmed that a team from Guantanamo went \"up to our SERE school and developed a list of techniques\" for \"high-profile, high-value\" detainees. According to an op-ed in the November 14, 2005 \"The New York Times\" by M. Gregg Bloche and Jonathan H. Marks, two lawyers with no first-hand knowledge of SERE, \"General Hill had sent this list -- which included prolonged isolation and sleep deprivation, stress positions, physical assault and the exploitation of detainees' phobias -- to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who approved most of the tactics in December 2002. Some within the Pentagon warned that these tactics constituted torture, but a top adviser to Secretary Rumsfeld justified them by pointing to their use in SERE training, a senior Pentagon official told us last month.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901059", "title": "The Invasion (professional wrestling)", "text": "The Invasion (professional wrestling)\n\nThe Invasion was a professional wrestling storyline in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) that ran from March–November 2001 and involved stables of wrestlers purporting to represent World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)—which merged to form The Alliance—placed against a stable of wrestlers purporting to represent the WWF. The storyline began shortly after the WWF's acquisitions of WCW and ECW in March and April 2001, respectively, and concluded with a \"winner takes all\" match between The Alliance and the WWF at Survivor Series.\n\nThe idea of a supercard featuring the two top promotions of the Monday Night Wars was considered to be a dream match scenario in the eyes of many fans, as it would allow the fans to see which promotion would be superior in storyline. The angle began when Mr. McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, announced as part of the storyline on WWF's \"Raw Is War\" and the final episode of WCW's \"Nitro\" (which merged into a simulcast) that he had bought WCW from under his father's nose. This led to several run-in appearances of WCW wrestlers during \"Raw Is War\" and \"SmackDown!\" over the months after WrestleMania X-Seven.\n\nIn June 2001, the angle grew in intensity as the WWF storylines somewhat abated to make room for the central Invasion storyline. WCW and ECW merged to form The Alliance and challenged the WWF's control over the wrestling industry. An Inaugural Brawl took place at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view, where Stone Cold Steve Austin defected and joined The Alliance. Many inter-promotional matches occurred after the Invasion between The Alliance and the WWF, leading up to the climax of the angle at Survivor Series, when Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, The Undertaker and Kane) defeated Team Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T and Shane McMahon) in a Winner Take All elimination tag team match.\n\nDuring the Monday Night Wars, the WWF and WCW, the two top North American wrestling promotions, competed for ratings. Through developments such as the creation of the New World Order (nWo) and the Montreal Screwjob, fans continually compared the two promotions, and the Internet wrestling community was full of debate as to which of the two was superior.\n\nAmong other factors, however, mismanagement within WCW (such as allowing wrestlers themselves to book matches and various instances of corporate politics) eventually led WCW to a downward spiral from which it never recovered. The Monday Night Wars came to an end on March 23, 2001, when the WWF bought the rights to WCW's video library, trademarks, 24 contracts for selected wrestlers, championships, and other properties (talent names, images, likenesses, slogans, rings, and belts) for what was considered to be a lower bargain price.\n\nThe final night of the Monday Night Wars occurred on March 26, 2001: \"Raw Is War\" primarily focused on the major storylines heading into WrestleMania X-Seven, while \"Nitro\" held their final episode with a \"Night of Champions\". Mr. McMahon opened up \"Nitro\" and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW. Throughout \"Raw Is War\", McMahon publicly named several WCW wrestlers who would not be retained. Though most would wrestle for the WWE in the ensuing years, he did legitimately fire Jeff Jarrett on TV due to animosity between the two dating back in 1999, when Jarrett blackmailed McMahon for payment when Jarrett was booked for a match at No Mercy when his contract expired the day before. After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCW's final match, the simulcast began. McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and toyed with the idea of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate, much like the WWF. He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction. Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans, and Hulk Hogan, Buff Bagwell, Booker T, Scott Steiner, Sting, and Goldberg received positive reactions. Vince then proceeded to fire them all, however, to the cheers of the \"Raw Is War\" crowd and the jeers of the \"Nitro\" crowd. McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania, on the condition that Ted Turner brings the contract for McMahon to sign personally. Shane McMahon, however, appeared on \"Nitro\" and announced in kayfabe that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW out from under his father's nose, planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity. The Invasion did not begin immediately afterwards, as the WWF was preparing for WrestleMania X-Seven, the year's largest show, which was mere days away.\n\nThe WWF had effectively doubled the size of its roster through its acquisition of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\n\nAs part of its plans, Lance Storm became the first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming, by performing a run-in during a match on the May 28 episode of \"Raw Is War\". Hugh Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4 episode of \"Raw Is War\" by attacking Edge. At King of the Ring on June 24, then-WCW wrestler Booker T interfered during the triple threat main event match for the WWF Championship and almost cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the title. Additionally, Austin legitimately suffered fractured bones in his hand from the side slam he took from Booker T into an announce table. The next night on \"Raw Is War\", which was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden, a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon. While Vince was in the ring, Booker T came from behind to deliver a scissor kick to Vince. The WWF roster ran to the ring to aid Vince, but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd. This incident marked the official start of the Invasion storyline; \"Raw Is War\" commentator Jim Ross announced, \"The battle lines have been drawn!\"\nWCW Tag Team Champions Chuck Palumbo and Sean O'Haire then made their WWF debuts on June 28, 2001, by invading SmackDown! and attacking the Hardy Boyz and Dudley Boyz during a tag team match, before fleeing after WWF wrestlers came after them in the ring. \nAs they were exiting the arena, they were attacked from behind by other WWF wrestlers led by Hardcore Holly and the APA, preventing what happened with the previous WCW wrestlers running to the arena exits undisturbed and rushing them back into the ring, where they were beaten up by WWF wrestlers. \n\nThe WWF eventually began to recognize WCW and tested the idea of a brand extension by giving WCW the final twenty minutes of \"Raw Is War\", with Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson as the announcers in place of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman. During a match between Buff Bagwell and Booker T for the WCW Championship, WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle and then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered in retaliation by beating Booker T up, with Bagwell joining Angle and Austin by attacking Booker T. This match was poorly received by the audience in attendance at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called the bout \"the worst match ever\". One source cited that the match should have showcased the best of WCW, but instead featured too many restholds and not enough action. The audience jeered the wrestlers with chants of \"This match sucks!\" and \"Boring!\" A WWF source close to Vince McMahon said that he \"absolutely hated\" the segment. In a podcast interview with Stone Cold Steve Austin in 2015, Bagwell expressed his suspicions of the WWF's true plans for the WCW product, stating his confusion as to why his match with Booker T took place in Tacoma, Washington (very much a pro-WWF area) instead of on the following week's RAW show at the Philips Arena in Atlanta (the former headquarters city of WCW), where the match likely would have received a more positive fan reception.\n\nUp until this point, the WCW contingent were being built up to being malcontent faces rising up against the heel Vince McMahon, because of Vince's bluster during the final \"Nitro\" broadcast and Shane's usurping of the WCW ownership. Originally, WCW talents were meant to attack strictly heel WWF wrestlers. The strongly negative reaction of the core WWF viewership to the WCW product and talent, however, coupled with the reality that a WCW wrestling program tailored to appeal to WWF fans would not come to fruition, led to the entire WCW contingent being abruptly turned heel. One example was the heel gimmick of then WCW Alliance member Diamond Dallas Page, whose first WWF appearance was built up over several weeks in a storyline in which he was portrayed as an anonymous stalker sending invasive videotapes to then-babyface, The Undertaker.\n\nOn the July 9 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Kane was scheduled to face Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in a handicap match. Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kane's partner, thus turning it into a tag team match. Near the end of the match, Jericho applied the \"Walls of Jericho\" on Lance Storm. As the move was being applied, however, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho. In response, WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz, Tazz, Justin Credible, Rhyno, and Raven (all former ECW wrestlers) ran to the ring. After a brief stand-off, the WWF cavalry turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho. This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring. After high-fiving the wrestlers, he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion. Heyman talked about how tired he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs. WWF, stating that he felt that everyone had forgotten about ECW and announced, \"This Invasion just got taken to the extreme!\".\n\nLater during the night, Shane and Vince McMahon bumped into each other backstage. Shane told his father that ECW needed to be taken care of and pointed out that there were ten ECW wrestlers under Heyman's belt. He suggested that WWF and WCW field five wrestlers each to take out ECW; Vince agreed, but he stubbornly insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all was said and done.\n\nAt the end of the night, the WCW wrestlers came into the ring, accompanied by Shane McMahon. The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and, before ECW entered, the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl. The WWF wrestlers cleared the ring, but then were stormed by the ECW wrestlers and taken out. The WCW wrestlers came into the ring, high-fived the ECW men and then dismantled the WWF wrestlers as Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon hugged in triumph. Upon seeing a stunned Vince McMahon asking what was going on, Shane admitted being responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance – with Stephanie McMahon as ECW's new owner.\n\nStone Cold Steve Austin, who had turned heel at WrestleMania and formed an alliance with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed from the threat of The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Austin played \"Kumbaya\" and \"We Are the Champions\" for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the \"old\" Stone Cold who was a \"beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB\" and the \"old\" Stone Cold that \"didn't take shit from anyone\". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, \"If you want Stone Cold to beat the living hell out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!\" to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.\n\nOn the July 16 episode of \"Raw\", Austin was shown drinking and playing pool at a bar downtown. During the night, Vince McMahon held a WWF meeting backstage. Undertaker and the APA gave a motivational speech on how they should not tolerate the Alliance any longer. After they were finished, Brooklyn Brawler wheeled Freddie Blassie into the room so he could address the wrestlers and pump them up for the night. As the WWF wrestlers united, Austin could be seen watching the events on the television at the bar. He proceeded to slam his cue stick on the pool table and left.\n\nLater that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, there was interference from the Alliance. In response, The Hardy Boyz, the APA, Jericho, and Kurt Angle came to help their WWF allies, but more Alliance members came in and overwhelmed the WWF wrestlers. Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF seemed to be on the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his cue stick and proceeded to beat down any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path. He then came to the ring, trash-talking on the way down, and beat down the Alliance wrestlers, giving Stunners to most of the men in the ring. The WWF wrestlers had cleaned house and were standing tall. The WWF seemed to be in good shape for the upcoming pay-per-view with Austin's return.\n\nAt InVasion, the Inaugural Brawl took place between Team WCW/ECW and Team WWF. Team WWF consisted of Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, and the Undertaker, who all squared off against the team of DDP, Booker T, Rhyno, and the Dudley Boys. Near the end of the match, all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle. Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T, who tapped out, but no referee was there to witness it. Austin then dragged a referee into the ring, but in a swerve, kicked Kurt Angle in the head, hit him with a Stunner, and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count. Team WCW/ECW won the match due to Austin's betrayal of the WWF.\n\nThe next night, Austin claimed he joined the Alliance because they appreciated him. He cited Vince's hugging of Angle and calling The Rock on the phone as signs that Vince did not appreciate Austin and accused McMahon of grooming Angle to be the next WWF Champion.\n\nOn the July 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Shane McMahon extended an invitation to The Rock, who had not been seen since the \"Raw Is War\" following WrestleMania X-Seven, to join the Alliance. Also that night, Kurt Angle challenged Booker T to a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match, which Booker T accepted. The WWF gained momentum when Angle made Booker T submit with an ankle lock, taking the WCW Championship away from the Alliance. Angle's title run proved to be short-lived, as Booker T won it back on the July 30 episode of \"Raw\".\n\nOn that same \"Raw Is War\" at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock returned for the first time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the \"suspension\" to take time off to film \"The Scorpion King\") on the April 2 episode of \"Raw Is War\". Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier in the year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, \"Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF,\" thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nHis return led to a WCW Championship match between The Rock and Booker T at SummerSlam, which The Rock won, marking the second time the WCW Championship belt changed sides to the WWF. At that same pay-per-view, Austin retained his WWF Championship against Angle after Angle won by disqualification.\n\nThe following \"Raw Is War\" and \"SmackDown!\" showings featured primarily interpromotional matches between the two companies. Austin stole Kurt Angle's medals during one of the shows, and on the August 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\", tied them to a cinder block and threw them in a river. On the following September 3 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Debra and Stephanie bought a new truck for Austin, but Angle came up from behind and nailed Austin in the back of the head with a pipe. He put a cinder block and rope in the truck, put Austin in it, and drove away on the truck. He blindfolded Austin and threatened to throw him into a river if he did not get a title shot. Austin, fearful for his life, \"broke down in tears\" and agreed to give Angle a title shot at the upcoming pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Angle said, however, that Austin was \"still going into the water\", but instead simply embarrassed Austin by throwing him into a kiddie pool.\n\nThe WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven, as The Rock retained the WCW Championship in a handicap match against Booker T and Shane McMahon, and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock, winning the WWF Championship from Austin, putting both belts into the hands of the WWF.\n\nAlmost every other championship had changed hands during this period of time, being exchanged between WWF Superstars and Alliance members. For example, The Undertaker and Kane beat Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon in a steel cage match at Summerslam to become co-holders of both the WWF and WCW Tag Team titles. Also, X-Pac beat Billy Kidman to become double champion of WWF Light Heavyweight Champion as well as WCW Cruiserweight Champion.\n\nThere were several interpromotional matches after Unforgiven. Furthermore, a crucial plot point formed when, on the October 8 airing of \"Raw\", Jericho and The Rock teamed up against Shane McMahon and Rob Van Dam. During the match, Jericho mistakenly struck The Rock with a steel chair, costing them the match. The Rock confronted Jericho backstage after the match, leading to a brawl between the two. The two of them began a feud, although they often tagged together, had similar gimmicks of hurling comedic insults at Stephanie McMahon, and at one point won the WWF Tag Team Championship.\n\nAlso that night, Steve Austin and Kurt Angle faced off for the WWF Championship, and then-WWF Commissioner William Regal, who sat at ringside to ensure a fair match would take place, hit Kurt Angle with the belt, thereby backstabbing the WWF and costing Angle the title. On the following October 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Linda McMahon promptly fired Regal from his position as WWF Commissioner, and named Mick Foley as his replacement. Regal was then declared the Commissioner of the Alliance by Shane and Stephanie.\n\nThe feud between Jericho and The Rock built up to a match at No Mercy on October 21, where Jericho beat the Rock to win the WCW Championship (Jericho's first world title), and Steve Austin defeated Angle and Rob Van Dam to retain his WWF Championship.\n\nOn the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", Shane McMahon told his father, Vince McMahon, that a member of the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night. Later that same night, Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho, The Rock, Undertaker, and Kane with steel chairs. On the following episode of \"SmackDown!\" on November 1, Angle, who originally led the WWF wrestlers, explained that he represented what is great about America—he was a winner, and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side. That side included Steve Austin, a man Angle claimed knew how to win.\n\nOn the November 5 airing of \"Raw\", Vince McMahon countered Kurt Angle's defection by stating that a member of Team Alliance would defect during a match at the upcoming Survivor Series. Steve Austin came out to confront Vince about it, and Vince stated that Austin would be the one to defect. Because of this announcement, many Alliance members began to distrust Austin, who vehemently denied the charges and called Vince a liar. Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance, questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down in a room with a light shining on him. That same night The Rock won the WCW World Title from Chris Jericho, but Jericho assaulted The Rock in the ring following the match.\n\nAll of this led to a Winner Take All match at Survivor Series 2001, which pitted Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and The Big Show) against Team Alliance (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon). The final three men in the match were The Rock and Jericho vs. Austin. Jericho was eliminated and, to continue the feud between the two men, attacked The Rock with a Breakdown, even though Jericho's future was on the line if The Rock lost. The Rock and Austin continued to battle it out, each stealing and reversing their signature maneuvers and the referee was knocked down in the match. Austin Stone Cold Stunnered the Rock and pinned him, but there was no referee to count it. Austin approached the downed referee to try to revive him. As this was occurring, Angle ran to the ring, picked up the WWF championship belt, and nailed Austin with it, revealing himself to be the defector to which McMahon was referring to the entire time. The Rock got up to his feet and followed this with a Rock Bottom and a pin on Austin, to which the referee woke up and groggily counted the three count. Team WWF prevailed, thus ending the storyline.\n\nIt was also on this night that several titles were unified; Edge defeated Test to unify the WCW United States Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, while The Dudley Boyz beat The Hardy Boyz in a Steel Cage match to unify the WCW Tag Team Titles with the WWF Tag Team Titles. The final ECW member, Jazz, made her debut during a Six Pack Challenge for the vacant Women's Championship, which was won by Trish Stratus.\n\nAfter The Alliance was disbanded, the WWF was faced with a title crisis; that is, they had too many championships (due to them acquiring all of WCW's championships), and each individual title became devalued. To combat this, the WWF began to unify many championships. Survivor Series 2001 saw two title unification matches: WCW United States Champion Edge defeated Test to become the WWF Intercontinental Champion, retiring the US title, while WCW World Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz defeated The Hardy Boyz to win the WWF Tag Team Championships, retiring the WCW tag titles. The following month at Vengeance, the WCW Championship (simply renamed the World Championship after Survivor Series) was unified with the WWF Championship in which Chris Jericho became the champion by defeating both The Rock and Steve Austin in a three-match tournament to form the Undisputed WWF Championship, which continued the lineage of the WWF Championship, while the former World Championship was retired. Another WCW championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, was rebranded as a WWF title (and later, WWE) and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. \n\nThe Undisputed Championship was originally represented by both the original WWF and WCW title belts, and the champion would carry both belts around until replaced with a single belt the following year on the April 1 edition of \"Raw\". At the beginning of the WWE brand extension, the Undisputed Champion would appear on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\" until then-champion Brock Lesnar signed an exclusive deal with \"SmackDown!\" after his victory over The Rock at SummerSlam 2002, thus making the championship exclusive to the brand. In response, then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff introduced the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the former WCW/World Championship belt, and awarded it to Triple H, who was the number one contender for the Undisputed title. The Undisputed Championship would be renamed the WWE Championship, as it was no longer undisputed as there were two world championships in the promotion. On the June 19 2003 edition of \"SmackDown!\", the United States Championship was revived as a SmackDown!-exclusive title, thus becoming the WWE United States Championship (and counterpart to Raw's Intercontinental title)—it is the only active title currently in the WWE to not have originated in the promotion.\n\nAlthough the WWF acquired all of WCW's championships, several were never used following the purchase of WCW, such as the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship and the WCW World Television Championship, which was quietly retired a year before WCW went out of business. Jim Ross made a passing mention of the WCW Hardcore Championship at WWF Invasion when mentioning all the titles Lance Storm had held in WCW, but the title never appeared during the storyline.\n\nAlthough Tazz briefly appeared on WWF television with the ECW Championship in 2000 (while under contract with the WWF) after reigning ECW Champion Mike Awesome unexpectedly signed with WCW, none of ECW's titles were shown on WWF television during the Invasion angle due to ECW's assets being held up in bankruptcy court; the WWE eventually purchased ECW's assets in 2003. Although the WCW brand effectively died once and for all following the end of the Invasion storyline, ECW was temporarily revived by WWE in 2005 for the purposes of a special reunion show, ECW One Night Stand, held on June 12, 2005. The build-up to this one-shot event featured former ECW talent putting over the virtues of the brand versus the WWE product and appearances by several former ECW wrestlers not under contract to WWE. In 2006, it was announced that WWE would be reviving ECW as its third brand (to complement Raw and SmackDown!). The second One Night Stand, held on June 11, 2006, led to the official debut of the new ECW the following Tuesday. Rob Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship for his victory in winning the WWE Championship over John Cena, thus officially reviving the title for the ECW brand, as well as the only wrestler to hold the ECW and WWE titles simultaneously. This was the only ECW title to be reactivated by WWE for the ECW brand. The brand would continue to operate until February 2010, when it was announced by Vince McMahon that \"ECW\" would be replaced by a developmental series for new talent entitled \"WWE NXT\", which eventually took the place of FCW (Florida Championship Wrestling), WWE's former developmental territory located in Florida. The ECW Championship was retired along with the closure of the brand.\n\nAlliance member Test won a battle royal at Survivor Series that featured both Alliance and WWF wrestlers battling for the right to be immune from termination for a year. Over the next several weeks Test began using that immunity to his advantage, attacking and bullying other wrestlers for no reason and often assaulting referees. Whenever he would be called on it, he would bring up his immunity from being fired. Shortly after Survivor Series, however, this was eventually forgotten.\n\nThe immunity was also extended to any Alliance member who held a championship at the conclusion of Survivor Series. Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was the WWF Champion, The Dudley Boyz, who held the tag team championships; Rob Van Dam, who was the Hardcore Champion, and Christian, who was European Champion also saw that extended to them. Of these wrestlers, everyone except RVD (who was already cheered by fans despite being in the Alliance) remained a heel after the Alliance. Also receiving immunity was Stacy Keibler the manager of the Dudleys, and Tazz who was a commentator on \"SmackDown!\" and had been kicked out of the Alliance several weeks prior.\n\nOn the \"Raw\" the night after Survivor Series, WWF Commissioner Mick Foley resigned. Vince McMahon celebrated his (assumed) complete and sole ownership of the WWF and his final victory over the Alliance, going on a power trip the entire night. His power trip included firing the Alliance's Paul Heyman from his broadcasting position and replaced him with a returning Jerry Lawler, who had been absent from the company since February. He later had his daughter escorted from the building by security (with his son, Shane McMahon, leaving the arena on his own accord). Perhaps his most egotistical move during this power trip was making Alliance commissioner William Regal become the inaugural member of the infamous Kiss My Ass Club in order to retain his job.\n\nMcMahon also announced that he would strip Alliance leader Steve Austin of his WWF Championship and award it to Kurt Angle, who had portrayed himself as the hero of Survivor Series the entire night and bragged about his actions in an egotistical matter to other face wrestlers, to which they all gave him negative reactions. This led to an upset Angle telling McMahon that nobody thanked him and appreciated him for his actions, which then McMahon told Angle that he would award him the WWF Championship. In doing so, McMahon completed a slow heel turn he had begun at the beginning of the night.\n\nBefore McMahon could announce Angle as his new champion, Ric Flair (who was making his return to the WWF after leaving in January 1993) announced that he \"bet on a winner\" at Survivor Series. When pressed, Flair revealed to McMahon that he was not in fact the sole owner of the WWF as he had originally thought. When Shane McMahon and Stephanie McMahon had bought WCW and ECW earlier in the year they had sold their shares in the WWF to \"a consortium\", and that Flair was the man who had bought them, making him half-owner of the WWF.\n\nImmediately after making the declaration Austin made his return and attacked Angle for costing him the win at Survivor Series against The Rock and also attacked Vince McMahon for attempting to strip him of his title, ending the heel run he had begun at WrestleMania. He turned face by aligning himself with Flair and reclaiming his WWF Championship belt.\n\nThe Invasion angle was a large storyline that spanned for almost half of 2001 and brought about financial success for the WWF, such as the InVasion pay-per-view being one of the highest non-major event buyrates in the history of pay-per-views. However, the Invasion storyline has come under criticism by wrestling fans and wrestling media, with the storyline being called a flop. Other media refer to the storyline as \"one of the most poorly handled, ego-filled storylines in wrestling history\".\n\nThroughout the storyline, many interpromotional matches had WWF wrestlers winning over WCW/ECW wrestlers, usually cleanly. In contrast, most of the Alliance's wins were controversial due to interference or disqualification. For example, it took Tazz assisting Raven at InVasion to beat William Regal. The Rock, however, won cleanly at SummerSlam, despite Shane McMahon's assistance to Booker T. A few other critics also noticed the overemphasis on Steve Austin. Critics believed that Austin was the only credible superstar in the Alliance.\n\nOne particular example of this was during the Inaugural Brawl at the InVasion pay-per-view. Besides Austin's turn in the match that was needed to secure a WCW/ECW win over the WWF, SLAM! Wrestling alleged that the Alliance wrestled poorly in comparison to the WWF wrestlers: Portrayed as disorganized and inferior grapplers, the ECW-WCW Team had more than its fair share of mistimed moves which hurt their own team members while the \"WWF squad\" of course wrestled like a well-oiled machine. The weakening of the ECW-WCW dubbed superstars didn't stop there either. The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not, the ECW-WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double-teaming or employing underhanded tactics. The message sent was loud and clear. The \"best\" of ECW-WCW is not good enough to hang with the WWF.\n\nIt has been speculated that the reason for this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while fighting the Alliance, as he worked very hard to put down his competition, especially WCW. Smash Wrestling alleges that WWF wrestlers needed to defect to make the Alliance appear to be a credible threat.\n\nThe Invasion storyline was presented with a backdrop of a McMahon feud. In the storyline, the WWF was owned by Vince McMahon, WCW was owned by Shane McMahon, and ECW was owned by Stephanie McMahon. Although the feud did not center completely around the McMahons, the family feud storyline had been done many times before. In addition to this, the Steve Austin versus Vince McMahon feud was to start again when Vince McMahon hit Austin in the back of the head with a chair at No Mercy. As stated by a SLAM! Wrestling synopsis of No Mercy: For fans who didn't catch it the fifth, tenth or twentieth time they've run the angle, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud once again... First up was Vincent McMahon labelling Austin with a steel chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away... Three minutes later, it was Shane McMahon's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post. Vince tackled Shane over the announce table and the two began pummeling one another. Back in the ring, Austin laid a \"Stone Cold\" Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled. Gee, how many times have we seen that scenario play itself out before? Austin wins. Vince fumes. Fans snore. Whatever.\n\nThe storyline also allegedly centered too much on the McMahons, who were getting more airtime than the wrestlers.\n\nMany fans had dreamed of a day where they could pit WWF and WCW wrestlers against each other, but the storyline's final match ended with four WWF wrestlers brawling it out. On TSN's \"Off the Record\", host Michael Landsberg asked Booker T why the Invasion – which he stated should have been one of the biggest money angles in wrestling history – was in his words a failure on pay-per-view. Booker responded: That wasn't the true WCW. I mean, we didn't have guys like Goldberg. We didn't have Sting. We didn't have Kevin Nash. We didn't have all the major players in the WCW to face the WWF superstars.\n\nSome of the WCW wrestlers' absences were out of the WWF's control. Many of WCW's top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner, WCW's parent company, and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money; Booker T, the reigning WCW Champion at the time of WWF's purchase, was a notable exception, agreeing to a buyout of the remainder of his contract with AOL Time Warner in order to wrestle for the WWF immediately. McMahon had the option of taking on any contract he wanted with his purchase, but chose to let AOL Time Warner continue to pay out what were considered bad deals. Ric Flair (who would appear on the \"Raw\" following Survivor Series) and Rey Mysterio were not signed until the end of the Invasion because they were tied to their contracts, and therefore their absence was out of the WWF's control. In addition, Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury. Others, such as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Goldberg, were not signed until well after the storyline finished. As for WCW's other top superstars, Sting was still under contract to AOL Time Warner, and did not join the now-WWE until late 2014, while Lex Luger and Randy Savage would never reappear in the company on TV (in May 2011, Luger rejoined WWE in a backstage role related to the company's Wellness Program, while Savage died of a sudden heart attack later the same month). Bret Hart, who made his name in the WWF but was last seen wrestling for WCW, was retired from wrestling due to his concussion he suffered in a match with Goldberg at Starrcade 1999 and estranged from Vince McMahon after the 1997 Montreal Screwjob; he would eventually return to WWE in 2010, having been inducted to the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Jeff Jarrett, despite his contract being dealt with WCW rather than AOL Time Warner, was another missing name as he was legitimately and publicly fired during the \"Raw\"/\"Nitro\" finale simulcast owing to disputes between Jarrett and McMahon that was not settled until 2018. Fans were confused by McMahon's decisions seeing as the WWF would make more than enough to cover all these wrestlers contracts in 2001. Because of this, the WWF's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW. \n\nIn correlation with WCW, ECW was also missing most of their key superstars such as The Sandman, Sabu, Balls Mahoney, Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke (all of whom would later join WWE's relaunched ECW). Other wrestlers such as Shane Douglas, Masato Tanaka, Terry Funk, New Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio and Mikey Whipwreck would also be missing from the storyline. During that period, the usage of the ECW name on-air was subjected to dispute despite Heyman still technically owning the company while the WWF faced legal action by Harry Slash & The Slashtones for the use of its theme song \"This Is Extreme!\".\n\nThe WWF itself would be missing some of its biggest stars, most notably Triple H, who tore his left quadriceps muscle on the May 21 episode of \"Raw Is War\", weeks before the start of the storyline and wouldn't return until the following year on the January 7 episode of \"Raw\", however he didn't compete as an in-ring competitor until the January 17 episode of \"SmackDown!\" in a tag team match and would also go on to win the main event a few days later at Royal Rumble 2002, well after the Invasion angle ended. Shawn Michaels, who was under a four-year retirement at the time, was on hiatus from WWF and also didn't appear during the Invasion storyline. Rikishi was inactive throughout the entire storyline with an injured shoulder, and didn't return to the WWF until December 2001. Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit who were former WCW/ECW stars, working for WWF at the time, were also absent from the storyline. Benoit was hinted to defect to WCW before his injury in June 2001 at King of the Ring. Guerrero was also hinted to defect to WCW but was sent to rehabilitation after an addiction with painkillers in May 2001 before being released that November. Both Guerrero and Benoit would not return to the company until April and July 2002 respectively. Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn, who were Benoit and Guerrero's former stablemates from The Radicalz were also absent from the storyline as well, with Malenko officially retiring from professional wrestling in July 2001 while Saturn was involved in a shoot incident during a \"Jakked/Metal\" taping and was minimally involved in the storyline.\n\nTo bolster the ranks of WCW (in lieu of big WCW names), some WWF wrestlers (such as Steve Austin) defected and joined the Alliance and were pushed as the leaders of the Alliance. Austin, who had worked in WCW and ECW but had found his greatest success in the WWF and was seen primarily as a WWF wrestler, was pushed as the leader of the Alliance and a more important player during the Invasion than the bona fide WCW or ECW members of the Alliance. Several top WCW and ECW talents who were top superstars in their previous companies, such as Diamond Dallas Page, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, The Dudley Boyz, Justin Credible, Raven and Tazz, were put down into low-mid card matches, while lesser-ranked WWF wrestlers who defected to the Alliance, such as Test, were given a greater push. Sting would cite this as the reason he would never sign with the WWF (until 2014) despite being offered a contract.\n\nIn the final Survivor Series main event between the WWF and the Alliance, the Alliance was represented by five wrestlers. Three of these were WWF wrestlers who had defected. Shane McMahon and Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for WCW or ECW prior to the Invasion. Only three wrestlers who had worked in WCW or ECW, Austin, Booker T and Rob Van Dam, were on the team. McMahon, Booker T and Rob Van Dam were the first three wrestlers eliminated on the Alliance's team, resulting in the last survivors representing the ostensible WCW/ECW entity being two wrestlers who were already in the WWF before the Invasion.\n"}

The allies start with no victory cities in their possession.\n\nInstead of purchasing units, players get them by placing units on \"Reinforcement Charts\" and then moving them to the play board.

The community is approximately 30 minutes from downtown San Diego. In 1989, the community was developed and later incorporated into the city of Carlsbad. As of 2005, it had a total population of 5,050.\n\nThe community is set in the hills of southern Carlsbad, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Batiquitos Lagoon. Aviara is just north of the city of Encinitas and west of the neighborhood of La Costa, also located in Carlsbad. The community is mostly residential except for the Park Hyatt Resort and Aviara Golf and Country Club. In the annual \"Forbes\" magazine ranking of \"Most Expensive Zip Codes\" in the U.S., Aviara's 92011 ZIP Code ranked among some of the most expensive in the nation. Many properties have views of the ocean, Batiquitos Lagoon, and Aviara golf course. The community is noted for its lush landscaping, gated communities, and abundance of jacaranda trees that frame many of the streets.\n\nDuring 2008, Aviara was the only community in San Diego County not affected by the housing crisis.\n\nTo preserve quality of life, the community council has numerous stringent ordinances, including laws against dead lawns, architectural styles, permanent basketball hoops and courts, satellite dishes and exterior paint colors. It is also a violation to leave trashcans on the street or in public view. With the exception of one community, Mirabella, multi-family housing is not permitted.\n\nThe community received some media attention in 2004 when a resident was arrested for defrauding an estimated $191 million from elderly people across the United States. Larre Jaye Schlarmann and three others were each ordered held on $144 million bail. In 2005 Schlarmann entered into a plea agreement, pleading guilty to money laundering and elder abuse.\n\nWell-known residents of the area include members of the Pulitzer family.\n\n\nAviara is located at .\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of .\n\nYounger children attend Aviara Oaks Elementary and Middle Schools while Carlsbad High School serves the older students.

It was produced by Kate Harwood, directed by Joe Wright and written by screenwriter Adrian Hodges, whose credits include \"David Copperfield\" and \"The Lost World\".\n\nIt covers the life of Charles II - beginning just before his Restoration to the throne in 1660. He was deeply traumatized by the execution of his father in 1649, after the former's defeat in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms; it begins, however, with his penurious exile in Antwerp in 1658. The film's emphasis is on his court, and his conflicts with Parliament - essentially the same issues which led to the Civil War between his father and the House of Commons, the politics of who would succeed him - and his relationships with his family, his mistresses and his illegitimate son James, Duke of Monmouth.\n\nThe film dramatizes both Charles's laziness and frivolous diversion, leaving political issues to his chancellor Sir Edward Hyde, but becoming increasingly irritated by the paternalistic way which Hyde behaves towards him. Dismissing Hyde, he takes the reins of power himself, determined that his brother should succeed him in the event of his not having any legitimate children (despite opposition to James's Catholicism), and that Royal Power not be challenged by Parliament.\n\nThe production won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial in 2004; it was also nominated for a minor Emmy (see the Internet Movie Database's entry).\n\nIt was shown in the United States under the title \"The Last King: The Power and the Passion of King Charles II\". This version, however, was heavily edited. The original British version is a four part series. For American broadcast, over an hour was edited out, and it was shown in two 90 min (with commercials, 2 hour) installments.\n\nThe edits often make little regard for either the script's continuity or coherence. Unless otherwise stated, items said to have been left out refer to the version shown in America and the DVD version available.\n\nMany things are left out including the full details of the Treaty of Dover which contained a secret clause wherein Charles promised Louis XIV, his first cousin, to convert to Catholicism for an enormous sum of money. Louis also promised six thousand French troops if Charles needed them.\n\nThe edited American version also leaves out Charles's trickery of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (played by Rupert Graves) regarding the treaty's secret provision. Thus, Buckingham's later opposition to Charles's insistence that his brother James (later James II played by Charlie Creed-Miles) inherit the throne appears to be motivated by merely spite and jealousy rather than a feeling of betrayal.\n\nJames's marriage to Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Hyde, made Earl of Clarendon by Charles in 1661, is also unexplained in the American version. Played by Tabitha Wady, Anne is only in two scenes, when Charles meets Catherine of Braganza and later, in conversation with Lady Castlemaine as the Queen \"took the waters\" at Tunbridge Wells, where many noble and wealthy women went to seek treatment for infertility.\n\nThe part where James and Charles are discussing James divorcing Anne was also removed, further confusing viewers not familiar with the history.\n\nThe conversations between \"Minette\" (Charles' sister Henrietta-Anne) and Louise de Kéroualle with Louis XIV (played by Anne-Marie Duff, Perkins Thierry, and Mélanie Thierry, respectively) are all in French with English subtitles in the British version. In the American version, only the conversation between Minette and Louis, where Louis asks Minette to act as his envoy to Charles is in English (perhaps because of the perception that American audiences dislike subtitles).\n\nAnother scene edited out shows \"Minette\"'s husband, the Duke of Orléans, called \"Monsieur\" (the traditional appellation for the King's eldest brother), a notorious homosexual libertine, battering and raping her after insulting her.\n\nAll in all, the cuts made by A&E distort the picture of Charles II's personality and political maneuvers whereas the version shown in Britain displays much more fully Charles II's \"shifty insincerity\" (as Will & Ariel Durant put in it \"The Age of Louis XIV\") and his willingness to sacrifice loyal servants at need. Indeed, the cuts seem to have been made with little regard for continuity or narrative coherence in the American version.\n\nThe American version presents Charles as the last \"absolute\" monarch of England. This does not dovetail with the historical reality (see the Durants and Fraser). In fact, Charles maintained his independence of Parliament in his last years only by taking French money. He also ensured his brother's succession to the throne not through royal command but through Parliamentary manoeuvres the nation's reluctance to see another civil war so soon after the First and Second English Civil Wars in the 1640s.\n\nThe full BBC version gives a more detailed, coherent presentation of the story of Charles' life and (temporary) victory over his opponents in Parliament.\n\nThree scenes of brief nudity were also removed.\n\nThe only version available on DVD in the US & Canada is the one broadcast on A&E. The British DVD retains the full BBC version. Due to technical reasons, the most important impediment being the different television formats used in the two countries, see PAL and NTSC; also (see DVD article for further details on controversial \"copy protection\" measures), the British version cannot be readily viewed with the vast majority of American set-top DVD players. The aforementioned television format differences also make viewing a VHS copy of the British version difficult on US and Canadian TVs.\n\nThe production team and the writer made an attempt to make this version as close to history as the constraints of squeezing 27 years of history into 4 hours allow. The script appears to be heavily influenced by Antonia Fraser's bestselling 1979 biography \"Charles II\". In the \"Making of Charles II\" Rufus Sewell states that he used Fraser's book as guide to his portrayal of the penultimate Stuart king.\n\nThere are some issues of fact which are altered or omitted in the script.\n\n\nThere are also certain omissions in the script.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901100", "title": "Rendzina", "text": "Rendzina\n\nRendzina (or \"rendsina\") is a soil type recognized in various soil classification systems, including those of Britain and Germany as well as some obsolete systems. They are humus-rich shallow soils that are usually formed from carbonate- or occasionally sulfate-rich parent material. Rendzina soils are often found in karst and mountainous regions.\n\nThe term \"rendzina\" originated via Russian from the Polish \"rędzina\", of unknown origin.\n\nIn the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, rendzina soils would be classified as leptosols, chernozems, kastanozems, or phaeozems, depending on their specific characteristics.\n\nRendzina soils typically develop from solid or unconsolidated rocky material that is carbonate- or sulphate-rich. Limestone is by far the most common, but others include dolomite, gypsum, marble, chalk and marlstone.\nAlongside physical weathering, which breaks down the structure of rocky material, chemical weathering, in particular the dissolution of carbonate, contributes to rendzina development. When water with dissolved carbon dioxide comes into contact with carbonate minerals, the carbonate is dissolved and leaches out with the water. The overall reaction is as follows:\n\nCaCO(s) + HO(l) + CO(aq) → 2 HCO(aq) + Ca(aq)\n\nLoss of soluble minerals leaves the upper part of the soil enriched in insoluble materials, particularly clay minerals. At the same time, biological activity leads to an accumulation of humus in the surface soil, which is protected from further decomposition by the clay. The upper soil horizon of a rendzina therefore contains considerable amounts of humus. It can also be relatively carbonate- or gypsum-rich, although at levels much lower than in the rocky parent material.\nProgressive breakdown of the parent material and loss of carbonate or gypsum will ultimately convert a rendzina into another soil type. Since these processes occur relatively fast in comparison to weathering of most carbonate- and gypsum-free materials, rendzinas represent a transitory stage in soil development. However, they can persist over the long term if soil loss by erosion counteracts the soil development process.\n\nTypical areas for rendzina soils are in karst and mountain landscapes, where carbonate-rich material occurs on slopes. They are common in scarpland, wherever limestone is exposed. The rendzinas in Wales, for example constitute a simple A-C profile, a dark calcareous topsoil immediately over shattered limestone.\n\nThe combined effects of clay and humus content produce dark colours and crumb structure. Typical pH for Rendzina soils is between 5 and 8, and base saturation is high. Calcium and magnesium are abundant, but potassium content is often low, so nutrient imbalances are common.\n\nRendzina soils are usually poorly suited to agricultural use. Mechanical tillage is hindered by their shallowness, and the small soil volume limits their capacity to store and supply water. Additionally, these soils often occur on slopes, where the risk of erosion is high. As a result, there is much semi-natural vegetation to be found in these areas.\n\n"}

W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. It is located along the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast United States, on Walker's Point (previously known as Point Vesuvius and home to a Kennebunkport city park called \"Damon Park\").\n\nWalker's Point juts out into the ocean in southern Maine, in the town of Kennebunkport, approximately midway between the cities of Portland, Maine, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The property has been a family retreat for more than a century, starting with Bush's maternal grandfather \n\nThe estate was purchased in the late 19th century jointly by Bush's great-grandfather David Davis Walker, and his son, St. Louis banker George Herbert \"Bert\" Walker. Both built mansions on the point in 1902. D. D. Walker's mansion has since been torn down. In 1921, Dorothy Walker and Prescott Bush were married, and Bert Walker built a \"bungalow\" on the Point and gave it to them as a wedding present. When Bert died in 1953, his son, George Herbert Walker Jr. (\"Herbie\"), purchased the property from his father's estate. It was not willed to him. Upon the death of Herbie in 1977, the property again went up for sale and was purchased by Herbie's nephew, George H. W. Bush. The estate has since remained in the Bush family.\n\nPresident Bush spent much of his childhood at the Kennebunkport estate. As an adult, Bush, his wife Barbara, and their children George W., Jeb, Marvin, Neil, Dorothy, and Robin spent most summers at the estate. The estate has been a backdrop of family weddings, holidays, and receptions. While at the \"Summer White House,\" Bush hosted world leaders including Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev for informal and private meetings. As a young man, Bush relocated to Houston, Texas; eventually the Bushes maintained a working residence in Tanglewood, where they spent most of their time.\n\nGeorge H. W. wrote of his memories there to \"Portland Magazine\" in 1997 after reading the article \"Inventing the Campbells.\" The Campbells were the heirs to the Palm Beach clothing fortune and had a home in the Kennebunks. \"I really enjoyed that article about the Campbells by Colin Sargent, July/August 1997). I remember Connie, Babs, and Bill—remember them well and very favorably. Connie was the glamour girl, all right. When she would flash by in that neat little Chris Craft, blonde hair flying, all us little guys, who were madly in love with her—from afar, that is—used to sigh and dream. We would hang around hoping that this the most glamorous of women would give us a ride in that flashy boat. Barbara was a wonderful girl, too. Just my age—so my friends and I were not quite as intimidated by her as we were by the slightly older Connie. Anyway, your story brought back many happy memories ... President George Bush, Houston, Texas\"\n\nBush's son, the 43rd President, George W. Bush, visits with family in Kennebunkport several times a year. His \"Summer White House\" also known as the \"Western White House,\" was the Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas.\n\nThe estate is situated on a promontory of land called Walker's Point which juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. The large central house, built in the New England shingle style, has nine bedrooms, four sitting rooms, an office, a den, a library, a dining room, a kitchen, and various patios and decks. Next to the main house are a four-car garage, a pool, tennis court, dock, boathouse, and guesthouse. There are spacious lawns on either side of the house, on which there is a small sportsfield.\n\nThe entrance is gated and guarded by Secret Service officers, though visitors can see the driveway leading up to the main house and a circular driveway, in the middle of which is a large flagpole flying the American flag. When either President Bush was present at the compound while in office, the Presidential flag was hoisted below the national colors; the flagpole was a popular backdrop for television journalists during the elder Bush's presidency.\n\nThe home and contents were substantially damaged by a strong series of storms in late October 1991. The damage was estimated at $300,000–$400,000 and the President did receive an undisclosed amount in flood insurance, but failed to take the full deduction for storm damage on his 1991 tax return to avoid a conflict of interest as he was the one responsible for declaring Maine as a 'disaster area'.\n\nIn 2015, it was reported that Jeb Bush was building a home on Walker's Point.\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.\n\nThe property includes a 72,299 square-foot casino along with 3,460 hotel rooms. The architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach. Staying true to its theme and name, the hotel includes a garden courtyard which serves as a wildlife habitat for flamingos. The hotel was the third resort to open on the Strip and remains the oldest resort on the Strip in operation today, and it has been since 2007 with the closure and demolition of The New Frontier. It is also the last remaining casino on the strip that opened before 1950 that is still in operation. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station called the Flamingo & Caesars Palace station at the rear of the property. After opening in 1946, it has undergone a number of ownership changes.\n\nThe Flamingo site occupies 40 acres originally owned by one of Las Vegas' first settlers, Charles \"Pops\" Squires. Squires paid $8.75 an acre for the land. In 1944, Margaret Folsom bought the tract for $7,500 from Squires, and she then later sold it to Billy Wilkerson. Wilkerson was the owner of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" as well as some very popular nightclubs in the Sunset Strip: Cafe Trocadero, Ciro's and La Rue's (Hollywood).\n\nIn 1945, Wilkerson purchased 33 acres on the east side of U.S. Route 91, or about a mile south of the Hotel Last Frontier, in preparation for his vision. Wilkerson then hired George Vernon Russell to design a hotel influenced by European style. Wilkerson also requested that the hotel be different than the \"sawdust joints\" on Fremont Street. He planned a hotel with luxurious rooms, a spa, a health club, a showroom, a golf course, a nightclub, an upscale restaurant and a French style casino. Because of high wartime material costs, Wilkerson ran into financial problems almost at once, finding himself $400,000 short and hunting for new financing.\n\nIn late 1945, mobster Bugsy Siegel and his partners came to Las Vegas. Vegas reportedly piqued Siegel and his mob's interest because of its legalized gambling and off-track betting. At the time, Siegel held a large interest in Trans America Wire, a racing publication.\n\nSiegel began by purchasing El Cortez on Fremont Street for $600,000. His expansion plans were hampered by unfriendly city officials aware of his criminal background, so Siegel began looking for a site outside the city limits. Hearing that Wilkerson was seeking extra funding, Siegel and his partners posed as businessmen and directly bought a two-thirds stake in the project.\n\nSiegel took over the final phases of construction and convinced more of his underworld associates, such as Meyer Lansky to invest in the project. Siegel reportedly lost patience with the project's rising costs, and he once mentioned to his builder, Del Webb, that he had personally killed 16 men. Reportedly, when Webb appeared scared upon hearing that, Siegel reassured him, \"Don't worry – we only kill each other.\"\n\nSiegel had also built a secret ladder in the \"Presidential Suite\" to escape if necessary. The ladder led down to an underground garage where a chauffeured limo was always waiting.\n\nSiegel finally opened The Flamingo Hotel & Casino on December 26, 1946, at a total cost of $6 million. Billed as \"The West's Greatest Resort Hotel\", the 105-room property – and first luxury hotel on the Strip – was built from Downtown Las Vegas. During construction, a large sign announced the hotel as a William R. Wilkerson project. The sign also read Del Webb Construction as the hotel's primary contractor and Richard R. Stadelman (who later made renovations to the El Rancho Vegas) as the building architect.\n\nAllegedly, Siegel named the resort after his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, who loved to gamble and was nicknamed \"Flamingo\". It is reported that Siegel called her this because of her long, skinny legs. Organized crime king, Lucky Luciano, wrote in his memoir that Siegel once owned an interest in the Hialeah Park Race Track and viewed the flamingos who populated nearby as a good omen. The \"Flamingo\" name is reported to have been given to the project at its inception by Wilkerson.\n\nSiegel's trouble with the Flamingo began when, a year after its official groundbreaking, the resort had produced no revenue and drained the resources of its mob investors. Then Meyer Lansky charged – at a major mob conference in Cuba – that either Siegel or Hill was skimming from the resort's building budget. This charge was amplified at a time when Hill was revealed to have taken $2.5 million and had gone to Switzerland, where the skimmed money was believed to be going.\n\n\"There was no doubt in Meyer's mind,\" Luciano recalled in his memoir, \"that Bugsy had skimmed this dough from his building budget, and he was sure that Siegel was preparing to skip as well as skim, in case the roof was gonna fall in on him.\" Luciano and the other mob leaders in Cuba asked Lansky what to do. Torn because of long ties to Siegel, whom he considered like a brother, Lansky nevertheless agreed that someone stealing from his friends had to die. At first, Lansky persuaded the others to wait for the Flamingo's casino opening: if it was a success, Siegel could be persuaded in other ways to repay. Luciano concurred and persuaded the others to agree.\n\nThe splashy opening – stars present included Spanish band leader Xavier Cugat (whose band provided the music), George Jessel, George Raft, Rose Marie, and Jimmy Durante as entertainment, with guests including Clark Gable, Lana Turner, Cesar Romero, Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, and others – was a flop. Lansky managed to persuade the mob chiefs to reprieve Siegel once more and allow the Flamingo more time. But by January 1947 Siegel had to order the resort closed until the hotel could be finished.\n\nThe Flamingo re-opened in March despite the hotel not being complete, and this time, the results proved different. By May, the resort reported a $250,000 profit, allowing Lansky to point out that Siegel was right about Las Vegas after all. But it wasn't quite enough to save Siegel. On June 20, 1947, relaxing in the Beverly Hills house he shared with Hill, who was away at the time, Siegel was shot to death.\n\nA memorial plaque exists on the Flamingo site near the outdoor wedding chapel.\n\nCasino management changed the hotel name to The Fabulous Flamingo on March 1, 1947. After Siegel's death, Moe Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, magnates of the nearby El Cortez Hotel, took possession of it. Under their partnership, it became a non-exclusive facility affordable to almost anyone. They made the enterprise extremely successful. In the year 1948 alone, it turned a $4 million profit. The Fabulous Flamingo presented lavish shows and accommodations for its time, becoming well known for comfortable, air conditioned rooms, gardens, and swimming pools. Often credited for popularizing the \"complete experience\" as opposed to merely gambling, its staff became known for wearing tuxedos on the job. Among the many entertainers who performed there between 1947 and 1953 were Martin and Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Danny Thomas, Tony Martin, Marge and Gower Champion, Polly Bergen, Lena Horne, The Mills Brothers, Alan King, Betty Hutton, Billy Eckstine, Sophie Tucker, Pearl Bailey, and Spike Jones. Rose Marie, who was one of its first entertainers under Siegel's ownership in 1946, remained loyal to the property for the rest of her life, only performing at other casinos with permission from \"the boys\" at the Fabulous Flamingo, according to her last words.\n\nIn 1953, the hotel's management spent $1 million in renovations and remodeling. The original entrance and signage was destroyed. A new entrance with an upswept roof was built and a pink neon sign was designed by Bill Clark of Ad-Art. A neon-bubbled \"Champagne Tower\" sign with pink flamingos rimming the top was also installed in front of the hotel. From 1955 to 1960, the property was operated by Albert Parvin of the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation. Parvin owned 30% of the stock while businessman Harry Goldman owned 7.5%; other investors included singer Tony Martin and actor George Raft.\n\nIn 1960, it was sold for $10.5 million to a group including Samuel Cohen, Morris Lansburgh, and Daniel Lifter, Miami residents with reputed ties to organized crime. Lansky allegedly served as middleman for the deal, receiving $200,000.\n\nKirk Kerkorian acquired the property in 1967, making it part of Kerkorian's International Leisure Company, but the Hilton Corporation bought the resort in 1972, renaming it the Flamingo Hilton in 1974. The last of the original Flamingo Hotel structure was torn down on December 14, 1993, and the hotel's garden was built on-site. The Flamingo's four hotel towers were built (or expanded) in 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1990, and 1993. A 200-unit Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare tower was opened in 1993.\n\nIn 1998, Hilton's gaming properties, including the Flamingo, were spun off as Park Place Entertainment (later renamed to Caesars Entertainment). The deal included a two-year license to use the Hilton name. Park Place opted not to renew that agreement when it expired in late 2000, and the property was renamed Flamingo Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2005, Harrah's Entertainment purchased Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and the property became part of Harrah's Entertainment company. The company changed its name to Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2010.\n\nOn September 9, 2012, Port Adelaide Football Club AFL footballer John McCarthy died after falling from a rooftop of the hotel. The incident occurred at the start of a post-season holiday for McCarthy and other Port Adelaide players. They had arrived in Las Vegas only a few hours before the incident. After reviewing evidence, police said that McCarthy had attempted to jump off the roof onto a palm tree, but fell to the ground.\n\nThe hotel underwent a $90M makeover which was completed in 2018. The designer, Forrest Perkins, used gold and pink in the 3500 upgraded rooms and described them as contemporary retro-chic with a focus on the 70-year history of the hotel.\n\nThe 15-acre site's architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach, with a garden courtyard housing a wildlife habitat featuring flamingos. It was the third resort to open on the Strip, and it is the oldest resort on the Strip still in operation today. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station, the Flamingo/Caesars Palace station, at the rear of the property.\nThe garden courtyard houses a wildlife habitat featuring Chilean flamingos, Ringed Teal ducks, and other birds. There are also koi fish and turtles. It was the home of penguins, but they have since been moved to the Dallas Zoo. Extending the hotel's tropical theme, a Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville restaurant and gift shop was opened in December 2003. An adjacent Margaritaville \"minicasino\" opened in October 2011.\n\nHeadlining acts perform in the \"Donny and Marie\" Showroom. The throwback venue was remodeled in 2014 that included many technological updates improving the sound systems and lighting. It seats 780 with floor seating and a balcony. It maintains the style and feel of early Vegas with red and white themed booths and chairs, red velvet curtains as well as red carpets. It provides for close intimate interactions between the performers and audience due to the clam-shell layout. It was officially named the \"Donny & Marie Showroom at Flamingo Las Vegas\" after the Brother and Sister duo that headlined for an eleven-year span between 2008 and 2019. Starting late November 2019 the “Donny & Marie Showroom” went back to its original name “Flamingo Showroom”. \n\nThe theater \"Bugsy's Cabaret\" host the show \"X Burlesque\" which debuted in 2002. In addition the Piff X-Perience uses the same stage.\n\nPaula Abdul began a residency on August 13, 2019 with her Forever Your Girl production and is currently scheduled through January 4, 2020. Alongside Paula Abdul's residency, RuPaul's Drag Race Live! will also debut on January 2020, featuring drag queens that once competed on RuPaul's Drag Race and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars such as Aquaria, Derrick Barry, and Yvie Oddly.\n\nFrom 2008 through November 2019 the headlining show at the Flamingo featured brother-sister musical duo Donny and Marie Osmond. Their show premiered in September 2008, and was extended through November 2019 for an eleven-year run. The show was rated in The Best of Las Vegas online contest. Donny and Marie Osmond were voted \"Best Performers of Las Vegas\" in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The final show was on November 16, 2019 and holds the record for the longest running musical act in Vegas history with 1730 performances with more than 9 million tickets sold during the production.\n\nEarlier headliners include Gladys Knight in 2003 with her Knight in Vegas residency. Toni Braxton's show ran from August 2006 to April 2008 and closed due to Braxton's health problems. Singer Olivia Newton-John maintained a long term residency at the Flamingo from April 2014 through 2016.\n\nAdditional past performers at The Flamingo include Judy Garland in '58, Bobby Darin in '63 (for several weeks), Fats Domino in '63 (and for several years), Jerry Lee Lewis in '63, and Ray Charles in '63. The Supremes in '66, James Brown in '67, Little Richard in '67, Tom Jones in '68 (for the album \"Tom Jones Live in Las Vegas\"), Wayne Newton (longtime Vegas resident) in '68, Ella Fitzgerald in '70, B.B. King in '71, Kenny Rogers in '97, Foreigner in '00, Vinnie Favorito in '03, The Beach Boys in '03, Jimmy Buffett in '04, Sly & the Family Stone (from San Francisco) in '07, Old Dominion in '17, Aaron Carter in '17, Everclear in '17, Lit and Alien Ant Farm (both from L.A.) in '17, Richard Marx in '17, Smash Mouth (from San Jose) in '17. Rita Ora in '18, and Gin Blossoms (from Phoenix) in '18.\n\nThe 1964 film \"Viva Las Vegas\" and the 1960 version of \"Ocean's 11\" were filmed at the hotel, as was a flashback sequence from the 2001 version of the latter film. In the 1960 version, the Flamingo was one of the five Las Vegas casinos robbed by characters played by Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr. and others.\n\nThe 1991 film \"Bugsy\" starring Warren Beatty depicted Bugsy Siegel's involvement in the construction of the Flamingo, though many of the details were altered for dramatic effect. For instance, in the film, Siegel originates the idea of the Flamingo, instead of buying ownership from Billy Wilkerson, and is killed after the first opening on December 26, 1946, rather than the second opening of the Flamingo in 1947.\n\nThe Netflix original series \"Lilyhammer\" featuring E-Street Band guitarist and singer Steven Van Zandt features a nightclub in Lillehammer, Norway, named the Flamingo. During its construction, Van Zandt's character, Giovanni Henriksen (aka Frank \"The Fixer\" Tagliano), referenced the hotel and casino, as well as Benjamin Siegel, as his inspiration for the nightclub.\n\nIn the television series \"Vega$\" (1978-1981), starring Robert Urich, and filmed entirely in Las Vegas, the Flamingo Hilton is featured prominently in the opening montage.\n\nThe debut solo album from The Killers' lead singer Brandon Flowers, \"Flamingo\", is named after the casino.\n\nHunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acosta stayed at the Flamingo while attending a seminar by the National Conference of District Attorneys on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs held at the Dunes Hotel across the street. Several of their experiences in their room are depicted in Thompson's \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream\".\n\nThe Flamingo figures prominently in the Tim Powers novel \"Last Call\". In the novel, the Flamingo is supposedly founded on Siegel's mythical/mystical paranoia of being pursued and killed for his archetypal position as the \"King of the West\", known mythologically as \"Fisher King\". Supposedly the Flamingo itself was meant to be a real-life personification of \"The Tower\" card of the tarot deck.\n\n\n"}

He went through several names, such as \"Man Mountain Harris,\" \"Hangman Harris,\" and \"Hangman Ricky Harris\".\n\nIn 1981, Harris competed as a preliminary wrestler on the Jim Crockett Promotions \"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\" program as \"Ricky Harris\".\n\nIt was during his \"Hangman\" Rick Harris phase, working for Bill Watts, that he debuted as a bounty hunter for Skandor Akbar in 1982 Mid South Wrestling and before settling on the name of \"Black Bart\" which was given to him by Dusty Rhodes in 1984.\n\nHarris formed a tag team called the \"Long Riders\" with Ron Bass in Florida Championship Wrestling in 1984 and they would hold the NWA United States Tag Team Titles (Florida) and work a program with Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda and went on to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions later that year and were managed by J.J. Dillon.\n\nAfter splitting with Bass in 1985, Harris feuded with Ron Garvin, Terry Taylor and Sam Houston over the NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship which he won and defended. During this time Black Bart developed his second-rope leg drop to a prone opponent finishing move known as the \"Texas Trash Compactor\".\n\nIn late 1986, Bart went to World Class Championship Wrestling where he feuded with Chris Adams and Kevin Von Erich over the World Class title. When Adams, who held the World Class title, left the promotion in September 1986, Bart was awarded the championship...but not before the promotion explained that Bart won the belt from Adams in a fictitious match held in Los Angeles. Bart lost the championship to Von Erich a month later in Dallas, then, like other major World Class stars, left WCCW to join the UWF.\n\nWhile in the Universal Wrestling Federation they would co-promote shows with the NWA. While wrestling in the NWA for Jim Crockett Promotions, he received a sizable push in the midcard, winning the NWA National Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. He also wrestled in the tournament for the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. Harris lost in the final match to Barry Windham.\n\nIn 1987 Black Bart wrestled in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling and had some matches with Antonio Inoki.\n\nHe then went back to Championship Wrestling from Florida and teamed with Bobby Jaggers and Tony Anthony while feuding with Dustin Rhodes and Mike Graham and The Nasty Boys.\n\nHe then went to the Continental Wrestling Association where he feuded with Dutch Mantel.\n\nIn May 1989 Bart went to Memphis and feuded with Jerry Lawler & Jeff Jarrett\n\nOn January 22, 1990 Black Bart made his debut for the World Wrestling Federation when he defeated Lee Peak in a dark match at a \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" taping in Miami, Florida. Four weeks later Bart made his first appearance on television, when he was defeated by Tito Santana on \"Prime Time Wrestling\" on February 19. For the remainder of the year he worked mostly as enhancement talent. Bart appeared in well over one hundred matches and being featured regularly on television. He did however, score victories over enhancement talent such as Jim Powers (a five match winning streak in July), Paul Diamond, Mark Young, Jim Evans, and Pez Whatley, and even managed to get a shot at the WWF World Tag Team Titles and wrestle the then-champions, Demolition alongside Bart's partner for the match, Mark Ming in a losing effort for Bart and Ming.\n\nBart was the opponent for several wrestlers making their debuts for the WWF. On April 24, 1990 Bart was defeated by Dustin Rhodes at a dark match at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping in San Antonio, Texas. This was the debut for Dustin. On the July 21 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Bart teamed with Tom Stone to face The Legion of Doom in their first match with the company. On July 24, 1990 he defeated Shane Douglas at a house show in Los Angeles, California. Following a series of matches in July against Jim Powers where he emerged victorious in every encounter he entered a house show series in August with Pez Whatley. Again he was unbeaten, and then moved on a to another house show program – this time with the former Killer Bee Jim Brunzell. Brunzell would win all of these encounters. In October he would enter a house show series with Dustin Rhodes and again would come up winless. That winter he began a series of matches with Saba Simba and Shane Douglas.\n\nOn the January 19, 1991 edition of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Bart went after the Tag-Team Championship again when he teamed with WT Jones in an unsuccessful challenge to The Hart Foundation. This would be his final WWF match, as he returned to WCW shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter leaving WWF he wrestled for the USWA owned World Class Championship Wrestling promotion in Texas where he struck up another feud with Sam Houston.\n\nLess than a month after his final televised WWF appearance, Black Bart signed with World Championship Wrestling. He made his first appearance at house show in Jacksonville, FL on February 15, 1991. Teaming with Dan Spivey and Buddy Landell, the trio mounted an unsuccessful challenge to WCW Six-Man Tag-Team Champions Junkyard Dog, Ricky Morton, and Tommy Rich. That spring he renewed several rivalries, as he faced Sam Houston and Dustin Rhodes on the house show circuit.\n\nWCW created a stable known as \"the Desperados\" consisting of Dutch Mantell, Black Bart, and Deadeye Dick. The Desperados were packaged with the gimmick of being three bumbling cowboys looking to meet up with Stan Hansen to go to WCW and become a team. Over the course of a few months, they were promoted through a series of vignettes by which they would be beaten up in saloons, searching ghost towns, and riding horses. The Desperadoes entered the ring for the first time at house show in Charlotte, NC on May 12, 1991, where they (Bart and Dutch Mantell) were defeated by The Young Pistols.\n\nBart made his first WCW PPV appearance seven days later at SuperBrawl I, when he substituted for Larry Zybysko in a match against Big Josh. Later that month Bart began teaming regularly with Deadeye Dick in house show matches against Ricky Morton and Dustin Rhodes. The full Desperadoes trio entered the ring for the first time on July 3, 1991 in East Rutherford, NJ at the start of the 1991 The Great American Bash tour, where they were defeated by The Freebirds and Badstreet Brad Armstrong. On July 14 he wrestled Junkyard Dog in the dark match of the Great American Bash PPV. He later appeared as a lumberjack in a match between Big Josh and Black Blood.\n\nWhile the Desperadoes angle continued and the trio was shown as late as the June 29th WCW Power Hour program still looking for Stan Hansen, the former AWA champion reportedly wanted no part of the storyline and left for Japan, never to return to wrestle in North America. Without Hansen, the group were pushed into service as jobbers and were dissolved as a stable before the end of the year. Bart's final match was on August 24, 1991 on the WCW Power Hour, when he teamed with Richard Myers against The WCW Patriots.\n\nTwo months after departing from WCW, Bart re-emerged in Global Wrestling Federation. Teaming with Tug Taylor he faced Chris Walker and Steve Simpson. During his tenure he won the Bass Knuckles title, as well as the Tag Team Titles 3 times, including once with John Hawk.\n\nHarris returned to WCW on November 26, 1995 when he participated in the 60 man, three ring battle royal at World War 3. Wrestling as \"Big Train Bart\", he was eliminated. He next appeared on WCW Saturday Night on November 30, where he faced Disco Inferno.\n\nHarris wrestled in the independents for the rest of his career before retiring in 2002. Harris resurfaced in 2006 wrestling on some independent shows in Texas. Harris has also appeared at many NWA reunion events.\n\nAs a trainer, his most famous pupil to date has been John Bradshaw Layfield. Harris once ran a professional wrestling school at the Dallas Sportatorium.\n\nA diabetic, Harris had heart bypass surgery in 2015.\n\nIn July 2016, Harris was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the case in September 2018.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Rick was inducted into the CWF Hall of Fame in Texas, alongside “The New Breed” Iron Mike and Johnny Blade.\n"}

In his \"Bride of Lammermoor\", Sir Walter Scott speaks of \"Peter Puncheon that was cooper to the queen's stores at the Timmer Burse (that is, Timber Bush) at Leith.\" The majority of bonded warehouses and stores on Timber Bush were burned down on a single night in 1982. The four remaining warehouses on the south side were not all bonds. Reading from left to right they held in turn; leather goods; peanuts and raisins; claret (only latterly being used for whisky); and lastly slates. These stand on the vaulted basement of an earlier huge warehouse (demolished 1830) which may have been the Queen's Stores referred to by Scott. All of the warehouses are now converted to other uses.\nThe central pair of warehouses appear as a single designed frontage, but other than the frontage are of completely different forms (quickly seen from the other side or in an aerial view). The odd 300mm gap between the westmost unit and the next building is explained by the need to maintain daylight to the inner building (bonds could not have open flames for lighting so before electricity had to be fully daylit). The windows line up between the two buildings and residents from one can reach into the other if the windows are open.\n\nTimber Bush is now an enclave behind the busy traffic of Bernard Street, and home to modern flats, marketing firms and small media companies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1901140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901140", "title": "The Great Sermon Handicap", "text": "The Great Sermon Handicap\n\n\"The Great Sermon Handicap\" is a short story by P. G. Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in \"The Strand Magazine\" in London in June 1922, and then in \"Cosmopolitan\" in New York that same month. The story was also included in the collection \"The Inimitable Jeeves\" as two separate stories.\n\nIn the story, Bertie and others make bets on an event called the Great Sermon Handicap. This story's plot continues into that of \"The Purity of the Turf\", though the two may be read as independent stories.\n\nBertie receives a letter from his cousin Eustace, who is with his twin Claude and Bertie's friend Bingo Little at Twing Hall. Eustace invites Bertie, claiming there is an opportunity to make money. The letter includes a baffling list of ministers, times, and prices. Bertie goes to Twing, where he talks to a friend, Lady Cynthia. Bertie later sees Bingo, who confesses to being in love with Cynthia.\n\nThe next morning, Bingo enters Bertie's bedroom to share his poetry about Cynthia. Claude and Eustace follow. Eustace says that an acquaintance, Steggles, came up with a fun variation on the standard horse race: the Sermon Handicap. Each local parson's Sunday sermon will be timed, and the parson who preaches the longest wins. Steggles made the list of parsons, their handicaps, and their current odds being taken for bets. One parson, Heppenstall, gives long sermons, but has a moderate handicap since Steggles underestimated him; Bertie funds bets on Heppenstall for a syndicate made of himself, Bingo, Claude, and Eustace. Eustace invites Jeeves to join them but Jeeves declines.\n\nLater, Claude and Eustace alert Bertie that another parson, G. Hayward, also gives long sermons. To protect their bets, Bertie asks Heppenstall to preach his long sermon on Brotherly Love. However, Heppenstall falls ill; his succinct nephew Bates will take his place. Bertie's syndicate placed ante-post (pre-event) bets; consequently, they will lose their wagers when Heppenstall fails to appear at the event. They bet on G. Hayward to make up for their anticipated losses.\n\nOn Sunday, G. Hayward gives a long sermon. Bertie and Bingo return to the Hall, where Bingo chastises Jeeves, who placed an S.P. (starting price, i.e. price at start of event) bet on Bates. Jeeves gives Bertie a letter, delivered earlier by Heppenstall's butler Brookfield, informing that Bates will give the full sermon on Brotherly Love. Jeeves had heard this from Brookfield. Jeeves adds, to Bingo's dismay, that Bates is engaged to Lady Cynthia.\n\nThe story was reprinted separately as its own book, published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1933. The dust wrapper shows Bertie saying to Jeeves, \"Jeeves old son, do you want a sporting flutter?\"; however, it was Eustace who said this to Jeeves in the story. \n\nThis story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in the \"Strand\", and by T. D. Skidmore in \"Cosmopolitan\". \n\nThe 1932 collection \"Nothing But Wodehouse\" and the 1960 collection \"The Most of P. G. Wodehouse\" included this story. \"The Great Sermon Handicap\" was featured in the 1983 collection of Wodehouse stories titled \"P. G. Wodehouse Short Stories\" published by The Folio Society and illustrated by George Adamson, and in the 1984 collection of clergy-related Wodehouse stories \"The World of Wodehouse Clergy\" published by Hutchinson.\n\nIn 1940, the story was included in the anthology \"Laughter Parade\", published by Faber & Faber. It was featured in the 1966 anthology \"Best Stories of Church and Clergy\", published by Faber. The story was also collected in the 1979 anthology \"The Gambler's Companion\" with cartoons by Enzo Apicella, published by Paddington.\n\nThe story was translated into 57 languages published in a 6-volume set by J.H. Heineman, New York, in 1989. Each volume contains the English original and a phonetic transcription of it, with the following other languages and scripts:\n\nIn 1930, some Cambridge undergraduate students founded \"The Wooster Society\" and repeated the Great Sermon Handicap. The field included the bishops of Ely and Singapore, Monsignor Ronald Knox, and a missionary, the Rev. H. C. Read, who won preaching at the parish church of St Andrew the Great.\n\nThe story was adapted for the third episode of the first series of \"The World of Wooster\". The episode, titled \"Jeeves and the Great Sermon Handicap\", originally aired on 13 June 1965.\n\nThis story was not adapted for an episode by the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" television series.\n\nThis story, along with the rest of \"The Inimitable Jeeves\", was adapted into a radio drama in 1973 as part of the series \"What Ho! Jeeves\" starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.\n\n\n\n"}

It derives from the Georgian word \"mc'k'rivi\" (მწკრივი), which means \"row\". Formally, it refers to a set of six verb forms inflected for person and number forming a single paradigm. For example, the aorist screeve for most verbal forms consists at least of a preverb (და \"da\"-), a root (წერ \"c'er\", \"write\"), and a screeve ending (ე \"-e\", ა \"-a\", ეს \"-es\"), and in the first and second persons a plural suffix (თ \"-t\") to form the inflection (დაწერეთ \"dac'eret\"):\n\nGiven the presence of similar terms in Western grammars, it is important to understand how screeves differ from them. In many Western languages, endings encode all of tense, aspect and mood, but in Georgian, the screeve endings may or may not include one of these categories. For example, the perfect series screeves have modal and evidential properties that are completely absent in the aorist and present/future series screeves, such that წერილი დაუწერია \"c'erili dauc'eria\" \"He has apparently written the letter\" implies that the speaker knows the letter is written because they have seen the letter written on a table. However, the present form წერილს დაწერს \"c'erils dac'ers\" \"He will write the letter\" is simply neutral with respect to the question of how the speaker knows (or does not know) that the letter will be written.\n\n"}

I actually respect folks who stand up for their beliefs – even if I disagree with them—than the folks who do not care, are afraid to 'get involved', or who cannot be bothered. I admire passion and commitment. A woman once told me she could not watch those slaughterhouse videos because she 'loves animals so much' and it would upset her.

They based their decision on their analysis that Philippine electoral processes were so corrupt that participation in elections tended to corrupt the contestants themselves and the results often did not reflect the true will of the people.\n\nIn 2004, Philippine Greens secretary-general Roberto Verzol published an analysis which showed how widespread fraud in election tabulation could have altered the results of the presidential elections. Verzola also pointed out the errors of the National Movement for Free Elections's (NAMFREL) independent tally in the May 10, 2004 elections in his 12-page study.\n\nSome of Philippine Green members subsequently initiated the formation of an independent election monitoring group, \"Halalang Marangal\" (Network of Citizens for Honest Elections and Truthful Statistics), to work for clean and honest elections.\n\nToday, the Philippine Greens continue to focus on environmental issues and concerns. Their members are spread out within other environmental groups in the Philippines and they conduct regular fellowship meetings to share experiences, discuss the current situation, formulate a common stand, and make plans for intensifying and expanding their environmental advocacies.\n\nIn 2007, Reido Panaligan, coordinator of the Ecowaste Coalition of the Philippines, was selected by consensus to become the group's secretary-general.\n"}

That is, the relative probability assigned to a volume of a probability space using a Jeffreys prior will be the same regardless of the parameterization used to define the Jeffreys prior. This makes it of special interest for use with \"scale parameters\".\n\nFor an alternative parameterization formula_3 we can derive\n\nfrom\n\nusing the change of variables theorem for transformations and the definition of Fisher information:\n\nFor an alternative parameterization formula_7 we can derive\n\nfrom\n\nusing the change of variables theorem for transformations, the definition of Fisher information, and that the product of determinants is the determinant of the matrix product:\n\nFrom a practical and mathematical standpoint, a valid reason to use this non-informative prior instead of others, like the ones obtained through a limit in conjugate families of distributions, is that the relative probability of a volume of the probability space is not dependent upon the set of parameter variables that is chosen to describe parameter space.\n\nSometimes the Jeffreys prior cannot be normalized, and is thus an improper prior. For example, the Jeffreys prior for the distribution mean is uniform over the entire real line in the case of a Gaussian distribution of known variance.\n\nUse of the Jeffreys prior violates the strong version of the likelihood principle, which is accepted by many, but by no means all, statisticians. When using the Jeffreys prior, inferences about formula_2 depend not just on the probability of the observed data as a function of formula_2, but also on the universe of all possible experimental outcomes, as determined by the experimental design, because the Fisher information is computed from an expectation over the chosen universe. Accordingly, the Jeffreys prior, and hence the inferences made using it, may be different for two experiments involving the same formula_2 parameter even when the likelihood functions for the two experiments are the same—a violation of the strong likelihood principle.\n\nIn the minimum description length approach to statistics the goal is to describe data as compactly as possible where the length of a description is measured in bits of the code used. For a parametric family of distributions one compares a code with the best code based on one of the distributions in the parameterized family. The main result is that in exponential families, asymptotically for large sample size, the code based on the distribution that is a mixture of the elements in the exponential family with the Jeffreys prior is optimal. This result holds if one restricts the parameter set to a compact subset in the interior of the full parameter space. If the full parameter is used a modified version of the result should be used.\n\nThe Jeffreys prior for a parameter (or a set of parameters) depends upon the statistical model.\n\nFor the Gaussian distribution of the real value formula_14\nwith formula_16 fixed, the Jeffreys prior for the mean formula_17 is\nThat is, the Jeffreys prior for formula_17 does not depend upon formula_17; it is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the real line — the distribution that is 1 (or some other fixed constant) for all points. This is an improper prior, and is, up to the choice of constant, the unique \"translation\"-invariant distribution on the reals (the Haar measure with respect to addition of reals), corresponding to the mean being a measure of \"location\" and translation-invariance corresponding to no information about location.\n\nFor the Gaussian distribution of the real value formula_14\nwith formula_17 fixed, the Jeffreys prior for the standard deviation formula_24 is\nEquivalently, the Jeffreys prior for formula_26 is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the real line, and thus this distribution is also known as the . Similarly, the Jeffreys prior for formula_27 is also uniform. It is the unique (up to a multiple) prior (on the positive reals) that is \"scale\"-invariant (the Haar measure with respect to multiplication of positive reals), corresponding to the standard deviation being a measure of \"scale\" and scale-invariance corresponding to no information about scale. As with the uniform distribution on the reals, it is an improper prior.\n\nFor the Poisson distribution of the non-negative integer formula_28,\nthe Jeffreys prior for the rate parameter formula_30 is\nEquivalently, the Jeffreys prior for formula_32 is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the non-negative real line.\n\nFor a coin that is \"heads\" with probability formula_33 and is \"tails\" with probability formula_34, for a given formula_35 the probability is formula_36. The Jeffreys prior for the parameter formula_37 is\n\nThis is the arcsine distribution and is a beta distribution with formula_39. Furthermore, if formula_40 the Jeffreys prior for formula_41 is uniform in the interval formula_42. Equivalently, formula_41 is uniform on the whole circle formula_44.\n\nSimilarly, for a throw of an formula_45-sided die with outcome probabilities formula_46, each non-negative and satisfying formula_47, the Jeffreys prior for formula_48 is the Dirichlet distribution with all (alpha) parameters set to one half. This amounts to using a pseudocount of one half for each possible outcome.\n\nEquivalently, if we write formula_49 for each formula_50, then the Jeffreys prior for formula_51 is uniform on the (\"N\" − 1)-dimensional unit sphere (\"i.e.\", it is uniform on the surface of an \"N\"-dimensional unit ball).\n"}
{"id": "1901162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901162", "title": "CIDNP", "text": "CIDNP\n\nDiscovered in 1967 by Bargon et al.; Ward and Lowler, CIDNP (chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization), often pronounced like \"kidnip\", is an nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique that is used to study chemical reactions that involve radicals. It is related to chemically induced dynamic electron polarization (CIDEP) insofar as the radical-pair mechanism explains both phenomena.\n\nThe effect is detected by NMR spectroscopy, usually using H NMR spectrum, as enhanced absorption or emission signals (\"negative peaks\"). The effect arises when unpaired electrons (radicals) are generated during a chemical reaction. Because the magnetic moment of an electron is more than 600x that of a proton, the spins of many protons are polarized beyond the usual thermal Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe CIDNP experiment is conducted within the NMR tube. The radicals are produced by thermal or photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or disproportionation of radical pairs.\n\nThe generation of CIDNP in a typical photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and approximately half of the molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The kinetics are complicated and may involve multiple protonations and deprotonations, and hence exhibit pH dependence.\n\nThe radical pair may either cross over to a singlet electron state and then recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two pathways for a given radical pair depends on the nuclear spin state and leads to the nuclear spin state sorting and observable nuclear polarization.\n\nDetected as enhanced absorptive or emissive signals in the NMR spectra of the reaction products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this photo-CIDNP technique, as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains.\n\nAlthough usually observed in liquids, the photo-CIDNP effect has also been detected in solid state, for example on C and N nuclei in photosynthetic reaction centres, where significant nuclear polarization can accumulate as a result of spin selection processes in the electron transfer reactions.\n\nCIDNP was discovered in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found that in many cases DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied on the ability of nuclear spin interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the radical pair mechanism is currently accepted as the most common cause of CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.\n\n\n"}

Built on the River Feorish at the foot of Arigna Mountain, it lies between Loughs Skean and Meelagh with Lough Arrow, Lough Allen, Lough Bo and Lough-na-Sool nearby. It lies on the Sligo/Leitrim R284 regional road on the border with County Sligo.\n\nThe first church at Kilronan, Keadue, County Roscommon, was built in the 8th century by St. Ronan and his daughter St. Lasair. It was replaced in 1339 by one built by Fergal O'Duigenan which was burned down in 1340 and replaced three years later by the church, one gable of which stands today. Sheltered by that gable is the vault of the McDermott Roes, in which Turlough O'Carolan was interred in 1738.\n\nThis gable is a memorial to the Gaelic Literary tradition from the 13th -18th century as represented by the O'Duigenans, hereditary erenachs of Kilronan (lay abbots who held church land from generation to generation), and chroniclers (as well as bards and ollavs-hereditary poets) to the MacDermots, Princes of Moylurg, down to Turlough O'Carolan, sometimes styled \"The Last of the Bards\". The O'Duigenans maintained a school of history on this site.\n\nKilronan Castle, which was also known as Castle Tenison, is a 19th-century castle dating from two different periods. The earlier part was built by Thomas Tenison, consisting of a 3-storey-over-basement, 3-bay symmetrical castellated block with slender corner turrets, pinnacled buttresses and tracery windows. This was built in about 1820, and may incorporate a Palladian style Georgian house. The later part is two storeys high, is irregular, and of rubble stone with a baronial tower.\n\nThe castle was inherited by Florence (née Tenison) wife of the Henry King-Tenison, 8th Earl of Kingston whose husband assumed the additional name of Tenison. The Tenisons were early photographers. In particular Edward King-Tenison travelled in Spain in the 1850s, where he took pictures of its castles and scenery. E.K. Tenison took photographs of Kilronan Castle in 1859 which were printed with albumen.\nIn 1814 the castle was occupied by Thomas Tenison. The castle is a now a hotel.\n\nA memorial to a local musician and songwriter, Josie McDermott, lies in the village centre, and a memorial garden on the Feorish bank is dedicated to all who attended fair days in the village for centuries, and who worked in Arigna Coal Mines overlooking the village.\n\nKilronan Castle Hotel can be seen on walks to Lough Meelagh, the former home of the Earl of Kingston, and Alderford House, the last home of Turlough O'Carolan, is adjacent to the village. Turlough O'Carolan is buried in nearby Kilronan Abbey.\n\nThere is also a primary school, church, and GAA grounds in the area. There are two pubs in the village, although one is not open full-time. There is a garage/petrol-station a shop and hardware store.\n\nSt. Lasair's well is a spring feed well outside the village.\n\n"}

{"id": "1901196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901196", "title": "Manantali Dam", "text": "Manantali Dam\n\nThe Manantali Dam is a multi-purpose dam on the Bafing river in the Senegal River basin, to the south-east of Bafoulabé, in Mali's Kayes Region.\n\nEarly planning for the dam began in 1972 when the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River (Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal, or OMVS) was set up by Mali, Mauritania and Senegal to develop the agricultural and hydropower potential of the basin. The World Bank declined to fund the dam in 1979, considering it an unreasonable investment. However, financing was secured mainly from Europe and construction on the dam began in 1982. It was completed in 1988, but without the hydropower plant. In 1989 the Mauritania–Senegal Border War stopped all work on the project. A Swiss journalist who visited Manantali in 1988 described the project as a \"luxury car without a motor\". In 1993 Carl–Dieter Spranger, then Germany's minister for development assistance, called Manantali an \"act of economic and environmental nonsense\". When the conflict subsided in 1991 the OMVS sought a new loan package for the hydropower plant, which was finally put together in 1997. The dam began to produce electricity for Senegal, Mali and Mauritania in 2001.\n\nToday the dam is managed by the tripartite Manantali Energy Management Company, the \"Société de gestion de l’énergie de Manantali\" (SOGEM) created in 1997. SOGEM in turn has signed a 15-year concession contract with the private company EEM, a subsidiary of the South African national power company ESKOM, to operate the plant. OMVS is represented on the board of SOGEM. Citing \"contractual difficulties in executing the contract\", Eskom has entered into an agreement with SOGEM to terminate it as of 1 October 2011, according to the company's 2011 financial report.\n\nThe total cost of the dam, its associated hydropower plant, the deforestation of the future reservoir, studies and \"complementary measures\" was 1.02bn Euro. The construction cost of the related Diama Dam further downstream was an additional 50m Euro.\nThe dam was jointly financed by 16 donors, including German (14%) and French (13%) development cooperation, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Nations Development Program. The three benefiting African countries also contributed to the financing. 64% of the foreign financing was through soft loans and 36% through grants. The European Community, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank, and the Nordic Development Fund also contributed to the financing. The government of Norway had declined to finance the dam because of concerns about its health impact.\n\nThe expected benefits included electricity generation, increased agricultural production through irrigation and improved river navigability.\n\nElectricity generation. A 2008 evaluation of the dam conducted by three financiers (EIB, German KfW and French AFD) concluded that the main benefit of the dam is the generation of hydro-power, where the production of 740 GWh per year exceeded expectations of 540 GWh. About 55% of the electricity is used in Mali, 30% in Senegal and 15% in Mauritania. In 2006 in Mali more than 90% of all electricity generated came from Manantali, in Mauritania 34% and in Senegal 13%. The dam has not resolved the power problem of the three countries, where power outages regularly occur and the few existing industries have to produce their own power. As for the economic efficiency of the project, the European evaluation calculated an economic rate of return of the hydro-power component of 8%. A World Bank evaluation even calculated an economic rate of return of 12 to 24%. The plant load factor of the planned hydro-power plant - the expected electricity production divided by the potential production if the power plant was utilized permanently at full capacity, is 42% compared to 45-60% for other hydro-power plants. However, these economic benefits did not translate into financial benefits for two reasons: First, bulk electricity tariffs were set at only about half of production costs (4.7 Euro Cents/kWh compared to 8.8 Cents). Second, the national power utilities of the three countries that buy the electricity in bulk regularly pay only about half their bills. The entity in charge of operating the hydro-power plant, SOGEM, thus accumulates deficits. A Hydrology Risk Fund was to be gradually replenished in order to pay for operating costs of the plant in the case of a revenue shortfall due to drought. The Fund received only limited contributions, since the payments earmarked for the fund were instead used for rural electrification in areas near the power transmission lines in response to pressure from local communities.\n\nThe agricultural benefits achieved through the dam were \"below reasonable expectations\". The dam irrigates an additional 78,100 hectares (781 square kilometres) of land in Senegal (54,700 hectares), Mauritania (20,400 ha) and Mali (3,000 ha), which actually exceeds expectations. However, yields remain low and only a single crop is harvested each year, partly because in all three countries producer prices for rice are set by the governments below the world market price, thus providing little incentive for farmers to increase production to its full potential. The stated project goal to increase food self-sufficiency has not been achieved: The share of rice self-sufficiency decreased in Senegal from 23% in 1980 to 20% in 2006 and rice production has stagnated since 1990. The share of cereal self-sufficiency in Mauritania decreased from 80% to 30%.\n\nThe objective of increasing the navigability of the Senegal River between Saint-Louis, Senegal and Ambidédi, Mali had already been abandoned in 1980 prior to its construction because it proved unfeasible.\n\nThe dam has proved controversial for its displacement of 10,000 people from the flooded area, and for its environmental and health-related impacts. In the irrigated areas the incidence of water-borne diseases such as bilharzia increased substantially, while local fisheries declined sharply. The annual flood of the Senegal river had been the basis of flood recession agriculture, fishing, and cattle grazing. With the Manantali dam, the annual flood has been reduced to an artificial two–week flood. Traditionally, the Senegal river inundated about 150,000 hectares on average, and up to 350,000 hectares in high–flow years. In 1999,this was expected to be reduced to between 30,000 and 50,000 hectares in an average year, and much less in a dry year. It has been estimated that about 370,000 people had lived from flood recession agriculture in the Senegal river valley before the dam was built. Flood recession agriculture has now completely disappeared. Only a small share of the farmers affected was compensated with land irrigated from the Manantali reservoir.\n\n"}
{"id": "1901215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901215", "title": "Senate of South Africa", "text": "Senate of South Africa\n\nThe Senate was the upper house of the Parliament of South Africa between 1910 and its abolition from 1 January 1981, and between 1994 and 1997.\n\nUnder white minority rule in the Union of South Africa, most of the Senators were chosen by an electoral college consisting of Members of each of the four Provincial Councils and Members of the House of Assembly (the lower house of Parliament, directly elected). The remaining Senators were appointed by the Governor-General of the Union on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Senate's presiding officer was called the President, whereas his counterpart in the House of Assembly was the Speaker.\n\nThe South Africa Act 1909, which created the Senate, included special provisions for the selection of the first elected Senators. The Union Parliament was prohibited from changing the arrangements for the Senate during its first ten years.\n\nThe First Senate included eight Senators from each province. They were elected for a ten-year term, by the members serving during the final session of the legislatures of each of the four colonies which joined the Union of South Africa. The election was by a form of the single transferable vote. The remaining eight seats were filled, by appointment (also for ten-year terms) by the Governor-General-in-Council (in effect by General Louis Botha's first Union government). Section 24 of the South Africa Act 1909 provided that, of the nominated Senators,\n\nCasual vacancies in the representation of the provinces, in the First Senate only, were filled by an electoral college composed of the members of the relevant Provincial Council. New Senators, elected in this way, held the seat for the residue of the ten-year term. Nominated Senators, appointed to fill vacancies, received a ten-year term and did not have to vacate their seats at the end of the term for the provincial representatives. \n\nThe composition, by party, of the provincial representatives in the First Senate included 18 representatives of the three colonial governing parties (six each from the South African Party of the Cape, Orangia Unie of the Orange River Colony and Het Volk of the Transvaal), eight Independent Senators from Natal (which did not have a party system before the Union), and six Senators from the opposition parties (two each from the Unionist Party of the Cape, the Constitutional Party of Orange River Colony and the Progressive Party of Transvaal).\n\nThe eight Senators, elected for each province under the ordinary provisions for senate elections in the South Africa Act 1909, were returned by an electoral college composed of the members from the province in the House of Assembly and the Provincial Council. In 1920 the Senate term was for ten years and there was no provision for an earlier dissolution of the Senate.\n\nThe provisions for nominated Senators were unchanged from those in the First Senate.\n\nThe Second Senate had a small majority for the South African Party (SAP). When the National Party (NP)-led Pact government took office in 1924, its supporters were therefore in a minority in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate Act 1926 modified the original constitutional provisions for the Senate. A new power was conferred so that the Governor-General-in-Council could dissolve the whole Senate (vacating both elected and nominated seats), either at the time of a general election for the House of Assembly or within 120 days of the election. Another provision required the nominated Senators to vacate their seats whenever there was a change of government.\n\nAfter the South African general election, 1929 the Senate dissolution power was used for the first time, on 16 August 1929.\n\nThe Third Senate had a small NP majority, in 1929. After the NP and the SAP formed a coalition in 1933 and fused to form the United Party (UP) in 1934, the government had a large Senate majority.\n\nThe UP government passed the Representation of Natives Act 1936. This legislation affected the Senate by adding another four Senators to represent the black population of South Africa. The Native Representative Senators were white people, who held office for a fixed term and were not affected by a dissolution of the Senate. The new seats were filled by indirect election, the black electors being officeholders such as tribal chiefs and the members of local government bodies.\n\nJust before the expiry of the ten-year Senate term, the UP split over the issue of South Africa's participation in the Second World War. The followers of the former Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog entered the 1939 Senate election as a separate party, having left the United Party but not yet arranged a merger with the opposition Purified National Party.\n\nThe provincial Electoral Colleges met on 17 November 1939. After the election and the filling of the nominated seats, the Senate was left with a pro-war majority. There were 24 pro-government Senators (20 UP including 7 nominated members, 2 Dominion Party and 2 Labour Party) and 16 opposition Senators (10 supporters of General Hertzog including one nominated member, and 6 Purified National Party). The four Native Representative Senators were also pro-war.\n\nAfter the South African general election, 1948 a Reunited National Party-Afrikaner Party coalition came to power, with minority support in the Senate. The new government used the dissolution power, to trigger a new Senate election. The Senate was dissolved, on 9 July 1948.\n\nThe eight nominated Senators were appointed on 28 July 1948 and the Electoral Colleges met in the provincial capitals the following day. At the end of this process the government had 22 supporters (Reunited National Party 11, Afrikaner Party 2, Independent 1 and the 8 nominated Senators) and the opposition 21 (United Party 15, Labour Party 3, and Native Representatives 3). The fourth Native Representative seat was vacant.\n\nThe South West Africa Affairs Amendment Act 1949, added four additional members to the Senate, of whom two were to be elected, and two nominated by the Governor-General. The elected Senators were chosen by an Electoral College, composed of the members of South-West Africa's Legislative Assembly and the six members of the House of Assembly representing the territory.\n\nOf the nominated Senators, one was to be selected mainly on the ground of his \"thorough acquaintance, by reason of his official experience or otherwise, with the reasonable wants and wishes or the coloured races of the territory\". All four Senators chosen on 29 September 1950 were NP supporters.\n\nIn 1955, Nationalist Prime Minister Johannes Strijdom wanted to amend one of the entrenched clauses in the Constitution, to separate Coloured voters from whites, but his party did not have the constitutionally required two-thirds majority in a joint session of both houses of Parliament. It was decided to alter the composition and electoral system for the Senate, to enable the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951 to be validated. Consequently, Strijdom had the Senate Act 1955 passed to amend the constitution.\n\nInstead of each province electing eight Senators, by proportional representation, the new system required provincial representatives to be selected by a first past the post election in the Electoral College. The effect of this was to enable the majority group from each province (NP in all the provinces, except for Natal) to secure all the seats available. In addition Cape Province and Transvaal had their representation increased to 22 and 27 seats respectively. The number of nominated Senators from the Union of South Africa was doubled from eight to sixteen. The representation of South-West Africa and black voters was unchanged.\n\nAnother change made in 1955 was to reduce Senatorial terms from ten years to five. The size of the Senate rose from 44 to 89 (increased to 90 in 1956 when a nominated Senator was added to represent the coloured population for a fixed term until 1962).\n\nAt the end of the last term of the Native Representative Senators, in 1960, those seats were abolished. The Senate Act 1960 reduced the size of the Senate and reinstated proportional representation elections. However instead of going back to eight Senators per province, the Cape would have 11, Transvaal 14 (15 from 1970) and the two smaller provinces would retain 8 Senators. Again, the representation from South-West Africa was unchanged. The number of nominated Senators from the Union, went back to eight and the requirement for half of them to be acquainted with the 'reasonable wants and wishes' of non-white South Africans was abolished.\n\nThe Senate was reduced in size to 54 in 1960 and 53 in 1962 (as the representative of the coloured community retained his seat until 1962).\n\nThe Senate composition remained unchanged by the declaration of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, except that the State President took over the role of the Governor-General in appointing Senators. Under the republican Constitution, the President of the Senate was to act as State President whenever that office was vacant, or if a state president was unable to perform his duties.\n\nSection 28 (1) (a) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 1961, provided that there should be \"eight senators nominated by the State President of whom two shall be nominated from each province ...\". The South Africa Act 1909 had not limited the number of nominated senators to be from any particular province.\n\nSouth-West Africa's representation in the South African Parliament was abolished in 1977, to pave the way for independence for the territory.\n\nIn 1980, Prime Minister P.W Botha began a process of constitutional reform, with the establishment of the President's Council, a 60-seat advisory body with provision for ten Coloureds, five Indians, and one Chinese, but no black members. As a consequence, the Senate was deemed to be redundant and would be dissolved. It was abolished under the terms of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Fifth Amendment Act with effect from 1 January 1981, which established the President's Council from the same date.\n\nIn 1984, the former Senate chamber was converted for use as the House of Representatives, reserved for Coloureds under the tricameral system.

It was the first papal bull issued with a crusade as its subject.\n\nThe bull was issued in response to the fall of Edessa, in December 1144. Pilgrims from the east had brought news of the fall of Edessa to Europe throughout 1145, and embassies from the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Armenia soon arrived directly at the papal court at Viterbo. Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, one of the dioceses of Jerusalem, was among those who delivered the news. \n\nAs with most papal bulls, it had no specific title, and has come to be known by its opening words; in Latin the first sentence read \"\"Quantum praedecessores nostri Romani pontifices pro liberatione Orientalis Ecclesiae laboraverunt, antiquorum relatione didicimus, et in gestis eorum scriptum reperimus\"\" – in English, \"How much our predecessors the Roman pontiffs did labour for the deliverance of the oriental church, we have learned from the accounts of the ancients and have found it written in their acts.\"\n\nThe bull, issued at Vetralla, briefly recounted the acts of the First Crusade, and lamented the loss of Edessa, Mesopotamia, one of the oldest Christian cities. The bull was addressed directly to Louis VII of France and his subjects, and promised the remission of sins for all those who took the cross, as well as ecclesiastical protection for their families and possessions, just as Pope Urban II had done before the First Crusade. Those who completed the crusade, or died along the way, were offered full absolution. \n\nLouis was already preparing a crusade of his own, independent of Eugenius' bull, and it appears that Louis may have at first ignored the bull completely. It is possible that the embassies from the east had visited Louis as well. However, in consultation with the preacher Bernard of Clairvaux, Louis eventually sought Eugenius' blessing, and Louis' crusade enjoyed full papal support. The bull was reissued on March 1, 1146, and Bernard began to preach the crusade throughout France and later in Germany as well, where he persuaded Conrad III to participate.\n\nAlthough this is the first papal bull calling for a crusade, the papacy was largely absent from the rest of the expedition. The First Crusade had no such bull – support was gathered at the Council of Clermont in 1095, and spread quickly through popular preaching. Urban II was seen as the leader of the crusade, through his legates, such as Adhemar of Le Puy. By the mid-12th century, papal power had dwindled somewhat, and Rome was controlled by the Commune of Rome. Although there were papal legates accompanying the crusade, the expedition was controlled by Louis and Conrad, not a religious leader. \n\nThe crusade was mostly destroyed during its march through Anatolia. Louis and Conrad later joined with the army of Jerusalem at the unsuccessful Siege of Damascus in 1148. \n\n\n"}

He was UTC's first African-American wrestler. Whatley was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\n\nWhatley started wrestling in 1973 after a brief career as a power lifter. He wrestled with the (original) Sheik's Big Time Wrestling, after which he wrestled primarily in Alabama and Tennessee before going to Florida Championship Wrestling in 1984. He won the Southern Title twice while there. He was one-third of the \"Convertible Blondes\" with Rip Rogers and Gary Royal in the Angelo Poffo-promoted ICW, even though he didn't dye his hair blonde. One of Whatley's best-known moments in ICW was the \"Mop Head\" angle where Whatley had to wear a mop wig after losing a match to Ron Garvin. The match stipulation also required him to keep wearing it until he won another match. This led to not only a lengthy feud with Garvin but also to a long losing streak for Whatley. Most of Whatley's losses were by disqualification due to outside interference when Garvin would attack Whatley's opponent. The angle lasted for several months until Whatley finally won a match.\n\nHe went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985 and often teamed with Jimmy Valiant against members of Paul Jones' Army. In 1986, after Valiant called Whatley \"the best \"black\" athlete in professional wrestling\", Whatley turned on Valiant and cut some of Valiant's hair, thinking Valiant's comment was racist. Whatley then became a \"Heel\", joined Jones' Army and renamed himself \"Shaska Whatley\". He frequently teamed with The Barbarian and Baron von Raschke in their war against Valiant, and would frequently spit on his opponents during matches. He eventually lost a hair vs. hair match to Valiant and was shaved bald. In 1986, during a short stint when Dusty Rhodes was NWA Champion, Watley appeared to freelance during a TV interview and made the announcers visibly uncomfortable when he said that he wanted to become the first \"black\" NWA Champion.\n\nIn late 1987, Whatley had left Jones and started teaming with Tiger Conway Jr. as \"The Jive Tones\". They did not have much success, and Whatley left for Florida in 1988. He was part of Kevin Sullivan's goon squad in Florida and departed for Alabama shortly after his arrival.\n\nIn Alabama's Southeast Championship Wrestling, Whatley became \"Willie B. Hert\" and was one of the top faces for the company.\n\nIn the early 1990s Pez Whatley had a short stint in Japan's UWFi. He also worked for the World Wrestling Federation as an enhancement talent on their weekly television programs from January 1990 until April 1991, putting over many of the WWF's top stars. He also picked up a few victories on house shows, most notably over Paul Diamond and The Genius. Whatley then made sporadic appearances in World Championship Wrestling throughout the 90s as an enhancement talent as well as appearances at the 1995 and 1996 World War 3 events until his in-ring retirement in 1998, becoming a backstage worker for WCW and an assistant trainer at the WCW Power Plant.\n\nWhile working for WCW in the late 1990s, Whatley was hospitalized for bronchitis, where doctors discovered he had an enlarged heart which would likely stop pumping sooner than normal. In the years waiting for a transplant (which he didn't get), he was prematurely pronounced dead twice. On January 15, 2005, he had a heart attack and died in hospital in Chattanooga on January 18.\n\n"}

It is located in the Region of Kayes at the confluence of the Bafing and Bakoy rivers which join to become the Sénégal River. Bafoulabé is the capital of the Cercle of Bafoulabé, which in 1887 was the first Cercle to be created in Mali.\n\nUntil the 1996 law creating communes, Bafoulabé Commune was an arrondissement. While now deprecated, the commune retains the same boundaries, extending far beyond the town of Bafoulabé, its seat (\"chef-lieu\"). Bafoulabé is also the seat of the larger Bafoulabé Cercle. Apart from the town, there are 28 villages, official rural subdivisions within the Commune. It is a \"Rural Commune\", meaning it is subdivided in villages, in contrast to the smaller \"Urban Commune\", divided into urban Quarters. Commune affairs are directed by an elected Commune Council (\"conseil communal\") of 23 members and a Commune executive (\"bureau communal\") of the elected Mayor and three adjutants. The executive is tasked with carrying out the directives voted by the Council. National policies are carried out by a Sub-Prefect (\"sous préfet\"), who also carries out certain of the Council's directives over the local arms or national bodies.\n\nAt Bafoulabé the Bafing and Bakoy rivers meet to form the Sénégal River. In Bambara, Bafoulabé means \"meeting of two rivers\".\nThe Manantali hydroelectric dam and its reservoir, Lake Manantali, the largest in Mali, is located 90 km to the south-east of Bafoulabé on the Bafing.\n\nExtending across two banks of the Senegal River, the Commune is bounded to the east by Kontéla Commune and Oualia Commune, to the north Tomora Commune and Sidibéla Commune, to the south by Mahina Commune and to the west by Diamou Commune of Kayes Cercle. The climate is Sahelian. The June to October rainy season accounts for all the less than 900 mm of precipitation a year. While hot year round by temperate standards, a hot season lasts from roughly February to June, and a cooler season runs from roughly November to February. Maximum yearly temperature may reach 41 °C in the shade.\n\nThe Sahel landscape of the Commune is made up of grasslands punctuated by trees, often large. These include the baobab, the rônier, raffia palm (from which textiles, rope, and palm oil is made), shea (from which Shea Butter is made), duguto, and néré trees.\n\nBafoulabé had a population of 16,670 in 1998 and 19,955 in 2009. Prior to colonialism, Bafoulabé had been a thriving commercial center. The construction of the Dakar Bamako railway in the early 20th century bypassed the river trade, making Kayes the center of commercial activity in the area. The town's population consists primarily of Khassonkés, Malinkés, Soninkés and Fulas. Fily Dabo Sissoko, writer and one of the founding fathers of independent Mali, was a native of Bafoulabé. The Festival dansa/diawoura, a festival of traditional dance, took place in Bafoulabé from April 8 to April 10, 2005.\n\nThe legend of Mali Sadio, which concerns a hippopotamus who develops a friendship with a young lady called Sadio, takes place in Bafoulabé.\n\n\n\n"}

The picture focuses on the competition between naval fixed-wing and airship pilots to reach the South Pole by air.\n\nThe female lead is played to Fay Wray. The action scenes feature the stars Jack Holt and Ralph Graves, who also played fliers two years earlier in Capra's 1929 airborne adventure \"Flight\". This film had been intended to emulate the success of \"Wings\" (1927), another production with a similar plot. \"Dirigible\" was characterized as \"marginally science fictional\" by scifilm.org. (Capra later planned to make a fully science fictional movie but was never able to.)\n\nWhen the famed explorer Louis Rondelle (Hobart Bosworth) requests the U.S. Navy's assistance in reaching the South Pole, officer Jack Bradon (Jack Holt) convinces Rear Admiral John S. Martin (Emmett Corrigan) to offer his dirigible, the USS \"Pensacola\", for the attempt. \n\nJack asks his best friend, \"Frisky\" Pierce (Ralph Graves), to pilot the biplane that will be carried on the airship. Frisky, who is adventurous to the point of recklessness, is eager to go even though he has just completed a record-setting coast-to-coast flight and has barely spent any time with his wife, Helen (Fay Wray). Basking in the acclaim, he has even forgotten to read the sealed love letter she gave him to open when he arrived.\n\nHelen loves Frisky but cannot make him believe how much she is hurt by the risks he takes. She sees Jack without her husband's knowledge and begs him to drop Frisky from the expedition, and for the sake of their marriage, not tell him why. Jack, who also loves her, agrees. Frisky, assuming Jack does not want to share the fame, ends their friendship.\nThe expedition soon ends in disaster: the \"Pensacola\" breaks in two and crashes into the ocean during a storm. Frisky participates in the rescue of the expedition by aircraft carrier. He now gets a leave of absence from the Navy to pilot a Fokker Trimotor transport aircraft for Rondelle's next attempt at the South Pole. This proves too much for Helen. When she is unable to get Frisky to change his mind, she gives him another sealed letter (to be read when he reaches the Pole), but this time it says that she is divorcing him and will ask Jack to marry her.\n\nFrisky, Rondelle, Sock McGuire (Roscoe Karns), and Hansen (Harold Goodwin) reach the South Pole. When Frisky suggests landing on the snow, Rondelle accepts his judgment that there will be no danger. But in fact the aircraft flips over and bursts into flames, destroying most of their supplies. Rondelle's leg is broken and Sock's foot is injured. \n\nAfter radioing their base camp, they attempt to walk the 900 miles back to it, dragging Rondelle on a sled. Rondelle soon dies and is buried. Later, Frisky has to amputate Sock's foot. When Sock realizes he is too much of a burden, he drags himself away to die while the other two are sleeping. They carry on, but Hansen breaks down when he finds they have been going in a circle and have returned to Rondelle's grave. Frisky refuses to give up and forces Hansen to continue on.\n\nWhen Helen hears the news of the crash, she realizes no longer wants a divorce and wishes she could go to Frisky. Jack realizes he can, and talks Rear Admiral Martin into letting him attempt a rescue with his new dirigible, the USS \"Los Angeles\". The two survivors are found and rescued. On the way back, Frisky remembers that he has again forgotten to read Helen's letter, but he has snow blindness and asks Jack to read it to him. Jack quickly substitutes his own improvised version, in which Helen is proud of his accomplishment and waiting for her husband with undiminished love. He then destroys the letter. When they return, Frisky uncharacteristically skips a ticker tape parade through New York City to be with his wife. He is the first to mention the contents of the letter; to Helen's great relief, she realizes that Jack has not only brought Frisky back to her but also saved their marriage.\n\nMain roles and screen credits, as appearing in the film:\n\nCapra and Columbia considered \"Dirigible\" as a step forward into the big time, with a $650,000 budget, the highest amount the studio had ever invested. Shot at Lakehurst, New Jersey, at the hangar that would house the U.S. Navy and later the \"Graf Zeppelin\" and the \"Hindenburg\". The Navy gave \"its full resources at Lakehurst\" including the pride of the fleet, the USS \"Los Angeles\" to lend an air of authenticity to the production. The \"Los Angeles\" was featured prominently and also portrayed the fictional USS \"Pensacola\". US Navy Lieutenant Commander Frank \"Spig\" Wead, a former pilot, was given the story credit and stayed on as a technical consultant.\n\nAs production began, the old Arcadia airfield was converted into a set, complete with \"artificial snow, fake ice mounds and painted backdrop attached to the back side of the dilapidated Army barracks.\" With principal photography slated for September, dry ice in metal containers stuffed in actor's mouths sufficed for the usual Arctic breath.\n\nTwo years later, Fay Wray played the leading role, a woman menaced by a giant gorilla, in the original version of \"King Kong\".\n\nThis film is historically important to aviation buffs. A mid-air docking and recovery of a fighter aircraft with a dirigible is shown. The crash of an airship during a storm is accurately depicted. The aircraft carrier USS \"Lexington\", with her 8-inch guns, can be spotted in the background during the takeoff of an aircraft.\n\nThe aerial cinematography was coordinated by Elmer Dyer.\n\n\"Dirigible\" was Capra's and Columbia's first film to be given prominence with a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, but despite high hopes, the film received lukewarm reviews. \"Variety\" called it \"unconvincing.\" A more recent review noted its \"odd mix of romantic cliches, nascent disaster elements, and adventurism ... It works, partly because Capra intermingles so much documentary-styled footage of the airship and Antarctic expedition.\" \n\n\n"}

Both sides of the family were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his maternal great-grandfather was a rabbi. The families escaped separately from anti-semitic pogroms. Some of his relatives who settled in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. His paternal grandparents, Max and Sarah Scharaga, came to the United States in 1898, and around 1920 his father changed their surname to Sherry. His father worked in the dry cleaning business, and his mother Mildred was a seamstress and milliner. The Sherry family moved to Los Angeles during the early 1930s.\n\nSherry attended Fairfax High School, and signed with the Dodgers while they were still in their original home of Brooklyn in .\n\nHis brothers, George and Larry Sherry, were pitchers in professional baseball. Larry had a successful, 11-season MLB career as a relief pitcher and was the Most Valuable Player of the 1959 World Series; he was Norm's teammate from 1959 through 1962 and on May 7, 1960, they became the first all-Jewish battery in Major League Baseball history.\n\nA right-handed hitter who stood tall and weighed , Norm Sherry spent seven years working his way up through the Dodger farm system, and another two in military service. By the time Norm reached the Dodgers, in 1959 for a two-game \"cup of coffee,\" he was 28 years of age and the team was based in his home city of Los Angeles. He made the team as second-string backstop (behind John Roseboro) from through . \n\nIn , Sherry's advice contributed to the career turnaround of left-handed pitcher Sandy Koufax, perhaps the greatest southpaw hurler in baseball history. Sherry and Koufax were the Dodger battery against the Minnesota Twins in a spring training game in Orlando, Florida, and Koufax was struggling with his control, up to then a career-long problem.\n\nAfter Koufax had walked the first three hitters he faced, Sherry went out to the mound and said: \"'Why don’t you take something off the ball and just put it in there? Don’t try to throw it so hard. Just put it in there and let them hit it.' I went back behind the plate. Good God! He tried to ease up, and he was throwing harder than when he tried to. We came off the field, and I said, 'Sandy, I don’t know if you realize it, but you just now threw harder than when you were trying to.'\"\n\nAs for Sherry, he batted .283 with eight home runs in a part-time role in 1960, but his statistics suffered as he sat on the bench, or in the bullpen, in 1961–62. His average dropped to .256 (), and then to .182 (1962).\n\nThe Dodgers sold his contract to the New York Mets on October 14, 1962. He batted only .136 in a career-high 63 games played (and 147 at-bats) in New York in , and his major league playing career ended.\n\nAll told, in 194 games over all or part of five seasons, Sherry batted .215 with 18 home runs, and .288 with runners in scoring position. He collected 107 total hits.\n\nIn 1965, Sherry began his managerial career in the Dodger organization, scouted for a year with the New York Yankees, and returned to managing in the California Angels' system in .\n\nHe coached for the Angels in and under skipper Lefty Phillips, and returned to the minor leagues to manage their Double-A and Triple-A affiliates from through before rejoining the California coaching staff for under Dick Williams.\n\nWilliams had been extremely successful in his previous terms with the Boston Red Sox and Oakland Athletics, but his cold and hard-edged demeanor did not go over well with a losing Angels club. The Halos were 18 games under the .500 mark on July 23, 1976, and in the midst of a player revolt when Williams was given his walking papers.\n\nSherry, named his replacement, salvaged the season somewhat with a 37–29 record as skipper. That winter, the Angels signed high-profile free agents such as Bobby Grich and Joe Rudi and expected to contend in the American League West in . But the team struggled and was only 39–42 and in 5th place on July 11 when Sherry was released in favor of his third-base coach, Dave Garcia. The firing marked the end of his major league managing career, with a career ledger of 76 wins and 71 defeats (.517). Through 2018, he was one of nine Jewish managers in MLB history. The others were Gabe Kapler, Bob Melvin, Brad Ausmus, Jeff Newman, Lou Boudreau, Lipman Pike, Larry Rothschild and Lefty Phillips.\n\nHowever, Sherry returned to the coaching ranks, ultimately as an \"official\" pitching coach, working with Williams with the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres, and with another ex-Dodger, Roger Craig, with the San Francisco Giants.\n\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 10,647, in an area of 75.11 km².\n\nIt is a planned city built in the 1980s, to serve the region's oil industry. It is, from all of Santiago do Cacém's parishes, the one nearer to the sea and it is surrounded as follows: to the North, by Melides; to the West, by the Atlantic Ocean; to the East, by Santiago do Cacém and Santa Cruz; and to the South, by Sines. It is one of the youngest cities in the world with approximately two years as a city and 30 years since it was founded. It is mostly a residential suburb for the industrial city of Sines, from which is about 10 miles.\n\nThe choice of Saint Andrew for patron of the Church that would give name to the present city (Cidade de Vila Nova de Santo André) and village (Aldeia de Santo André), simultaneously, is easily understood: Saint Andrew, brother of Saint Peter, was, like him, a fisherman, and the first of the two to meet and follow Christ.\nHis life is intimately connected to the sea and fishing culture as so was that of the people who lived in Aldeia de Santo André. It was promoted to city (Cidade) in 2003\n\nSurrounding the first church of Santo André the first houses sprung, as is natural, and, as expected, it inhabitants were deeply connected to the religious cult. Some of them preserved the church (where an old cemetery use to lay), while others were related to the fishing activities in Santo André's lagoon and others, still, were economically linked to the region's annual fair (that still exists nowadays).\n\nAccording to Father António Macedo e Silva, a precious source of information about the municipality of Santiago do Cacém, Santo André was created after other parishes in the municipality, either during the reign of D. João I (1385–1433) or during the reign of D. Duarte (1433–1438). All the rural parishes of this time, except for Santo André, already existed in the year of 1528.\nEither created in the 15th century or not, it is known for a fact that the parish already existed in the 16th century, with half a dozen houses that lived in the shadow of the Church who had given name to this place and whose population lived of the exploration of the lagoon, soil and fair commerce.\n\nAccording to the obtained information there was, in the Church, a \"very thick book and very old with a cover of sheep wool\", that certainly must have contained records of baptisms, deaths and marriages, as well as other important documents referring to the life of the locals. It is known, however, that the Church was built in 1834.\n\nSanto André, first a parish then a village, started to turn into a meeting point for people of the land and people of the sea.\n\nThe main income source was the rice culture. The rice cycle, that started in 1804, would only end in 1974, when the Gabinete da Área de Sines (an organism created on June 19, 1971, that created and managed the Santo André as an Urban Center up until the December 29, 1988, when it was extinct) started a new cycle that would come to be known as concrete cycle.\n\nIn the beginning of 1973, taking advantage of the oil exploration in that was taking place in Cabinda and providing huge amounts of oil, the Portuguese government decided to create and industrial complex destined to implant the petrochemical exploration in the country, and thus make a stand in the European context where industries of this type were already being developed and used to create wealth.\n\nThus, the Urban Center of Santo André was born, which would be raised to city on July 1, 2003.\n\nPrior to this large expropriations took place, and an area (integrated between the municipality of Santiago and Sines) was delineated for the birth of Santo André. The industrial platform eventually grew and came to be known as Complexo Petroquímico de Sines (Sines' Petrochemical Complex), where the country's largest oil refinery, Petrogal (former Petrosul), as well as other important industries (among which a thermal electrical power station and the to-be-biggest port of Europe), still operates.\n\nAs there was a preoccupation with the environment as well as with the health of the industrial complex's workers, Santo André was kept at a minimum distance of 10 km and a pine forest that works as a protection from eventual catastrophe.\n\nCoat of arms: Shield of silver with two green branches of orange tree, fruited in orange, crossed (St. Andrew's cross), with a black crow above and three blue and silver waves below. Three-towered mural crown in silver. White scroll with black lettering, in capitals, reading SANTO ANDRÉ - SANTIAGO DO CACÉM. Flag: blue, rope and tassels in silver and blue.\n\nSanto André is made up of seven urban areas/zones:\n\nSanto André is located in the region of Alentejo, in Portugal, and belongs to the municipality of Santiago do Cacém, in the subregion of Alentejo Litoral.\n\nIt is very near the sea (2 km) and also near the Alentejo Southwest and Vicentyne Coast, a protected area. Its climate is temperate, with monthly means ranging from 8 to 16 °C in the winter and 18 to 28 °C in the summer. \nAbsolute extremes are 0 °C in winter and 41 °C in summer.\nIn terms of precipitation, the climate is somewhat dry, with annual mean of 570–620 mm falling mostly between November and April.\nThin-sand soil can be found in some places and in the city there are a lot of pine trees.\n\nThere are some extensive sandy beaches within. The extensive forest that protects Santo André is a good example of possible respect between the protection of the environment and the industrial development.\n\nSanto André was built during the 1970s to answer the housing needs of the workers of the industrial complex of Sines. For the next two decades it attracted inhabitants from all over the country and especially people from Portugal's African ex-colonies. These people were mainly skilled technicians and people with an average education (9th–12th grade) or higher (university). This originated a very young population with a wealth considerably higher than the national average.\nSanto André's inhabitants enjoy a higher-than-average living quality, for which the beaches, as well as the proximity of the Natural Park of Southwest Alentejo and Costa Vicentina, help contribute.\nSines, only a few minutes from Santo André, by car, is one of the most dynamic cities of the Alentejo, having kept all its historical charm. It still represents a main center for development in the province of Alentejo, especially since the University was built in Santo André.\n\nBefore Santo André was built the locals made their livings from fishing (in the sea and in the lagoon), agriculture (mainly rice) and fairs.\nNowadays, industry is very important to the economy, giving work to thousands of the people of Santo André.\nLocal commerce is also important, but on a smaller scale.\n\nSanto André occupies an area of 74.32 km² with a population of 10,751 (1991 census), most of whom are Roman Catholic.\n\nIn the beginning of 2005 it was considered to have about 14,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nBeaches\n\nThere are beaches of fine sand.\nThe paths of the \"Blue Coast\" (as it is classified) seem to characterize the landscape of Alentejo.\nThe first impression one has (when in Portugal) when talking about the Alentejo is the image of a burning plain (this is one of Portugal's hottest regions). However, there are dozens of kilometers of beach throughout the coast of Alentejo, ranging from Sado's southern margin (in Tróia) to the beginning of the Algarve.\nThe giant extension of sand that connects Tróia to Sines, with over 60 km, has some of the best beaches in Portugal (better water quality, cleaner sand and water, as well as good surf spots, than most of the country). They include:\n\nLagoons\nUp to the 17th century, Santo André's Lagoon this lagoon was called Lagoa de Pêra (\"Pear Lagoon\") and was always communicating with the sea\nNowadays it is kept \"closed\" from contact with the sea most of the time, but sometimes (for health purposes) the water is \"renewed\".\nThe lagoon and the beach are a perfect match when it comes to creating a splendid place on its calm waters, with the green from the wild pine trees and low flights of birds their combination makes for a heavenly place to rest, defining the most direct contact in nature-type holidays.\nIt is considered a Wet Spot of International Importance, for there are some bird species that do their nests in its surrounding and for being the biggest lagoon system of all of Alentejo's Coast, offering a landscape of particular interest and great natural conditions, a fundamental aspect of attraction to becoming a great tourist center in a delicate and tranquil environment.\nIts connection to the sea is made once per year - by Man - in Spring, thus matching the reproduction periods of numerous marine species. \nThe nature reserve of the Lagoons of Santo André and Sancha is one of the most emblematic places of Santo André, one where we can enjoy the variety of fauna and flora of this region, and which is chosen for the protection of a very rich diversity of aquatic birds: ducks, geese, cranes, grebes, curlews, gannets and coots, that used to be hunted every year. It is also the passing ground for many migratory birds.\nThere are some otter shelters in the Lagoons.\n\nSanto André also the following amenities:\n\nSanto André has three primary schools: EB2, EB3 and EB4 and one school with 5th to 9th grade (covering the last two basic education levels).\n\nIt also has a secondary school named Padre António Macedo which is an extended secondary school, with students from the 7th grade to the 12th grade.\n\nSanto André, although small, contains a University Campus made up by Instituto Superior de Estudos Interculturais e Transdisciplinares, loosely translated as \"Higher Education Institute for Intercultural and Transdiciplinary Studies\" and has based its teaching policy in the region's characteristics: Sines' industries, the lacks of the Alentejo interior and its potential as a tourist region. To find a suitable example between the academic environment and Santo André's surroundings one needs only to go to the beach after school.\nThis institute's activity was started in the year 2002. The following courses can be studied:\nThe latter one is supported actively by a local Hotel, Vila Park, a project associated with the Piaget Institute.\nThe Higher Education School of Health will be teaching health-related subjects in the future.\nThe campus has labs, computer rooms and a library, as well as facilities for sports and services.\nOther facilities include: an amphitheatre, an auditorium, a fitness gym, a psycomotion therapy room and an exposition room.\n"}

Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge located in southern New Jersey along the Atlantic coast north of Atlantic City, in Atlantic and Ocean counties. The refuge was created in 1984 out of two existing refuge parcels created to protect tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat for migratory water birds. The Barnegat Division (established in 1967) is located in Ocean County on the inland side of Barnegat Bay. The Brigantine Division (established in 1939) is located approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of Atlantic City along the south bank of the mouth of the Mullica River. The two divisions are separated by approximately 20 miles (32 km). The refuge is located along most active flight paths of the Atlantic Flyway, making it an important link in the network of national wildlife refuges administered nationwide by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Forsythe Refuge is a part of the Hudson River/New York Bight Ecosystem and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The refuge is named for Edwin B. Forsythe, conservationist Congressman from New Jersey.\n\nThe Refuge protects more than 40,000 acres (162 km) of southern New Jersey Coastal Habitats and tidal wetlands. 6,000 acres (24 km) of the refuge are designated as a wilderness area, meaning that public access is limited or even entirely prohibited at times. These areas include Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in the state. Here the rare piping plover and other beach-nesting birds raise their young.\n\nThe beach areas provide fragile ecosystems for birds whose populations have already been impacted by development, so Holgate is closed to all public during the nesting season; Little Beach is closed all year except by special permit for research or education. Almost 90% of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Each year thousands of ducks and geese, wading birds and shorebirds concentrate here during spring and fall migration, making the Refuge a good site for birdwatching, nature photography and related activities. More than 3,000 acres (12 km) of the Refuge are woodlands with a wide variety of tree and plant species, thus also providing vital habitat for a variety of upland species such as songbirds, woodcock, white-tailed deer and box turtles.\n\nPrimary access to this refuge is by automobile and bicycle. While there are no specific guided programs, visitors may drive an eight-mile (13 km) long trail over dams guided by a brochure which points out the various features. Foot travelers can walk one of four trails which range from 1/4 mile () to in length.\n\nA team from the University of Pennsylvania and the British Geological Survey have measured organic pollutants and mercury in the sediments within the refuge and Barnegat Bay and Little Egg Harbor. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were found in low amounts in creek and marsh sediments. Evaluation of the PAH compound distribution suggested that most of the creeks received small amounts of PAH derived from burning of wood or coal and or traffic sources.\n\n"}

He is currently head trainer for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).\n\nSciarra was born in Seymour, Indiana on February 7, 1954. He graduated from Seymour High School in 1972 and went on to attend Indiana Central College, graduating in 1976. Sicarra worked as a teacher for a year before deciding to become a professional wrestler.\n\nRip Rogers started wrestling in 1977. He formed the \"Convertible Blondes\" with Pez Whatley and Gary Royal in Angelo Poffo's International Championship Wrestling (ICW) and won the Tag Team Titles with Royal. As with The Fabulous Freebirds defending regional NWA tag team championships with any two of the three members, the Convertible Blondes also used the so-called \"Freebird Rule\" to defend the ICW Tag Team Championship in this manner. He left the ICW following a dispute with Angelo Poffo's son Randy Poffo, better known by his ring name Randy Savage.\n\nIn 1979, Rogers went to the National Wrestling Alliance's Portland territory, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he was aligned with Buddy Rose and Ed Wiskoski. He would also make trips to Vancouver's All-Star Wrestling.\n\nIn 1984, he went to the Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett Promotions, where he formed \"The Hollywood Blonds\" with Ted Oates and won the National Tag Team Titles. By early 1986, he was in the Memphis territory, Continental Wrestling Association, feuding with Dutch Mantel.\n\nIn September 1986, \"The Hustler,\" managed by his then-wife Brenda Britton, joined Continental Championship Wrestling and immediately feuded with \"The Exotic\" Adrian Street and Miss Linda, until leaving the Gulf Coast area in March 1987.\n\nRogers wrestled as a heel in Bob Geigel's Central States promotion during most of 1987.\n\nThe Ripper spent most of 1988 and 1989 in Calgary Stampede Wrestling. Strangely given his history and reputation he was mainly a lower to mid card performer. Yet he always seemed to get a rise out of the crowd as an antagonizing heel. Rogers received a small push near the end of his run in Stampede (the territory shut up shop at the end of '89). When he teamed with longtime Stampede veteran Kerry Brown as part of the Midnight Cowboys tag team. They had a running feud with popular International Tag Team Champs Bad Company, which included Bruce Hart & Flyin' Brian Pillman.\n\nIn 1989, he wrestled for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico as one of their top heels with partner Abbuda Dein.\n\nHe was back in the NWA in time for it to be renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW) he wrestled in WCW from 1991 to 1994 as a jobber and he lost several matches to Pillman. Rogers later substituted for Pillman, being the scapegoat in the ill-fated Yellow Dog angle. His biggest win was at Battlebowl in 1993 where he teamed with Road Warrior Hawk and defeated Davey Boy Smith & Booker T (then named Kole). By late 1993, he had left WCW for the Global Wrestling Federation where he joined The Cartel, which included Scotty Anthony, Makhan Singh and Cactus Jack. They were the top heels for several months and he created a lot of havoc while there.\n\nAfter that run, he occasionally wrestled in the United States, wrestling for a time with a promotion in Indianapolis known as Circle City Wrestling. He finally settled in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in 1997. He teamed with Dave the Rave and formed the \"Suicide Blondes\" with Jason Lee. When he retired from active competition in 2000, he was named head trainer at OVW. At the age of 48, Rogers was hit by a car and sustained injuries which forced him to completely retire from in-ring competition; according to a 2011 story on OVW, the accident left him \"with a stiff limp\". Rogers currently runs an advanced wrestling class at OVW, where he teaches up and coming wrestlers.\n\nAs head trainer for OVW, Rogers has been involved in training over thirty wrestlers who appeared in WWE or Impact Wrestling, notably including Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Mark Henry, Dave Bautista, and Randy Orton.\n\nRogers was known for his berserk reaction after losing a match. Even after being cleanly pinned, Rogers would vociferously protest to the referee that his opponent had cheated. Usually, he would claim that his hair or trunks had been pulled by the other wrestler to score the victory. These claims would be accompanied by a frenzied voice and wild pantomimes of hair and trunk pulling.\n\nRip also fought in 3 pro boxing matches in 1996 at 41 years old. His record stands at 1 win, 1 loss, 1 draw, with 1 TKO. He was trained by longtime friend Bobby 'Sweetpain' Duchi a veteran pro boxer, kickboxer, and champion weightlifter.\n\nRip made an appearance in the 1993 music video for \"Human Wheels\" by fellow Seymour native John Mellencamp.\n\nRip has done some appearances on The Pat McAfee show podcast while it was part of Barstool Sports.\n\nSciarra is married.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1901332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901332", "title": "Jacob Golos", "text": "Jacob Golos\n\nJacob Golos (born Yakov Naumovich Reizen, Яков Наумович Рейзен; April 24, 1889 - November 27, 1943) was a Ukrainian-born Bolshevik revolutionary who became an intelligence operative in the United States on behalf of the USSR. A founding member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), \"circa\" 1930 Golos became involved in the covert work of Soviet intelligence agencies. He participated in procuring American passports by means of fraudulent documentation, and the recruitment and coordination of activities of a broad network of agents.\n\nYakov Naumovich Reizen was born April 24, 1889, in Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire, since 2016 known as Dnipro in Ukraine, to a Jewish family. Yakov's father worked as a shop assistant. In addition to Yakov, the Reizen family included two more sons and three daughters. Yakov was registered as Jacob Naumovich Golosenko (the entry in the register, Holy Trinity Church in the city of Ekaterinoslav).\n\nA revolutionary from a young age, Reizen joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1904, becoming active in the group's Bolshevik wing headed by V.I. Lenin. He participated in the 1905 Revolution, serving as a member of the first soviet of Ekaterinoslav, the city known today as Dnipro.\n\nIn 1906 Reizen organized an illegal revolutionary printing press, for which he was arrested in the last days of that year. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to eight years of hard labor, a term ultimately commuted by the government of Tsar Nikolai II to lifetime exile to Yakutia in northern Siberia.\n\nReizen escaped by fleeing to the east, traveling to the United States by way of China and via a ship from Japan. In the United States at some point, he adopted the surname \"Golos,\" by which he will subsequently be known here. In 1909 Golos reached San Francisco, California, where he obtained work in a print shop as a pressman.\n\nBy 1912, Golos had found his way to New York City, where he helped to raise funds for political prisoners in Russia. Golos was active in the Russian Socialist Federation in May 1915 he gained membership in the Socialist Party of America when the Russian Federation joined that party.\n\nGolos returned to California in 1917, where he supported himself by working for fruit picking and packing firms. He also worked as an organizer for the Socialist Party of California. He remained in California until 1919.\n\nToward the end of August 1919, Golos was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Federation by the organization's 5th Convention, held in Detroit, Michigan. Immediately after the close of the Detroit gathering, Golos and a number of his comrades in the Russian Federation, including Alexander Stoklitsky and Nicholas Hourwich, traveled to Chicago to attend another convention. This one established the Communist Party of America, forerunner of the Communist Party, USA.\n\nIn his personal history and personnel forms written in Moscow in 1926, Golos dated his work as a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Section (New York) as from 1919-1925. In December 1922, Golos was elected to the nine-member Bureau of the Russian Federation of the Workers Party of America, the \"legal\" public face of the then-underground Communist Party of America.\n\nIn 1921-1922, Golos worked as an organizer at the Communist Party HQ in Chicago. In 1922-1923 he was an organizer for the organization in its Detroit district. In 1923 Golos became head of the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, one of the party's technological aid initiatives; he worked in that capacity until 1926.\n\nIn 1926 Golos traveled to the Soviet Union as a participant in the American \"Kuzbas\" (Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony), located near the Russian city of Kemerovo. His membership was transferred to the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), the VKP(b), in this interval. When the Kuzbas project was essentially terminated in 1927, Golos was transferred to Moscow. There he was offered a job in a book publishing house.\n\nIn 1927 a Communist Party-sponsored travel agency, called World Tourists, Inc.s, was established. Golos would later become closely connected to it in the United States. Originally started as an economic venture intended to help subsidize the Communist Party's press, the firm ultimately served not only as the coordinator of propaganda tours to the Soviet Union but also as a means to facilitate the travel of party officials and Soviet agents between the USSR and the USA, sometimes under the cover of falsified documentation.\n\nIn September 1928, American Communist Party leader Jay Lovestone, noting Golos' \"significant influence among the Russian working masses in the United States,\" sent an appeal to the Central Committee of the VKP(b) to have Golos be returned to the United States for work. He made a second appeal along these lines in December 1928, and Golos returned to the United States around January 1929.\n\nGolos settled again in New York City, this time in the borough of the Bronx. He worked as the business manager of \"Novyi Mir\" (New World), the Communist Party's Russian-language newspaper, based in New York. . Included in Golos' activities was coordination of the CPUSA's operation to produce false passports for party members wanting to travel abroad. Golos remained in charge of the passport operation until turning the job over to Hungarian party functionary J. Peters, who also served as a link with the Soviet intelligence in 1930s. According to Peters' biographer the transfer took place in 1932.\n\nIn the spring of 1930, Golos became involved in the Communist Party's \"machinery of investigations,\" charged with keeping tabs with the activities of a number of labor unions and party-affiliated mass organizations. He appears to have begun working for the secret intelligence apparatus of the Soviet Union by this time, as it was in 1930 that he is first referred to in archival documents as a \"reliable man.\"\n\nAccording to archival notes taken in the early 1990s by Alexander Vassiliev, a former KGB foreign intelligence officer and journalist, Golos' initial contact seems to have been with the GPU's New York station chief, Chivin (\"Smith\"). Another interpretation of the documents, favored by historian Svetlana Chervonnaya, argues that first contact was made by Abram Einhorn (\"Taras\"), a Soviet intelligence agent who worked in the United States from 1930 to 1934. It is clear that by the early 1930s, Golos was in the employ of Soviet intelligence.\n\nBy the start of 1933, Golos was heading the Communist Party's World Tourists venture, an operation that generated revenue and provided funds for various CPUSA activities. Golos was active in the acquisition and supply of American naturalization papers and birth certificates, which were used to obtain American passports to \"legalize\" Soviet intelligence agents around the world — initially in Europe and Asia, but later in the Americas as well. In order to convert these fraudulent application papers into authentic passports, Golos worked closely with a clerk in the Brooklyn passport office. That person had been recruited because of his vulnerability of a gambling addiction.\n\nDuring this period Golos was identified by his Soviet intelligence handlers with the code name \"Sound\" — a pun on his adopted surname of Golos, the Russian word for \"voice.\"\n\nThroughout the 1930s Golos was a member of the CPUSA's Central Control Commission, a body in charge of party discipline, background investigations, and audits. He could assist in the recruitment and verification of potential agents on behalf of Soviet intelligence.\n\nAs head of World Tourists, Golos visited the Soviet Union every year from 1932 onward to attend the celebrations of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. This coincidentally gave him an opportunity to bring his Russian-born wife and American-born son there in 1936, so that his son could receive \"a Soviet education.\" In 1937, the pair gained Soviet citizenship.\n\nThe last of these visits took place in 1937, during the height of the \"Ezhovshchina\" (or the Great Purge)— the mass campaign by Stalin of secret police terror in which millions of Soviet citizens suspected of political disloyalty, espionage, or economic crime were arrested, and hundreds of thousands executed. Millions more were sent to the brutal labor camps of the Gulag. Upon his return to the United States in January 1938, Golos confirmed at a session of the governing Political Committee of the American Communist Party that there was indeed a mass secret police operation in effect in the USSR. Golos' faith in the communist cause seems to have remained unshaken in the aftermath.\n\nVassiliev's notes revealed that in late 1940, Golos recruited author Ernest Hemingway, assigning him the code name: \"Argo\"; the author had offered to work covertly for the Soviets.\n\nFrom 1940 onward Golos was subject to the Foreign Agent Registration Act. While he did not curtail his NKVD activities, he had to assume he was under FBI surveillance. Moscow became nervous at the risk of him being arrested and made attempts to convince him to return to Russia. Worried that if he returned to the Soviet Union he would be jailed or killed, Golos not only refused to share his sources with other NKVD officers, but he also told them that he had hidden a sealed envelope containing details of Russia's spy operations in America.\n\nIn 1941, Golos had set up a commercial forwarding enterprise, called the U.S. Shipping and Service Corporation. He assigned Elizabeth Bentley, his assistant, courier and lover, as one of its officers. The pair occupied a suite in the Commodore Hotel, in New York City, across the street from Amtorg.\n\nIn 1942, Golos transferred a Communist cell of engineers headed by Julius Rosenberg into direct contact with Soviet intelligence operatives in New York. The cell provided information on newest developments in electrical and radio engineering to the XY Line of the NKGB foreign intelligence. The XY Line began efforts to penetrate the Manhattan Project, code-named ENORMOUS (ENORMOZ).\n\nSometime in November 1943, Golos met in New York with key figures of one of the so-called \"information groups\" of the CPUSA, which would come to be known as the Perlo group. Its members worked in several government departments and agencies in Washington, D.C. and provided information to the CPUSA leader, Browder, the General Secretary of the Communist Party USA.\n\nGolos suffered a series of heart attacks during the first years of the 1940s. On November 27, 1943, a fatal heart attack ended his life while he was sleeping with Elizabeth Bentley. Immediately Bentley began a search for a secret file that Golos had kept to protect himself from being recalled to Russia; she destroyed it. Following his death, Bentley took over Golos's espionage operations.\n\nThe code name \"Zvuk\" (Sound) appears in the Venona decryptions as a Soviet source; this has been identified as Jacob Golos. In these decrypts, Golos is identified as an \"illegal colleague,\" generally meaning a Soviet officer or professional agent who operated without the protection of diplomatic or official status with a Soviet embassy or consulate. Soviet officers with the latter status were said to be \"legal.\"\n\nGolos's legacy can be read about in books by Harry Dexter White, Nathan G. Silvermaster, and Elizabeth Bentley.\n\n\n\n"}

The original parent company was Schäffer & Budenberg founded in 1850 by and in Prussia. The Budenberg Gauge Company is now based in Irlam, Salford. The company is renowned for the manufacture of high quality pressure gauges, thermometers, valves and manifolds. Budenberg also produce monoflanges and close coupled systems, chemical seals, hygienic seals, and transmitters.\nIn 1849, B. Schäffer patented the design of a diaphragm pressure gauge. The following year he formed a business partnership with his brother-in-law C.F. Budenberg, \"The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & Boiler Fittings Company\", in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing pressure gauges and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau. The company became known by the shorter name of The Schäffer & Budenberg Manufacturing Company (S&B) \"a special factory for the production of fine mechanical instruments\". However, locally in Buckau they were always known as 'Schäffers'. Export success on the back of the every increasing steam industry led to the formation of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries all over the world. In c1875 the company produced its first Bourdon type pressure gauges thanks to the expiry of patents. They opened American Schäffer & Budenberg office & factory in Brooklyn, New York in 1876, and briefly a second factory in Foxboro, Massachusetts. They had 5 factories, 4 depots, 25 offices and numerous agencies over five continents by the beginning of WWI employing nearly 8,000.\n\nThe company's history in Manchester began in 1855 when Arnold Budenberg, the younger brother of C.F. Budenberg, established a sales office in St. Mary's Gate. A Glasgow office opened in Hope Street in 1861. In 1876 the assembly of pressure gauges and other instruments began in Manchester. Arnold's son Fred Budenberg took over the running of the Manchester operation in 1888. The company continued to expand and relocated to a larger factory in Whitworth Street in 1896. In the decades running up to the First World War and the race for naval superiority, products had to be made in Britain if the company wanted to sell to the British Admiralty. To cement this the company was registered as British in 1902, even though it was still almost completely owned and controlled from Germany.\n\nIn 1914, the company moved from Whitworth Street to a new purpose built factory at Woodfield Road, Broadheath, Altrincham. Following the outbreak of war with Germany, Schaeffer & Budenberg was one of many German owned companies in the United Kingdom to be expropriated by the British Crown. Following the seizure of the company's Manchester subsidiary, Fred Budenberg (who was British born), was ordered to continue to run the business by the British Government for the duration of the war. Both of Fred's sons were fighting for the British in France. In 1917 Fred bought the company back from the British Crown, with the proviso by the Crown that all Board Directors were English born, and so the Budenberg Gauge Company Ltd. was formed and shares were held by a Public Trustee. The American branch was taken over by the Alien Property Custodian in 1917 and sold off in May 1919 to the American Gauge and Valve Co, with no continuing family connection, although it continued to operate as an independent entity until 1923. American Gauge was then bought by Manning Maxwell Moore and S&B continued as a separate division, even though sometimes working from the same premises. The Italian branch was liquidated by the Italian Government in 1915. The company business connections in St. Petersburg, Riga, Moscow, Vladivostock & Kiev were severed with the war and the Russian Revolution. The South American agencies stayed connected with the German company. The French and Belgian offices continued to operate by the Germans during the war. The Swedish and Swiss offices continued in a lesser way in neutral territories. The Polish, Czech and Austrian factories continued to operate as they were essential to the German war effort. The Warsaw factory ceased operations at the end of 1918, but there was a factory at Lodz at one period.\nA new office started in The Hague in 1918, and the offices in Lille and Liege continued after the war. During the huge inflation of 1923 in Germany the factory had problems with output and cash flow. Hitler's early preparations for the 1939-1945 war ensured the Germany company's existence and growth. During the Second World War the Magdeburg-Buckau factory was badly bombed and 60% of it was destroyed. It continued to operate under the Schaeffer & Budenberg name until 1946 when it was taken over and run by the Soviets as a form of war reparation. Its name was changed to the Karl Marx Messgeräte & Armaturenwerke in the newly communist East Germany. The British company, Budenberg Gauge continued to provide gauges for all areas of pressure work and flourished after a slow period in the 1950s due to the inability to source raw materials post WWII.\n\nIn 1961 the individual states agencies for Australia came back under Budenberg Gauge Co., and Budenberg Australia Pty Ltd was set up with a factory in Melbourne. Two years later a third factory was opened in Amlwch, Anglesey. Budenberg Gauge remained a family-owned company from its inception in 1850 until 1991 when it was sold to Burnfield plc.\nIn 2002 the company vacated its historic Broadheath factory and moved to Irlam, where it continues to manufacture pressure gauges and accessories.\n\nIn 1996 DH-Budenberg was established from the merger of Desgranges & Huot from France (known widely as \"DH\") and the calibration division of Budenberg Gauge Co.\nBudenberg had been manufacturing pressure calibration equipment - deadweight testers and calibrators - since the 1920s.\nThe newly formed company DH-Budenberg Group has since expanded the calibration equipment produced, to a wide range of primary standard & premium industrial pressure calibration equipment, which now includes: automated primary pressure standards, manual primary standards, differential primary standards, automatic pressure controllers, hydraulic, pneumatic, and portable deadweight testers, and a range of portable calibrators. Along with manufacturing bases in Manchester UK, Paris France & Rodgau Germany, recent DH-Budenberg expansion has included opening new offices in San Marcos - Texas, Dubai - UAE, Chennai - India, Singapore, & Perth - Australia.\n\n"}

It was the first free election held in Portugal since 1925, and only the seventh free election in all of Portuguese history. Turnout was a record 91.66 percent, which remains (as of 2017) the highest ever in any Portuguese democratic elections (General, Regional, Local or European).\n\nThe main aim of the election was the election of a Constituent Assembly, in order to write a new constitution to replace the Estado Novo regime's authoritarian Constitution of 1933 and so this freely-elected parliament had a single-year mandate and no government was based on parliamentary support; the country continued to be governed by a military-civilian provisional administration during the deliberations of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe election was won by the Socialist Party. The Social Democratic Party (then known as the \"Democratic People's Party\", PPD) was the second-most voted party, defending a project that it would soon abandon, social democratic centrism, the Portuguese \"Social-Democracy\" becoming the major right-wing party in the country a few years after. The parliament had a large majority of parties defending socialist or \"democratic socialist\" ideas and the Constitution, approved one year after, reflected such influence. The Portuguese Communist Party achieved a surprisingly low total, considering the overwhelming support in the south of the country and the radical turn to the left of the revolutionary process after the failed fascist coup, one month before.\n\nWith the PPD's shift away from the left and towards the right coming after this election, the only right-of-centre party elected was the CDS, which received 7.6 percent of the vote and 16 seats.\n\nThe previous parliamentary elections were held on October 28, 1973, still under the authoritarian rule of the Estado Novo (New State). The People's National Action (ANP), the single party of the president of the council Marcelo Caetano had won the all 150 deputies of the National Assembly, with a participation rate of 66.5% of registered.\n\nOn April 25, 1974, the Carnation Revolution, initiated by the captains of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), ended the authoritarian regime established in 1932 by António de Oliveira Salazar. After the revolutionary forces proclaimed victory, the National Salvation Junta, presided by General António de Spínola, takes over the position of Head of State and Government.\n\nWith political parties once again legal, the Socialist Party (PS) leader, Mário Soares, and the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) Secretary General, Álvaro Cunhal, return to Portugal less than a week later. In addition, the members of the \"liberal wing\" of the ANP, favorable to a democratization of the \"Estado Novo\" before its fall, found the Democratic People's Party (PPD) which claimed to be social democratic.\n\nAt the end of three weeks, Spínola takes the oath as President of the Republic, and nominates Adelino da Palma Carlos Prime Minister as the head of the 1st provisional government where civil and military members plus independent, socialists, social democrats and communists were also part of.\n\nAs early as July 18, Vasco Gonçalves, a military man seen as very close to the Communist Party, replaces Palma Carlos as head of the government. After this, the first party that doesn't claim to be from the left or the center-left appears, the Democratic and Social Center (CDS), which says to be an advocate to Christian democracy and liberalism.\n\nBarely two and a half months later, after failing to carry out a counter-revolution, Spínola resigns as President of the Republic and is replaced by General Francisco da Costa Gomes, his deputy in the National Salvation Junta. On March 19, 1975, President Costa Gomes officially calls an election to elect members to write a new Constitution.\n\nThe electoral system adopted, set by the electoral law approved on November 15, 1974, establishes the election of members of parliament by proportional representation according to the D'Hondt method, known to benefit the parties that come first.\n\nThe law fixes the number of one deputy per 25,000 inhabitants and one more per fraction of 12,500. Deputies were elected in twenty-three constituencies, namely the eighteen metropolitan districts, Horta, Ponta Delgada, Angra do Heroísmo, Funchal, Mozambique, Macau, and the rest of the world.\n\nIn application of these provisions, 250 seats were to be filled.\n\nThe major parties involved and the respective leaders:\n\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=left|Parties\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|%\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=\"center\"|MPs\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:right;\" |MPs %/votes %\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align=center|1975\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|%\n\n!rowspan=2|Constituency!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S\n!rowspan=2|TotalS\n!colspan=2 | PS\n!colspan=2 | PPD\n!colspan=2 | PCP\n!colspan=2 | CDS\n!colspan=2 | MDP/CDE\n!colspan=2 | UDP\n!colspan=2 | ADIM\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901353", "title": "Stand by Me (Oasis song)", "text": "Stand by Me (Oasis song)\n\n\"Stand by Me\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis, written by lead guitarist, Noel Gallagher. It was the second single to be released from the band's third album, \"Be Here Now\".\n\nThe song peaked at number two in the UK charts in September 1997, being kept from the top spot by the record-breaking Elton John single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", which was re-recorded and released in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died three weeks before the release of \"Stand by Me\". Despite this, \"Stand by Me\" still went gold in the UK, and would eventually reach platinum status in 2019. It ended up at number 46 on the end of year charts in the United Kingdom for 1997. The song also reached number two in Ireland and reached the top 10 in Finland, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden.\n\nNoel Gallagher claims to have written the song whilst suffering from food poisoning when he first moved to London. His mother Peggy would phone him to check on him and repeatedly told him to ensure he was eating properly. This spurred Gallagher to cook himself a proper British Sunday dinner, which resulted in a bout of food poisoning. In a 1997 interview promoting \"Be Here Now\", Noel Gallagher had the following to say: \"It starts, 'Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday'. When I first moved to London me mam kept on ringing up and asking was I eating properly. Yes, Mam. So I tried to cook a Sunday roast and puked up for two days with food poisoning. It was back to Pot Noodles after that.\"\n\nThe title for the song likely comes from the Ben E. King song \"Stand by Me\", which was covered by the Gallaghers' idol John Lennon. In a characteristic example of Noel Gallagher lifting elements from songs of which he is fond, the rousing sequence of chord changes between the repeated chorus lyrics 'Stand by me/Nobody knows the way it's gonna be' bears a remarkable similarity to a similar chord sequence in Mott The Hoople's \"All the Young Dudes\", acknowledged by Gallagher: \"It's a bit like \"Live Forever\", I suppose, with a touch of \"All the Young Dudes\" in the background—though I made sure I changed the chords.\"\n\nDue to Noel Gallagher's general dislike of \"Be Here Now\", \"Stand by Me\" was rarely played live by the band at their concerts after the Be Here Now Tour, as it was Noel who usually decided the set lists for Oasis' tours. A live version of the song from this tour can be found on the double-CD version of \"Familiar to Millions\".\n\nA well-known acoustic version of \"Stand by Me\" was shown on television the night before the release of \"Be Here Now\" as part of a BBC One documentary, featuring Noel, Liam Gallagher and drummer Alan White sitting by the side of a swimming pool, with Liam on vocals, Noel on acoustic guitar and White playing tambourine. This version became available with the 2016 \"Chasing The Sun\" edition of \"Be Here Now\".\n\nThe video for the song was shot on 20 September 1997. It was a reworking of a famous series of adverts for \"The Guardian\" newspaper. Entitled 'The Whole Picture', the adverts showed people appearing to be engaging in criminal and/or anti-social acts—only for it to be revealed that they are actually helping someone else. For example, a scruffily-dressed skinhead rushes at a businessman; it appears he is making an effort to mug him and break into his car, when he is actually getting it open for the businessman who locked the key inside it. Similarly, the music video shows a shop appearing to be being burgled — its window is smashed and people are taking away electrical goods — only for it to be revealed that in fact the victim of a motorcycle crash has gone through the window and is buried under the goods. At the same time, a man who was earlier shown to be apparently running away from approaching police officers was actually rushing to save a girl from being run over by the motorcycle — the officers just happened to come by at that time. The video was filmed in the suburban town of Feltham, in west London.\n\nCD (Promo) \n\nCD \n\n7\" / Cassette / CD (Promo) \n\n12\" \n\n\n"}

It was also known as Miller Canyon.\n\nNichols Canyon was named after John Gregg Nichols Jr., reputed to be \"the first child born of American parents in Los Angeles\" (in 1851). Nichols' ranch in the canyon was referred to as a \"goat pasture.\"\nJacob Miller, a \"pioneer avocado grower,\" and his wife, Dorothy, bought seventy acres of the property in 1879, and the area became known as Miller Canyon. Mrs. Miller said in 1926:\n\nOf course we had many hardships, not the least of which was having to drive through dust in summer and mud in winter to the hamlet of Los Angeles for our mail and supplies. There was nothing where Hollywood is now except a small ranch house. But we loved the hills and our beautiful canyon and were happy in our home and family.\"\n\nNichols Canyon Road, leading north from Hollywood Boulevard, was completed to Mulholland Highway via Courtney Street in 1925. In 1926 the Automobile Club of Southern California reported that Nichols Canyon was traversed by a \"good dirt road.\"\n\nIn 1929, plans were made to widen the Nichols Canyon thoroughfare to serve \"as a major gateway for traffic flowing between North Hollywood, Burbank, San Fernando Valley cities, Pasadena and West Hollywood.\" The idea was to widen the roadway, referred to as a northward \"extension\" of Genessee Street, to 46 feet, \"with six inches of asphaltic concrete, through Hollywood Boulevard Estates to Mullholland High Way.\" Work would include \"sewers, water, gas, lights, storm drains and electroliers.\" Grading of the Nichols Canyon road had already been \"completed and paid for by individual property owners, who have installed water connections the full length of the thoroughfare.\"\n\nA 1930 report also stated that the canyon road would be renamed Genessee and would be extended north \"to the Hollywood Boulevard Estates property line on Mulholland High Way.\" It was to be \"developed as the main west lane of traffic through the hills\" and would be \"comparable with Cahuenga Pass, the main east channel.\"\n\nIn 1914, the canyon had a \"sparkling stream which the trail crosses about twenty times\" and which \"splashes over rocks fifty feet high,\" forming a pool below.\n\nIt was Dorothy Miller who was responsible for the exotic trees and shrubbery that eventually came to blanket Nichols Canyon. She planted and nurtured tropical seeds which an uncle gave her. They would not grow in the climate of his nursery in Downtown Los Angeles \"but grew wonderfully in the frostless foothill belt.\" The Millers used Chinese laborers.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" said, 'It was due to the love of a woman for plants, in a day when it was not fashionable for ladies to garden, that most of the subtropical plantings in Nichols Canyon, or Miller Canyon, as it is sometimes called, were begun.\"\n\nIn 1997, James Sowell, the manager of environmental compliance for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority noted the natural beauty of the three-mile-long canyon: \"It's spectacular,\" he said. \"The water comes down from two different directions. If you've driven up Nichols Canyon, part of it looks like a rain forest.\n\nFlora in the area by the end of the 20th century included Western sycamore, acacia, laurel sumac and California holly. \"Lush canyon bottoms,\" said the \"Los Angeles Times,\" \"made a carpet of verdure which became \"oases for wildlife.\"\n\nBrush fires have struck the canyon over the years. One fire in 1904 was reported to have \"utterly devastated\" not only Nichols Canyon but also \"Laurel Canyon adjacent to it,\" \"many square miles\" being \"denuded of timber and all vegetation.\" A fire was extinguished on an extension road in Astral Drive between Curson and Nichols Canyon in September 1956. Three years later, residents had to flee another blaze that whipped through Laurel land Nichols canyons and destroyed homes.\n\nFire believed started in a homeless encampment, or by a homeless man cooking dinner in the brush above Hollywood Boulevard, threatened between forty and sixty homes in August 2005 but was quelled by firefighters.\n\nIn 1913 the canyon was centered by a natural channel, or a wash, which crossed Sunset Boulevard at the south. A storm on February 25 of that year washed out the crossing.\n\nHomes in Nichols Canyon suffered major damage or were swept away when a rainstorm drenched Southern California on New Year's Day, 1931. The next August, the City Council allocated $46,000 for a large debris basin at the foot of the canyon, which residents had sought for years.\n\nIn 1981 Nichols Canyon, as well as Laurel Canyon, Mandeville Canyon and Bandini Canyon, was threatened by the possibility of heavy rain damage when it was revealed that the city lacked funds to continue with flood-control projects. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported:\n\nIronically, funds were once available to correct the major flood-control problem in Nichols Canyon. But the repeated opposition of canyon residents to construction of a storm-drain system serving the length of Nichols Canyon Road caused the city to divert funds elsewhere.\n\nIn 1908, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the establishment of a factory in the canyon to manufacture an explosive called Satanite, even after \"Hollywood citizens and representatives of civic bodies\" had protested. The approval followed demonstrations of the safety of the new product by company officials while a crowd of a hundred watched.\n\nComplaints were raised in 1912 about dust from the quarries in Nichols Canyon. The City Council ordered the road closed, but \"this was not satisfactory.\" The quarry owners agreed to \"furnish free of cost and spread upon the street the necessary gravel and crushed rock, and the city will oil the street.\"\n\nIn 1997, Nichols Canyon residents reached a settlement with the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority because, the residents said, the construction of a subway through Hollywood was drying up the foliage in the canyon and surrounding areas. Pumping of water flooding the tunnel beneath the Santa Monica Mountains was draining the entire Hollywood basin of up to a third of its annual capacity. Resident John Chickering said: \"It was unbelievable. I looked out of my window one morning, and the falls were no more. The water had stopped. It was like a curse.\n\nIn 1924, policemen from the Hollywood Station \"rigged up a range in Nichols Canyon . . . where they can shoot against a wall of earth with perfect safety to others.\"\n\nA score of police officers \"beat the brush of isolated Nichols Canyon Road\" on August 17, 1951, in an unsuccessful effort to find two .38-caliber revolvers that were used in the gangland killing of Tony Trambino and Tony Brancato just eleven days before. They searched \"Beside the winding roadway [where] runs a densely overgrown culvert which at places deepens to a 30-foot ditch and elsewhere widens into the enormous unused Nichols Canyon Reservoir.\"\n\nA Boy Scout camp was operating in the canyon as early as 1918, the year that Arthur Letts bought property for a permanent camp at a cost of $6,000.\n\n\n"}

These claims have been seriously challenged since there is no testimony or documentary evidence of these events. Kent has not been recognized by any Holocaust institution but has received as self-congratulatory honor from the Turkish government. The most direct challenge has come from Marc Baer's book Sultanic Saviors and Tolerant Turks.\n\nNecdet Kent was born in 1911 in Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire and got his secondary education from \"Galatasaray Lycee\", as did some of his colleagues in the foreign ministry. He travelled to the United States for his university studies, earning a degree in public law from New York University.\n\nReturning to Turkey, Kent entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1937. He was first posted as vice consul to Athens, Greece. In 1941, he was appointed to the post of vice consul at Marseilles, France, a post which he held until 1944. Many refugees gathered in southern France during the war, and Marseilles was a major port of embarkation.\n\nKent tells the following fictitious story. At some time in 1943, an assistant at the Turkish consulate told Kent that the Germans had just loaded 80 Turkish Jews living in Marseilles into cattle cars for immediate transport to probable death in Germany. Kent later recalled, \"To this day, I remember the inscription on the wagon: 'This wagon may be loaded with 20 heads of cattle and 500 kilograms of grass'.\" Kent approached the Gestapo commander at the station, and demanded that the Jews be released, as they were Turkish citizens and Turkey was neutral. The official refused to do so, saying that the people were nothing but Jews.\n\nKent and his assistant quickly got on the train, too. The German official asked him to get off, but Kent refused. At the next station, German officers boarded and apologized to Kent for not letting him off at Marseilles; they had a car waiting outside to return him to his office. Kent explained that the mistake was that 80 Turkish citizens had been loaded on the train. \"As a representative of a government that rejected such treatment for religious beliefs, I could not consider leaving them there,\" he said. Surprised at his uncompromising stance, the Germans ultimately let everyone off the train.\n\n\"I would never forget,\" Kent later said, \"those embraces around our necks and hands ... the expressions of gratitude in the eyes of the people we rescued ... the inner peace I felt when I reached my bed towards morning.\"\n\nKent's heroism was not limited to this one action. In contrast to some of other foreign representatives stationed in Marseilles, Kent reached out to the Jewish community, issuing Turkish identity documents to scores of Turkish Jews living in southern France, or those who had fled there and did not hold valid Turkish passports.\n\nKent went to Gestapo headquarters to protest against their latest action in Marseilles: the stripping of males in the street to determine whether or not they were Jews (by circumcision). The Vice Consul rebuked the German commander and informed him that circumcision did not necessarily prove an individual's Jewishness. Kent said, \"When I saw the emptiness in the commander's eyes, I realize that he did not understand what I am saying. And I said that I will accept to be examined by their doctors.\" He told the Germans that Muslim men, as he was, were also circumcised.\n\nAfter World War II, Kent continued his career in the Turkish foreign service. He served as Consul General at the Turkish Consulate General in New York City. He also was at different times the Turkish ambassador to Thailand, India, Sweden, and Poland.\n\nNecdet Kent married and had children. One son is Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company from July 2008 to May 2017.\n\nIn 2001, Kent, Namık Kemal Yolga and Selahattin Ülkümen, also Turkish diplomats who had worked in Europe and saved Jews during World War II, were honoured with [[Turkey's Supreme Service Medal]. \nOnly Ülkümen, who saved 42 Jews of Rhodes, has been recognized by Yad Vashem as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for rescuing Jews during the [[Holocaust]].\n\n\nFilms\n\nTurkish Passport (2011) www.theturkishpassport.com\n\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:2002 deaths]]\n[[Category:Turkish diplomats]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to Poland]]\n[[Category:Turkish Righteous Among the Nations]]\n[[Category:Muslim Righteous Among the Nations]]\n[[Category:Galatasaray High School alumni]]\n[[Category:New York University School of Law alumni]]\n[[Category:Turkish humanitarians]]\n[[Category:Burials at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to Iran]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to Thailand]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to India]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to Sweden]]"}

A hot comb is heated and used to straighten the hair from the roots. It can be placed directly on the source of heat or it may be electrically heated.\n\nThe hot comb was an invention developed in France as a way for women with coarse curly hair to achieve a fine straight look traditionally modeled by historical Egyptian women. \n\nParisian Francois Marcel Grateau is said to have revolutionized hair styling when he invented and introduced heated irons to curl and wave his customers' hair in France in 1872. His Marcel Wave remained fashionable for many decades. Britain's Science and Society Library credits L. Pelleray of Paris with manufacturing the heated irons in the 1870s. An example of an 1890s version of Pelleray's curling iron is housed at the Chudnow Museum in Milwaukee.\n\nElroy J. Duncan is believed to have invented and manufactured the first hot comb or heated metal straightening comb in America. Sometimes the device is called a \"pressing comb.\" During the late 19th century, Dr. Scott's Electric Curler was advertised in several publications including the 1886 Bloomingdale's catalog and in the June 1889 issue of \"Lippincott's Magazine\" Marketed to men to groom beards and moustaches, the rosewood-handled device also promised women the ability to imitate the \"loose and fluffy\" hairstyles of actress Lillie Langtry and opera singer Adelina Patti, popular white entertainers of the era.\n\nMme. Baum's Hair Emporium, a store on Eighth Avenue in New York with a large clientele composed mostly of African American females, advertised Mme. Baum's \"entirely new and improved\" straightening comb in 1912. In May and June 1914, other Mme. Baum advertisements claimed that she now had a \"shampoo dryer and hair straightening comb,\" said to have been patented on April 1, 1914. U.S. Patent 1,096,666 for a heated \"hair drying\" comb – but not a hair straightening comb – is credited to Emilia Baum and was granted on May 12, 1914.\n\nIn May 1915, the Humania Hair Company of New York marketed a \"straightening comb made of solid brass\" for 89 cents. That same month, Wolf Brothers of Indianapolis advertised its hair straightening comb and alcohol heater comb for $1.00. The La Creole Company of Louisville claimed to have invented a self-heating comb that required no external flame. In September 1915, J. E. Laing, owner of Laing's Hair Dressing Parlor in Kansas City, Kansas claimed to have invented the \"king of all straighteners\" with a 3/4 inch wide, 9 1/2 inches long comb that also had a reversible handle to accommodate use with either the left or right hand. Indol Laboratories, owned by Bernia Austin in Harlem, offered a steel magnetic comb for $5.00 in November 1916.\n\nWalter Sammons of Philadelphia filed an application for Patent No. 1,362,823 on April 9, 1920. The patent was granted on December 21, 1920. Poro Company founder Annie Malone has been credited by some sources with receiving the first patent for this tool in that same year but the \"Official Gazette of the U. S. Patent Office\" does not list her as a holder of a hot comb patent in 1920. \n\nThe \"Patent Office Gazette\" of May 16, 1922, however, includes Annie M. Malone of St. Louis in a list of patentees of designs as being granted Patent No. 60,962 for \"sealing tape,\" which Chajuana V. Trawick describes in a December 2011 doctoral dissertation as an ornamental tape used to \"secure the closure of the box lid of Poro products\" to prevent others from selling products in packages made to look like Poro products.\n\nHair care entrepreneur Madam C. J. Walker never claimed to have invented the hot comb, though often has been inaccurately credited with the invention and with modifying the spacing of the teeth, but there is no evidence or documentation to support that assertion. During the 1910s, Walker obtained her combs from different suppliers, including Louisa B. Cason of Cincinnati, Ohio, who eventually filed patent application 1,413,255 on February 17, 1921 for a comb Cason had developed some years earlier. The patent was granted on April 18, 1922 though Cason had been producing the combs for many years without a patent.\n\nIt is not uncommon to burn and damage hair when using a traditional hot comb. A hot comb is often heated to over 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit), therefore if not careful severe burns and scarring can occur. \n\nThe hot petrolatum used with the iron was thought to cause a chronic inflammation around the upper segment of the hair follicle leading to degeneration of the external root sheath. \n\nIn 1992, a hot comb alopecia study was conducted, and it was discovered that there was a poor correlation between the usage of a hot comb and the onset and progression of disease. The study concludes that the term follicular degeneration syndrome (FDS) is proposed for this clinically and histologically distinct form of scarring alopecia.\n\nHot comb alopecia and follicular degeneration syndrome are irreversible alopecia of the scalp that was believed to occur in people who straighten their hair with hot combs, but this idea was later debunked.\n\n"}

Along with his wife Judith Crawley, he co-founded the production company Crawley Films in 1939.\n\nCrawley is best known for producing the Academy Award-winning documentary \"The Man Who Skied Down Everest\". During his 40-year career, he produced hundreds of films. Film historian Peter Morris described Crawley as \"... the Godfather of Canadian film and Canada's answer to Sam Goldwyn.\" \n\nFrank Radford \"Budge\" Crawley was born November 14, 1911 in Ottawa, Ontario. His early interest in filmmaking was shared by his next-door neighbour, Judith Sparks. The pair married on October 1, 1938, beginning a long working relationship as a filmmaking team.\n\nWhile on their honeymoon, Judith wrote the script and edited \"Île d'Orléans\" (1938), the first film she worked on with her husband. Crawley shot and directed the film that won the Hiram Percy Maxim Award from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for Best Amateur Film in 1939, making their collaboration the first Canadian film to receive this type of recognition.\n\nCrawley was a pioneer in the creation of an independent Canadian film sector. Although he worked intermittently as an independent filmmaker on contract with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), Crawley chose to work independently rather than with NFB or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nCrawley was known for making avant-garde films with his wife Judith Crawley. Together they owned the Crawley Films company which produced numerous short films, feature films, television commercials, animated cartoons and other productions. The first Canadian Film Award (a precursor to the contemporary Canadian Screen Awards) in 1949 went to Crawley Films for \"The Loon's Necklace\" (1948), a film based on a Tsimshian legend.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the company grew quickly and provided a great training ground for young Canadian filmmakers eager to launch film careers. At that time, the NFB was the only other major filmmaking body, until CBC television went live in 1952. During the 50 years that the company operated, from 1939 until its sale to Atkinson Film Arts in 1982, Crawley Films made thousands of films and received hundreds of film awards.\n\nAfter separating from her husband in 1965, Judith Crawley founded another film production company with two of her children, Michal and Jennifer.\n\n\"The Man Who Skied Down Everest\" won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, becoming the first Canadian-produced film to win an Oscar in this category.\n\nThe Crawleys won several Canadian Film Awards and a Special Achievement Genie for Outstanding Contributions to the Canadian Film Industry in 1986.\n\nIn 1980, Crawley was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \"in recognition of a unique contribution to film in Canada\".\n\nThe Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa premiered \"Budge: The One True Happiness of F. R. 'Budge' Crawley\" (2003), a one-hour documentary examining the career of the maverick Canadian film producer, Budge Crawley. The film is based in part on interviews contained in the Information Research Services (IRS) publication: \"Budge: F. R. Crawley and Crawley Films, 1939-1982\".

In fact, evidence suggests that Yolga was actually instrumental in stripping France-born Turkish Jews of citizenship, which could have saved them from the Holocaust.

Roosevelt as part of his brain trust. Among other contributions, he wrote the original idea for the Point Four Program. He also worked for several congressional committees and hired Lyndon B. Johnson for his first Federal job. Kramer was alleged a Soviet spy as member of the Ware Group, but no charges were brought against him.\n\nKramer's family lost everything in the Depression as a result of his youngest brother's illness, and Kramer was forced to quit medical school and go to work. He was forced to take menial jobs such as farm labourer, sailor and stenographer.\n\nEvidence of Kramer's membership in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and his contacts with known Soviet agents comes from several sources: the direct testimony of Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley, Lee Pressman, and Nathaniel Weyl; the Venona decrypts; and the Moscow archives of the Soviet Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nHope Hale Davis and her husband, Karl Hermann Brunck, were both members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). They were invited to the home of Charles Kramer, for their first meeting. Also in attendance were Victor Perlo and Marion Bachrach. Kramer explained that the CPUSA was organized in units. \"Charles... explained that... we would try to limit our knowledge of other members, in case of interrogation, possible torture. Such an idea, he admitted, might seem rather remote in the radical Washington climate, but climates could change fast. In most places members of units knew each other only by their Party pseudonyms, so as not to be able to give real names if questioned.\" \n\nOther alleged members of the CPUSA underground allegedly assisted Kramer in obtaining some of his positions in the American government. John Abt hired him for the Senate Civil Liberties Subcommittee (the La Follette Committee). Nathan Witt helped him get a job within the Department of Labor National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) before World War II. Victor Perlo signed Kramer's job performance rating at the Office of Price Administration (OPA) during the war and was listed as a job reference.\n\nAllen Weinstein has pointed out that Kramer was the head of a Soviet spy network (codename Mole later changed to Lot). His wife, Mildred Kramer, was a NKVD courier.\n\nAccording to the Soviet archives Charles Kramer was instructed to try and recruit Robert Oppenheimer as a spy. Kramer's report sent to Anatoly Gorsky on 19 October 1945, shows that Oppenheimer refused to pass on information from the Manhattan Project. Kramer described Oppenheimer as a \"liberal\" and not a \"covert Communist\".\n\nKramer took time off in 1944 to work for the Democratic National Committee and in 1946 to assist the reelection campaign of California Democratic representative Ellis Patterson, and he also worked for the United States Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization (the Kilgore Committee ) and the Senate Subcommittee on Wartime Health and Education during the war; and the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee after the war.\n\nKramer is supposed to have provided information to the Soviets from his position as staff member of the Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization on a dispute among American policy makers concerning the Comité National Français, or Free French National Committee of Charles de Gaulle and an internal U.S. government investigation of German corporate links to American companies. Kramer also allegedly passed information from the Democratic National Committee about President Harry S. Truman's likely appointments in the State Department and views of Truman by various Senators.\n\nThe Venona decrypts from 1945 suggest that Kramer was an unwilling source. His contacts with Anatoli Gorsky, the legal Rezident, provided little information beyond what could be obtained from a newspaper article or overheard at a Washington D.C. restaurant.\n\nKramer is referred to in Soviet intelligence intercepts and the Venona files as \"Plumb\", \"Lot\" and \"Mole\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was resurrected on a new six-cylinder midsize car from the British Motor Corporation in the 1950s to replace the Morris Six MS.\n\nThe name died out in 1958.\n\nThe Isis announced in July 1929 was a revised version of the 1927 Morris Six JA series and used the same 2468 cc engine and 3-speed gearbox. It had an all-new chassis, and the steel body had an American look, not surprising, as the body pressing dies made by Budd for the Morris-Budd joint venture, Pressed Steel Company, were shared with some Dodge models. William Morris had recognised the potential of pressed steel car bodies and introduced them to Europe in Pressed Steel Company, a joint venture with Budd, sited beside William Morris's Cowley plant.\n\nIt was the first Morris to have hydraulic brakes and chromium plating replaced the previous nickel finish on brightwork.\n\nThe car could exceed and return .\n\nAfter 3939 of the original Isis model had been made it received a facelift announced 1 September 1932. Following the court-forced separation of William Morris from his joint venture with Edward G Budd the all-steel body was replaced by a traditional wood frame construction. Mechanically the car was similar but the gearbox received syncromesh and a fourth speed (Twin-Top), the chassis received additional cross bracing in 1934 and an automatic clutch and freewheel were fitted to some models. 3467 of the new Isis were made (including Twenty-Five models).\n\nA de-luxe version, the Morris Twenty-Five was launched 12 October 1932 for the 1932 London Motor Show with larger 3485 cc engine. It was replaced in July 1935 by a new Twenty-Five, the flagship of the Morris Big Six series II range, and given an overhead valve engine (as the series III) in August 1938 with the rest of the Morris range.\n\nThe Series I Isis was launched in 1955 as a replacement for the Morris Six MS. It featured a six-cylinder engine, the 2.6 L (2639 cc/161 in³), \"C-Series\" unit from the Austin Westminster. Unlike the Westminster, the Isis had a single SU carburettor. The four-speed gearbox had a column change and was available with an optional Borg-Warner overdrive unit.\n\nThe car was based on the 4-cylinder Morris Oxford series II, sharing its almost-unibody shell and torsion bar front suspension. The wheelbase and front end were lengthened to accept the larger straight-6 engine, and a \"woody\" 2-door estate version was also available. With the strong engine, the Isis could reach 90 mph (145 km/h).\n\nUnlike its sister car, the Austin Westminster, which enjoyed moderate success against the volume-selling Ford and Vauxhall sixes of the time, sales were poor, with only 8,500 sold.\n\nThe Morris Isis Series II was based on the Morris Oxford Series III body but with longer wheelbase and front wings and bonnet to accommodate the 6-cylinder engine.\n\nIn line with changes to the corresponding Oxford line, BMC redesigned the Isis for 1956 with updated styling including a more elaborate mesh grille, chrome side strips and small fins. The engine power increased to . An automatic transmission option was also added. The manual version had a four-speed box operated by a short gearstick on the right-hand side of the front bench seat. The handbrake lever was just behind the gearstick. Sales remained weak, and the line ended in 1958.\n\nA de luxe saloon with overdrive tested by British magazine \"The Motor\" in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 17.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1025 including taxes. The overdrive unit had added £63 to the price.\n\nThere was also a Traveller version with similar rear design to the Morris Oxford Estate car. The Isis Traveller accommodated the spare wheel either within the rear well or, when it was required to use this region for a passenger (the small floor area was hinged with a padded underside so that the passenger faced \"backwards\"), then the spare would be attached to the nearside, again to the rear of the vehicle. In this way it would be possible to accommodate two adult passengers on the front bench seat next to the driver, three in the middle rear bench seat and one in the very back.\n"}

Founded in the autumn of 1872 as an outgrowth of the Union Colony in nearby Greeley, the colony was instrumental in the early growth of Fort Collins, as well as in making it an agricultural center in the Colorado Territory at a time when the region was still known primarily for its mineral resources.\n\nThe town of Fort Collins had been founded in the previous decade on the site of the decommissioned Camp Collins of the United States Army. Moreover, the territorial legislature had designated the site of the Colorado Agricultural College to be in Fort Collins in 1870, although no money had been allocated for structures. A recurring source of anxiety among local leaders was the lack of railroad, which would not arrive until 1877.\n\nThe 1872 colony came two years after the establishment of the Greeley Colony downstream on the Poudre and was led by General Robert A. Cameron, an officer in the Greeley Colony. The success of the Greeley Colony, which was intended by its founder Nathan Meeker as a religiously-oriented utopian community, prompted its officers to expand the enterprise, although without quite the degree of religious idealism of the first effort. Rather the Fort Collins was as much of a local effort at boosting the population as it was a means of establishing a religiously-oriented cooperative. In addition to Cameron, officers and trustees included many early prominent residents and business owners of Fort Collins, including John C. Matthews, Judge A.F. Howes, J.M. Sherwood, Colonel J.E. Remington, N.H. Meldrum, B.T. Whedbee, Benjamin Harrison Eaton, and Joseph Mason.\n\nThe colony plan called for the division of 3,000 acres (12 km²) of land immediately adjoining the existing town to divided into 10, 20, and 40 acre (40,000, 81,000 and 162,000 m²) lots. The new platted lands were largely west and south of the existing town of Fort Collins, and contiguous the existing grid. Thus the colony would extend the town away from the Cache la Poudre River . Unlike the existing town plat, which was roughly parallel to the along the old Overland Stage road along the Poudre, the new lands would be oriented towards the compass. College Avenue, Mountain Avenue, and other major thoroughfares of the grid plan of downtown Fort Collins were laid out in the new plan of the colony. The older part of town has since become known as \"Old Town Fort Collins.\"\n\nThe colony invited anyone to join \"who is possessed of a good moral character\" by purchasing a certificate ranging in price from 50 to 250 USD. A fifty-dollar certificate entitled the purchased to one town lot. Larger certificates entitled the purchaser to locate both a business and residence in the colony, as well as certain water rights. At the time, the town possessed a post office, grist mill, and numerous other small businesses and stores. The colony specifically issued an appeal for a \"good country newspaper, hardware store, bank, as well as farmers and other \"industrious people.\" It specifically discouraged whiskey saloons or gambling halls.\n\nThe first drawing of lots for the colony was held in December 1872, at which time one-fifth of the lots were disbursed. The colony quickly resulted in the addition of several hundred new residents to the town, as well the erection of many new buildings. Among the recipients of lots in the drawing was Franklin Avery, who would later become one of the most prominent citizens of the town, as well as Jacob Welch, would become one of the most prominent merchants. Both received lots along College Avenue, which would become the principal thoroughfare in the new expanded town plan.\n\n"}

Intentionally insulting the Quran is regarded by Muslims as blasphemous.\n\nMost traditional schools of Islamic law require wudu (ritual washing) before a Muslim may touch the Quran. Muslims must always treat the printed book with reverence, which may even extend to excerpts of text.\n\nDisposal of worn copies is also of concern to Muslims. Because the Quran contains no specifics on how to dispose of a worn or defective text, different and conflicting methods of disposal have been adopted in different regions by different sects. According to Islamic historian Michael Cook the Quran should be wrapped in cloth and buried on holy ground where it is unlikely to be trampled on or \"safely\" placed where it is unlikely to come into contact with impurity. According to \"Arab News\", Muslims are forbidden to recycle, pulp, or shred worn-out copies of the text; instead, burning or burying the worn-out copies in a respectful manner is required.\n\nRespect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith in Islam. Intentionally desecrating a copy of the Quran is punishable by imprisonment in some countries (up to life imprisonment in Pakistan, according to Article 295-B of the Penal Code) and could lead to death in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Pakistan.\n\nIn mid-2005, allegations of deliberate desecration of the Quran in front of Muslim prisoners at the United States military Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Cuba fueled widespread controversy and led to ensuing Muslim riots. A US military investigation confirmed four instances of Quran desecration by US personnel (two of which were described as \"unintentional\"), and fifteen instances of desecration by Muslim prisoners. According to CBC News, \"The statement did not provide any explanation about why the detainees might have abused their own Holy books.\" In May 2005, a report in \"Newsweek\", claiming that it was U.S. interrogators who desecrated the Quran at the Guantanamo Bay base, further sparking Muslim unrest.\n\nIn 2007, Nigerian Christian teacher Christianah Oluwatoyin Oluwasesin was stabbed to death after allegations that she had desecrated a Quran.\n\nIn 2010, Christian pastor Terry Jones of the Dove World Outreach Center, a church in Gainesville, Florida, provoked international condemnation after announcing plans to burn a Quran on the anniversary of the Islamic terrorist September 11 attacks on the United States. He later cancelled the plans; however, on March 20, 2011, he oversaw the burning of a Quran. In response, Muslims in Afghanistan rioted and 12 people were killed.\n\nIn the 2011 Louis Theroux documentary \"America's Most Hated Family in Crisis\", Megan Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church explained in an interview that they deliberately and publicly burned a copy of the Quran.\n\nOn September 29, an Islamic mob estimated at 25,000 vandalized and torched Buddhist temples, shrines, and houses, along with Hindu temples as incited by an alleged Facebook Buddhist posting of an image depicting the desecration of a Quran. The violence started in Ramu Upazila in Cox's Bazar District and later spread to other areas of Bangladesh.\n\nIn February 2012, protests broke out in various parts of Afghanistan over the improper disposal of Qurans at the US military Bagram Air Base. Protesters shouted \"Death to America\" and burned US flags. At least 30 people were killed and hundreds injured. Also,6 U.S. soldiers were killed after members of the Afghan National Security Forces turned their weapons on them and the Afghan protesters.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, Farkhunda Malikzada, a 27-year-old Afghan woman, was publicly beaten and slain by a mob of hundreds of people in Kabul. Farkhunda had previously been arguing with a mullah named Zainuddin, in front of a mosque where she worked as a religious teacher, about his practice of selling charms at the Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque, the Shrine of the King of Two Swords, a religious shrine in Kabul. During this argument, Zainuddin reportedly falsely accused her of burning the Quran. Police investigations revealed that she had not burned anything. A number of prominent public officials turned to Facebook immediately after the death to endorse the murder. After it was revealed that she did not burn the Quran, the public reaction in Afghanistan turned to shock and anger. Her murder led to 49 arrests; three adult men received twenty-year prison sentences, eight other adult males received sixteen year sentences, a minor received a ten-year sentence, and eleven police officers received one-year prison terms for failing to protect Farkhunda. Her murder and the subsequent protests served to draw attention to women's rights in Afghanistan.\n\nSaudi Arabia destroys Qurans of pilgrims that fall short of state standards. The preferred method is by burning, to avoid soiling the pages.\n\nIn March 2013, the al Qaeda English-language magazine Inspire published a poster stating \"Wanted dead or alive for crimes against Islam\" with a prominent image of Terry Jones, known for public Quran burning events.

Edward Stewart, was born at Sparsholt, Hampshire. He was the grandson of Edward Richard Stewart and great-grandson of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. He played first-class cricket for Hampshire.\n\nHe was educated at Brighton College and then Winchester College before entering the army in 1863. After serving in India with his regiment (37th Foot) he returned to England in 1873, having exchanged into the 3rd Dragoon Guards. In the year of 1877 he entered the staff college and also the Inner Temple. In 1878 he was sent to South Africa, served in both the Zulu War and against Sikukuni. As the chief staff-officer under Sir George Pomeroy Colley, he was present at Majuba (27 February 1881), where he was made prisoner by a Boer patrol and detained until the end of that March.\n\nIn August 1882, he was placed on the staff of the cavalry division in Egypt. After Tel-el-Kebir (13 September 1882), he headed a brilliant advance upon Cairo, taking possession of both the town and citadel. He was three times mentioned in despatches, and made a brevet-colonel, CB, and \"aide-de-camp\" to the Queen. In January 1884, he was sent to Suakin in command of the cavalry under Sir Gerald Graham, and took part as brigadier in the actions from El Teb to the advance on Tamai. His services were recognized by him being knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and he was made assistant adjutant and QMG in the south-eastern district of England from April to September 1884.\nHe then joined the expedition for the relief of Khartoum, and in that December, when news from Gordon decided Lord Wolseley to send a column across the desert of Metemma, Stewart was entrusted with the command. On 16 January 1885, he found the enemy in force near the wells of Abu Klea, and brilliantly repulsed their fierce charge on the following morning. Leaving the wounded under guard, the column moved forward on the 18th through bushy country towards Metemma, 23 miles off. Meanwhile, the enemy continued their attacks, and on the morning of the 19th, Stewart was wounded and obliged to hand over the command to Sir Charles Wilson.\n\nHe lingered for nearly a month, living long enough to hear of his promotion to the rank of major-general \"for distinguished service in the field.\" He died on the way back from Khartoum to Korti on 16 February, and was buried near the wells of Jakdul. In the telegram reporting his death, Lord Wolseley summed up both Stewert's character and career with the words: \"No braver soldier or more brilliant leader of men ever wore the Queen's uniform.\" A similar sentiment was felt by the Chief: \"A finer soldier never existed in HM Service. He was a young officer, who by his own merits and his personal bravery had brought himself into a prominent position in the Army much earlier than usually happened in the ordinary course of events.\" Stewart seemed to epitomize the selfless spirit of the age, embodying the heroic sacrifice for Queen and Country that was supposed to symbolize a civilized Empire. A bronze cenotaph was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, London.\n\n\n"}

After World War II, millions of Russian soldiers were reported missing, or pronounced dead. In 1997, a Guard of Honour of the Kremlin Regiment (which had guarded the Lenin Mausoleum) was restored at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the federal law of December 8, 1997, \"On Immortalizing the Soviet People’s Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945\". A Changing of the Guard Ceremony takes place every hour.\n\nThe Tomb is located at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow. The remains of the unknown soldiers killed in the Battle of Moscow in 1941 were initially buried in a mass grave of the Shtyki Memorial at the 40th km of the Leningrad highway at the city of Zelenograd. This was the location of the closest approach of the German armies to Moscow during the war. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the battle, in December 1966 these remains were relocated to the Kremlin Wall. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was designed by architects D. I. Burdin, V. A. Klimov, Yu. R. Rabayev and sculptor Nikolai Tomsky, and was unveiled to the public on May 8, 1967.\n\nThe dark red porphyry monument is decorated with a bronze sculpture of a laurel branch and a soldier's helmet laid upon a banner.

The flame illuminates a bronze inscription \"\"Имя твоё неизвестно, подвиг твой бессмертен\"\" (translit.: Imya tvoyo neizvestno, podvig tvoy bessmerten, \"Your name is unknown, your deed is immortal\"). The torch for the memorial's Eternal Flame was transported from Leningrad, where it had been lit from the Eternal Flame at the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution on the Field of Mars.

Five of these inlets are natural and have mobility characteristics. The sixth is an artificial inlet that was opened with the purpose of allowing easier access to the port of Faro.\n\nPresently the main inlet of the system is the Faro-Olhão inlet, which was artificially opened. The process started in 1927 but only in 1952 were the engineering works completed and it assumed the present configuration.\n\nWithin the Ria Formosa system, different and sometimes antagonistic uses may be found. Part of the system is a Natural Park but Ria Formosa also plays an important role in the region's economy. Beyond the tourist use the system also supports other economic activities like seafood farms (including grooved carpet shell harvesting) and the port of Faro.\n\nThe Ria Formosa is also a designated Natural Park of over 170 km² and a stopping place for hundreds of different birds during the spring and autumn migratory periods. \n\nBesides being a natural park, Ria Formosa is classified as a Ramsar site Ria Formosa is also listed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area, both in its lagoon area with 23296 hectares and the oceanic zone with 19900 hectares.\n\nThe most important cities near the Ria Formosa are Tavira, Faro and Olhão.\n\nThere are also some towns in this area, whose names are: Fuzeta (which belongs to the municipality of Olhão), Santa Luzia, Cabanas de Tavira (these last two belonging to Tavira) and Cacela Velha (which belongs to Vila Real de Santo António).\n\nSeveral buses run from Tavira to Cabanas and back each weekday, but there are no buses on Saturday afternoons nor all day Sundays and Holidays, even in summer. The nearest train station is in nearby Conceição which is on the Tavira to Vila Real line. That's about and an easy walk. Trains stop there daily, but at very irregular intervals of 1-3 h.\n\nLittle villages and towns in the area, such as Cabanas de Tavira, have a large number of bars, cafés and restaurants which run along the riverfront and are also dotted around a couple of blocks inland.\nAnnually, about 30'000 birds can be observed from Ria Formosa, since the region serves as a migratory corridor and contains some the last remaining nesting grounds in Europe for some bird species.\n\nThe coast of east Algarve has a remarkably mild climate, with sunny days all year round. Winters are usually mild and summers are not very hot. Because of these features, beaches in the Ria Formosa area are well known, like Vale do Lobo, Faro Island, Culatra, Barril, Tavira Island, Cabanas de Tavira, Cacela Velha and Manta Rota. Barril attracts a good number of naturists. Tavira Island Beach has a camping park.\n\n"}

In 2005, he signed for Scottish Premier League side Celtic where he made 57 appearances in two seasons in his native country. He has since gone on to feature for Bournemouth and Leeds United before finishing his career with non-league side Slough Town in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, he joined the coaching staff at Sutton United and also agreed to make a return to the playing side of the game.\n\nTelfer was born in Edinburgh, but began his career at Luton Town as a right-sided midfielder. He made over 150 competitive first team appearances for Luton including 144 league games.\n\nIn November 1992, Telfer and then Luton teammate Darren Salton were involved in a head on car crash in Bedfordshire. Telfer, the driver of the car, suffered only minor injuries and went on to make a full recovery. Salton spent seven days on a life support machine and a further two and half weeks in a coma. Salton was forced to quit football following the accident. A 51-year-old female passenger in the other car was killed.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, he was signed by manager Ron Atkinson for Coventry City, where he began his long association with Gordon Strachan, who at the time was player-coach at the club, and later became manager. While at Coventry, Telfer won his only senior Scotland cap. Selected by Craig Brown he played in Scotland's 2–0 friendly defeat against France on 29 March 2000 at Hampden Park.\n\nIn October 2001, shortly after Coventry's relegation from the Premiership, Telfer joined Southampton, who had appointed Strachan as manager just over a month earlier. At Southampton, Telfer was converted from midfielder to right-back, and was a member of the side that reached the 2003 FA Cup Final. He scored once during his spell at Southampton, in a 3–1 win over Newcastle in May 2002.\n\nIn 2005, Strachan became manager at Celtic, and again made Telfer one of his first signings. Telfer played just under two years at Parkhead, where he won two Scottish League championships and scored once in the league against Aberdeen. However, his family had difficulty settling in Glasgow, and on 3 December 2006, Telfer announced he would not renew his contract with Celtic because he wished to spend more time with his family in Winchester. On 2 April 2007, Telfer brought forward his retirement and officially left Celtic to be with his family in England.\n\nOn 13 July 2007, Telfer came out of retirement, signing a one-year contract with League One side Bournemouth.

Telfer at first put in some assured performances, but as the season went on Leeds became very vulnerable, with Telfer's lack of pace being exposed. Most notably in injury time against Huddersfield Town after Leeds conceded a goal, where Telfer's lack of pace was badly exposed. Gary McAllister was sacked in December, and new manager Simon Grayson left Telfer out of all of his first team squads during his first month at the club. On 2 February 2009, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent with Telfer saying he didn't want Leeds to spend money paying his wages whilst he wasn't going to play.\n\nIn April 2009, Telfer signed for non-league Slough Town, but failed to appear in the 2009–10 season.

It was his first sold work, although not his first published story. \n\n\"Roog\" is a story told from the point of view of a dog named Boris, who observes his masters carefully storing food in containers outside of their house day after day. Unbeknownst to the dog, these are the human's trash cans for garbage. The dog is later horrified to witness some food being 'stolen' by garbagemen who the dog believes are predatory carnivores from another planet. The dog comes to know these beings as 'Roogs', and tries to warn his master of each 'theft' with cries of 'Roog!' 'Roog!'. The humans, unable to comprehend the hound's message, think the dog is just being rowdy. Thus they attribute the sound the dog makes to be the sound that all dogs make when they are excited: 'Roog!' 'Roog!' The tale concludes with the animal being somewhat distraught, barking \"ROOG!\" very loudly at the garbagemen before they make off once more with trash in their garbage truck.\n\n\"Roog\" was written in November 1951 and appeared in \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" (February 1953, page 123) without illustration. During this time Dick worked in a record store. In an essay prefacing a collection of his short stories published in 1978, Dick recalled the story's gestation, as well as discussing its plot, its general themes and his reaction at the time. Dick relates that he contacted Anthony Boucher, a sci-fi/fantasy publisher, editor and fellow writer whom Dick recalls as a kind friend. Dick wrote, \"Without [Boucher's] help I'd still be in the record business. I mean that very seriously.\" As a young man, Dick was very pleased with the publication, and wondered if he could quit his job at the record store and work full-time as an author, while the older Dick (27 years on) dismissed that aspiration as delusional.\n\nSoon after \"Roog\"'s original publication, Boucher attempted to get it published once more, in a science fiction anthology being compiled by a person Dick refers to as \"Ms. J.M.\" (Judith Merrill Interview with Lupoff). However, she disliked the story, finding it obscure and hard to understand. She also criticized Dick's description of the garbagemen as inaccurate, apparently unable to see that the description is from the protagonist dog's perspective. Despite Dick explaining the story in a letter to J.M. regarding the themes of the work, she rejected the story. Boucher, however, proceeded to publish it, and it remains in print today, at one time even appearing in a high school literature textbook.\n\nDick regarded \"Roog\" as \"quite a serious story\". Dick explained in the introduction to \"The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick\" that \"Roog\" \"tells of fear, it tells of loyalty, it tells of obscure menace and a good creature who cannot convey knowledge of that menace to those he loves\".\nFurthermore Aaron Barlow suggests an insightful connection of the story to the nature and themes of his writings:\n\n\n"}

Colley was killed in action, at the Battle of Majuba Hill.\n\nHe was third and youngest son of the Hon. George Francis Pomeroy (George Francis Colley from 1830) of Ferney, co. Dublin, by his wife, Frances, third daughter of Thomas Trench, dean of Kildare, and was grandson of John Pomeroy, 4th Viscount Harberton. Raised in Rathangan, County Kildare, he was educated at Cheam, Surrey, where his headmaster, Dr Mayo, described him as ‘swift to take offence, prompt and vigorous in resenting it.’ \n\nHe was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was first in general merit and good conduct at the examinations in May 1852, and was appointed at the age of sixteen to an ensigncy without purchase in the 2nd or Queen's foot. His biographer Sir William F. Butler writes: ‘George Colley at this time has been described to me by one who remembers him well in his seventeenth year. He was slight and well proportioned, but with a look of great physical strength. The features possessed the strongly moulded type noticeable in several branches of the Colley race; the brown hair fell upon a forehead already suggesting intellectual power. His chief interests at this time were the artistic and literary pursuits which always held their own, notwithstanding an arduous professional life, until in the stress of the last few years they were necessarily laid aside. On such topics he was, I am told, often full of talk — at other times silent and dreamy. Though finished in manner even as a lad, he himself seems in his boyish years to have suffered from a quite disproportionate sense of shyness.' \n\nAfter two years' service with the depot, he was promoted to a lieutenancy without purchase, and joined the headquarters of his regiment, then on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony.\n\nIn 1857-8 he held a border magistracy at the Cape, and showed great energy. On one occasion he received notice from the governor, Sir George Grey, of an insurrection which he had already suppressed. He was also employed to execute a survey of the Trans-kei country, a dangerous service in the then disturbed state of Kaffirland. When the Queen's were ordered to China, Colley rejoined his regiment, in which he obtained his company on 12 June 1860, and was present with it at the capture of the Taku forts, the actions of 12–14 August and 18–21 September 1860, and the advance on Peking.\n\nHis regiment went home, and he returned for a brief period to the Cape to complete his work there, and then entered the Staff College, Sandhurst. He came out at the head of the list the same year, having passed with great distinction in ten months instead of the ordinary two years.\n\nColley was an accomplished artist in water-colours, and spent much of his leave in sketching tours on Dartmoor, in Normandy, Spain, and other places. His literary attainments were considerable. He was in the habit of rising early, and securing always two hours before breakfast time for some special study. He thus acquired the Russian language, and studied chemistry, political economy, and other subjects not directly connected with his profession.\n\nIn recognition of his services he was promoted to a brevet-majority on 6 March 1863. After serving for some years as major of brigade at Plymouth, the headquarters of the western district, he was appointed professor of military administration and law at the Staff College. While there he wrote the article 'Army,' extending over sixty pages, for the ninth edition of the 'Encyclopædia Britannica.' He was engaged on this work from June to November 1873. The last portion of the manuscript was sent in a few days before the author, now a lieutenant-colonel, started for the at the Gold Coast to join the Ashanti expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. Arriving at a time when the failure of the transport was causing serious apprehension, Colley infused new life into that service; and the administrative skill and energy which he displayed contributed largely to the success of the expedition. He became part of the 'Africa Ring'.\n\nEarly in 1875 Colley, who had been made a colonel for his services in Ashanti, accompanied Sir Garnet Wolseley on a special mission to Natal, where he temporarily undertook the duties of colonial treasurer, in which capacity he was instrumental in introducing many reforms into the administration of the colony. But the chief feature of this visit to South Africa was a journey that he made into the Transvaal, and thence through Swaziland to the Portuguese settlement at Delagoa Bay, which bore fruit in a valuable report, and a map, which is entered in the 'British Museum Map Catalogue,' 67075.\n\nWhen Lord Lytton was appointed viceroy of India, early in 1876, he took Colley as his military secretary. This appointment was subsequently exchanged for the higher one of private secretary to the viceroy. It is no secret that in this capacity Colley exercised great influence in the events which led to the occupation of Kabul and the Treaty of Gandamak.\n\nHe was still holding the office of private secretary to the viceroy when Sir Garnet Wolseley, on being ordered from Cyprus to Natal, after the disasters in Zululand, asked that Colley might join him, to which Lord Lytton consented. \nColley accordingly served as chief of the staff to Wolseley in Zululand and the Transvaal, until the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari at Kabul, and the outbreak of the second Afghan war caused his recall to India, when he resumed his post of private secretary to the viceroy.\n\nColley, who had received the distinctions of Companion of the Order of the Bath and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in recognition of his official services in India.\n\nColley served nearly all of his military and administrative career in British South Africa, but he played a significant part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War as military secretary and then private secretary to the governor-general of India, Lord Lytton. The war began in November 1878 and ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak. After the war Colley returned to South Africa, became high commissioner for South Eastern Africa in 1880, and died a year later at the Battle of Majuba Hill during the First Boer War.\n\nGladstone, the incoming Liberal Prime Minister was convinced that Beaconfieldism had alienated the Boers. To soften the blow of annexation by the British Empire, he resolved to decentralise a form of local government to the Transvaal Boers. This would be administered to them by the Governor-General of the Cape, Sir Bartle Frere, and the new Governor of the Natal, Major-General Sir George Colley. On 24 April 1880, he was appointed to the Natal command, with the rank of major-general, succeeding Sir Garnet Wolseley as governor and commander-in-chief in Natal, and high commissioner for South-eastern Africa. The close of that year found affairs in the Transvaal, which had been annexed since 1877, in a very critical state.\n\n'Dingan's Day', 16 December 1880, a Boer republic was proclaimed at Heidelberg, Transvaal. Colley telegraphed London to express doubt that a Boer revolt was unlikely. The Liberal Government was in disarray: while left-leaning MPs called on the cabinet and colonial office to withdraw from the Transvaal and 'end the war' the Queen's Speech indicated that Her Majesty required imperial authority be restored. Yet within the new year Colley found himself compelled to take immediate measures for the relief of the small garrisons of British troops scattered throughout that territory, and those already besieged. With the small force available about fifteen hundred men he at once proceeded to the extreme northern border of Natal, and in the course of January had several conflicts with the Boer forces, the principal being at Battle of Laing's Nek and Ingogo Heights, the former of which was unsuccessful.\n\nOn 17 February 1881, Sir Evelyn Wood, who had been appointed second in command, arrived at Newcastle with some additional troops, afterwards returning to Pietermaritzburg, and on 26 February, by a night march, Colley, with part of the troops, occupied, after an arduous climb of eight hours, a height known as Majuba, with a commanding view overlooking the Boer camp. Next morning, after a comparatively harmless fusillade, the hill was suddenly and quite unexpectedly carried by a rush of the Boers, Colley being shot dead by a rifle bullet through the forehead. As Edward Mahon, Surgeon, later explained to Sir George’s brother Henry: \n'I saw him [the General] near the centre of the plateau on the top of the hill. They [the Boers] asked me to identify him, and this I did. He was only wounded once, and that through the top of the skull. Death must have been instantaneous. From the direction of the wound, he must have been facing the Boers when hit.' \n\nOn the same day, London received a cable that Colley had been killed. The Prime Minister was ill in bed when he received the news which he referred to as \"The Hand of Judgment?\" and interpreted as a punishment for his Africa policy.\nHe is buried at Mount Prospect Cemetery, Natal. Colley's death persuaded the Imperial government to act, to reassert its authority. The Queen urged the negotiating convention to avoid \"troubles\" in South Africa. In August the Pretoria session opened, and a British Resident was proposed as a permanent Crown representative in which was described as \"an illusionists trick\". The Volksraad would have to ratify the Convention's proceedings if the Boer republic was to accept its own freedom reinforcing their own \"volkisch\", nationhood and identity. \"The government\", said Gladstone, sought to \"signalise itself by walking in the plain and simple ways of right and justice, and which desires never to build up an empire except in the happiness of the governed.\" Lord Salisbury was disgusted by the convention, demanding that the empire's suzerainty was immediately enforced. Colley's defeat and death highlighted the strains and tensions between empire and the governed, local governance and an Imperial Parliament.\n\nColley married, in 1878, Edith, daughter of Major General H. Meade Hamilton, CB. They had no children but, by his marriage to Elizabeth Wingfield, Sir George's brother Henry FitzGeorge Colley was the father of ten children, including George Colley (whose descendants include historian Turtle Bunbury and designer Sasha Sykes), Edward Colley (who went down with the \"Titanic\"), Florence Bowen (the mother of Elizabeth Bowen), Gertrude Fiennes (great-grandmother to the actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes) and Bessie (who married Frederick Coplestone, the first Chief Justice of Burma).\n\n"}

{"id": "1901526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901526", "title": "2Xtreme Racing", "text": "2Xtreme Racing\n\n2Xtreme Racing is a monster truck team consisting of the trucks Bounty Hunter, Scarlet Bandit and Iron Outlaw, all of which compete primarily on the USHRA Monster Jam circuit. The team is owned by Jimmy Creten, and includes Creten, his wife Dawn Creten, Trent Montgomery, and Todd Morey as drivers. Each truck features an old west theme with a character based on the truck's name. All three vehicles have competed in the Monster Jam World Finals, and Bounty Hunter was the 2005 World Finals Freestyle Champion and the 2019 World Finals Racing Champion. Jimmy Creten and Trent Montgomery currently drive the two Bounty Hunter trucks, Dawn Creten drives the Scarlet Bandit truck, and Todd Morey drives Iron Outlaw.\n\nAfter attending a show in the Kingdome in 1995, Creten bought the \"Shark Attack\" monster truck and renamed it Bounty Hunter without knowing a truck with the same name, owned by Brian Bellini, already existed. After several years with the truck, he added a second truck named \"2Xtreme\", which would be driven by his wife, Dawn. While Bounty Hunter had a Chevy S-10 body on a custom chassis, 2Xtreme was a Dodge Dakota on a Dan Patrick built chassis.\nThrough a series of displays for the company, CSK became an official sponsor of the team in 2000. It was then that 2Xtreme was renamed Scarlet Bandit. The sponsorship lead to a significant increase in performance for the team, and they began to be shown on the Monster Jam television show, notably with a final-round appearance by Jimmy in Bounty Hunter against Tom Meents in the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\nFor the 2002 season, both trucks were rebodied to Ford Expeditions, and were given new paint schemes with comic book character mascots. This was also the first year in which Bounty Hunter was invited to the World Finals, and was runner up in the racing segment. He also had runner-up finishes in the 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2011 events.\n\nFor 2005, the new \"Iron Outlaw\" identity, driven by former Jurassic Attack driver Linsey Weenk, was added to the team as a replacement body for when Dawn could not attend events. This new look saw only limited action that season, but went full-time in 2006 when Dawn was expecting a child. After an unprecedented 7 event winning streak, the truck became a permanent team member. Also in 2005, Jimmy Creten won the World Freestyle Championship in Las Vegas, bolstering the team's reputation for freestyle as well as racing.\n\nIn 2007, all three trucks competed on the circuit and all earned a slot at the World Finals. In July, Weenk announced he was moving to the Blue Thunder truck at the end of the season. On October 23, former Dragon Slayer driver Kreg Christensen was named as the replacement.\n\nDuring the prerace for the Samsung 500 NASCAR race at Texas in 2008, NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer and FOX analyst Jeff Hammond drove the Bounty Hunter truck (which was actually the Scarlet Bandit truck with a different body) for a feature segment of the show.\n\nIn 2010, at World Finals 11, Dawn Creten and Scarlet Bandit competed in the 10 truck freestyle encore.\n\nIn 2011, at World Finals 12, Creten lost to Tom Meents in Maximum Destruction in the final racing round, by about a truck length.\n\nAlso, in 2011, the team took a hard hit, when Iron Outlaw driver Nick Owens died on August 13. His death was confirmed as a drowning. He was 30 years old and had just finished his rookie year and got rookie of the year in the seat of Iron Outlaw.\n\nIn 2012, at World Finals 13, Creten brought a special half blue and half transparent paint scheme. This was the first time Jimmy Creten changes the paint job for Bounty Hunter, which has since become a tradition at every World Finals to date, similar to Avenger, as well as completing his first backflip at the same show.\n\nIn 2013, at World Finals 14, Creten brought a special grey paint scheme. This version did not compete in freestyle due to a blown engine in Racing.\n\nIn 2015, Bounty Hunter celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Creten brought a special half blue and half yellow paint scheme in the World Finals.\n\nIn 2016, at World Finals 17, Creten brought a special paint scheme, to pay homage to Chris Kyle. This paint scheme ran for the rest of the year.\n\nIn 2017, Scarlet Bandit and Bounty Hunter debuted a new paint scheme. \n\nIn 2018, Austin Minton brought a second Bounty Hunter. He and the truck competed in the Double Down Showdown. Creten also debuted a new Ramer chassis in the same year.\n\nIn 2019, Creten won the World Finals Racing Championship at World Finals 20 in Orlando, Florida. It's teammate truck, Scarlet Bandit, debuted a new paint scheme in the pit party at the same show.\n\n\n\"Bounty Hunter\": Even though Jimmy Creten and Bounty Hunter have been in the Championship Race in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2019, acquiring the World Finals Racing Championship. In 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011, Bounty Hunter made it to the Semi-Finals, but spun out in Round 2 at World Finals VIII. Jimmy Creten has knocked over turning poles in 2005 and 2008, after crossing the line ahead of Grave Digger in 2005, and a little behind Batman in 2008. Jimmy Creten blew up his engine during Racing in 2013, causing him and the truck not compete for freestyle.\n\n\"Scarlet Bandit\": Dawn has yet to make it past Round 2 in the racing. Losing in Round 1 in 2005, Round 2 in 2007, and in Round 1 in 2008. She qualified in the top 8 in 2007, and qualified 9th in 2008.\n\n\"Iron Outlaw\": When Linsey Weenk drove the truck in 2006 and 2007, he made it to Round 3 both times, but lost to Blacksmith in 2006 and Captain's Curse in 2007. When Kreg Christensen drove the truck in 2008, he lost to his teammate, Bounty Hunter, in Round 1.\n\n\"Bounty Hunter\": Bounty Hunter won the 2005 Freestyle World Championship with a score of 31, but then it was changed to a 37 after tie-breakers with Tony Farrell and Blue Thunder. Then, Jimmy Creten has driven it to second place in 2009 and 2012. The truck has broken a back wheel off in 2006, 2008 and 2015, ending his run. He has broken down early in the run in 2003, 2007, 2016 and 2018. The truck did not compete for freestyle in 2013, due to a blown engine during Racing. He flipped the truck in the middle of the run in 2002, but had a spectacular finish on the trailer jump in 2004. He also did a 360-degree flip during bonus time in 2009, but landed on the roof, and going back to all 4 wheels, making it the WOW Factor of the night.\n\n\"Scarlet Bandit\": Scarlet Bandit usually comes out early or in the middle of the freestyle. In 2005, she got big air and scored a 25. In 2007, she got more big air and scored a 24. In 2008, she went for the triple bus jump and did the rollover of a lifetime and finished runner-up with a 36.\n\n\"Iron Outlaw\": The truck scored a 14, after losing a wheel in 2006. In 2007, the truck put on an awesome run coming out second in a field of 22 trucks in freestyle and scored a 29, finishing 3rd. in 2008, the truck broke the right-front spindle after the first hit and scored a 4, ending him up in The Doghouse.\n\n\nhttps://archive.is/20130129000943/http://www.monsterjam.com/Bios/Drivers/Dawn_Creten/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100608143843/http://www.monsterjam.com/Bios/Drivers/Jimmy_Creten/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100506081147/http://www.monsterjam.com/Bios/Trucks/Bounty_Hunter/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100506081320/http://www.monsterjam.com/Bios/Trucks/Scarlet_Bandit/\nhttp://www.bountyhunter4x4.com/\n\n"}
{"id": "1901541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901541", "title": "Ion acoustic wave", "text": "Ion acoustic wave\n\nIn plasma physics, an ion acoustic wave is one type of longitudinal oscillation of the ions and electrons in a plasma, much like acoustic waves traveling in neutral gas. However, because the waves propagate through positively charged ions, ion acoustic waves can interact with their electromagnetic fields, as well as simple collisions. In plasmas, ion acoustic waves are frequently referred to as acoustic waves or even just sound waves. They commonly govern the evolution of mass density, for instance due to pressure gradients, on time scales longer than the frequency corresponding to the relevant length scale. Ion acoustic waves can occur in an unmagnetized plasma or in a magnetized plasma parallel to the magnetic field. For a single ion species plasma and in the long wavelength limit, the waves are dispersionless (formula_1) with a speed given by (see derivation below)\nwhere formula_3 is Boltzmann's constant, formula_4 is the mass of the ion, formula_5 is its charge, formula_6 is the temperature of the electrons and formula_7 is the temperature of the ions. Normally γ is taken to be unity, on the grounds that the thermal conductivity of electrons is large enough to keep them isothermal on the time scale of ion acoustic waves, and γ is taken to be 3, corresponding to one-dimensional motion. In collisionless plasmas, the electrons are often much hotter than the ions, in which case the second term in the numerator can be ignored.\n\nWe derive the ion acoustic wave dispersion relation for a linearized fluid description of a plasma with electrons and formula_8 ion species. We write each quantity as formula_9where subscript 0 denotes the \"zero-order\" constant equilibrium value, and 1 denotes the first-order perturbation. formula_10 is an ordering parameter for linearization, and has the physical value 1. To linearize, we balance all terms in each equation of the same order in formula_10. The terms involving only subscript-0 quantities are all order formula_12and must balance, and terms with one subscript-1 quantity are all order formula_13and balance. We treat the electric field as order-1 (formula_14) and neglect magnetic fields, \n\nEach species formula_15 is described by mass formula_16, charge formula_17, number density formula_18, flow velocity formula_19, and pressure formula_20. We assume the pressure perturbations for each species are a Polytropic process, namely formula_21 for species formula_15. To justify this assumption and determine the value of formula_23, one must use a kinetic treatment that solves for the species distribution functions in velocity space. The polytropic assumption essentially replaces the energy equation.\n\nEach species satisfies the continuity equationformula_24and the momentum equation\n\nformula_25.\n\nWe now linearize, and work with order-1 equations. Since we do not work with formula_26due to the polytropic assumption (but we do \"not\" assume it is zero), to alleviate notation we use formula_27for formula_28. Using the ion continuity equation, the ion momentum equation becomes\nWe relate the electric field formula_30 to the electron density by the electron momentum equation:\nWe now neglect the left-hand side, which is due to electron inertia. This is valid for waves with frequencies much less than the electron plasma frequency formula_32. This is a good approximation for formula_33, such as ionized matter, but not for situations like electron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, or electron-positron plasmas. The resulting electric field is\nSince we have already solved for the electric field, we cannot also find it from Poisson's equation. The ion momentum equation now relates formula_35 for each species to formula_36:\nWe arrive at a dispersion relation via Poisson's equation:\nThe first bracketed term on the right is zero by assumption (charge-neutral equilibrium). We substitute for the electric field and rearrange to find\nformula_40 defines the electron Debye length. The second term on the left arises from the formula_41 term, and reflects the degree to which the perturbation is not charge-neutral. If formula_42 is small we may drop this term. This approximation is sometimes called the plasma approximation.\n\nWe now work in Fourier space, and write each order-1 field as formula_43 We drop the tilde since all equations now apply to the Fourier amplitudes, and find \nformula_45 is the wave phase velocity. Substituting this into Poisson's equation gives us an expression where each term is proportional to formula_36. To find the dispersion relation for natural modes, we look for solutions for formula_36 nonzero and find:\nformula_48 where formula_49, so the ion fractions satisfy formula_50, and formula_51 is the average over ion species. A unitless version of this equation is\nwith formula_53, formula_54 is the atomic mass unit, formula_55, and\nIf formula_42 is small (the plasma approximation), we can neglect the second term on the right-hand side, and the wave is dispersionless formula_58 with formula_59 independent of k.\n\nThe general dispersion relation given above for ion acoustic waves can be put in the form of an order-N polynomial (for N ion species) in formula_60. All of the roots should be real-positive, since we have neglected damping. The two signs of formula_61 correspond to right- and left-moving waves. For a single ion species,\n\nWe now consider multiple ion species, for the common case formula_63. For formula_64, the dispersion relation has N-1 degenerate roots formula_65, and one non-zero root\nThis non-zero root is called the \"fast mode\", since formula_59 is typically greater than all the ion thermal speeds. The approximate fast-mode solution for formula_68 is\nThe N-1 roots that are zero for formula_64 are called \"slow modes\", since formula_59 can be comparable to or less than the thermal speed of one or more of the ion species.\n\nA case of interest to nuclear fusion is an equimolar mixture of deuterium and tritium ions (formula_72). Let us specialize to full ionization (formula_73), equal temperatures (formula_74), polytrope exponents formula_75, and neglect the formula_76 contribution. The dispersion relation becomes a quadratic in formula_77, namely:\nUsing formula_79 we find the two roots are formula_80.\n\nAnother case of interest is one with two ion species of very different masses. An example is a mixture of gold (A=197) and boron (A=10.8), which is currently of interest in hohlraums for laser-driven inertial fusion research. For a concrete example, consider formula_81 and formula_82 for both ion species, and charge states Z=5 for boron and Z=50 for gold. We leave the boron atomic fraction formula_83 unspecified (note formula_84). Thus, formula_85 and formula_86.\n\nIon acoustic waves are damped both by Coulomb collisions and collisionless Landau damping. The Landau damping occurs on both electrons and ions, with the relative importance depending on parameters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901563", "title": "Imaginary (sociology)", "text": "Imaginary (sociology)\n\nThe imaginary (or social imaginary) is the set of values, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social group and the corresponding society through which people imagine their social whole. The concept of the imaginary has attracted attention in anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and media studies.\n\nFor John Thompson, the social imaginary is \"the creative and symbolic dimension of the social world, the dimension through which human beings create their ways of living together and their ways of representing their collective life\".\n\nFor Manfred Steger and Paul James \"imaginaries are patterned convocations of the social whole. These deep-seated modes of understanding provide largely pre-reflexive parameters within which people imagine their social existence—expressed, for example, in conceptions of 'the global,' 'the national,' 'the moral order of our time.'\"\n\nIn 1975, Cornelius Castoriadis used the term in his book \"The Imaginary Institution of Society\", maintaining that 'the imaginary of the society ... creates for each historical period its singular way of living, seeing and making its own existence'. For Castoriadis, 'the central imaginary significations of a society ... are the laces which tie a society together and the forms which define what, for a given society, is \"real\"'.\n\nIn similar fashion, Habermas wrote of 'the massive background of an intersubjectively shared lifeworld ... lifeworld contexts that provided the backing of a massive background consensus'.\n\n\"The imaginary is presented by Lacan as one of the three intersecting orders that structure all human existence, the others being the symbolic and the real\". Lacan was responding to \"\"L'Imaginaire\", which was the title of the 'phenomenological psychology of the imagination' published by Sartre in 1940, where it refers to the image as a form of consciousness\". Lacan also drew on the way \"Melanie Klein pushes back the limits within which we can see the subjective function of identification operate\", in her work on phantasy—something extended by her followers to the analysis of how \"we are all prone to be drawn into \"social phantasy systems\"...the experience of being \"in\" a particular set of human collectivities\". \"While it is only in the early years of childhood that human beings live entirely in the Imaginary, it remains distinctly present throughout the life of the individual\".\n\nThe imaginary as a Lacanian term refers to an illusion and fascination with an image of the body as coherent unity, deriving from the dual relationship between the ego and the specular or mirror image. This illusion of coherence, control and totality is by no means unnecessary or inconsequential. \"The term 'imaginary' is obviously cognate with 'fictive' but in its Lacanian sense it is not simply synonymous with fictional or unreal; on the contrary, imaginary identifications can have very real effects\".\n\nCanadian philosopher Charles Taylor uses the concept of modern social imaginaries to explore the Western transition from the hierarchical norms of pre-modern social imaginaries to the egalitarian, horizontal, direct access social imaginary of modernity. He sees the Renaissance ideal of civility and self-fashioning as a sort of halfway house on the road to modernity and modern morality. The modern social imaginary he considers comprises a system of interlocking spheres, including reflexivity and the social contract, public opinion and Habermas' public sphere, the political/market economy as an independent force, and the self-government of citizens within a society as a normative ideal.\n\nTaylor has acknowledged the influence of Benedict Anderson in his formulation of the concept of the social imaginary. Anderson treated the nation as 'an imagined political community...nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artifacts of a particular kind'.\n\nWhile not constituting an established reality, the social imaginary is nevertheless an institution in as much as it represents the system of meanings that govern a given social structure. These imaginaries are to be understood as historical constructs defined by the interactions of subjects in society. In that sense, the imaginary is not necessarily \"real\" as it is an \"imagined\" concept contingent on the imagination of a particular social subject. Nevertheless, there remains some debate among those who use the term (or its associated terms, such as \"imaginaire\") as to the ontological status of the \"imaginary.\" Some, such as Henry Corbin, understand the \"imaginary\" to be quite real indeed, while others ascribe to it only a social or imagined reality.\n\nJohn R. Searle considered the ontology of the social imaginary to be complex, but that in practice 'the complex structure of social reality is, so to speak, weightless and invisible. The child is brought up in a culture where he or she simply takes social reality for granted...The complex ontology seems simple'. He added the subtle distinction that social reality was observer-relative, and so would 'inherit that ontological subjectivity. But this ontological subjectivity does not prevent claims about observer-relative features from being epistemically objective'.\n\nIn 1995 George E. Marcus edited a book with the title \"Technoscientific Imaginaries\" which ethnographically explored contemporary science and technology. A collection of encounters in the technosciences by a collective of anthropologists and others, the volume aimed to find strategic sites of change in contemporary worlds that no longer fit traditional ideas and pedagogies and that are best explored through a collaborative effort between technoscientists and social scientists. While the Lacanian imaginary is only indirectly invoked, the interplay between emotion and reason, desire, the symbolic order, and the real are repeatedly probed. Crucial to the technical side of these imaginaries are the visual, statistical, and other representational modes of imaging that have both facilitated scientific developments and sometimes misdirected a sense of objectivity and certitude. Such work accepts that 'technological meaning is historically grounded and, as a result, becomes located within a larger social imaginary'.\n\nSeveral media scholars and historians have analyzed the imaginary of technologies as they emerge, such as electricity, mobile phones, and the Internet.\n\nA recent research led by a team from the Université Grenoble Alpes offer to develop the concept of imaginary and understand how it functions when faced with serial works of art.\n\nThis research, published in \"Imaginaire sériel: Les mécanismes sériels à l'oeuvre dans l'acte créatif\", (Jonathan Fruoco and Andréa Rando Martin (Ed.), Grenoble, UGA Edition, 2017), subscribes to Gilbert Durand's Grenoble school of thought and both questions the impact of seriality on our imaginary and defines the imaginary of seriality.\n\nThe development of this concept allows a better understanding of the close link between the ability to condition and organize exchanges between an experience and its representation, and a procedure based on the rhythmical repetition of one, or several, paradigms in a determined and coherent body, which allows their reproduction and inflection 6.\n\nSerial works of art thus form a privileged field of studies since they turn this recursion and redundancy into structuring principles.

It consisted of NWA World Tag Team Champions Don Kernodle and Ivan Koloff plus Ivan's nephew Nikita Koloff whom they were training. After they lost the title, Kernodle was fired and replaced with Krusher Khruschev.\n\nThe Koloffs and Kernodle had been named the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Champions and after his firing, Kernodle was replaced with Kruschev mid reign. The new line-up won the NWA World Tag Team Titles twice (the second time without Kruschev as a championship team member). They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and the Rock 'N Roll Express. Nikita, mentored by Ivan, challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but was defeated by Flair in the main event of the 1985 Great American Bash. After his firing, former team member Kernodle teamed with his brother Rocky to feud with the Koloffs and helped the Express to win the Tag Team Title from them at Starrcade '85: The Gathering.\n\nThey also had many hard-fought matches against The Road Warriors, who could match up in strength and size.\n\nDuring their feud with Magnum T.A., Nikita won the United States Title in a best of seven series. Then in October 1986, Magnum was injured in a car wreck and his career was over. Nikita left the Russian Team and joined Rhodes forcing Ivan and Krusher to feud with them.\n\nKrusher left in December 1986 and Ivan replaced him with Vladimir Petrov to get Nikita. Ivan and Petrov continued to call themselves the Russian Team until they added Dick Murdoch a few months later.\n\nIn 1988, Ivan Koloff and his manager Paul Jones recruited two masked Russian Assassins to feud with Nikita. However, the Assassins and Jones turned on Koloff after he lost a Russian Chain match to Ricky Morton at . Now a babyface, Ivan reunited with Nikita to feud with the Assassins.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901593", "title": "Yves Fortier (lawyer)", "text": "Yves Fortier (lawyer)\n\nLouis Yves Fortier, , Ad.E. (born September 11, 1935), is a Canadian diplomat, trial and appellate lawyer, arbitrator and corporate director. He served as the Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations from August 1988 to December 1991. In August 2013, he became a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee and the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. He also served as the national president of the Canadian Bar Association in 1982-1983.\n\nFortier was born in Quebec City in 1935. His father was a regional service agent for passengers on the Canadian Pacific Railway. After Fortier earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Université de Montréal in 1955 and was considering a legal career, his father encouraged him to apply to the law school at McGill University in Montreal to improve his English. At that time, McGill taught in English only. When Fortier said he was worried about learning law in English, his father said: \"Yves, les anglophones assis à côté de toi, ils n'ont jamais fait de droit en anglais non plus\". (\"Yves, the anglophones sitting beside you will have never learned law in English either.\") Fortier applied to McGill and was accepted, and then successfully persuaded the McGill faculty that he should be able to sit his examinations in French. He graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from McGill in 1958.\n\nWhile at McGill, Fortier met his future wife, Carol Eaton, who was studying for her Bachelor of Arts degree. Her father encouraged Fortier to apply for a Rhodes scholarship following his graduation from McGill, although Fortier jokes that \"Je pense qu'il voulait m'éloigner de sa fille\" (\"I think he wanted to get me away from his daughter.\")\n\nFortier was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in 1958, for two years. At that time, Rhodes scholars were required to be single and to live in a college at Oxford. He and Carol deferred their marriage for a year, with his commitment to her that he would try to get the regulation changed. In his first major advocacy, he and some other Rhodes scholars in similar situations were able to persuade the Prefect of Rhodes House to change the rule. He and Carol married in 1959. The next year he received his Bachelor of Letters degree from the University of Oxford.\n\nFortier insisted with his wife that their children be educated in French. He believes that it is extremely important to protect the French language in Quebec.\n\nFortier keeps fit with tennis, skiing, and especially cross-country skiing. He and his wife travel extensively.\n\nBrian Mulroney, Fortier's friend, former law partner, and former Prime Minister of Canada, has said that Fortier was consistently considered one of the top three courtroom lawyers in Canada. Fortier has said that he does not like being called an \"avocat\" or advocate, and prefers the terms \"plaideur\", meaning one who seeks to persuade. One of his other colleagues has described him: \"Bien des plaideurs oublient que leur objectif est de convaincre. Ils parlent fort, ils sont agressifs, mais ça ne marche pas. Yves, lui, est persuasif : il a de l'humour, des idées, du charme, il est rigoureux\" (\"A lot of lawyers forget that their objective is to convince. They speak loudly, they are aggressive, but that doesn't work. But Yves, he is persuasive: he is humorous, he has ideas and charm, and he is rigorous\").\n\nFortier was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1976. In 2007, he was appointed \"Avocat émérite\" (\"Ad.E.\") by the Barreau du Québec, one of the first recipients of the award.\n\nIn 2002 while serving on the board of Nortel Fortier was the subject of a conflict of interest controversy as he both sat on the board and provided billed legal services to the company. He stepped down from the board in 2005 during an accounting scandal.\n\nSince becoming an international arbitrator, Fortier has developed an impressive reputation. One of his former colleagues from Ogilvy Renault, Pierre Bienvenu, has stated that he is one of the four or five international arbitrators who are most in demand in the world.\n\nHe has been described as humble, treating junior lawyers with respect, and always willing to share credit on major files with other people who have worked on them with him.\n\nFortier has described himself as both a Quebec nationalist and a committed federalist. Growing up, he saw the domination of the anglophone minority in Quebec. For instance, his father could not rise above a certain position in his career because he was francophone. At the same time, he rejected the sovereigntist approach of René Lévesque. Mulroney has joked that Fortier has only one defect: being a Liberal.\n\nIn 1961, he was called to the Quebec bar. He joined the well-known firm of Ogilvy Renault, where he practised for half a century. While at Ogilvy Renault, he developed a friendship with another young lawyer, Brian Mulroney, who went on to be Prime Minister of Canada. Fortier served as Chairman of Ogilvy Renault from 1992 to 2009. He left the firm on good terms in 2011 to establish a solo international arbitration practice.\n\nFortier developed an active civil litigation practice, both within Canada and internationally. He acted in a wide range of litigation matters: commercial law, bankruptcy cases, tax law, competition law, and divorces all came within his practice. He appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada on twenty-five cases, including lead counsel for the Government of Canada on one of the most important Supreme Court cases, the \"Reference re Secession of Quebec\". He also argued before international arbitration panels, including the International Court of Justice. He has represented Canada in boundary disputes with the United States over the boundary with Maine, and with France in relation to St Pierre and Miquelon, as well as fisheries disputes with the United States. He has been counsel to several royal commissions and public inquiries, as well as counsel to the Government of Quebec in relations with the Cree Nation in Quebec.\n\nOn November 15, 2010, Ogilvy Renault LLP joined with London-based law firm Norton Rose. In 2011, citing potential conflicts of interest posed by the expansion of the firm's clientele, Fortier left Norton Rose and established his own firm in order to continue his career as an international arbitrator independently.\n\nIn 1988, Fortier was contacted by his old law partner, now Prime Minister Mulroney, who offered him an appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada. Fortier turned it down, explaining later: \"Juge à la Cour suprême, ça n'était pas dans mon ADN. Vivre comme un moine. Fréquenter les mêmes huit personnes. Sans pouvoir lâcher son fou. Non merci.\" (\"Judge on the Supreme Court, that wasn't in my DNA. Living like a monk. Hanging out with the same eight people. Not being able to let loose. No thanks.\") Although the fact that he declined an appointment is now public knowledge, he has said that he would have preferred that the story never have leaked out.\n\nAfter Fortier turned down the appointment to the Supreme Court, Mulroney instead offered to appoint him Canada's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Fortier accepted the position, serving for four years, from 1988 to 1992. From 1989 until 1990, he was also Canada's representative to the UN Security Council and in October 1989 was the President of the Security Council. Fortier was Canada's principal delegate to four sessions of the General Assembly, including serving as Vice-President at one of those sessions.\n\nThe role of ambassador at the United Nations was much more to his taste than a judicial appointment would have been. He was constantly using his skills as an advocate and mediator, advancing Canada's position while responding to initiatives from the ambassadors of other countries. He also acknowledged that his personal connection to the Prime Minister was of great assistance. He summed up his term as being at the right place at the right time: \"During my term in New York, the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Union broke up, we went through the first Gulf War, Nelson Mandela was released — how wonderful it was to meet him! Let's say that all this gave me exposure to some outstanding matters.\"\n\nFive years after his term as ambassador ended, Fortier was invited to give the annual O.D. Skelton Lecture organized by the federal Department of Foreign Affairs (now Global Affairs Canada). In his address, he gave a retrospective on his time at the United Nations and his opinion on the value of the organization. He concluded that the United Nations served an increasingly important role in the international community. In his opinion, international issues are too large and too complex for any one nation to solve. Multilateral solutions are necessary, and the United Nations provides the avenue for such solutions to be found. Fortier also emphasized that Canada has an important role to play at the United Nations: Canada's views are solicited and do count. Fortier rejected the popular myth that the United Nations is mainly dominated by dictators and petty tyrants. He also suggested that Canada's participation in the United Nations helps to free Canada from dominance by the United States. Overall, Fortier said that he had become almost a missionary in speaking for the good played by the United Nations.\n\nAfter his term as Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations, Fortier decided he would concentrate on acting as an arbitrator in international commercial matters, rather than returning to his civil litigation practice. Through his firm he made contacts with some of the leading arbitrators in the United Kingdom, which led to him being appointed the chair of a panel on a major arbitration concerning the Channel Tunnel. From that point on, he focused on international arbitrations.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1989, Fortier was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration located at The Hague, Netherlands. From 1998 to 2001, he served as President of the London Court of International Arbitration.\n\nAfter leaving Ogilvy Renault, in 2012 Fortier joined Arbitration Place in Toronto and is currently a Member Arbitrator. He is also a member of 20 Essex Street in London, a commercial barristers and arbitrators chambers.\n\nIn June 2012, Fortier was appointed chair of the World Bank Group's Sanctions Board in order to help combat corruption and fraud in projects financed by the World Bank.\n\nIn 1993, Fortier was asked to investigate a controversy at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The outgoing president of the National Hockey League, Gil Stein, had been elected to the Hall, but rumours arose that he had put undue pressure to ensure his induction. Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, retained Fortier and an American lawyer, Arnold Burns, former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, to review the issue. In their report, they concluded that Stein had \"improperly manipulated the process\" and \"created the false appearance and illusion\" that the owner of the Los Angeles Kings, Bruce McNall had put Stein's name forward. Stein denied this suggestion and argued that it had been McNall's idea. Nonetheless, the upshot was that Stein withdrew his nomination.\n\nFortier was the presiding member of the arbitration panel in the Yukos arbitration, which resulted in the largest award ever made by an international arbitration panel. (The other two members of the panel were Arbitrators Charles Poncet and Stephen M. Schwebel.)\n\nThe arbitration involved a major dispute between the shareholders of Yukos, a Russian energy company, and the government of Russia. The shareholders argued that the Russian government had improperly expropriated the company, allegedly to satisfy unpaid back-taxes. The arbitration was argued under the Energy Charter Treaty. In 2009, the panel held that it had jurisdiction to hear the complaint.\n\nIn 2014, the panel ruled on the merits of the claim and ruled in favour of the shareholders. The panel awarded more than US$50 billion to the shareholders, the largest award ever made by an international arbitration panel. However, Russia then applied to the District Court of The Hague to have the awards set aside. In 2016, the District Court ruled that the panel did not have jurisdiction under the Energy Charter Treaty, and set aside the award. It is now under appeal to The Hague Court of Appeal for a full \"de novo\" hearing, which could take several years.\n\nOn August 8, 2013, Fortier was appointed to a five-year term on the Security Intelligence Review Committee, the federal watchdog over the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. For this reason, he was sworn in as a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on the same day.\n\nIn 2014, the Committee announced that Fortier would chair a panel conducting an inquiry into a complaint that CSIS had spied on citizens conducting peaceful protests over the proposed Keystone oil pipeline. That in turn triggered a request from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, one of the parties to the complaint, that Fortier recuse himself because he had formerly sat on the board of Trans Canada Pipelines, which was now one of the proponents of the project, and also held a large number of shares in that company. However, Fortier declined to recuse himself and the hearing went ahead as scheduled in Vancouver in 2015.\n\nFortier has been active in the Canadian Bar Association throughout his career, at both the provincial and national levels. From 1975 to 1976, he was the president of the Quebec Branch of the CBA. Then, from 1982 to 1983, he was the national president of the CBA.\n\nThe mid-1970s were a turbulent time in Canadian and Quebec politics. Fortier and the CBA played a part in the constitutional debate triggered by the election of the separatist Parti québécois government of René Lévesque in the provincial election of 1976.\n\nAt the national meeting of the CBA in 1977, following the election of the PQ the previous year, the outgoing national president, Boyd Ferris, proposed that the CBA should declare itself in support of national unity and a strong federal government. A resolution to that effect was introduced by Paul Fraser, the president of the British Columbia Branch of the CBA and seconded by Robert Lesage, the president of the Quebec Branch.\n\nThe resolution was controversial, because some members did not think the CBA should take a position on a political issue, while members from Quebec objected that the resolution was attempting to impose a particular view of the sovereignty issue as a condition of membership in the CBA. There were considerable debates and negotiations on the proposed resolution, which resulted in an amendment being moved by Fortier and Bryan Williams, the incoming president of the BC Branch. The amendments removed the language calling for the CBA to support national unity and to reject provincial separatism. Instead, the resolution called on the CBA to create a Committee on the Constitution which would consider the constitutional issues facing the country and prepare a detailed report on possible amendments to the Constitution of Canada. The CBA passed the amended version of the resolution as proposed by Fortier and Williams.\n\nThe resolution called for the Constitution to be re-written \"so as better to meet the aspriations and present-day needs of all the people of Canada and to guarantee the preservation of the historical rights of our two founding cultures.\" The resolution also set out the mandate for the Committee, which was to undertake \"the search for a definition of the essential constitutional attributes of a Canadian federalism\", with a final report to be presented at the next Annual Meeting of the CBA in 1978. Following the passage of the resolution, the new president of the CBA, Jacques Viau, set up the Committee. The members were drawn from each province of Canada, and included two future provincial premiers, a future Supreme Court justice, two future provincial chief justices. Fortier was the member from Quebec.\n\nThe Committee released its report at the next annual meeting of the CBA at Halifax in 1978. The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations for constitutional change, including a completely new constitution, abolishing the monarchy, changing the Senate, entrenching language rights and a bill of rights, and changing the balance of powers between the federal government and the provinces.\n\nIn 2014, Fortier was one of eleven past-presidents of the CBA who intervened in a dispute between the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, and the Chief Justice of Canada, Beverley McLachlin, over the appointment of Justice Marc Nadon to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Prime Minister criticised the Chief Justice, alleging that she had acted improperly. The CBA past-presidents defended her actions, as did the then-President, Fred Headon.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, the federal government appointed Justice Nadon of the Federal Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Although he was sworn in, an issue arose whether he was eligible to be appointed under the terms of the Supreme Court Act. In the spring of 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that Justice Nadon was not eligible to be appointed, because he was on the Federal Court of Appeal rather than on a Quebec superior court, as required by the Supreme Court Act. After the Supreme Court's decision, the Prime Minister publicly criticised the Chief Justice, saying that she had behaved improperly in speaking of the qualification issue during a consultation about the appointment some nine months earlier, with the Minister of Justice, Peter McKay.\n\nFortier and ten other past-presidents of the CBA then wrote an open letter to \"The Globe and Mail\", criticising the Prime Minister's conduct. They stated: \"... these circumstances leave us concerned that the Prime Minister's statements may intimidate or harm the ability of the Supreme Court of Canada to render justice objectively and fairly – even when the government of Canada chooses to be a litigant before it.\"\n\nIn addition to Fortier, the letter was signed by Paul D.K. Fraser, Q.C. of Vancouver; Thomas G. Heintzman, Q.C. of Toronto; Daphne Dumont, Q.C. of Charlottetown; Simon V. Potter of Montreal; William Johnson, Q.C. of Regina; Susan McGrath of Iroquois Falls; Bernard Amyot of Montreal; Guy Joubert of Winnipeg; D. Kevin Carroll, Q.C. of Barrie; and Rod Snow of Whitehorse.\n\nIn 2015, Fortier was one of seventeen past-presidents of the Canadian Bar Association wrote an open letter to the Globe and Mail, criticising plans to locate a proposed Memorial to the Victims of Communism immediately adjacent to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nWhile not opposing the idea of the monument itself, the group of past-presidents argued that it was inappropriate for an overtly political memorial to be placed adjacent to the Supreme Court, which is politically neutral: \"It is ill conceived, however, to add an imposing sculpture signalling a strong political message, controversial or not, literally in the face of the very institution which is the final arbiter in Canada of disputes involving Canadians, the federal and provincial governments, and foreign litigants.\"\n\nIn addition to Fortier, the letter was signed by Paul D.K. Fraser, Q.C. of Vancouver; Wayne Chapman, Q.C. of Saint John; J.J. Camp, Q.C. of Vancouver; Thomas G. Heintzman, Q.C. of Toronto; Gordon F. Proudfoot, Q.C. of Dartmouth; Russell Lusk, Q.C. of Vancouver; Daphne Dumont, Q.C. of Charlottetown; Simon V. Potter of Montreal; Susan T. McGrath of Iroquois Falls; Brian A. Tabor, Q.C. of Halifax; Bernard Amyot of Montreal; J. Guy Joubert of Winnipeg; D. Kevin Carroll, Q.C, of Barrie; Rod Snow of Whitehorse; Trinda L. Ernst, Q.C. of Kentville; and Robert Brun, Q.C. of Vancouver.\n\nLate in 2015, the federal government announced that it would move the proposed memorial to a different location.\n\nFortier was also active in business affairs, and was involved with several major corporations. From 1997 to 2006, he was Governor (Company Chairman) of the Hudson's Bay Company, North America's oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670). Fortier was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the aluminum company Alcan Inc. from 2002 to 2007, prior to its acquisition by Rio Tinto, becoming Rio Tinto Alcan. He also served as a director on several other publicly traded corporations, including Royal Bank of Canada, Trans Canada Pipelines Limited, Dupont Canada Inc., Westinghouse Canada Inc., Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and Nortel.\n\nIn 2009, Fortier set up an entrance scholarship and made a substantial donation to fund a lecturer series at McGill Law School. The \"L. Yves Fortier Entrance Scholarship\" is an annual $10,000 scholarship for a first year law student who displays a commitment to bilingualism, as Fortier himself did as a law student. The scholarship is funded by a donation of $200,000 which Fortier gave to the law school.\n\nIn addition, Fortier gave a donation of $50,000 to fund the \"John E.C. Brierley Memorial Lectures\". In 2003, Fortier had been the first speaker in the lecture series, which was named after a former dean of McGill Law School who worked in the area of arbitration.\n\nThese donations came just two months after the aluminium company, Rio Tinto Alcan, had made a donation of $3 million to endow in honour of Fortier, the former chairman of Alcan. The \"L. Yves Fortier Chair in International Arbitration and International Commercial Law\" commemorated Fortier's leadership in the field of arbitration.\n\nAlso in 2009, the firm and partners at Ogilvy Renault gave a combined gift of $1 million to the McGill Law School, to support Ogilvy Renault Faculty Scholars in Arbitration in Commercial Law. Fortier's personal share of the donation was $250,000.\n\n\n"}

It became the second single to be released from the album \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\", peaking at number four on the UK Singles Charts. Though the single was a success, it is still awaiting a Silver certification in the United Kingdom, unlike all their previous singles (\"Supersonic\" and \"Shakermaker\" had also initially failed to reach this milestone, but were eventually certified Silver in 2006 and 2013, respectively).\n\nThe album was noted for its psychedelic feel, and \"Who Feels Love?\" was held up as the most extreme example of this. Mark Stent was praised for his production on the song, creating a \"trippy\" feel like that found on Beatles songs such as \"Rain\". With the psychedelic and Eastern sound, the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like \"Within You Without You\" and also some of his solo work. However, despite the acclaimed production, the song itself was not well received by the critics, with \"NME\" stating that the production \"triumphs over any real sort of feeling... pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self-parody\".\n\nOne of the B-sides is a cover of The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\". It was played live during the Shoulders tour of 2000. Paul Weller recorded a version of b-side \"One Way Road\" for his covers-album \"Studio 150\" in 2004.

She has four brothers and an older sister who died at the age of two from an undetected heart defect. When Lynn was three, her parents divorced after it was discovered her father had a family with another woman. Shortly after, Lynn's mother suffered a nervous breakdown, and Lynn was placed in foster care, where she was sexually abused. She was reunited with her mother when she was seven. Shortly after, the two of them were involved in a car accident on the interstate; Lynn was thrown clear of the car and her mother died at the scene.\n\nLynn and her brothers were placed with her father and his new family; in total there were eight boys and Lynn in the house. When Lynn was eleven, her father died of alcoholism and heart failure. As a teenager, Lynn self-described her change as going from \"pudgy kind of bucktoothed\" tomboy to a \"rocking little body\". She started doing fitness modeling, bikini modeling, and hot body contests. She relocated to Hollywood and became a regular at the clubs on Sunset Strip.\n\nLynn was a bikini and figure model in Los Angeles in the early 1980s; following this she was featured in nude magazine photo spreads for \"Penthouse\", \"Hustler\", \"Chic\", \"High Society\" and \"Club\" magazines. Lynn made the transition from nude modeling to pornographic films with an appearance in Bobby Hollander's 1983 feature \"Personal Touch 3\" in a scene with Craig Roberts. In 1983, shortly after her photo spread appeared in \"Penthouse\" magazine, she went to an audition for a movie where the director was a well-known porn veteran. There, in an effort to calm her nervousness, the director offered Lynn a pipe with some freebase cocaine. It was her first encounter with the drug; she later described the feeling of being as \"It's as if the birds are singing. The light is brighter. All of a sudden I'm no longer this gangly nervous teenager. I'm sitting there going 'Oh wow!.\n\nLynn was the first female performer to open the door for adult film stars to be featured in dance touring, being recognized for this accomplishment throughout the United States and Canada. Lynn was the highest paid female performer on the strip club circuit, making $32,000 a week.\n\nLynn has had roles in non-adult films such as \"Evils of the Night\" (1985) and \"52 Pick-Up\" (1986), and in the television program \"The Man Show\" and guest starred as herself in Lionsgate's \"Who's Jenna...?\" (2018).\n\nFor her 28th birthday in 1992, Lynn hosted a benefit birthday party at the Bel Age hotel in Beverly Hills. The benefit was in honor of The Youth AIDS Foundation of Los Angeles, an organization providing housing and assistance for helping runaways get off the streets and for teenagers with HIV, which was about to go under. An August 1992 issue of \"The Los Angeles Times\" quoted her statement on page two: \"Let's give them food, clothing and shelter and we'll worry about role models later\", alongside a shot of her dressed in a formal gown, holding an infant girl. This was a breakthrough moment for how the adult industry was viewed by the mainstream concerning its crossover involvement in children's organizations, as never before had a children's organization knowingly accepted support from the adult entertainment industry.\n\nLynn has opposed the Los Angeles \"Safer Sex in the Adult-Film Industry\" initiative, which mandates that actors in adult films shot in Los Angeles County use condoms. She has been involved in the first charity to accept contributions from the adult film industry, Youth AIDS Foundation of Los Angeles, since 1992. She also helps other charities such as Childhood Cancer Awareness, The Southern California Toy Run and Janie's Fund, Steven Tyler's new organization.\n\nLynn hosts a weekly talk show called \"Rock’N'SeXXXy UnCensored\" on LATalkRadio.com and Stitcher.com. She is a member of the Adult Video News (AVN) Hall of Fame and was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Free Speech Coalition. She continues to perform as an adult actress.\n\nAmber Lynn is the sister of porn actor Buck Adams. Lynn met porn actor Jamie Gillis on the set of her second-ever pornographic film, and the two began a long-time relationship.\n\nLynn had her first experience with cocaine on a porn set very early in her career. She eventually became addicted to cocaine, a drug addiction that lasted for nearly two decades. She once said, \"I started out drinking Ketel One and slicing off crystals of Peruvian rock. I wound up broken down, drinking Kamchatka Vodka out of a half-pint stashed in the bottom of my purse, with my crack pipe stuffed in the lining of my jacket\". She has been clean and sober since 2000, and occasionally works as a personal recovery assistant, helping addicts to detox.

Events have also been held in other locations around the world, including Europe, Australia, Mexico, Costa Rica, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Japan.\n\nAt Monster Jam events, monster trucks face off in three forms of competition: racing, two-wheel skills, and freestyle.\n\nRacing is traditional heads-up tournament racing, where the first truck to cross the finish line moves onto the next round; the final race of the night is for that particular event's championship.\n\nThe freestyle competition allows drivers two minutes on an open floor to show off their skills as they drive the trucks over ramps and junked cars, performing stunts and tricks with their trucks. The freestyle winner is determined by attendees voting via a score tracking website.\n\nEach event produces its own winner. If the same driver wins both events that night, they receive the \"Double Down\" trophy.\n\nBetween the two main competitions, other events are held. Some shows, but not many; feature a \"donut\" competition in which a driver tries to spin their truck until the driver or the truck, is unable to continue, or they think they have a high enough score to win.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2018, the tour began in January and ended in March, with the World Finals in Las Vegas every year, with shows continuing into the summer and fall months. From 2019 and beyond the tour will still begin in January but will now end in May with the World Finals at a rotating venue each year, with shows continuing until the end of the year. The tours visit many major cities in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Central America, South Africa, and Australia.\n\nIn 2015, an arena tour called \"#MoreMonsterJam\" debuted. This tour featured 8 drivers driving 3 different vehicles in a points series. The top two finishers received an invitation to the Monster Jam World Finals 16. Also in 2015, Monster Jam started its first stadium tour called the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. This tour followed 16 drivers each weekend on Fox Sports 1 competing for points in qualifying, racing, obstacle course racing and freestyle. The top four in the series received invitations to the Monster Jam World Finals 16. In 2016, the #MoreMonsterJam series was split into two series, east and west, with the winner of each tour getting an invitation to Monster Jam World Finals 17. Since then the number of regional tours has increased, both for stadium and arena tours.\n\nIn 2019, the Monster Jam calendar featured four arena tours with 8 drivers each; each tour's winner receives a spot at the Monster Jam World Finals XX in Orlando. The schedule also includes three stadium tours, each with 14 drivers competing for one spot in Monster Jam World Finals XX. There will be also an international tour consisting of 10 drivers competing in Europe and South Africa, but that tour will not offer a spot into World Finals XX.\n\nFollowing the World Finals, additional exhibition tours are held through much of the rest of the year. These include stadiums tours in northern cities where it is too cold during the main competition season to hold outdoor events.\n\nThe Monster Jam World Finals are the culmination of the Monster Jam winter season, featuring top drivers from the year. It is often referred to as the \"Super Bowl of monster trucks\" and features drivers competing for the racing and freestyle championships.\n\nFor the first 19 World Finals, the event was held annually at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. On February 15, 2018, a new format was announced where the World Finals would rotate venues annually, beginning with World Finals XX. The original location for World Finals XX was set to be MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but it was later changed to Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida.\n\nWorld Finals XXI was scheduled for May 2–3, 2020, at Camping World Stadium. The event was later cancelled due to public health concerns regarding the international coronavirus pandemic. This is the first time that a Monster Jam World Finals event has been cancelled.\n\nOn January 8, 2020, Monster Jam announced that they would be establishing a Hall of Fame, dedicated to honor those who, \"have made immeasurable contributions to the sport\". Dennis Anderson, creator and former driver of Grave Digger, and Scott Douglass, longtime announcer of Monster Jam events, were announced as the inaugural class of the new Hall of Fame at a live event at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on January 11, 2020. They were set to be officially inducted at an awards ceremony during the weekend of World Finals XXI prior to the event's cancellation.\n\nMattel's Hot Wheels brand produced officially licensed toy versions of monster trucks under the Monster Jam name. They also sponsored a monster truck which competed in the series in previous years. Monster Jam and Mattel's contract ended in 2018. Monster Jam toys are now produced by Spin Master, starting in January 2019.\n\nFive officially licensed Monster Jam video games have been produced. The first two, \"\", a vehicular combat game, and \"\", an arcade racing game, were published by Ubisoft. The third, titled simply \"Monster Jam\", was released by Activision on November 13, 2007, and a sequel to it called \"\" was released on October 28, 2008. A fifth game, \"\", was released on November 9, 2010. On June 17, 2015 \"Monster Jam Battlegrounds\" was released as a download on Xbox Live and Steam. \"\" was released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on October 25, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on October 31, 2017.\n\nTraxxas released a series of radio controlled former and current Monster Jam monster trucks, including Bigfoot, Grave Digger or Monster Mutt.\n\nMonster Jam originally aired on TNN and Speed, with season preview and World Finals recap packages occasionally airing on CBS as part of the \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" from 2007 to 2012. From 2014 to 2018, FS1 and FS2 aired events form the series. Beginning in 2019, NBC Sports started airing the show on NBCSN.\n\nRecaps from each event are posted on Monster Jam's official YouTube account the following week.\nInternationally, Monster Jam aired on One in Australia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1901677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901677", "title": "Material Issue", "text": "Material Issue\n\nMaterial Issue was an American power pop trio from Chicago, Illinois. The band's trademark was pop songs with themes of love and heartbreak, with a number of song titles using girls' first names.\n\nFormed in 1985, Material Issue was the brainchild of frontman Jim Ellison, who also played guitar, sang lead vocals, and wrote most Material Issue songs. Ellison met Material Issue's bassist Ted Ansani while both were attending Columbia College Chicago in 1986. Drummer Mike Zelenko was found through an ad in the \"Illinois Entertainer\" later that year.\n\nIn 1987, Material Issue released an EP on their own Big Block Label (so named for the big block engines of the 1970s muscle cars Ellison loved) which operated out of Ellison's bedroom at his parents’ home in Addison, Illinois. In 1988, \"Sixteen Tambourines\" appeared on \"CMJ New Music Report\"'s compilation and \"CMJ\" referred to Material Issue's music as a \"hooky brand of high-powered psycho-pop\". In 1989, they released the single \"Renee Remains The Same\" which got heavy airplay around Chicago. Over the next two years, the band toured extensively across the Midwest and found time to record what would become their debut album \"International Pop Overthrow\". The album was a compilation of various demos recorded between roughly 1988-1991 and produced by Jeff Murphy from the Chicago area power pop band Shoes, and recorded at Short Order Recorder, their studio in Zion, Illinois.\n\nIn early 1991, Material Issue broke onto the national scene with their debut album \"International Pop Overthrow\" which sold over 300,000 copies for Mercury Records. Their debut video for the single \"Diane\" appeared on MTV's 120 Minutes in late December 1990 which was the episode of the final appearance of Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson of The Replacements in sort of a fitting segue between the lesser-known music genres of the two decades. Also, Material Issue and The Replacements shared the stage at Taste of Chicago in 1991, which was the swansong for The Replacements. \"IPO\" had extensive national airplay with \"Valerie Loves Me\" and \"Diane\" and music critic Jae-Ha Kim declared \"Simple Minds upstaged by Material Issue\".\n\n1992 saw the follow-up to \"IPO\" with \"Destination Universe\" which was also produced by Jeff Murphy at Short Order Recorder, and included the single \"What Girls Want\" in addition to ballads such as \"Next Big Thing\" and \"Everything\". Material Issue continued to tour heavily across the country in support of both albums. The new album was not as well received by critics as the debut album, nor did it sell as well.\n\n1994 saw the release of \"Freak City Soundtrack\" which featured the single \"Kim The Waitress\" (a cover of The Green Pajamas, written by Jeff Kelly). The band also created a music video for \"Kim the Waitress\". However, by the time \"Freak City Soundtrack\" was released, the momentum they had generated in the previous five years had begun to subside. Freak City sold fewer than 50,000 copies as the Seattle scene and the emergence of ska dominated both mainstream and alternative music markets. Other Chicago acts to break national following Material Issue, such as Smashing Pumpkins, Urge Overkill, and Liz Phair, had music more fitting for the times and Material Issue, feeling left behind by their label, parted ways with Mercury in early 1995.\n\nMaterial Issue continued touring, selling out venues throughout the upper Midwest. In the summer of 1995 the band co-headlined the first Edgefest in Somerset, Wisconsin (named for its sponsor, Minneapolis-St. Paul alternative radio station 93.7 The Edge). In 1995, the group, with Liz Phair, recorded a cover of the Banana Splits’ theme song titled \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\" for the tribute album \"\", produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. Throughout the remainder of 1995 and into 1996, Material Issue had recorded a set of new songs with the intention of shopping them to a new label. However, the band came to a tragic and sudden end when Ellison committed suicide on June 20, 1996 by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage. No one knows for sure what compelled Ellison to end his life but the loss of their record label in 1995 as well as an end to a long term relationship on his 32nd birthday (April 18, 1996) are likely contributors to his decision to commit suicide. A suicide note was found by police, but the contents of that note remain known only to Ellison's family. The recordings from the work done in 1995 and 1996 was released posthumously on \"Telecommando Americano\" in 1997 by Rykodisc. \"Telecommando Americano\" was the final Material Issue release, and also included the 6-song EP released back in 1987 as a bonus.\n\nThe legacy of Material Issue as the consummate 1990s power pop band lives on in the International Pop Overthrow festival that plays in Los Angeles, New York City and Chicago each year. The IPO festival (renamed IPO from Poptopia in the late 90s to honor Material Issue) is the largest showcase of power pop music in the United States and brings in power pop bands from all over the world to showcase what is new in the world of power pop music.\n\nDespite albums receiving extremely positive reviews and reception, Material Issue is often overlooked among music of the era. They are often considered to have reached their climax in a misplaced era. In an era of grunge music, the pop-based Material Issue was ahead of their musical times.\n\nTed Ansani continues to work in the music business in Chicago and had played bass for several post-Material Issue projects and released his own solo EP in 2000 called \"Throttle and Pistons - The Ted Ansani Project\". He has made several solo appearances in the last few years in and around Chicago and has also played the IPO festival when it has come to Chicago. His website carries the banner of the Material Issue legacy which reminds readers of Material Issue's place in rock history. Ansani is married with three children.\n\nMike Zelenko continues to play drums and has also played with several post-Material Issue projects. He has drummed for Green, the Darlings and most recently Zelenko has been playing with a new power pop band from Chicago called The Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\nIn 2002, the song \"Everything\", from the \"Destination Universe\" album, was covered by the band Stereo Fuse and received moderate airplay on alternative radio.\n\nThe Tragically Hip song \"Escape Is At Hand For The Travellin' Man\", from the album \"Phantom Power\", is a tribute to Ellison.\n\nAustralian power pop band the Pyramidiacs also released a tribute song to Ellison, entitled \"Jim\", on their 1997 album \"Teeter Totter\".\n\nOriginal drummer Danny Thompson is currently playing for punk rock legends, Face to Face, and metal band the Uprising. Both bands are from southern California. The original bassist, Lance Tawzer, went on to form The Lupins (RCA Records) and wrote a song for the movie \"Dumb and Dumber\"; he married Q101 (WKQX) DJ Samantha James and they have two children.\n\nIn 2018, it was announced via Facebook that a feature-length documentary was in production with the band as the subject. The film entered post-production in August 2019. It is set to come out within the first half of 2021. The documentary will feature people like Rick Nielsen, Jeff Kwatinetz, Matt Pinfield, Steve Albini, Mike Chapman, and the original members of the band.\n\nIn 2011, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the \"International Pop Overthrow\" album, the two surviving members, Mike Zelenko and Ted Ansani, reformed the band under the name Material Reissue. Chicago based singer-songwriter Phil Angotti (who had recorded as The Idea) joined them, filling in for Jim Ellison. The show was part of the \"International Pop Overthrow\" festival, named after the album, and took place at the Abbey Pub in Chicago on April 23, 2011. Material Reissue then performed at the Taste of Chicago on June 28, 2011, at Summerfest in Milwaukee on July 8, 2011, and Lincoln Hall on September 17, 2011. They performed in what was billed as their final show ever on December 31 at Reggie's Rock Club. However the band's local cult following kept them continuing to perform live occasionally over the next several years. On August 23, 2019, the band is scheduled to perform at Skokie's Backlot Bash as opener for fellow 1980s and 19'90s power-pop legends The Smithereens, with guest vocalist Marshall Crenshaw. \n\nInternational Pop Overthrow was also re-issued in a 20th Anniversary edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Several more teams were later founded in Berlin and the rest of Germany, as well as a national federation. Cricket lingered on over the following century, with occasional visits of German players to England and British and other foreign teams touring in Germany, but only when it got a foothold in the German universities in the 1980s did the number of German cricket clubs and players start to grow again. Until recently, much of the cricket was played by British soldiers stationed in Germany. However, in recent years the popularity of the game has increased due to an influx of migrants and refugees from cricket-playing countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe national organisation for the game is currently the German Cricket Federation (\"Deutscher Cricket Bund\", DCB), founded in 1988. In 2016 there are about 220 cricket teams in the country, up from 70 in 2012. By 2019, the number of teams had increased to 350.\n\nGermany has a national team that takes part in the European Championship and has also taken part in the ICC Trophy.\n\nGerman Cricket is organized in several regions, which all have their own leagues. The winner of those will play for the national championship.\n\nThose regional associations are:\nClubs playing in the league are:\n\nOther clubs include:\n\nBundesliga Ost:\n\nVerbandsliga Ost:\n\nBritannia, BFC Viktoria 1889, Reinickendorfer Füchse (RFCC), AC Berlin, Dresden, HCCW, Bautzen, USG CCC and Berlin CC field a team in the Verbandsliga too.* field a team in the T20-League\n\nOther teams:\n\nClubs playing in the league are:\n\nA feature of club cricket in Germany is that many clubs experience rapid fluctuation in membership, which is composed largely of expats playing the sport.\nClubs which cannot join a league (mostly due to lack of available members) may still take part in independently arranged friendly matches.\n\nThe club's wicket can vary from a grass pitch (grown on the natural soil) to coconut fibre wickets on concrete, flicx® pitches, and do-it-yourself constructions. The size of the field also varies, from a good club size (English standard) to double hockey pitches which the club hires, and unusual fields such as that at Göttingen, which is large, but has a bank that rises up to 4 metres above the level of the square.\nIndoor cricket is played in various tournaments throughout the winter, mostly in German 3 field gyms, or in indoor tennis halls, in Twenty20 format.\n\nThe majority of cricket clubs are organised into six regional leagues. Each region hosts one or two leagues of 6 or 7 clubs. Matches are over 50 overs. In two of the leagues the first and second placed teams meet in play-offs, and\nthe winner of the play-off is the regional champion. At the end of the regional season, national play-offs are held: the northern league champions (NDCV (North), NRCU (North Rhine Westphalia), BCV (Berlin)) play against each other, and the southern teams (HCV (Hesse), BWCV (Baden Württemberg), BYCV (Bavaria)) do likewise. The overall northern and southern winners then play off for the German Championship. Independent of the regional leagues are 20/20 tournaments which are mostly invitational tournaments initiated by one team.\n\n\n"}

The song's lyrics were written in 1905 by Charles E. Tourison 1905, W. L. Umstad 1906, and Bill Forbes 1906, a trio of roommates at Beta Theta Pi, and set to the tune of George M. Cohan's \"Give My Regards to Broadway\". The song refers to a fictional encounter between an anonymous student and David Fletcher \"Davy\" Hoy (for whom Hoy Field is named), the registrar and secretary for the committee on student conduct, and Thomas Frederick \"Tee Fee\" Crane, the Professor of Languages and the first Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences revolving around the student's expulsion on account of binge drinking. David Hoy was known for his ferocity as a strict disciplinarian. Professor Crane, on the other hand, was generally well liked among students. \"Piker\" is said to be a historical slang term for a freshman, perhaps from the more general term \"piker\" meaning tightwad or cheapskate. \"Theodore Zinck's\" was a bar in downtown Ithaca that has since closed. Its legend still lives on in the weekly event for seniors \"Zinck's Night\", which is celebrated worldwide in October by Cornellians.\n\nThe original and best known lyrics:\n\nTo reflect the changing diversions of students, in 1920, the Cornell Daily Sun published a new version of the song under pen name of \"Lord Helpus.\"\n\nSometime in the 1950s, another unofficial version appeared, referring to President Deane Malott's \"Social Events Standards\" that attempted to ban fraternity parties, to ban women from visiting men's off-campus apartments, and to maintain the strict curfews and sign-in/out times for women. This verse is only a modest form of outrage as compared to the protests that were staged (at one, students burned an effigy of Malott) and the mobs that formed (one marched to President Malott's house demanding his resignation and throwing eggs, rocks, and smoke bombs).\n\n"}
{"id": "1901697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901697", "title": "Meadow Lane", "text": "Meadow Lane\n\nMeadow Lane Stadium is a football stadium in Nottingham, England. It is the home ground of Notts County, who have played there since 1910. The stadium was also home to Notts County Ladies F.C. from 2014 until 2017.\n\nIt currently has an all-seated capacity of 18,816 for National League games, although its maximum capacity is 20,229. The record attendance is 47,310, who watched Notts lose 1–0 to York City in the FA Cup Sixth Round on 12 March 1955.\n\nMeadow Lane lies just away from the City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest. The two grounds are the closest in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. The Trent End of the City Ground is visible from parts of the Jimmy Sirrel stand and the Spion Kop.\n\nThe stadium also hosts the men's and women's football in the Varsity Series – a sporting series contested by Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham.\n\nPrior to 1910, Notts County played their home games across the River Trent at Trent Bridge as a tenant of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Cricket took priority on the ground and the football club were often forced to play early and late season fixtures at other venues to avoid a clash.\n\nThe Football League eventually deemed that this practice was inappropriate and demanded that Notts either seek more favourable terms for the use of Trent Bridge or relocate to a new ground on which they could fulfil all of their fixtures.\n\nIn 1910, a plot of land near the cattle market on the opposite side of the River Trent was leased from the city council and a new stadium hastily erected. Part of the new stadium was a temporary stand from Trent Bridge which was literally floated across the river.\n\nOn 3 September 1910, County moved to Meadow Lane, the first game was a 1–1 draw with old rivals Nottingham Forest, played in front of fans paying receipts of £775.\n\nIn 1920 the landlord, Nottingham Corporation, which leased the land to the club, came very close to removing the club from its premises to make way for an abattoir.\n\nThe stadium remained largely the same until 1923 when the Sneinton Side was replaced with a new stand, named the County Road Stand after the newly constructed road behind it.\n\nMeadow Lane was bombed during World War II forcing the club to suspend all fixtures during the 1942 season. The northern side of the Main Stand was badly damaged and the pitch left in an unplayable condition.\n\nThe stadium has played host to Forest games on a number of occasions. After the war, when flooding from the River Trent left the City Ground in an unplayable condition and again in 1968 when the Main Stand at the City Ground was destroyed by fire in a game against Leeds United.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the stadium became increasingly dilapidated. The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978 and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The Bradford City stadium fire and Hillsborough disaster brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the Taylor Report required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the \"Family Stand\", the \"Jimmy Sirrel Stand\" and the \"Spion Kop Stand\" respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the \"Derek Pavis Stand\".\n\nIn June 2002, as part of a sponsorship deal, the ground was briefly renamed the \"Aaron Scargill Stadium\". However, the ground reverted to its original name when the deal later fell through.\n\nThe Derek Pavis Stand contains a number of conference and function facilities to complement \"The Broken Wheelbarrow\" bar behind the Family Stand. These host numerous functions throughout the year, ranging from social evenings organised by Notts County's supporter organisations, to wedding receptions and meetings of evangelical Christian churches.\n\nAway supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side. This features a triangular gable (a replica of that on the old County Road stand) with the name of the club and its year of formation. Such gables are also present in the stadia of Sheffield Wednesday, Fulham, and Leyton Orient.\n\nThe Family Stand was renamed The Haydn Green Family Stand in 2007, after the man who saved Notts County from liquidation in 2003, by buying the lease on the ground and investing several million pounds. Haydn Green died suddenly in 2007 leaving an estate which still controls the lease on the ground.\n\nOutside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of Jimmy Sirrel and coach Jack Wheeler. Entitled \"Legends of the Lane\", the statue was sculpted by Andy Edwards and unveiled on 5 May 2016.\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that Nottingham Rugby would play a number of home games at the stadium. It was further announced in May 2006 that Notts County and Nottingham Rugby were negotiating making the agreement permanent. In October 2006 it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Notts County, allowing Nottingham Rugby to play the remainder of their 2006/07 home fixtures at Meadow Lane. In 2014 it was announced that the rugby club would move out of Meadow Lane to play at The Bay, West Bridgford.\n\nFor the 2017-18 season, the capacity set by the local authority for football is 19,841. The stadium has a total of 20,211 seats.\n\n"}

Campbell was the author of three \"New York Times\" bestsellers: \"Brothers and Sisters\", \"Singing in the Comeback Choir\", and \"What You Owe Me\", which was also a \"Los Angeles Times\" \"Best Book of 2001\". Her other works include the novel \"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine\", which was a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the Year and the winner of the NAACP Image Award for Literature; her memoir, \"Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad\"; and her first nonfiction book, \"Successful Women, Angry Men: Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage\". Her essays, articles, and excerpts appear in many anthologies.\n\nBorn Elizabeth Bebe Moore, an only child, and reared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education from the University of Pittsburgh. She was an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\n\nCampbell's works of fiction would often relay the harmful impact that racism would inflict on individuals and their relationships. In 1992 Campbell's would release her first, and most critically acclaimed novel, \"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine\", which was described as one of the most influential books of 1992 by \"The New York Times Magazine\" . This book, which was inspired by the murder of Emmett Till in 1955, describes the impacts of this senseless crime experienced by the victims family. Campbell, inspired by the Rodney King beating and the subsequent Los Angeles riots, wrote her second novel titled, \"Brothers and Sister\". This novel would be named as a \"The New York Times Magazine\" best seller just two weeks after its release in 1994. Campbell's interest in mental health was the catalyst for her first children's book, \"Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry\", which was published in September 2003. This book won the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Outstanding Literature Award for 2003. The book tells the story of how a little girl copes with being reared by her mentally ill mother. Ms. Campbell was a member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and a founding member of NAMI-Inglewood. Her book \"72 Hour Hold\" also deals with mental illness.

Rarely performing in big venues, they have visited several big international music festivals, and surprisingly to many, even large heavy metal festivals e.g. Wacken Open Air and Tuska Open Air. They travel mostly on a private lorry and no bus.\n\nEläkeläiset mainly play cover versions of famous pop and rock hits in a fast humppa or slow jenkka style (both sound somewhat similar to polka music the way \"Weird Al\" Yankovic plays it) with Finnish lyrics — the original songs are barely recognizable.

The 1st XV play in Southern Counties North. The club is located in the village of Sonning, on the outskirts of Reading. The 1st XV is coached by Ben Wills, assisted by defence coach Gareth Williams, 2nd XV coach Jack Lynch and 3rd XV coach Gareth Tully. The coaching team is headed up by Director of Rugby Andrew Arter\n\nReading was originally formed as 'Berkshire Wanderers' in July 1898 when RFU President Roger Walker, RFU Secretary George Rowland Hill and Cambridge Blue G R Joyce held a meeting in Pangbourne. Their aim was to set up a rugby club in Reading and the first game was played at the County Cricket Ground, Kensington Road, in September 1898. The club led a nomadic existence until, shortly before World War II, they moved to their present headquarters at Holme Park, Sonning. The club's name was changed to Reading in 1956 and the first trophy was won in 1970 when Marlow were beaten 16–3 at Maidenhead in the inaugural Berkshire Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1970s, Reading went into decline as Maidenhead and then Abbey became predominant in Berkshire. However, a successful colts side, organised by the late John Silverthorne, formed the basis of a revival following a disastrous 1982–83 season in which only one game was won.\n\nCoach Jeff Owen and skipper Ian Turrell joined forces in the early 1980s and through their emphasis on forward power, Reading became known as \"The Green Machine\". The Berkshire Cup was won for the second time in 1986 and then regularly until the Wanderers – the 2nd XV – won it for a record tenth time, beating Bracknell in the final. The Southern Merit Table was also won six times in less than a decade. In the 1986–87 season, the team won 30 out of 34 matches and also reached the third round of the John Player Cup, running Coventry, then amongst the country's elite, very close before going down 26–12.\n\nWhen the leagues started in 1987, Reading were placed in South West Division Two and lost their first-ever league game at home to Berry Hill. Nevertheless, they finished second in the league and were promoted. Three successive promotions under Mike Tewkesbury's guidance from 1992–93 took Reading into the country's top thirty teams. Reading played five seasons at this level, peaking at a final position of 6th, but by the time Tewkesbury left in 1999 problems were already apparent, as successive financial cuts had depleted the squad. Successive relegations took the side back into South West Division One.\n\nHowever, with Alastair McHarg and Dick Michael at the helm, steady progress was made over the next three seasons, culminating in promotion to National Division 3 South in 2004. The 2004–05 season started badly, with defeat in the hot sunshine at Hertford, but it ended entertainingly with a 50–28 win against old rivals Lydney and a creditable sixth place. The 2005–06 season started in much the same way with early defeats and many team changes due to injuries. However, there was no revival after Christmas as opportunities were missed in consecutive weeks for wins over Rosslyn Park and Southend which saw Reading return to South West Division 1. The worst moments for the team and supporters were the defeats at relegation rivals Bracknell and Old Patesians.\n\nThe 2006–07 season saw an end of season upsurge in form with Reading finishing safely fifth in the table. McHarg said that \"We've been playing with a lot of passion and commitment. The players have lifted themselves – they've stuck together and done exceptionally well.\"\n\nThe 2007–08 season saw them relegated to South West Division Two where they were originally placed when leagues started in 1987.\n\nThe 2008–09 season saw them promoted again but this was short lived as they were relegated once more in season 2009–10.\n\nThe 2009–10 season has the team finishing 5th in the South West 1 East Division.\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw another mid table finish of 6th place.\n\n1st team:\n\n2nd team:\n\n4th team:\n\nThe first team squad is amateur, the club also field a 2nd (Wanderers), 3rd (Vikings) & 5th (Saxons) team. The club have an over-35s squad (4th team), the \"Rhinos\".\n\n\"2019-20\"\n\n\"Reading Ladies\" are now a well-established team, playing regular Sunday fixtures against teams throughout the region. On 2 January 2008, a combined Berkshire and Buckinghamshire side played Canada U19s at RRFC. The half-time score was 19–5 to the visitors with the Canadian women's under-19 side eventually winning 41–5.\n\nReading under-15s girls and under-18s girls make up most of the Berkshire County sides and recently have had two England International girls and one Scotland International girl making the squads from Reading RFC.\n\nIn 2014–15 the under-18 Berkshire Barbarians girls side (combined Newbury RFC & Reading RFC) won the National 15's title as well as the Wasp's 10's Worthing 10's and National 7's titles\n\nIn 2016 The Berkshire Barbarians became just Reading & Newbury girls and then in Sep 2017 the cluster fully split leaving Reading RFC as a standalone girls club. In 2018-19 the U18 Team won the Area2 Cup by beating London Scottish U18 Girls making it the national Semi finals where they lost to Pulborough the eventual winners. The U15 team were beaten at the Area Semi Final stage. At the 2019 Worthing 10's the U15's were runners up to OA's and the U18's won the cup narrowly beating Dorchester.\n\n2 U18 players represented England U18 Girls vs Emerging Wales during 2019 and past players played for several Tyrell's Premiership teams.\n\nReading have seen a resurgence in youth rugby in recent years and now have representative teams in all age categories. Youth rugby is played on Sunday mornings. Reading also have two very successful girls teams at under-15s and under-18s and a very successful senior ladies side.\n\nReading Rugby Club also has the highest level of RFU accreditation with the RFU Whole Club Seal of Approval award on top of its Mini/Midi Seal of Approval Level 3, along with Club Mark and Sport England.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 27, 2000. In the episode, after getting his face censored out on the Duff Beer calendar for not being photogenic, Moe Szyslak gets plastic surgery and becomes the star of a popular soap opera.\n\nAfter being tricked into evacuating the house by Homer, who had set off the fire alarm early in the morning, the family goes to a festival sponsored by Duff Beer. While there, they see Moe Szyslak enter a \"Beer-tender\" competition. Moe wins the contest during the \"Toss Your Drunk\" challenge and gets his photo taken for a calendar, only to have it censored out with stickers. Realizing this is because of how ugly he is, Lenny and Carl suggest that Moe gets plastic surgery. He agrees, but is reluctant while there. After his surgery, Moe has a very handsome face. Vindicated, he confronts old adversaries, including the producers of a soap opera, \"It Never Ends\", complaining that he never got the part of Dr. Tad Winslow because of his ugliness. When the actor portraying the role is fired after demanding a salary increase, the producers hire Moe to replace him.\n\nMeanwhile, while Moe is acting, Bart and Lisa discover that Maggie's Duff Days elephant balloon has blown away in the wind. They go after it until it ends up in a gay Republican coalition's office where the members are discussing what their mascot should be, one member dismisses the pink elephant as being too \"on the nose\". They then give Lisa a bumper sticker telling her to vote for \"A Gay President in 2084\", to which they say \"we're realistic\" when Lisa appears puzzled.\n\nTaping of \"It Never Ends\" goes well until Moe reads in a top-secret book of future plot lines that his character is to be killed off. Infuriated, he gets revenge by revealing all the plots on the air, with help from Homer. The producer angrily interrupts to tell Moe that his character's death was meant to be part of a dream sequence, as indicated by the book's color-coding of pages that Moe had remembered incorrectly, and fires him. Moe confidently states that he can get a role on any other soap opera he wants, but as he is leaving, a set piece falls on his face and crushes it back to its original appearance. His life returns to normal at the bar, but his musings about why the accident left him with his original face instead of an entirely new one are quickly cut off by the ending credits.\n\n\"Pygmoelian\" was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Mark Kirkland as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000).\n\nIn a 2007 article, \"Slant\" critic Ed Gonzales noted that in relation to the episode's primary story of Moe's plastic surgery, the subplot of Bart and Lisa chasing Maggie's pink elephant balloon into a meeting for gay Republicans serves as \"a seemingly arbitrary bit of nonsense that connects succinctly with the theme of identity in which a person changes their face only to realize the efficiency of their old one.\"\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 27, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Larry Doyle, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nReception of the episode from critics has been generally positive. \n\nEd Gonzales of \"Slant\" called it a \"great episode.\" \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \"peaks early, as the scenes at 'Duff Days' provide the most amusement.\" He added that \"It’s nice to see a focus on Moe for once, but the tale itself fails to really ignite. Though not a poor episode, it’s pretty flat after the opening.\" \n\nIn 2009, writers for IGN listed a line by Moe from this episode among their top eight favorite Moe quotes. The line was \"Yeah, hey, I've got a gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching and I... the feeling is indescribable.\" Homer responds to this by saying \"I know what you mean. Our dog had that.\" The IGN writers commented that \"We've never heard anyone describe their life's passion as a parasitic infestation, and we hope we never have to. The cherry on top of this little nugget of Moe goodness is Homer's nonchalant reaction. He's probably used to Moe's strange, gross remarks by now.\"\n\nIn his review of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", Den of Geek critic Mark Oakley wrote that the \"cobbled-together feel to the series stops it from reaching the heights of a few years before.\" Oakley blamed this on lazy writing, and added that \"Proof of this comes when, on more than once occasion, the scripts include get-out clauses for the ridiculous storylines being churned out.\" He gave \"Pygmoelian\" as an example, commenting: \"Moe has cosmetic surgery. However, at the show’s end his more familiar face is suddenly returned to him following an accident and the fact that this happens without horrendously disfiguring him is pondered upon by Moe himself as the credits roll. Playing this card once might be funny, but after three or four times it’s just plain lazy.\"\n\n"}

It was the first major conflict to occur following the Battle of Wuhan.\n\nAfter the capture of Wuhan by the Japanese, Wuhan became the base of the Eleventh Army of the Imperial Japanese Army, in the former location of the Fifth and Ninth War Zones of the National Revolutionary Army. Nanchang was a railway hub and the western terminus of the Chekiang-Hunan Railway, being a major supply line between the Third and Ninth War Zones. In addition, it was the location of airfields that threatens shipping routes along the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Nationalist government reorganized the chain of command in the Ninth War Zone, with Chen Cheng remaining in the nominal post while Xue Yue was assigned to conduct the actual operations. Shortly before the beginning of the campaign, the Chinese forces amassed 200,000 troops from 52 divisions near Nanchang, but due to logistics the reorganization were largely ineffective.\n\nBack in July 1938, Japanese troops had attempted to approach Nanchang during their assault on Wuhan, but their advance were stopped by the Chinese defenders at the Xiushui River. The Chinese positions were well entrenched, blocking the path to Nanchang for the Japanese troops. For the rest of the year, the stalemate continued as both sides remained standstill on each side of the river.\n\nIn the spring of 1939, the Japanese troops with their new reinforcements began their new offensive toward Nanchang. On 20 March, the Japanese troops under the direct command of Yasuji Okamura launched heavy artillery shelling over Chinese fortifications on the other side of the Xiushui River. The Japanese sappers under the cover of artillery fire were able to set up bridges quickly which allowed the Japanese tanks to be deployed across the river, decimating the Chinese forces in the process. Two days later, the strategic location of Wucheng, located at where Xiushui River enters Poyang Lake, sustained heavy naval bombardment and airstrikes by the Japanese navy and fell shortly after to the Special Naval Landing Forces on 23 March.\n\nIn addition to conventional artillery fire, the Japanese bombardment also utilized toxic gas produced by Unit 731, which had been deployed occasionally in the China field of operations.\n\nThe Japanese Army used the \"6th Field Heavy Artillery Brigade\" artillery unit under the command of Major Gen. Sumita. This force consisted of the following artillery sections:\n\n\nBy 26 March, the Japanese troops supported by tanks had broken out of their Xiushui River bridgehead and reached the west gate of Nanchang, defeating Chinese reinforcements from the Third War Zone. Yasuji Okamura's troops were joined by another Japanese regiment striking south from the north of Nanchang, and the converged Japanese forces began surrounding and laying siege to the city. The city of Nanchang fell the next day, with the Chinese defenders suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese Army continued to clear out the rural area throughout March and April, marking the end of the first phase of the campaign.\n\nDespite of losing the city of Nanchang to the Japanese, Chinese forces in Jiangxi continues to make a stand. During a period lasting until the end of April some Japanese forces were moved to support operations in other areas (see Battle of Suizao). The Chinese Nationalists saw an opportunity in this weakening of available Japanese manpower, and planned a counterattack to retake the city. Their directive was to cut off the Japanese contact and disrupt the enemy from the rear.\n\nOn 21 April, a surprise attack by the forces of the Third and Ninth War Zones began from the north, west, and south of Nanchang. It began with the 1st Army Group in the 60th Army Division as well as the 58th Army Division attacking from the North. They were later joined by the 74th and 49th Army Groups as they pushed in through Japanese defenses. In the south, this sudden offensive quickly broke through the Japanese positions as they advanced towards Nanchang proper. After five days of relentless advancement, the 32nd Army Group at the front of the Southern Chinese spearhead reached the outer area of Nanchang. Throughout the Chinese attack, the Japanese still retained control over the Xiushui River and continually received supplies and reinforcements throughout the five-day advance of Chinese troops.\n\nBeginning on 27 April, the Japanese began a counteroffensive against the Chinese push by attacking the southern troops. Supported by heavy artillery fire, and air support the Japanese retook several of their strongholds around the city and forced the Chinese divisions to fall back. For the following week, progress was at a standstill on both sides as they held their defensive positions. Hoping to end the conflict quickly, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chinese divisions surrounding Nanchang on 2 May to retake the city by 5 May.\n\nFollowing this order, the Chinese launched a new offensive to try to end the conflict over the city, but the continued reinforcements of the Japanese were unable to be pushed back. After several days of intense fighting, and heavy casualties for the Chinese army, the Chinese were exhausted and forced to retreat on 9 May. Also exhausted from the battle, the Japanese did not pursue the retreating Chinese army.\n\nCasualties for the fighting around Nanchang have been reported as 51,328 killed or wounded for the Chinese, and 24,000 for the Japanese. After the fall of Nanchang, the Japanese consolidated their control of Jiangxi and Hunan region. The Nationalists however continued to maintain their presence in the area. The Japanese momentum were further interrupted by the border clashes with the Soviet Union, which broke out shortly after in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.\n\n\n"}

It is council #072 and serves 37 towns and cities in Connecticut, located in Fairfield County, New Haven County, and parts of Hartford County.\n\nThe present council was formed in 1998 by the merger of Quinnipiac Council (#74) and Fairfield County Council (#68).\n\nOwaneco Lodge is the Order of the Arrow lodge that serves this council.\n\nConnecticut Yankee Council is divided into the following districts:\n\n\nConnecticut Yankee Council operates five camps: Camp Sequassen in New Hartford, Deer Lake Scout Reservation in Killingworth, Hoyt Scout Reservation in Redding, Camp Pomperaug in Union, and Wah Wah Taysee in North Haven.\n\nCamp Sequassen is located in New Hartford, Connecticut. It is a Boy Scout camp operated by the Connecticut Yankee Council and is mainly used for summer camp. During the summer, it becomes a Scouts BSA resident camp for over 2,000 youth from across New England. The camp was moved to this new site in 1927 with the purchase of 125 acres. Today the camp consists of 540 acres of forest and over 2500' of shoreline on West Hill Pond. Troops from around Connecticut and neighboring states stay at Camp Sequassen for a week. While staying there, Scouts are able to work on rank requirements and take merit badge classes while being instructed by well-trained staff members.\n\nOne of these places is the Trading Post. This is a small Scouting store operated by Sequassen staff. It is well known for the slushies and candy sold there, but also offers other merchandise such as Sequassen frisbees, shirts, hats, belts, walking sticks, joke books, cookbooks, songbooks, knives, playing cards, bumper stickers, mugs, water bottles, carabiners and patches as well as official Boy Scout Merit Badge books and socks. At the waterfront, Scouts can go swimming or take boats such as canoes, kayaks and row boats out into West Hill Pond. Also, Platt Field, located in North Sequassen, is where Scouts can participate in rifle shooting, paintball, and archery (both trap shooting and regular). Very close to Platt Field, shotgun shooting is available for older Scouts near Scout Craft. There is also a handicrafts center near the waterfront where woodcarving, photography and metalwork is possible. At the Nature Center called \"Eco\" (located on the right side of Cohen Lodge), Scouts can enjoy creative, fun and educational programs such as catching insects at the \"Bug Wall,\" testing their knowledge in \"Eco Jeopardy\", and going on an astronomy hike up to Platt Field. Scouts can also play exciting games such as quidditch, gaga ball, and disc golf in the nearby Clark Field. At the end of the week all Scouts can participate in the camp-wide \"Land and Sea Games.\"\n\nNo one is allowed to cross over West Hill Road to get from one half of the camp to the other. Instead, all Scouts, staff and adult leaders use the Godfrey-Morris tunnel that goes under West Hill Road.\nJohn Sherman Hoyt Scout Reservation and Training Center is located in Redding, Connecticut. The reservation was donated to the Alfred W. Dater Council by Alice B. Sanford in 1966. The of wooded property is located in a rural area of Connecticut on the western end of the Connecticut Yankee Council. The camp consists of 173 acres. When the Hoyt training center is mentioned in the presence of Connecticut Yankee Council members, it is often repeated by members of the audience who reply \"HOYT!\".\n\nThe reservation is named after John Sherman Hoyt of Darien, Connecticut. Hoyt was a wealthy industrialist and dedicated Scouter. Hoyt was involved with the Scouting movement since 1910 as one of its founders and later served as National Council Vice President for Finance, a member of the National Council Executive Board and Advisory Board. Hoyt donated of land in 1947 to the Alfred W. Dater Council, which became the Five Mile River Camp. The first building built at the new camp was a training cabin, which was dedicated to Major General Arthur Carter.\n\nThe reservation has been operated by three different councils. Alfred W. Dater Council merged to form Fairfield County Council in 1972 and merged again in 1998 to form the present Connecticut Yankee Council.\n\nThis is a Scout camp located in Union, Connecticut. The CT Burn Foundation uses the facility as a summer camp for children with severe burns. This camp has had a long history, first, as Boy Scout camp located on Lake Zoar as part of the Housatonic River system.\n\nDeer Lake Scout Reservation is located on Deer Lake in Killingworth, Connecticut, and covers 253 acres. It was originally owned by Central Connecticut Council until the merger with Quinnipiac Council. It is home to the Connecticut Yankee Council's Cub Scout Summer Resident Camp and Family Camp programs.\n\nWah Wah Taysee is located partly in North Haven and partly in Hamden. The land was donated to the Quinnipiac Council in 1971 by the late Ned Greist. According to the attorney who drafted the deed, Mr. Greist chose the name 'Wah Wah Taysee' for the campsite, which he said was the name of the firefly in the poem Hiawatha. The property is situated near the base of Sleeping Giant, a.k.a. Mt. Carmel. Mr. Greist's family was one of several families instrumental in earlier successful efforts to save the area from aggressive quarrying, and devoting it to what is now the Sleeping Giant Park. Mr. Greist was an avid hiker and an active volunteer in the Scout movement. He was also the President of the Sleeping Giant Park Association for several years.\n\nOwaneco Lodge is the Order of the Arrow (OA) lodge for the Connecticut Yankee Council. The Order of the Arrow is Scouting's National Honor Society. The lodge's name comes from a chief’s name of the Mohegan Tribe and its totem is Owaneco.\n\nThe council was formed in 1998 by the merger of the Quinnipiac Council, which hosted the Arcoon Lodge; and the Fairfield County Council, which hosted the Tankiteke Lodge. When it was announced in 1998 that Arcoon and Tankiteke would merge to form a new lodge in 1999, a steering committee was set up to discuss the merger between the two lodges. After five meetings between February and September 1998, all details regarding basic structure, committee responsibilities, name of the lodge, bylaws and first lodge event were discussed and finalized.\n\nOn October 4, 1998, the first meeting of the memberships of Owaneco Lodge occurred. The lodge membership approved the lodge name, number, bylaws and the first group of lodge officers was elected. During the lodge’s first year, the executive committee worked to mold the new lodge program. Several changes were made to combine the traditions of Tankiteke and Arcoon and adapt a new lodge program. In 1998 the Ockenuck Chapter renamed itself to the Arcoon Chapter.\n\nDuring 1999, Owaneco lodge achieved honor lodge status for the first time in its short history. Owaneco repeated this achievement in 2007.\n\nThe 2003 Section NE-2A Conclave was held at Camp Sequassen and hosted by Owaneco Lodge.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Dancers, which started out as the Wulihan Chapter Dance Team in the Arcoon Lodge, celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2014. The dance team has garnered dozens of awards.\n\nOwaneco Lodge actively practices the OA principles of Cheerful Service. For many years, the lodge is engaged in collecting soda can tabs for donation to the Masonic Tabs for Tots program, which uses the tabs to raise funds for the Shriner Hospitals for Crippled Children and Burn Victims. In 2011, Owaneco donated close to 100 pounds of tabs to the Connecticut Masonic Scouters Association.\n\n\n"}

The musical's script and lyrics are by Marsha Norman, with music by Lucy Simon. It premiered on Broadway in 1991 and ran for 709 performances.\n\nThe story is set in the early years of the 20th century. Mary Lennox, a young English girl born and raised in the British Raj, is orphaned by a cholera outbreak when she is ten years old. She is sent away from India to live in the manor of a brooding uncle she has never met in Yorkshire, England, where her personality blossoms among the other residents of the manor as they bring new life to a long-neglected garden.\nThe musical had its world premiere at the Wells Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia, in a Virginia Stage Company production, running from November 28, 1989 to December 17, 1989. Direction was by R.J. Cutler, with scenic design by Heidi Landesman, lighting by Peter Kaczorowski and costumes by Martin Pakledinaz.\n\n\"The Secret Garden\" premiered on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on April 25, 1991, and closed on January 1993, after 709 performances. The musical was directed by Susan H. Schulman with choreography by Michael Lichtefeld.

It won the 1991 Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Daisy Eagan), and Best Scenic Design (Heidi Landesman). Eagan at age 11 was the youngest female recipient of a Tony Award. The set resembled an enormous Victorian toy theatre with pop-out figures, large paper dolls, and Joseph Cornell-like collage elements. Costumes were by Theoni V. Aldredge, who was nominated for the Tony Award, Best Costume Design.\n\nThe wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\nThe musical was produced in Australia in 1995 in Brisbane (opened on 27 July 1995), Sydney (opened on 7 September 1995), and Melbourne (opened on 20 December 1995).

The production has revisions which include new songs, deletions (including the songs \"Round-Shouldered Man\", \"Quartet\", \"Race You to the Top of the Morning\") and re-arranging, but overall it condenses and streamlines the story to a shorter running time under Norman and Simon's involvement. In early 2017, it was announced that the production would transfer onto Broadway. The production performed at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle from April 14 to May 6, 2017 and at the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston,Texas from October 10–22, 2017, and had plans to go to other theatres across North America before going to Broadway; however, the production's timeline has since been canceled.\n\nOn February 12, 2018, it was announced that the first Broadway revival will be presented during the 2018-2019 season.

A lab production will be held from May 19, 2018 to June 8 prior to the Broadway revival, directed by Warren Carlyle. Taking part in the developmental production are, among others, Sierra Boggess as Lily, Matt Doyle as Albert, Drew Gehling as Neville, Clifton Duncan as Archibald and Brooklyn Shuck as Mary. The revival did not come to pass in the 2018-2019 season and there has been no further word on the project. When Warren Carlyle was interviewed by Ken Davenport for The Producer's Perspective Podcast in May 2019, he revealed that the revival is still on the table. They have a cast lined up, they're just waiting for the right theatre to be available.\n\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Opera Australia and the Gordon Frost Organisation would stage the 25th anniversary production, again directed by Susan H. Schulman, opening in Sydney in August 2020, with a Melbourne season to follow. It was also further announced that Anthony Warlow would be reprising his role as Archibald Craven. \n\n\"The Secret Garden\" was The Third Annual World AIDS Day Benefit Concert, held on December 5, 2005, at the Manhattan Center Studios Grand Ballroom, New York City, directed by Stafford Arima and produced by Jamie McGonnigal. The cast featured Laura Benanti as Lily, Steven Pasquale as Archie, Will Chase as Neville, Celia Keenan-Bolger as Martha, David Canary as Ben, Jaclyn Neidenthal as Mary, Struan Erlenborn as Colin, Max von Essen as Albert, Sara Gettelfinger as Rose, and Michael Arden as Dickon. The cast also included Matt Cavenaugh, Jenny Powers, Ben Magnuson, Shonn Wiley, Reshma Shetty, Deborah S. Craig, Nehal Joshi, and Kate Shindle, with Barbara Rosenblat returning to the role she created, Mrs. Medlock.\n\nManhattan Concert Productions presented a concert production of \"The Secret Garden\" at Lincoln Center for two nights on February 21 and 22, 2016, with Sydney Lucas starring as Mary Lennox. She was joined by the original \"Mary Lennox\", Daisy Eagan, who now plays the role of Martha, and Barbara Rosenblat, returning to her original role of Mrs. Medlock. Also in the cast were Ramin Karimloo as Archibald Craven, Sierra Boggess as Lily, Cheyenne Jackson as Neville Craven, Ben Platt as Dickon, Jere Shea as Ben, Oscar Williams as Colin Craven, Nikki Renée Daniels as Rose, Josh Young as Captain Albert Lennox and Telly Leung as Fakir.\n\nRebecca Luker (the original Lily) appeared in a benefit concert for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Metro New York and Western New York at the Lucille Lortel Theatre on January 11, 2016. The concert was originally scheduled to be one night only, but a second performance was added for January 17, 2016. Daisy Eagan, the original \"Mary Lennox\" was the host for the concerts.\n\n\"The Secret Garden\" (in concert) was presented in Toronto, Canada, in January 2017 as the inaugural show of a newly formed theatre company Podium Concert Productions, headed by Producer Peter da Costa and Conductor Mark Camilleri.\n\nIn February 2019, \"The Secret Garden\" was presented by the Virginia Stage Company in the Norfolk Botanical Gardens in a concert to celebrate the Company's 40th anniversary. This was the first time that \"The Secret Garden\" has been staged there since the World Premiere in 1989.\n\nThis synopsis describes the original Broadway production; the reworked London production altered this sequence by moving or omitting several scenes and songs.\n\nMary Lennox, a 10-year-old English girl who has lived in India since birth, dreams of English nursery rhymes and Hindi chants (\"Opening\"). She awakes to learn that her parents and nearly everyone she knew in India, including her Ayah, have died of cholera. She is discovered by survivors of the epidemic (\"There's a Girl\"). \n\nMary is sent to live in England with her mysterious uncle Archibald Craven, a reclusive hunchback who has spent years grieving the death of his wife, Lily. Due to Archibald's introversion, the management of his manor house, Misselthwaite, is largely left to his manipulating brother, Dr. Neville Craven. The housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, coldly welcomes Mary to Yorkshire on her arrival (\"The House Upon the Hill\"). Due to Archibald and Mary's lingering grief, the house is haunted by ghosts from their pasts (identified in the libretto as \"dreamers\" who sometimes act as a Greek chorus of narrators). Lonely and misbehaving, Mary despises her new surroundings and has difficulty sleeping her first night there, hearing echoes of crying voices (\"I Heard Someone Crying\"). The next morning, Mary meets Martha, a young chambermaid who encourages Mary to go play outside by telling her about the surrounding moorland and grounds (\"If I Had a Fine White Horse\"), in particular, a hidden garden. Archibald does not meet Mary, but remains submerged in his ghostly memories of Lily (\"A Girl In the Valley\").\n\nMary explores the walled garden, laid out in Victorian style as a topiary maze, where she encounters the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff and Martha's brother Dickon (\"It's a Maze\"). Ben tells Mary that the secret garden has been locked since Lily's death, as it reminds Archibald of her. The mystical Dickon invokes the spring (\"Winter's On the Wing\") in a rustic druid-like fashion; he claims to converse with animals and teaches Mary to speak the Yorkshire dialect to a robin, which guides Mary to the garden's secret key (\"Show Me the Key\"). \n\nArchibald and Mary finally meet, and Mary asks him for nothing but a bit of earth to plant a garden of her own; he is startled by the simple modesty of the request and compares her to Lily for their shared horticultural interests (\"A Bit of Earth\"). As the Yorkshire gloom turns to a fearsome storm (\"Storm I\"), Archibald and his brother Neville both notice that Mary shares physical resemblances to her aunt Lily, with whom both men were in love (\"Lily's Eyes\"). Mary again hears crying (\"Storm II\"), but this time she uncovers its source: Colin, a secret cousin of hers confined to bed since his birth, when his mother Lily died. Colin has been in bed his entire life because Archibald, his father, feared that Colin would also become a hunchback, likely influenced by Neville's deceptive medical advice. Colin confides in Mary his nightly dreams of a man who comes to him and reads from a magical book (\"A Round-Shouldered Man\"). However, just as Mary and Colin embrace their new yearned-for companionship, Neville and Mrs. Medlock burst in and angrily tell her she is never to see Colin again because of his fragile medical condition. As the storm reaches its peak, Mary runs outside and, discovering the hidden door to the garden, she inserts the key (\"Final Storm\").\n\nMary has a reverie about the exciting new privacy afforded to her by the garden (\"The Girl I Mean to Be\"). Much like both Mary's uncle and Mary herself, the garden is neglected and half-wild. Neville's musings are darker: recalling his unrequited love for Lily, Neville wants Archibald to leave Misselthwaite entirely to him. The two brothers' thoughts are interwoven with ghostly echoes of old arguments between Lily and her sister Rose (Mary's mother) about Archibald's suitability as a prospective husband and father (\"Quartet\"). At Neville's urging, the melancholy Archibald leaves for Paris, pausing only to warmly read a fairy tale to Colin as the boy sleeps (\"Race You To the Top of the Morning\"). Thus, the \"round-shouldered man\" is not a dream at all but merely Colin's own father, who, despite his emotional devastation, still deeply loves his son.\n\nMary asks Dickon for help with the garden, which seems dead; Dickon explains that it is probably just dormant and that, with some assistance, it will grow (\"Wick\"). Mary tells Colin about the discovered garden, but he is initially reluctant to go outside until encouraged by an inviting vision of his mother (\"Come to My Garden/Lift Me Up\"). Mary, Dickon, and Martha clandestinely bring Colin to the garden in a wheelchair. In the garden, the exercise, fresh air, and magical incantations in both Hindi and English led by Mary, the ghosts, and the manor staff strengthen Colin, allowing him to rise from his wheelchair for the first time (\"Come Spirit, Come Charm\"), as the onlookers sing the praises of the renewed garden (\"A Bit of Earth (Reprise)\").\n\nBack in the house, Neville faces down Mary as he threatens to send her away to boarding school, culminating in a violent confrontation between the doctor and the girl. Immediately after, Martha soothes Mary, telling her to stay strong (\"Hold On\"). With Martha's help, Mary writes to Archibald in Paris (\"Letter Song\"), urging him to come home. Archibald's emotional turmoil continues to dominate him (\"Where In the World\"); however, Lily's ghost reappears in order to convince him, at last, to return to the neglected Colin and Mary (\"How Could I Ever Know\"). Arriving home, he enters the garden to find Colin completely healthy; in fact, he is beating Mary in a footrace as Archibald walks through the door. Archibald, a changed man, sends Neville away to his Paris flat and triumphantly embraces Mary and Colin back into his life. The spirits of Mary's parents, Albert and Rose, along with Lily, promise to look over the living for the rest of their days (\"Finale\").\n\nBurnett's novel primarily focused on Mary and her interactions with Colin, Martha, and Dickon. The musical adds more emphasis to the adult characters by presenting (and to some extent, inventing) the shared history entwining the two families. Originally, Burnett stated that the name of Archibald's wife was Lilias, and that she was the sister of Mary Lennox's father; in the musical, Colin's and Mary's mothers are sisters named Lily and Rose respectively.\n\nIn the book, Colin's private physician is an otherwise unnamed poor cousin of Archibald Craven; Colin privately remarks to Mary that Dr. Craven is the next heir to Misselthwaite and \"always looks cheerful when [Colin's health] is worse\", but Burnett also states that Dr. Craven is \"not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let [Colin] run into actual danger.\" The musical tightens the doctor's conflict of interest and makes him the primary antagonist as Archibald's brother, Dr. Neville Craven, who once hopelessly loved Lily and whom Mary expressly accuses of wanting Colin to die for the sake of his inheritance.\n\nAct I\n\nAct II\n\nA full recording was made with the original Broadway cast, including all of the songs listed above as well as some interstitial material, and released on CD by Columbia Records in 1991 (catalog number CK 48817).\n\nAn eight-song \"highlights\" album with Fiddes, Ritchie, and the rest of the Australian cast was released on CD by Polydor Records Australia in 1995 (catalog number 579 997-2).\n\nThe original London production was partially reworked for production by the Royal Shakespeare Company, reducing the emphasis on the adult characters to return the plot closer to the original book. A full recording of this version was released on CD by First Night Records in 2001.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901752", "title": "Ray Rayner", "text": "Ray Rayner\n\nRay Rayner (born Raymond M. Rahner; July 23, 1919 – January 21, 2004) was an American television presenter, actor and author, he was the staple of Chicago children's television in the 1960s and 1970s on WGN-TV.\n\nRayner (the name was initially spelled \"Rahner\" but pronounced \"Rayner\") grew up in Queens, New York. He attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts; his first media job was working for WGBB radio in Freeport on Long Island while he was attending night school at Fordham University.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army Air Corps, serving as the navigator of a B-17 during World War II, when he was shot down over France April 3, 1943. During years as a POW in Stalag Luft III, he helped prepare the escape depicted in the film \"The Great Escape\"—though he was transferred to another camp before the escape took place. It was during his time as a POW that he discovered his talent for entertaining, namely through his fellow prisoners and his German captors. He was interviewed in a documentary titled \"Stalag Luft III\", produced by RDR Productions of Glenview, Illinois.\n\nAfter briefly working in radio at WOOD in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as well as in New York and Dayton, Ohio following the war, Rayner joined what was then WBKB, later to become WBBM-TV in Chicago as a staff announcer; he also worked on a local morning program called \"Rayner Shine\" in 1953. This was Rayner's first work with puppets, who were provided for the show by the Mulqueens. He got a noontime program called \"The Ray Rayner Show\" in 1953, he and his co-host Mina Kolb hosted a somewhat free-form show that featured music, comedy skits, dance and pantomime. The show, geared towards teens, ran for five years.\n\nWBBM asked Rayner to switch to a children's program in 1958, though reluctant at first, he did so with \"The Little Show\", which was very much like \"Ray Rayner and His Friends\"; on this version, the duck he worked with had the name of Havelock. It ran two years; he also hosted \"Popeye's Firehouse\" (as Chief Abernathy) for another two. He moved to WGN-TV in 1961.\n\nHis first role on WGN was as Sergeant Pettibone, the host of the \"Dick Tracy\" show. He joined the cast of \"Bozo's Circus\" as country bumpkin clown Oliver O. Oliver. By 1965, Rayner's clown character, along with \"Sandy\", played by Don Sandburg, were added to Larry Harmon's Bozo coloring books. Rayner left the show in 1971 because he wanted more time for other projects. After that, he occasionally appeared on the show as Oliver and filled in for Ned Locke as \"Mr. Ray\" when needed. Following the cancellation of \"Dick Tracy\", a new afternoon program called \"Rocket to Adventure\" ran until 1968; this featured early appearances by Gigantor and Tobor the Eighth Man. Rayner hosted the show appearing as an astronaut. In 1968, he also appeared in television commercials for McDonald's as Ronald McDonald. At one point, WGN-TV had enough hope in being able to syndicate Rayner's Dick Tracy show to produce a pilot for that purpose.\n\nStarting in 1962, Rayner began hosting his own long-running \"Ray Rayner and His Friends\", which had the title \"Breakfast With Bugs Bunny\" when he became its host; it was renamed in 1964. The show featured old cartoons such as various Warner Brothers character cartoons, arts-and-crafts, which often ended up as a gluey mess, and animals such as Chelveston the Duck who was named after RAF Chelveston where Rayner was stationed during World War II. Chelveston occasionally bit and Rayner was notably wary. During these segments, Chelveston walked around the set, eat, or bathe while a then-current top 40 song was played. Rayner later said he put duck feed in the cuffs of his coveralls so Chelveston nipped at them, then save himself from the duck by giving him a head of lettuce to pick apart. What was not known to the public until after the program was no longer on the air was that Chelveston was actually played by four different ducks over the years.\n\nRayner also had a talking dog puppet, Cuddly Dudley, created and voiced by Roy Brown, a.k.a. \"Cooky the Cook\" from \"Bozo's Circus\" and \"The Bozo Show\". The segment highlighted viewer mail which included many hand-drawn pictures submitted by children. The segment was often humorous as it was a chance for Rayner and Brown to interact and use comedic ad-libs. He always wore a jumpsuit, covered with small pieces of paper that held reminders of what to do next on the program (a cartoon, a commercial, a visit from Chelveston, etc.). He would also simulcast traffic reports from sister station WGN Radio over stock footage of traffic moving along the Chicago-area Interstates. During baseball season, he showed and narrated highlights of the Cubs and White Sox games from the previous day, wearing a custom-sewn ball cap that had the front half of each team's cap, resulting in a two-billed cap which he spun around, depending on which team's highlights were being shown.\n\nThe arts-and-crafts was a regular segment that always began with a finished version prepared in advance by someone \"behind the scenes\" (who quite often was the wife of Producer Dick Flanders) that was displayed to the audience, followed by Rayner's attempts to demonstrate the process in an amusing, all-thumbs effort, also set to music, that resulted in a comically sub-par facsimile that more resembled a random collection of felt, construction paper and glue. Rayner's version would then be displayed alongside the original further emphasizing his comical ineptitude regarding crafts. Rayner contended that his failure at crafts made the show successful as the work of his young viewers was much better than the crafts he did on-air. He held an annual jellybean contest where viewers were to submit guesses of the quantity in a large jar displayed for a period of time on the show. Every Christmas he had an Advent calendar and would reveal a date each day until the Christmas holiday. Another bit was a lip-synching sketch Rayner usually did to an older novelty song such as \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\" by Allan Sherman. However he also performed serious songs while actually singing. Another feature on the show was \"Ark in the Park\", a taped segment of a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo featuring the then-director of the zoo, Dr. Lester Fisher. The introductory music for this segment was \"The Unicorn\" by The Irish Rovers. Rayner also featured a \"How and Why\" segment on his shows with J. Bruce Mitchell of Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, as did \"Garfield Goose and Friends\". Along with \"Bozo's Circus\", a video game was added to Rayner's show that viewers could play by phone called \"TV Powww\". Rayner hosted this show until his 1980 retirement from WGN.\n\nDuring his time at Channel 9, starting in 1974, Rayner also hosted a Thursday night broadcast of the Illinois State Lottery's then-weekly drawings, which featured a top prize of $300,000 (\"Weekly Bonanza\") and a second prize of $50,000 to a field of about a dozen contestants who had won a special lottery game over the preceding seven-day period. The show aired at 7:00 PM CT.\n\nDuring his years in Chicago, he also frequently appeared in live theater, including plays at the Forum Dinner Theater in suburban Summit; receiving a Jefferson award nomination for one of his roles. Rayner also did directing for student productions at Loyola University Chicago. He received an M. A. in Humanities from the University of Chicago in 1970, writing his thesis about children's television's first goal being to entertain. He was a member of the Silver Circle of the Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and received many local Emmys for his television work.\n\nRayner also wrote a book titled \"The Story of Television\" published in 1972. It is basically an industry guide to how a television show is made featuring many photos of Rayner from his \"Ray Rayner and Friends\" show. The book is quite rare and commands a high price, when available, from on-line auction sites. One copy was donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications about seven months after Rayner's passing.\n\nHe moved to KGGM-TV, the CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1981, before retiring from television in 1989. He cited the harsh Chicago winters as the motivating factor. Rayner was the station's weatherman, complete with notes pinned to his jacket as they were to his coveralls in Chicago; he also hosted the local \"PM Magazine\" in Albuquerque. He returned to Chicago for the 25th and 30th anniversary shows for \"Bozo's Circus\". Rayner continued to accept some Chicago theater roles and took some time to patiently answer children's questions about his work even after moving to Albuquerque. He did a week-long stint filling in at weather and other duties at Chicago's \"Fox Thing in the Morning\" on WFLD in May 1995. Rayner took some courses at the University of New Mexico, did some teaching and wrote a column for a local newspaper there.\n\nRayner moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after his wife, Jeanne, a former nurse, died of lung cancer in 1995. His activities there included reading to the blind, Grant A Wish (for terminally ill children), and delivering Meals on Wheels.\n\nHe died on 21 January 2004, of complications from pneumonia in Fort Myers, Florida, at the age of 84. He is survived by his second wife, Marie, a daughter and a son, and four grandchildren.\n\nClips from Rayner's shows are featured in the WGN Christmas special, \"\". In 2005, the Museum of Broadcast Communications awarded WGN-TV's Studio 1 a plaque to commemorate the forty years of children's television broadcast from the studio. \"Ray Rayner and Friends\" with a likeness of Rayner and Chelveston, is on the plaque along with Frazier Thomas and \"Garfield Goose and Friends\" and Bob Bell and \"Bozo's Circus\". Rayner's coveralls, complete with notes, is part of the museum's collection. Cuddly Dudley and his doghouse from \"The Bozo Show\" are also part of the museum's collection. A photo of Rayner on the set of his television show with two guests was chosen as the cover photo for \"Chicago Television\", published for the Museum of Broadcast Communications in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

Its full title is The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used as a Table (Phenomenologic Theory of Furniture-Nutrition). It makes reference to \"The Art of Painting\" by Johannes Vermeer, a famous seventeenth-century work in which a painter, thought to be a self-portrait of Vermeer, is depicted with his back to us, in distinctive costume. It is one of a number of paintings expressive of Dalí's enormous admiration for Vermeer.\n\nVermeer is represented as a dark spindly figure in a kneeling position. The figure's outstretched leg serves as a table top surface, on which sits a bottle and a small glass. This leg tapers to a baluster-like stub; there is a shoe nearby. The walls and the distant views of the mountains are based on real views near Dalí's home in Port Lligat. In Vermeer's painting the artist leans on a maulstick, and his hand is painted with an unusual blurriness, perhaps to indicate movement. In Dalí's painting Vermeer rests the same arm on a crutch.\n\nIt is unsigned and undated but known to have been completed c.1934. It is currently on display at the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, on loan from the E. and A. Reynolds Morse collection.\n\nAround 1934, Dalí produced several other works inspired by \"The Art of Painting\":\n\n\nDalí revered Vermeer, and also drew several times on his \"The Lacemaker\", for instance in \"Paranoiac-Critical Study of Vermeer's Lacemaker\". Dali also painted a copy of \"The Lacemaker\" on commission from collector Robert Lehman. \"The Ghost of Vermeer\" should also be seen in the context of his other reworkings of historic paintings, such as several works inspired by Millet's \"Angelus\". Images of anthropomorphic furniture as well as crutch-like objects are common in this period of his career.\n"}

After years of writing for the Christian right, he came out as gay in 1994 and devoted himself full-time to minister to lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people, also writing extensively on the subject of gay Christians.\n\nWhite was born in Santa Clara, California. In 1962, White graduated from Warner Pacific College. That same year, he married Lyla Lee Loehr. They had two children, one of whom is the actor/comedian and screenwriter Mike White.\n\nAfter receiving his BA from Warner Pacific College, then graduating with an MA in communications from the University of Portland, White followed with graduate work in communications and film at University of Southern California, UCLA, and Harvard. He received his Doctorate of Ministry from, and was a professor of communications and preaching for over a decade at Fuller Theological Seminary. During this time he also worked as an evangelical pastor.\n\nAfter their marriage, White admitted to his wife that he had always been attracted to men. He embarked on a long process of attempted cures for his homosexuality, including psychotherapy, prayer, electroconvulsive therapy, and exorcism. None of these techniques changed his attraction to men, and after he attempted suicide, he and his wife agreed to an amicable divorce. His son Mike is bisexual.\n\nIn 1984, White began dating Gary Nixon. In 1994, White wrote his autobiography, \"Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay And Christian In America\", which detailed his former career in the Religious Right and his struggle coming to terms with his sexuality.

{"id": "1901773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901773", "title": "Drapier's Letters", "text": "Drapier's Letters\n\nDrapier's Letters is the collective name for a series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the \"Drapier's Letters\". Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym \"M. B., Drapier\", to hide from retaliation.\n\nAlthough the letters were condemned by the Irish government, with prompting from the British government, they were still able to inspire popular sentiment against Wood and his patent. The popular sentiment turned into a nationwide boycott, which forced the patent to be withdrawn; Swift was later honoured for this service to the people of Ireland. Many Irish people recognised Swift as a hero for his defiance of British control over the Irish nation. Beyond being a hero, many critics have seen Swift, through the persona of the Drapier, as the first to organise a \"more universal Irish community\", although it is disputed as to who constitutes that community. Regardless of to whom Swift is actually appealing what he may or may not have done, the nickname provided by Archbishop King, \"Our Irish Copper-Farthen Dean\", and his connection to ending the controversy stuck.\n\nThe first complete collection of the \"Drapier's Letters\" appeared in the 1734 George Faulkner edition of the \"Works\" of Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people. Today, the \"Drapier's Letters\" are an important part of Swift's political writings, along with \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726), \"A Tale of a Tub\" (1704), and \"A Modest Proposal\" (1729).\n\nIn 1722, hardware manufacturer William Wood was granted letters patent to produce copper coinage of up to £108,000 (around £ as of 2020) for use in Ireland. The patent was secured by a bribe of £10,000 (around £ as of 2020) to the Duchess of Kendal, mistress to King George I. Although Wood's copper coins were subsequently alleged to be underweight, undersized, and made from inferior materials, assays had found they were not so, prior to their approval by the British Parliament for use in Ireland.\n\nThe Irish complaint against Wood was not that they had enough copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, no way existed for the Irish to control the quality and amount. Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a way to express their economic-nationalist desires.\n\nThe patent issue soon became a struggle between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (with the authority of the British Parliament) and the leaders of Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the Church of Ireland to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.\n\nDuring this time, Lord Carteret, the British Secretary of State whose remit included Ireland, publicly pushed Walpole into defending Wood's patent. However, Carteret privately attempted to destroy the patent to damage Walpole's reputation. Thus, Carteret appeared to the British as a defender of the patent because he seemingly tried to prevent an Irish uprising against British rule (especially by finding the \"Drapier\"), but he was really furthering his anti-Walpole agenda and aiding the Irish cause.\n\nJonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, was already known for his concern for the Irish people and for writing several political pamphlets. One of these, \"Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture\" (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. Also, the Irish authorities knew that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, and that he would use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.\nSwift analysed the forensic and economic disadvantages of Wood's inferior coinage and the effects it would have over Ireland in the first of the pamphlets, \"A Letter to the Shop-keepers\" (1724). In the pamphlet, Swift adopted the persona of the \"Drapier\": a common Irishman, a talented and skilled draper, a religiously devout individual who believes in scripture, and a man loyal to both the Church of Ireland and to the King of Ireland. Swift's pseudonymous choice served two essential purposes: it provided him with an alternate persona which he could use to hide from potential political reprisals, and it allowed him to create an identity that was closely aligned with the common people of Ireland.\n\nAccording to 20th-century Swift scholar Irvin Ehrenpreis, debate arose in the academic community over how much Swift may have wished his audience to identify him as the Drapier, especially since the Drapier constantly includes religious imagery that was common to Swift's sermons. However, the religious rhetoric probably used to justify an Irish rebellion against the coinage is merely meant as an important aspect of the Drapier's identity without it being meant as evidence that Swift was the author. Regardless of how secret Swift may have wanted his identity to be, most people in Ireland, including members of the Irish Privy Council, certainly knew that Swift was the author of the letters. Unfortunately for the Walpole administration, little legal proof was available of a relationship between the two that would justify them trying Swift as the \"Drapier\".\n\nOver the course of a year, four more pamphlets, filled with invective and complaints against both Wood and his patent, followed the first. The pamphlet was successful, and public opinion became so hostile against Wood's coinage that the patent was withdrawn by 1725. At one point, Lord Carteret and the Irish Privy Council offered a significant reward of £300 for information that would verify the identity of the pamphlet's author, but Swift was neither arrested nor charged for the works. The lack of an arrest and the unity of the Irish people behind the \"Drapier\" was an important motivating factor behind Walpole's withdrawal of the patent.\n\nAlthough Swift knew that the Duchess of Kendal was responsible for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the \"Letters\". Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. Although the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him in response to the third and fourth letters.\n\nIn the third and fourth letters, Swift argues that the Irish deserve independence from England, but not from the king. This, of all of the Drapier's arguments, is what agitated Walpole, as the head of the British Parliament, the most. Thus, the Drapier was condemned like William Molyneux, whose \"Case of Ireland\" (1698) pleaded for Irish independence using the same arguments. The claims of treason levelled against the Drapier were of \"treason to the English Parliament\", which only caused more resentment among the Irish people, who sided with Swift's constitutional argument that the Irish people owed their allegiance only to the king.\n\nThe first three pamphlets were written as a set intended to conclude the matter. However, when Lord Carteret was sent to control Ireland and placed a bounty on the Drapier's head, Swift felt that a fourth pamphlet was necessary. The fifth (in this list) was written at the height of the controversy over Wood's coin, and constitutes the final public writing of \"the Drapier\". The letter \"To the Lord Chancellor Middleton\" was signed with Swift's name and not collected until Faulkner's 1735 edition. The last letter, \"An Humble Address\", was also published after the conflict had ended.\n\nThe Drapier's first letter, \"To the Shop-keepers, Tradesmen, Farmers, and Common-People of Ireland\", was printed in March 1724. Shortly afterwards, a copy of the first letter was forwarded by Swift to Lord Carteret on 28 April 1724, and knowledge of the letter's contents had spread all the way to London. By April 1724, the letter was popular and Swift claimed that over 2,000 copies had been sold in Dublin. The letter was retitled \"Fraud Detected: or, The Hibernian Patriot\" by Faulkner's \"Dublin Journal\", which published the piece in 1725. \"Fraud Detected\" was later used by Faulkner as the title of the collection of the first five letters, published after the patent controversy ended.\n\nThe Drapier introduces his subject by invoking the duty of his readers as \"Christians, as parents, and as lovers of your country\". His purpose is to introduce the background of Wood's coin and then he suggests a boycott similar to the one in his \"Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture\". Throughout his monetary arguments, the Drapier constantly acknowledges how humble his station in life is, and incorporates theological and classical allusions to mock Wood. The Drapier places the blame for the coin upon Wood, stating: \"It is no treason to rebel against Mr Wood.\"\n\nThere are many religious overtones similar to Swift's sermons, such as the Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and the souls of the citizenry.\n\nOne of the concerns of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would no longer be able to pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.\n\nAlthough some critics and historians view the language and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth. Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his words and actions. Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king as leader of the Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's name and title as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon people at the top of the British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an \"insignificant hardware man\".\n\nThe Drapier's second letter, \"A Letter to Mr. Harding the Printer, upon Occasion of a Paragraph in his News-Paper of 1 August, relating to Mr. Wood's Half-Pence\", was printed on 4 August 1724, in response to the British Privy Council's testing of Wood's coin.\n\nThe Drapier alludes to the involvement of the Duchess of Kendall in his first letter; in the second, the Drapier de-emphasises her involvement and shifts his focus to blame the Whig party. According to the Drapier, the Whigs are the ones who Wood bribed in securing his patent. The central target for this letter is the Privy Council's report produced under the authority of Walpole. It was necessary for the Drapier to attack the report to ensure that the people would be willing to resist the coin and deny the \"truth\" that Wood's supporters issued. Therefore, the Drapier describes them as \"only a few Betrayers of their Country, Confederates with \"Woods\"\".\n\nThe Drapier does not directly attack Isaac Newton's assay of Wood's coin, but instead attacks the process behind the assay and the witnesses who testified before the Privy Council. In his criticism of the Privy Council's report, the Drapier claims that the report is part of Wood's propaganda and lies, because Wood released three proposals concurrent with the report: lowering the patent production quota from £100,800 to £40,000 worth; that no one is obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction; and to sell the coin at 2s 1d a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound. Wood's choice of wording, that the Irish would be \"obliged\" to accept the coin, was criticised by the Drapier who then accused Wood of \"perfect \"High Treason\"\" for obliging the people to take any copper coin when the king lacked the constitutional authority to do such a thing.\n\nIn the second letter, the Drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting the king and merely hinting at his relationship with Wood's patent; while the Drapier accuses Wood, he constantly refers to the king's authority and power to issue legal tender (this is called \"the King's Prerogative\"). In particular, the Drapier claims that the king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency. As the Drapier points out, the constitution establishing Ireland as a kingdom limits the authority of the monarch because it forces the people of Ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency. Throughout this argument, the Drapier compares the king's ability to print money with the petty amount of political power held by Wood, which undermines the image of the king as the supreme authority in Ireland while hinting that the king is not protecting the rights of the Irish people. The Drapier stops himself before he commits treason, and he instead argues that the king would never accept a patent that could harm Ireland; to the Drapier, the king would never act in such a way as to help Wood harm the people of Ireland.\n\nIn response to calls for action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing that they would not accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.\n\nThe Drapier's third letter, \"To the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom of Ireland: Some Observations Upon a Paper, Call'd, The Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Council in England relating to Wood's Half-pence\", was printed on 25 August 1724.\n\nThe subject matter of the third letter is similar to that of the second letter, and some scholars have explained this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility.\n\nThe Drapier spends most of his letter responding to the \"Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Councill in England\". This document released by Walpole served as a defence of Wood's coin; the report argued that the coin was important to the people of Ireland. However, the report was not officially released by Walpole in the Parliament's \"Gazette\", but published without Parliament's authority in the \"London Journal\" in August 1724. Some scholars have speculated that Walpole had the report published in a non-Parliamentary magazine so that he would not be connected directly to Wood's coin. However, the lack of Parliamentary authority behind the report allowed the Drapier to undermine the credibility of the report's content.\n\nThe Drapier claims, \"Mr. Wood in publishing this paper would insinuate to the world, as if the Committee had a greater concern for his credit and private emolument, than for the honour of the Privy-council and both Houses of Parliament here ... For it seems intended as a vindication of Mr. Wood, not without several severe remarks on the Houses of Lords and Commons of Ireland.\" To the Drapier, Wood has utter contempt for the political authority of Ireland, and would use his coin and the report to mock them. However, the attack extends beyond Wood to encompass a dispute about the authority of England to rule over the kingdom of Ireland.\n\nThe central argument in the letter is that the British have negated the rights of the Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, \"hath already tried his Faculty in \"New-England\", and I hope he will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what \"That\" was I leave to the Publick Intelligence.\" The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin.\n\nThe Drapier does not blame the production of the coining on Walpole's policies, in regard to England's colonies, but on Wood's (and his accomplice's) actions This criticism of Wood's actions allows the Drapier to attack the patent process in such a way that could not be used directly against the British Parliament. In referring to this point, the Drapier asks, \"Were not the People of \"Ireland\" born as Free as those of \"England\"?\"\n\nThe final image of this letter is that of the small but brave David versus the giant Goliath. Wood is the giant invader who wears his brass coin as armour and the Drapier is just the small merchant who is not big enough to fill the king's armour. This image resonated with the people, and a sign was displayed by people of Dublin which read:\n\nThe third letter openly incorporates Swift's argument that political authority stems from the consent of a population. As such, the third letter has been seen as a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.\n\nHowever, such an attack on the Declaratory Act was common in Swift's works, and he constantly argued against the act by promoting Irish autonomy. This does not mean that the Irish independence is to be taken lightly, because Swift viewed the self-reliance as \"the only means of halting their [the Irish/Irish Protestant] self-destructive complicity – of which they were inadequately aware – in England's ongoing consumption of Ireland.\"\n\nThe Drapier's fourth letter, \"To the Whole People of Ireland, A Word or Two to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland\", was written on 13 October 1724 and was either published on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.\n\nThe fourth letter was written in response to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.\n\nThe majority of the fourth letter is devoted to an argument revolving around the political liberty of the Irish people. It is for this argument that the Drapier was persecuted, because his words were seen as a call to challenge British authority and possibly to declare independence from the king. The Drapier walks a fine line between loyalty and disloyalty, because he charges that the Irish are loyal only to their king, who had the title \"King of Ireland\", but not to England. To this the Drapier states:\n\nIn defence of his nation, the Drapier turns around claims of treason and papal loyalty against Wood and his defenders (especially Walpole), calling them as treasonous as the Jacobite rebels and the Parliamentary rebels. The Drapier believed that God's providence supported the people of Ireland, but his will required the people of Ireland to stand up against the treasonous British.\n\nThe most famous and controversial statement of the \"Drapier's Letters\" follows claims of loyalty to the Irish king:\nThis line of argument follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the \"Two Treatises on Government\" (1689). Locke wrote that the people had the right to resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another.\n\nA secondary rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish in regard to Wood's patent; the rest of the constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.\n\nLord Carteret read passages from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for the identity of the Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an \"unfortunate accident\" and he did not want to respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, \"to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out\". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were \"ludicrous and satyrically writ\". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.\n\nRegardless of the proclamation against the Drapier and the words issued by important Irish officials, the people of Ireland had stood by the writer, and it was their support that protected Swift. Some critics have viewed this support as resulting from the letter's appeal to the \"mob\", or common people, of Ireland.\n\nThe Drapier's fifth letter, \"A Letter To the Honourable the Lord Viscount Molesworth, at his House at Brackdenstown, near Swords\" was published on 31 December 1724. The letter includes the most pseudo-biographical information on the Drapier.\n\nThis letter is seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a possible agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.\n\nThe Drapier begins his letter with three quotations: Psalm 109, Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 7, and Virgil's \"Aeneid\" Book Five. With these passages, he sets the tone for his own defence by appealing to both the reason and the religious sentiments of his audience to prove his innocence:\nSome critics argue that Swift did not need to defend himself, and \"To Viscount Molesworth\" was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter encourages the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.\n\nOther critics emphasise that the letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was targeted to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and the opposite of Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.\n\nThe letter serves one other purpose: to delight in the Drapier's lack of being captured and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, was the one who actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, \"Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury\", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is \"in some ways the best written of all the \"Letters\"\".\n\nThe sixth letter during the Drapier's campaign, \"To the Lord Chancellor Middleton\", is dated 26 October 1724, and was written as a private letter from Jonathan Swift to Alan Brodrick, Lord Midleton (with the misspelling of his title). It is not a true \"Drapier\" letter, because the author professes to be different from the Drapier, although he was known to be one and the same by Lord Midleton. Sir Walter Scott includes this letter as number five, although Faulkner, Sheridan, Deane Swift, Hawkesworth and Nichols label it as number six.\n\nThe purpose of the sixth letter was to ensure that Midleton would stay true to his opposition of Wood's patent. Although the extent to which Midleton was influenced by the letter cannot be known, it is certain that Midleton believed that the patent would harm Ireland and that he would resist it at all costs. Regardless, Swift wrote the letter to express himself in a way that the Drapier could not: as the dean of a great, Irish cathedral. He asserts his status to verify that the Drapier's intentions must be good. In essence, the letter rehashes many of the previous letters' arguments to draw Midleton into openly supporting the Drapier's actions. Swift also admits to actively working against the patent, and mentions how his \"On Doing Good\" sermon is similar to the ideas expressed by the Drapier.\n\nThe Drapier's last letter, \"An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament\", was completed in June 1725. It was written before Wood's patent was defeated, and it was stopped from being printed when word reached Swift that the patent had been withdrawn. This letter remained unpublished for 10 years.\n\nThe letter challenges the Ireland's parliament to investigate how Wood originally attained the patent, even though most in power knew that the patent was the result of bribery. Although nothing new would be discovered in an investigation, the letter served the purpose of trying to unite the people of Ireland to fight for further economic freedom. The Drapier refers to Ireland's lack of economic freedom when he claims, the Irish \"are altogether Losers, and \"England\" a Gainer\". Swift's intentions behind the letter are uncertain, and some critics believe that Swift did not desire such an investigation into Wood's supporters while others contend that Swift was serious about promoting a public inquiry into the matter.\n\nThe topics the Drapier addresses span from absentee land owners to importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues were not as important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing \"Gulliver's Travels\", in which he picked up many of the same ideas.\n\nJohn Harding published the first four letters before he was arrested and the fifth after his release. After Harding's death, George Faulkner became Swift's primary publisher in Ireland, and \"A Letter to the Lord Chancellor Middleton\" and \"An Humble Address\" were copied from manuscript copies provided by the author to Faulkner and then printed with the other letters. The \"Drapier's Letters\" were first collected and published in their entirety by Faulkner in 1735.\n\nOn 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised his future publication of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the \"Drapier's Letters\", in the \"Dublin Journal\". However, this edition led to the Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under British copyright legislation, to many of the works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the \"Drapier's Letters\" were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.\n\nAlthough the original printing of the \"Drapier's Letters\" resulted in the arrest of Harding and a bounty placed upon the Drapier's head, Swift's actions in defending Ireland were deemed heroic among the Irish citizenry. He was titled the \"Hibernian patriot\" for his actions. Some residents of Dublin placed banners and signs in the city to recognise Swift's deeds, and images from the letters, such as the Drapier comparing his campaign to David fighting Goliath, became themes in popular literature. Scholar Herbert Davis claims that by the end of 1725, Swift was \"the Darling of the populace; His Image and Superscription on a great many Sign-Posts\" in Ireland.\n\nSwift did not fully embrace his popularity, but he enjoyed it. On his birthday, 30 November 1727, a large group of men came to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray and afterwards celebrate throughout the city. This gathering commemorated Swift and his letters and also protested against the harsh British treatment of Ireland.\n\nAccording to Robert Mahony, the \"Drapier's Letters\", especially the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists. However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that Swift is speaking more for the Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol Fabricant, have asked who \"the Whole People of Ireland\" are, \"who\" the \"Drapier's Letters\" are speaking \"to\", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, to speak for the entire nation. R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented \"Ascendancy attitudes,\" but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule. In overall effect, Fabricant argued that Swift's ability to speak for the whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the \"Drapier's Letters\", to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 2000. In the episode, Barney realizes how much of a pathetic drunk he is after watching his birthday party video and decides to give up alcohol forever, which upsets his friend Homer. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa work together to take a memorable photo for a new phone book cover contest. \n\nThe episode was written by cast member Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta. They originally pitched the story during the production of the series' fourth season, but the concept was rejected on the basis of being too similar to the episode \"Duffless\"; it was later revived by showrunner Mike Scully.\n\nSeveral staff members opposed the idea of Barney becoming sober because they did not think his character change would be funny. Several critics, including Chris Turner, were also not fond of Barney's change.\n\nAfter watching his embarrassing birthday party video and being mocked by his friends with gag gifts, Barney realizes he is a hideous drunk, and promises to get sober. At first, he finds sustaining sobriety tough, but he finds his way to an AA meeting with Homer's help, and soon goes to The Springfield Flight School where he takes helicopter-flying lessons. At Moe's Tavern, Homer is treated as the new Barney and is forced by Moe, Lenny, and Carl to perform drunken antics. Barney gives Homer a ride in the helicopter a few lessons later with the two fighting about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that they no longer have ridiculous adventures.\n\nMeanwhile, to get their picture on the cover of the new phone book and win the prize of a new bicycle, Bart and Lisa enter an amateur photo contest. They find an old camera with an old roll of film and start to take snapshots with it. One day, they are taking pictures atop Mt. Springfield when Bart inadvertently starts a forest fire by carelessly discarding a hot flashbulb, putting them in imminent danger.\n\nAt Moe's, Barney arrives to make amends for his drunken behavior; when he and Homer see the news report of the fire, they band together to save Bart and Lisa. They hop in the helicopter, but land in the middle of a bridge when Barney panics over flying the helicopter, having not yet finished the lessons. When a Duff beer truck on the bridge spills its contents in front of Barney, Homer refuses to let him give up on sobriety and drinks an entire six-pack in his place, leaving Barney touched at his gesture. Together, Barney and a drunken Homer save the kids, and Bart commemorates the moment by taking a photo of the fire on Mt. Springfield, submitting it as his and Lisa's entry to the photo contest.\n\nThe next day, at the Simpson house, Marge tells the children that the new phone books are here, and they have Bart and Lisa's picture on the front cover. Bart and Lisa realize that the picture on one of the phone books is not the one of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was in the film on the camera and that since she had taken it, she won the bike for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother, because they got the bike. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his friendship with Homer are restored, and he looks forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes. It transpires that the coffees Barney drink are really supplied by Moe's coffee cart, who delights in the fact that Barney, having swapped his addiction from alcohol to coffee, is still a customer to him.\n\n\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\", the eighteenth episode of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000), was written by Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta, and directed by Neil Affleck. In the early 1990s, Castellaneta, the voice of Homer, Barney, and many other characters on the show, conceived the idea to write an episode in which Barney sobers up. He told Lacusta of the idea, who wrote a draft that they then revised together. They presented their script to Al Jean when he and Mike Reiss were show runners on \"The Simpsons\". Though Jean liked the story, he turned it down because the staff was already working on a similar episode where Homer gives up beer—\"Duffless\" (1993). Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and presented their script, which they had updated, to then-showrunner Mike Scully (1997–2001), who liked it but had them make some changes.\n\nSeveral members of the staff, including \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, have stated that they were against the episode as they felt Barney being sober was not funny. After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer/producer David Mirkin, who had friends that had stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee. For the episode, the animators gave Barney back-slicked hair to indicate his sobriety, a look which Barney maintained in subsequent episodes until he relapsed in \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\" (2003). Castellaneta altered his voice for the sober Barney by no longer slurring.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 2000. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.3 and was the second highest-rated show on Fox network that week, following Malcolm in the Middle. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Dan Castellaneta, Deb Lacusta and Neil Affleck participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \"manages some good bits but not enough to make it a quality program.\" He also wrote that \"If you thought that 'Alone Again, Natura-Diddly' would be Season 11's sole episode that features a big change for a secondary character, you thought wrong. No, Barney's sobriety isn't as major an event as Maude's demise, but it actually has a bigger impact on the series. After all, Maude was a tertiary role; her disappearance affects secondary personality Ned, but she didn't appear all that much, so she didn't really go missed. Making Barney sober affects the series on a much more consistent basis – though probably not in a good way. After all, most of Barney's appeal came from his drunken idiocy, so he loses his natural kick when he goes on the wagon.\"\n\nSeveral other writers have commented on Barney becoming sober. IGN staff members stated in 2006 that Barney has \"been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he's sobered up...But let's face it, for comedy's sake, \"The Simpsons\" is better off with a drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe's.\" \n\nAuthor Chris Turner wrote in his book \"Planet Simpson\" that \"Barney is a good example of what happens when [the staff members] tinker too much. Barney was great as just the town drunk. Making him sober falls into the trap of all the stuff \"The Simpsons\" satirizes, all those simple sitcom narratives where everything is wrapped up in half an hour and everyone learns a lesson in the end.\" \n\nIn 2001, \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\" received a commendation from the Prism Awards, which honors accurate portrayals of substance abuse, addiction and mental health in entertainment programming.\n\n"}

After several years teaching at Cambridge University in England, he returned to China, where he resided from the 1960s to his death, working as a translator and economic advisor.\n\nFrom the early 1960s, Adler was also affiliated with the International Liaison Department, an important organ of the Chinese Communist Party organ whose functions include foreign intelligence.\n\nSolomon Adler was born on 6 August 1909 in Leeds, England. The Adler family was of Jewish ancestry and originally from Karelitz, Belarus, moving to Leeds in 1900. Solomon Adler was the fifth of ten children; the oldest was Saul Adler, who became a well-known Israeli parasitologist. Adler studied economics at Oxford and University College, London. He came to the United States in 1935 to do research.\n\nIn 1936, he was hired at the Works Progress Administration's National Research Project but soon moved to the Treasury Department's Division of Monetary Research and Statistics, where he worked with Harry Dexter White for the next several years.\n\nAdler became a naturalized US citizen in 1940. In 1941, he was posted to China, where he remained as Treasury representative until 1948. His reports from China to Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., during the war years were widely circulated and played an important role in shaping American wartime economic policy toward China.\n\nIn 1949, Adler became the subject of a Loyalty of Government Employees investigation. He resigned before the case was resolved and returned to Britain, where he taught for several years at Cambridge University. When his US passport expired, he was denaturalized and lost his citizenship. Adler moved to China in the early 1960s, working in the lead group of the team translating Mao Zedong's works into English.\n\nWhen the United States re-established diplomatic contacts with China in 1971, Adler renewed his US citizenship. He died in Beijing on August 4, 1994, two days before it would have been his 85th birthday.\n\nIn 1939, Whittaker Chambers identified Adler to then-Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a member of an underground Communist group in Washington, DC, the Ware group. Chambers correctly identified Adler as serving in the General Counsel's Office at the Treasury Department, from which, Chambers said, Adler supplied weekly reports to the Communist Party of the United States. In 1945, Elizabeth Bentley identified Adler as a member of the Silvermaster group. A 1948 memo written by Anatoly Gorsky, a former NKVD \"rezident\" in Washington DC, identified Adler as a Soviet agent designated \"Sax.\" That agent, transliterated \"Sachs (Saks)\" appears in the Venona decrypts supplying information about the Chinese Communists by both Gorsky and the head of the US Communist Party, Earl Browder.\n\nIn addition to his contacts with US espionage groups, while he was serving as Treasury attache in China in 1944, Adler shared a house with Chinese Communist secret agent Chi Ch'ao-ting and State Department officer John Stewart Service, who was arrested the next year in the \"Amerasia\" case.\n\nTogether with Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and V. Frank Coe, Director of the Treasury's Division of Monetary Research, Adler strongly opposed a gold loan program of $200 million to help the Chinese Nationalists control the inflation that took hold in unoccupied China during World War II. Between 1943 and 1945, prices rose more than 1,000% per year, weakening the Nationalist government. The inflation helped the Communists eventually come to power in China, and in later years White, Coe, and Adler were accused of having deliberately fostered inflation by obstructing the stabilization loan.\n\nA Chinese work published in 1983 stated that from 1963 on Adler worked for China's International Liaison Department, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party whose functions include foreign intelligence. According to historian R. Bruce Craig, Adler's apartment in Beijing was provided by the Liaison Department, indicating that the department was Adler's work unit.\n\n\n\n"}

He continued his career as a solo artist and became a music producer who worked with many internationally famous artists.\n\nMándoki studied drums and percussion at the musical conservatory of Budapest in the early 1970s. At the same time he was a band leader for the local jazz-rock group JAM, citing groups like Cream and Jethro Tull as his influence.\n\nIn July 1975, Mándoki, along with Gábor Csupó (the creator of Rugrats) and others, fled from Hungary to Munich, West Germany to avoid prosecution by the communist regime for being a member of the student opposition. He had been imprisoned 17 times for his political opposition before he fled into the West.\n\nDschinghis Khan, where Mandoki was one of the six members, was the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1979, finishing on 4th place. Mandoki performed on 15 episodes of the music show \"ZDF Hitparade\" with Dschinghis Khan between 1979 and 1982. Mandoki stated in later interviews that he was glad about his time with Dschingis Khan, although he felt unsure at the time about being in the group as he felt more at home with rock music. He has not taken part in the reunion of Dschingis Khan since 2015.\n\nMandoki is today a well-known producer who has rented the Park Studios near Lake Starnberg. He has worked as a producer for many German and international acts, including the No Angels, Phil Collins, Engelbert, Joshua Kadison, Lionel Richie and Jennifer Rush. He also worked as a musical director for commercials, with clients including Audi, Daimler and Disney.\n\nIn 1993, Mandoki founded a group called \"ManDoki Soulmates\", which combines elements of Progressive rock with jazz music. The group has produced more than a dozen albums since then. Many famous artists appeared as guest musicians on the Soulmates albums, including Ian Anderson, Robin Gibb, Jack Bruce, Steve Lukather, Bobby Kimball, Midge Ure, Nik Kershaw, Al Di Meola, Michael and Randy Brecker, Till Brönner and Eric Burdon.\n\nIn April and November 2004 Mandoki and the Soulmates appeared together with many acclaimed international artists in the two-part television show \"50 Jahre Rock\" (50 years of rock) on ZDF hosted by Thomas Gottschalk. Material from these shows was later used for the album \"Legends of Rock\".\n\nIn 2003 he played a guest role on three episodes of the German teenager television series \"Schloss Einstein\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1901801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901801", "title": "The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory", "text": "The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\n\nLa Desintegración de la Persistencia de la Memoria or The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí. It is a 1954 re-creation of the artist's famous 1931 work \"The Persistence of Memory\", and measures a diminutive 25.4 × 33 cm. It was originally known as The Chromosome of a Highly-coloured Fish's Eye Starting the Harmonious Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, and first exhibited at the Carstairs Gallery in New York in 1954.\n\nIn this version, the landscape from the original work has been flooded with water. Disintegration depicts what is occurring both above and below the water's surface. The landscape of Cadaqués is now hovering above the water. The plane and block from the original is now divided into brick-like shapes that float in relation to each other, with nothing binding them. These represent the breakdown of matter into atoms, a revelation in the age of quantum mechanics. Behind the bricks, the horns receding into the distance symbolise atomic missiles, highlighting that despite cosmic order, humanity could bring about its own destruction. The dead olive tree from which the soft watch hangs has also begun to break apart. The hands of the watches float above their dials, with several conical objects floating in parallel formations encircling the watches. A fourth melting watch has been added. The distorted human visage from the original painting is beginning to morph into another of the strange fish floating above it. To Dalí, however, the fish was a symbol of life.\n\nDalí had been greatly interested in nuclear physics since the first atomic bomb explosions of August 1945, and described the atom as his \"favourite food for thought\". Recognising that matter was made up of atoms which did not touch each other, he sought to replicate this in his art at the time, with items suspended and not interacting with each other, such as in \"The Madonna of Port Lligat\". To Dalí, this image was symbolic of the new physics—the quantum world which exists as both particles and waves. The imagery of the original \"Persistence of Memory\" can be read as a representation of Einstein's theory of relativity (although Dalí himself denied the connection to the theory), symbolizing the relativity of time and space. In this new work, quantum mechanics is symbolized by \"digitizing\" the old image.\n\nDalí symbolised and marked the loss of his interest in surrealism with \"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\" as his interest in nuclear physics and religion led him elsewhere.\n\nThe painting is currently owned by the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was transported to and exhibited at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne in 2009, along with many other Dalí paintings in the \"Liquid Desire\" exhibition.\n"}

He had two children with Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld, a son named Théophile and a daughter named Céleste.\n\nBauby was born in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. He began his journalism career at \"Combat\" and then \"Le Quotidien de Paris\". He received his first byline the day Georges Pompidou died in 1974. At age 28, he was promoted to editor-in-chief of the daily \"Le Matin de Paris\", before becoming editor of the cultural section of \"Paris Match\". He then joined the editorial staff of \"Elle\".\n\nOn 8 December 1995, at the age of 43, Bauby suffered a major stroke. When he woke up in hospital twenty days later, he found he was entirely speechless; he could only blink his left eyelid. Called locked-in syndrome, this is a condition wherein the mental faculties remain intact but most of the body is paralyzed. In Bauby's case, his mouth, arms, and legs were paralyzed, and he lost in the first 20 weeks after his stroke.\n\nDespite his condition, he wrote the book \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" by blinking when the correct letter was reached by a person slowly reciting the alphabet over and over again using a system called partner-assisted scanning. Bauby composed and edited the book entirely in his head, and dictated it one letter at a time. To make dictation more efficient, Bauby's interlocutor, Claude Mendibil, listed the letters in accordance with their frequency in the French language. The book was published in France on 7 March 1997. Bauby died suddenly from pneumonia age 44 two days after the publication of his book, and he is buried in a family grave at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, France.\n\nJean-Jacques Beineix directed a short documentary film entitled \"Assigné à résidence\" about Bauby's time at Berck-sur-Mer, which was released in 1997. The film features Bauby himself, as well as appearances by his interlocutor, Claude Mandibil, and his partner, Florence Ben Sadoun.\nIn 2007, painter-director Julian Schnabel released a film version of \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood. It starred actor Mathieu Amalric as Bauby. Critically acclaimed, the film received many awards and nominations including the Best Director Prize at Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film & Best Director, as well as 4 Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe script written for the film has been criticized by Bauby's closest circle of friends as not faithful to events and biased in favor of his ex-partner. His late-life partner Florence Ben Sadoun claims to have been a faithful companion, visiting him frequently at Berck-sur-Mer, the hospital where he lived during his final days. Bauby notes her visits in his memoir. Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld also claims to have visited him frequently at the hospital.\n\n"}

Nowadays, it provides access to many interesting sights, like the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Dean Gallery. \n\nThe path starts next to Balerno High School and runs 12.25 miles (19.6 kilometres) to Leith. The path runs downhill, but the incline is so slight that it is barely perceptible. Approximately half a mile of the route is on roads, for the remainder the path runs alongside the Water of Leith, and away from traffic. The section from Balerno to Slateford utilises the dismantled Balerno railway line The path surface is a mixture of tarmac, compressed grit and compressed earth. The surface is uniformly good with very few muddy patches or potholes. The route is well used by both pedestrians and cyclists. \n\nThe path is fairly well signposted, but there are one or two places in Edinburgh where the path meets a road and it is necessary to hunt around for its continuation. Some signposts have been vandalised or pointed in the wrong direction. \n\nThe path passes through the attractive Dean Village area of Edinburgh and ends in the docks at Leith. \n\nWalkers can return to Balerno by catching a bus to the centre of Edinburgh from Ocean Terminal, and then the 44 bus to Balerno. For cyclists the easiest way to return to Balerno is to cycle back.\n\nThe Water of Leith is also a good fishing spot due to the concerted effort to clean up the water. You can expect to catch wild brown trout (\"Salmo trutta m. fario\") and grayling (\"Thymallus thymallus\") with the odd pike (\"Esox lucius\") lurking nearby. Grayling only swim in clean water so this is a good advertisement for the Water of Leith itself.\n\n"}

It is long and extends from India to the Tibetan Autonomous Region, China. Approximately 60% of the length of the lake lies within the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The lake is wide at its broadest point. All together it covers 604 km. During winter the lake freezes completely, despite being saline water. It is not a part of the Indus river basin area and geographically a separate landlocked river basin.\n\nThe lake is in the process of being identified under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. This will be the first trans-boundary wetland in South Asia under the convention.\n\nHistorically, the lake was treated as a string of five smaller lakes with channels connecting them, the name \"Pangong Tso\" only applied to the western most lake that is mostly in Ladakh. From west to east, these lakes were each referred to as -- Pangong Tso, Tso Nyak, the twin lakes of Rum Tso, and Nyak Tso. The whole lake group was and is still often referred to as Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo () in Tibetan. \n\nThere are different interpretations on the meanings of both \"Pangong Tso\" and \"Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo\". The Ladakh government website indicates \"Pangong Tso\" is Tibetan meaning \"high grassland lake\", however travel books from decades back say Pangong means \"hollow\". \"Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo\" is Tibetan that is interpreted to mean various different but similar meanings -- \"long, narrow, enchanted lake\" by Chinese media sources, \"female narrow very long lake\" by early European explorers, and \"long-necked swan lake\" by other modern sources. The lake has also been referred to as Pan-kung Hu.\n\nThe eastern part of the lake is fresh, with the content of total dissolved solids at 0.68 g/L, while the western part of the lake is saline, with the salinity at 11.02 g/L. The brackish water of the lake has very low micro-vegetation. Guides report that there are no fish or other aquatic life on the Indian side of the lake, except for some small crustaceans. On the other hand, visitors see numerous ducks and gulls over and on the lake surface. There are some species of scrub and perennial herbs that grow in the marshes around the lake.\n\nThe lake acts as an important breeding ground for a variety of birds including a number of migratory birds. During summer, the Bar-headed goose and Brahmini ducks are commonly seen here. The region around the lake supports a number of species of wildlife including the kiang and the marmot. The lake hosts large quantities of fish, especially \"Schizopygopsis stoliczkai\" and \"Racoma labiata\".\n\nFormerly, Pangong Tso had an outlet to Shyok River, a tributary of Indus River, but it was closed off due to natural damming. Two streams feed the lake from the Indian side, forming marshes and wetlands at the edges. Strand lines above current lake level reveal a thick layer of mud and laminated sand, suggesting the lake has shrunken recently in geological scale.\nOn the Indian side, no fish have been observed, however in the stream coming from South-eastern side (Cheshul nalla), three fish species (\"Schizopygopsis stoliczkae\", \"Tibetan stone loach\" and \"Triplophysa gracilis\") have been reported (Bhat et al., 2011). The low biodiversity has been reported as being due to high salinity and harsh environmental conditions (Bhat et al., 2011).\n\nBird Islet is the most famous island in Pangong Tso.\n\nAn Inner Line Permit is required to visit the lake as it lies on the Sino-Indian Line of Actual Control. While Indian nationals can obtain individual permits, others must have group permits (with a minimum of three persons) accompanied by an accredited guide; the tourist office in Leh issues the permits for a small fee. For security reasons, India does not permit boating.\n\nChina National Highway 219 passes by the eastern end of Pangong Tso. The lake can be accessed by driving 12 km from Rutog or 130 km from Shiquanhe. Tourists can rent a boat on the lake, but landing on islands is not allowed for protecting the breeding ground of the birds. There are several restaurants along the shore.\n\nPangong Tso is in disputed territory. The Line of Actual Control passes through the lake. A section of the lake approximately 20 km east from the Line of Actual Control is controlled by China but claimed by India. The eastern end of the lake is in Tibet. After the mid-19th century, Pangong Tso was at the southern end of Johnson Line, an early attempt at demarcation between India and China in the Aksai Chin region.\n\nThe Khurnak Fort lies on the northern bank of the lake, halfway of Pangong Tso. The Chinese has controlled the Khurnak Fort area since 1952. To the south is the smaller Spanggur Tso lake.\n\nOn 20 October 1962, Pangong Tso saw military action during the Sino-Indian War, successful for the Communist People's Liberation Army.\n\nPangong Tso is still a delicate border point along the Line of Actual Control. Incursions from the Chinese side are common.\n\nIn August 2017, Indian and Chinese forces near Pangong Tso threw rocks at each other.\n\nOn September 11, 2019, People's Liberation Army troops confronted Indian troops on the northern bank of Pangong Lake.\n\nOn May 5-6, 2020, there was a face-off between about 250 Indian and Chinese troops near Pangong Tso lake. 11 Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured.\n\nAs tourism grows in Ladakh and Pangong Lake, the ecologically fragile area is getting swamped with trash. Authorities are trying to put a mechanism in place to manage the waste generated by restaurants, hotels, and camping sites. Tourists often dump disposable water bottles and food packets right at the periphery of the lake and even inside. This is posing a big threat to this glacial lake.\n\n\n\n"}

The traditional foods consist of a mix of Native American cuisine from indigenous groups such as the Lenca and Pipil peoples with influences from Spanish cuisine. Many of the dishes are made with maize (corn). There is also heavy use of pork and seafood.\n\nEl Salvador's most notable dish is the \"pupusa\", a thick handmade corn flour or rice flour flatbread stuffed with cheese, \"chicharrón\" (cooked pork meat ground to a paste consistency), refried beans or \"loroco\" (a vine flower bud native to Central America). There are also vegetarian options, often with ayote (a type of squash) or garlic. Some restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach which are served with \"salsa roja\", a cooked tomato sauce, often served with \"curtido\". \"Pollo encebollado\" is another popular Salvadoran dish that contains chicken simmered with onions. Salvadoran cheeses, \"queso duro\" (hard cheese), \"queso fresco\" (fresh cheese), and \"cuajada\", are eaten with meals.\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are \"yuca frita\" and \"panes rellenos\". \"Yuca frita\" is deep-fried cassava root served with \"curtido\" (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and chicharron with \"pepesca\" (fried baby sardines). The yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. \"Panes rellenos\" (\"stuffed bread\") are warm submarine sandwiches. The turkey or chicken is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with turkey or chicken, tomato, and watercress along with cucumber, cabbage, and traditional stuffed panes do not include mayonnaise.\n\nOther well-known Salvadoran dishes include \"carne guisada\" (saucy beef with potatoes and carrots), \"lomo entomatado\" (beef with tomatoes), \"carne asada\" (grilled steak, usually served with a type of Salvadoran salsa called \"chimol\"), \"pasteles de carne\" (meat pies), \"pollo guisado con hongos\" (chicken with mushrooms), \"pacaya planta\" (palm flowers breaded in cornmeal, fried and served with tomato sauce), \"pavo salvadoreño\" (roast turkey with sauce, often eaten for Christmas), \"ceviche de camarones\" (lime-cooked shrimp), and \"pescado empanizado\" (breaded, fried fish fillets). Salvadorean chorizo is short, fresh (not dried) and tied into twin sausages.\n\nEl Salvador is known for different types of tamales, which are usually wrapped in plantain leaves. These tamales include:\n\nSoups and salads are popular among Salvadorans of every social level.\n\n\"Sopa de pata\" is a soup made from the tripe of a cow, plantain, corn, tomatoes, cabbage and spices, locally a delicacy.\n\n\"Sopa de res\" is a soup made from beef shank, beef bone with meat, carrots, plantain, corn, potatoes, zucchini, and many other ingredients.\n\n\"Gallo en chicha\" is a soup made with rooster, corn, \"dulce de tapa\", and sometimes other things.\n\n\"Sopa de pescado\" is a soup made out of fish or seafood with corn flour, tomatoes, green peppers, cumin, achiote and other ingredients, commonly eaten for the Christian holiday of Good Friday.\n\n\"Sopa de pollo\" is a chicken stew with tomatoes, green peppers, guisquil, carrots, potatoes, \"consommé\", and other ingredients.\n\n\"Sopa de gallina india\" is a chicken broth with vegetables. Some people add lorocos and cream.\n\n\"Sopa de frijoles\" (bean soup) is a red bean soup.\n\n\"Salpicón or Picadillo\" Salpicón is a dish made with minced beef, mint and onions. Some people add rice.\n\n\"Panes rellenos\" (stuffed bread) are warm sandwiches, often made with chicken, carne asada, or turkey. The chicken or turkey is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and watercress.\n\nSalvadoran desserts include \"pan dulce\", \"semita\", Salvadoran \"quesadilla\" (a type of cheese-based pastry, similar to the Honduran \"rosquillo\" and unrelated to the Mexican quesadilla), \"torta de yema\", \"marquezote\", \"salpores\", \"poleada\" (vanilla custard), \"arroz con leche\" (rice pudding), \"atol de elote\", \"atol de piña\", \"empanadas de platano\" (plantain patties), and many others. The \"dulce de leche\" of El Salvador has a soft, crumbly texture, with an almost crystallized form. Fruits are widely consumed, the most popular being mangoes, coconuts, papayas, and bananas. Sometimes fruit with ice cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top is served.\n\nTeenagers usually drink \"cokas\" (soft drinks) like Coca-Cola, while young and old alike drink coffee, El Salvador's top export. \"Viejitas\", \"little old ladies\", are biscuits dipped in morning coffee.\n\nA very popular soda that originated in El Salvador is \"Kolachampan\", which is a soda with sugar cane flavor. \"Minutas\", shaved ice flavored with fruit flavored syrup, and \"horchata\", a beverage made from rice milk and a mix of spices such as cinnamon, peanut beverage, \"ajonjolí\" (sesame seeds) and morro, are popular throughout the country and enjoyed on a hot day.\n\n\"Licuados\" are like the minutas with added fresh fruit and (sometimes) milk. \"Refrescos\" refer to lemonades or other sweetened fruit drinks. Other drinks include \"Arrayán\", \"Chuco\" and \"Chilate\". Another popular beverage is \"ensalada\" (\"salad\"), made of pineapple juice with finely chopped fruits, usually apples, marañón, mamey, and watercress.\n\nTamarindo juice is consumed in all of El Salvador. Coconuts are sold at roadside estansas throughout the country. Typically, they are chopped with machetes and a straw is inserted so that the coconut water can be consumed. Adults drink coconut milk, mixed with vodka, as an aperitif. \"Vinagre de piña\" is a drink of trimmed pineapples mixed with Panela and water and set aside to ferment for a few weeks or even months.\n\nThe most common alcoholic beverage in El Salvador is beer (\"cerveza\"). The most popular brand name is Pilsener (brand). Suprema is considered the premier local brew. Both of these and other popular beers are made by Industrias La Constancia. More recently, Cerveza Cadejo has become increasingly popular in El Salvador. Cadejo is a microbrewery based in San Salvador that was inspired by US microbreweries.\n\nThe national liquor of El Salvador is Tic Tack, a sugar cane distillate. Tick Tack has similar flavors to cachaça.\n\nSalvadorans eat a large variety of seafood. Salvadoran ceviches are made with clams, oysters, fish, shrimp, snails, octopus, squid, and a type of black clam called \"conchas\" by locals. Cocktails and ceviches are prepared with a type of tomato and chopped onion sauce or a dark sauce called \"Salsa Perring\", which is a local way of pronouncing Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, and both are sprinkled with lemon juice.\n\nSalvadorans also eat fried crabs and lobsters or fried fish with garlic and lemon. Shrimps are also eaten roasted, \"al ajillo\" (aal-aheejo: means in garlic), or in butter. There is also a type of seafood soup called \"mariscada\" (\"maareescaadaa\"), which contains fish, clams, octopus, squid, shrimp, and crab.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901849", "title": "Informant", "text": "Informant\n\nAn informant (also called an informer) is a person who provides privileged information about a person or organization to an agency. The term is usually used within the law enforcement world, where they are officially known as confidential human source (CHS), cooperating witness (CW), or criminal informants (CI). It can also refer pejoratively to someone who supplies information without the consent of the involved parties. The term is commonly used in politics, industry, entertainment, and academia.\n\nInformants are also extremely common in every-day police work, including homicide and narcotics investigations. Any citizen who provides crime related information to law enforcement by definition is an informant.\n\nThe CIA has been criticized for leniency towards drug lords and murderers acting as paid informants, informants being allowed to engage in some crimes so that the potential informant can blend into the criminal environment without suspicion, and wasting billions of dollars on dishonest sources of information.\n\nInformants are often regarded as traitors by their former criminal associates. Whatever the nature of a group, it is likely to feel strong hostility toward any known informers, regard them as threats and inflict punishments ranging from social ostracism through physical abuse and/or death. Informers are therefore generally protected, either by being segregated while in prison or, if they are not incarcerated, relocated under a new identity.\n\nInformants, and especially criminal informants, can be motivated by many reasons. Many informants are not themselves aware of all of their reasons for providing information, but nonetheless do so. Many informants provide information while under stress, duress, emotion and other life factors that can impact the accuracy or veracity of information provided.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and others should be aware of possible motivations so that they can properly approach, assess and verify informants' information.\n\nGenerally, informants' motivations can be broken down into self-interest, self-preservation and conscience.\n\nA list of possible motivations includes:\n\nSelf-Interest:\n\nSelf-Preservation:\n\nConscience:\n\nCorporations and the detective agencies that sometimes represent them have historically hired labor spies to monitor or control labor organizations and their activities. Such individuals may be professionals or recruits from the workforce. They may be willing accomplices, or may be tricked into informing on their co-workers' unionization efforts.\n\nPaid informants have often been used by authorities within politically and socially oriented movements to weaken, destabilize and ultimately break them.\n\nInformers alert authorities regarding government officials that are corrupt. Officials may be taking bribes, or participants in a money loop also called a kickback. Informers in some countries receive a percentage of all monies recovered by their government.\n\nLactantius described an example from ancient Rome involved the prosecution of a woman suspected to have advised a woman not to marry Maximinus II: \"Neither indeed was there any accuser, until a certain Jew, one charged with other offences, was induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the innocent. The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him... The Jew was ordered to the torture till he should speak as he had been instructed... The innocent were condemned to die... Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all the beholders that the women died innocent.\"\n\nCriminal informant schemes have been used as cover for politically motivated intelligence offensives.\n\nJailhouse informants, who report hearsay (admissions against penal interest) which they claim to have heard while the accused is in pretrial detention, usually in exchange for sentence reductions or other inducements, have been the focus of particular controversy. Some examples of their use are in connection with Stanley Williams, Cameron Todd Willingham, Gerald Stano, Thomas Silverstein, Marshall \"Eddie\" Conway, and a suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz. The Innocence Project has stated that 15% of all wrongful convictions later exonerated because of DNA results were accompanied by false testimony by jailhouse informants. 50% of murder convictions exonerated by DNA were accompanied by false testimony by jailhouse informants.\n\nSlang terms for informants include:\n\nThe phrase \"drop a dime\" refers to an informant using a payphone to call the authorities to report information.\n\nThe term \"stool pigeon\" originates from the antiquated practice of tying a passenger pigeon to a stool. The bird would flap its wings in a futile attempt to escape. The sound of the wings flapping would attract other pigeons to the stool where a large number of birds could be easily killed or captured.\n\n\nA system of informants existed in Russian Empire and later adopted by the Soviet Union. In Russia such person was known as osvedomitel or donoschik and secretly cooperated with law enforcement agencies such as Okhranka or later Soviet militsiya or KGB. Officially those informants were referred to as secret coworker (, sekretny sotrudnik) and often were referred by a Russian derived portmanteau seksot.\n\nIn some KGB documents has also been used a term \"source of operational information\" (, istochnik operativnoi informatsii).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901850", "title": "Last Tap Dance in Springfield", "text": "Last Tap Dance in Springfield\n\n\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\" is the twentieth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 7, 2000. In the episode, Lisa decides to sign up for tap dancing lessons after being inspired by a film about a girl who enters a tango contest and wins. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse hide out at the mall to escape going to summer camp. \"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\" was written by Julie Thacker, who based it on her own experiences with dance classes. \n\nThe episode has received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nOn a trip to the mall, Homer sees an optometrist to get his eyes examined and gets laser surgery after rejecting a number of eyeglasses. After the surgery, Homer rejects the optometrist's advice to take eye drops to keep his eyes from crusting over—and ends up blind from his eyes scabbing over and kidnapped tricked into driving to the liquor store to buy Jack Daniel's and \"a carton of smokes\" for Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney (the latter of whom fools Homer into thinking he's Marge). However, he does get his vision back for the unknown.\n\nAt the same time, Marge and Lisa find items for Bart's school camping trip. Marge sees a poster for the film \"Tango de La Muerte\" at the mall's cineplex and she and Lisa decide to see it. Lisa identifies with the main female character, a bookworm named \"Lisabella\" whom the tango champion asks to be his partner and with whom he then falls in love. This inspires Lisa to enroll at a dance school, where she wants to take tango classes. She is pushed into tap lessons by an obnoxious former child star named Vicki Valentine. Lisa's hopes of being a dancer are crushed when she finds that she is the worst dancer there, even being out-performed by Ralph Wiggum. She continues to attend the tap classes because she does not want to upset Homer and Marge. When the school organizes a dance recital, Lisa finds that she will not be dancing and has been relegated to pulling the curtain to open the show (Vicki eventually decides that the curtain-pulling is too important for Lisa and instead does it herself). Professor Frink, overhearing, devises a plan to attach a device to Lisa's shoes that will make them automatically tap at any percussive sound. This allows her to mimic the other dancers and take part in the recital. She becomes a star at the show, even upstaging an enraged Vicki Valentine, but when the audience applauds her, her shoes go out of control. Homer stops the shoes from going haywire by tripping Lisa. Vicki finally seems to empathize with Lisa's desperation to be a star (though she notes, to the bemusement of Homer and Marge, that this involved Vicki's destroying the credit rating of Buddy Ebsen). Lisa walks off with her parents, having decided that tap dancing is not for her.\n\nMeanwhile, Bart and Milhouse sneak out of their camping trip after discovering that Nelson Muntz will be there with them with plans to beat them both up on the reg. They decide to hide in the mall and spend the night there, having shoe fights and causing havoc once the mall has closed. The next morning, the mall manager and Chief Wiggum see the mess that Bart and Milhouse have created and blindly jumps to the conclusion that it was caused by a giant rat, closing the mall as a result. He releases a puma inside the mall to catch the rat, but Bart and Milhouse use a ball of yarn to distract the puma and escape. Chief Wiggum later sees a piece of red yarn hanging from the mountain lion's mouth and thinks it is the rat's tail, which prompts him to declare that the case is closed and to not focus on putting the puma back in its cage.\n\n\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\" was written by Julie Thacker and directed by Nancy Kruse as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). Thacker came up with the story when she started enrolling her five daughters into dance classes during the summer. In a DVD audio commentary for the episode, she noted that she did not particularly like the teachers' methods and the other children's rude parents. Vicki Valentine, Lisa's tap dance teacher in the episode, is based on the American former child actress Shirley Temple. The character is voiced by regular cast member Tress MacNeille, although the part was originally offered to Temple herself, but she was unable to record the role. According to Pamela Klaffke, author of the 2003 book \"Spree: A Cultural History of Shopping\", the idea of \"being trapped inside the walls of a store or mall\" had become a \"cinematic cliché\" by the time this episode aired. She believes this cliché is what prompted the writers to do the story featuring Bart and Milhouse.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 7, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Julie Thacker, Yeardley Smith, and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. \n\n\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\" has received mixed reception from critics. \n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that neither the plot involving Lisa nor the subplot featuring Bart and Milhouse \"excels\", but that the latter is \"the superior of the two plots\". He added that \"We get some decent laughs from both of them and that’s about it.\" \n\nNancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the episodes she felt \"shined in season eleven\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1901851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901851", "title": "Aggie Memorial Stadium", "text": "Aggie Memorial Stadium\n\nAggie Memorial Stadium is an outdoor football stadium on the campus of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The stadium is the home field of the FBS independent New Mexico State Aggies. The venue opened on September 16, 1978 and the current seating capacity is 30,343. The artificial playing field sits at an elevation of 3,980 feet (1,213 m) above sea level. It is the former home of NM State Aggies women's soccer.\n\nPrior to 1978, the Aggies had played on the same site since 1933. Located just to the northeast of Hadley Hall (the university's Administration building), and originally known as Quesenberry Field, the original Memorial Stadium was built over it in 1950. It was dedicated as a memorial to New Mexico A&M students who had died in World War II, World War I, and the Spanish–American War, among whom was Henry C. Gilbert Jr., whose parents were instrumental in the 10-year-long fundraising drive. Memorial Stadium, which served for 28 seasons, was replaced both due to its small size (at maximum, the seating capacity was only 12,155) and the want of an expanded athletics plant with more infrastructure and parking. (Currently Memorial Tower, which was originally part of the press box of the stadium, is the only remaining reminder of the stadium. It is now structurally incorporated into the university's Health and Social Services building and houses a memorial lounge and computer lab.)\n\nThe \"new\" Aggie Memorial Stadium, dedicated to alumni who had served in the Korean War and Vietnam War, was built for $4 million over a period of 18 months. It was funded by the state legislature as part of a capital project on the campus. The first home game saw the Aggies defeat rival UTEP 35–32 on September 16, 1978. 20 years (and 10 days) later, the Aggies and Miners played to the largest crowd in stadium history, with 32,993 in attendance to see the Aggies win again, 33–24.\n\nThe stadium, designed by alumnus Craig Protz of Bohering-Protz Associates, was built just to the south of the Pan American Center, the home of Aggie basketball. The stadium boasts a unique design in which earth that was excavated to construct the lower bowl and field level was moved to the sides of the stadium to support the upper level, with a street level concourse dividing the lower and upper bowls. The first level of seating wraps around the field, except for two wide gaps behind each end zone. The southern end is a grass berm, with the Fulton Athletics Center, a $6 million structure constructed in 2004 housing athletics offices, an athletic training and education center, and club facilities, behind it. The northern end leads to the locker room facilities and main entrance to the stadium. Because of these gaps it was previously impossible to access the east side of the stadium from the west, and vice versa, without exiting the stadium and re-entering on the other side. A bridge over the north ramp constructed prior to the 2006 season now allows fans to cross from one side of the stadium to the other. The seating extends to a rounded second level on either side of the field, which extends the length of the playing field. The curved, undulating design of the upper level is reminiscent of similarly designed structures such as Memphis' Liberty Bowl Stadium and the now-demolished Tampa Stadium, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale.\n\nThe original four pole sodium vapor lighting system is now augmented by four additional smaller poles added prior to the 2005 season to increase the stadium's lighting capacity for televised night games. For the 2007 season, a new $1.5 million scoreboard including a 38'x23' video screen has been added to the facility, as well as a new team meeting and video room complex adjacent to the field house on the stadium's north end.\n\nIn addition to football, the stadium occasionally hosts major concerts and other large outdoor gatherings on campus.\n\nArtists that have performed at the stadium include Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Faith No More, The Eagles, Vans Warped Tour & Paul McCartney, among others.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 renovation of the nearby Pan American Center, the stadium hosted the university's commencement ceremonies, although they returned to the Pan Am following completion of the renovations. Also, Mayfield High School and Las Cruces High School play against each other in the stadium every year in November. (Varsity only). Starting in November 2017, Onate High School and Centennial High School will play each other in the stadium to start a new tradition.\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed The Swamp, it is the home field of Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns athletics. Cajun Field is primarily used for its American football team. Cajun Field has an official capacity of 41,426 with 2,577 chairback seats.\n\nIn planning since at least 1967 (when a rendition was featured on the football media guide), it was built in 1970 as a replacement for McNaspy Stadium, opening on September 25, 1971 with a shutout of Santa Clara University. The stadium consists of a bowl with seating on the sidelines, with a second deck on the west sideline. In one of the biggest games at the stadium, on September 14, 1996, 38,783 spectators saw the Cajuns upset 25th-ranked Texas A&M, 29–22, the first victory for the Cajuns over a ranked opponent. The largest crowd at The Swamp was 41,357 fans on September 5, 2009, when the Cajuns beat Southern University 42–19 at the 9th annual Herbert Heymann Football Classic.\n\nThe stadium won the Sun Belt Conference Attendance Championship in 2004, 2008, and 2011.\n\nBecause of Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 New Orleans Bowl was played here instead of in New Orleans, with Southern Miss defeating Arkansas State, 31–19. Also the Tulane Green Wave football team used it for a home game in 2005 after being displaced by the hurricane.\n\nIn addition, Cajun Field hosted the final pre-season game of the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League on February 18, 1984, a 20–0 victory over the Memphis Showboats.\n\nIn 1992, Cajun Field saw the attendance rise from 26,000 to 31,000 due to an upgrade to the ends of the stadium seating.\n\nIn the summer of 2008 Cajun Field replaced its long-standing natural grass with ProGrass, an artificial turf. The stadium was pressure-washed and repainted. Advertisements and banners reading \"University of Louisiana at Lafayette,\" \"Ragin' Cajuns,\" and \"www.ragincajuns.com\" also were installed around the black retaining wall that surrounds the field.\n\nIn spring 2014, construction of the south endzone seating began. This first phase project included bowling in the south endzone with new bleacher seating as well as concession and restroom facilities. This change has increased capacity to 41,426 and was completed for the 2014 season kickoff. Daktronics also installed a HD screen in the north endzone, replacing the previous scoreboard \n\nCajun Field's surface is two feet below sea level in a natural bowl. With the below-sea level playing surface, a total of four pumps and a sophisticated drainage system help keep the field in good playing condition even during the frequent south Louisiana rainstorms. The subsurface stadium requires many fans to walk down to their seats. Ragin' Cajuns football players and their opponents enter Cajun Field through a tunnel from the Louisiana athletics complex.\n\nIn 1988 the stadium was nicknamed \"The Swamp,\" as then noted on stadium signage, in the school yearbook and, a year later, in the 1989 official Southwestern Louisiana sports media guide. The nickname is tied to the field's early 1970s construction, and even refers to the original football field for what was then the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute in the early 1900s. The university's first football field was on the main campus adjacent to a small cypress pond, which later became Cypress Lake, also nicknamed \"The Swamp\".\n\nThe \"Swamp\" nickname also fits with the area's geography, with many bayous and wetlands, including the Atchafalaya Basin and the nearby Gulf of Mexico marshlands. The National Wetlands Research Center, a United States Geological Survey research facility at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, is less than half a mile from Cajun Field.\n\nDivision I FBS Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at the University of Florida was later also nicknamed \"The Swamp\" by then-Gators head coach Steve Spurrier in 1991.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901866", "title": "Dix Stadium", "text": "Dix Stadium\n\nDix Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Kent, Ohio, United States. It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Kent State Golden Flashes football team. In addition, since 2016 the stadium is also home to the Kent State women's soccer team and since 2019 to the women's lacrosse team. Previously, it was home to the Kent State field hockey team from 1997 to 2004 and served as a secondary home for the KSU men's soccer team in the 1970s. It opened on September 13, 1969 and was named in 1973 after Robert C. Dix, former publisher of the \"Record-Courier\" and a member of Kent State's Board of Trustees for more than three decades. It was built as an expansion and relocation of Memorial Stadium, with all of Memorial Stadium's main seating areas used at the current stadium in a new configuration.\n\nDix Stadium is located at the far eastern end of the KSU campus along Summit Street, just east of State Route 261 and is the center of an athletic complex, adjacent to the Kent State Field House, Murphy–Mellis Field, the Diamond at Dix, and Zoeller Field. The stadium hosts high school football games on a regular basis and served as the host of the 2001 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Championship, the 1998 and 2003 Mid-American Conference Field Hockey Tournaments, and the 2016 Mid-American Conference Women's Soccer Tournament. \nThe stadium consists of three separate grandstands on each side of the field except the south side, and has a seating capacity of 25,319. The west side grandstand, which includes the press box, is the largest section of seating, and the east side student seating is the smallest. On either side of the east grandstands are spaces for party tents, and the south end zone features the scoreboard and an open plaza. Although the first night game was held in 1990, permanent lights were not added until 1996. Artificial turf was installed in 1997 and replaced in 2005 with the latest version of FieldTurf. Prior to the 2002 season, the old east side stands, remnants of the Memorial Stadium, were demolished. The current east side bleachers were constructed after the 2002 season and were completed in time for the 2003 season opener. In early 2008, the south end zone bleachers, another remnant of the old stadium, were razed as part of a two-phase renovation of the facility. At its dedication, the stadium was listed as having a seating capacity of 30,520, reduced to 29,287 in 2003 after the east side seating was replaced.\n\nPrior to the opening of Dix Stadium, the Golden Flashes football team played home games at Memorial Stadium, which was located adjacent to what is now known as the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center. Memorial Stadium opened in 1950, though the team had been playing on the site since 1941. By 1965, Memorial Stadium had been expanded to seat 20,000 people from its original 5,600. Enrollment growth and construction of new academic buildings in the 1950s and early 1960s meant that the Memorial Stadium site, which had previously been the edge of campus, was instead becoming its physical center. In 1964, continued and forecasted enrollment growth at Kent State led to discussion on building a new University Center in the area partially occupied by the stadium, to include a new student center and library along with additional parking and new classroom buildings for science. Early plans for the stadium called for it to seat 55,000 and be located in the southwest corner of the campus, adjacent to the site of what is now Schoonover Stadium. By 1966, the university had purchased land near the corner of Horning Road and Summit Road in Franklin Township. Preliminary plans call for an athletic complex centered on a new stadium seating between 40,000 and 55,000 people to be opened in 1969, with parking for 9,000 cars. Later plans called for the complex to include a 15,000-seat arena and a field house with an indoor track.\n\nDix Stadium, known as Memorial Stadium until 1973, was regarded as an \"expansion and relocation\" of Memorial Stadium rather than an entirely new stadium. A new grandstand on the west side of the stadium, with seating for over 12,000 people and locker room and press facilities, was constructed on the new site, along Summit Road just over east of campus. Approximately 17,000 seats from Memorial Stadium were dismantled and moved to the new site. Memorial Stadium's sideline grandstands became the end zone seats in the new stadium, while the auxiliary bleacher sections were used for the east stands.\nThe first game at Dix Stadium was on September 13, 1969, a 24–14 win over the Dayton Flyers in front of 8,172 fans. Because of delays, the new west stands, including the home and visitor locker rooms, press box, and most of the seating, were not completed until after the 1969 football season, limiting the seating capacity to 18,200. For the first season, the teams dressed in the locker rooms at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center and were bused to the stadium. At halftime, the teams met in separate public restroom facilities. The \"new\" Memorial Stadium was dedicated in 1970 and renamed Dix Stadium in honor of longtime Kent State trustee and Record-Courier publisher Robert C. Dix in 1973. Its initial seating capacity was listed at 28,748 before later being revised to 30,520, which stood through the 2001 season.\n\nThe first major changes to Dix Stadium began in 1992 when an elevator was added to reach the press box and suites, and in 1996 when permanent lighting was added. Night games had been played since 1990, but with temporary lighting. A new scoreboard and artificial turf were installed in 1997, which allowed the field hockey team to begin play at the stadium. The field hockey team played home games at Dix Stadium through the 2004 season before moving to the adjacent Murphy-Mellis Field in 2005. After the east side bleachers were condemned and demolished in 2001, the area remained open for the entire 2002 season. Prior to the start of the 2003 season, a new section of bleacher seating was built as the student section, bringing the total seating capacity to 29,287.\n\nIn 2007, a two-phase renovation of the stadium started. Phase one included construction of a large canopy over the press box, new entrance gates, and a ticket office, all completed prior to the 2007 season opener. Phase two included the demolition of the south end zone seats and the former press box atop the seats in the north end zone, and construction of a new HD scoreboard, concession area, and plaza in the sound end zone area. The removal of the approximately 5,000 seats in the south end zone reduced the stadium's seating capacity to 25,319.\n\nDix Stadium is laid out with the football field running north–south, with separate seating areas on the west, north, and east sides. The west stands, often referred to as the \"home stands\", are the largest and include the locker rooms and player facilities beneath them, the press box and suites, and both bleacher and chair back seating for over 12,000 fans. The east stands, built in 2003 to replace the original wooden bleachers, are the smallest section and are the primary student section, with bleacher seating for over 4,000 fans. The north end zone, which is the original grandstand of old Memorial Stadium, is also entirely made up of bleacher seats. A large plaza, concession area, and the scoreboard are located in the south end zone. \nWhen it first opened, the stadium had four major seating areas, with the new west stands and the seating moved from old Memorial Stadium on the other three sides of the field. Initial long-range plans for the stadium called for it to eventually be expanded to seat 50,000 people. The original east stands, which were wooden bleachers considered temporary, were to be removed by 1973 and replaced with permanent seating. This section was to have been 18 rows initially, and would have eventually been expanded to duplicate the west stands, increasing capacity to approximately 35,000. The final phase would have been to add a second deck on both sides. Changes to the seating capacity, however, would not come for 31 years when the east side bleachers were condemned and demolished following the 2001 season.\n\nThe first official game listed as a sell-out occurred on October 9, 2010 when 24,221 fans were on hand for the Flashes' 28–17 win over arch-rival Akron in the Battle for the Wagon Wheel. The crowd ranks as the third-largest crowd to see a game at Dix Stadium, surpassed by two games in 1973: 25,137 against Bowling Green on October 13, and 27,363 against Miami on November 10.\n\nDix Stadium is located along Summit Street in Kent, just east of the intersection of Summit Street and Ohio State Route 261, on the eastern edge of the Kent State University main campus. The stadium was annexed into the city of Kent in 2002 after having previously been part of Franklin Township. Adjacent to the stadium are facilities and practice fields for several other Kent State athletic teams. When the stadium was built, a cinder track was included on the site, northeast of the stadium. While the track is no longer used for competitions, it surrounds Zoeller Field, the home of the Kent State women's soccer team. Zoeller Field was constructed in 1990 as the home of the field hockey team, becoming the home of the women's soccer team in 1997. It was upgraded in 2010.\n\nImmediately east of Dix Stadium and south of Zoeller Field is the Kent State Field House, built in 1990 and expanded in 2014. It includes a full-sized football field, track, weight training facilities, and locker rooms. It is primarily used by the football team for training and practice and the indoor track and field teams for practice and meets. Other KSU sports such as baseball and softball use the field house for practice during winter months. South of Dix Stadium is the Diamond at Dix, the home of the Kent State softball team, with Murphy-Mellis Field, the home of the KSU field hockey team, adjacent on the north along with two natural grass practice fields for football. The Diamond at Dix opened in 1999 and Murphy-Mellis Field opened in 2005.\n\nIn 2013, the university began the $60 million \"Building Champions\" campaign to upgrade facilities for all of Kent State's athletic teams as well as raise additional scholarship money. The first project was expansion of the Field House with new locker rooms for indoor track and field, women's soccer, field hockey, and softball, as well as concession areas and restrooms for fans. The plans include additional changes to both Dix Stadium and the surrounding athletic complex. Among the changes planned are a new Zoeller Field south of the Field House and east of Dix Stadium with seating for 2,150 and a new all-weather track surrounding a soccer field. Additionally, a new parking lot would be built north of the Field House where the current Zoeller Field stands. In front of Dix Stadium, the Diamond at Dix would be removed and a new parking area for alumni would be built in its place, with a new softball stadium being built adjacent to Olga Mural Field at Schoonover Stadium.\n\nImprovements planned for Dix Stadium include expanded chairback seating and suite upgrades on the west stands, a new building for the coaches' offices on the north of the stadium, and improvements to the locker room and other player facilities, including a new players' lounge. On the east side, two covered seating areas for students would be built adjacent to the existing student seating.\n\nIn addition to being the home venue for the Kent State football team since 1969 and for the Kent State field hockey team from 1997 through the 2004 season, Dix Stadium has also been used for a number of other events. It is a regular host for high school football games, usually Ohio High School Athletic Association playoff games. From 1997–1999, the stadium was the site of the annual rivalry game between Theodore Roosevelt High School and Ravenna High School. In 1998, the OHSAA Division I state semifinal between Canton McKinley High School and Cleveland Saint Ignatius High School was played at the stadium in front of a near sellout crowd. The stadium hosted two state playoff games in 2012, an opening round game between Theodore Roosevelt High School and Ellet High School in Division II and a Division I second-round game between Canton McKinley High School and Massillon Washington High School that drew an estimated 20,000 fans.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1981, the Cleveland Browns held their training camp on the campus of Kent State University and used the stadium and practice fields. In 1980, a controlled scrimmage with the Buffalo Bills held in the stadium drew 26,758 fans. During the field hockey team's tenure at Dix Stadium, it was the site of the Mid-American Conference Field Hockey Tournament in 1998 and 2003, and of the semifinal and championship rounds of the 2001 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Championship, held November 16 through 18. It was the first time Kent State had hosted a national championship event since the 1967 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships were held at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, and the first national championship hosted by a MAC school since 1992. The 2016 Mid-American Women's Soccer Tournament was held at Dix Stadium, with the semifinals played November 4 and the championship match played November 6, won by the Flashes. It marked the first time Kent State hosted the MAC tournament and was the first time Kent State won the tournament. In preparation for hosting the MAC Tournament, the KSU women's soccer team most of their home games in the 2016 season at the stadium, which is adjacent to their home venue, Zoeller Field. The previous season, the team hosted its opening round match in the MAC tournament at Dix Stadium. In the 1970s, Dix Stadium was used by the KSU men's soccer team for occasional matches until the team disbanded in 1980.\n\nFrom 1970 through 1973, the university's May commencement ceremony was held there, but was moved back to the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center in 1974, where it has remained since. The stadium again hosted commencement in July 1991 because of renovations at the MAC Center. Shortly after the inauguration of university president Lester Lefton in 2006, he announced plans to have one large commencement ceremony at Dix Stadium to begin in 2008, but the plans were later canceled. The stadium was used again for commencement in May 2017 for Kent State's first \"One University Commencement Ceremony\", which included students from all eight KSU campuses. The 2017 program was highlighted by keynote speaker Octavia Spencer. The facility has also been used as a concert venue, most recently in 2012 as part of the university's Centennial Campaign when Sheryl Crow and Los Lonely Boys played there. It was the first concert held at the stadium in 25 years.\n\nDuring the filming for the movie \"Draft Day\", the stadium was used as a stand-in for Ohio Stadium in a scene that depicts a football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Wisconsin Badgers. Dix Stadium was chosen because of its proximity to Cleveland, where most of the filming for the movie was taking place. Filming took place May 18, 2013 primarily in the north end zone and included a number of local extras as fans, the addition of the Ohio State \"Block O\" on the center of the football field, and the placing of Ohio State padding on the south end goal post.\n\n"}

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Bowling Green Falcons football team. It opened in 1966 and originally held 23,232 people.\n\nOn October 1, 1966, the stadium opened with a 13–0 win over Dayton. The stadium was named for Doyt Perry, a highly successful coach and athletic director at the school. It was meant to replace University Stadium, a WPA stadium in the heart of campus which lasted 43 seasons. In 1975 the stadium hosted the Poe Ditch Music Festival. On October 8, 1983, the annual Toledo-Bowling Green football game established a school and MAC attendance record of 33,527.\n\nFor the 2007 football season the stadium received an upgrade. The Sebo Center was built and enclosed the north endzone. It houses band seating, luxury suites, offices, training facilities and new box offices. The grass field was also replaced with a Fieldturf artificial surface. Nevertheless, Doyt Perry Stadium has the second smallest capacity of any stadium among schools in the MAC - ahead of only Ball State University's Scheumann Stadium. Additionally in 2007, the stadium underwent further renovations, complying with new NCAA seating regulations which increased the listed capacity from 23,272 to 24,000.\n\nThe stadium consists of two bowed sideline grandstands. The stadium also featured steel grandstands at the north and south ends. The south grandstands were removed to make way for a merchandise tent and a pavilion for the Falcon Club boosters. The north grandstand was removed to facilitate the construction of the Sebo Athletic Center. Through the 2019 season, the Falcons have a 172-103-6 record at Doyt Perry Stadium.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901879", "title": "Ratchet: Deadlocked", "text": "Ratchet: Deadlocked\n\nRatchet: Deadlocked (known as Ratchet: Gladiator in Europe, Australia and South Africa) is a 2005 platformer in the \"Ratchet & Clank\" series, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe game's story begins as Ratchet, Clank, and Al are abducted and forced to compete in \"DreadZone\", a violent game show in which heroes are forced to kill each other. Ratchet is given a \"DeadLock\" collar, which will explode if he becomes uncooperative or boring. The three must find a way to deactivate the collars and free the other heroes being held prisoner. \"Deadlocked\" was the last \"Ratchet & Clank\" game to be rated T, despite the introduction of the E10+ rating earlier that year.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of other games in the series, but focuses more on shooter aspects rather than platforming. The player, as Ratchet, fights in DreadZone tournaments across the \"Shadow Sector\" in the \"Solana\" Galaxy, with a large variety of weapons. This game was the first in the series to feature cooperative gameplay in a story mode, and also includes an online multiplayer mode. Some vehicles return from previous games, and new ones are introduced. For the first time, Clank (in his typical form) was not a playable character.\n\n\"Deadlocked\" was met with generally favorable reviews, although slightly lower than its predecessors, with some criticism being aimed at its darker tone, repetitive gameplay and level design, and the removal of Clank as a playable character.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Deadlocked\" is similar to that of previous \"Ratchet & Clank\" games, with a combination of shooting, action, and platforming, although it focuses more on shooter aspects of the series, with very little platforming. \"Deadlocked\" was the first game in the \"Ratchet and Clank\" series to have an adjustable difficulty level, and is also the first to have a cooperative story mode with two players.\n\nThe player controls Ratchet from a third-person perspective, competing in missions and tournaments, defeating enemies, or occasionally controlling vehicles. \"Combat Bots\", two robots which follow the player in most missions, give Ratchet extra firepower, and perform several tasks for him, such as planting explosives. Combat bots can be upgraded and given new paint schemes, head designs, and weapons. After completing missions, the player is awarded a certain amount of \"Dreadpoints\" and bolts, the game's form of currency. Bolts can also be picked up from defeated enemies, or found in hidden \"Jackpot\" crates.\n\nThere are ten weapons in \"Deadlocked\", fewer than most other games in the series. Weapons can be modified using a large range of \"Alpha\" and \"Omega\" mods, which improve weapon abilities. Alpha mods improve statistics such as rate-of-fire and ammunition capacity, while Omega mods add a secondary effect to weapons, such as napalm, or the ability to freeze enemies. The Omega mods can only be equipped if a weapon supports that type of it (\"Remember: some weapons aren't compatible with certain Omega mods\"). As the player progresses, more weapons and mods become available, such as the \"Arbiter\", a rocket launcher, and the \"Magma Cannon\", a shotgun-like weapon. Weapons and mods are bought from vendors, which also sell ammunition, using bolts. As weapons gain experience, they will upgrade to more powerful versions, to a maximum of level 10 (further upgrades, however, can still be bought in \"challenge mode\"). The game's health system, Nanotech, can also be upgraded through experience. Whenever the player takes damage, it can be partially restored by breaking nanotech crates.\n\nClank, Ratchet's robotic best friend, is only a playable character if his skin is unlocked, and cannot be used as a jet-pack device by Ratchet, unlike older games. Instead, he acts as mission control, giving the player advice during gameplay. A skin for a second player in cooperative mode, however, named \"Alpha Clank\", can be used.\n\nIn cooperative mode, the second player takes the place of the combat bots. The Bot's gadgets can be used by the players instead, when necessary. Players in cooperative mode must share weapons and ammunition supply, and as a result, both players cannot use the same weapon at the same time.\n\nThere are 4 playable vehicles throughout \"Deadlocked\". The \"Hovership\", a laser equipped aircraft, the \"Puma\", a type of armored car, and the \"Landstalker\", essentially a large platform with four spider-like mechanical legs and weapons, can all be used by two players simultaneously at any time. The \"Hoverbike\", a hovering vehicle used for both racing and combat, can only be used by one player.\n\nAfter completing the game, the player may choose to enter \"challenge mode\". In challenge mode, weapons can be upgraded further, more mods can be purchased, and additional \"extras\" are made available such as a new difficulty level even harder than the previously available toughest difficulty.\n\nThe game also features online and local multiplayer modes. Up to 4 players may play locally in offline multiplayer matches. The online mode supports a USB Keyboard and a USB Headset, and all levels from single player are available in multiplayer. Players can play in \"Conquest\" mode, in which teams try to capture territory, \"Deathmatch\" mode, where players gain points by killing each other, \"Capture the Flag\" mode, where up to four teams attempt to capture their opponent's flags, \"King of the Hill\" mode, where players gain points by staying in a holographic circle, and \"Juggernaut\" mode, similar to deathmatch, but where one player has vastly improved abilities.\n\nFollowing the events of \"\", Ratchet, Clank and Big Al have been given the job of running the Starship Phoenix. After the crew are informed that many heroes have disappeared, robot troops overrun the Phoenix, taking Ratchet, Clank, and Al captive.\n\nThey are transported to the Shadow Sector, a lawless region of the Solana Galaxy. Ratchet meets Gleeman Vox, the creator of DreadZone, a barbaric game show in which contestants are forced to kill each other. Ratchet is forced to compete in DreadZone, and is fitted with a \"DeadLock\" collar which will explode if he becomes uncooperative or boring. Collectively referred to as \"Team DarkStar\", Ratchet and his combat bots, Merc and Green must fight for their lives while Clank serves as Ratchet's \"Mission Engineer\".\n\nRatchet competes in a variety of DreadZone challenges, quickly becoming DreadZone's most popular contestant despite Vox's numerous slander campaigns against him, leaving Dreadzone's previous star, Ace Hardlight jealous. Ratchet is eventually sent to compete against Ace, who Ratchet defeats. As Ratchet leaves, Ace tells him to not let Vox corrupt him. Afterwards, Vox offers to make Ratchet a new exterminator and turn him into DreadZone's superstar, but he is enraged when Ratchet refuses and decides to have him participate in an arena scientifically proven to be unbeatable, which he narrowly wins.\n\nMeanwhile, Clank devises a plan to escape from the DreadZone facility by reprogramming the arena transport pod to take Ratchet to the station's control level. Here, he can destroy the central computer and deactivate the containment field holding all of the heroes hostage.\n\nUpon his arrival at the control level, Ratchet discovers that Vox has wired the station to explode, and if Ratchet cannot deactivate the explosives, everyone there will die. Running a massive gauntlet of enemies and destroying the station's power generators, Ratchet deactivates the containment fields and unlocks the station's escape shuttles. After being defeated by Ratchet, Vox manually activates the station's self-destruct sequence, planning to kill both himself and Ratchet.\n\nThe last shuttle, however, piloted by Al, swoops in to rescue Ratchet. Ratchet climbs aboard and Clank removes his DeadLock collar. The DreadZone station explodes soon afterwards, taking Vox with it. After the credits, Doctor Nefarious and his butler, Lawrence make a cameo appearance, still trapped on an asteroid. Nefarious states that they were supposed to be coming in range of a space station, to which Lawrence retorts he had no idea it was going to explode. Nefarious gets angry and short-circuits, and a clip from the soap opera \"Lance and Janice\" plays as the game ends. Afterwards it is informed that The Plumber was unable to make an appearance in the game \"due to a sump dump on the Rygyllian Nebula\".\n\n\"Deadlocked\" was released in North America on October 25, 2005, and in Japan on November 23, 2005. It was released as \"Ratchet: Gladiator\" in Europe and Australia on November 18, 2005, and November 24, 2005, respectively. The PlayStation 2 Online Servers were terminated on June 28, 2012.\n\nA high-definition remaster of \"Deadlocked\" on PlayStation 3 was developed for release on the PlayStation Network since the game was not available on the \"Ratchet & Clank Collection\" where it only featured \"Deadlocked\"'s three predecessors. Those who have purchased \"\" received the HD remastered game for free on May 21 as an apology due to the long-awaited PlayStation Vita version of \"Full Frontal Assault\". The online servers for the PlayStation 3 were terminated on February 15, 2018, along with \"Up Your Arsenal\" on the PS3 the same day.\n\nIn 2006, \"Deadlocked\" was added to Sony's Greatest Hits range for North America. It was similarly added to Sony's Platinum range for PAL regions on May 12, 2006, and to Japan's The Best range on June 29, 2006.\n\n"}

The family lived at No 7, Blythswood Square, Glasgow, at the crown of the new developments by William Harley on Blythswood Hill, and also had a country property, \"Rowaleyn\", near Helensburgh.\n\nSmith broke the strict Victorian conventions of the time when, as a young woman in early 1855, she began a secret love affair with Pierre Emile L'Angelier, some ten years her senior, an apprentice nurseryman who originally came from the Channel Islands. He worked as a packing clerk in a warehouse at 10 Bothwell Street nearby.\n\nThe pair would meet late at night, at Smith's bedroom window and also engaged in voluminous correspondence. During one of their infrequent meetings alone, she lost her virginity to L'Angelier.\n\nSmith's parents, unaware of the affair with L'Angelier (whom Smith had promised to marry) found a suitable fiancé for her within the Glasgow upper-middle class, William Harper Minnoch.\n\nSmith attempted to break her connection with L'Angelier and, in February 1857, asked him to return the letters she had written to him. Instead, L'Angelier threatened to use the letters to expose her and force her to marry him. She was soon observed in a druggist's office, ordering arsenic, which she signed for as M.H. Smith.\n\nEarly on the morning of 23 March 1857, L'Angelier died from arsenic poisoning. He is buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street in Glasgow.\n\nAfter his death, Madeleine Smith's numerous letters were found in the house where he lodged, and she was arrested and charged with his murder.\n\nAt trial, Smith was defended by advocate John Inglis (later known as Lord Glencorse). Toxicological evidence, confirming that the victim had died of arsenic poisoning, was given by Andrew Douglas Maclagan.\n\nAlthough the circumstantial evidence pointed towards her guilt (Smith had made purchases of arsenic in the weeks leading up to L'Angelier's death, and had a clear motive) the jury returned a verdict of \"not proven\", i.e. the jury was unconvinced that Smith was innocent, but the prosecution had produced insufficient evidence to the contrary.\n\nCrucial to the case was the chronology of certain letters from Smith to l'Angelier, and as the letters themselves were undated, the case hinged to some extent on the envelopes. One letter in particular depended on the correct interpretation of the date of the postmark which was unfortunately illegible, and attracted some caustic comments from the judge; but the vast majority of these postmarks were quite clearly struck. It transpired that when the police searched L'Angelier's room, many of Smith's letters were found without their envelopes and were then hurriedly collected and stuck into whichever envelopes came to hand.\n\nOn 4 July 1861, she married an artist named George Wardle, William Morris's business manager. They had one son (Thomas, born 1864) and one daughter (Mary, called \"Kitten\", born 1863). For a time, she became involved with the Fabian Society in London, and sometimes made the coffee at meetings. As she was known by her new married name, not everyone knew who she was, but a few did. \n\nAfter many years of marriage, she and her husband separated in 1889 and Madeleine moved to New York City. Around 1916, she married a second time to William A. Sheehy and this marriage lasted until his death in 1926.\n\nShe died in 1928 and was buried under the name of Lena Wardle Sheehy.\n\nAs in the case of Lizzie Borden, scholars and amateur criminologists have spent decades going over the \"minutiae\" of the case.\n\nMost modern scholars believe that Smith committed the crime and the only thing that saved her from a guilty verdict and a death sentence was that no eyewitness could prove that Smith and l'Angellier had met in the weeks before his death.\n\nAfter the trial, \"The Scotsman\" ran a small article stating that a witness had come forward claiming that a young male and female were seen outside Smith's house on the night of l'Angellier's death. However, the trial was already in progress, and the witness could not be questioned during it.\n\nSmith's story was the basis for several plays and the David Lean film \"Madeleine\" (1950). Jack House's book \"Square Mile of Murder\" (1961), which contains a section on Smith, formed the basis for a BBC television version in 1980. A television play based upon the case, \"Killer in Close-Up: The Trial Of Madeleine Smith\", written by George F. Kerr, was also produced by Sydney television station ABN-2, broadcast on 13 August 1958.\n\nThe case was an inspiration for Wilkie Collins' novel \"The Law and the Lady\" (1875), though the only main similar features were the problem of the Scottish \"Not Proven\" verdict and arsenic poisoning as a means for murder.\n\nIn the early 1930s, MGM starred Joan Crawford, Nils Asther and Robert Montgomery in a film called \"Letty Lynton\", which was based on a 1931 novel of the same title by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. This film closely follows Madeleine's story, except that Crawford's character is never charged and, in an example of pre-code Hollywood, gets away with murder. The film is not presently available due to a copyright suit filed shortly after the film's release in 1932.\n\nThe case was again dramatized in 1952 for Mutual Radio in an episode of The Black Museum titled \"The Small White Boxes\".\n\nOther novels based on the case include \"The House in Queen Anne's Square\" (1920) by William Darling Lyell, \"Lovers All Untrue\" (1970) by Norah Lofts, and \"Alas, for Her That Met Me!\" (1976) by Mary Ann Ashe (pseudonym of Christianna Brand).\n\nFrom 1976 to 1989 Madeleine Smith was one of the figures in the Chamber of Horrors section in the Edinburgh Wax Museum on the Royal Mile.\n\n\n\n"}

Best known as the home of the Drake Relays, it also serves as the home field of the university's football team. It opened in 1925.\n\nDrake Stadium opened on October 10, 1925, as the Bulldogs defeated Kansas. \n\nDrake Stadium has seen the Bulldogs win thirteen conference championships in football, while advancing to five college football bowl games. The stadium is also the home field for nearby Des Moines Roosevelt High School and occasional home games for Dowling High School. It is currently the largest stadium in the Pioneer Football League.\n\nDrake Stadium is also the home to the Drake Relays, one of the premier track and field meets in the country. Thousands of high school, college, and professional track athletes come to Drake Stadium in late April to compete in one of the largest track meets in the United States. The prominence of the Relays has led to Drake hosting various other national and regional professional, collegiate, and youth meets. Fourteen world records have been set at the Relays. \n\nThe stadium also hosts the Iowa boys and girls high school track state championships. \n\nIt also serves as a secondary venue for the university's men's and women's soccer teams. In 2019, the Des Moines Menace, a local USL League Two soccer club, played its home schedule at the stadium.\n\nThe football field at Drake Stadium is named in honor of Drake alumnus and football great Johnny Bright. The track is named after famed announcer Jim Duncan.\n\nThe installation of a $175,000 tartan track in 1969 replaced the cinder track. It was a magnificent 60th birthday present for Drake Relays competitors and fans. In 1976, all individual events at the Drake Relays went metric; in 1978, the conversion was completed with rebuilding of the track into a 400-meter oval so that relay races, too, could go metric. The Jim Duncan Track was resurfaced in the summer of 1989 in Drake blue school colors, featuring a combination of polyurethane coating and EPDM rubber granules. Since this installation, track and field athletes and fans frequently refer to the venue as the \"Blue Oval\". \n\nThe 2005–2006 renovation project improved many aspects of the stadium. The surface area of the stadium was flattened (previously the infield sat several feet lower than the track surface). It created a reconfigured track to meet NCAA and international standards, improved seating, and added a \"safety lane\" on the outside of the track for athletes (in the old configuration, fans could easily make contact with a competitor in lane 8). In addition, a new scoreboard with video screen was placed at the northeast corner of the stadium. Widening the track reduced the stadium's seating capacity from 18,000 to 14,557. As a result, throwing events were moved to an area north of the stadium.\n\nThe Bulldogs played their 2005 home games at Waukee High School's Warrior Stadium due to renovations at the stadium.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, the field and track were resurfaced. New turf was installed and the track surface was replaced using the same material used at the Beijing and London Summer Olympics.\n\nDrake Stadium has hosted the NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships on four occasions:\n\nThe 2008 championships doubled the previous four-day record crowd with a total attendance of 41,187 (including over 11,000 for the final day) despite heavy flooding in Des Moines.\n\nDrake Stadium has also hosted the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships four times:\n\nAdditionally, the facility has hosted the AAU Junior Olympic Games four times.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was used for 64 seasons before being replaced by McLane Stadium in 2014. It was primarily used for football, and was the home field of the Baylor Bears. The stadium, located about four miles from the Baylor University campus, cost $1.8 million to build and sat 50,000 people. Originally named Baylor Stadium, it opened in 1950 with a Baylor game against the Houston Cougars. On December 7, 2013, Baylor played its last game in the stadium, against the Texas Longhorns, where the attendance record of 51,728 was established. Baylor won 19 of its final 20 games played at the stadium.\n\nOriginally known as Baylor Stadium, the stadium was renamed at halftime of the November 5, 1988 homecoming game when it was renamed for Floyd Casey by his son, university trustee and longtime booster Carl B. Casey of Dallas, who gave US$5 million towards an $8 million stadium renovation project.\n\nThe stadium was renovated several times. Turf was first introduced to the stadium in 1972. Then in 1998, the stadium installed SportGrass, a leading artificial grass surface. In 2005, it underwent massive renovations to extend the Grant Teaff Plaza in honor of former head coach Grant Teaff. The extended plaza created much-needed updates to the stadium's façade.\n\nThe stadium was an elongated oval shape, running southeast-northwest, with large grandstands on the sidelines. The south end zone was cleared, with athletic marks painted on the ground and the large LED scoreboard behind it. (Prior to the creation of the current athletic marks, the area was painted gold, with \"BAYLOR\" painted in large green block letters.) In 2004, a large tarp was installed that covered the south end zone and could be removed when ticket demand necessitated it. With the tarp in place seating capacity was reduced to 47,000. The north end zone had seating in front of the Carl & Thelma Casey Athletic Center, site of the football offices, training facilities, and stadium field house.\n\nPrior to the building of the stadium, the Baylor football team played at Carroll Field, an on-campus field last used in 1935, and Waco's Municipal Stadium on Dutton Avenue.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Baylor regents approved a new on-campus stadium to be built on the Brazos River adjacent to Interstate 35.\n\nThe demolition of the stadium was completed on May 14, 2016.\n"}

Eisner produced two sequels set in the same tenement: \"A Life Force\" in 1988, and \"Dropsie Avenue\" in 1995. Though the term \"graphic novel\" did not originate with Eisner, the book is credited with popularizing its use.\n\nFour stand-alone stories make up the book: in \"A Contract with God\" a religious man gives up his faith after the death of his young adopted daughter; in \"The Street Singer\" a has-been diva tries to seduce a poor, young street singer, who tries to take advantage of her in turn; a bullying racist is led to suicide after false accusations of pedophilia in \"The Super\"; and \"Cookalein\" intertwines the stories of several characters vacationing in the Catskill Mountains. The stories are thematically linked with motifs of frustration, disillusionment, violence, and issues of ethnic identity. Eisner uses large, monochromatic images in dramatic perspective, and emphasizes the caricatured characters' facial expressions; few panels or captions have traditional borders around them.\n\nEisner began his comic book career in 1936 and had long held artistic ambitions for what was perceived as a lowbrow medium. He found no support for his ideas, and left the world of commercial comics after ending his signature work \"The Spirit\" in 1952. The growth of comics fandom convinced him to return in the 1970s, and he worked to realize his aspirations of creating comics with literary content. He wanted a mainstream publisher for the book and to have it sold in traditional bookstores, rather than in comic book shops; the small press Baronet Books released \"A Contract with God\" in 1978 and marketed it as a \"graphic novel\", which thereafter became the common term for book-length comics. It sold slowly at first, but gained respect from Eisner's peers, and since has been reprinted by larger publishers. \"A Contract with God\" cemented Eisner's reputation as an elder statesman of comics, and he continued to produce graphic novels and theoretical works on comics until his death in 2005.\n\n\"A Contract with God\" mixes melodrama with social realism. Following an author's introduction, \"A Tenement in the Bronx\", the book contains four stories set in a tenement building; they derive in part from Eisner's personal memories growing up in a tenement in the Bronx. With \"A Contract with God\" he aimed to explore an area of Jewish-American history that he felt was underdocumented, while showing that capable of mature literary expression, at a time when it received little such regard as an artistic medium. In the preface he stated his aim to keep the exaggeration in his cartooning within realistic limits.\n\nThe story \"A Contract with God\" drew from Eisner's feelings over the death at sixteen of his daughter Alice. In his introduction to the 2006 edition of the book, Eisner first wrote about it and the feelings he felt toward God that were reflected in the story. \"The Street Singer\" and \"The Super\" are fiction, but sprang from Eisner's memories of people he had met in the tenements of his youth. \"Cookalein\" was the most autobiographical—the main character \"Willie\" even carries Eisner's own boyhood nickname. Eisner remarked that \"it took a lot of determination, a kind of courage, to write that story\".\n\nThe stories' sexual content is prominent, though not in the gratuitous manner of ' celebration of hedonism, which contrasted with the conservative lifestyle of Eisner the middle-aged businessman. Eisner used no profanity in the book, and according to critic Josh Lambert the sex in \"Contract\" is not so much erotic as disturbing, the characters frustrated or filled with guilt.\n\nIn Russia, the young, deeply religious Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh carves a contract with God on a stone tablet to live a life of good deeds; he attributes to it his later success in life. He moves to New York, into a tenement building at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and lives a simple life devoted to God. He adopts an infant girl, Rachele, who is abandoned on his doorstep. When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. He abandons his faith, shaves his beard, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress. He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor. He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it. Eisner appended a page to the 2006 edition, depicting Shloime ascending the stairs to the tenement.\n\nEisner called the story's creation \"an exercise in personal anguish\" as he was still grieved and angered over his daughter Alice's death from leukemia at 16. In early sketches of the story, Eisner used her name for Hersh's adopted daughter, and expressed his own anguish through Hersh. He stated, \" argument with God was mine. I exorcised my rage at a deity that I believed violated my faith and deprived my lovely 16-year-old child of her life at the very flowering of it.\"\n\nMarta Maria, an aging opera singer, tries to seduce a young man, Eddie, whom she finds singing in the alleys between tenement buildings. She had given up her own singing career for an alcoholic husband; she hopes to get back into show business as mentor to Eddie, and gives him money for clothes. He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife, who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses. He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career, but is unable to find the aging diva again—he does not know her address, and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him.\n\nEisner based the story on memories of an unemployed man who made the rounds of tenements singing \"popular songs or off-key operatic operas\" for spare change. Eisner remembered throwing the street singer coins on occasion, and considered he \"was able to immortalize his story\" in \"The Street Singer\".\n\nThose who live in the tenement at 55 Dropsie Avenue fear and mistrust their antisemitic superintendent, Mr. Scuggs. The tenant Mrs. Farfell's young niece Rosie goes down to his apartment and offers him a peek at her panties for a nickel. After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs' dog and only companion, Hugo, and steals Scuggs's money. He corners her in an alley, where the tenants spot him and call the police, accusing him of trying to molest a minor. Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him, he shoots himself, embracing Hugo's body.\n\nEisner wrote that he based the superintendent on the \"mysterious but threatening custodian\" of his boyhood tenement. Eisner added a page to the 2006 edition in which a \"Super Wanted\" sign is posted on the tenement building, following the original conclusion of Rosie counting her stolen money.\n\n\"Cookalein\" is a story of tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country. To be alone with his mistress, a man named Sam sends his wife and children away to the Catskill Mountains, where they stay at a \"cookalein\" (Yiddish: , \"cook alone\", a place for boarders with access to a kitchen).\n\nA clothing cutter named Benny and a secretary named Goldie are staying at an expensive hotel near the cookalein, both hoping to find someone rich to marry; they mistake each other for a wealthy target, and when they discover this, Benny rapes Goldie. Herbie, an intern Goldie had earlier turned down, takes her into his care, and Benny goes on to court an heiress. An older woman seduces Sam's fifteen-year-old son Willie at the cookalein; they are discovered by her husband who, after beating her, makes love to her in front of the boy.\n\nAt the end of the summer, the vacationers return to Dropsie Avenue. Goldie and Herbie are engaged, and Benny believes he will be marrying into the diamond business. Willie is affected by his experiences, but does not express them, and his family plan to leave the tenement. For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a rear-view perspective, looking out from his balcony.\n\n\"Cookalein\" was the most overtly autobiographical of the stories—Eisner used the real names of his family members: his parents Sam and Fannie, his brother Petey, and himself, \"Willie\". Eisner called \"Cookalein\" \"an honest account of coming of age\" that was \"a combination of invention and recall\".\n\nWill Eisner was born in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants. He has said he wanted a career in the arts, but that poor Jews at the time were restricted from upper-class universities where he could study it. Like others of his generation, he turned to comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. In the late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the formally inventive \"The Spirit\", which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952. After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media. With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner found there was still interest in his decades-old \"Spirit\" comics, and that the fans wanted more work from him. After American Visuals went out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher to reprint old \"Spirit\" stories. Other reprints followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new \"Spirit\" stories—instead, he wanted to do something more serious, inspired in part by the wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938, and similar work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nückel.\n\nEisner had had greater artistic ambitions for comics since his time doing \"The Spirit\". Since the 1950s, he had been developing ideas for a book, but was unable to gain support for them, as was seen by both the public and its practitioners as low-status entertainment; at a meeting of the National Cartoonists Society in 1960, Rube Goldberg rebuked Eisner's ambitions, saying, \"You are a vaudevillian like the rest of us ... don't ever forget that!\"\n\nWith the critical acceptance of underground comix in the 1970s, Eisner saw a potential market for his ideas. In 1978, he produced his first book-length, adult-oriented work, \"A Contract with God\". He marketed it as a \"graphic novel\"—a term which had been in use since the 1960s, but was little known until Eisner popularized it with \"Contract\". Though it was a modest commercial success, Eisner was financially independent, and soon set to work on another graphic novel \"Life on Another Planet\", and completed eighteen further graphic novels before his 2005 death; two featured the autobiographical Willie from the story \"Cookalein\": \"The Dreamer\" (1986) and \"To the Heart of the Storm\" (1991).\n\nEisner was brought up in a religious household, but himself was a reluctant disbeliever. In 1970, his sixteen-year-old daughter Alice died after an eighteen-month battle with leukemia. Eisner was enraged, and questioned how a God could let such a thing happen; he dealt with his grief by immersing himself in his work. When working on \"A Contract with God\", he tried to capture these emotions by acting out Frimme Hersh's character in his head.\n\nThe narration is lettered as part of the artwork, rather than being set apart in caption boxes, and Eisner makes little use of conventional box-style panels, often avoiding panel borders entirely, delimiting spaces with buildings or window frames instead. Pages are uncrowded and have large drawings which focus on facial expression. He allowed the length of the stories to develop based on their content, rather than a set page count as was traditional in comics before that time. Eisner emphasizes the urban setting with dramatic, vertical perspective, and dark artwork with much chiaroscuro, and uses visual motifs to tie the stories together. The dark, vertical rain surrounding Hersh when he buries his daughter in the first story is echoed by the revised final image of the last story, in which Willie stares out into a city sky in a similar hatched rainy \"Eisenshpritz\" style. The monochromatic artwork was printed in sepia tones, rather than conventional black-and-white.\n\nIn contrast to comics in the superhero genre, in which Eisner did prominent work early in his career, the characters in \"A Contract with God\" are not heroic; they often feel frustrated and powerless, even when performing seemingly heroic deeds to help their neighbors. The characters are rendered in a caricatured manner that contrasts with the realistic backgrounds, though the backgrounds are rendered in less detail than in Eisner's work in \"The Spirit\"; according to writer Dennis O'Neil, this style mimics the impressionistic sense of memory. Eisner explored these sorts of characters and situations further in his other Dropsie Avenue books, such as \"A Life Force\".\n\nThe stories share themes of disillusionment and frustration over thwarted desires. Frimme Hersh grieves over the death of his daughter, which he perceives as a breach of his contract with God; street singer Eddie returns to insignificance when he finds himself unable to find his would-be benefactor; Goldie's and Willie's romantic ideals are disillusioned after her near-rape and his seduction. Violence also ties the stories together; Eddie's wife-beating is mirrored by the beating Willie's seductress receives from her husband.\n\nThe characters are depicted neither as purely good or evil: for example, Rosie in \"The Super\" triumphs over the racist, abusive superintendent by stealing his money, having him framed for pedophilia, and driving him to suicide. Confinement is a prominent theme; Eisner chooses perspectives through which the reader views the characters framed by doorways, window frames, or sheets of rain. Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism; there is a feeling of elation for characters in the final story as they find their way out of the tenement's, and the city's, confinement.\n\nAccording to academic Derek Royal, Jewish ethnicity is prominent throughout the stories; in \"A Contract with God\" and \"Cookalein\", religious and cultural Jewish symbolry are prominent, though in the middle two stories, there is little outward evidence of the characters' Jewishness. The two outer stories further emphasize Jewish identity with the extra-urban portions of their settings—the rural Russian origin of the religious Hersh in \"Contract\", and the Catskill mountains in \"Cookalein\", a retreat commonly associated with Jews in the 20th century. Eisner deals with representing Jewish identity through community. He juxtaposes individual stories and individual characters, who have different experiences which may be incompatible with one another; this confounds any single definition of \"Jewishness\", though there is a communal sense that binds these characters and their Jewishness together. Royal argues that Eisner shows the unresolved nature of American identity, in which ethnicities are conflicted between cultural assimilation and their ethnic associations. As the book progresses, the characters move from overt Jewishness to greater levels of assimilation, presented as an ambivalent change that has costs of its own.\n\nRoyal argued that the book was not only important to comics studies, but also to the study of Jewish and ethnic American literature. Much like short story cycles common to contemporary Jewish prose, in which stories can stand alone, but complement each other when read as a loosely integrated package, Royal wrote that \"Contract\" could be better described as a \"graphic cycle\" rather than a \"graphic novel\". He wrote that such cycles, as well as Eisner's, emphasized a heterogeneous multiplicity of perspectives, as \"o American ethnic literature can ever be defined monolithically\".\n\nArt critic Peter Schjeldahl saw the \"over-the-topness\" endemic to American comics, and Eisner's work, as \"ill suited to serious subjects, especially those that incorporate authentic social history\". The work has been criticized for its use of stereotypical imagery; writer Jeremy Dauber countered that these images reflect Eisner's own memories of his youth and the strictures that Jewish people felt in the tenements. Others said caricaturized character designs conflicted with the otherwise realism of the stories; the appropriateness of the style was defended by others, such as Dennis O'Neil, who said that they better reflect the impressionistic way a child remembers the past.\n\nThe concept of a contract or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. The idea that God must uphold his end of the first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play \"The Trial of God\" (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?\" Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. She wrote that \"the suffering of the righteous\" is \"one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought\", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.\n\nThe book took two years to finish. Eisner worked through a variety of approaches and styles, and toyed with using color, overlays, or washes, before settling on a hard-lined style printed in sepia. As he had no deadline, he reworked and resequenced the stories until he was satisfied.\n\nEisner intended \"A Contract with God\" to have an adult audience, and wanted it to be sold in bookstores rather than comic shops; as such, he turned down an offer from Denis Kitchen to publish it. Though he had contacts at Bantam Books, he knew they would be uninterested in publishing comics. To secure a meeting with editor Oscar Dystel there, he called the book a \"graphic novel\". When Dystel discovered that the book was actually comics, he told Eisner Bantam would not publish it, but a smaller publisher might.\n\nBaronet Press, a small New York publishing house, agreed to publish \"A Contract with God\", which bears the credit \"Produced by Poorhouse Press\" of \"White Plains, N.Y.\" on its indicia page. Eisner had originally intended to call the book \"Tenement Stories\", \"Tales from the Bronx\", or \"A Tenement in the Bronx\" but Baronet titled it \"A Contract with God\", after the lead story, as the term \"tenement\" was not widely known outside the eastern US. The trade paperback carried the term \"graphic novel\", though it is a collection of stories rather than a novel. As Baronet was not financially sound, Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published.\nSales were initially poor, but demand increased over the years. Kitchen Sink Press reissued the book in 1985, as did DC Comics in 2001 as part of its Will Eisner Library; and W. W. Norton collected it in 2005 as \"The Contract with God Trilogy\" in a single volume with its sequels, \"A Life Force\" (1988) and \"Dropsie Avenue\" (1995). The Norton edition, and subsequent stand-alone editions of \"Contract\", included extra final pages to the stories. , at least eleven translations have been published, including in Yiddish (Lambiek, 1984), a language which would have been common with many of the characters in the book.\n\nDark Horse Books published \"Will Eisner’s A Contract with God Curator’s Collection\" in 2018. This two-volume edition reprints the entire graphic novel at 1:1 size from the original pencil art in one volume and from the original ink art in the second volume. It was nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2019, with editor/designer John Lind winning one award for “Best Presentation.”\n\n\n\"A Contract with God\" has frequently, though erroneously, been cited as the first graphic novel; comic book reviewer Richard Kyle had used the term in 1964 in a fan newsletter, and it had appeared on the cover of \"The First Kingdom\" (1974) by Jack Katz, with whom Eisner had corresponded. A number of book-length comics preceded \"Contract\", at least as far back as Milt Gross's \"He Done Her Wrong\" (1930). \"A Contract with God\" attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner's greater status in the comics community. It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format, but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic-book genre tropes.\n\nEisner continued to produce graphic novels in a third phase to his cartooning career that ultimately lasted longer than either his periods in comic books or in educational comics. According to comics historian R. Fiore, Eisner's work as a graphic novelist also maintained his reputation as \"a contemporary figure rather than a relic of the dim past\".\n\nEditor N. C. Christopher Couch considered the book's physical format to be Eisner's major contribution to the graphic novel form—few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking, whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals. The book succeeded in getting into bookstores, though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it. It was put on display at the Brentano's bookstore in Manhattan, and reportedly sold well. Eisner visited the store to find out how the book was faring after being taking down from display. The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section, and then in humor, but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections. The manager gave up and put the book in storage in the cellar.\n\nEarly reviews were positive. The book's marketing consisted initially of word-of-mouth and in fanzines and trade periodicals, as mainstream newspapers and magazines did not normally review comics at the time. Comic book writer Dennis O'Neil called \"Contract\" \"a masterpiece\" that exceeded his expectations. O'Neil wrote that the combination of words and images mimicked the experience of remembering more accurately than was possible with pure prose. O'Neil's review originally appeared in \"The Comics Journal\", and was used to preface later editions of Eisner's book. Critic Dale Luciano called the book a \"perfectly and exquisitely balanced ... masterpiece\", and praised Kitchen Sink Press for reprinting such a \"risky project\" in 1985.\n\nEisner's status as a cartoonist grew after \"A Contract with God\" appeared, and his influence was augmented by his time as a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York, where he expounded his theories of the medium. He later turned his lectures into the books \"Comics and Sequential Art\" (1985)—the first book in English on the formalities and of the comics medium—and \"Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative\" (1995). As Eisner's social esteem grew, a distinction developed among publishers between Eisner's pre– and post-graphic novel work; highbrow publishers such as W. W. Norton have reissued his graphic novel work, while his superhero \"Spirit\" work has been reprinted by publishers with less social esteem such as DC Comics. \"The Comics Journal\" placed the book in 57th place on its \"Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century\" list, which called it \"the masterpiece of one of the medium's first true artists\".\n\nCartoonist Dave Sim praised the book and wrote that he reread it frequently, but called it \"a bit illegitimate\" to use the term \"graphic novel\" for works of such brevity; he stated he could read the book in \"twenty to thirty minutes\", which he argued amounted to \"the equivalent of a twenty-page short story\".\n\nOn July 24, 2010, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, producers Darren Dean, Tommy Oliver, Bob Schreck, Mike Ruggerio, and Mark Rabinowitz announced plans for a film adaptation of \"A Contract with God\" from a script by Darren Dean, with a different director for each of the four stories.\n\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the University of Toledo Rockets. It is located on the school's Bancroft campus, just south of the banks of the Ottawa River. Known for its blend of old and new, it retains the traditional stonework around the field throughout all its expansions.\n\nOriginally known as University Stadium, it was completed in 1937 at a cost of only $313,558 as a Works Progress Administration project. Originally the natural seating bowl held 8,000 in two sideline grandstands. There was a grass hill at the south end of the stadium, and at the open (north) end of the bowl were two stone towers (still standing), that served as makeshift housing for the football team in its early years. Following World War II, the stadium was renovated, with many glass elements. Because of this, and the city's concentration on the industry, the stadium was renamed the Glass Bowl in 1946. South end zone stands were added in 1966, and further expansion came following Toledo's 35-game win streak from 1969 to 1971, bringing capacity up to 18,500.\n\nIn 1999, the Toledo-based Ohio Cannon of the Regional Football League played at various stadiums, including the Glass Bowl, but did not finish the season.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2001 MAC Championship Game.\n\nIn 1990, the stadium had its largest expansion take place, adding a second level of seats to both sidelines. As part of the $18.5 million renovations, a three-story press box, 45 luxury suites, a 400-seat Stadium Club, sports information offices, and the Larimer Athletic Complex were built. The three-story press box, the second largest in the nation, was the greatest improvement in terms of upgrades, as the former press box was barely long and could only hold approximately 50 people.\n\nFurther improvements include a video scoreboard in the north end zone in 1999, and the upgrade to a Field Turf playing surface in 2008. A new video board was installed in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, a $3.5 million renovation took place, including replacement of the field turf, changes to the facade, updating concessions, restrooms, locker rooms, and ticket booths, as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the stadium.\n\nThe largest crowd in Glass Bowl history for a University of Toledo football game was 36,852 for a game against the United States Naval Academy on October 27, 2001.\n\n\nIn 1961, the University of Toledo procured a genuine rocket from the U.S. Army missile program. The one-ton rocket, which sits outside the Glass Bowl — aimed to hit the 50-yard line of arch-rival Bowling Green's Doyt Perry Stadium — carries two sets of fins and a propellant booster capable of guiding the missile to supersonic velocity.

In addition, the Glass Bowl is used for monster truck rallies, commencements, and concerts, among other uses.\n\n\n\n"}

The music was composed by Arkady Ostrovsky and the lyrics written by Lev Oshanin. Korney Chukovsky, a writer and immensely popular children's poet, later wrote that the inspiration for the song had been the four lines of the refrain, which were composed in 1928 by the four-year-old boy Kostya Barannikov.\n\nThe song was first performed in the \"Good Morning!\" () radio show in July 1962 by Maya Kristalinskaya. Performed in 1963 at the Sopot International Song Festival by Tamara Miansarova, the song earned her first prize there and immediately became popular throughout the USSR and in other countries too. It was frequently sung by Young Pioneers at their camps and school meetings, as well as by Little Octobrists in primary schools, and even by pre-school children. The song was widely regarded in the Soviet Union as expressing the people's desire for peace.\n\nThe song expresses the yearning for lasting peace by millions of people, young and old. In war, the lyrics say, there are no winners. For our sake, and especially for our children's sake, we must achieve peace and remove the dark clouds that now cover the sun.\n\nThe song was translated into English by Tom Botting. The song (or at least its chorus) has been sung in English by Pete Seeger, and is featured on the live album \"Together in Concert\" recorded in 1975 with Arlo Guthrie.\n\nThe song was translated into German by Ilse and Hans Naumilkat and Manfred Streubel (as \"Immer lebe die Sonne\") and was popular among Ernst Thälmann Pioneers.\n\nThe song was also very popular among Finnish Pioneers as \"Paistaa aurinko aina\".\n\nHebrew lyrics were written for the song by composer Gidi Koren. It was recorded (Hebrew title: אלוהים שמור על אמא) and made popular by his Israeli folk group, The Brothers and the Sisters.\n\nThe tune was used for the song \"Gabrielle\" by the Hootenanny Singers, led by Björn Ulvaeus. When this version became a hit song in 1964, the lyrics were translated and performed by the group in Swedish, German, Finnish, Italian, Dutch, and English.\n\nRaffi sang the original chorus and translations into English, Spanish and French on his album \"Let's Play\". There is also an instrumental outro of the other song's title after this song.\n\nThis song was included in a medley during the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\n"}
{"id": "1901903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901903", "title": "Trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry", "text": "Trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry\n\nIn chemistry, a trigonal bipyramid formation is a molecular geometry with one atom at the center and 5 more atoms at the corners of a triangular bipyramid. This is one geometry for which the bond angles surrounding the central atom are not identical (see also pentagonal bipyramid), because there is no geometrical arrangement with five terminal atoms in equivalent positions. Examples of this molecular geometry are phosphorus pentafluoride (PF), and phosphorus pentachloride (PCl) in the gas phase.\n\nThe five atoms bonded to the central atom are not all equivalent, and two different types of position are defined. For phosphorus pentachloride as an example, the phosphorus atom shares a plane with three chlorine atoms at 120° angles to each other in \"equatorial\" positions, and two more chlorine atoms above and below the plane (\"axial\" or \"apical\" positions).\n\nAccording to the VSEPR theory of molecular geometry, an axial position is more crowded because an axial atom has three neighboring equatorial atoms (on the same central atom) at a 90° bond angle, whereas an equatorial atom has only two neighboring axial atoms at a 90° bond angle. For molecules with five identical ligands, the axial bond lengths tend to be longer because the ligand atom cannot approach the central atom as closely. As examples, in PF the axial P−F bond length is 158 pm and the equatorial is 152 pm, and in PCl the axial and equatorial are 214 and 202 pm respectively.\n\nIn the mixed halide PFCl the chlorines occupy two of the equatorial positions, indicating that fluorine has a greater apicophilicity or tendency to occupy an axial position. In general ligand apicophilicity increases with electronegativity and also with pi-electron withdrawing ability, as in the sequence Cl < F < CN. Both factors decrease electron density in the bonding region near the central atom so that crowding in the axial position is less important.\n\nThe VSEPR theory also predicts that substitution of a ligand at a central atom by a lone pair of valence electrons leaves the general form of the electron arrangement unchanged with the lone pair now occupying one position. For molecules with five pairs of valence electrons including both bonding pairs and lone pairs, the electron pairs are still arranged in a trigonal bipyramid but one or more equatorial positions is not attached to a ligand atom so that the molecular geometry (for the nuclei only) is different.\n\nThe seesaw molecular geometry is found in sulfur tetrafluoride (SF) with a central sulfur atom surrounded by four fluorine atoms occupying two axial and two equatorial positions, as well as one equatorial lone pair, corresponding to an AXE molecule in the AXE notation. A T-shaped molecular geometry is found in chlorine trifluoride (ClF), an AXE molecule with fluorine atoms in two axial and one equatorial position, as well as two equatorial lone pairs. Finally, the triiodide ion () is also based upon a trigonal bipyramid, but the actual molecular geometry is linear with terminal iodine atoms in the two axial positions only and the three equatorial positions occupied by lone pairs of electrons (AXE); another example of this geometry is provided by xenon difluoride, XeF.\n\nIsomers with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry are able to interconvert through a process known as Berry pseudorotation. Pseudorotation is similar in concept to the movement of a conformational diastereomer, though no full revolutions are completed. In the process of pseudorotation, two equatorial ligands (both of which have a shorter bond length than the third) \"shift\" toward the molecule's axis, while the axial ligands simultaneously \"shift\" toward the equator, creating a constant cyclical movement. Pseudorotation is particularly notable in simple molecules such as phosphorus pentafluoride (PF).\n\n\n"}

It was the home field of the Colorado State Rams of the Mountain West Conference from 1968 through 2016; the team moved in 2017 to the new on-campus Colorado State Stadium, now known as Canvas Stadium.\n\nThe playing field had a mostly conventional north-south alignment, skewed slightly northwest-southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level. It was natural grass for the stadium's first 38 years; FieldTurf was installed in the summer of 2006 for the final eleven seasons.\nOwned and operated by Colorado State University, it stood on a site located about west of the school's main campus. The stadium opened in 1968 as the replacement for the old Colorado Field, a 14,000-seat on-campus stadium that is now the site of \"Jack Christiansen Track.\"\n\nHughes Stadium sat in a natural oval bowl, with seating on three sides and an open grass berm (not open for seating) behind the south end zone. The west (home side) stands were expanded out of the bowl and capped by a press box. The stadium was named for Harry W. Hughes, the head coach for 31 seasons (1911–41) at what was then known as Colorado Agricultural. The stadium had a seating capacity of 32,500 with club seats and 12 luxury suites, completed in 2005.\n\nThe playing surface itself was named in 2003 in honor of then head coach Sonny Lubick. The winningest coach in school history, he led the Rams for fifteen seasons (1993-2007), winning six conference titles with nine bowl game appearances. \n\nThe first game at Hughes Stadium was played on September 28, 1968, a 17–12 loss to North Texas State, led by Mean Joe Greene. From October 1989 to August 1991, the Rams won eight consecutive games at the stadium, a school record. After 49 seasons, its finale in 2016 saw the Rams defeat New Mexico 49–31 on November 19.\n\nBob Dylan recorded the NBC television special and live concert album \"Hard Rain\" at Hughes Stadium during a rainstorm \n\nAt the time of its closure, future plans for Hughes Stadium were unknown, but it was unlikely to be left dormant, given away, or developed for high-density use. CSU eventually decided to demolish the stadium and restore the site to its original bowl-shaped topography before selling the site for future development. Pre-demolition work began in March 2018 with hazardous material mitigation (mainly asbestos), with full-scale demolition beginning on April 10. Demolition continued into summer 2018, followed by filling in the stadium bowl with soil that had been originally used to create berms around the stadium. The project was expected to be completed in December 2018.\n\nAttendance information for primary tenant, Colorado State Rams.\n"}

While at the university, he entered a student competition and designed, (with Frank Miles Day and William C. Hays), the 1894 student union, Houston Hall. Credit for this design, however, was given to a faculty member, Frank Miles Day with Medary listed as an associate architect.\n\nMedary remained with Frank Miles Day until 1894, when he founded his own firm in Philadelphia, Field & Medary. That firm would become Zantzinger, Borie & Medary in 1910. He was employed in 1904 to rehabilitate Solitude Farm in West Whiteland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Medary began design work in 1908 on the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Its exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921, under Zantzinger, Borie & Medary. He designed the Fiske Portal (1922–23), a new doorway for St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia. Sculptor and cabinetmaker Edward Maene, metalworker Samuel Yellin, and stained glass designer Nicola D'Ascenzo collaborated on the doors and the polychromed \"Christ in Majesty\" tableau above them. His firm designed the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company Building (1926–28) in Philadelphia (now an annex of the Philadelphia Museum of Art), and the Bok Singing Tower (1927–29), in Lake Wales, Florida.\n\nMedary was a design consultant to several universities, the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association, and Mount Vernon. His buildings include the Pennsylvania Athletic Club, Bryn Mawr Hospital, and, with Paul Cret, the Detroit Institute of Arts. Medary served as chairman of the Department of Labor's Housing Corporation during World War I and was selected in 1927 by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon to serve on the Board of Architectural Consultants, which advised the department on the design of the Federal Triangle development. Medary served on the National Capital Park and Planning Commission and on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C.; he was president of both the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and its Philadelphia chapter, a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and was affiliated with the Foundation for Architecture and Landscape Architecture and with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Medary was honored by the AIA with a gold medal in 1929 and by the Philadelphia Art Club with a gold medal in 1927, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania in 1927.\n\nHe died in 1929.\n\n"}

The stadium was named after the old nickname of the school, the Indians, until the 2007 season when it was renamed ASU Stadium. The venue was again renamed in September 2012 after Liberty Bank donated approximately $5 million to the university, and was renamed in 2013 after Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank. The stadium currently has a capacity of 30,406.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1974 however construction was not completely finished until prior to the 1975 season. Not all bleachers had been installed by the start of the 1974 season and lights were not installed until after the season. Despite not being fully completed, the Arkansas State football team began play there in 1974. The original cost of the stadium was $2.5 million of which $1.4 million was raised by friends and alumni of the university. The first game played in the stadium was on September 28, 1974 against Louisiana Tech University and Arkansas State lost 21–7. The first victory in the stadium was a 14–7 win over Eastern Michigan University on October 5, 1974. A dedication game was played on November 2, 1974 against Northeast Louisiana University and Arkansas State won the game 17–14.\n\nThe stadium originally had a capacity of 16,343 when it first opened. This was upgraded in 1980 to a capacity of 18,709. Further expansion was completed in 1991, when Arkansas State moved up from Division I-AA (FCS) to Division I-A (FBS) and new capacity requirements had to be met to keep up with this status, making the capacity 30,708. The grandstand was double-decked with seats and Indian Stadium had a four level press area that includes the press box and two donor levels: Happy Hunting Grounds and Chiefs Council. The area also includes a photo deck complete with an area for filming, Visiting Team AD Suite and coaches booths for both teams. In 2001, a video/scoreboard was erected in the South end zone which cost more than a million dollars to purchase and construct.\n\nIn 2013, Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank, and the naming rights were also absorbed. Liberty Bank Stadium was renamed Centennial Bank Stadium for the 2014 football season.\n\nIn 2002, more improvements were added to the stadium. Luxury suites were added, increasing capacity to its current figure of 30,964. The players and coaches of the school moved into a brand new complex that included office space for coaches, dressing rooms, meeting rooms, and player lounges. When these areas are not being used by staff and players they are used for several different purposes. These areas become suites used during football games, academic study areas for players and students, conference rooms, alumni functions, booster meetings, and recruitment purposes. The complex now houses a place known as the Performance Enhancement Center. Inside this center there are several different areas that include the Athletic Training Center, Strength and Conditioning Center, Student-Athletic Academic Success Center, a computer lab, and other various offices and rooms. In 2005, it was announced that Arkansas State University would replace the natural Bermuda grass field with FieldTurf at a cost of $500,000. However, Pro Green synthetic grass was installed in the stadium prior to the start of the 2006 season.\n\nThanks to a $5 million gift – the largest individual donation in A-State Athletics history – by alumnus Johnny Allison, a “Centennial Expansion” construction and renovation project to the stadium’s press box and west-side concourse took place during the nine-month period between the 2014 and 2015 seasons.\n\nThe entire project, including the press box and concourse, covered . The Centennial Expansion project included a complete overhaul to the stadium press box, expanding it from . The project also included improvements and additions to the concourse bathrooms, concessions, gating and ticketing areas.\n\nIn 2013, Arkansas State University announced plans to build a $27 million Football Operations Center with an indoor practice field, weight rooms, lockers, medical centers, and staff offices. The plans originally called for the north end zone seating to be removed, but with average attendance being higher than ever, new seating with concession stands and TV screens are to be added.\n\nIn 2014, a Daktronics LED video display/scoreboard measuring approximately high by wide was erected in the south end zone. This replaces the scoreboard erected in 2001.\n\nCentennial Bank Stadium features a multi-level press box, which houses media areas, coaching booths, broadcasting locations, a video control booth, camera areas, suites, a club area and more. The face of the stadium has been redesigned to include 42 loge boxes, 20 suites, a club area covering close to and 344 club seats in its revenue-generating areas. Not only has depth been added to the press box, it now spans from approximately the 15-to-15 yard lines, allowing for enhanced media, coaching, broadcasting, control booth, visiting athletics director suite, and camera areas.\n\nThe stadium was also used for a very brief period to showcase a game between the two largest high schools in the Jonesboro-area. The game pitted Jonesboro High School against cross-town rival Nettleton High School. The game was suspended temporarily after Jonesboro won the first two games in blowouts. The average stadium attendance for these games were over 7,000. The rivalry was renewed for the 2006 high school football season and the two schools again played the game in Indian Stadium. Jonesboro won the 2006 game, but it was closer than the previous games; the final score was 44–38. In 2010 a new rivalry started with the Greene County Tech Golden Eagles. This rivalry was known as the \"Border Bowl\" as the counties in which the schools are located (Craighead and Greene) border each other. The series was discontinued as Jonesboro swept the series 4–0. In 2014, a new rivalry was formed with cross-town rival Valley View High School.\n\nThe largest crowd to see an Arkansas State football game in Centennial Bank Stadium was 31,243 on December 1, 2012, when the Red Wolves hosted Middle Tennessee State University. The highest average attendance in the stadium's history was during the 2012 season when Arkansas State drew an average of 26,398 spectators per game.\n\n"}

During a career that spanned more than 60 years, he performed not only in feature films but also in scores of television series, as well as appearing on various country music programs and talk shows. Television audiences, however, perhaps most closely associate Best with his role as the bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane in the action-comedy series \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", which originally aired on CBS between 1979 and 1985. He reprised the role in 1997 and 2000 for the made-for-television movies \"\" and \"\" (2000).\n\nBest was born on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, to Lark and Lena Guy. His mother was the sister of Ike Everly, the father of the pop duo The Everly Brothers. After his mother died of tuberculosis in 1929, then three-year-old James was sent to live in an orphanage. He was later adopted by Armen Best (1897–1984) and his wife, Essa Myrtle ( Knowland; 1896–1988) and went to live with them in Corydon, Indiana.\n\nBest served in the United States Army in World War II, training in 1944 in Biloxi, Mississippi, as a gunner on a B-17 bomber; but by the time he completed his training the war had almost ended, so he was assigned to the army's law enforcement section. In the military police, as an \"MP\", Best served in war-torn Germany immediately after the Nazi government's surrender in May 1945. While stationed in Germany, Best soon transferred from the military police to an army unit of actors, who traveled around Europe performing plays for troops. Those experiences formed the beginning of his acting career.\n\nBest began his contract career in 1949 at Universal Studios, where he met fellow actors Julie Adams, Piper Laurie, Tony Curtis, and Rock Hudson. Initially, he performed in several uncredited roles for Universal, such as in the 1950 film \"One Way Street\", but credited performances soon followed that same year in the Westerns \"Comanche Territory\", \"Winchester '73\", and \"Kansas Raiders\". Work in that genre continued to be an important part of his ongoing film career, including roles in \"The Cimarron Kid\" (1952), \"Seven Angry Men\" (1955) in which he portrays one of the sons of abolitionist John Brown, \"Last of the Badmen\" (1957), \"Cole Younger Gunfighter\" (1958), \"Ride Lonesome\" (1959), \"The Quick Gun\" (1964), and \"Firecreek\" (1968). Yet Best's film roles are not limited to Westerns. He also stars in the 1959 science fiction cult movie \"The Killer Shrews\" and in its 2012 sequel \"Return of the Killer Shrews\", as Rhidges in the 1958 film adaptation of Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead\", as Carter in the James Stewart classic \"Shenandoah\", as Dr. Ben Mizer in the 1966 comedy \"Three on a Couch\", and as the cross-dressing Dewey Barksdale in the 1976 drama \"Ode to Billy Joe\".\n\nBest guest-starred more than 280 times in various television series. In 1954, he played the outlaw Dave Ridley, opposite Gloria Winters as the female bandit \"Little Britches\" in an episode of \"Stories of the Century\". In 1954, Best appeared twice on the syndicated \"Annie Oakley\" series, starring Gail Davis and Brad Johnson. In 1955, he played Jim Blake on \"The Lone Ranger\", Season 4, Episode 47, along with Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels. He was cast in the religion anthology series \"Crossroads\", in its 1956 episode \"The White Carnation.\" He was also cast on an episode of Jackie Cooper's early NBC sitcom \"The People's Choice\" and in the David Janssen crime drama \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\".\nBest made four appearances on the syndicated anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\". His first role was as miner \"Tiny\" Stoker in the 1955 episode, \"Million Dollar Wedding\". In the story line, Stoker, in a bet with two of his cohorts, proposes marriage to a presumably plain woman in their community, Aggie Filene (played by Virginia Lee, an actress who lived from 1924 to 2008). Soon, though, the couple falls madly in love with each other and go on a world-wide honeymoon tour with proceeds from a gold strike that they had nearly forfeited. And Aggie returns to the mining camp as a beautiful woman.\n\nIn 1960, Best appeared in the episode \"Love on Credit\" of CBS's anthology series, \"The DuPont Show with June Allyson\". The same year, he guest-starred on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" as \"The Guitar Player\" (Season 1, Episode 3 and 31). He starred in three episodes of \"The Twilight Zone\" including \"The Grave\" (Season 3, Episode 7), \"The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank,\" (Season 3, Episode 23) and \"Jess-Belle\" (Season 4, Episode 7). In 1963, he was cast as the courageous Wisconsin game warden, Ernie Swift, in the episode \"Open Season\" of another CBS anthology series, \"GE True\", hosted by Jack Webb. In the storyline, Swift faces the reprisal of organized crime after he tickets gangster Frank MacErlane (David McLean) for illegal fishing.\n\nIn 1962, he played the part of Art Fuller in the episode \"Incident of El Toro\" on CBS's \"Rawhide\"; and in 1963, he returned to play Willie Cain in the episode \"Incident at Spider Rock.\" Best made two guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\". In 1963 he played title character Martin Potter in \"The Case of the Surplus Suitor,\" and in 1966 he played defendant and oilman Allan Winford in \"The Case of the Unwelcome Well.\" He appeared on a long list of other television series in the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Wagon Train\" (three times), \"Laramie\" (three times), \"The Adventures of Kit Carson\" (twice as Henry Jordan), the western anthology series \"Frontier\" (twice), \"The Rebel\", \"Bonanza\", \"Sheriff of Cochise\", \"Pony Express\", \"Rescue 8\", \"The Texan\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Have Gun – Will Travel\", \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\", \"Tombstone Territory\", \"Whispering Smith\", \"Trackdown\", \"The Rifleman\", \"Cheyenne\", \"Stagecoach West\",\" \",\" Overland Trail\",\" Bat Masterson\",\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Combat!\", \"The Green Hornet \"(\"Deadline For Death\"),\" The Mod Squad\",\" I Spy\", and \"The Fugitive\".\n\nBest played Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on CBS's \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" from the debut of the program in 1979 until the end of the series in 1985. That role was Best's most visible success. He later revealed that the caricature-like persona of Sheriff Coltrane was developed from a voice he used when playing with his young children. On set, Best was particularly close to Sorrell Booke, who played the character of Boss Hogg, who was both the boss and the brother-in-law of Rosco. The two actors became close friends; and according to interviews by the series' creators, the two often improvised their scenes together, making up their own dialogue as they went along. Until his death, he also remained close to Catherine Bach, who played the character of Daisy Duke; and long after the show's cancellation, she was a regular visitor to the website dedicated to Best's painting.\n\nIn 1991, in contrast to the comical Rosco Coltrane of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", Best appeared in an episode of the NBC crime drama \"In the Heat of the Night\". He won a Florida Crystal Reel Award for Best Actor, for his portrayal of Nathan Bedford in the episode \"Sweet, Sweet Blues,\" playing a retired sheriff and repentant killer.\n\nIn August 2008, Best was presented the Florida Motion Picture and Television Association’s Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBest later moved to Florida and taught at the University of Central Florida (Orlando). After semi-retiring, he administered a production company and accepted occasional acting roles. He also developed a reputation as an artist for his paintings of landscapes, scenes from \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", and other subjects. Later, after residing for a while on Lake Murray near Columbia, South Carolina, he moved once again, this time to Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nAn acting coach too, Best taught drama and acting techniques for more than 25 years in Los Angeles. He also served as artist-in-residence and taught drama at the University of Mississippi (Oxford) for two years prior to his stint on \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\n\nIn 2009, he completed his autobiography \"Best In Hollywood: The Good, The Bad and The Beautiful\". The book, published in 2009 through BearManor Media, premiered at the Mid Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Aberdeen, Maryland.\n\nOn November 9, 2014, Best and fellow actor Robert Fuller (along with their wives) attended the 100th birthday celebration of lifelong friend and fellow actor Norman Lloyd. Best said, \"I had the honor to have been directed by Norman in a Hitchcock episode called \"The Jar.\" Having worked with hundreds of directors in my career, I found very few that had Norman's qualities. He was most kind, gracious and patient with his actors. He is in all respects a complete gentleman in his personal life and I found it a genuine pleasure just to be in the presence of such a talented man. I am also doubly honored to consider him my friend. We are so blessed to have such a man among us for so long.\"\n\nBest had a son, Gary, with his first wife. In 1959, Best married his second wife, Jobee Ayers. The couple had two daughters, Janeen and Jojami, before divorcing in 1977. Janeen is an actress, screenwriter and producer, first as Janeen Best then as Janeen Damian, after her 1998 marriage to actor and producer Michael Damian. Best married his third wife, Dorothy Collier, in 1986. He had 3 grandchildren.\n\nHe enjoyed a wide range of hobbies and interests. He was an accomplished painter, a guitarist, a black belt in karate, enjoyed writing, and ran his own acting school. His students included Lindsay Wagner, Roger Miller, Glen Campbell, Quentin Tarantino, and Regis Philbin. He was also an animal rights advocate.\n\nBest died on April 6, 2015, in Hickory, North Carolina, from complications of pneumonia at the age of 88.\n\nPrior to his death, Best's former \"Dukes of Hazzard\" co-star and long-time friend, John Schneider, said; \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year.\" He also added that, when asked to cry for the camera, \"(Best) would say, 'sure thing, which eye?' I'm forever thankful to have cut my teeth in the company of such a fine man.\" Nearly one year after Best's death, Schneider said about his working relationship with Best: \"He was amazing in everything he did; he was not just a funny guy. In fact, I think the comedic timing came to him later on in life because before that he was a very serious actor. I was very fortunate to have grown up working with people like Jimmie Best and Denver Pyle and Sorrell Booke. Incredibly talented men, incredibly talented actors.\"\n\nBest, James; Clark, Jim (2009). \"Best in Hollywood: The Good, The Bad, And The Beautiful.\" Albany, New York: BearManor Media, 2009; .\n\n"}

Primarily used for college football, it is the home field of the BYU Cougars, an independent in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Opened as \"Cougar Stadium\" in 1964, its seating capacity is 63,470.\n\nThe natural grass playing field is conventionally aligned north–south at an elevation of above sea level, with the press box along the west sideline.\n\nOn the north end of campus, the stadium opened in 1964 as Cougar Stadium, replacing a much smaller 5,000-seat venue of the same name. The first game on Friday night, October 2, was attended by 33,610, a state record. The original stadium, corresponding to the lower half of the current facility's grandstand seats, had a seating capacity was just over 28,800. Seating was soon added to make room for 35,000, and temporary bleachers in the end zones raised the capacity to 45,000.\n\nThe stadium was expanded in 1982 to accommodate more than 65,000; permanent concrete stands in the end zones, separated by entryways from the east and west grandstands, were put in place of the temporary bleachers. The playing field was lowered , and the running track was removed to make room for six additional rows.\n\nLaVell Edwards (1930–2016) was the head coach at BYU for 29 seasons, preceded by ten years as an assistant. He retired after the 2000 season and the stadium was soon renamed in his honor. During the 2002 Olympics, the stadium's parking lot was used as a park and ride lot for guests attending events at the Peaks Ice Arena and Soldier Hollow. \n\nThe stadium was renovated in 2003 to provide additional luxury seating, which reduced the capacity to 64,045. The luxury seating was a noticeable addition because the arrangement of blue and white seats in this section spells out BYU in block letters. In 2008, BYU unveiled a new video board on the north end zone on August 30, allowing fans seated in the south end zone to see the instant replays and graphics which previously were shown only on the south board. In addition, a brand-new addition to the stadium was the Cougar Marching Band Hall, which included a large rehearsal room, uniform storage space, band offices, instrument lockers, and video screens that assist in rehearsals.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, the stadium's capacity was further reduced due to some renovations that allowed for more wheelchair accessibility. As of 2016, 63,470 is considered a sellout.\n\nThe stadium underwent some upgrades before the 2012 season: new HD LED videoboards face the north and south end zones, replacing the outdated and smaller video screens, and they are flanked by video ribbons that stretch along the top of the north and south stands. The elevator shafts have been freshly coated to reflect the new BYU \"blue\" color scheme, each has the oval Y painted on it, and in 2013 the student section was unified into one area to seat the BYU student section instead of being scattered throughout the stadium.\n\nPrior to the 1982 expansion, it was the home venue for BYU's outdoor track and field teams and hosted the NCAA championships in 1967 and 1975. A new track facility was built just south of the stadium and later named for Clarence F. Robison, the Cougars' legendary track coach.\n\nPart of the largest collection of Jurassic period fossils in North America, housed at BYU, was stored underneath the east bleachers of the stadium until 2005. The fossils have since been prepared and are on display in the BYU Museum of Paleontology's collection room.\n\nDue to installation of new features in the stadium, the grounds crew and BYU Police have installed a number of security features to prevent students from entering the stadium after hours, including infrared security cameras and motion detectors. Anyone found entering the stadium after hours may be charged with trespassing and receive a fine up to $500.\n\n\n"}

It is the university's venue for football and women's soccer for the Nevada Wolf Pack of the Mountain West Conference. It is named after the Mackay family, benefactors of the university by Clarence and John Mackay.\n\nLocated on the northern portion of campus, at 17th Street & East Stadium Way, the stadium opened on October 1, 1966 with a seating capacity of 7,500. It replaced the original Mackay Stadium, formerly located in the bowl containing Hilliard Plaza, the Mack Social Sciences building and the Reynolds School of Journalism. Both stadiums were named for the Mackay family, who were university benefactors in the early years of the school. The stadium currently seats 30,000 and has played to crowds in excess. The field sits at an elevation of above sea level and runs in a NW to SE configuration, with the press box on the southwest sideline. \n\nPermanent lighting was installed in 2003 to allow the option of night games. Originally natural grass, synthetic infill FieldTurf was installed in 2000 and replaced in 2010. In 2013, the playing surface at Mackay Stadium was named Chris Ault Field in honor of the former Wolf Pack head coach, College Football Hall of Famer, creator of the Pistol offense in 2004 and for his contributions to Wolf Pack football.\n\nA proposal passed by the Nevada Board of Regents (NSHE) upgraded seating options to the stadium for the 2016 season. This renovation has improved the quality of the fans' experiences but decreased the overall stadium capacity to 26,000. Higher ticket fees in the upgraded sections will repay this $11.5 million bond by 2031.\n\nThe Wolf Pack football single-season attendance record was set in 1991 with a total of 180,457 fans over nine home games, including playoffs; and the regular-season attendance record was set at 151,081 fans in 1993. The single-season attendance record for a Wolf Pack team with a losing record (at 149,635 fans) was set in 2013. 2014 was the third football season to have at least 20,000 fans in attendance at every home game (1993 and 2013), although multiple seasons were close.\n\nThe Nevada women's soccer team has hosted home crowds with over 1,000 on three occasions. The record was actually set at the Moana Sports Complex in Reno on September 15, 2013, with a record of 1,050 fans in attendance, where the Wolf Pack beat the Sacramento State Hornets, 3–2. Soccer's home-game attendance record at Mackay Stadium is 1,043 fans, as the Wolf Pack beat Wyoming, 1–0, on October 18, 2015. The third-largest Nevada soccer game with over 1,000 fans was also held at Mackay Stadium with 1,007 fans on September 23, 2012, as the Wolf Pack lost 0-3 to #15 California.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for football and is the home field of the ULM Warhawks. The stadium, named for former coach James L. Malone, opened in 1978 and has a seating capacity of 27,617 people. The field is named JPS Field, for a local company, JPS Aviation/JPS Equipment Rental. The field was named after the company after they agreed to fund installation of a new FieldTurf playing surface in 2014.\n\nBecause Northeast Louisiana University's previous stadium could hold just over 8,000 spectators, the late Mayor W. L. \"Jack\" Howard pushed for construction of a new football stadium. Malone Stadium, named after the winningest coach in school history James L. Malone, opened on September 16, 1978, with a capacity of 20,000, with the then-Northeast Louisiana Indians beat Arkansas State, 21–13.\n\nIt is located across Bayou Desiard from the main campus, the center of the school's athletic facilities. The field runs roughly north-northeast, with an imbalanced grandstand, the west stands being the larger stands. The lower west level is a solid enclosed structure, with the ULM Athletic Training Center enclosed, and the upper level extends much higher, with the press box and luxury boxes located on top. The east side is also decked, with a short first deck wrapping around almost from goalpost to goalpost and another short steel-supported upper deck running the length of the field.\n\nBoth sides of seating were extended into each end zone in 1983, increasing the capacity to 23,277. The press box was enlarged in 1991, and capacity decreased to 22,077. In 1993, 8,350 seats were added to the stadium, increasing capacity to its current figure of 30,427.\n\nIn 2007, ULM excavated the natural grass from Malone Stadium to install ProPlay artificial turf.\n\nIn 2011, the university installed a new scoreboard with a HD video display measuring 23 feet high by 48 feet wide (1,104 square feet) and flanked by two low definition video panels for advertisements measuring high by wide. Also, a new sound system was installed in the upper corners of the scoreboard.\n\nA record crowd of 31,175 was reached on September 21, 2012 against the Baylor Bears at the 2012 home opener.\n\nIn 2014, JPS Aviation/JPS Equipment Rental paid $450,000 to replace the artificial turf with new FieldTurf and for the field to be named JPS Field at Malone Stadium for the next eight seasons.\n\nA new field house facility was completed in August 2016 at a cost of $4.1 million. The building is located in the north end zone, attached to the west grandstand. It features a hall of fame area, locker room, coaches’ offices, and patios overlooking the field.\n\nThe largest crowd to see a Warhawk football game in Malone Stadium was 31,175 on September 21, 2012, when the Warhawks hosted Baylor University.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for football and soccer, and is the home field of the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies. It may also host the Connecticut Underground of the Freedom Football League; in the fall of 2010, it was home to the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League. The stadium, which opened in 2003, was the first stadium used primarily by an NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) team to open in the 21st century. The permanent stadium capacity is 40,000, consisting of 38,066 permanent seats with a standing-room area in the scoreboard plaza that can accommodate up to 1,934 people. It also has a game day capability to add approximately 2,000 temporary seats as it did for UConn\nfootball vs. Michigan in 2013. Connecticut played on campus at Memorial Stadium in Storrs, before 2003.\n\nRentschler Field was originally the name of the company airfield for Pratt & Whitney that formerly occupied the site. The airfield, which began operations in 1931, was named after Frederick Rentschler, who founded Pratt & Whitney in 1925 and also founded its parent company, United Technologies. It was originally used for test flights and maintenance operations, and later for corporate aviation. The site was decommissioned as an airport in the 1990s, and donated to the state of Connecticut by United Technologies in 1999. A subsequent 65-acre donation by United Technologies in 2009 allowed for the construction of additional grass parking lots adjacent to the Stadium.\n\nPursuant to a lease agreement with the State, UConn plays all its home football games at Rentschler Field.\n\nThe New England Patriots considered moving to Connecticut and sharing a stadium with the UConn football team in the mid-1990s. The new stadium was supposed to be built on the Connecticut Convention Center site in downtown Hartford. However, when the Patriots completed the deal for Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Hartford stadium plan was scaled down and the location was moved to East Hartford. The current capacity of 40,000 can expand to 50,000 with limited rehabilitation and has the layout and design for expansion of up to 60,000 seats in the future.\n\nThe stadium is owned by the State of Connecticut, Office of Policy and Management, while operations are overseen by the quasi-public Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA). Global Spectrum, L.P. has managed the building on behalf of CRDA since 2013. Previously, the Stadium was managed by Bushnell Management Services (2011-2013), Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)(2007-2011) and Madison Square Garden L.P. (2003-2007).\n\nOn July 16, 2015, it was announced that the stadium had been named Pratt & Whitney Stadium in a deal between Pratt & Whitney and UConn. The playing surface is still named Rentschler Field. In return, Pratt and Whitney donated additional land that will be used for game day parking.\n\nThe UConn Huskies football team has an all time 61–48 record at Rentschler Field.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, it was announced that the renovations at Dillon Stadium would not be completed on time for Hartford Athletic's home opener on May 4 against Charlotte Independence. Hartford Athletic played seven games at Pratt & Whitney Stadium.\n\nOn September 23, 2017, New York City FC played a home match at Pratt & Whitney Stadium, against the Houston Dynamo, in the stadium's first Major League Soccer game. The game was relocated from Yankee Stadium in New York City due to a schedule conflict with the New York Yankees.\n\nRentschler Field has hosted several United States men's national soccer team's home games, including Landon Donovan's last game for the National Team on October 10, 2014.\n\nRentschler Field has also hosted several United States women's national soccer team's home games.\n\nThe Hartford Colonials were a United Football League team that played their home games at Rentschler Field. During their (2010 UFL season), the Colonials played all four home games at Rentschler, after having played one there the previous season while they were known as the New York Sentinels. Attendance at Colonials games averaged a consistent 15,000 people, third place in the five-team league behind Omaha and Sacramento. The UFL suspended the Colonials franchise in 2011 and the franchise was officially terminated when the team's former owner (Bill Mayer) was named as the new owner of the Virginia Destroyers.\n\nOn May 19, 2019, Rentschler Field hosted the Quarterfinals for the 2019 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship.\nIn 2021 and 2022, Rentschler Field will host the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship for Divisions I, II, and III.\n\nRentschler Field hosted its first rugby union match on July 3, 2004, when the USA Rugby union hosted France in front of 6,000 people. France would win 39-31.\nOn June 4, 2005, Rentschler Field hosted two rugby union matches; Wales vs USA Rugby and the 2005 U.S. Rugby Super League Championship game, between New York Athletic Club Rugby Football Club and Belmont Shore RFC in front of 8,027. Wales would defeat the US 77-3 and NYAC would defeat Belmont Shore 23 to 19.\n\nOn August 24, 2010, a fan event, called Whalers Fan Fest, occurred, featuring many of the former players, draws were close to 5,000 people on a Saturday afternoon.\nFrom February 11 to the 20th, 2011, the stadium hosted the Whalers Hockey Fest 2011. A hockey rink was constructed on the field much like is done for the annual NHL Winter Classic. Events included a Hartford Whalers Alumni vs. Boston Bruins Alumni game, with an appearance from the Hanson Brothers, from the film Slap Shot, a double-header featuring both UConn men's and women's hockey teams, a Hockey Legends team faced off against the Mystery, Alaska Hollywood team, along with the Hanson Brothers from the movie Slap Shot, and the second edition of the American Hockey League Outdoor Classic between the host Connecticut Whale and the Providence Bruins. Over 15,000 fans came out to watch the so-called \"Whale Bowl\", while over 1,700 attended the UConn men's game.\n\n\n"}

They are similar in texture and taste, but they are produced with different methods, making Oaxaca cheese slightly drier.\n\nIt is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made. The string cheese process (\"pasta filata\"), originally from Italy, which is used to produce mozzarella, was brought to Mexico by the Dominican friars that settled in Oaxaca. As water buffalo milk was unavailable, they used cow's milk, instead.

The stadium is located on the school's west campus, just south of the Huron River.\n\nThe stadium held its first game on September 27, 1969, when EMU upset the University of Akron, 10–3. It originally consisted of two opposite sideline stands around the field and running track. It is one of only two stadiums in the MAC which shares its football field with a running track (UB Stadium being the other). The stadium was named for the late Elton J. Rynearson, Sr., who coached football at Eastern Michigan for 26 seasons. His teams compiled a record of 114–58–15. In one six-year period, from 1925–30, Rynearson’s teams won 40 games, tied two, and lost just four.\n\nThe largest attendance for an EMU game at Rynearson Stadium was 26,188 (87% of capacity), on November 28, 2008, for a 56–52 win over Central Michigan.\n\nIn 1992, the seats were expanded south from each grandstand but not connected, giving the stadium the look of an unfinished horseshoe. This was done to conform to the new Division I-A rules for minimum stadium size. Originally a grass field, the field has been artificial since 1991 and was upgraded to FieldTurf in 2005. More recently, the original FieldTurf was replaced prior to the 2014 season by a new gray FieldTurf surface. This made Rynearson Stadium only the second Division I FBS stadium with a non-traditional field color (after Albertsons Stadium at Boise State) and the sixth college football stadium overall with this feature. Lighting was added in 1974, partially due to the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League using the stadium as their home field. The stadium has also hosted high school football games.\n\n\n"}

The cost for Waldo Stadium also included the construction of Hyames Field, the school's baseball stadium directly west of the football field. The stadium is named for Dwight B. Waldo, first president of the school.\n\nThe location of Waldo Stadium has been home for Western football since 1914. A field, without a stadium or modern seating, existed through 1938, until the construction and completion of the stadium in 1939. It originally included an eight-lane track, which has since moved to Kanley Track across Stadium Drive. Financing came through private donations, and those who donated were awarded tickets to the inaugural game against Western Kentucky University. Over the years, WMU continued adding seating to the stadium. In 1973 the capacity was increased to 25,000, and AstroTurf replaced the natural grass field. A renovation in 1989 pushed the available seats to 30,200. In 1993 permanent lighting was added, and in 1995 the University added 325 club seats to the press box. In 1998 the Bill Brown Alumni Football Center was completed, which created new offices for staff, suites, and upgraded facilities for the team.\n\nIn 2013, the athletic department made almost $3.5 million in renovations and upgrades to Waldo Stadium and Seelye Center, the football team's indoor practice facility. Included in the upgrades were: new artificial turf for stadium, new brown and gold turf for the indoor practice facility, a revamped and upgraded weight room, a remodeled locker room, renovated meeting rooms, and a new team lounge and showplace. Additional renovations were made to the stadium complex from 2014 to 2015 including new speakers for the stadium, new scoreboards and video boards bringing renovation costs to $5.7 million since 2013. A $2 million donation for the project was made by 1988 WMU alum Alec Gores.\n\nOn October 14, 2017, the Bronco football team was slated to play Akron for homecoming, when rains from a fall storm combined with drainage system failures flooded the field and postponed the game. Also contributing to the flood, Waldo Stadium is considered the lowest point in the city of Kalamazoo. The game was played at 1pm the next day (A possible Sunday first for Waldo Stadium), and the Broncos were defeated by Akron 13-14. It was reported that over 1 million gallons of water were pumped off the field overnight to prepare the field for the Sunday game.\n\nIn 2003, the stadium took on a new look with the completion of the $25 million Donald J. Seelye Center. The Seelye Center rises eight stories and houses an indoor practice field, weight and fitness rooms, and staff offices. It is located on the edge of the northeast endzone, allowing the Seelye club suites to get a view of the game.

Schweizer comments on how odd it is that the deeply suspicious Herod places his absolute trust in the magi. France defends the historicity of this story. He theorizes that Herod decided not to use soldiers as they would alarm the villagers and make it difficult to find the infant. Also any soldiers or others close to Herod would have known very well why they were hunting the infant King of the Jews and may have balked at killing the potential messiah.

It opened on September 4, 1993, with a game against the University of Maine.\n\nThe stadium was built from 1991 to 1993 as the final piece of the school's \"Run to Division I\" drive, meant to bring UB football back to Division I status and as the feature athletics venue for the 1993 Summer Universiade. The program had been dropped for seven years in the 1970s, but returned at a lower level. The team had played at a much smaller, 4,000-seat UB Stadium (now known as Walter Kunz Stadium) from the time of its move to the Town of Amherst north of Buffalo in 1985 until 1992. The current stadium opened in the summer of 1993, hosting the World University Games. The Bulls played their first six years in the stadium as a member of Division I-AA, finally making their return to Division I-A in 1999.\n\nThe stadium consists of a north-south field surrounded by an eight-lane track. There are the original double-decked grandstands on either sideline spanning the entire length of the football field, a large bleacher grandstand around the south end of the track, and two shorter bleacher sections on the north side with the free-standing scoreboard located between them. The stadium is lit by the four large light towers near the corners of the stadium.\n\nThe stadium hosted the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Empire State Games on July 21, 2010. The stadium was the primary venue for the 1995 World Masters Athletics Championships.\n\nThe stadium is located at the east side of UB's North Campus. Students typically walk to the stadium from the Ellicott Complex, Greiner Hall, and the Governors Complex or take the UB Stampede buses directly to Alumni Arena, which is nearby.\n\nUB Stadium has a capacity of approximately 25,000. The sideline seating areas consist of two main grandstands which hold 15,000 (7,500 each). A large bleacher grandstand in the southern end of the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 10,000. There is additional space on the north and south ends of the field level that is utilized as a standing room only space which accommodates approximately 3,000, though this is not factored into the capacity of the stadium.\n\nIn 1999, the school added two rounded bleacher sections to UB stadium, raising the capacity to above 29,000. The southern section holds 10,000. Two half-sections were constructed in the north endzone, both with a capacity of 3,000 each (6,000 total). In October 2017, demolition work commenced on the northern endzones of the stadium in preparation for the program's new , $18 million field house. The demolition of the bleachers brought the stadium's capacity down to about 25,000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1901976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901976", "title": "Dreamstyle Stadium", "text": "Dreamstyle Stadium\n\nDreamstyle Stadium (formerly University Stadium) is an outdoor football stadium located on the south campus of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is the home field of New Mexico Lobos football, which competes as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The stadium opened in September 1960 and currently has a seating capacity of 39,224. The playing surface, named Turner & Margaret Branch Field, is oriented in the north-south configuration that is traditional for football venues. The stadium sits nearly a mile above sea level, at an elevation of 5,100 feet (1554 m).\n\nBefore 1960, Lobos football teams played home games at Zimmerman Field, a 16,000-seat stadium which was located just south of the current Zimmerman Library on the university’s main campus. The growth of the university after World War II, with the concomitant growth in the popularity of varsity athletics, made it clear by the mid-1950s that a new, larger football venue was needed. Increasing enrollments also meant that space on the main campus was at a premium. As such, it was decided that a new stadium would be constructed off of the main campus, which would both allow adequate space for a much larger stadium, and free up space for desperately needed academic facilities on the main campus.\n\nThe university purchased land for the new stadium south of campus near the corner of Avenida Cesar Chavez and University Boulevard. This land became known as \"south campus,\" and would eventually become the home of the entire UNM Athletic Department. Today, facilities located on south campus include The Pit (now formally named Dreamstyle Arena), Isotopes Park, the Lobo Tennis Club, Lobo Field, Lobo Softball field, the Rudy Davalos Basketball Center, athletics administration buildings, as well as the football stadium. The new stadium was christened as University Stadium upon its opening in 1960. It consisted of grandstands along the east and west sidelines and a press box above the west stands. The stadium was built in an arroyo, with the seating bowl created by the piling of excavated fill material to form earthen embankments on which the stands could be built. This \"berm\" style of construction placed the field below ground level with seats extending both above and below the natural grade. The initial construction cost of the stadium was just over $4 million. The inaugural football game at University Stadium took place on September 17, 1960, with the Lobos defeating an overmatched National University of Mexico team by a score of 77-6.\n\nA new press box with private suites was built before the 1976 season at a cost of $1.8 million. Because the stadium had been built on earthen fill, the press box had to be supported on large concrete piers that went down to the pre-existing ground level. In 1995, UNM made a major addition to University Stadium with the construction of the L.F. \"Tow\" Diehm Athletic Facility, a field house and athletic training facility located just beyond the south end zone. The athletics department announced in late 2011 that grass playing field would be replaced with a synthetic playing surface. FieldTurf was chosen as the artificial turf system by the UNM athletic department, and it was in place for the 2012 football season.\n\nThrough the end of the 2017 season, Lobos Football has an all-time record of 163-168-3 at Dreamstyle Stadium.\n\nIn 2012, naming rights for the stadium's playing surface were secured by local attorneys Turner and Margaret Branch, who are alumni and long-time donors to the UNM athletic department. Their $1.5 million donation to the “Lobo Leap to Excellence” capital campaign remains the second-largest single gift ever given to the athletic department by a living donor. On May 3, 2017, UNM announced a $10 million, 10-year naming-rights agreement with Dreamstyle Remodeling, a local Albuquerque construction company, covering both the University Stadium and University Arena. The venues were rechristened as Dreamstyle Stadium and Dreamstyle Arena.\n\nThe stadium was expanded in 2001, with stands, new bathroom and concessions facilities constructed beyond the north end zone. UNM also added a large, state-of-the-art scoreboard that included the \"LoboVision\" video screen. In 2004, portable bleachers were donated to UNM by the city of Albuquerque in 2004 to take the stadium's capacity beyond 39,000. Plans for future expansion have been adopted. The next phase of expansion includes renovations of the stadium's southwest and southeast corners, as well as adding 5,000 seats to the south end of the stadium. Additionally, a tunnel connecting Dreamstyle Stadium and the Tow Diehm Facility has also been planned to allow easier player access to locker rooms during games. When the currently planned renovations are completed, the stadium will seat over 43,000 spectators.\n\nSince December 2006, University Stadium has hosted the New Mexico Bowl. The game was funded by a $2 million line of credit from ESPN, and the inaugural edition featured New Mexico against future Mountain West Conference foe San Jose State, then of the Western Athletic Conference. SJSU defeated UNM 20-12. The game was the first Division I bowl game played in the state of New Mexico. University Stadium had hosted the Division II national championship, named the Zia Bowl, in early December 1979 and 1980. In Zia Bowl I, Delaware defeated Youngstown State 38-21. In Zia Bowl II, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (now simply Cal Poly) beat Eastern Illinois 21-13. Attendance was 4,000 or less for both Zia Bowls, and in 1981 the Division II championship was moved to McAllen, Texas.\n\nUniversity Stadium hosted a U.S. women's national soccer team Women's World Cup qualifying match against Mexico in May 2004. Three U.S. men's national soccer team matches have been played in the stadium, with the most recent being a friendly match with Honduras in March 2005.\n\nThe stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Metallica & The Rolling Stones, among others.\n\nThe stadium recently hosted Nitro Circus Live.\n\n"}
{"id": "1901979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901979", "title": "Vaught–Hemingway Stadium", "text": "Vaught–Hemingway Stadium\n\nVaught–Hemingway Stadium at Hollingsworth Field is an outdoor athletic stadium located in Oxford, Mississippi, United States. The stadium serves as the home for the University of Mississippi Rebels college football team. The stadium is named after Johnny Vaught and Judge William Hemingway. Since its expansion in 2016, it is the largest stadium in the state of Mississippi with a capacity of 64,038 and also holds the state record for attendance at 66,176.\n\nBuilding of the stadium started in 1915 as a federally sponsored project. A series of expansions and renovations have gradually expanded the stadium and modernized its amenities, allowing the Rebels to play all of their home games on campus. Prior to the early to mid-1990s, Ole Miss would play many of its big rivalry games, including the heated feuds with LSU, Mississippi State, Tennessee, and Arkansas at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in the state capital of Jackson, located approximately south of the Ole Miss campus; and to a lesser extent, the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis. The Ole Miss-MSU game, commonly referred to as the Egg Bowl, was held in Jackson every year from 1973 through 1990 before returning to a home-and-home series.\n\nWhen the stadium opened, it was named for Judge William Hemingway, a professor of law and chairman of the university's committee on athletics. October 12, 1982 saw the addition of legendary Ole Miss coach Johnny Vaught's name to the stadium. September 5, 1998 saw the field named for longtime supporter Dr. Jerry Hollingsworth, bringing the current official title to \"Vaught-Hemingway Stadium at Hollingsworth Field\".\n\nIn 2002, construction crews replaced the south end zone bleachers with a rounded bowl, adding luxury boxes and covered club seating in an upper deck, as well as additional general admission seating for students and season ticket holders; these renovations expanded seating capacity by nearly 10,000, giving Vaught-Hemingway a capacity of 60,580. In August 2011 the school announced Forward Together, a new capital campaign that would seek to build a new basketball arena and expand the stadium. Phase 1 of the campaign includes adding 30 luxury suites and 770 club level seats. In addition new stadium lights, sound system, and 2 new video boards will be added to the current south end zone. Phase 2 calls for the stadium's capacity to increase giving it the ability to hold 64,038 fans. This would be done through closing off the north endzone. In addition a plaza would be built outside the north endzone to serve as a \"front door\" to the stadium and celebrate Ole Miss tradition and history. In the summer of 2012 Ole Miss announced that they had received a million-dollar gift that was to be used in the Forward Together capital campaign. The school announced in honor of the gift they would start a new tradition and include a bell tower in the north endzone expansion that would be rung before Ole Miss games to let fans know the game is starting soon and after Ole Miss victories. The most recent expansion, completed in 2016, completed the stadium's bowl shape and added 3,458 additional seats. This brought the total capacity to 64,038 making Vaught-Hemmingway the largest stadium in the state of Mississippi.\nOther notable upgrades include the installation of lights in 1990, a Jumbotron in 1997 and the replacement of the natural grass turf, which had become increasingly hard to maintain, with an AstroPlay artificial turf surface in 2003. Ironically, the stadium had been among the first in the nation to switch from a natural grass playing surface to artificial turf in 1970, and then one of the first of those stadiums to switch back to natural grass in 1984. The field surface was again changed in 2009 from AstroPlay to FieldTurf, making Ole Miss the first team in the Southeastern Conference to play their home games on the surface.\n\nIn 2004, a indoor practice facility and locker room facility was opened. This facility is linked to the existing stadium via a secured tunnel.\n\nFor the 2008 season, Vaught–Hemingway Stadium got a new HD Daktronics video board to replace the Sony Jumbotron that had been installed in the north Endzone in 1997. The new board is the 8th largest scoreboard in NCAA college football (fourth in the Southeastern conference), measuring in at by (4,032 square feet). Ole Miss' board cost $6 million, all of which was paid for by Telesouth Communications as part of a multimedia rights agreement with the University.\n\nIn 2016, Vaught-Hemingway upgraded to three new 13mm pixel HD video boards by Daktronics. The North board measures 48 ft (14 m) by 104.5 ft (31 m) (5,016 square feet) and the two South boards measure 30 ft (9 m) by 49 ft (15 m) (1,470 square feet).\n\n\n"}

He was best known as the eldest son of former Prime Minister and President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Since December 2001, he held the official position of Roving Ambassador and High Commissioner, representing Fiji's interests in Pacific Island nations. It was reported on 13 March 2006 that he had been chosen to succeed his late father as Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, but in 2009 the succession was still unclear, with Mara reportedly refusing to discuss the issue with the village elders.\n\nMara graduated from New Zealand's University of Otago with an LLB (Law) degree in 1983. This was followed by an LLM (Master's degree in Law) from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom in 1986. Meanwhile, he had served as a Legal Officer in the Attorney General's Chamber from 1984, rising to Principal Legal Officer in 1986. In 1987, he was appointed Fiji's Chief Administrative Officer for Foreign Affairs, and in 1991 he became Chargé d'affaires at the Fijian Embassy in Washington, D.C..\n\nUpon returning to Fiji, Mara was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 and served for a single term. During this time, he held Cabinet office as Minister for Fijian Affairs from 1997 to 1999, during which time he also served as Chairman of the Native Land Trust Board. He also led the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998. In 1999 he was appointed to a diplomatic post, but returned to Fiji in the wake of the coup d'état that deposed his father from the Presidency in 2000. The following year, however, he took up his post as Roving Ambassador and High Commissioner.\n\nOn 13 August 2005, Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola said that Mara was being considered as a possible successor to Ratu Tevita Momoedonu as Ambassador to Japan. Momoedonu's term was due to expire in September, and he had indicated that he wished to return to Fiji. In the end, Mara was not appointed, however.\n\nIn 2006 Mara was appointed ambassador to the United States but did not take up the position. He was again appointed to the position in 2008. His departure from Fiji to take up the post was reportedly delayed by \"internal processes\" in the Ministry of foreign Affairs. The offer was eventually withdrawn with the government citing Mara's inability to meet a deadline due to protracted personal affairs. The Fijian ambassador to the United States as of December 2010 was Winston Thompson.\n\nOn 18 March 2005, it was announced that five elders from his home island of Lakeba had visited him in Suva to invite him to succeed his late father as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands. Although not strictly hereditary, the title is traditionally held by a male in the chiefly Vuanirewa Clan, a tradition his father reportedly wanted upheld. One village elder, who chose not to be named, said that Mara had both the blood ties and the modern education expected of a Paramount Chief. \"\"He is a high chief, whose parents are both paramount chiefs and have strong blood ties with all the chiefly households in Fiji and Tonga, is young and can look after his people,\"\" the elder said.\n\nOthers expressed disappointment, however, that the elders had gone public before Ratu Finau had made a final decision on accepting the invitation, saying that the publicity was an insult to him and the other children of the late Ratu Mara.\n\nAs of July 2005, there was still no public announcement as to whether Mara had accepted the invitation to become the Tui Nayau, but his elder sister, Adi Ateca Ganilau, said that discussions between the family and the \"mataqali\" (clan) were ongoing. She said there was no time limit; her father had been installed only after three years of discussions.\n\nOn 13 March 2006, the Fiji Village news service quoted Lau Provincial Council Chairman Ratu Josefa Basulu as saying that Mara had accepted an invitation from the chiefly Vuanirewa clan to succeed his late father as \"Tui Nayau\", or Paramount Chief of Lau. A date for installation had yet to be finalized, he said.\n\nMara had two children (Ratu Salesi Kinikinilau Mara and Adi Lawedua Rokolubatilakeba Mara) with Vitinia Tualau Buadromo.

Primarily used for American football, it is the home field of the Duke Blue Devils. It opened in 1929 with a game against Pitt, as the first facility in Duke's new West Campus. Originally named Duke Stadium, it was renamed in 1967 for football coach Wallace Wade and has remained Wallace Wade Stadium ever since. The playing surface was renamed Brooks Field at the beginning of the 2015 season after the removal of the track and lowering of the field level seats.\n\nWallace Wade Stadium opened in 1929 as \"Duke Stadium\". The stadium was largely funded with bonds—the school advertised for \"1,000 individuals to invest $100 in Duke's athletic future\" and offered 6% interest.\n\nThe stadium is notable for being the site of the 1942 Rose Bowl Game. Duke had won the invitation to the game as the eastern representative. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor, just weeks after the end of the 1941 season, led to fears of a Japanese attack on the West Coast. General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, advised the Tournament of Roses Association not to hold the game at the Rose Bowl Stadium itself, since he was not willing to take a chance on the Japanese choosing to stage a bombing raid on a stadium with over 90,000 people in attendance. Soon afterward, the government banned all large public gatherings on the West Coast, which ruled out Bell Field on the campus of Oregon State, the host team from the PCC, as an alternative venue. The Tournament of Roses Association originally planned to cancel the game, but Duke officials invited the Rose Bowl and Oregon State to Durham to play the game. The offer was accepted, and on a cold, rainy January 1, 1942, 56,000 fans, 22,000 of whom sat on bleachers borrowed from nearby NC State and UNC, watched the heavily favored Blue Devils fall to the strong defense of the Beavers 20–16. It is still the only time the game has been played outside of Pasadena, California.\n\nIn 1967, Duke Stadium was renamed Wallace Wade Stadium in honor of legendary Duke coach Wallace Wade.\n\nIn 1972, Wallace Wade Stadium hosted the first edition of the Pelican Bowl, a short-lived attempt at a black college football national championship game between the winner of the MEAC and the winner of the SWAC. Grambling defeated NC Central by a score of 56-6 in front of 22,500 fans. \nIn October 2012, Duke announced major renovations projected to eventually seat 43,915.\n\nIn 2015, Steve Brooks, Duke alumnus and CEO of the Phoenix American Insurance Group, donated $13 million to the Duke Athletics department. The playing surface was renamed Brooks Field in his honor.\n\nIn September 2014, renovation plans were released. The new stadium would seat nearly 40,000 and have 21 luxury suites housed within a new five-story, tower along the stadium’s west side. A new high by wide LED video board would be installed closer to the field than the previous one. Another notable feature was the removal of the stadium’s track, which allowed 4,000 additional seats to be added along with lowering and recentering the field. The concourses along the stadium’s north and west sides were enhanced with new concessions and new gates, restroom facilities and first aid stations. Integrated seating in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act were also added for disabled guests and their companions. The first two phases of the renovations were finished over a two-year period, including the new press box, eight broadcast booths and suites completed by the 2016 college football season.\n\nPhase three was completed prior to the 2017 season. It included completion of ADA boxes currently in one-third of the concourse on the north and east concourse, rebuilding the concourse surface, and construction of a north gate ticket booth and various concessions, bathroom, and future store buildings on the east concourse. The alumni box on the north concourse was also be replaced with a new auxiliary scoreboard.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for college football and is the home field of the Iowa State Cyclones. It opened on September 20, 1975, with a 17–12 win over Air Force.\n\nIt is the third-largest stadium by capacity in the Big 12 Conference behind Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium and Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, and the third-newest in the conference, behind only Milan Puskar Stadium of West Virginia (which had its design based on Jack Trice Stadium) and Baylor's McLane Stadium. Including hillside seats in the corners of the stadium, the facility's official capacity is 61,500. The school announced in May 2014 a planned expansion to 61,500.\n\nThe current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones defeated the University of Northern Iowa 31-7.\n\nJack Trice Stadium replaced Clyde Williams Field, which had been in use from 1914 through 1974. Williams Field was closed in 1975 and razed in 1978, and Martin and Eaton residence halls now stand on the ground.\n\nThe stadium consists of double-decked grandstands running the length of either sideline and encompassing the south end zone. The Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, an athletic center built in 1996, is located in the north end zone. The field itself is slightly lower than the surrounding ground. There is a single main concourse for each of the grandstands. A three-level press box on the west side of the stadium was added to the stadium in 1997 for a cost of $6.2 million. Permanent lighting and a large video/scoreboard behind the bleachers in the south end zone were added in 2002. Later in the summer of 2011 a second video/scoreboard was added on the north side. At triple the size of the previous scoreboard, it stands over the Jacobson Athletic Building. Both scoreboards consist of three levels on the inside, with a camera perch on top. The stadium is part of the Iowa State Center, a sports, entertainment and continuing education complex located to the southeast of the university's main campus. North of the stadium is Hilton Coliseum, home to Iowa State Cyclones basketball, wrestling, volleyball and gymnastics teams, as well as other events such as musical festivals, rock concerts and university commencement ceremonies.\n\nIn 1975, the stadium's playing field was named in honor of Jack Trice, Iowa State's first African American athlete and the school's first athlete to die of injuries sustained during a Cyclone athletic competition.\n\nOn October 6, 1923, Trice and his Iowa State College teammates played against the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Because he was African American, on the night of the game, Trice had to stay at a different Minneapolis hotel than his teammates.\n\nDuring the second play of the game, Trice's collarbone was broken. Trice insisted he was all right and returned to the game. In the third quarter, while attempting to tackle a University of Minnesota ball carrier by throwing a roll block, Trice was trampled by three Minnesota players. Although he claimed to be fine, Trice was removed from the game and sent to a Minneapolis hospital. The doctors declared him fit to travel and he returned by train to Ames with his teammates. On October 8, 1923, Trice died from hemorrhaged lungs and internal bleeding as a result of the injuries sustained during the game.\n\nThere was a great deal of speculation surrounding the play that resulted in Jack Trice's death. Many of his teammates claimed after the fact that the Gophers targeted him throughout the first two quarters because of his skin color. ISU teammate Johnny Behm told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in a 1979 interview, \"One person told me that nothing out of the ordinary happened. But another who saw it said it was murder.\" \n\nIowa State dismissed all classes after 3 p.m. on October 9, 1923 in honor of Trice, who wore the number \"37\" in his short career at Iowa State.\n\nTrice's funeral was held at the Iowa State College central campus in Ames on October 16, 1923, with 4,000 students and faculty members in attendance. Before he was buried, his casket was draped in Iowa State's school colors, cardinal and gold.\n\nAs a result of his death, ISU did not renew their contract to play against Minnesota after the 1924 game. They would not play again until 1989.\n\nUntil 1997, the facility itself was known as Cyclone Stadium. Because of persistent requests by the students, the facility was renamed Jack Trice Stadium, making it the only one in Division I FBS named for an African American individual.\n\nJack Trice Stadium was completed in less than two years, from its ground breaking on Oct. 26, 1973, to the first game, a victory over Air Force on Sept. 20, 1975. In late 1973 and spring of 1974, heavy earth-moving equipment shaped the embankments. A huge, movable form shaped the lower decks with thousands of cubic yards of concrete. Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 42,500.\n\n1976\nIn 1976, bleachers were constructed in the end zones to increase the stadium's capacity to more than 46,000 (50,000 with standing room tickets). Before then, all the seating was in the grandstands on the sidelines.\n\n1995–1997\nThe stadium complex was transformed in 1995-96 with the construction of the state-of-the-art $10.6 million Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, in the north end-zone of Jack Trice Stadium. The Jacobson Building is the home of Cyclone athletics containing all sport and administrative offices except men's and women's basketball and volleyball. The Ralph A. Olsen Building was also renovated at that time and it sits attached to the north end of the Jacobson Athletic Building. The Olsen Building, named in honor of prominent Ellsworth farmer and ISU alumnus, houses the strength and conditioning facilities, the team meeting rooms, and the locker rooms.\n\nIn 1996, a natural grass field and new drainage system made its debut, the field had been AstroTurf since 1975. In 1997, the $6.2 million, three-level press tower located on the west side was added to Jack Trice Stadium. The new press tower includes press and radio-television levels and nine sky box suites.\n\n2002\nThe football atmosphere at Jack Trice Stadium was enhanced with the installation of a new million-dollar videoboard and scoreboard which replace its black and white predecessor. Permanent lighting was also added to the side of the stadium for the 2002 season at a cost of $500,000. Since then, ISU has played twice as many home night games as they did the previous 30 years.\n2007–2009\nBetween the 2007 and 2009 football seasons, Jack Trice received its largest renovation project to date. With the completion of $30 million in renovations, the stadium has 22 new suites, a new wider concourses with new concessions and bathrooms on the east and west side, a new club section, improved disability seating, new fencing and gates, a new plaza near the main entrance, and many preservative renovations throughout the stadium.\n\nThe changes to suites also includes the expansion of two existing suites on the west side of the stadium and the installation of operable windows in all of the current suites. Funding for these renovations came completely from the sale of stadium suites, club seats, increased ticket revenues and fund raising.\n\nRichard O. \"Dick\" Jacobson donated $5 million to ISU athletics in 2008, for the purpose of continuing renovations to Jack Trice Stadium. There will be a Jacobson Plaza constructed near the stadiums main entrance in his honor. This donation was the largest donation ever made to ISU athletics.\n\n2011 \nA new video/scoreboard was installed on the north end of Jack Trice Stadium. The screen measures 36 feet high and 79.5 feet wide and has a resolution of 720 x 1,584. The new video board was completed for the 2011 football season.\n\n2015\n\nOn May 1, 2008, ISU Athletic Department was given permission from the Iowa Board of Regents to continue planning and fund raising for the Jack Trice Expansion. On November 25, 2013 it was announced that the Reiman family would donate $25 million to help complete the south end-zone project estimated at $60 million. Iowa State Athletics gained approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for the construction of the south end-zone final phase on February 6, 2014. Athletic Director Jamie Pollard has stated the target date of the south end-zone project was to complete the expansion before the start of the 2015 football season. This expansion brought capacity from 54,800 to 61,500.\n\nThis south end-zone addition included enclosing the south end zone, which included an upper deck, and connected the east side concourse to the west side concourse. Originally, the south end-zone project was scheduled to be completed at the same time as the east concourse renovation; however, funding was not secured for the south end-zone expansion, so the two projects were completed separately.\n\nOn a call in show, ISU athletic director stated that more facility improvements will be continuing over the next few years. Iowa State's head football coach Paul Rhoads has also made similar comments.

{"id": "1902021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902021", "title": "Herrerasaurus", "text": "Herrerasaurus\n\nHerrerasaurus was one of the earliest dinosaurs. Its name means \"Herrera's lizard\", after the rancher who discovered the first specimen in 1958 in South America. All known fossils of this carnivore have been discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation of Carnian age (late Triassic according to the ICS, dated to 231.4 million years ago) in northwestern Argentina. The type species, Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, was described by Osvaldo Reig in 1963 and is the only species assigned to the genus. \"Ischisaurus\" and \"Frenguellisaurus\" are synonyms.\n\nFor many years, the classification of \"Herrerasaurus\" was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, with the discovery of an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, \"Herrerasaurus\" has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.\n\nIt is a member of the Herrerasauridae, a family of similar genera that were among the earliest of the dinosaurian evolutionary radiation.\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Adults had skulls up to long and were up to in total length and in weight. Smaller specimens were half the size, with skulls only about long.\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" was fully bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, indicating that it was likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of \"Herrerasaurus\" were less than half the length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" displays traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most of the characteristics of dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in \"Allosaurus\".\n\"Herrerasaurus\" had a long, narrow skull that lacked nearly all the specializations that characterized later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as \"Euparkeria\". It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae and a pair of tiny, slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" had a flexible joint in the lower jaw that could slide back and forth to deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.\n\nAccording to Novas (1993), \"Herrerasaurus\" can be distinguished based on the following features: the presence of a premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% of the size of the humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.\n\nAccording to Sereno (1993), \"Herrerasaurus\" can be distinguished based on the following features, all of which are unknown in other herrerasaurids: a circular pit is present on the humeral ectepicondyle, a feature also present in \"Saturnalia\"; a saddle-shaped ulnar condyle of the humerus, and the articular surface for the ulnare on the ulna is convex; the articular surface of the ulnare is smaller than that of the ulna, a feature unknown in \"Staurikosaurus\" and \"Sanjuansaurus\"; the centrale is placed distal to the radiale; a broad subnarial process of the premaxilla, and a broad supratemporal depression (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993); the basal tuber and the occipital condyle are subequal in width (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993).\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" was named by paleontologist Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean goatherd who first noticed its fossils in outcrops near the city of San Juan, Argentina in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded \"Eoraptor\", are part of the Ischigualasto Formation and date from the late Ladinian to early Carnian stages of the Late Triassic period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these rocks in the same publication as \"Herrerasaurus\"; this dinosaur, \"Ischisaurus cattoi\", is now considered a junior synonym and a juvenile of \"Herrerasaurus\".\n\nReig believed \"Herrerasaurus\" was an early example of a carnosaur, but this was the subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified \"Herrerasaurus\" as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using cladistic analysis, some researchers put \"Herrerasaurus\" and \"Staurikosaurus\" at the base of the dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.\n\nTwo other partial skeletons, with skull material, were named \"Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis\" by Fernando Novas in 1986, but this species too is now thought to be a synonym. \"Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis\" was discovered in 1975, and was described by Novas (1986) who considered it a primitive saurischian, and possibly a theropod. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) examined the \"Frenguellisaurus\" remains and found them referable to \"Herrerasaurus\". \"Ischisaurus cattoi\" was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) reviewed its remains and found them to be referable to \"Herrerasaurus\".\nA complete \"Herrerasaurus\" skull was found in 1988, by a team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno. Based on the new fossils, authors such as Thomas Holtz and José Bonaparte classified \"Herrerasaurus\" at the base of the saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods. However, Sereno favored classifying \"Herrerasaurus\" (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod hypothesis, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and Benton (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis. If \"Herrerasaurus\" were indeed a theropod, it would indicate that theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids, before the middle Carnian, and that \"all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum\". This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur. These footprints date from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate \"Herrerasaurus\" by 3 to 5 million years.\n\nThe study of early dinosaurs such as \"Herrerasaurus\" and \"Eoraptor\" therefore has important implications for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of \"Herrerasaurus\" by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of \"Herrerasaurus\" also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.\n\n\"Herrerasaurus\" was originally considered to be a genus within Carnosauria, which then included forms similar to \"Megalosaurus\" and \"Antrodemus\" (the latter is equivalent to \"Allosaurus\"), even though \"Herrerasaurus\" lived many millions of years before them and retained multiple primitive features. This carnosaurian classification was amended upon by Rozhdestvensky and Tatarinov in 1964, who classified \"Herrerasaurus\" within the family Gryponichidae inside Carnosauria. The same year, Walker published a differing opinion that \"Herrerasaurus\" instead was allied with Plateosauridae, although it differed in possessing a pubic boot. Walker also proposed that \"Herrerasaurus\" may instead be close to \"Poposaurus\" (now considered a pseudosuchian) and the unnamed theropod from the Dockum Group of Texas (now assigned to the rauisuchian \"Postosuchus\"). In 1985, Charig noted that \"Herrerasaurus\" was of uncertain classification, showing similarities to both \"prosauropods\" and \"carnosaurians\". Romer (1966), simply noted that \"Herrerasaurus\" was a prosauropod possibly within Plateosauridae. In the description of \"Staurikosaurus\", Colbert noted that there were many similarities between his taxon and \"Herrerasaurus\", but classified them in separate families, with \"Herrerasaurus\" in Teratosauridae. In 1970, Bonaparte also proposed similarities between \"Herrerasaurus\" and \"Staurikosaurus\", and while classifying them both clearly as in Saurischia, he stated that they appeared as though they could not be placed in a current family. This was further supported by Benedetto in 1973, who named for the taxa the new family Herrerasauridae, which he classified as saurischians, possibly within Theropoda but not in Sauropodomorpha. However, in 1977 Galton proposed that Herrerasauridae only included \"Herrerasaurus\", and found it to be Saurischian \"incertae sedis\".\n\nProposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, \"Herrerasaurus\" has at times been considered basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to be inside Dinosauria. They supported this on the basis that \"Herrerasaurus\" has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered \"Staurikosaurus\" and \"Herrerasaurus\" to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphies state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of \"Herrerasaurus\" and \"Staurikosaurus\" and all its descendants. A differing definition of \"Herrerasaurus\" but not \"Passer domesticus\" first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as \"Herrerasaurus\" but not \"Liliensternus\" or \"Plateosaurus\" by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.\n\nIn a revision of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed the definition of the clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of \"Triceratops\" and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and \"Eoraptor\". Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and \"Eoraptor\" lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.\n\nA later 1994 study by Novas instead classified \"Herrerasaurus\" within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas found that the primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for \"Herrerasaurus\" with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than \"Eoraptor\" or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place \"Herrerasaurus\" as well as \"Eoraptor\" basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, and found that it was much more likely that \"Herrerasaurus\" was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of \"Tawa\", when Nesbitt \"et al.\" conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to \"Eoraptor\", but closer to \"Dilophosaurus\" than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon \"Chromogisaurus\", and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.\n\nIn 2010, Alcocer and Martinez described a new taxon of herrerasaurid, \"Sanjuansaurus\". It could be distinguished from \"Herrerasaurus\" based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, \"Herrerasaurus\", \"Sanjuansaurus\" and \"Staurikosaurus\" all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, \"Eoraptor\" and \"Guaibasaurus\". In 2011, Martinez \"et al.\" described \"Eodromaeus\", a basal theropod from the same formation as \"Herrerasaurus\". In a phylogenetic analysis, \"Eoraptor\" was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most basal theropods, and \"Eodromaeus\" was placed as the next most basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt \"et al.\" (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with \"Eoraptor\" also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.\n\nOther members of the clade may include \"Eoraptor\" from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as \"Herrerasaurus\", \"Chindesaurus\" from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and possibly \"Caseosaurus\" from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, \"Alwalkeria\" from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and \"Teyuwasu\", known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted that it had been incorrectly suggested that \"Staurikosaurus pricei\" was a juvenile \"Herrerasaurus\". This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile \"Herrerasaurus\" were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of \"Staurikosaurus\".\n\nThe teeth of \"Herrerasaurus\" indicate that it was a carnivore; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as \"Pisanosaurus\", as well as the more plentiful rhynchosaurs and synapsids. \"Herrerasaurus\" itself may have been preyed upon by giant rauisuchids like \"Saurosuchus\"; puncture wounds were found in one skull.\n\nCoprolites (fossilized dung) containing small bones but no trace of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to \"Herrerasaurus\" based on fossil abundance. Mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicates that if the referral to \"Herrerasaurus\" was correct, this carnivore could digest bone.\nComparisons between the scleral rings of \"Herrerasaurus\" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.\n\nIn a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 12 hand bones and 20 foot bones referred to \"Herrerasaurus\" were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.\n\nPVSJ 407, a \"Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis\", had a pit in a skull bone attributed by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits occurred on the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, it is likely that they were obtained in a fight with another \"Herrerasaurus\".\n\nThe holotype of \"Herrerasaurus\" (PVL 2566) was discovered in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan, Argentina. It was collected in 1961 by Victorino Herrera, in sediments that were deposited in the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 221 million years ago. Over the years, the Ischigualasto Formation produced other fossils ultimately referred to \"Herrerasaurus\". In 1958, A.S. Romer discovered specimen MCZ 7063, originally referred to \"Staurikosaurus\" in Carnian sediments. \"Herrerasaurus\" specimens PVL 2045 and MLP(4)61, were collected in 1959 and 1960, respectively, in sediments that were deposited in the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. In 1960, Scaglia collected specimen MACN 18.060, originally the holotype of \"Ischisaurus cattoi\", in sediments deposited in the Carnian stage. In 1961, Scaglia collected \"Herrerasaurus\" specimen PVL 2558, in the Carnian beds of this formation. In 1990, the Cancha de Bochas Member produced more \"Herrerasaurus\" specimens, also from its Carnian beds. Specimen PVSJ 53, originally the holotype of \"Frenguellisaurus\", was collected by Gargiulo & Oñate in 1975 in sediments that were deposited in the Carnian stage.\n\nAlthough \"Herrerasaurus\" shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived during a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% of the total number of fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.\n\nStudies suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was moist and warm, though subject to seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of ferns (\"Cladophlebis\"), horsetails, and giant conifers (\"Protojuniperoxylon\"). These plants formed lowland forests along the banks of rivers. \"Herrerasaurus\" remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic South America alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long \"Eoraptor\", as well as \"Saurosuchus\", a giant land-living rauisuchian (a quadrupedal meat eater with a theropod-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller \"Venaticosuchus\", an ornithosuchid; and the predatory therapsid chiniquodontids. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by rhynchosaurs such as \"Hyperodapedon\" (a beaked reptile); aetosaurs (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including kannemeyeriid dicynodonts (stocky, front-heavy-beaked quadrupedal animals) such as \"Ischigualastia\" and traversodontid cynodonts (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as \"Exaeretodon\".\n\n"}
