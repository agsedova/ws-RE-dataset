It is referred to as \"Pomorski Uniwersytet Medyczny\" in Polish.\n\nViewed from a historical perspective, a period of 53 years, when compared with the multicentennial tradition of other universities, is short indeed. When one considers that Szczecin was never a seat of schools of higher learning and the establishment of the university took place just after an exceptionally devastating war with local physicians, scientists and teachers missing altogether, one must admit that 50 years of active existence of the university is an outstanding achievement.\n\nThe first organizers of the Pomeranian Medical University were Prof. Jakub Wegierko (first rector) and professors: Tadeusz Chorazak, Artur Chwalibogowski, Tadeusz Markiewicz, Czeslaw Murczynski, Tadeusz Sokolowski, Witold Starkiewicz, Kazimierz Stojalowski, Jozef Taniewski and January Zubrzycki. Soon to join them were professors: Izabela Cwojdzinska-Gadzikiewicz, Lech Dzialoszynski, Adam Krechowiecki, Wanda Murczynska, Jan Slotwinski, Eugeniusz Mietkiewski, Edward Gorzkowski, Irena Semadeni, Boleslaw Gornicki.\n\nOwing to the significant number of professors settling in Szczecin, the Pomeranian Medical University became the sole school of higher learning in this town bestowed with full academic powers to hold doctoral and habilitated doctor studies and grant doctoral degrees.\n\nThe passion and efforts of the pioneers resulted in an increasing number of students and academic teachers, a widening scope and rising level of specialized health services, and in scientific research of growing importance.\n\nIn spite of financial and technical difficulties new lecture halls, student hostels and other buildings of social use were erected. These include two new lecture halls in the First and Second State Clinical Hospitals, three new hostels, the Main Library, one sports hall, three vacations centres, etc. Modern buildings for the Department of Clinical Biochemistry and for the Department of Psychiatry were erected.\n\nAt present the university has more than 1,370 beds in both State Clinical Hospitals and almost 400 beds in other hospitals in Szczecin. Altogether, there are approximately 1,780 beds in the clinical departments and the number of patients treated yearly exceeds 32,000.\n\nClinical departments of the University, besides offering sophisticated health care services for the Western Pomerania region, provide basic medical care because Szczecin does not possess a municipal hospital. Furthermore, the outpatient departments are an important element of the treatment and services base of the region, acting chiefly as specialized consultancy centres with a yearly number of visits exceeding 160,000.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2009 of young academic teachers in PMU procure prestigious scholarships of Polish Science Foundation. Presently the University has 1478 students, including 1012 students of medicine and 466 of dentistry.\n\nStudents' Scientific Association at PMU organises annual nationwide and international Medical Students’ Conference.\n\nThe Pomeranian Medical University has more than 500 faculty and almost 200 technical staff. Among the academic staff are 43 professors and 54 habilitated doctors. Since 1948 8060 physicians and 3314 dentists graduated from the University. 1113 researchers obtained the degree of doctor and 196 of habilitated doctor. Actually University employ 33 professors and 36 extraordinary professors.\n\nThe title of doctor honoris causa was granted to 15 renowned scientists: Prof. Dr. Witold Starkiewicz (1973), Prof. Dr. Kazimierz Stojalowski (1974), Prof. Dr. Eugeniusz Mietkiewski (1985), Prof. Dr. Jerzy Kulczycki (1987), Prof. Dr. Andre Raymond Ardaillou (1991), Prof. Dr. Marek Eisner (1992), Prof. Dr. Zbigniew Janczuk (1994), Prof. Dr. Franciszek Kokot (1995), Prof. Dr. Leonidas Samochowiec (1995), Prof. Dr. Hans Schadewaldt (1995), Prof. Dr. Eberhard Ritz (1996), Prof. Dr. Dietrich Kettler (1996), prof. Mary Osborne (1997), prof. Stanislaw Woyke (1998), prof. Alan Gewirtz (1999).\n\nNew, unconventional forms of teaching have been adopted during the academic year 1996/97. These are: extramural studies in nursing leading to the title of master, studies for English-speaking students from Scandinavia, Europe, Israel, Canada and more, evening full-pay studies in medicine,The Faculty of Pharmacy shall be established in the near future.\nSince long the Pomeranian Medical University maintains scientific ties with renowned foreign centres. Apart from previous co-operation with some centres in the European Union, the agreement signed with the Pennsylvania University in Philadelphia may be called the most important. These contacts have resulted in the exchange of junior scientists, as well as in numerous publications in reputable Western journals.\n\nThe strongest advantage of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin lies in its staff - scientists, teachers and physicians - well-educated and strongly motivated to do a good job, in many instances keeping pace with forefront of world medicine.\n\nHopefully, some shortcomings as to the facilities and instrumentation may be overcome in the coming years, thanks to the commitment and enthusiasm of the staff of the Pomeranian Medical University. Hopefully, the co-operation with the health service system in the region, as well as with the Ministry and the Scientific Research Committee shall be even better.\n\nThe present authorities of the University have set many goals for the incoming years. The most important one is to improve the curriculum by modernizing and making more attractive the forms of teaching so that students graduating from our University be well prepared to meet the needs of their profession, but also call the period of studies as one of the best in their lives.\n\nStudents wanting more of their studies may deepen their knowledge and become acquainted with the methodology of scientific research by joining one of some 20 Student Scientific Groups, now with almost 100 members. On December 6-7th, 2000, All-Polish Conference of the Student Scientific Groups was held. Furthermore, members of the Student Scientific Society participate in national and foreign conferences. Following their graduation and an internship of 12 months some of these students join the staff of their Alma Mater each year.\n\nImportant centres for information and documentation, indispensable for research activities, are the Main Library and the Publishing Division of PMU.\n\nThe Main Library continues to grow since 1949, albeit with varying pace over the years. It has two sections in the Clinical Hospitals, stores more than 260,000 books and offers 584 periodicals. Scientific, experimental, clinical, historical and bibliographic papers appear in the Annals of the university since 1950. Initially, the Annals were published irregularly in the form of separate collections of papers, but since 1962 they constitute a regular, reviewed scientific publication under the title of \"Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis\" indexed i.a. in Index Medicus. In principle, the Annals contain condensed versions of doctoral theses, while supplements usually contain habilitated doctor theses.\n\nThe Publishing Division is the editor of other publications such as handbooks for students, post-graduate education aids, medical and administrative guide-books, growing steadily since 1969.\n\nThe university consists of four faculties:\n\nThe university has also English programme for foreign students. They intend to establish a faculty of Pharmacy in the future.\n\n\n\n"}

Wim Wenders was elected Chairman. Two years later, the European Cinema Society was renamed European Film Academy and was registered as a non-profit association.\n\nIn 1996, Wim Wenders took over the presidency from Ingmar Bergman, and the British producer Nik Powell was elected new Chairman. The decisions about political targets and contents are made by the 15 Board members of the Academy which has its seat in Berlin.\n\nDue to a decision of the General Assembly, the number of members—originally limited to 99—has been continuously increasing and has now reached 3,300 (as of January 2015). The Academy is thus working in close contact with the European film industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nlisted are all countries with more than 20 EFA members\n\nThe European Film Academy is mainly funded by the Stiftung Deutsche Klassenlotterie Berlin (German National Lottery), the German State Minister for Culture and the Media, and Filmboard Berlin-Brandenburg GmbH. The presentation of the European Film Awards are financed independently from the Academy. Founded in 2006 to produce the European Film Awards Ceremony for television, EFA Productions gGmbH is the in-house production company of the European Film Academy e.V. For a number of years, the European Film Awards have been supported by patrons from the international film industry. Their commitment demonstrates the importance that the international film industry attaches to the European Film Awards.\n\nThroughout the year, the European Film Academy (EFA) initiates and participates in a series of activities dealing with film politics as well as economic, artistic, and training aspects. The programme includes conferences, seminars and workshops, and a common goal is to build a bridge between creativity and the industry. Some of EFA's events have already become an institution for encounters within the European film community:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annual European Film Awards ceremony (until 1997 known as FELIX) is the most visible activity of the European Film Academy. With the awards the Academy pursues the following aims: attracting the interest of the audience in European cinema, promoting its cultural and artistic qualities, and regaining the public's confidence in its entertainment value. To put these ideas into practice, the People's Choice Awards were added as a new category in 1997. They are accompanied by big advertising campaigns in European film magazines. In addition, screenings of the nominated films were in the past years organised for the public in several European cities (Berlin, Edinburgh, London, Stockholm, Strasbourg, Warsaw).\n\nThe members of the European Film Academy actively participate in the selection, nomination and awarding procedure.\n\nThe European Film Awards are the first in the annual international awards calendar. Most of the nominees and winners of the European Film Awards are found in the following months among the nominees and winners of the Golden Globes or the Oscars. In the past years, European producers and distributors repeatedly stressed that a nomination or receipt of the European Film Award had a positive impact on the destiny of their films with regard to the Golden Globe or the Oscar.\n\nEvery year, the academy organises a sidebar programme on the occasion of the European Film Awards week-end with panel discussions and conferences. Thus, innovative production methods for the new millennium were discussed at the conference which took place in Berlin in 1999, whereas in 2000, nine European filmmakers of international reputation (among them, Wim Wenders, Liv Ullmann, Tom Tykwer, Dominik Moll, Pavel Lungin, Maria de Medeiros) as well as the EU commissioner Viviane Reding made very personal and visionary speeches on the artistic, cultural, and social role of cinema in front of 800 guests at Theâtre de l'Odéon in Paris, where the conference E LA NAVE VA - For a New Energy in European Cinema was held.\n\n\n"}

The plan failed, and in 1880 the Vermont section was reorganized and leased by the Boston & Lowell Railroad. In 1886, the Maine and New Hampshire section was reorganized as the Portland & Ogdensburg Railway. That part was leased to the Maine Central Railroad in 1888, and in 1912 the Maine Central leased the eastern part of the Vermont section from the Boston & Maine Railroad, the successor to the B&L.\n\nThe Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad was chartered on February 11, 1867 to run from Portland to Fabyan, a junction at Carroll, New Hampshire in the White Mountains, where the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad would continue west. Their track joined in a ceremony at the summit of Crawford Notch on August 7, 1875, then opened on August 16, 1875.\n\nIn 1864, the Essex County Railroad was chartered to run from St. Johnsbury, Vermont, on the Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, east to Lunenburg on the border with New Hampshire. The Montpelier & St. Johnsbury Railroad was chartered in 1866 to run west from St. Johnsbury to Montpelier. The Lamoille Valley Railroad was chartered in 1867 to run from West Danville on the planned M&SJ northwest to Swanton. The three companies were consolidated on August 7, 1875 to form the Vermont Division of the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad, and the construction that had started was continued, except that the part of the M&SJ west of West Danville was never built.\n\nConstruction on the Vermont Division began in 1871, and was complete in 1877. To connect between the two divisions, the company at first used trackage rights over the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad from Fabyan to Dalton, New Hampshire, but soon built its own alignment. West of Swanton, the P&O was allied with the Ogdensburgh & Lake Champlain Railroad, running west from Rouses Point, New York to Ogdensburg, and used the Vermont & Canada Railroad to access it.\n\nThe Montreal, Portland & Boston Railway opened in 1876 from Montreal, Quebec to the national border, and was planned to continue into Vermont as a branch of the P&O.\n\nJust after completion of the Vermont Division the company went bankrupt, was taken over by the receiver on October 19, 1877. The Vermont Division was reorganized as the St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain Railroad on January 31, 1880. On August 9, 1882 the Montreal, Portland & Boston Railway leased it, but it was soon taken over by the Boston & Lowell Railroad.\nThe main division was reorganized on June 8, 1884 as the Portland & Ogdensburg Railway, and on August 20, 1888, the Maine Central Railroad leased it as their Mountain Division (some of which survives as the Conway Scenic Railroad, a heritage railroad). In July 1912, the Maine Central Railroad leased the old Vermont Division, but on August 1, 1927 the lease was terminated, and a new lease was made on only the part east of St. Johnsbury. The remainder of the Vermont Division operated as the St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain Railroad until reorganized as the St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County Railroad in 1948.\n\n"}

{"id": "2312979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2312979", "title": "Sense (electronics)", "text": "Sense (electronics)\n\nIn electronics, sense is a technique used in power supplies to produce the correct voltage for a load. Although simple batteries naturally maintain a steady voltage (except in cases of large internal impedance), a power supply must use a feedback system to make adjustments based on the difference between its intended output and its actual output. If this system is working, the latter will be very close to the former.\n\nTwo types of sense are used, depending on where the power supply output is measured. In local sense, the supply simply measures the voltage at its output terminals, where the leads to the load connect. This method has the problem of not accounting for the voltage drop due to resistance of the leads, which is proportional to the amount of current drawn by the load. That is, the supply might be producing the correct voltage at its output terminals, but there will be a lower voltage at the input terminals of the load.\n\nWhen this might cause a problem, remote sense can be used to force the power supply to counteract the voltage drop by raising the voltage at its output terminals. If successful, it will exactly cancel the drop along the leads, yielding the correct voltage at the input terminals of the load. This is accomplished by using separate \"sense leads,\" connected to the load's input terminals, to measure the output voltage. (Because the sensing function draws only a very small amount of current, there is practically no additional voltage drop due to the sense leads themselves.) This is the same principle behind 4-wire sensing, the generic equivalent to power supply remote sensing.\n\nMany power supplies that are equipped with remote sense can cause catastrophic damage to the loads if they are turned on while the sense leads are unconnected. To avoid this, some supplies are equipped with auto sense, which will automatically switch between local and remote sensing depending on whether the sense leads are correctly connected.\n\n\n"}

He is president and founder of Kynikos Associates, a New York City registered investment advisor focused on short selling. A noted art collector, he appeared on the BBC Four documentary \"The Banker's Guide to Art\".\n\nJames Steven Chanos was born in 1957 into a Greek immigrant family living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that operated a chain of dry-cleaning shops. He graduated from Wylie E. Groves High School, and received a B.A. in Economics and Political Science from Yale University in 1980.\n\nMr. Chanos lives in New York City with his four children. He is currently a lecturer in finance and a Becton Fellow at the Yale School of Management, where he teaches a class on the history of financial fraud. He is also the president of the board of trustees of The Browning School, and serves as a trustee at The Nightingale-Bamford School and The New-York Historical Society.\n\nChanos began his career at brokerage firm Gilford Securities in 1982. While at Gilford, he performed a cash-flow analysis and made a sell recommendation that ultimately exposed Baldwin-United, which filed for bankruptcy in 1983. Shortly thereafter, Chanos was recruited to Deutsche Bank, where he analyzed Michael Milken’s junk bonds and Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n\nAfter working as an analyst in several firms, Chanos founded Kynikos (Greek for \"cynic\") in 1985 with $16 million, as a firm specializing in short selling. A critical position taken at Kynikos was his shorting of Enron.\n\nHe describes his investment strategy as \"intensive research into stocks\", looking for fundamental failures in market valuation, from underestimated or unreported failings in the business or the market of a particular stock, followed by a substantial short position which he is willing to hold for quite a long time — perhaps an opposite echo to Warren Buffett's reputed \"fundamentals+long stay\" investment strategy. Some have said his commitment serves as more of a whistle-blower than most speculations, as in his heavy selling of such companies as Baldwin-United and Enron Corporation short.\n\nChanos was a short seller of Enron throughout 2001, increasing his short position as more information surfaced. Kynikos profited from the trade. He gained notability as a short seller when he predicted the fall of Enron Corp. before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001.\n\nChanos is a long-time skeptic of the future of the Chinese economy. He became bearish after starting to study China in earnest in the summer of 2009. In September 2009 he went public with his pessimistic outlook on China. On CNBC Chanos said the Chinese miracle economy was \"getting harder and harder to believe\", predicting the country would head the way of the \"old Soviet Union\". In January 2010, the \"New York Times\" referenced Chanos making a prediction of an impending Chinese economic crash that would resemble \"Dubai times 1,000 — or worse\". Later on the Charlie Rose Show in April 2010 he maintained that China was on a \"treadmill to hell\" that would result in a crash caused by a \"world class\" property bubble.\n\nThe Chinese real estate crash predicted in 2010 did not materialize and has caused financial media to question his investment wisdom. \"Bloomberg\" in a December 2017 article noted \"Chanos has made wayward bets against U.S. stocks and China recently\". The \"Financial Times\" in an October 2017 article used his \"Dubai times 1,000\" quote an example of one of the \"dire prophecies\" about China’s real estate market that did not come true, demonstrating the subject was \"tricky for foreign investors and experts to grasp\".\n\nChanos has pulled back on going short on China since his initial predictions. In an interview during a forum event hosted by Schechter Wealth in December 2017, he said \"in the past few years we're actually now [have] reduced our China short and our global fund to the lowest it's been\".\n\nChanos took and closed a short position on Luckin Coffee Inc. in 2020 on the advice of fellow short-seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters Research. The stock dropped 70% in April 2020 after the company disclosed in a securities filing that its chief operating officer had fabricated 2019 sales by about 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million). Chanos remarked on CNBC: “How many times do investors have to be burned in these companies that are just too good to be true? Growing 40% to 50% a year, with all kinds of odd transactions with affiliates.”\n\n"}

Leads are used for many purposes, including: transfer of power; testing of an electrical circuit to see if it is working, using a test light or a multimeter; transmitting information, as when the leads from an electrocardiograph are attached to a person's body to transmit information about their heart rhythm; and sometimes to act as a heatsink. The tiny leads coming off through-hole electronic components are also often called \"pins\"; in ball grid array packages, they are in form of small spheres, and are therefore called \"balls\".\n\nMany electrical components such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors have only two leads, while some integrated circuits can have several hundred or even more than a thousand for the largest ball grid array packages. Integrated circuit pins often either bend under the package body like a letter \"J\" (J-lead) or come out, down, and form a flat foot for securing to the board (S-lead or gull-lead). \nMost kinds of integrated circuit packaging are made by placing a silicon chip on a lead frame, wire bonding the chip to the metal leads of the lead frame, and covering the chip with plastic. The metal leads protruding from the plastic are then either \"cut long\" and bent to form through-hole pins, or \"cut short\" and bent to form surface-mount leads. Such lead frames are used for surface mount packages with leads – such as Small Outline Integrated Circuit Quad Flat Package  – and for through-hole packages such as dual in-line package  – and even for so-called \"leadless\" or \"nolead\" packages – such as Quad Flat Noleads package.\n\nThe lead frame (and therefore the pins, if any, formed from that lead frame) are occasionally made from Invar or similar alloys, due to their low coefficient of thermal expansion.\n\nFor many circuit designs it can be assumed that the leads do not contribute to the electrical effects of individual components. However, this assumption begins to break down at higher frequencies and at very small scales. These effects come from the physical construction of the leads. The leads are often metal connections that run from the rest of the circuit to the materials that each component is made of. This design results in a very small capacitance between the ends of the leads where they connect to the device and very small inductances and resistances along each lead. Because the impedance of each component is a function of the frequency of the signals being passed through the device and the inductance and capacitance of the device the leads can cause substantial variation in the properties of components in radio frequency circuits.\n\n"}

The word is a compound of ' \"thousand\" and ' \"name\". A Sahasranāma often includes the names of other deities, suggesting henotheistic equivalence and/or that they may be attributes rather than personal names. Thus the Ganesha Sahasranama list of one thousand names includes Brahma, Vishnu, Shakti, Shiva, Rudra, SadaShiva and others. It also includes epithets such as Jiva (life force), Satya (truth), Param (highest), Jnana (knowledge) and others. The Vishnu Sahasranama includes in its list \"work\" and \"jñāna-yājna\" (offering of knowledge) as two attributes of Vishnu. The \"Lalita Sahasranama\", similarly, includes the energies of a goddess that manifest in an individual as desire, wisdom and action.\n\nA sahasranama provides a terse list of attributes, virtues and legends symbolized by a deity. There are also many shorter stotras, containing only 108 names and accordingly called \"ashtottara-shata-nāma\".\n\nThe sahasranamas such as the Vishnu Sahasranama, are not found in early Samhita manuscripts, rather found in medieval and later versions of various Samhitas.

He flew into space on board the NASA Space Shuttle missions STS-121 and STS-124 and served as a mission specialist of Expedition 28 and commander of Expedition 29 aboard the International Space Station.\n\nFossum was involved with the United States Air Force during his undergraduate years at Texas A&M and served as commander of Squadron 3 in the Corps of Cadets. He graduated in mechanical engineering in 1980. He received his master's in physical science (space science) from the University of Houston. He was selected to attend Air Force Test Pilot School from which he flew 34 different types of aircraft.\n. He left active duty for the Air Force Reserve in 1992 to work for NASA and retired as a Colonel in the USAFR in 2010.\n\nThe first time Fossum became interested in being an astronaut was at age 12 while watching the Apollo 11 moon landing. He rekindled this dream while he was assigned by the Air Force at Johnson Space Center during the early 1990s.\n\nIn January 1993, Fossum was employed by NASA as a Systems Engineer. His primary responsibilities were to evaluate the Russian Soyuz spacecraft for use as an emergency escape vehicle for the new international space station. Later in 1993, Fossum was selected to represent the Flight Crew Operations Directorate in an extensive redesign of the International Space Station (ISS). After this, he continued work for the crew office and Mission Operations Directorate in the area of assembly operations. In 1996, Fossum supported the Astronaut Office as a Technical Assistant for Space Shuttle, supporting design and management reviews. In 1997, he served as a Flight Test Engineer on the X-38, a prototype crew escape vehicle for the ISS, which was under development in house by the Engineering Directorate at NASA-JSC and flight tested at NASA Dryden.\n\nFossum was selected by NASA as an Astronaut Candidate in June 1998, having applied during almost every selection period since 1988 (7 times). He reported for training in August 1998. Fossum previously served as the Astronaut Office Lead for ISS flight software development. As a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, Fossum supported several flights, including Lead CAPCOM for ISS Expedition 6. A veteran of three space flights, STS-121 in 2006, STS-124 in 2008 and Expedition 28/29 in 2011, Fossum has logged more than 194 days in space, including more than 48 hours of Extravehicular Activity (EVA) in seven spacewalks.\n\nAfter returning to Earth in 2011, Fossum has served in a number of capacities, including assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for the International Space Station.\n\nHe entered space for the first time on July 4, 2006 as a mission specialist of mission STS-121 to the International Space Station where he participated in three spacewalks. On July 8, Fossum with Piers Sellers conducted a 7 and a half hour spacewalk making a repair to the ISS and testing using the Shuttle's arm as a platform for making repairs to the Shuttle. Fossum became the first Texas A&M undergraduate to travel to space.\n\nIn 2008, Fossum assumed the role of mission specialist on board STS-124 launching on May 31, 2008. The mission's primary objective was the delivery and installment of Japan's Kibo Laboratory module. Once attached, this module became the largest and most scientifically capable addition to the International Space Station. Fossum took part in the installation as lead spacewalker, EVA-1, accompanied by fellow spacewalker Ron Garan. They would ultimately performed three spacewalks during the 14-day mission.\n\nOn June 7, 2011 Fossum launched with crewmates Sergey Alexandrovich Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa on Soyuz TMA-02M from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, to the ISS to join the crew of Expedition 28. Upon the departure of Expedition 28, Fossum served as ISS Commander during Expedition 29 from September 9 until November 21, 2011. He returned to Earth on November 22, 2011.\nDuring Expedition 28, Fossum performed his seventh EVA with Ronald Garan which lasted 6 hours and 31 minutes. During the EVA They retrieved a failed pump module for return to Earth, installed two experiments and repaired a new base for the Canada Arm 2.\n\nIn January 2017, Fossum left NASA and accepted a position with Texas A&M University at Galveston as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nFossum is married to the former Melanie J. London and they have four children together. In his spare time he enjoys activities with his family and pastimes such as jogging and backpacking.\n\nAs an Eagle Scout, he is heavily involved with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) as well as the Order of the Arrow and is the Scoutmaster of Troop 1598 based in Webster,TX. The BSA has honored him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. On May 30, 2007, Fossum was invited to be the keynote speaker at the opening ceremony at Philmont Scout Ranch, starting off the ranch's 2007 season by relating to the staff there how his experiences both in scouting and at Philmont helped him overcome many challenges in his life.\n\nHe still keeps a close affiliation with Texas A&M University and the University's Corps of Cadets, from which he graduated in 1980. Since returning from his first mission in 2006, he has been involved in many different Texas A&M speaking events, including Elephant Walk, Aggie Muster, JCAP (Corps of Cadets), and the presentation of an Aggie flag flown on STS-121 at a Texas A&M football game. On March 6, 2010, Fossum became the youngest person inducted into the Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor. In 2011, NASA worked with the Texas A&M School of Engineering to host a live interview from the ISS between Fossum and Aggie students.\n\nA Junior High School in McAllen, Texas has been named after Fossum.\n\nFossum resides in Houston, Texas.\n\n"}
{"id": "2313050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313050", "title": "Geography of England", "text": "Geography of England\n\nEngland comprises most of the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, in addition to a number of small islands of which the largest is the Isle of Wight. England is bordered to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. It is closer to continental Europe than any other part of mainland Britain, divided from France only by a sea gap, the English Channel. The Channel Tunnel, near Folkestone, directly links England to mainland Europe. The English/French border is halfway along the tunnel.\n\nMost of England consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west. Uplands in the north include the Pennines, an upland chain dividing east and west, the Lake District, containing the highest mountains in the country, the Cheviot Hills across the Anglo-Scottish border, and the North York Moors near the North Sea. Uplands in the west include Dartmoor and Exmoor in the south west and the Shropshire Hills near Wales. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the Tees-Exe line. To the south of that line, there are larger areas of flatter land, including East Anglia and the Fens, although hilly areas include the Cotswolds, the Chilterns, and the North and South Downs.\n\nThe largest natural harbour in England is at Poole, on the south-central coast. Some regard it as the second largest harbour in the world, after Sydney, Australia, although this fact is disputed (see harbours for a list of other large natural harbours).\n\nEngland has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round, it has a more mild climate than places at similar latitudes, for example Newfoundland in Canada, or Sakhalin in Russia. The seasons are quite variable in temperature, however temperatures rarely fall below −5 °C (23 °F) or rise above 30 °C (86 °F). The prevailing wind is from the south-west, bringing mild and wet weather to England regularly from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the east and warmest in the south, which is closest to the European mainland. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, although it is not very common away from high ground.\nEngland has warmer maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the year than the other countries of the UK, though Wales has milder minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has warmer maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, totalling around 192.8 hours.\nThe highest temperature recorded in England is 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) on 10 August 2003 at Brogdale, near Faversham, in Kent. The lowest temperature recorded in England is −26.1 °C (−15.0 °F) on 10 January 1982 at Edgmond, near Shropshire.\nThe climate of south-west England is rather distinct and somewhat milder than the rest of England, forming its own separate climate. Crops, flowers and plants can be grown much earlier in the south-west than in the rest of England and the UK.\n\nEngland mainly lies within hardiness zone 8, but the Pennines and Cumbrian Mountains lie in the colder zone 7 and south west England, the Irish sea coast, South coast and London lie in the warmer zone 9. A very small area, the Isles of Scilly lie in the warmest zone in the British Isles, zone 10 which is close to Sub-Tropical.\n\nThe Geology of England is mainly sedimentary. The youngest rocks are in the south east, progressing in age in a north-westerly direction. The Tees-Exe line marks the division between younger, softer and low-lying rocks in the south east and older, harder, and generally a higher relief in the north-west. \nThe geology of England is recognisable in the landscape of its counties, for instance Cumbria, Kent and Norfolk all have very distinct and very different looks from each other.\nThe geology of Northern England and Western England tends to be somewhat closer to that of its near neighbours, Wales and Scotland, with the geology of Southern England and Eastern England being more aligned with that found across the North Sea and English Channel in Northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nGeological features:\n\nGeological resources:\n\nand less abundantly,\n\n\nLondon is, by far, the largest urban area in England and one of the largest and busiest cities in the world. Other cities, mainly in central and northern England, are of substantial size and influence. The list of England's largest cities or urban areas is open to debate because, although the normal meaning of city is \"a continuously built-up urban area\", this can be hard to define, particularly because administrative areas in England often do not correspond with the limits of urban development, and many towns and cities have, over the centuries, grown to form complex urban agglomerations. For the official definition of a UK (and therefore English) city, see \"City status in the United Kingdom\".\n\nAccording to the ONS urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 15 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):\n\nThe largest cities in England are as follows (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe extreme points of England are:\n\n\n\nEngland is generally lower and flatter than the rest of the UK, but has two main divisions in its form – the lowland areas of the south, east, and midlands and the more rugged and upland areas of the north and west.\nEast Anglia is the lowest area of England, having no high hills or mountains and hosting an area of the Fens, the lowest area of England. The highest area of England is the North West, which contains England's highest hills and mountains, including its highest – Scafell Pike.\n\nIn England, a mountain is officially defined as land over 600 metres, so most fall in Northern England. Some hill and mountain chains in England are:\n\n\nThe main English islands by area and population are:\n\nThe longest river in England is the River Severn which has its source in Wales, enters England at its confluence with the River Vyrnwy and flows into the Bristol Channel. The longest river entirely within England is the River Thames which flows through the English and British capital, London. The Vale of York and The Fens host many of England's larger rivers.\n\nEngland has of coastline, much less than the deeply indented Scottish coastline.\nThe English coastline varies a great deal by the seas and regions it borders. The North Sea coast of England is mainly flat and sandy with many dunes and is similar to coastlines across the sea in the Netherlands. \nThe English North Sea coast is an important area of bird life and is a habitat for many shore and wading birds. Along the English Channel, the South Coast builds up into steep, white cliffs at Dover, which are often seen as an iconic symbol of England and Britain.\n\nThe South Coast continues to the Isle of Wight, but eventually gives way to the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a coastline rich in beauty, history and fossils.\n\nInto Devon and Cornwall, the coastline becomes more rocky and steep, with numerous cliffs and tiny fishing villages along the coastline. This stretch of coastline stretches from Devon to Land's End in Cornwall, the westernmost part of mainland England.\nThe coastline of Devon and Cornwall has similarities to that of Brittany in France directly opposite.\n\nFollowing the coastline northwards the coast remains much the same as in south Devon and Cornwall but is besides the Celtic Sea until it eventually reaches the Bristol Channel, an important shipping and docking area.\n\nThe English coastline re-emerges again in North West England. The coastline here is similar to the North Sea coast in that it is mainly flat and sandy, with the only notable cliffs along this stretch of coast being at St Bees Head in Cumbria. The English Irish Sea coast is an important area of estuaries and bird life, with Wirral being a peninsula bounded by two rivers, the River Dee and the River Mersey. Liverpool and Merseyside are areas of high population and important industry along this coast, with tourist resorts of Southport and Blackpool being further to the north.\nThe English Irish Sea coast hosts two important geographic areas, Morecambe Bay, a large bay, and the Furness and Walney Island areas.\nFurther north into Cumbria the Sellafield Nuclear Power Station lies along this coast. The English section of the Irish Sea coast ends at the border with Scotland in the Solway Firth.\n\nSeas bordering England are:\n\n\nAlthough the largest nation within the UK, England is relatively absent of large lakes, with many of its former wetlands being drained throughout the Middle Ages. Most of its largest lakes lie within the aptly named \"Lake District\" in Cumbria, Northern England.\n\nThe total land area of England is . Crops and fallow land accounts for 30% of the land area, grasses and rough grazing 36%, other agricultural land 5%, forest and woodland 8%, and urban development 21%.\n\nEngland has two land borders: a border with Scotland that follows the Cheviot Hills and a border with Wales that loosely follows the route of Offa's Dyke. \nTo the west, the Irish Sea separates England from Ireland and the Isle of Man; to the east, the North Sea separates England from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium and to the south, the English Channel separates England from France and the Channel Islands.\n\nEngland boasts one of the largest economies in Europe and indeed the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907.\nEngland's economy is usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles in contrast to the Rhine Capitalism of Europe, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. \nThe currency in England is the pound sterling, also known as the GBP. England prints its own banknotes which are also circulated in Wales.\nThe economy of England is the largest part of the United Kingdom's economy.\n\nRegional differences:\nThe strength of the English economy varies from region to region. GDP, and GDP per capita is highest in London. Generally the Northern and Western areas of England are the poorest, with the Southern and Eastern areas being the richest.\nThe following table shows the GDP (2004) per capita of England as a whole and each of the nine regions.\n\nTwo of the are in England. Inner London is number 1 with a €71 338 GDP per capita (303% above EU average);Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Oxfordshire is number 7 with a €40 937 GDP per capita (174% above EU average).\n\nEngland, formerly a kingdom and independent country, united with Scotland to form what would eventually become the UK (Wales was treated as part of England at that time).\n\nEngland is in a unique and controversial position of being a political entity within the UK and as of 2015 having no self-governance. England is represented by MPs in the British Parliament and matters relating only to England are also dealt with by the UK parliament. England is divided into a number of regions which also send representatives to the European Parliament.\n"}

He was the son of Armand de Gontaut, baron de Biron, under whose command he fought for the royal party against the Catholic League in the later stages of the Wars of Religion in France. His efforts won him the name “Thunderbolt of France” (). Henry IV made him admiral of France in 1592, and marshal in 1594. As governor of Burgundy in 1595, he took the towns of Beaune, Autun, Auxonne and Dijon, and distinguished himself at the battle of Fontaine-Française. In 1596 he was sent to fight the Spaniards in Flanders, Picardy, Artois and finally at the Siege of Amiens where he funded much of the King's army. \n\nAfter the peace of Vervins, he discharged a mission at Brussels in 1598. From that time, he was engaged in intrigues with Spain and Savoy aiming at the overthrow of the Bourbon dynasty, the dismemberment of the kingdom of France into provincial states, and his own elevation as sovereign of Burgundy. Notwithstanding these intrigues, he directed the expedition sent against the duke of Savoy (1599–1600). He fulfilled diplomatic missions for Henry in Switzerland (1600) and England (1601), the latter mission being to announce the marriage of Henry to Maria de' Medici.\n\nWhile engaged in these duties, he was accused and convicted in his absence of high treason by the French Parlement. He was induced to come to Paris, where he was apprehended and then beheaded in the Bastille on 31 July 1602.\n\nHe was the inspiration behind the character Berowne in William Shakespeare's \"Love's Labour's Lost\", which was written during his lifetime. After his death, his tragic fate was dramatised by George Chapman in \"The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron\" (1608, republished in 1625 and 1653).\n\nBiron was also the subject of the song La Complainte Du Maréchal Biron by the Canadian folk rock group Garolou. The lyrics to the song change the story significantly, having him accused of treason for having an affair with the Queen. He begs the King for his life, reminding him that he saved his life three times. But the King is unmoved by his plea.\n\n"}

Born in Washington, D.C., she was selected by NASA in 1996 and qualified as a mission specialist in robotics. Nowak flew aboard during the STS-121 mission in July 2006, where she was responsible for operating the robotic arms of the shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\nOn February 5, 2007, she was arrested in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently charged with the attempted kidnapping of U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who was romantically involved with astronaut William Oefelein. Nowak was released on bail, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to the space agency as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery.\n\nNowak remained a Navy captain until August 2010, when a naval board of inquiry, composed of three admirals, voted unanimously to reduce Nowak in rank to commander and to discharge her from the Navy under other than honorable conditions.\n\nLisa Nowak is the daughter of Alfredo and Jane Caputo of Rockville, Maryland.\n\nIn 1969, as a six-year-old watching the Apollo moon landings, Nowak first became interested in the space program. While growing up, she continued to follow the Space Shuttle program, particularly the introduction of female astronauts.\n\nIn 1981, Nowak graduated from Charles W. Woodward High School in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nIn 1985, Nowak received her Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy.\n\nIn 1992, Nowak earned both a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\n\nIn 1985, Nowak received her commission in the United States Navy.\n\nIn 1987, Nowak became a Naval Flight Officer via the Tactical Navigation syllabus at Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Nowak was then assigned to Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at NAS Point Mugu, California, where she flew both the EA-7L and ERA-3B aircraft, supporting the U.S. Pacific Fleet in small and large-scale exercises with jamming and missile profiles.\n\nIn 1993, Nowak was selected for transfer to the Restricted Line as an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, and to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.\n\nAfter graduating from the Naval Postgraduate School, Nowak stayed at Patuxent River working as an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron, flying in the F/A-18 and EA-6B. She was then assigned to the Naval Air Systems Command, working on acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft, when she was selected for the astronaut program.\n\nNowak logged over 1,500 hours of flight in over 30 different aircraft during her career in the Navy.\n\nWhile in the Navy, Nowak was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, and other service awards.\n\nOn 20 August 2010, after a review of the circumstances of the legal case, a panel of three U.S. Navy admirals recommended that she be discharged from the Navy and her rank reduced from Captain to Commander. Her service was classified as \"other than honorable\".\n\nNowak was selected to be an astronaut in 1996 and entered the NASA Astronaut Corps at Johnson Space Center in August of that year. She qualified as a mission specialist in robotics, and was assigned to a future mission designated STS-118. After schedule changes, she instead went into space on July 4, 2006, as a member of the STS-121 crew assigned to the International Space Station. Nowak served as mission flight engineer, operated the Shuttle's robotic arm during several spacewalks, and logged almost 13 days in space. For her work as a member of the crew of STS-121, NASA announced on May 30, 2007, Nowak's selection to receive the NASA Space Flight Medal at Johnson Space Center on June 5, 2007.\n\nOn February 6, 2007, following an arrest in Florida for attempted kidnapping, Nowak was placed on 30-day leave by NASA. She returned to Houston, Texas, on a commercial airline flight the next day and upon arrival was reportedly taken immediately under police escort to the Johnson Space Center for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Nowak's assignment to NASA as a serving Navy officer was terminated by the space agency on March 7, 2007.\n\nNowak remained on active duty with the Navy and was subsequently ordered to work on the staff of the chief of Naval Air Training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy.\n\nNaval officials waited for her kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her. Military law experts have stated that, while the Navy rarely brings charges against officers for adultery, it is seen as conduct unbecoming an officer, as it demonstrates bad judgment.\n\nIn 2017, at the age of 54, Nowak was reported to be living in Texas and working in the \"private sector\". Her attorney stated: \"She's doing well.\"\n\nNowak married Richard T. Nowak, a classmate at both the U.S. Naval Academy and naval flight school, in 1988. Richard Nowak was employed by a contractor to NASA at Johnson Space Center while concurrently continuing to fly for the Navy as an officer in the Naval Air Reserve. The Nowaks have three children, a son born in 1992 and twin daughters born in 2001. A statement from the family indicated that the Nowaks separated in January 2007 and subsequently divorced.\n\nImmediately following William Oefelein's divorce, he and Lisa Nowak became involved with each other. Their affair lasted two years, with Oefelein beginning to break it off gradually near the end of 2006. It was during this time that Oefelein started a relationship with Colleen Shipman, who was working as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.\n\nNowak drove from Houston to Orlando, Florida, on February 4–5, 2007. She packed latex gloves, a black wig, a BB pistol and ammunition, pepper spray, a hooded tan trench coat, a drilling hammer, black gloves, rubber tubing, plastic garbage bags, approximately $585 in cash, her computer, an Gerber folding knife and several other items before driving the to Florida. Early police reports indicated she wore Maximum Absorbency Garments during the trip, but she later denied wearing them. On February 5, 2007, Nowak went to the Orlando International Airport, waited for about an hour in the baggage claim, and then proceeded to the airport parking lot, where she located and confronted Colleen Shipman, who had just arrived from Houston by plane.\n\nShipman said that after arriving, she was aware of someone following her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being \"more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship\". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.\n\nTwo fellow astronauts traveled to Florida for Nowak's arraignment to assist authorities and NASA personnel as needed: Captain Christopher Ferguson, the senior active duty Naval Officer in the NASA Astronaut Corps at the time, went as Nowak's commanding officer, and retired Air Force Colonel Steven Lindsey, who was the commander of Nowak's shuttle mission, STS-121, went as Chief of the Astronaut Office, the senior astronaut at NASA. On February 6, 2007, both appeared before a judge on her behalf. The state's attorney argued that the facts indicated a well thought out plan to kidnap and perhaps to injure Shipman. While arguing for pre-trial release Nowak's attorney remarked, \"One's good works must count for something\". Nowak was ordered released on $15,500 bail under the condition she wear a GPS tracking device and not contact Shipman; however, before Nowak could be released, Orlando police charged Nowak with attempted first-degree murder and announced she would not be released on bail. Her lawyer alleged that police and prosecutors, unhappy that Nowak had been granted bail, pressed more serious charges solely to keep her confined to jail. In the second arraignment Nowak was charged with attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, for which the judge raised bail by $10,000. After posting bail, Nowak was released from jail. Shipman dropped her request for a protection order on February 15.\n\nThere was widespread reaction to Nowak's arrest with concerns expressed about NASA's astronaut selection and screening process and planned 30-month missions to Mars. Some indicated that NASA's presentation of astronauts as heroes is part of the problem because of the social pressure. Some perceived her treatment in the criminal process as lenient. Others have been shocked that her criminal behavior has been the subject of parody.\n\nNASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin commissioned the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, an independent panel, to examine how well NASA attended to the mental health of its astronauts. The initial report released by the panel raised questions in regards to possible alcohol use prior to flight. The report, however, offered no specifics, no facts to substantiate the claims, and stated that no attempt to confirm or investigate the allegations had been performed.\n\nShuttle Commander Scott Kelly was vocal in his criticism of the report during interviews prior to STS-118, stating it was beyond his comprehension that astronauts would ever consider what was suggested. Following the release of the independent panel report, NASA ordered an internal review, the Space Flight Safety Review.\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer Bryan O'Connor reported that after the month-long review, NASA found there was no evidence to verify the independent panel's report that astronauts have been allowed to fly drunk. Additionally, investigation into all incident reports dating from 1984 to 2007, found no incident involving alcohol or drug use. The report's findings specifically stated:\n\nIn response to the internal review, policies at NASA would be changed in a variety of ways: flight surgeons would be present during the pre-mission suit-up activities, flight surgeons would receive additional training in psychiatric evaluation, and although there was an unofficial code of conduct in place, an official \"Code of Conduct\" would be written up for employees.\n\nOn April 10, 2007, Florida prosecutors released additional material in the case. The previous week, the trial judge had agreed to unseal some of the documents that described items found in Nowak's car after her arrest. Among these items were a handwritten note on stationery listing Shipman's flight information and \"Flight Controller's Log\" paper with a handwritten list of more than 24 items, including sneakers, plastic gloves, contacts, cash, an umbrella, and black sweats. A floppy disk contained two photographs of Nowak riding in a bicycle race, and 15 images depicting an unidentified woman in different stages of undress. An evidence report dated March 15 indicated that nearly all of the photographs and drawings depicted scenes of bondage. Also found were $585.00 (USD) and £41.00 (GBP) in cash and 4 brown paper bags with 69 orange pills that were not publicly identified. Investigators also examined two USB drives found in the car. They contained family pictures, digital movies, and NASA-related materials. Investigators concluded that the information on the disk and USB drives did not have any direct relationship to the alleged kidnapping attempt.\n\nOefelein reportedly provided Nowak with a cell phone to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least 12 times, and sent 7 text messages the day after he returned from his shuttle flight on December 22 that he did not retrieve until December 24, when they had a 7-minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were recorded, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had broken off the relationship with Nowak. He did, however, have her to lunch in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for a bicycle race, and they also went to the gym together.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, authorities released a surveillance video from the Orlando International Airport terminal purporting to show Nowak waiting for nearly an hour, standing near the baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and later following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.\n\nOn February 13, 2007, Nowak pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: (1) attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize, (2) burglary of a conveyance with a weapon, and (3) battery. The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. Nowak formally entered a plea of not guilty to the kidnapping charges on March 22 at an arraignment hearing although she was not present in person. Nowak's attorney, who filed the plea with the Orange County court, requested a jury trial. The trial was originally due to commence on July 30, 2007, but was postponed until April 7, 2008, to allow the prosecution time to prepare for an anticipated insanity defense. On January 16, 2008, a judge postponed the trial, as well as the pre-trial hearing to be held on March 12, 2008, indefinitely, pending the outcome of the state's appeal of an earlier decision to suppress evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.\n\nA pre-trial hearing was held on July 17, 2007, and further hearings were to be held on September 19, to argue defense motions to suppress some of the evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.<ref name=\"Florida Today 4/9\"></ref> On August 12, 2007, Nowak asked to have her GPS ankle bracelet removed, which the judge agreed to on August 30. On August 28, the trial judge unsealed a court document indicating that Nowak intended to pursue an insanity defense. According to documents submitted by her lawyer, Nowak was evaluated by two psychiatrists who diagnosed her with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, Asperger syndrome, a single episode of major depressive disorder and a \"brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors\" at the time of the incident. On November 2, 2007, the trial judge suppressed Nowak's initial (pre-Miranda) statements to police, as well as all evidence found in her vehicle, citing police misconduct in their initial search and questioning. The prosecution appealed that ruling on November 8. A hearing on that appeal occurred on October 21, 2008.\n\nOn December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal held that her statements were taken in violation of her \"Miranda\" rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably found it in the normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.\n\nOn May 15, 2009, it was reported that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case. On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial began. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to felony burglary and misdemeanor battery. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.\n\nOn August 19, 2010, a Naval administrative panel of three admirals voted to recommend Nowak be separated from the U.S. Navy with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and that her rank be reduced from Captain to Commander. The panel's recommendation would be reviewed by the Naval Personnel Command and would ultimately be determined by the Secretary of the Navy.\n\nIn March 2011, Nowak petitioned the court to seal the record of her criminal proceedings, citing harm to her family and their livelihood. The motion was granted. On July 28, 2011, Assistant Secretary of Navy Juan M. Garcia III said in a statement that Nowak would retire with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and her pay grade would be reduced one rank.\n\nParts of Nowak's story—including a love triangle amongst astronauts and the reported wearing of adult diapers during a long-distance drive—inspired the 2007 \"\" episode \"Rocket Man\".\n\nThe 2008 Molly Lewis song \"Road Trip\" recounts the details of early news reports about Nowak's trip from Houston to Orlando.\n\nThe Ben Folds song \"Cologne\" from his 2008 album Way to Normal references Nowak's tabloid coverage where she \"put on a pair of diapers to kill her boyfriend.\"\n\nNowak's state of mind during the incident was the subject of a play, \"Starcrosser's Cut\", which opened in Los Angeles in June 2013.\n\nIn the 2017 film \"Rough Night\", the male protagonist Peter is recommended by his friends to enact the \"Sad Astronaut\", clearly referencing Nowak's road journey from Houston to Orlando, Florida. A specific element of Nowak's journey (wearing of the adult diapers, which Nowak has since denied), is a plot point utilized in the movie, that has been cited as one of the film's most defining moments.\n\nThe 2019 film \"Lucy in the Sky\" starring Natalie Portman is loosely based on Nowak's experiences.\n\n\n"}

Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Joan Sims also appear. It was produced and directed by Mario Zampi and written by Michael Pertwee. It was released in the U.S. as Your Past is Showing.\n\nNigel Dennis (Dennis Price) is a blackmailer who threatens to publish embarrassing secrets in his magazine \"The Naked Truth\". After attempting to blackmail a famous scientist (who commits suicide), and an MP (who suffers a heart attack in parliament, and probably succumbs), his latest targets are Lord Henry Mayley (Terry-Thomas), television host Sonny MacGregor (Peter Sellers), writer Flora Ransom (Peggy Mount), and model Melissa Right (Shirley Eaton).\nSeveral of them decide independently that murder would be a better solution than paying. However, it is Mayley who by sheer bad luck nearly ends up the victim of both MacGregor and Ransom's schemes. The four eventually join forces and try again. That attempt also fails, but Dennis is then arrested for an earlier crime.\n\nWhen Dennis threatens to reveal all at his trial, Mayley comes up with a scheme to break him out of prison and send him to South America, with the help of hundreds of his other victims. They phone in numerous fake calls for help, distracting the London police, while Mayley, MacGregor, and MacGregor's reluctant assistant Porter (Kenneth Griffith), disguised as policemen, whisk Dennis away.\nKnocking Dennis unconscious periodically, they finally end up in the cabin of a blimp on the way to a rendezvous with an outbound ship. To their dismay, when he comes to, Dennis refuses to go along with their plan, as he in fact never wanted to reveal any of their secrets in court. He was, in fact, optimistic about the trial anyway, and reveals that the evidence was his copies of \"The Naked Truth\" which had been destroyed by the plotters earlier. Happy to have outsmarted his opponents again, but unaware of where he is, Dennis then steps out for some air and plummets to the ocean below. When MacGregor celebrates by shooting his pistol, it punctures the blimp, which shoots away into the distance.\n\n\nAllmovie wrote, \"A prescient satire of tabloid journalists and celebrity culture, The Naked Truth, is a well-acted British comedy that doesn't quite succeed in melding its black and broad comedy\"; whereas \"Radio Times\" wrote, \"This black comedy supplied Peter Sellers with some of his funniest, and finest, pre-Hollywood material. It's based - as the best British humour often is - on class and sex...Mario Zampi directs the gags in Michael Pertwee's satisfying script with superb timing.\" and Leonard Maltin noted, \"Sellers (cast as a television star) is a special treat in this amusing satire.\"\n\n"}

She flew to space onboard three Space Shuttle missions, and is the second African American woman to go into space, after Mae Jemison. Her 42 days in space are the most of any African American astronaut, male or female.\n\nStephanie Wilson was born in Boston, Massachusetts on September 27, 1966. About a year later, her parents, Eugene and Barbara Wilson, decided to move to Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Eugene, a native of Nesmith, South Carolina, used his electronics training from his time in the Navy to get himself a degree from Northeastern University and a long career in electrical engineering for Raytheon, Sprague Electric, and Lockheed Martin, while Barbara, from Talbot County, Georgia, worked as a production assistant for Lockheed Martin. After attending Stearns Elementary School, she attended Crosby Junior High School. For a career awareness class in middle school, Wilson was assigned to interview someone in a field that interested her. Since she liked to look up at the sky, she interviewed Williams College astronomer Jay Pasachoff, clarifying her potential career interest in space. In high school, Eugene encouraged Stephanie to go into engineering, so she decided to become an aerospace engineer. Wilson graduated from Taconic High School, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1984. She attended Harvard University, receiving a bachelor of science degree in engineering science in 1988. Wilson earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas, in 1992. Wilson has returned to Harvard as a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers. She was the Chief Marshal for the 362nd Harvard Commencement on May 30, 2013.\n\nWilson worked for two years for the former Martin Marietta Astronautics Group in Denver, Colorado. As a Loads and Dynamics engineer for the Titan IV rocket, Wilson was responsible for performing coupled loads analyses for the launch vehicle and payloads during flight events. Wilson left Martin Marietta in 1990 to attend graduate school at the University of Texas. Her research focused on the control and modeling of large, flexible space structures.\n\nFollowing the completion of her graduate work, Wilson began working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in 1992. As a member of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem for the Galileo spacecraft, Wilson was responsible for assessing attitude controller performance, science platform pointing accuracy, antenna pointing accuracy, and spin rate accuracy. She worked in the areas of sequence development and testing as well. While at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Wilson also supported the Interferometery Technology Program as a member of the Integrated Modeling Team, which was responsible for finite element modeling, controller design, and software development.\n\nSelected by NASA as an Astronaut Candidate in April 1996, Wilson reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, she is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. She was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch to work with Space Station payload displays and procedures. She then served in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch, working in Mission Control as a prime communicator with on-orbit crews. Following her work in Mission Control, Wilson was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch involving the Space Shuttle Main Engines, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters.\n\nStephanie has flown on three shuttle missions. On STS-121, Wilson flew aboard as a mission specialist. She also flew on the STS-120 mission that delivered the Harmony connecting module to the International Space Station. In April 2010, Wilson flew as a Mission Specialist on STS-131.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, Wilson was ground controller at Houston for the first all woman spacewalk by Christina Koch and Jessica Meir \n\nSTS-121 (July 4–17, 2006), was a return-to-flight test mission and assembly flight to the International Space Station. During the 13-day flight the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery tested new equipment and procedures that increase the safety of space shuttles, repaired a rail car on the International Space Station and produced never-before-seen, high-resolution images of the Shuttle during and after its July 4 launch. Wilson supported robotic arm operations for vehicle inspection, Multi-Purpose Logistics Module installation and EVAs and was responsible for the transfer of more than 28,000 pounds of supplies and equipment to the ISS. The crew also performed maintenance on the space station and delivered a new Expedition 13 crew member to the station. The mission was accomplished in 306 hours, 37 minutes and 54 seconds.\n\nSTS-120 (October 23 – November 7, 2007) was a 6.25 million mile Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It delivered the \"Harmony\" module, and reconfigured the P6 truss in preparation for future assembly missions. STS-120 carried a new Expedition 16 crewmember, Daniel Tani, and returned Expedition 15 and Expedition 16 crewmember Clayton Anderson. The crew conducted four spacewalks and performed a previously untested repair method on the station's solar array. The mission was accomplished in 15 days, 2 hours, 23 minutes, during 238 orbits.\n\nSTS-131 (April 5–20, 2010) was a resupply mission to the International Space Station. Space Shuttle Discovery was launched pre-dawn from Kennedy Space Center. Once docked to the space station, the crew delivered more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies, experiments and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant that required three spacewalks and robotics to install, new crew sleeping quarters, a window observation facility and a freezer for experiments. During the mission, Wilson was responsible for robotics for spacewalking support using the space station robotic arm and for robotic removal of the \"Leonardo\" Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the payload bay of Discovery. For the return to Earth, Wilson robotically installed Leonardo, which was packed with more than 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results and used supplies, inside Discovery's payload bay. The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 2 hours, 47 minutes and 10 seconds and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 orbits.\n\nWilson is a Christian. Her hobbies include skiing and stamp collecting. She is married to Julius McCurdy. \n\n\n"}

Anderson (July 28, 1934 – August 8, 2011) was founder and chairman of Interface Inc., one of the world's largest manufacturers of modular carpet for commercial and residential applications and a leading producer of commercial broadloom and commercial fabrics. He was known in environmental circles for his advanced and progressive stance on industrial ecology and sustainability.\n\nAnderson died on August 8, 2011, twenty months after being diagnosed with cancer.\nOn July 28, 2012, Anderson's family re-launched the Ray C. Anderson Foundation. with a new purpose.\n\nOriginally created to fund Ray Anderson's personal philanthropic giving, family members announced the rebirth and refocus of the Foundation on Anderson's birthday, nearly one year after his 2011 death. The purpose of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation is to perpetuate shared values and continue the legacy that Anderson left behind. The Ray C. Anderson Foundation is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization whose mission is to promote and advance the concepts of sustainable production and consumption.\n\nAnderson was an honors graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology in the school of industrial and systems engineering in 1956. He learned the carpet trade through more than 14 years at Deering, Milliken & Company and Callaway Mills.\n\nAnderson founded Interface in 1973 to produce the first free-lay carpet tiles in America. Interface is one of the world's largest producers of modular commercial floorcoverings, with sales in 110 countries and manufacturing facilities on four continents.\n\nAnderson first turned his focus toward the environment in 1994 when he read \"The Ecology of Commerce\" by Paul Hawken, and also \"Ishmael\" by Daniel Quinn, seeking inspiration for a speech to an internal task force on the company's environmental vision. Hawken argues that the industrial system is destroying the planet and only industry leaders are powerful enough to stop it.\n\nIn 2009, Anderson estimated that Interface was more than halfway towards the vision of “Mission Zero,” the company's promise to eliminate any negative impact it may have on the environment by the year 2020 through the redesign of processes and products, the pioneering of new technologies, and efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and harmful emissions while increasing the use of renewable materials and sources of energy.\n\nAnderson chronicled the Mission Zero journey in two books, \"Mid-Course Correction: Toward a Sustainable Enterprise: The Interface Model\" (1998) and \"Confessions of a Radical Industrialist: Profits, People, Purpose: Doing Business by Respecting the Earth\" (2009). The latter was released in paperback as \"Business Lessons from a Radical Industrialist\" in 2011.\n\nAnderson was featured several documentaries and films, such as \"The Corporation\", (2004 Canadian documentary); \"The 11th Hour\" (2007 Leonardo DiCaprio film); \"I Am\" (2011 Tom Shadyac documentary); \"Big Ideas for a Small Planet\" (Sundance Channel series); and others.\n\nThe Interface story is the focus of the documentary film “So Right, So Smart” (2009).\n\nRay served a stint as co-chair of the President's Council on Sustainable Development during President Clinton's administration, which led to him co-chairing the Presidential Climate Action Plan in 2008, a team that presented the Obama Administration with a 100-day action plan on climate. Together, he and Interface funded the creation of the Anderson-Interface Chair in Natural Systems at Georgia Tech, where Associate Professor Valerie Thomas conducts research in sustainability.\n\nRay Anderson received a host of accolades throughout his life, including:\n\n\nUnder Anderson's leadership, Interface was named to CRO magazine's (formerly Business Ethics magazine) 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for three years. In 2006, Sustainablebusiness.com named Interface to their SB20 list of Companies Changing the World, and in 2006 GlobeScan listed Interface #1 in the world for corporate sustainability.\n\nAnderson was former Board Chair for The Georgia Conservancy and served on the boards of the Ida Cason Callaway Foundation, Rocky Mountain Institute, the David Suzuki Foundation, Emory University Board of Ethics Advisory Council, the ASID Foundation, Worldwatch Institute, and the Arizona State University Global Institute of Sustainability Advisory Board. He was on the Advisory Boards of the Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment and the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper.\n\nHe was awarded 12 honorary doctorates from Northland College (public service), LaGrange College (business), N.C. State University (humane letters), University of Southern Maine (humane letters), The University of the South (civil law), and Colby College (law), Kendall College of Art and Design (art), Emory University (science), Central College in Pella, Iowa, (humane letters), Chapman University (humane letters), Clarkson University (science), and the Georgia Institute of Technology (philosophy).\n\nAnderson's papers were donated to the Georgia Historical Society by the Ray C. Anderson Foundation and Interface, Inc. in late 2015.

{"id": "2313072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313072", "title": "Sylvia Lim", "text": "Sylvia Lim\n\nSylvia Lim Swee Lian (; born 28 March 1965) is a Singaporean politician, criminal lawyer and academic.\n\nShe is currently the Chairperson of the Workers' Party of Singapore and an elected Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (Aljunied GRC) for the division of Serangoon. Lim previously served in the Singapore Police Force and subsequently joined Temasek Polytechnic as a law lecturer.\n\nLim re-entered the legal sector following the 2011 general election. She is currently senior associate in Peter Low LLC, helmed by former Law Society president Peter Low.\n\nLim had her early education at CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel, CHIJ St Joseph's Convent and National Junior College. She then read law at the National University of Singapore (NUS), graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) in 1988. She obtained a Master of Laws from the University of London (University College London) in 1989, and was called to the Bar in Singapore in 1991. She later obtained an online master's in criminal justice from the Michigan State University in 2014.\n\nDuring her undergraduate and postgraduate studies, Lim did volunteer work with the Spastic Children's Association, Salvation Army Home for the Aged and University College Hospital. She later did voluntary editorial work for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme of the Law Society of Singapore.\n\nIn 1991, Lim joined the Singapore Police Force for three years as a police inspector. She initially did investigation work at the Central Police Division Headquarters, and then became a staff officer under the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).\n\nLim joined the law firm M/s Lim & Lim in 1994. She handled litigation work both civil and criminal cases in the High Court, Subordinate Courts and Juvenile Court between 1994 and 1998.\n\nLim joined Temasek Polytechnic in 1998 as a law lecturer. She was also the Manager of Professional Development and Manager of Continuing Education and Training at the polytechnic's School of Business. Her main areas of teaching and research were in civil and criminal procedure, criminal justice and private security. During her time at Temasek Polytechnic, Lim contributed to the volume on Criminal Procedure for Halsbury's \"Laws of Singapore\" (2003), a legal practitioners' reference series, and has also collected and published primary research on private security in Singapore. \n\nIn March 2006, Temasek Polytechnic modified its staffing policies to enable Lim to run as a candidate in the general election without having to resign her teaching position at the institution.\n\nLim was cited as feeling \"distressed\" that opposition parties could contest only one-third of the parliamentary seats during the 2001 general election. 10 days after the election, she joined the Workers' Party (WP) and within 18 months quickly rose to become the Chairman of the party in 2003.\n\nAt the 2006 general election, Lim led the WP team to contest the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (Aljunied GRC), campaigning on the slogan \"You have a Choice\". Means testing in hospitals, as well as the James Gomez fiasco became hot button issues during the election campaign.\n\nThe WP team ultimately lost to the team from the governing People's Action Party (PAP) by 58,593 votes (43.9%) to 74,843 (56.1%). This was the highest percentage of the vote garnered by any losing opposition candidates in the election, and therefore meant that the WP was entitled to select one of its team members from Aljunied GRC to become a Non-constituency Member of Parliament. The party chose Lim to become its Non-constituency Member of Parliament.\n\nDuring her term in Parliament, Lim spoke out against ministers' salaries, and also against means testing in hospitals, which resulted in the PAP deferring a decision on this for a period of two years from 2006 to 2008. In addition, she also called for a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax, arguing that it was a regressive tax, and urged the government to do more to help retrenched workers.\n\nIn 2009, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.\n\nIn 2010, Lim mooted the idea that the proportion of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.\n\nLim expressed concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 that would allow magistrates to hear what are called \"first mentions\" through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that they were allowed to complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and will be able to see what is happening in the entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.\n\nThe following month, during parliamentary debates on major revisions to the Criminal Procedure Code, Lim suggested there was a need to improve pre-trial disclosure procedures and to ensure that victims of crimes received redress. Further, she expressed concerns over the leniency of community-based sentencing. The bill eventually incorporated several of her suggestions.\n\nIn 2011, Lim noted that the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all children have the opportunity to receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.\n\nIn the 2011 general election, Lim again contested in Aljunied GRC, along with Muhamad Faisal Manap, Pritam Singh, Chen Show Mao and party leader Low Thia Khiang, who vacated his seat of Hougang to lead the charge in Aljunied. Lim and her party campaigned on the slogan \"Towards a First World Parliament\", which entailed maintaining checks and balances in Parliament to keep the ruling party accountable to the public, and for opposition parties to gain experience in policy formulation and constituency work. In her final election rally speech, Lim emphasised that contrary to the public's perception, there was \"no glamour\" in being an opposition MP, and that she was only \"fighting to serve\". In a televised political broadcast on cooling-off day, Lim warned the public that \"there is a very real danger of an 87 to nil score ... and if that happens, Singapore's political landscape will suffer a tremendous setback from which we may never recover.\"\n\nLim was returned as an elected Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC after her team won 54.71% of the votes (54.72% including overseas votes), the first time that an opposition party won a GRC since the system's introduction on 1 June 1988. In addition, the defeat of the incumbent PAP team marked the first time in Singapore's electoral history that a serving cabinet minister lost his seat.\n\nShe has been assigned to look after the Serangoon ward previously held by the PAP's Lim Hwee Hua and has also been appointed Chairman of the combined Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Lim's victory also made her the first female opposition MP in Singapore's post-independence history.\n\nOne week after the election, she announced that she would be resigning from her lecturing job at Temasek Polytechnic after 12 years of service. She said that her political activities had already led to her having to take significant time off from her teaching duties in the past, and that she did not think it would be fair to the polytechnic if she stayed on as she anticipated future Parliamentary duties would take up even more of her time. Since then she has returned to the legal profession and is now a senior associate taking on legal cases on an ad-hoc basis at Peter Low LLC.\n\nIn her maiden speech as an opposition MP in October 2011, Lim urged the government to adopt a more holistic approach in assessing the well-being of Singaporeans, which included using Gross National Happiness (GNH) as an indicator apart from conventional indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Lim further noted in her speech that Singapore was a co-sponsor of Bhutan's resolution in the United Nations entitled \"Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development\". Lim's speech drew swift rebuttals from MPs of the ruling People's Action Party, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who suggested later in 2014 that it was impractical \"to switch to a different metric - from GDP to GNH\". Lim replied that \"the search for alternative indicators other than GDP is highly relevant ... GNH is not merely about measuring an emotion. It is about measuring societal progress in a holistic way\".\n\nIn 2012, Lim engaged in a heated debate with Law Minister K Shanmugam where she questioned if the judgement published by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) with regards to the Woffles Wu speeding case had addressed public concerns on the equitability of Singapore's legal system. Wu was fined S$1,000 in June 2012 under section 81(3) of the Road Traffic Act. Lim questioned why a custodial sentence was not imposed, noting that \"aggravating factors\" such as Wu abetting someone to provide false information to the police, and that he had committed more than one offence over a prolonged period would have warranted a harsher sentence. Shanmugam insisted that the treatment of the law applied in Wu's case was in line with prior cases of a similar nature, and challenged Lim repeatedly to name \"a single case\" in which a custodial sentence was imposed on cases with such a nature.\n\nThe sharp exchange between Lim and the Minister led to WP chief Low Thia Khiang intervening to question if Shanmugam was trying to \"impose some sort of intimidation\" on Lim. The debate also led to Lim requesting the Minister to \"confirm whether he's questioning my motive in filing the question? ... Is he alleging bad faith on my part to cast aspersions on the legal system?\", to which Shanmugam replied, \"MPs should leave politics aside and look at the facts if we want to be honest and fair. It's got nothing to do with intimidation.\"\n\nLim also spoke out against the Population White Paper, contending that the government's strategy of using immigration to \"top up\" for the shortfall in Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) \"will further dilute national identity\" and place Singapore on course in requiring \"even more population injections in the future\". She added that the government's attempts to encourage childbirths have been \"half-hearted\". Lim and her party proposed a greater tradeoff between GDP growth and population numbers, as well as new initiatives to encourage TFR recovery.\n\nThe AIM saga, which involved the termination of town council IT software owned by the PAP in the event of a \"material change\" in the leadership of a town, became a much talked about issue in the lead up to the Punggol East by-election in 2013. Lim contended that a \"material change\" was taken to mean a \"change in political leadership\" as in Aljunied GRC, and questioned how the public interest was served with the presence of such a termination clause. This led to Lim filing an adjournment motion in Parliament titled \"Safeguarding the Public Interest in Town Council Management\", which she withdrew after the government announced it will conduct a review on the issue. Then Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan accused Lim of being \"self-righteous\" and \"arrogant\", in which Lim replied she \"definitely does not accept his ascription of those motives to me personally\". The WP won the by-election in Punggol East.\n\nLim opposed the Public Order Bill in the aftermath of the 2013 Little India riot, characterising the \"hasty introduction\" of the bill as a \"knee-jerk reaction\" by the government. She noted that the bill would in effect \"stigmatise Little India as a special zone requiring special legislation\" and that \"there are already sufficient powers under our laws\" with the Committee of Inquiry (COI) set to release its recommendations soon. Lim further expressed concerns with regards to newly imposed liquor control regulations, as well as policing resources and manpower required to handle such occurrences.\n\nLim also advocated for a more progressive tax system and strengthening of social safety nets to mitigate inequality, which included tweaking the income tax tiers for high income earners and fixing loopholes in the property tax measures.\n\nLim expressed support for the Pioneer Generation Package rolled out by the government in 2014, but raised concerns with regards to the MediShield Life scheme, particularly for Singaporeans who are already on private medical insurance or those living abroad.\n\nLess than a month before election day on 12 August 2015, Lim set up her Instagram account with the first post showing a photo of herself eating oyster omelette at Fengshan Hawker Centre. The accompanying caption read \"The taste of Fengshan - heavenly!\" and a cryptic hashtag \"#ReasonsToWin\". A media frenzy and large public reaction ensued, with rumours circulating that Lim was considering a move to contest the election in Fengshan SMC. Alluding to the financial problems of the WP-run Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean joined in the fray, criticising Lim for wanting to \"swallow up Fengshan\" and \"help the town council with the deficit\". Lim later replied that it was \"unfortunate\" that Teo \"does not seem to have a sense of humour\".\n\nIn the 2015 Singaporean general election, Lim defended her Aljunied GRC ward against a new PAP team led by Yeo Guat Kwang. Campaigning on the platform \"Empower Your Future\", the vote numbers came down to the wire and a recount had to be conducted as the margin was less than 2%. At 03:10 AM SST on 12 September 2015, Lim and her team was returned to Parliament with a reduced majority of 50.96%.\n\nSpeaking to the media just hours after the election results on the sidelines of a thank you parade, Lim questioned if \"voters don't want too much opposition in Parliament\". She added that the fact that all 89 seats were contested by the opposition might also have resulted in some pushback, where voters were worried \"sooner or later the PAP might be dislodged as a government\". The feel-good factor of the SG50 golden jubilee celebrations, memory of the late Lee Kuan Yew who died in the same year and the unstable economic environment were also some other factors Lim cited for the results swinging in favour of the ruling party.\n\nSingapore's 13th Parliament opened on 25 January 2016 following the elections in 2015. In her Parliamentary speech to President Tony Tan Keng Yam's addenda, Lim called for fundamental changes to Singapore's education system and how students are assessed, as well as scaling back the government's presence in non-core government functions such as in the boards of sports groups so as to allow such organisations to \"manage their own affairs\". Lim further noted that \"an exceptional nation should have a people whose DNA is being unafraid to fail\".\n\nIn a sharp exchange with Law Minister K Shanmugam which lasted seven hours, Lim and her party colleagues voiced strong objections to the Administration of Justice (Protection Bill) which deals with the law of contempt of court. Lim argued that the bill was \"being bulldozed through Parliament\" and \"unnecessarily lower[s] the threshold to what amounts to scandalising the courts\". She added that the bill provides \"draconian enforcement muscle\" to the government, with the Minister using \"a sledgehammer to kill an ant ... we are one step closer to being a police state\". Lim ended her speech as such,\n\nWhile Lim supported the Government Proceedings Act, she argued against one of the act's clauses which removes the limit to the amount of legal fees the government can be awarded if and when it goes to court. Lim expressed \"grave concerns\" about the bill, saying that the bill will give the public the impression that the government is \"using legal costs as a deterrent or prohibitive factor when it comes to litigation with the government\".\n\nSpeaking during the 2-day special Parliamentary session on the 38 Oxley Road dispute, Lim noted that allegations of abuse of power mounted on PM Lee Hsien Loong by his siblings Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling were \"serious charges\" and \"deeply troubling\". Focusing her speech on potential conflicts of interest, Lim revealed that Singapore's current Attorney-General (AG) Lucien Wong represented the PM as his personal lawyer in the dispute involving the house. The Deputy AG, Hri Kumar, was also an ex-PAP MP. Lim questioned if the leadership of the Attorney-General's Chambers had \"recused themselves in advising the Government on any decision it wishes to take on 38 Oxley Road\", and \"whether these appointments instill public confidence that the AGC will act independently in matters where the Government or Prime Minister has an interest in the outcomes\". In an ensuing debate with Senior Minister of State for Law Indranee Rajah, Lim further questioned if the Cabinet agrees that there should be \"distance between the Government and the AGC leadership\", to which Rajah disagreed and replied that \"independence of mind\" was the crucial factor.\n\nLim has opposed the elected presidency, advocating for the president to be an appointed one instead. Lim argued that a president \"elected under a PAP government might be pro-PAP and could potentially cripple a non-PAP government in its first term\". In a debate with Law Minister K Shanmugam in November 2016, Lim also disagreed on the \"dual role\" expected of the elected president - being a custodian of reserves as well as being a head of state - as this might lead to the president being faced with a confrontational situation with the government.\n\nLim has suggested since 2006 that a reversion back to the system where the president is appointed by Parliament would \"naturally take care of any concerns of minority representation and would not be regressive\". Lim further called for a national referendum for Singaporeans to decide whether the public preferred an elected or appointed president. Lim therefore voted against the constitutional amendments on the Elected Presidency Act in February 2017, which would provide for a reserved election if and when an individual from a minority race has not been president for five consecutive terms. She took issue with the government's decision to use Wee Kim Wee's presidential term as the basis of starting the count for the hiatus triggered mechanism, arguing that Wee was never elected by the people.\n\nAlluding to Lim's accusations, Minister Chan Chun Sing charged that Lim was \"casting aspersions on the integrity of the Prime Minister\", while DPM Teo Chee Hean said the decision was \"based on AGC's advice\" and asked Lim to mount a judicial challenge in the courts if she disagreed. This subsequently led to former presidential candidate and ex-PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock filing a suit in the High Court on whether the government's decision to start the count from President Wee was correct and in accordance with the constitution. Tan's case was dismissed and thrown out by the High Court and Court of Appeal, with the court ruling that it was entirely up to the government to decide when to start the count for the hiatus triggered mechanism. Lim was personally present in the Court of Appeal to hear the judgement.\n\nThe writ of election for Presidential Elections 2017 was issued soon after on 28 August 2017. On the same day, Lim filed an adjournment motion titled \"Counting from President Wee Kim Wee or President Ong Teng Cheong – policy decision or legal question?\" for the parliamentary sitting on 11 September 2017. Her adjournment motion was subsequently balloted out twice as other PAP MPs had also filed adjournment motions, rendering her unable to speak on the issue.\n\nLim delivered her speech on the adjournment motion on 3 October 2017, after two unsuccessful attempts. In a strongly-worded 18-minute speech, Lim stated on the outset that the \"public was very divided\" on the implementation of reserved presidential elections. She accused the government — particularly PM Lee, DPM Teo, and Minister Chan — of attempting to \"confuse and distract\", and misleading Parliament by \"merely using the AGC's advice as a cover to avoid full Parliamentary debate on why the count was not starting from President Ong Teng Cheong\". In his reply, Law Minister Shanmugam rejected Lim's assertions that the government was attempting to mislead, saying that the \"government has always been clear that when it comes to the counting, it is a policy matter for Parliament to decide\". He also took a swipe at Lim and berated, \"Ms Lim protests far too much.\"\n\nIn opposing the renewal of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) on 6 February 2018, Lim questioned the premature renewal of the bill and said that the government had \"gone too far\" with the additional provisions, charging that the addition of a finality clause in the act to make the Minister's decision on whether to detain someone without trial final was an “attempt to make the Minister (for Home Affairs) all-powerful”. Lim added that she found the addition of the finality clause \"very troubling\" and \"a position too arrogant for the House to adopt\".\n\nLim also took issue with the amendments to the fourth schedule, which now defines the scope of criminal activities in which one may be detained under the CLTPA. Lim branded the bill \"untenable\" and accused the Minister of attempting to be \"a global policeman with no equal in the world\" after it was revealed that individuals who commit criminal activities outside Singapore may now be detained under the CLTPA as well, as in the case of Dan Tan.\n\nA highly charged exchange between Lim and Minister Shanmugam broke out thereafter, with the Minister rebutting to say he was \"prepared to stand up here and say as the Law and Home Affairs Minister that there is no intention to oust judicial review\". Shanmugam described Lim's use of the phrase \"global policeman\" as \"rhetorical flourish\", and further accused Lim of making speeches that \"made for a good reading on her website\" but were purely \"theatrics with no substance, calculated to mislead\".\n\nLim rose to ask that a division be recorded at the second and third readings of the Bill. The bill to amend the act was ultimately passed with 77 ayes, 10 noes and 2 abstentions after a 4-hour debate. Eight of the WP elected MPs and NCMPs, as well as NMPs Kok Heng Leun and Azmoon Ahmad voted against the renewal of the CLTPA.\n\nAddressing Parliament on the second day of the Financial Budget debate on 28 February 2018, Lim focused her speech on addressing social and economic inequality and how it posed a threat to Singapore's solidarity. Lim also questioned if the Government had commissioned independent studies on social mobility using longitudinal data.\n\nOn 1 March 2018, Lim also pointed out that the Government had earlier floated \"test balloons\" on a possible GST hike but the public noted a contradiction with Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's earlier statements that the Government already had enough money for the decade. This was, in Lim's view, a possible factor that led to the tax hike of two percentage points to 9% taking place only sometime between 2021 and 2025 instead of immediately. She said, \"I rather suspect myself that the Government is stuck with that announcement otherwise... perhaps we would be debating a GST hike today.\"\n\nLaw Minister K Shanmugam and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat rejected Lim's suspicion and demanded that Lim withdraw her statements. In particular, Shanmugam said that Lim had implied that the government was being dishonest by backing down on its plans, which was a \"thoroughly hypocritical and dishonest statement typical of the statements she makes in this House\".\n\nIn a fiery exchange which saw Shanmugam and Lim responding and talk over each other, Lim refused to retract her statements and defended her views as her \"honest suspicion\". Lim fired back, \"The Government can rebut our speeches robustly, that's fine, but I don't think I'm disentitled to come to Parliament to advance honestly held beliefs or suspicions\". The debate got so heated that Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin had to interject and remind MPs to respond only when their names were called.\n\nMany online commentators on Channel News Asia's Facebook page, citing the presence of parliamentary privilege and the fact that it was an elected MP's duty to voice out the concerns of the public, were largely unconvinced by Shanmugam's accusations and saw no issue with Lim's statement. They also pointed out that Shanmugam seemed to have a personal discontent with Lim, judging from the numerous occasions in which both had clashed in Parliament. Lim highlighted this in Parliament in a statement during clarification time, “I can understand why he wants to accuse me of various things because he probably was not happy about past debates where I had disagreed with some of his legislative changes and in typical fashion, he always accuses me of dishonesty when as far as I am concerned I’ve acted honestly.”\n\nThe debate continued into the following day, with Heng demanding that Lim apologise to the House \"as an honourable MP should\" for her statements, and Shanmugam posting on Facebook with an edited video charging that Lim had \"made serious, baseless insinuations\".\n\nSpeaking at the start of the Parliamentary sitting on 6 March 2018, Leader of the House and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu demanded that Lim apologise to the House by 8 March 2018 and to withdraw her \"allegation\" that the Government had floated “test balloons” on the need to raise the GST. Fu had said Lim \"cannot contend that her suspicion remains reasonable and honestly held\" when clarification has been given to her by ministers in Parliament and elsewhere. Lim was not present in the chamber when Fu made her statement.\n\nLim responded to the issue in Parliament on 8 March 2018. In her 6-minute statement, Lim said she could accept her suspicion “may not have been correct”, but strongly rejected the government's accusation that her suspicion on the timing of the GST hike had no basis, and set out in detail a chronology of events including news reports and data published by economists which led to her to believe the GST might be raised in 2018. According to States Times Review, over 20 news reports of impending GST hike have been published by government-owned news media companies during the period of three months prior to Budget 2018 while the government ministries themselves maintained totally silent on the issue, thereby forming the basis of test balloons used in Lim's analogy. Lim reiterated that the public was worried about the impending GST hike, and she was not accusing the government of dishonesty.\n\nLim therefore stated plainly that she was not going to offer any apology and will not retract any of her statements as she believed she was doing her “constitutional role” as an elected MP to “convey ground concerns, reactions and confusion\".\n\nIn an ensuing robust exchange, Fu expressed “disappointment” and condemned Lim for her “low standards, lack of integrity … dishonourable and deplorable conduct” and threatened to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should Lim repeat statements of such a nature.\n\nLim rose again to respond strongly against Fu's charges by quoting a part of Prime Minister Lee's closing speech during the 38 Oxley Road saga, \"If MPs believe that something is wrong, it's MPs' job to pursue the facts and make these allegations in their own name, decide whether something seems to be wrong. And if you think something is wrong, even if you're not fully sure, then come to this House, confront the Government, ask for explanations and answers.\" Lim requested Fu to clarify if there was a “difference in standard here – One standard when the PM’s name needs to be cleared, and another standard when we are talking about raising taxes on the people?”\n\nFinance Minister Heng pressed Lim for the “basis for her suspicions”. Lim responded by taking a dig at Heng, “I don’t think the Finance Minister was listening to my speech.”\n\nAfter the parliamentary debate having ended, various members of the PAP leadership continued to criticised Lim. Indranee Rajah took to Facebook to describe Lim's conduct as \"not honourable\", while Chee Hong Tat wrote in a letter on PAP's website alleging that Lim would use the GST hike issue to attack the ruling party in the next general election. The continued attacks on Lim, however, were met with much public criticism and cynicism on how \"small-minded\" Singapore's leaders were. It was also revealed that the PAP government had sought the AGC's advice on whether Lim had breached parliamentary privilege after failing to get her to retract her statement and apologise.\n\nFormer PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock also weighed in on the issue, voicing out on how the ministers were \"brow-beating\" Lim to extract an apology from her. He said, \"Instead of getting upset, the Ministers should be thankful Sylvia Lim gave them an opportunity to explain. If the government’s position is ‘no’ then just say no and let's just stop at that. No need to get defensive.\" The debate led to numerous Singaporeans breaking out in satire and coming up with various ridiculous reasons for one’s demand of an apology.\n\nLim's current appointments are as follows:\n\nLim's father, Lim Choon Mong, worked in the police force before quitting to study law in London and qualified as a practicing lawyer at age 39. Old photographs from the National Archives of Singapore show Lim's father, who was then in the police force, regularly giving briefings to founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew whenever Lee visited the army barracks. In an interview with \"The Straits Times\" in 2013, Lim said much of her early political education were received in large part from her father. Her father died in August 2017. Lim's mother was a nurse.\n\nLim is a Catholic. While speaking at the CANA Catholic Centre Talk of the Town event in 2014, Lim said she tries \"to read the bible everyday\" but prefers to keep her faith private, adding that it is \"not my nature to evangelise\" as others may already have their own religion in which they take comfort in.\n\nHer classmates in law school at the National University of Singapore (NUS) included PAP MP Lim Biow Chuan and acclaimed artistic directors Ivan Heng and Ong Keng Sen.\n\n"}

After 1914, Wilhelm spent time as a player, manager and scout for the minor leagues. In 1921, he became the manager for the Philadelphia Phillies and pitched in four games for the team.\n\nWilhelm held the minor league baseball pitching record for consecutive scoreless innings for 97 years, but he was not recognized as the record holder by baseball officials until 2004. Baseball officials declared Wilhelm the record holder a few days before Brad Thompson was thought to have broken the record. Two days after Wilhelm's streak was thought to have been broken, \"The New York Times\" reported that a historian found three scoreless innings that were previously left off of Wilhelm's streak, indicating that his record had not actually been broken. Wilhelm is still the current record holder.\n\nWhile pitching for the Birmingham Barons in 1902, Wilhelm threw back-to-back one-hit games. This attracted the attention of Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss, who invited Wilhelm to spring training with the Pirates in 1903. Wilhelm appeared in 12 games that year for the Pirates, finishing with a 5–3 win-loss record. He played with the Boston Beaneaters in the next two seasons. In 1904, Wilhelm earned a 14–20 record and gave up a league-high 118 earned runs. The next year he gave up 122 earned runs, second highest in the league, and finished with a 3–23 record. Wilhelm became commonly known as \"Kaiser\" during his career, a nickname that originated from the early 20th century German emperor Wilhelm II.\nPlaying for the Barons in 1906, Wilhelm pitched the team's first perfect game since its founding in 1884. The 1906 Barons won the team's first title since joining the Southern Association in 1901. His record that year was 22–13. He had similar success the following year, finishing 23–14. Wilhelm returned to the major leagues with the Brooklyn Superbas from 1908 to 1910. His most notable game from that period may have been a three-hit, thirteen-inning win on Opening Day 1909; opposing pitcher Red Ames had a no-hitter going into the tenth inning. In his three seasons with Brooklyn, he registered a 22–42 record.\n\nWilhelm was back in the minor leagues with Rochester in 1911. In three seasons with Rochester, he won 48 games and lost 24 games. Before the 1914 baseball season, Wilhelm was signed by the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League (FL). In 1915, the new Colonial League emerged with backing from the FL. An agreement between the leagues provided each Colonial League team with six FL players; the FL received $200 per month for each player sent to the new league. When ordered to the new league by FL officials, Wilhelm refused to report. Instead, he was made an FL umpire.\n\nIn 1916, Wilhelm sued the Terrapins on the grounds that he had signed a three-year contract in 1914 worth $10,500 and that he was not allowed to continue with the team after July 1, 1915. Wilhelm spent the 1916 and 1917 seasons with the Elmira Colonels of the New York State League. In those two seasons, he finished 14–19 and 17–16 respectively. Wilhelm pitched for the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League in 1920. That year he was the winning pitcher of both games of a doubleheader, leading the team to 7–3 and 10–0 wins.\n\nWilhelm became manager of the Philadelphia Phillies during the 1921 season. In early September, \"The New York Times\" criticized Wilhelm's team after losing both games of a doubleheader, saying that \"Every day is Labor Day for the Phillies... The Quakers were in perfect stride during both contests and demonstrated that they can lose as easily and dexterously on a holiday as on any other occasion.\" Wilhelm had become the interim manager earlier in the season after Wild Bill Donovan was called as a witness in the trial surrounding the Black Sox Scandal. Wilhelm was discharged from his position in late 1922. Wilhelm's managerial record was 83–137 in Philadelphia, which included 96 losses in 1922.\n\nIn 1923, Wilhelm made his final professional appearance as a player, taking part in a single game for the Rochester Tribe. In the summer of 1928, Wilhelm took a position as scout for the Montreal Royals. Wilhelm died in 1936 and a benefit minor league game was held in Rochester to assist his widow.\n\nWhile playing in the minor leagues in 1907, Wilhelm pitched a long streak of consecutive innings without giving up a run. In May 2004, pitcher Brad Thompson was approaching the minor league record for this statistical category, by this time thought by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL) to belong to Urban Shocker. Shocker threw 54 consecutive scoreless innings in 1916. A May 16 Associated Press article said that the NAPBL took a further look at its records and recognized that Wilhelm held the record, having thrown 56 consecutive scoreless innings in 1907. On May 19, 2004, Thompson took his streak to 57 innings before he gave up a run.\n\nTwo days after Thompson was thought to have broken the record, \"The New York Times\" published an article indicating that three innings had been previously left off of Wilhelm's scoreless innings streak, meaning that Wilhelm should still hold the record for the longest such streak in the minor leagues—59 innings. The omitted innings had been discovered by Dave Chase, who was a baseball historian and a minor league general manager for the Memphis Redbirds. Baseball researcher Ray Nemec later found that Wilhelm had come up to the major leagues with his streak intact, then returned to the minor leagues in 1911 and pitched 13 more consecutive scoreless innings. This took Wilhelm's minor league consecutive scoreless innings streak to 72.\n\nAccording to research by Walter Johnson's biographer, the actual record should be 77, from Johnson's 1907 season with the Weiser Kids of the Idaho State League.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313092", "title": "Education in Africa", "text": "Education in Africa\n\nThe education and schools in Africa have changed a lot over time. Ever since it was first introduced to Africa, it has been an important part to the history of the continent. This article describes the problems, technology, history, and other information about the education in Africa.\n\nPrecolonial Africa was mostly made up of tribes who often migrated depending on seasons, availability of fertile soil, and political circumstances. Therefore, power was decentralized in precolonial Africa ( many people held some form of authority as such power was not concentrated in a particular person or an institution). Usually, a person's entitlement to land ( which were mostly patriarchal) gives the person some form of power within the person's household and or within the person's tribe. Households were also economically independent such that members of a household produced their own food, shelter and security. There was therefore no need for a formally organized education in precolonial Africa, as members of each household learned their skills, values, responsibilities, socialization and norms of their tribe/community/household by observing and assisting older household members or community members.\n\nEducation in precolonial Africa was therefore in the form of apprenticeship, a form of informal education, where children and or younger members of each household mostly learned from older members of their tribe/household/community. In most cases, each household member learned more than one skills in addition to learning the values, socialization, and norms of the community/tribe/household. Some of the common skills that people in precolonial Africa had to learn include; dancing, farming, wine making, cooking (mostly the females), in some cases selected people learn how to practice herbal medicine, how to carve stools, how to carve masks and other furniture.\n\nStory telling also played significant role in education during precolonial Africa. Parents, other older members of households and Griots used oral story telling to teach children about the history, norms and values of their household/tribe/community. Children usually gathered around the storyteller who then narrates stories, usually, using personifications to tell stories that encourages conformity, obedience and values such as endurance, integrity, and other ethical values that are important for co-operations in the community.\n\nFestivals and rituals in most cases were also used as means to teach younger members of a household/tribe/community about the history of their household, community and or tribe. Rituals were mainly used to teach young adults about the responsibilities and expectations of adulthood such as teaching females how to cock and care for a household and teaching the men how to hunt, farm, make masks, etc. An example of a ritual which was used to teach young girls about womanhood is Dipo.Dipo was used to teach young girls, usually, adolescents about cocking, motherhood, and other necessary womanhood skills and values before they marry (engage in sexually related activities).\n\nThe origins of African education may be found in Egypt in Northern Africa. One of the first convenient mediums for retaining information, papyrus, was used to develop systems for learning and developing new ideas. In fact, one of the first forms of higher education in Africa were the School of Holy Scriptures built in Ethiopia and Al-Azhar which was in Egypt. These schools became cultural and academic centers as many people traveled from all over the globe for knowledge and instruction. Well before contact with external cultures, Africans had developed pools of understanding and educational tools.\n\nThe onset of the colonial period in the 19th century marked the beginning of the end for traditional African education. European forces, missionaries, and colonists all came ready and willing to change existing traditions to meet their own needs and ambitions. Colonial powers such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France colonized the continent without putting in a system of education. Because the primary focus of colonization was reaping benefits from commercial colonial economies, cash crop production, extraction of raw materials, other physically laborious tasks were prioritized. These economies did not expand to require jobs of a higher skill set or more labor, therefore intensive labor that required little skill was high in demand. Because of such circumstances there was little demand to educate or train the colonized populations. Furthermore, colonial powers were unwilling to offer education to those they colonized unless it benefited them. Either colonial powers did not view investing in African education as a practical use of their revenue or they refrained from educating Africans in order to avoid any uprisings. Those in positions of authority were in fear of access to widespread access to higher education specifically. Colonial powers often found themselves in a debate whether or not to educate their colonized populations and if so, to what extent. Specifically, the British Education Committee of the Privy Council advocated for vocational education and training rather than one focused on academia. This vocational training however neglected professions such as engineering, technology, or similar subjects. Instead the vocational training had a dominant racial overtone which stressed African training for skills fitting with their assumed social and mental inadequacy. Notably, the Belgians under King Leopold prohibited access to higher education in their colonies whereas other colonial powers put in barriers in infrastructure or access such as limiting language of instruction to the language of the colonizer, limits on teaching curriculums, and ensuring the curriculum did not reflect any Afro-ethnicity. By demanding that communities create physical schools with strict curriculum, the foreign powers were able to dictate what the people learned, adjusting it to further their agenda. This not only forced new form and content to education, but abandoned the knowledge gained from the largely informal education. With less community awarenaess, efficiency in learning skills, and especially understanding of the past, African communities began to dwindle in education and prosperity. Aspects of colonialism are still prevalent in African countries that struggled to escape effects of colonization today.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1990s, African countries finally regained their independence. With this recovered freedom, they began to rebuild their traditional forms of education. What had inevitably evolved, however, was a hybrid of the two models. With the collaboration of donor agencies and Western demand, pushes for development of African education and the building of human capital dominated global conversation. Namely, the 1960s were known as the First Development Decade by the UN. Policymakers prioritized secondary and tertiary education before also setting their sights for universal primary education around 1980. This set the precedent for educational planning. Although children and adults may learn from their families and community, a sense of individuality has also developed that today both drives ingenuity and creates separation between groups and cultural tradition. African education programs have developed that involve both groups; an HIV/AIDS awareness program, for example, may involve members coming into communities and sharing their knowledge. Although this is a direct, cognitive approach, they also try to involve all members of the community, allowing for the creation of ownership and cultural acceptance.\n\nThe use of education as a tool of colonization was widespread throughout the French Colonial Empire. Hubert Lyautey, the first Resident-General of French Morocco, advocated for the facilitation of ruling and conquest through cooperation with native elites. To facilitate the relationship with this \"bourgeois” class of francophone Africans, selective educational institutions were established across the French Empire.\n\nThe teaching of the French language in Moroccan institutions of higher education, such as the University of Fez, was intended to “promote economic development and political compliance without assimilating or deracinating the students or preparing them for political agency”. This system allowed colonial authorities to educate a class of native Moroccans that could carry out administrative roles and functions. In his book, \"French Colonial Education and the Making of the Francophone African Bourgeoisie,\" Program Chair of Africana Studies at Washington and Lee University, Mohamed Kamara writes\",\" “For the kind of society the colonialist had in mind, he must create and nurture an elite that will assist for as long as possible in the administration and exploitation of its vast overseas territories”.\n\nIn classrooms, students were given a predetermined curriculum. The basic goal of this classroom practice was to provide only a limited selection of information for students, leaving very little margin for questioning or critical thinking. Only a limited number of families were permitted to send their children to school, which fit with the underlying goal of creating an exclusive class of native-born Moroccans, who would serve as a sort of liaison between white colonial officials and the masses.\n\nEducation in British Colonial Africa can be characterized by three primary phases. The first of these is from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of the First World War, then the Interwar Period, and finally, the conclusion of the Second World War until independence.\n\nFrom the late 19th-Century until the First World War, British colonial education in Africa was largely carried out by missionaries at mission schools. Although these schools were founded with religious intent, they played a significant role in the early colonial machine. Much like in French Colonial Africa, British colonists sought out English-speaking natives who could serve as ‘liaisons” between them and the native population, however, this was done far more out of an economic incentive than a political one. As the demand for English-speaking Africans increased, mission schools provided training in the form of teaching of the Bible. As time went on, however, British industrialists began to complain about the lack of skilled labor, and as such, the British Government supplied mission schools with grants for the vocational training of Africans in various trades critical to British industrial efforts.\n\nBritish colonial education in Africa during Interwar Period can be characterized by a push for uniformity, despite colonial authorities demonstrating their acute awareness of the notable differences between the different regions of the Empire. Critical to this, as well, was the universal recognition of nationality as a basic human right under the Covenant of the League of Nations. Colonies were, as outlined by the League of Nations, to be eventually granted independence, with the European powers entrusted as the stewards of “civilization” for their respective colonies. Colonies were only to be allowed independence once they could demonstrate their capacity for self-rule. In former Governor General of Nigeria (1914-1919), Lord Lugard's, 1922 book, \"The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa\" writes,\n\n“...do not enter the tropics on sufferance, or employ their technical skill, their energy, and their capital as ‘interlopers’ or as ‘greedy capitalists’, but in the fulfillment of the Mandate of civilization”.\n\nIn accordance with this, in 1923 the British Government established the Advisory Committee on Education in British Tropical Africa (with the word ‘tropical’ removed to broaden its jurisdiction). With its establishment, for the first time, the colonial authority would be uniformly administering its educational goals across all British African colonies. Programs begun under the new committee were aimed at increasing the “self-sufficiency” of village economies and providing community incentives to counteract flight into big cities. Educational practices under the CEBA came to be known as ‘adapted’, as it was sought to adjust western education to the contemporary European understanding of the ‘African Mind’ as inherently different -  which is to say, education was often administered through local contexts and practices, all the while teaching western curriculum. In his essay \"British Colonial Education in Africa: Policy and Practice in the Era of Trusteeship\", Aaron Windel of Bowdoin College describes this,\n\n“Typical lessons in a village school operating on adapted principles focused on hygiene, vernacular word building, drill,and basic local geography. Ideally, lessons would be taught on the principle of ‘teach by doing’ and would include objects  from village life. One geography lesson used a bicycle pump, a pail of water, and a small gourd to simulate a ship carrying sugar from India and caught in a monsoon. Adapted pedagogy could also include dramatizations of ‘African tribal histories’ or special holiday plays with an African focus\".\n\nMost British officials (including Lord Lugard) believed that trusteeship would continue for many generations to come, and the goals of ‘civilizing’ the native population began to take precedence. Treatment of colonial subjects continued to vary wildly as determined by race, and white settlers were continuously given preferential treatment in the distribution of land, job opportunities, etc.\n\nAs British-administered schools were taking shape during the Interwar Period, a number of independent schools focusing on literacy and offering alternative curricula began to emerge. Such schools were thought of as a threat to the colonial system and colonial governments were worried that these so-called ‘outlaw’ schools would instill subversiveness and anti-colonial thought in the native populations. One such independent school was formed in Kenya among the Kikuyu, and made English as its language of instruction, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Kikuyu to fight for land property rights in colonial legal and administrative bodies. Over time, as anti-colonial sentiment gained momentum, independent schools were increasingly viewed by the colonial government as breeding grounds for freedom fighters and independence advocates, which culminated in their banning in 1952 as part of the Mau Mau Emergency.\n\nIn 2012, the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goals, a set of development goals for the year 2015, more specifically, “to ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.” That same year, the World Education Forum met in Dakar, Senegal, and adopted the Dakar Framework for Action reaffirming the commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015.\n\nAt the time, according to UNESCO, only 57% of African children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region surveyed. The report also showed marked gender inequalities: in almost all countries enrollment of boys far outpaced that of girls. However, in some countries, education is relatively strong. In Zimbabwe, literacy has reached 92%.\n\nSteps such as the abolition of school fees, investments in teaching infrastructure and resources, and school meals from the World Food Programme helped drive enrollment up by millions. Yet despite the significant progress of many countries, the world fell short of meeting its goal of Universal Primary Education (UPE). In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2013, only about 79% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school. 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school, and enrollment of girls continued to lag behind that of boys. Disparity between genders is partially due to females being excluded from school for being pregnant.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the MDGs in 2015, the UN adopted a set of Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030. The fourth goal addressed education, with the stated aim to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” The World Education Forum also convened in Incheon, Korea to discuss the implementation of this goal, and adopted the Incheon Declaration for Education 2030. It remains to be seen what effect the late12st measures have on the state of education participation in African countries.\n\nRegarding issues of quality in education and equity, there are underlying causes that deter progress such as high drop-out rates, grade repetition, poor quality of education and educational resources, teacher shortages, poor infrastructure and supplies, access to education for rural and remote areas, and stigmas for marginalized groups.\n\nDue to high linguistic diversity, the legacy of colonialism and the need for knowledge of international languages such as English and French in employment and higher education, most schooling in Africa takes places in languages that teachers and pupils do not speak natively, and in some cases simply do not understand. There is considerable evidence that pupils schooled in a second language achieve poorer results than those schooled in their mother tongue, as lack of proficiency in the second language impairs understanding and encourages ineffective rote learning. Although UNESCO have recommended since the 1950s that children be taught early literacy in their mother tongue, progressing later to other languages, not all African countries implement this effectively. Even where the earliest grades are taught in the mother tongue, pupils are typically forced to switch to languages such as English and French before acquiring proficiency in these languages.\n\nAnother reason for the low education rates in Africa is the lack of proper schooling facilities and unequal opportunity for education across countries. Many schools across Africa find it hard to employ teachers due to the low pay and lack of suitable people. This is particularly true for schools in remote areas. Most people who manage to receive education would prefer to move to big cities or even overseas where more opportunities and higher pay await. Thus, there will be an overly large class sizes and high average number of students per teacher in a school. Moreover, the teachers are usually those unqualified with few teaching aids and/or textbook provision. Due to this, children attending schools in rural areas usually attain poorer results in standardised tests compared to their urban counterparts. This can be seen in the reports given by the Northern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ). Those taking the tests in rural areas score much lower than those in small towns and big cities. This shows a lack of equal education opportunity given to children from different parts of the same country.\n\nWith teachers being less qualified than others in urban areas the teaching to learning environment takes an effect amongst the students. In one instance teachers took the same test as their students and three fourths of them had failed. In addition, those that do not receive the same education to those in the bigger cities have trouble even after graduation with reading, writing, and doing math. Students who do not attain the same equal education to those in urban environments do not achieve the same outcome in establishing success with a career. With education being a major concern towards achieving a career and establishing a future, Africa needs to be aware that equal education needs to be established within all schools throughout the countries.\n\nNext, emigration leads to a loss of highly educated people and financial loss. The loss of skilled people can only be replaced with another huge cost which imply the loss of money spent educating people who leave and new people to replace them. Even though an almost 5.5% of GDP investment in education, the loss makes it difficult for the government to budget another amount in education as they will need to prioritize other needs such as military budget and debt servicing.\n\nWestern models and standards still continue to dominate African education. Because of colonization African institutions, particularly universities, still instruct using Euro-centric curriculums with almost no connection to life in Africa. This is further perpetuated by the use of European and American imported textbooks. Many view this lack of self sufficiency as an ongoing effect of colonization upheld by the modern, corrupt African elite. This attitude rests on the basis that during colonization the African ruling elite exploited their own people for their own benefit rather than advocate for the interests of their own people.\n\nThe global water crisis has severe effects on education in rural countries in Africa. Limited access to education and health issues can be further compounded by inadequate water systems or disease that may follow. Malaria, cited to be a main cause of death in Africa, is a mosquito-borne disease that can commonly be found in unmanaged pools of still water. The mosquitos breed in such pools and consequently children who drink from these pools can die or fall severely ill. Furthermore, such an intense illness can later affect the cognitive abilities of children who fall ill at a young age. This is not only applicable biologically but also as an effect of falling ill: children who miss a significant amount of school are unable to optimize their education due to missing lessons.\n\nMilitary spending is causing education spending to decrease immensely. According to a March 2011 report by UNESCO, armed conflict is the biggest threat to education in Africa. While the number of dropouts across the continent has been increasing dramatically, one of the influences of war and conflict on education is the diversion of public funds from education to military spending. An already underfunded system is losing more money. Twenty-one African countries have been identified as the highest spenders of gross domestic product on military globally compared with the amount directed toward education. Military and conflict also leads to the displacement of children. It often forces them to remain in camps or flee to their neighboring countries where education is not available the world is going to explode to them.\n\nInitiatives to improve education in Africa include:\n\n\n\nA 2010 Transparency International report, with research gathered from 8,500 educators and parents in Ghana, Madagascar, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda, found that education is being denied to African children in incredibly large numbers.\n\nA lack of parent involvement, especially as an overseer of government activities also leads to enormous corruption. This was most often found to be because parents and communities feel as though they lack any kind of power in regard to their child's education. In Uganda only 50% of parents believe that they have the power to influence decisions regarding the education of their child. In Morocco, just 20% of parents believed they held any sort of power.\n\nThe unavailability and incompleteness of records in schools and districts prevents the documentation and prevention of corrupt practices. The African Education Watch conducted surveys all over the continent and identified the three most common practices of corruption:\n\n\nWithout this basic education, the report found it was nearly impossible to go on to high school or college. African children are missing this link that allows them to have a chance in trade or to go beyond their villages.\n\nA report by USAID and the Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, found that NGOs are increasingly participating in contribute to the delivery of education services, education policy decisions and are included by donors and government officials in many parts of the education system. Of course, this varies country to country and region to region.\n\nNGOs working in education in Africa often encountered tension and competition when working. Schools, parents and, most often government officials, feel threatened by third-party involvement and feel that they are \"crashing the party.\" The report continues that for NGOs to be effective, they must understand that they do not have the same perspective as government officials as to who is in control. If they do not recognize the government of the country they are working in, they will compromise their objectives.\n\nThe report goes into more detail about NGO relations with governments in education. The relationship is viewed from completely separate points. African governments see NGOs and their work as \"an affair of government\" or, in other words, working as a part and in collaboration with the country's government. NGOs on the other hand view themselves as very separate entities in African education. They see themselves fulfilling moral responsibility. They believe that they are identifying needs or areas of development in situations under which the government has ultimately been unaccountable and separately mobilizing resources toward those needs or development areas. Government and NGOs are hold contrasting beliefs about each other's abilities. Governments often think NGOs are unqualified to make important policy decision and that they could undermine their legitimacy if seen as superior. In some cases, NGOs have found government incompetent themselves, if not their own fault, as the fault of a lack of resources. In the best cases, NGOs and government officials find each other's mutual strengths in education policy and find ways to practically collaborate and reach both of their objectives.\n\nTo be effective in education in Africa NGOs must effect policy and create policy changes that support their projects. NGOs also found that, to see this policy change that they are striving for, they must create and foster relationships with many different stakeholders. The most important stakeholders are usually donors and government officials. The biggest challenge for NGOs has been linking these networks together. NGO interventions to change policy have revealed that NGO programmes have failed to create a successful way to change the policy process while making sure that the public understands and is a part of education policy. This problem will prove more influential in the future if it is not solved.\n\nAdult education in Africa, having experienced a comeback following the independence and increasing prosperity of many African nations, poses specific requirements on policymakers and planners to take into consideration indigenous cultural traits and characteristics. With a moderate backlash against Western ideals and educational traditions, many universities and other institutes of higher education take it upon themselves to develop a new approach to higher education and adult education.\n\nMost contemporary analysts regard illiteracy as a development issue because of the link between poverty and illiteracy. Funding is inadequate and inconsistent and is needed for priority areas such as educator training, monitoring, and evaluation. There is a clear need for investment in capacity development, having a full, sufficiently paid and well qualified professionalized staff, and increasing the demands for adult education professionals. The majority of adult educators are untrained, especially in basic literacy. Governments often employ schoolteachers and others in adult education posts rather than experienced adult educators. Many of the difficulties experienced could be solved by allocation of resources to meet the needs (adequate funds, more staff, appropriate training for staff and suitable material). Underfunding is a huge threat to the sustainability of these programs, and in some cases, to their continued existence. The best-reported data on funding is about adult literacy and non-formal education programs. Funding for continuing education, either academic or vocational is provided and reported on, but little data is given on its financing. Funding may come from public or private sector sources. International and foreign aid is also likely to be important. The costs of much adult education seem to be kept artificially low by the use of state facilities and by the extremely low salaries paid to many adult education specialists.\n\nPublic universities have not been successful in attracting older students onto mainstream degree programs and so the post-apartheid ideal of opening access to public higher education for growing numbers of non-traditional students is not yet a reality. However, certain countries have reported some success rates in Adult Education programs. Between 1990 and 2007 Uganda enrolled over 2million participants in the functional adult literacy program. The Family Basic Education program was active in 18 schools by 2005, reaching over 3,300 children and 1,400 parents. This is a successful family literacy mediation whose impact at household, school and community level has been evaluated.\n\nUnfortunately, the national reports typically do not provide sufficient information on the content of the adult education programs that run in their countries. In the majority of cases the name of the program is as much detail as is given. Curriculum content does not seem to be a major issue.\n\nAfrican communities are very close knit; activities, lifestyles, particularities of individuals are nearly always common knowledge. Because of this, it is difficult for any one member or group within an area to take a significantly different approach to any facet of life within the community. For this reason, program planners for adult learners in Africa find higher rates of success when they employ a participatory approach. Through open and honest dialogue about the fears, motivations, beliefs and ambitions of the community as a whole, there is less social strain concerning individual divergent behavior.\n\nIn addition to strong traditional beliefs, years of slavery through colonization have led to a sense of unity and common struggle in African communities. Therefore, lesson plans in these areas should reflect this cultural sensibility; collaboration and cooperation are key components of successful programs. Teaching techniques that utilize these ideas may include story-telling, experiential simulation, and the practice of indigenous traditions with slight modifications. Every program and lesson must be tailored to the particular community because they almost always learn, live, and achieve as a group or not at all.\n\nInformal education plays a strong role within indigenous learning in African communities. This poses a significant challenge to western-style program planners that emphasize formal learning within a designated time-frame and setting. These requirements must often be abandoned in order to achieve success in communities that have no strong affinity for time and formal education. Programs must be planned that become ingrained into the daily life of participants, that reflects their values and add positive functionality to their lives. Successful programs often involve more long-term learning arrangements consisting of regular visits and the free, unforced offer of information.\n\nAfrican philosophy of adult education recognizes the western ideas such as liberalism, progressivism, humanism and behaviorism, while complementing them with native African perspectives.\n\n\nIn 2000, 93.4 million women in Sub-Saharan Africa were illiterate. Many reasons exist for why formal education for females is unavailable to so many, including cultural reasons. For example, some believe that a woman's education will get in the way of her duties as a wife and a mother. In some places in Africa where women marry at age 12 or 13, education is considered a hindrance to a young woman's development.\n\nA positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the gross national product and increase of life expectancy.\n\nWomen's education is sometimes corrupted by sexual violence. Sexual violence against girls and female students affects many African education systems. In Sub-Saharan Africa, sexual violence is one of the most common and least known forms of corruption.\n\nWhile most of the Millennium Development Goals face a deadline of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. Gender disparity is defined as inequalities of some quantity attributed to the reason of gender type. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Of an estimated 101 million children not in school, more than half are girls. However, this statistic increased when examining secondary school education. In high-income countries, 95% as many girls as boys attend primary and secondary schools. However, in sub-Saharan Africa the figure is just 60%.\n\nThe foremost factor limiting female education is poverty. Economic poverty plays a key role when it comes to coping with direct costs such as tuition fees, cost of textbooks, uniforms, transportation and other expenses. Wherever, especially in families with many children, these costs exceed the income of the family, girls are the first to be denied schooling. This gender bias decision in sending females to school is also based on gender roles dictated by culture. Girls usually are required to complete household chores or take care of their younger siblings when they reach home. This limits their time to study and in many cases, may even have to miss school to complete their duties. It is common for girls to be taken out of school at this point. Boys however, may be given more time to study if their parents believe that the education will allow them to earn more in the future. Expectations, attitudes and biases in communities and families, economic costs, social traditions, and religious and cultural beliefs limit girls’ educational opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, in most African societies, women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the domestic sphere that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing. Because of these traditional gender labor roles, women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day and a decrease in the amount of time available for education, shown by the correlation of decrease in access to water with a decrease in combined primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment of women.\n\nWhatever the underlying reason(s) are, about having large numbers of girls outside the formal schooling system brings developmental challenges to both current and future generations . According to the UNESCO, the rates of female children out of primary school is higher than that of male children in all the African countries where data is available. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it will be impossible to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, placing the rest of the development agenda at risk.\n\nIn Africa and the Arab world, promoting gender equality and empowering women is perhaps the most important of the eight Millennium Development Goals. The target associated with achieving this goal is to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary enrollment preferably by 2005, and at all levels by 2015. Women deserve the instrumental effects of gender equality in education and the intrinsic dimension of female education; which in essence derives from the role of education in enhancing a woman's set of capabilities. Thus, in theory, there is a direct effect from female education to income (or growth).\nEducation, especially for girls, has social and economic benefits for society as a whole. Women earn only one tenth of the world's income and own less than one percent of property, so households without a male head are at special risk of impoverishment. These women will also be less likely to immunize their children and know how to help them survive. Women who are educated tend to have fewer and healthier children, and these children are more likely to attend school. Higher female education makes women better-informed mothers and hence could\ncontribute to lowering child mortality rates and malnutrition. In Africa, limited education and employment opportunities for women reduce annual per capita growth by 0.8%. Had this growth taken place, Africa's economies would have doubled over the past 30 years. It is estimated that some low-income countries in Africa would need up to $23.8 billion annually to achieve the Millennium Development Goal focused on promoting gender equality and empowering women by 2015. This would translate from $7to $13 per capita per year from 2006 to 2015, according to OECD-DAC.\n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from discrimination and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help African women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programmes and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programmes of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programmes, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programmes for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning.\n\nOther global goals echoing these commitments include the World Education Forum's Dakar platform, which stresses the rights of girls, ethnic minorities and children in difficult circumstances; and A World Fit for Children's emphasis on ensuring girls’ equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality. In April 2000 more than 1,100 participants from 164 countries gathered in Dakar, Senegal, for the World Education Forum. Ranging from teachers to prime ministers, academics to policymakers, non-governmental bodies to the heads of major international organizations, they adopted the Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments. The goal is education for all as laid out by the World Conference on Education for All and other international conferences. Between 1990 and 1998 the net enrollment of boys increased by 9 per cent to 56 per cent, and of girls by 7 per cent to 48 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. However, these figures mask considerable regional variations. In countries of the Indian Ocean, both girls and boys attained over 70 per cent net enrollment. The most outstanding progress in terms of percentage increase of boys' enrollment was in East Africa, where the net enrollment of boys increased by 27 per cent (to 60 per cent) and of girls by 18 per cent (to 50 per cent). For girls in Southern Africa, the comparable figures for girls were 23 per cent (to 76 per cent) and for boys, 16 per cent (to 58 per cent). This is the resurgence of a vibrant Africa, rich in its cultural diversity, history, languages and arts, standing united to end its marginalization in world progress and development. A prosperous Africa, where the knowledge and the skills of its people are its first and most important resource.\n\nThe Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) announces a call for the second round of research proposals from research institutions for its Strengthening Gender Research To Improve Girls’ And Women's Education In Africa initiative. The initiative, which is supported by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), promotes girls and women's education through the integration of gender into education policy and practice in sub-Saharan Africa. FAWE believes it is vital to invest in research in Africa as way producing current information for advocacy in education policy. This three-year research initiative aims to work collaboratively with established research institutions to produce pertinent and robust research. That can be used to constructively engage government, policy makers and other regional bodies on strategies to advance girls' education in Africa. Findings from the research will be used to inform FAWE's advocacy work and help redress gender inequities that hinder women's fulfillment of their right to education and meaningful participation in Africa's social and economic advancement.\n\nA joint study by the World Bank and AFD carried out by Alain Mingat, Blandine Ledoux and Ramahatra Rakotomalala sought to anticipate the pressures that would be brought to bear on post-primary teaching. The study puts it this way: \"“In the reference year\" \"(2005), our sample of 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had 14.9 million pupils enrolled in the first year of secondary school. If the rate of completion of the primary stage reaches 95% by 2020 with levels of transition from primary to the first year of secondary maintained at their current level in each country, the first year of secondary school would have 37.2 million pupils in 2020, or 2.5 times the current number. If all the pupils finishing primary school could continue with their education, the number of pupils in the first year of secondary school would reach 62.9 million by 2020, a multiplication by 4.2 over the period.”\" Behind the regional averages, there are still enormous disparities between the countries, and even between the different zones and regions within countries, which means that it is not possible to “[…] identify conditions that apply uniformly to education across the different countries of sub-Saharan Africa.” While some countries have lower demographic growth, others enjoy a more satisfactory level of school enrolment. Only a few countries are falling seriously behind in education at the same time as having to address a steady growth in their school-age population: Niger, Eritrea, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda and to a lesser extent Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Malawi are particularly affected by this dual constraint. The EFA 2012 report highlights great disparities between the sub-Saharan African countries: the percentage of children excluded from primary school is only 7% in Gabon and 14% in Congo compared to over 55% in Burkina Faso and Niger. The gap in terms of the proportion of those excluded from the first year of middle school is even wider, with 6% in Gabon compared to 68% in Burkina Faso and 73% in Niger.\n\nThe majority of out-of-school populations are to be found in countries where there is conflict or very weak governance. At the Dakar Forum, the 181 signatory countries of the Dakar Framework for Action identified armed conflict as well as internal instability within a country as “a major barrier towards attaining Education for All” (EFA) – education being one of the sectors to suffer most from the effects of armed conflict and political instability. In the 2011 EFA Global Monitoring Report, UNESCO pointed out that the countries touched by conflict showed a gross rate of secondary school admissions almost 30% lower than countries of equivalent revenue that were at peace. Conflicts also affect the rate of literacy of the population. At the global level, the rate of literacy among adults in countries touched by conflict was 69% in 2010 compared to 85% in peaceful countries. Twenty States in sub-Saharan Africa have been touched by conflict since 1999. Those countries affected by armed conflict, such as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are furthest from meeting the EFA goals and contain the majority of the unschooled inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in North Kivu, a region particularly affected by conflicts, for example, the likelihood of young people aged between 17 and 22 having had only two years of schooling was twice the national average.\n\nLess than half the children in sub-Saharan Africa can neither read nor write: a quarter of primary school age children reach the fourth year without having acquired the basics and over a third do not reach the fourth year. [A]ccording to the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring Report, “millions of children are leaving school without having acquired basic skills. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, young adults with five years of education had a 40% probability of being illiterate”. The teacher training systems are generally not able to meet the quantitive and qualitative needs of training. In Chad, for example, only 35.5% of teachers are certified to teach.\n\nIn addition to lack of qualified teachers there is also the problem of extra large classrooms in public schools. In Nigeria there are schools with a teacher to pupil ratio of 80-1. This makes it difficult for personalized instruction.\n\nThere is also a lack of culturally relevant teaching-learning aids for teachers and students.\n\nEducational technology in sub-Saharan Africa refers to the promotion, development and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), m-learning, media, and other technological tools to improve aspects of education in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.\n\nThe development of individual computer technology has proved a major turning point in the implementation of projects dependent on technology use, and calls for the acquisition of computer skills first by teachers and then by pupils. Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like Computer Aid International, Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and World Computer Exchange. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like USAID, the African Bank or the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination. States found it difficult to define their national strategies with regard to ICT in Education.\n\nThe American One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$200 and US$500, OLPC offered its ultraportable XO-1 computer at the price of US$100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was “bought” by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the largescale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide (http://one.laptop.org/) and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered. Following on from OLPC, the Intel group launched Classmate PC, a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the Seychelles and Kenya, particularly in rural areas. Also in Kenya, the CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya) project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.\n\nThe cross-fertilization of teaching models and tools has now broadened the potential of ICT within the educational framework. Certain technologies, perceived as outdated compared to more innovative technology, nonetheless remain very much embedded in local practice. Today they are undergoing a partial revival, thanks to the combination of different media that can be used in any single project. Despite its limited uses in teaching, radio is a medium that still has considerable reach in terms of its audience. Cheaper than a computer, it also has a cost-benefit ratio that makes it attractive to many project planners. Launched in 2008, the BBC Janala programme, offering English courses in a combination of different media, including lessons of a few minutes via mobile phone, received more than 85,000 calls per day in the weeks following the launch of the service. In 15 months, over 10 million calls (paid, but at a reduced price compared to a normal communication) were made, by over 3 million users. Television, a feature of very many households, is witnessing a revival in its educational uses, by being combined with other media. As part of the Bridge IT programme in Tanzania, short educational videos, also available on mobile phones, are broadcast on the classroom television so that all the pupils can take part collectively. The e-Schools’ Network in South Africa has also, since March 2013, been developing an educational project, the object of which is to exploit unused television frequencies. There are currently ten schools taking part in the project.\n\nAnother digital tool with multiple uses, the interactive whiteboard (IWB), is also being used in some schools in sub-Saharan Africa. At the end of the 2000s, the Education for All Network (REPTA), in partnership with the Worldwide Fund for Digital Solidarity (FSN) and, in France, the interministerial delegation for digital education in Africa (DIENA) made interactive whiteboards available to schools in Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Mali, along with open content. The use of the IWB has had a positive effect on motivation, for pupils and teachers alike. However, their impact in terms of learning has been muted. This system marginalizes the direct participation of the pupils in favour of multi-media demonstrations initiated by the teacher.\n\nThe main initiatives based on the use of ICT and the Internet in education originally focused on distance learning at university level. Thus, the African Virtual University (AVU), set up by the World Bank in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU has ten e-learning centres. The Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) has also, since 1999, set up around forty Frenchspeaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and master's degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support. More recently, the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe.\n\n\nThere is also a push in many African countries to reform colonial education standards to emphasize the importance of indigenous languages and cultures instead of European languages and cultures. Critics of these reforms maintain that European languages should continue to be the focus of education to ensure that African students can be competitive in a European-dominated global economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2313093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313093", "title": "Environmental security", "text": "Environmental security\n\nEnvironmental security examines threats posed by environmental events and trends to individuals, communities or nations. It may focus on the impact of human conflict and international relations on the environment, or on how environmental problems cross state borders. \n\nThe Millennium Project assessed definitions of environmental security and created a synthesis definition:\n\nEnvironmental security is environmental viability for life support, with three sub-elements: \n\nIt considers the abilities of individuals, communities or nations to cope with environmental risks, changes or conflicts, or limited natural resources. For example, climate change can be viewed a threat to environmental security (see the article climate security for more nuance to the discussion.) Human activity impacts CO emissions, impacting regional and global climatic and environmental changes and thus changes in agricultural output. This can lead to food shortages which will then cause political debate, ethnic tension, and civil unrest. \n\nEnvironmental security is an important concept in three fields: international relations and international development and human security.\n\nWithin international development, projects may aim to improve aspects of environmental security such as food security or water security, but also connected aspects such as energy security, that are now recognised as Sustainable Development Goals at UN level. Targets for MDG 7 about environmental sustainability show international priorities for environmental security. Target 7B is about the security of fisheries on which many people depend for food. Fisheries are an example of a resource that cannot be contained within state borders. A conflict before the International Court of Justice between Chile and Peru about maritime borders and their associated fisheries is a case study for environmental security.\n\nThe Copenhagen School defines the referent object of environmental security as the environment, or some strategic part of it.\n\nHistorically, the definition of international security has varied over time. After World War II, definitions typically focused on the subject of realpolitik that developed during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nAs tensions between the superpowers eased after the collapse of the Soviet Union, academic discussions of definitions of security significantly expanded to encompass a far broader range of threats to peace, including, particularly, environmental threats associated with the political implications of resource use or pollution. By the mid-1980s, this field of study was becoming known as \"environmental security\". Despite a wide range of semantic and academic debates over terms, it is now widely acknowledged that environmental factors play both direct and indirect roles in both political disputes and violent conflicts.\n\nIn the academic sphere environmental security is defined as the relationship between security concerns such as armed conflict and the natural environment. A small but rapidly developing field, it has become particularly relevant for those studying resource scarcity and conflict in the developing world. Prominent early researchers in the field include Felix Dodds, Norman Myers, Jessica Tuchman Mathews, Michael Renner, Richard Ullman, Arthur Westing, Michael Klare, Thomas Homer Dixon, Geoffrey Dabelko, Peter Gleick, Rita Floyd and Joseph Romm.\n\nAccording to Jon Barnett, environmental security emerged as an important concept in security studies because of some interrelated developments which started in 1960s. The first one was the increasing level of environmental consciousness in so called developed countries. Various occurrences and events triggered the growth of the environmental movement during this period of time. Rachel Carson's well-known book \"Silent Spring\" was one of the extraordinary publications of that time and brought greater degree of environmental awareness among ordinary people by warning them of the dangers to all natural systems including animals and food chain from the misuse of chemical pesticides such as DDT. Whilst Carson undoubtedly contributed to public debate at the time she was arguably not amongst the more radical 'social revolutionaries' who were also urging greater public awareness of environmental issues. Moreover, the number of largest well-known environmental non-governmental organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (1961), Friends of the Earth (1969), and Greenpeace (1971) were founded during that time. Climate security is an extension of environmental security. \nThe second notable development which brings the emergence of concept of environmental security was number of scholars started to criticize the traditional notion of security and mainstream security debates in their work from 1970s by emphasizing its inability to handle environmental problems at national and international security level. First commentators were Richard Falk who published 'This Endangered Planet' (1971), and Harold and Margaret Sprout who wrote 'Toward a Politics of Planet Earth' (1971). These two commentators asserted in their book that the notion of security can no longer be centered only on military power, rather nations should collectively take measurements against common environmental problems since they pose threat to national well-being and thus international stability. These main ideas about environmental interdependence between countries and common security threat have remained key themes of environmental security studies. However, not until Richard Ullman publishes an academic article named \"Redefining Security\" (1983), radical departure from the dominant security discourse haven't happened. Ullman offered the following definition of national security threat as \"an action or sequence of events that (1) threatens drastically and over a relatively brief span of time to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state, or (2) threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government of a state, or to private, nongovernmental entities within the state\". Significant other scientists onward also linked the issue of security by focusing on the role of environmental degradation in causing violent conflict. Others, while recognizing the importance of environmental problems, argued that labeling them 'environmental security' was problematic and abandoned analytical rigor for normative and emotional power.\n\nEven though environmental degradation and climate change sometimes cause violent conflict within and between countries and other times not, it can weaken the national security of the state in number of profound ways. Environmental change can undermine the economic prosperity which plays big role in country’s military capacity and material power. In some developed countries, and in most developing countries, natural resources and environmental services tend to be important factors for economic growth and employment rate. Income from and employment in primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining, and from environmentally dependent services like tourism, may all be adversely affected by environmental change. If natural capital base of an economy erodes, then so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Moreover, changes in environmental condition can exposes people to health threats, it can also undermine human capital and its well-being which are essential factors of economic development and stability of human society.\n\nClimate change also could, through extreme weather events, have a more direct impact on national security by damaging critical infrastructures such as military bases, naval yards and training grounds, thereby severely threatening essential national defense resources.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Owned by Entercom, the station broadcasts an adult contemporary format. The broadcast tower used by the station is in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at (), while its studios are located at 2400 Market Street, 4th Floor Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn addition to a standard analog transmission, WBEB broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via Radio.com.\n\nPrior to 2018, WBEB was co-founded and owned by broadcaster Jerry Lee, and was recognized as one of the last independently owned and operated major market FM stations remaining in the United States. WBEB has been a top-ranking station in the Philadelphia Nielsen Audio ratings since the early 1990s; this dominance has been further demonstrated during the holiday season, where WBEB has historically seen the largest ratings gains among U.S. radio stations that switch to Christmas music.\n\nOn May 13, 1963, the station first signed on using the call sign WDVR, which stood for Delaware Valley Radio. It was one of several Philadelphia stations airing a beautiful music format, including WPBS (98.9 FM) and WWSH (106.1 FM). In 1981, it switched call signs to WEAZ, which stood for easy listening. It began using the slogan \"EAZY 101\" with actor Patrick O'Neal and later with actor Robert Urich as its TV commercial spokesperson. By 1984, EAZY 101 had become the #1 rated station in Philadelphia.\n\nThe station was known for playing pop tunes reworked in the form of instrumentals. At first, it played two vocalists per hour, although over time, more vocals were added. The instrumental music was based on the works of such artists as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Neil Diamond, The Carpenters as well as songs from movies and Broadway. By the 1980s, the station increased the number of vocals to four per hour, either from the middle of the road format or from the soft adult contemporary format.\n\nIn 1988, the station completed a transition from instrumental-based easy listening to an all-vocal soft adult contemporary format. This format change came after research showed listeners who grew up after the advent of rock and roll did not like instrumental music. With the format change, the station used a satellite-delivered music service, but by the next year, some of the air staff returned. By 1990, the station's name was shortened to \"EZ 101\". The station would shift to a mainstream adult contemporary format in 1993, and its call sign and branding would change to WBEB, \"B101\", on April 25 of that year.\n\nIn December 2013, WBEB announced the station would rebrand as \"More FM\" beginning December 26, with no change in format. The station argued that the \"B101\" name was dated and did not reflect its current on-air content.\n\nOn July 19, 2018, Entercom announced that it would acquire WBEB for $57.5 million. To comply with DOJ revenue limits, Entercom divested WXTU back to its previous owner Beasley Broadcast Group. WBEB was, at that time, one of the last major-market radio stations to be independently owned. The sale closed September 28, 2018. With the sale's closure, former GM Blaise Howard returned to the station, this time as general sales manager.\n\nOn November 8, 2018, WBEB returned to its previous \"B\" branding as \"B101.1\".\n\nWBEB is short-spaced to three other Class B stations:\n\nWCBS-FM (licensed to serve New York City) and WWDC \"DC101\" (licensed to serve Washington, D.C.) also operate on 101.1 MHz. WBEB and WCBS-FM are 82 miles apart. WBEB and WWDC are 120 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.\n\nIn addition, WBEB is short-spaced to WROZ \"fun 101.3\" (licensed to serve Lancaster, Pennsylvania) as they operate on first adjacent channels (101.1 and 101.3) and the cities they are licensed to serve are only about 61 miles apart.

They were founder members of the English Premier Ice Hockey League but have competed in the NIHL since 2012. Their development team was the Romford Spitfires, which played in Division 2 of the NIHL before being succeeded in 2009/10 by the Romford Fury.\n\nThe team moved to Leyton, East London, in 2013, when it adopted the new name London Raiders. Its team colours are white, gold and blue, and fans of the team are known as the Gold and Blue Army.

{"id": "2313137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313137", "title": "Empire silhouette", "text": "Empire silhouette\n\nEmpire silhouette, Empire line, Empire waist or just Empire is a style in clothing in which the dress has a fitted bodice ending just below the bust, giving a high-waisted appearance, and a gathered skirt which is long and loosely fitting but skims the body rather than being supported by voluminous petticoats. The outline is especially flattering to pear shapes wishing to disguise the stomach area or emphasize the bust. The shape of the dress also helps to lengthen the body's appearance.\n\nWhile the style goes back to the late 18th century, the term \"Empire silhouette\" arose over a century later in early 20th-century Britain; here the word \"empire\" refers to the period of the First French Empire; Napoleon's first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in popularizing the style around Europe. The word \"empire\" is pronounced with a special quasi-French pronunciation in the fashion world.\n\nThe style began as part of Neoclassical fashion, reviving styles from Greco-Roman art which showed women wearing loose fitting rectangular tunics known as \"peplos\" or the more common \"chiton\" which were belted under the bust; providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit suitable for the warm climate.\n\nThe last few years of the 18th century first saw the style coming into fashion in Western and Central Europe (and European-influenced areas). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun had held a \"Greek supper\" where the ladies wore plain white \"Greek\" tunics. Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted. Hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, bonnets or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different color. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. By the turn of the century such styles had spread widely across Europe. In France the style was sometimes called \"à la grecque\" after the decorations found on the pottery and sculpture of Classical Greek art. The adoption of this style led to a drastic contrast between 1790s fashions and the constricting and voluminous styles of the 1770s (with a rigid cylindrical torso above panniers). The change is probably partially due to the French political upheavals after 1789 (which encouraged the recovery of ancient virtues, and discouraged the type of ostentatious ornately luxurious display formerly common in aristocratic fashions). The early styles often featured entirely bare arms, as in the ancient exemplars, but from about 1800 short sleeves became more typical, initially sometimes transparent as in David's \"Portrait of Madame Récamier\" (1800), then puffed. The style evolved through the Napoleonic era until the early 1820s, becoming gradually less simple, after which the hourglass Victorian styles became more popular.\n\nEnglish women's styles (often referred to as \"regency\") followed the same general trend of raised waistlines as French styles, even when the countries were at war. The style was very often worn in white to denote a high social status (especially in its earlier years); only women solidly belonging to what in England was known as the \"genteel\" classes could afford to wear the pale, easily soiled garments of the era. The look was popularized in Britain by Emma, Lady Hamilton, who designed such garments for her performances of poses in imitation of classical antiquity (\"attitudes\"), which were a sensation throughout Europe. The high-waisted cut of the dress was also applied to outer garments, such as the pelisse. The Empire silhouette contributed to making clothes of the 1795–1820 period generally less confining and cumbersome than high-fashion clothes of the earlier 18th and later 19th centuries.\n\nThe 1960s saw a revival of the style, possibly reflecting the less strict social mores of the era, similar to when the unconstricting 1920s \"flapper\" styles replaced the heavy corsetry of the early 1900s.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

It runs for seven weeks during the summer and hosts several seminars during the year.\n\nCamp Galil was founded on its current Bucks County site in 1946 as part of Habonim, a Labor Zionist youth movement. Its name refers to the famously scenic area of northern Israel surrounding the Sea of Galilee. Prior to and during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, Galil used its resources to help the war effort on the Israeli side by holding weapons in its barn. As the new Jewish state emerged, Galil trained and educated many of its members to visit Israel and eventually make Aliyah (literally to \"go up), or move to the Land of Israel. Galilniks, along with other members of Habonim, helped found and build several kibbutzim (socialist farming communities) all over Israel, including Gesher Haziv, Urim, and others.\n\nSince that time, Galil has focused more on its summer camp and year-round programming. Its slogan is \"the spirit of kibbutz...close to home!\" emphasizing the community-minded values of the kibbutz movement, but in an American Jewish context. The main goal of Galil today is to teach young people to be Jewish leaders in their own communities.\n\nGalil is a very active machaneh (camp), both as part of HDNA and as part of the Philadelphia Jewish community.\n\nGalil runs a seven-week summer camp every year which is split into two sessions. First session is four weeks long and runs from late June to mid July. Second session is three weeks long and runs from mid July to early August. Each session has about 130-160 chanichim (campers), with second session usually having fewer chanichim than first. Younger, first-year, chanichim can also opt to come for only two weeks and then extend their stay.\n\nIn 2010, Galil introduced a new program called \"Taste of Galil\" for campers finishing second grade only. They spend four days in a one-on-one setting with their counselors and the other campers their age.\n\nThough the summer camp only runs for seven weeks, Galil remains active year-round! During the rest of the year, Eizor Galil represents all the Habonim Dror members from the Philadelphia area. Different age groups are split into kenim (literally \"nests\"), and have various kef (fun) activities run for them by their year-round counselors, such as movies, bowling, haunted hay rides, fondue parties, and ice skating as well as chinuch (educational) activities which expand on the different curricular themes of the previous summer.\n\nAlso during the year are about five annual events which all the kenim participate in together. In September, Galil kicks off the events with an annual potluck dinner. Every fall and spring, Galil opens its gates for a three-day \"seminar,\" where camp is in session from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning. This is a great time for people considering Galil to see what it's really like, and for people who've already been there to meet up with their friends. Every winter there is also a one-night Chanukkah sleepover, usually at a JCC. Eizor Galil (which is composed of all the kenim together) also normally runs celebrations for Passover, Purim, or both.\n\nGalil is attended by children finishing grades 3 through 9, who are split into schavot (age groups).\n\n\nHabonim Dror (The Builders of Freedom) has six active camps in North America, five of which were originally Habonim and one of which was originally Dror. All the other Dror Machanot have folded. The camps are called (and located in) Miriam (Vancouver, Canada), Tavor (MI), Gesher (Ontario, Canada), Moshava (MD), Galil (PA), and Gilboa (CA). Gesher was originally Dror.\n\nPost 10th graders from Galil participate with 10th graders from all 6 Habonim Dror North America camps in a summer program in Israel called Machaneh Bonim b'Israel (MBI).\n\nPost 11th graders engage in a summer leadership program called \"Madatz\". This is a tochnit (program) dedicated to developing hadracha (leadership) and heightening the sense of kvutsah (group), similar to a CIT type experience and most of the graduates go on to become \"Madrachim\" (counselors) the following summers and youth leaders during the school year.\n\nPost 12th graders participate in the Habonim Dror year program in Israel—the oldest such program—known as Workshop. Workshop is in its 65th year (as of 2015). Chanichim (campers) and madrichim (councilors) alike identify themselves by their workshop number (or madatz year) and some even have a symbol for it.\n\nNotable alumni include:\n\nCamp Galil bought its 63-acre campsite in 1946 from the local Young Women's Christian Association. Few of the buildings that already existed are still in use today. The original dining hall was turned into an assembly building (moadon) after the first major building project on site. That moadon was torn down, replaced by the Amy Adina Schulman Center in 2011. This two-building complex includes a stage, radio room, fireplace, musical instrument practice space, offices, and a resource room. The Amy Adina Schulman Center—known around camp as the MoAdina and Beit Adina—are named for a Galil alumna who died while studying at Rutgers University.\n\nIn 2013, Galil completed a conservation easement with Tinicum Conservancy to protect most of its acres.\n\n"}

Versions for the Macintosh and Atari ST were announced and developed, but not published.\n\nThe player, taking on the role of the unnamed astronaut protagonist, returns from a failed 100-year voyage to 61 Cygni to find the Earth devoid of humans. Cars are rusted and covered with moss, the streets are completely barren, and everything appears as though the entire human race had just vanished suddenly. The player happens upon a barely functioning computer terminal that is tied into a storytelling mainframe, Homer. Through this interface, the player, assisted by Homer who attempts to weave the information into a coherent narrative, discovers information in order to piece together the occurrences leading to the disappearance of the human race. For instance, spending some time in the Medical Records section may unlock a piece of data in the Science section, and through these links the player can finish the game.\n\n\"Info\" gave the Commodore 64 version of \"Portal\" five stars out of five, describing it as \"engrossing, fascinating, and somewhat disturbing ... like a murder mystery, an expedition, and having amnesia all rolled into one\". Roy Wagner of \"Computer Gaming World\" described the story as \"interesting and well-written\", but felt the interface was tedious. The Amiga version, using a mouse, was considered superior to that of the C64, and only bothered the reviewer by way of slowing down the reading of the story. The magazine's Charles Ardai agreed that the interface was tedious and hesitated to recommend it because it was not a game, but said that the quality of the writing was very high.\n\nA hardcover novel, titled \"Portal: A Dataspace Retrieval\" (1988) and composed mostly of the text from the interactive novel with some new additions, was written by the same author, Rob Swigart, and first published by St. Martin's Press.

Donald Griffin, a zoology professor in the United States, set up the foundations for researches in the cognitive awareness of animals within their habitats.\n\nThe fusion of cognitive science and classical ethology into cognitive ethology \"emphasizes observing animals under more-or-less natural conditions, with the objective of understanding the evolution, adaptation (function), causation, and development of the species-specific behavioral repertoire\" (Niko Tinbergen 1963).\n\nAccording to Jamieson & Bekoff (1993), \"Tinbergen's four questions about the evolution, adaptation, causation and development of behavior can be applied to the cognitive and mental abilities of animals.\" Allen & Bekoff (1997, chapter 5) attempt to show how cognitive ethology can take on the central questions of cognitive science, taking as their starting point the four questions described by Barbara Von Eckardt in her 1993 book \"What is Cognitive Science?\", generalizing the four questions and adding a fifth. Kingstone, Smilek & Eastwood (2008) suggested that cognitive ethology should include human behavior. They proposed that researchers should firstly study how people behave in their natural, real world environments and then move to the lab. Anthropocentric claims for the ways non-human animals interact in their social and non-social worlds are often used to influence decisions on how the non-human animals can or should be used by humans.\n\nTraditionally, cognitive ethologists have questioned research methods that isolate animals in unnatural surroundings and present them with a limited set of artificial stimuli, arguing that such techniques favor the study of artificial issues that are not relevant to an understanding of the natural behavior of animals. However, many modern researchers favor a judicious combination of field and laboratory methods.\n\nBekoff, M and Allen, C (1997) \"identify three major groups of people (among some of whose members there are blurred distinctions) with different views on cognitive ethology, namely, slayers, skeptics, and proponents.\" The latter seemingly convergent with animal rights thinking in seeing animal experience as worthy in itself.\n\nEthicist Peter Singer is an example of a \"proponent\" in this sense, as is biologist E. O. Wilson who coined the term biophilia to describe the basis of a direct moral cognition, that 'higher' animals would use to perceive moral implications in the environment directly.\n\nAccording to Marc Bekoff, there are three different views towards whether a science of cognitive ethology is even possible. Slayers deny any possibility of success in cognitive ethology, proponents keep an open mind about animal cognition and the utility of cognitive ethological investigation, and skeptics stand somewhere in between.\n\n\n"}

Unable to go to the interview because of her appearance, Cathy goes to the unemployment office to collect her check. There she is subjected to the unwanted advances of Beasely, who only wants to bed Cathy.\n\nPhilip proposes a romantic affair, while Cathy is holding out for marriage. Watching from the sidelines are Philip's financial manager, Roger, who sees a therapist, because he feels guilty about helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathy's roommate, Connie Emerson, who knows what Philip is seeking. In a minor subplot, Roger discusses the events as they occur to his therapist Dr. Gruber, but omits mention of Cathy. As a result, his therapist believes that Roger is considering a homosexual relationship with Philip.\n\nPhilip wines and dines Cathy. He takes her to see the New York Yankees play baseball. They watch from the Yankees dugout (he owns part of the team). Cathy's complaints about the umpire while seated alongside Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra (playing themselves) cause umpire Art Passarella to throw all of them out of the game.\n\nPhilip's conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to Bermuda, which only serves to make Cathy agree to go. While in Bermuda, anxiety-ridden over the evening's sexual implications, Cathy comes down with a nervous rash, much to her embarrassment and his frustration.\n\nThe Bermuda trip is repeated, but this time Cathy drinks to soothe her nerves and ends up drunk. While intoxicated, Cathy falls off the balcony onto an awning below. She is then carried in her pajamas through the crowded hotel lobby.\n\nAt the urging of Roger and Connie, who are convinced that Philip is in love with her, Cathy goes on a date with Beasley, whom she dislikes, to make Philip jealous. Her plan succeeds and she and Philip get married. On their honeymoon, he breaks out in a nervous rash himself. The film ends with Cathy and Philip months later, walking with their baby and Roger through a park. The two leave Roger alone with the baby for a few moments, during which time Dr. Gruber approaches him to ask how things are going with Philip. In response Roger joyously displays the baby, causing another misunderstanding with his therapist.\n\n\nIn May 1962, Fawcett's line of Gold Medal Books issued a paperback novelization by-lined John Tessitore.

{"id": "2313172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313172", "title": "Cartoon Cartoons", "text": "Cartoon Cartoons\n\nCartoon Cartoons is a collective name used by Cartoon Network for their original animated series from 1996 to 2003. The majority of them were produced by Hanna-Barbera and/or Cartoon Network Studios. The concept of Cartoon Cartoons was spearheaded by Fred Seibert, and originated from his animation anthology series, \"What a Cartoon!\" (later re-titled to \"The Cartoon Cartoon Show\"). Once their popularity had grown, the Cartoon Cartoons were featured on the network's Friday night programming block, Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.\n\nThe name was retired by the network in 2003 and officially met its demise in 2009, when \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" ended. Since their heyday, re-runs of the Cartoon Cartoons have continued to air on \"The Cartoon Cartoon Show\" (2005–2008) and \"Cartoon Planet\" (2012–2014).\n\nCartoon Cartoons first appeared as shorts on animation showcase series \"What a Cartoon!\" in 1995, under the name of \"World Premiere Toons\". The series was produced by Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network Studios under the direction of Fred Seibert. Seibert had been a guiding force for Nickelodeon (having overseen the creation of Nicktoons shortly prior to his departure) prior to joining Hanna-Barbera and would establish Frederator Studios years later.\n\nThrough \"What a Cartoon!\", Cartoon Network was able to assess the potential of certain shorts to serve as pilots for spin-off series and signed contracts with their creators to create ongoing series. \"Dexter's Laboratory\" was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995, and became the first Cartoon Cartoon in 1996. Three more series based on shorts debuted in 1997: \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", and \"I Am Weasel\" (the latter two as segments of the same show; \"I Am Weasel\" was later spun off into a separate show). These are followed by \"The Powerpuff Girls\" in 1998 and \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" in 1999, and concluded with \"Mike, Lu & Og\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" in 1999, creating a lineup of critically acclaimed shows. In 2001, the network received \"Time Squad\" and \"Grim & Evil\" (the previous state of \"Evil Con Carne\" and \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\"). In 2002, \"\" became a full series after being chosen in the previous year's \"Big Pick Weekend\".\n\nThe \"Cartoon Cartoon\" brand was first introduced in July 1997 for the network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays, originally part of the network's Friday night programming block. This block would become the marquee night for premieres of new episodes and series, beginning on June 11, 1999.\n\nThe Cartoon Cartoons were intended to appeal to a wider audience than the average Saturday morning cartoon. Linda Simensky, vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that the cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article on them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"bawdy\" than their counterparts at Comedy Central and less \"socially responsible\" than their counterparts at Nickelodeon. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output which each individual series managed.\n\nIn October 2003, that same month for the new Fridays premiered on the network, the \"Cartoon Cartoons\" brand was discontinued and the openings of \"Cartoon Cartoons\" that were shown before the opening of the actual Cartoon Cartoon was dropped.\n\nMore shows premiered bearing the \"Cartoon Cartoons\" brand, airing throughout the network's schedule and prominently on \"Cartoon Cartoon Fridays\", which became the marquee night for premieres of new episodes and shows beginning June 11, 1999. On October 3, 2003, the block was rebooted under a hybrid live-action format as \"Fridays\", hosted by Tommy Snider and Nzinga Blake, the latter of whom was later replaced by Tara Sands. It aired shows outside the \"Cartoon Cartoon\" moniker, such as \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\", \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\", \"The Life and Times of Juniper Lee\", \"Camp Lazlo\", \"My Gym Partner's a Monkey\", \"Squirrel Boy\", and \"Class of 3000\". The last airing of \"Fridays\" was on February 23, 2007.\n\nAs early as September 2005, the \"Cartoon Cartoons\" label was primarily used for \"The Cartoon Cartoon Show\", a half-hour program featuring episodes of older Cartoon Cartoons that were no longer shown regularly on the network, and \"Cartoon Cartoons The Top 5\", an hour-long program featuring a countdown of the week's five \"best\" Cartoon Cartoons from the older lineup.\n\nThe block Cartoon Planet was revived on Cartoon Network on March 30, 2012, airing in a format similar to \"The Cartoon Cartoon Show\". It features Cartoon Cartoons such as \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", \"I Am Weasel\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\", \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\", \"\", \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\", and other original Cartoon Network Studios series such as \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\", \"Camp Lazlo\", and \"Chowder\". Cartoon Planet returned on October 5, 2012, for Cartoon Network's 20th anniversary.\n\nIn the \"OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes\" episode \"\"Crossover Nexus\"\", the \"Cartoon Cartoon\" logo can be seen in the bottom of a wall inside the Cartoon Network headquarters, as well the theme song is also heard in the scene when Ben Tennyson (Ben 10) shapeshifts into different Cartoon Network characters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2313185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313185", "title": "Adelardo López de Ayala y Herrera", "text": "Adelardo López de Ayala y Herrera\n\nAdelardo López de Ayala y Herrera (1828–1879), Spanish writer and politician.\n\nHe was born at Guadalcanal, Seville on 1 May 1828, and at a very early age began writing for the theatre of his native town. The titles of these juvenile performances, which were played by amateurs, were \"Salga por donde saliere\", \"Me voy a Sevilla\" and \"La Corona y el Fugal\". As travelling companies never visited Guadalcanal, and as ladies took no part in the representations, these three plays were written for men only. Ayala persuaded his sister to appear as the heroine of his comedy, \"La Primera Dama\", and the innovation if it scandalized some of his townsmen, permitted him to develop his talent more freely.\n\nIn his twentieth year he matriculated at the University of Seville, but his career as a student was undistinguished. In Seville he made acquaintance with García Gutiérrez, who is reported to have encouraged his dramatic ambitions and to have given him the benefit of his own experience as a playwright. Early in 1850, Ayala removed his name from the university books, and settled in Madrid with the purpose of becoming a professional dramatist. Though he had no friends and no influence, he speedily found an opening. A four-act play in verse, \"Un Hombre de Estado\", was accepted by the managers of the Teatro Español, was given on 25 January 1851, and proved a remarkable success.\n\nHenceforward Ayala's position and popularity were secure. Within a year he became more widely known by his \"Castigo y Perdón\", and by a more humorous effort, \"Los Dos Guzmanes\"; and shortly afterwards he was appointed by the \"Moderado\" (moderate) government to a post in the home office, which he lost in 1854 on the succession to power of the Liberal party.\n\nIn 1854 he produced \"Rioja\", perhaps the most admired and the most admirable of all his works, and from 1854 to 1856 he took an active part in the political campaign carried on in the journal \"El Padre Cobos\". A \"zarzuela\" entitled \"Guerra a Muerte\", for which Emilio Arrieta composed the music, belongs to 1855, and to the same collaboration is due \"El Agente de Matrimonios\".\n\nAt about this date Ayala passed over from the Moderates to the Progressives, and this political maneuver had its effect upon the fate of his plays. The performances of \"Los Comuneros\" were attended by members of the different parties; the utterances of the different characters were taken to represent the author's personal opinions, and every speech which could be brought into connection with current politics was applauded by one half of the house and derided by the other half.\n\nA \"zarzuela\" named \"El Conde de Castralla\" was given amid much uproar on 20 February 1856, and, as the piece seemed likely to cause serious disorder in the theatre, it was suppressed by the government after the third performance. Ayala's rupture with the Moderates was now complete, and in 1857, through the interest of General Leopoldo O'Donnell, he was elected as Liberal deputy for Badajoz.\n\nHis political changes are difficult to follow or explain, and they have been unsparingly censured. So far as can be judged, Ayala had no strong political views, and drifted with the current of the moment.\n\nHe took part in the revolution of 1868, wrote the \"Manifesto of Cadiz\", took office as colonial minister, favored the candidature of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, resigned in 1871, returned to his early conservative principles, and was a member of Alfonso XII's first cabinet.\nMeanwhile, however divided in opinion as to his political conduct, his countrymen were practically unanimous in admiring his dramatic work; and his reputation, if it gained little by \"El Nuevo Don Juan\", was greatly increased by \"El Tanto por Ciento\" and \"El Tejado de Vidrio\". His last play, \"Consuelo\", was given on 30 March 1878. Ayala was nominated to the post of president of the congress shortly before his death, which occurred unexpectedly on 30 January 1879.\n"}

The film covers the lives of Charles Manson and his \"family\" of followers.\n\nIn 1996, Jack Wilson is producing a crime docuseries segment on The Manson Family murders. Narrated via contemporaneous interviews and flashbacks, several former members of Charles \"Charlie\" Manson''s \"family\" recount their time spent leading up to the August 1969 murder spree. Tex Watson is brought to Spahn Ranch, a former movie set-turned-commune where Manson is housing his followers. Tex ingratiates himself with the group, who spend their time taking copious amounts of LSD, smoking marijuana, and engaging in group sex; meanwhile, Charlie unsuccessfully attempts to get a record deal with his folk music.\n\nSeveral of the male members, including Tex and Bobby Beausoleil, attempt to recruit Simi, a young woman, into the family. They convince her to take LSD before the entire family gang rapes her at Charlie's command. The group begin breaking into random homes in Los Angeles, stealing items and rearranging furniture while the occupants sleep. Later, during a dispute over a drug transaction, Charlie shoots and kills Lotsapoppa, an African American drug dealer whom he suspects is part of the Black Panthers.\n\nThe whole family engage in a mass ritualistic orgy in which they sacrifice a puppy. After, Tex informs follower Patricia Krenwinkel and several others that he is afraid of Charlie and wants to leave. Meanwhile, Bobby and Susan Atkins confront an acquaintance, music teacher Gary Hinman, at his home, planning to raid his house of money, as they believe him to be wealthy. When the plan goes unsuccessfully, Gary is held hostage for two days before Charlie arrives and slices his ear off. After Charlie leaves, Susan attempts to nurse Gary back to health, but she and Bobby find themselves unsure how to carry out the robbery, as Gary does not have money. As a last resort, Bobby stabs him in the chest, after which he and Susan smother him with a cushion. Susan writes the phrase \"political piggy\" on the wall in Gary's blood before they depart. Bobby is arrested days later while trying to flee town.\n\nUnder Charlie's instruction, Tex, Susan, and Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian depart on the evening of August 8 to break into houses in Los Angeles, and are told to \"bring knives.\" They arrive at a home on Cielo Drive, where Tex shoots Steven Parent, a man sitting in his parked car, near the gate. They enter the home and bind its residents, including Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, and Voytek Frykowski. Tex shoots Jay before stabbing him to death. Tex shoots Voytek as he tries to flee before bludgeoning him with the pistol while the sheepish Linda watches in horror. Susan proceeds to attack Abigail in the kitchen, stabbing her before Tex slashes her throat. Abigail, clinging to life, stumbles outside before collapsing in the lawn. Meanwhile, the pregnant Sharon is brutally stabbed to death in the living room.\n\nThe next night, the four members, in addition to Leslie Van Houten and Steve Grogan, viciously murder Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home. Two weeks later, several members murder Donald Shea at Charlie's instruction, as he fears Donald knows too much and could provide authorities information in the Tate-LaBianca murders. Later, the family members, including Charlie, are arrested and indicted on the murders. From jail, Manson accrues a cult following of young people who speak out in his support to the media.\n\nIn 1996, while Jack Wilson is working on the documentary, a group of heroin-addled countercultural goths inspired by the Manson family break into the office and shoot him to death before taking turns stabbing him. After, they brutally murder a young punk wearing a Manson t-shirt.\n\n\nThe film had a long and troubled production history. Director Jim Van Bebber personally financed the production starting in 1988, and then continued to shoot it sporadically on weekends and off days on rain.\n\nDespite support from various people, including members of the band Skinny Puppy, who provided a musical score (in the form of Download's \"Charlie's Family\" album), the film remained incomplete. A rough cut version screened at a number of festivals during 1997, including at the Fantasia Film Festival in July of that year.\n\nIn 2003, Dark Sky Films stepped in with the funds to finish the film properly, and it has since been released theatrically and on home video.\n\nPhil Anselmo of Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual, a personal friend of Van Bebber, contributed $1000 to the production of the film, as well as “about 80%” of the film’s soundtrack. He also provides his voice as Satan in the Tate Murders sequence.\n\nDespite not being banned in any country in the world, it is classified harshly in almost all countries of the world due to its graphic violence and sexuality.\n\n\"The Manson Family\" received mixed to positive reviews; the film currently holds a 68% 'Fresh' rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

The series makes clear references to I Ching and to the Taoist theory of the five elements: , , , and . Various Taoist elements are incorporated within the story: the existence of the four , the use of cards that act as the , the use of trigrams to represent direction when the Drive is swung (north-south-east-west is represented as 坎-離-震-兌 instead of 北-南-東-西, respectively), the emphasis on the balance of the \"sekki\" (the 24 seasons), and the character \"Nazuna\", who is a Taoist maiden. Also, the show itself can be split into four seasons (13 episodes each), each with its distinct story, purpose, and goals.\n\nThe \"Onmyō Taisenki\" anime was produced by Sunrise, a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Holdings. It has a total of 52 episodes, and was aired weekly in TV Tokyo (from PM 6:00 to PM 6:30) from September 30, 2004 to September 29, 2005. It replaces the series Aqua Kids and then was replaced by series Kotencotenco.\n\n is a 12-year-old Japanese boy who lives near Tokyo. Never having met his parents, he lives an ordinary life with his adoptive grandfather. His grandfather had taught him a series of strange hand movements, which Riku did not know the purpose of until the day his grandfather is attacked near his shrine. But it is not an ordinary attacker. The attacker is a , strange monsters with human owners. Riku comes to the scene and that's where he first gets in contact with his , the device he uses to call and make a with , his Shikigami and, from that day on, best friend. The Shikigami needs, for special attacks, a special series of , one of which happens to be the strange hand movements Riku's grandfather always taught him.\nAs Riku's grandfather decides to leave the house for a journey, the 10-year-old boy and the 10-year-old girl rent rooms in Riku's house. The 17-year-old man, Masaomi, who teaches Riku the secrets of Onmyōdō (such as the use of Tōjinfu, for example), drops by eventually. The three of them have 'contracts' with Shikigami. \nThe main events of Onmyō Taisenki anime are related to the menace of the , a powerful Japanese financial group related to the Onmyoudou; attempting to open the four ; and freeing , a boy who was born with the power to control , and had been imprisoned for thousands of years.\n\n\"Onmyō Taisenki\" shows monsters called Shikigami. There are 24 families of Shikigami (three per family for a total of 72) to represent each Solar term. These monsters are extremely powerful, and their are activated when their owners use certain sequences of In. Every Shikigami has its own In sequences and some have special weapons, which are also activated by the In. Every Shikigami has its own name and a class/family. For example, the name \"Byakko no Kogenta\" means Kogenta of the , one of the four Japanese great Gods; the other three are , , and family. Class names are usually named after gods and flowers.\n\nThe Shikigami can transform into a , which is a giant and extremely powerful form where they usually go berserk. Although Nazuna says that a true Daikōjin occurs when Mind-Technique-Body are together, Riku has been able to summon one when he is highly desperate and emotional (usually when Kogenta is about to be killed). Shikigami can also transform into Daikōjin form by forcing a Tōjin stone into a Shikigami, as Isou does to his Shikigami, Fuji, in Episode 20 (or by inserting a special chip made from the Tōjin stones into the drive). However, these methods only produce a confused and pained Daikōjin and causes the Drive to sprout coils that will eventually kill the Tōjinshi if the Daikōjin is not defeated. In addition, members of the obliterated sect Jin-ryū have been able to change their Shikigami into Daikōjin by using lengthy series of In.\n\nLater in the series when Kogenta and Rangetsu were fighting together against Mikazuchi, both Riku and Yuuma gain the Master Drive and their partner Shikigami are able to transform into a , where the Shikigami still have their sanity but a different appearance. Later, Kibachiyo and his partner gain the Master Drive and could also transform into a Chōkōjin.\n\nWhen a Drive is activated for the first time, the Shikigami will appear behind a shōji and asks what the owner desires, and if it is to the Shikigami's liking, it will accept and a contract will be formed. Once the terms of the contract have been fulfilled, the Tōjinshi and Shikigami will part. However, when a contract is broken (Shikigami dies or Tōjinshi tries to break the contract), the Tōjinshi loses all the memories built since when he first contracted with the Shikigami and usually wanders around lost and depressed while the Shikigami is sent to . Similar events happen with Riku in Episode 23-24, as he rejects his contract with Kogenta and consequently does not remember people he only met after he formed the contract, but still remembers his childhood friend Momo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Onmyou Taisenki manga is published by Jump Comics and runs monthly in V-Jump magazine (2005). Each volume is nine chapters and three have been published: the first one (192 pages) published on October 10, 2004, the second one (200 pages) on August 4, 2005, and the third one (267 pages) on March 3, 2006. The manga has the collaboration of WiZ and Bandai. Each volume costs about 400 Yen (Price inside Japanese territory).\n\nThe Onmyou Taisenki manga does not tell the same history as the anime. The story happens years before the events in the anime. The main character, Yakumo (who also appears on the anime, as a teenager) is the son of Monju, the chief priest of the Taihaku Temple, in Kyoto. Yakumo also trains the \"In\", with a baseball ball. In this temple, a , and Monju's former teacher, Mahoroba, is imprisoned. The problems start when Mahoroba escapes, gains power, and transforms Monju into stone. Yakumo is called by a Zero Drive, which was one of the treasures of the temple. This Zero Drive handles Byakko no Kogenta. The story of the manga is about Yakumo's first steps with a Shikigami, training with Idzuna (Taihaku Temple's shrine maiden) and seeking Mahoroba through various Japanese historical dates. Famous Japanese historical characters such as Oda Nobunaga can be seen on the manga. The story is cited by Kogenta around episode 35 in the anime. However, not many details are given.\n\nEven when the story of the Manga and Anime appears to be in the same universe there are some factual differences in the world of the anime and manga.\nIn the manga the names of the shikigamis are created by their Toujinshi at the time of the contract and in the anime the names of the shikigamis are always the same. For example, in the manga the name of the shikigami that once made a contract with Monju is revealed to be \"Byakko no Akatsuki\", and then it's revealed that is in fact the same shikigami as \"Byakko no Kogenta\", and the name Kogenta is the name that Yakumo gave him. In contrast the anime reveals that the name of Byakko no Kogenta has been always the same, as is revealed in the anime when the story of the contract between Byakko no Kogenta and Raihou is told. \nAlso, in the manga, there are no factions between the Toujinshi, and every Toujinshi is independent.\nEven when in the anime almost every Toujinshi uses a Drive, in the manga almost every Toujinshi uses a Toujinki, with the exception of Yakumo who gets his Zero Drive from the Naraku in the middle of Volume 2 in order to save Kogenta because Yakumo's Toujinki is destroyed, and Tsukuyomi that summons his shikigami with Toujin-fu.\nIt also is revealed in the manga that the Drive is in fact a Toujinki prototype.\nIn the anime when the Toujinshi shikigami is defeated the Toujinshi loses his/her memories as Toujinshi and he/she can no longer be a Toujinshi. In the manga the only consequence of a Shikigami defeat is that the Toujinshi can no longer make a contract with that shikigami.\n\nThere are three Onmyou Taisenki games, being two for PlayStation 2, and one for Game Boy Advance.\nThe first PS2 game is called , and was released on March 31, 2005. The PlayStation 2 EyeToy is required to play this game.\nThe second PS2 game is called , and was released on June 26, 2005. It is a side-story with the same characters from the anime, where Kogenta and Riku train and become stronger through five , which are parallel worlds with lots of . The five Fukumaden featured in this game are Fire, Water, Tree, Earth and . The 'Gold' element from Onmyoudou is also featured in the game, but there is no \"Fukumaden\" for it. \nThe only game for GB Advance is called , and was released on December 12, 2004. \nAll the three games were released in Japan only.\n\n"}

It oversees the seven New Zealand Football federations, as well as the New Zealand national football team (nicknamed the \"All Whites\"), the national junior and women's teams (nicknamed the \"Football Ferns\"), the men's and women's national Leagues ISPS Handa Premiership, National Women's League, and a number of tournaments, including the Chatham Cup and Women's Knockout Cup. A New Zealand team, Wellington Phoenix FC who plays in the Australian A-League also comes under New Zealand Football jurisdiction.\n\nIt was founded in 1891, as New Zealand Soccer Association and became officially affiliated with FIFA in 1948. In May 2007, the organisation was renamed New Zealand Football (NZF), replacing the word \"soccer\" with \"football\" in line with the common usage in the rest of the world.\n\nNew Zealand were admitted as member of the Asian Football Confederation in 1964, but they lost membership later. New Zealand with Australia eventually formed the Oceania Football Federation (now Oceania Football Confederation) in 1966.\n\nIn September 2007, the New Zealand female football teams were re-branded. The women's national team changed its name from \"SWANZ\" to \"Football Ferns\", the female under-20 team to the \"Junior Football Ferns\" and the under-17 team became the \"Young Football Ferns\"\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, New Zealand achieved their best result in their team's history when they had a 1–1 draw with reigning World champions Italy. Shane Smeltz scored in the 7th minute marking the first time New Zealand had ever led a match at the World Cup. They went on to become the only unbeaten team in the tournament.\n\nIn January 2013, members of the FIFA Executive Committee met in a private meeting convened by Joseph Blatter to discuss the possibilities of moving the New Zealand Football Federation for the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) in order to enhance the sport in the country. After the meeting, Blatter said the idea was \"ratified\" but needed some adjustments. This fact provided the New Zealand success in the idea of movement, requiring only a formal request by the association. \nBut in June, the chief executive of the New Zealand Federation, Andy Martin, said his administration has no plans to promote the New Zealand Football to high-level competitions for now, meaning that New Zealand should remain in the weak Oceania Football Confederation.\n\nIn November 2008, Glen Moss was handed a 4-match World Cup ban after swearing at referee Lencie Fred in a dead-rubber 2010 World Cup qualification match against Fiji. New Zealand Football failed to lodge an appeal to FIFA in time after they received notification of the sentence on 23 December and were closing for the Christmas period. Moss was subsequently suspended for the two 2010 FIFA World Cup inter-confederation play off matches against Bahrain and the first two 2010 FIFA World Cup matches against Slovakia and Italy.\n\nIn July 2015, New Zealand was ruled to have forfeited its place in the 2016 Olympic tournament after fielding an ineligible player in its men's Under-23 team; NZF decided not to appeal the decision. It was subsequently reported that up to 16 ineligible players had been fielded in the men's Under-23, Under-20 and Under-17 teams between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIn January 2016, Wellington Phoenix signed Alex Jones on loan to the end of the 2015–16 season. The move fell through when New Zealand Football failed to forward the completed paperwork to FIFA before the transfer deadline despite having received it from the Phoenix three days previously. An appeal to the world governing body was unsuccessful, as FIFA \"ruled to protect the integrity of their global deadlines for the transfer of players\".\n\nOn 19 June 2018, a letter of complaint about current New Zealand women's national football team and New Zealand Football technical director Andreas Heraf signed by at least 10 players was sent to New Zealand football collated by the New Zealand Professional Footballers Association (NZPFA). Later that day it was also announced that New Zealand Football were deliberately flouting a Fifa directive that Heraf shouldn't be in charge of both roles at the same organisation.\n\nThe next day it emerge that the Players Union had sent a strongly worded letter to New Zealand Football, instructing them to discontinue all communications with players after Heraf and other New Zealand Football staff members where contacting players and strongly encouraging them not to write letters or issue any formal complaints.\n\nThat afternoon it was announced that Heraf would be place on special leave while an independent investigation was conducted into the allegations around bullying, intimidation and a culture of fear.\n\nIn recent time, New Zealand Football has enjoyed good success on the international stage. The All Whites overcame Papua New Guinea in the OFC Nations Cup Final by winning 4-2 on penalties in the final. It was their fifth title in the OFC Nations Cup and it secured their place in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.\n\nIn 2015, the Football Ferns reached their highest ever ranking (16), beating Brazil for the second time and qualifying for the Rio Olympics. The Men’s U-20 and U-17 sides qualified out of their groups at their respective FIFA World Cup tournaments in 2015. New Zealand were one of only five countries in the same cycle to achieve this.

Eisenhower, to have been named a Companion of the Ordre de la Libération, France's highest World War II honor. \n\nHasey was born in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1916. In 1936, leaving Columbia University after only one year, Hasey headed to France, telling his parents that he intended to study at the Sorbonne. At the height of the depression, Hasey struggled to find work, but eventually landed a position as a salesman for the French jeweler Cartier.\n\nWhen the Winter War between The Soviet Union and Finland broke out in 1939, Hasey, along with other Americans, formed an ambulance unit, the Iroquois Ambulance Corps, and headed to the war front to help aid the Finns. Later, some time in the 1950s, Finland awarded him the Liberty Cross. After the war, and having recovered from a wound to his arm, Hasey planned to return to his work at Cartier.\n\nWith the German invasion of Western Europe, Hasey promptly volunteered to join the Free French Forces led by General Charles de Gaulle. During fighting around Damascus, Syria on June 20, 1941, Hasey's right jaw and larynx were shot away by enemy machine gun fire. He was decorated by de Gaulle as \"the first American to shed blood for the liberation of France.\" After his recovery, Hasey became a liaison between de Gaulle and Eisenhower. During 1942, he co-wrote a book, \"Yankee Fighter: The Story of an American in the Free French Foreign Legion\" with Joseph F Dinneen. In August 1943, he became an aide-de-camp on the staff of General Marie Pierre Koenig, and remained with Koenig during his term as military Governor of Paris, August 1944.\n\nIn 1950, he joined the CIA and worked in 17 countries until his retirement in 1974.\n\nIn 1996, French President Jacques Chirac named Hasey an officer in the Légion d'honneur.\n\nOn May 9, 2005, Hasey died at age 88 from complications after a stroke.\n\n\n"}

The \"Ugly\" part came from his wife, who joked that Gray was so ugly, he made her look attractive. He became active as a comedian in his native England in the 1960s, before arriving in Australia\n\nHis first television gig in Australia was in 1972, when he hosted a version of the game show \"Beat the Clock\". Although still working as a stand-up comedian, by 1976 Gray had taken a straight dramatic role as publican Bunny Howard in the early episodes of soap opera \"The Young Doctors\". The following year, however, Gray appeared in his most popular role, as a regular panelist on the game show \"Blankety Blanks\". He proceeded to leave his role in \"The Young Doctors\" after his initial 13-week contract expired in order to work on \"Blankety Blanks\", with Kennedy himself convincing Gray to do the game show. Gray had been receiving $100 a day for \"The Young Doctors\", with \"Blankety Blanks\" paying $45 an episode this represented a pay cut. Later Gray signed with agent Harry M Miller who negotiated the increased pay rate of $75 per episode, which remained until the series ended. \n\nGray was appointed \"Court Jester\" to 1977 \"King of Moomba\" Mickey Mouse (a controversial choice with some Melburnians, who preferred 'home-grown' Blinky Bill).\n\nWith his ever-present cigar, Gray became one of the most popular comedians on Australian TV. He became a game show host in his own right, helming \"Celebrity Tattle Tales\" from 1979–80, and \"Play Your Cards Right\" from 1984-85. Gray also appeared in a series of commercials for Half Case supermarkets in the 1980s, as well as spots for other products, including an erectile dysfunction nasal spray in 2003.\n\nIn the 1980s, Gray also presented a drive-time radio program on 3UZ, with Mary Hardy.\n\nAccording to Gray's autobiography \"It's Funny Being Ugly\", Gray was not invited to speak at Graham Kennedy's funeral in 2005, and indeed did not know where the service was being held.

It is an important residential area of and is famous for its schools, market, residential colonies and residences of film artists. Virugambakkam had some of Chennai's oldest film studios.\n\nVirugambakkam is one of the important localities of Chennai and owes its growth to the expansion of the city in the post-independence period. Prior to the establishment of residential colonies, Virugambakkam was a village covered by paddy fields, mangoe orchards and casurina trees.. Virugambakkam was first included within the Chennai city limits in 1977 along with other villages like Saligramam.\n\nVirugambakkam is well-connected with the heart of Chennai city through roads. Buses running through Arcot Road link Virugambakkam with the more inner suburbs of Chennai city.\n\nVirugambakkam is situated at a distance of 14.6 kilometres from Fort St George and 12.5 kilometres from Poonamallee. It is bound by Saligramam in the east, Koyambedu to the north and Alwarthirunagar to the west and south-west and K.K. Nagar and Ramavaram, Tamil Nadu to the south-east. Its frontier with Alwarthirunagar forms the western limits of the Corporation of Chennai.\n\nThe growth of Virugambakkam accompanied the expansion of Madras city during the years preceding independence. Virugambakkam was one of the many localities which cropped up during the Second World War. At that time, it was a part of the Kodambakkam-Saligramam-Puliyur residential district of Greater Madras. During the 1940s, Arcot Road was constructed connecting Nungambakkam with the Mount-Poonamallee Road. In 1948, the first movie studios made their appearance when Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar shifted his base from Karaikudi. The locality has since become a haven for movie producers and cine artists.\n\nVirugambakkam was one of the important places connected with the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1965. Aranganathan, a 32-year-old employee with the Indian Postal Service immolated himself in protest against the imposition of Hindi. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam vigorously campaigned in the Virugambakkam region during the 1967 elections. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has done a first state level meeting it has been organised by V.P Akilan. the meeting has been held in front of Arignar Anna, Karunanithi, M.G Ramachandran and some leaders in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Virugambakkam was little more than an insignificant village. It formed a part of Saidapet taluk of Chengleput district. Apart from a few movie studios, there were only a few sparsely populated settlements. The interior area which makes up the middle-class residential colonies were covered by paddy fields. The town had a population of 8,013 in 1971. During those times, the outlying suburbs of the city alongside Arcot Road had a reputation for insecurity and as the haunt of sex. Until the early 1970s, the suburb of Kodambakkam formed the western frontier of Madras city. Virugambakkam was included in Madras city in 1973 along with Saligrammam. Since then, growth has accelerated, peaking in the 1980s and 1990s. The good quality of ground water available in the Arcot Road suburbs was an important reason for the region's growth.\n\nThe soil is fertile and productive as is evident from the fact that paddy fields once covered the area. However, paddy fields have completely disappeared. Natural gas was discovered near Virugambakkam in 1966. To date, Virugambakkam is the only known source of natural gas in Chennai city apart from Avadi.\n\nOnce Virugambakkam had a big lake which was maintained by Madras Water Supplies and Sewage Board (now called CMWSSB) and drew water for drinking with several pump houses around the lake until 1976, and several small ponds. After that the lake was encroached by antisocial elements with help of all party politicians and converted it into a habitat. The road around that lake turned habitat is called as Erikarai Street. The ponds have also been encroached and turned into habitat.\n\nThe Virugambakkam Canal separates Virugambakkam from suburbs such as Koyambedu, which lie towards the interior. The canal runs for about 6 kilometres through the suburbs of Choolaimedu, Arumbakkam and Vadapalani before entering Virugambakkam. This canal originally served the purpose of irrigating farm lands. However, with the transformation of farmlands into residential localities, the canal has been converted into a drain. During the monsoons, the canal frequently overflows creating havoc for the residents of the nearby areas. In 2003, desilting work was carried out to deal with the situation.\n\nVirugambakkam extends for about 2 kilometres from Avichi Higher Sec. School in Arcot Road to Valasarawakkam. Virugambakkam extends alongside Arcot Road adjacent to Saligrammam in the east, Valasaravakkam in the west, Koyambedu in the north and KK Nagar in the south. State Bank Colony and Baskar Colony are some of the important residential areas in the neighbourhood. Kaaliamman Koil Street which connects Virugambakkam and Koyambedu, Arcot Road are the main arterial roads.\n\nVirugambakkam is known for its movie studios and schools. It is also the home to a large number of film actors, music composers and other artists. The Virugambakkam market which lies to the west is a source for fresh vegetables. Some important temples are Vembuliamman Koil, Kaliamman Koil and Raghavendra temple, Sankarashramam-Sri Raja Rajeswari Temple, Hari Hara Temple, Siva Vishnu Temple. There is also a mosque and numerous churches. Virugambakkam also has a number of hospitals which along with the schools and departmental stores cater to the needs of the residential colonies. Virugambakkam RTO Office located at Chinmayanagar on Kaliamman Koil Street. There are also more number of Nationalised & Private Banks.\n\n\n\nVirugambakkam is well-connected with the heart of Chennai city as it lies on the Arcot Road, which is considered to be one of Chennai's arterial roads. Virugambakkam lies on the Poonamallee-Vadapalani-Broadway bus route. The nearest bus terminuses are Saligrammam, Chennai Moffusil Bus Terminus (CMBT) and Vadapalani. The nearest suburban railway station is at Kodambakkam, 4 kilometres from Virugambakkam. The nearest metro station is at Vadapalani.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313272", "title": "Name of Iran", "text": "Name of Iran\n\nIn the Western world, Persia (or one of its cognates) was historically the common name for Iran. On the Nowruz of 1935, Reza Shah asked foreign delegates to use the term Iran, the endonym of the country, in formal correspondence. Subsequently, the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from \"Persian\" to \"Iranian\". In 1959, the government of Mohammad Reza Shah, Reza Shah's son, announced that both \"Persia\" and \"Iran\" can be used interchangeably, in formal correspondence. However the issue is still debated.\n\nThe name \"Irān\" is first attested in the Avesta as \"airyānąm\" (the text of which is composed in Avestan, an old Iranian language spoken in northeastern Greater Iran, or in what are now Turkmenistan and Tajikistan).\n\nThe Modern Persian word \"Īrān\" () derives immediately from Middle Persian \"Ērān\" (Pahlavi spelling: \"ʼyrʼn\"), first attested in an inscription that accompanies the investiture relief of the first Sassanid king Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam. In this inscription, the king's Middle Persian appellation is \"ardašīr šāhān šāh ērān\" while in the Parthian language inscription that accompanies the Middle Persian one the king is titled \"ardašīr šāhān šāh aryān\" (Pahlavi: \"... ʼryʼn\") both meaning \"king of kings of Iranians\".\n\nThe gentilic \"ēr-\" and \"ary-\" in \"ērān\" and \"aryān\" derives from Old Iranian \"*arya-\" (Old Persian \"airya-\", Avestan \"airiia-\", etc.), meaning \"Aryan\", in the sense of \"of the Iranians\". This term is attested as an ethnic designator in Achaemenid inscriptions and in Zoroastrianism's Avesta tradition, and it seems \"very likely\" that in Ardashir's inscription \"ērān\" still retained this meaning, denoting the people rather than the empire. \n\nNotwithstanding this inscriptional use of \"ērān\" to refer to the Iranian peoples, the use of \"ērān\" to refer to the empire (and the antonymic \"anērān\" to refer to the Roman territories) is also attested by the early Sassanid period. Both \"ērān\" and \"anērān\" appear in 3rd century calendrical text written by Mani. In an inscription of Ardashir's son and immediate successor, Shapur I \"apparently includes in \"Ērān\" regions such as Armenia and the Caucasus which were not inhabited predominantly by Iranians\". In Kartir's inscriptions (written thirty years after Shapur's), the high priest includes the same regions (together with Georgia, Albania, Syria and the Pontus) in his list of provinces of the antonymic \"Anērān\". \"Ērān\" also features in the names of the towns founded by Sassanid dynasts, for instance in \"Ērān-xwarrah-šābuhr\" \"Glory of Ērān (of) Shapur\". It also appears in the titles of government officers, such as in \"Ērān-āmārgar\" \"Accountant-General (of) \"Ērān\"\" or \"Ērān-dibirbed\" \"Chief Scribe (of) \"Ērān\"\".\n\nThe Greeks (who had previously tended to use names related to \"Median\") began to use adjectives such as (), () or () in the fifth century BC to refer to Cyrus the Great's empire (a word understood to mean \"country\"). Such words were taken from the Old Persian \"Pārsa\" – the name of the people from whom Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid dynasty stemmed and over whom he first ruled (before he inherited or conquered other Iranian Kingdoms). Thus, the term \"Persian\" is an exonym and Iranians never historically referred to Iran by that exonym. The Pars tribe gave its name to the region where they lived (the modern day province is called Fars/Pars) but the province in ancient times was smaller than its current area. In Latin, the name for the whole empire was \"Persia\", while the Iranians knew it as \"Iran\" or \"Iranshahr\".\n\nIn the later parts of the Bible, where this kingdom is frequently mentioned (Books of Esther, Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah), it is called ' (), or sometimes ' (), i.e. \"Persia and Media\". The Arabs used to likewise refer to Iran and the Persian (Sassanian) Empire as \"\" (), i.e. \"Lands of Persia\", which would become the popular name for the region in Muslim literature.\n\nIn Greek Mythology, Perseus is alleged to be the ancestors of all Persians, thus giving its name.\n\nThe exonym \"Persia\" was the official name of Iran in the Western world before March 1935, but the Iranian people inside their country since the time of Zoroaster (probably circa 1000 BC), or even before, have called their country \"Arya\", \"Iran\", \"Iranshahr\", \"Iranzamin\" (Land of Iran), \"Aryānām\" (the equivalent of \"Iran\" in the proto-Iranian language) or its equivalents. The term \"Arya\" has been used by the Iranian people, as well as by the rulers and emperors of Iran, from the time of the Avesta. Evidently from the time of the Sassanids (226–651 CE) Iranians have called it \"Iran\", meaning the \"Land of the Aryans\" and \"Iranshahr\". In Middle Persian sources, the name \"Arya\" and \"Iran\" is used for the pre-Sassanid Iranian empires as well as the Sassanid empire. As an example, the use of the name \"Iran\" for Achaemenids in the Middle Persian book of Arda Viraf refers to the invasion of Iran by Alexander the Great in 330 BC. The Proto-Iranian term for Iran is reconstructed as *Aryānām (the genitive plural of the word *Arya); the Avestan equivalent is \"Airyanem\" (as in Airyanem Vaejah). The internal preference for \"Iran\" was noted in some Western reference books (e.g. the Harmsworth Encyclopaedia, \"circa\" 1907, entry for Iran: \"The name is now the official designation of Persia.\") but for international purposes, \"Persia\" was the norm.\n\nIn the mid 1930s, the ruler of the country, Reza Shah Pahlavi, moved towards formalising the name \"Iran\" instead of \"Persia\" for all purposes. In the British House of Commons the move was reported upon by the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as follows:\n\nThe decree of Reza Shah Pahlavi affecting nomenclature duly took effect on 21 March 1935. \n\nTo avoid confusion between the two neighboring countries of Iran and Iraq, which were both involved in WWII and occupied by the Allies, Winston Churchill requested from the Iranian government during the Teheran Conference for the old and distinct name \"Persia to be used by the United Nations [i.e., the Allies] for the duration of the common War\". His request was approved immediately by the Iranian Foreign Ministry. The Americans, however, continued using \"Iran\" as they then had little involvement in Iraq to cause any such confusion.\n\nIn the summer of 1959, following concerns that the native name had, as one politician put it, \"turned a known into an unknown\", a committee was formed, led by noted scholar Ehsan Yarshater, to consider the issue again. They recommended a reversal of the 1935 decision, and Mohammad Reza Shah approved this. However, the implementation of the proposal was weak, simply allowing \"Persia\" and \"Iran\" to be used interchangeably. Today, both terms are common; \"Persia\" mostly in historical and cultural contexts, \"Iran\" mostly in political contexts.\n\nIn recent years most exhibitions of Persian history, culture and art in the world have used the exonym \"Persia\" (e.g., \"Forgotten Empire; Ancient Persia\", British Museum; \"7000 Years of Persian Art\", Vienna, Berlin; and \"Persia; Thirty Centuries of Culture and Art\", Amsterdam). In 2006, the largest collection of historical maps of Iran, entitled \"Historical Maps of Persia\", was published in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the 1980s, Professor Ehsan Yarshater (editor of the \"Encyclopædia Iranica\") started to publish articles on this matter (in both English and Persian) in \"Rahavard Quarterly\", \"Pars Monthly\", \"Iranian Studies Journal\", etc. After him, a few Iranian scholars and researchers such as Prof. Kazem Abhary, and Prof. Jalal Matini followed the issue. Several times since then, Iranian magazines and Web sites have published articles from those who agree or disagree with usage of \"Persia\" and \"Persian\" in English.\n\nThere are many Iranians in the West who prefer \"Persia\" and \"Persian\" as the English names for the country and nationality, similar to the usage of \"La Perse/persan\" in French. According to Hooman Majd, the popularity of the term \"Persia\" among the Persian diaspora stems from the fact that Persia' connotes a glorious past they would like to be identified with, while 'Iran' since 1979 revolution... says nothing to the world but Islamic fundamentalism.\"\n\nSince 1 April 1979, the official name of the Iranian state is Jomhuri-ye Eslāmi-ye Irān (Persian: جمهوری اسلامی ایران), translated to the \"Islamic Republic of Iran\" in English.\n\nOther official names were Dowlat-e Aliyye-ye Irân () meaning the \"Sublime State of Persia\" and Kešvare Šâhanšâhiye Irân () meaning \"Imperial State of Persia\" and the \"Imperial State of Iran\" after 1935.\n\n\n\n"}

The wide main channel of the Columbia (and the Washington/Oregon state line) passes north of the island. To the south, sheltered by the island, is a smaller channel known as North Portland Harbor. Much of Hayden Island (and connected Tomahawk Island to the east) is within Portland city limits, and recognized as one of its 95 neighborhoods.\n\nInterstate 5 provides the only roadway connection to the island, via the northernmost Oregon exit, to the rest of North Portland and, with the Interstate Bridge, to Vancouver to the north. The BNSF Railway crosses North Portland Harbor (via the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge) and the western part of the island to the west of I-5, before crossing the Columbia via the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6. The east end of the island, often called Jantzen Beach, has highly developed retail areas near the freeway, hotels, offices, manufactured home communities, and condominium complexes. Further east there are several houseboat moorages and marinas.\nUntil the Interstate Bridge opened in 1917, ferries provided service between Portland and Vancouver from landings on the island's north shore. After the opening of the bridge, streetcar service opened Hayden Island to amusement park developments due to its beaches and strategic location. Jantzen Beach, the last operating amusement park, closed in 1970. Tomahawk Island, just off the east tip of Hayden Island, became another amusement park—Lotus Isle—for a few years in the 1930s.\n\nBecause Oregon does not have a state sales tax, and Washington has one of the higher state sales taxes, it is common practice for people in Southwest Washington to travel to Oregon for larger taxable purchases. The Jantzen Beach Shopping Center and many hotels populate this part of the island. A narrow neck of land connects Hayden Island to Tomahawk Island (not an independent island since construction of the linkage), which has numerous marinas, yacht clubs, and the Yacht Harbor Club apartment community.\n\nThe west side of the island (in unincorporated Multnomah County) is as yet undeveloped, though it was added to the urban growth boundary by voters in 1983. The Port of Portland purchased the land in 1993 with the intention of building a large cargo facility. Metro, the regional government, has designated West Hayden Island as both high value regionally significant habitat and an industrial land. Environmental activists have successfully blocked annexation for industrial development in 1999. But the Port of Portland renewed efforts to annex West Hayden Island in 2008 and Portland City Council voted July 29, 2010 to go forward with an analysis of annexation that would allow for an undetermined port facility and preserve the remaining as a protected natural area.\n\nIn 1792, the island was discovered by Lieutenant William Robert Broughton, commander of the Royal Navy survey brig HMS Chatham, who named it Menzies, after the botanist of his ship Archibald Menzies. (He also named Vancouver after his commander George Vancouver at the same time) In 1805, Lewis and Clark named the island Image Canoe Island after a large canoe carved with images of men and animals emerged from the opposite side of the island.\n\nHudson's Bay Company called it Vancouver Island, and in the early 19th century, it was called Shaw Island for Colonel W. Shaw who owned land on the island. In 1851, the island was renamed for the Oregon pioneer and early Vancouver settler Gay Hayden who owned the island after settling there in 1851 upon hearing of the Donation Land Claim Act a year after it was passed. He built a grand home and lived on the island for five years with his wife Mary Jane Hayden and twin children.\n\nIn 2008, the Port of Portland began exploring and planning the annexation and development of West Hayden Island. The planning process, which is slated to end as early as the end of 2012, would conclude with an annexation agreement that would address recreation, mitigation, land management, habitat preservation, security, repair and improvements of local roads and a community enhancement fund. The proposed plan would develop 300 acres for industrial use and leave 500 acres of natural area untouched. The plan was opposed by environmental groups, such as the Audubon Society of Portland.\n\nThe city of Portland commissioned ECONorthwest to measure the net economic benefits and impacts of the proposed development. The report compared a no-development scenario to the proposed 300-acre development scenario. When accounting for natural resources, recreation, and local and port economic impacts, the report found that the benefits of development were likely to outweigh the benefits of no-development. The analysis also found that the benefits of development were likely to outweigh the costs of development.\n"}

The parish of Gateley is within the Breckland area of Norfolk. The parish lies south-east of the parish of Great Ryburgh and north-west of the parish of North Elmham. For local Government the Village falls in the Upper Wensum Ward of Breckland District Council and the Elmham and Mattishall Division of Norfolk County Council. The river Wensum runs across the north-east of the parish. Nearby villages include Colkirk and Horningtoft.\n\nThe village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The parish name is old English and translates as 'clearing where goats are kept'. This place name and documentary evidence suggests the settlement has been in existence since at least the Late Saxon period.\n\nThe parish church of Gateley is called St Helen's. The nave dates from the 15th century. The chancel is a Victorian rebuilding. The church tower is of the Perpendicular style. There are two shields on south-west buttress. Tower has rectangular vice, the belfry windows have been partly blocked. On south side of the nave is a round headed arch made up of late medieval tiles although the doorway is of late Saxon origins. The south porch has three niches. The church floor has been renewed but is of brick. The primitive font has a marble plinth . There is a rood screen with fine paintings thought to be East Anglia, which are of a local flavour. The Saints chosen for the screen are for local devotions. \nFrom left to right they are Saint Etheldreda, foundress of the Diocese of Ely shown as a nun with a Latin inscription, Scta Adria, or Saint Audrey. Next is Saint Elizabeth, also shown dressed in a nun's habit and her arms crossed as if in an echo of the Visitation, The Blessed Virgin, turned to face her cousin. A third image is of the Mistress of Ridibowne, a local devotion. Virtually nothing is known about her. Ridibowne was probably either Redbowne in Lincolnshire or Redbowne in Hertfordshire.\nOn the other side of the screen are paintings of Saint Louis of France, Henry VI labelled in Latin as 'the Blessed Martyr Henry VI', St Augustine and Sir John Schorne, conjuring the devil into a boot. Sir John Schorne was a clergyman, he is said to be best known for his ability to cure the gout.\n\nGateley Hall is an English Heritage Grade I listed building which was built in 1726, on the site of an older manor house.\n\nThe early Georgian house has double shaped gables at each end. On the south gable is an illegible date plaque thought to be 1726, the plaque is paired by a sundial. The front elevation stands over five bays topped with parapets and is of two storeys. Another architectural feature of the house is the Roman Doric doorcase which has the same slightly chequered brickwork as the gables, but has been cemented over. On the rear elevation there is a round brick projecting bay and a flint bay with small blocked windows. Inside the house the half-turn staircase with landings dates from 1726.

{"id": "2313285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313285", "title": "Robert M. Bell", "text": "Robert M. Bell\n\nRobert Mack Bell (born July 6, 1943) is an American lawyer and jurist from Baltimore, Maryland. From 1996 to 2013, he served as Chief Judge on the Maryland Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. He was the first African American to hold the position.\n\nAt 16 years old, Bell was the lead plaintiff in \"Bell v. Maryland\", a case that ultimately helped push the U.S. toward desegregation. Bell served as a judge at every level of the Maryland court system; and on July 6, 2013, reached the state's mandatory retirement age of 70 years for appellate and circuit court judges.\n\nBorn in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Bell's mother, a sharecropper, moved him and his two brothers to East Baltimore when he was one and a half years old. He attended Dunbar High School with classmate and friend Reginald F. Lewis. As a 16-year-old, he and a group of students participated in a sit-in to protest racial segregation at a local restaurant. On June 17, 1960, the group of 12 students entered Hooper's Restaurant, formerly located at Charles and Fayette Streets in downtown Baltimore, where they were refused service and asked to leave. The students, including Bell, refused. He and the other students were arrested and convicted in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City for criminal trespassing, and fined $10. The NAACP hired a team of lawyers, including Thurgood Marshall and Juanita Jackson Mitchell, to represent the students and appeal the conviction to the Maryland Court of Appeals. The appellants argued that the use of the state's trespassing laws to support segregation of public accommodations violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1962, the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the circuit court.\n\nThe case was then appealed to the U.S Supreme Court, where Bell was represented by Constance Baker Motley and Jack Greenberg. In \"Bell v. Maryland\" (1964), the Supreme Court, noting that in the period since the students' conviction the Maryland General Assembly passed public accommodation laws and Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, refused to rule whether the state's trespassing laws could be used to exclude blacks from public accommodations. The Court vacated the decision and remanded the case to allow the state court to rule whether the conviction should be reversed due to the change in state law. On April 9, 1965, Bell's conviction was reversed by the state Court of Appeals and all of the students were cleared of all charges. The decision of the Supreme Court came just two days after the Senate ended a filibuster and passed the Civil Rights Act. It has been suggested that the Supreme Court refrained from reaching the merits of the case in consideration of the pending civil rights legislation, as had it done so, it would have eliminated the basis for passing the Act.\n\nBell later attended and graduated with a B.A. in history from Morgan State University in Baltimore in 1966 and while there became a brother in Alpha Phi Omega. He then was admitted to Harvard Law School where he earned his J.D. in 1969. That same year he was admitted to the bar and began his legal practice in Baltimore.\n\nIn 1975, Bell was appointed to the District Court of Maryland, District 1, in Baltimore City and served there until 1980. He was an Associate Judge, Baltimore City Circuit Court, 8th Judicial Circuit, from 1980 to 1984 when he was appointed to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. Seven years later he was appointed to the state's highest court and became the chief judge in 1996. He was a member, Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure from 1977 to 1982; Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland, 1980–82; and the Board of Directors, Judicial Institute of Maryland, 1982–84. In August 2006, Bell was named Chair of the National Center for State Courts’ Board of Directors. At the same time, Judge Bell also was named president of the Conference of Chief Justices.\n\nIn April 2013, Bell announced that he would be retiring on July 6, 2013. After reaching Maryland's mandatory retirement age for state judges, 70, Bell retired from his position as Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals on July 6, 2013.\n\nBell has also been the recipient of several awards:\n\n"}

He was trained as a merchant in Braunschweig and studied in Göttingen, Munich and Berlin.\n\nHis career was determined by his engagement in 1841 as tutor in the family of Prince Gallitzin at Moscow, where he gained a thorough knowledge of Russian. This led to his appointment in 1844 as the head of a public school at Tiflis, Governorate of Tiflis (present-day Georgia).\n\nHe took the opportunity of his proximity to Persia to study Persian literature, and translate and publish in 1851 a volume of poetry under the fanciful title, \"Die Lieder des Mirza Schaffy\" (English trans. by Elsa D'Esterre-Keeling 1880). The success of this work can only be compared with that of Edward FitzGerald's \"Omar Khayyám\", produced in somewhat similar circumstances, but differed from it in being immediate. It has gone through 160 editions in Germany, and has been translated into almost all literary languages. The celebrity is not undeserved, for although Bodenstedt does not attain the poetical elevation of FitzGerald, his translation conveys a view of life which is wider, more cheerful and more sane, while the execution is a model of grace.\n\nThough he claimed that the volume was his own poetry published under oriental disguise to gain popularity, it has been argued that the volume was a successful translation of the Persian and Azeri poems of an Azeri poet, and a known acquaintance of his, Mirza Shafi Vazeh.\n\nOn his return from the East, Bodenstedt engaged for a while in journalism, married the daughter of a Hessian officer (Matilde, the \"Edlitam\" of his poems), and was in 1854 appointed professor of Slavonic at Munich. The rich stores of knowledge which Bodenstedt brought back from the East were turned to account in two important books, \"Die Völker des Kaukasus und ihre Freiheits-Kämpfe gegen die Russen\" (1848), and \"Tausend und ein Tag im Orient\" (1850).\n\nFor some time Bodenstedt continued to devote himself to Slavonic subjects, producing translations of Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, and of the poets of Ukraine, and writing a tragedy on the false Demetrius, and an epic, \"Ada die Lesghierin\", on a Circassian theme. Likely finding this vein exhausted, he exchanged his professorship in 1858 for one of Early English literature, and published (1858–1860) a valuable work on the English dramatists contemporary with Shakespeare, with copious translations. In 1862 he produced a standard translation of Shakespeare's sonnets, and between 1866 and 1872 published a complete version of the plays, with the help of many coadjutors.\n\nIn 1867 he undertook the direction of the court theatre at Meiningen, and was ennobled by the duke. After 1873 he lived successively at Altona, Berlin and Wiesbaden, where he died on April 19, 1892. His later works consist of an autobiography (1888), successful translations from \"Hafiz\" and \"Omar Khayyam\", and lyrics and dramas which added little to his reputation.\n\nFrom 1879 to 1880 Bodenstedt traveled through the United States. He published his travel account in 1882 in Leipzig, entitled \"Vom Atlantischen zum Stillen Ozean\" (\"From the Atlantic to the Pacific\").\n\nAn edition of his collected works in 12 vols. was published in Berlin (1866–1869), and his \"Erzählungen und Romane\" at Jena (1871–1872).\n\n"}

With 19 confirmed aerial victories, Edwards is Canada's highest scoring ace in the Western Desert Campaign.\n\nBorn in Nokomis, Saskatchewan, Edwards grew up in Battleford, Saskatchewan. After graduating from St Thomas College in 1940 he volunteered for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF).\n\nSergeant Edwards was posted to 94 Squadron RAF of 223 Wing in January 1942 flying the P-40 \"Kittyhawk\". On March 23, he flew his first operational trip, during which he shot down his first enemy aircraft, a Bf 109. In May, he was posted to 260 Squadron, and saw intensive action for the rest of 1942. By September, he had 6 \"kills\" and was commissioned, actually jumping four grades to Flight Lieutenant[1]. A Distinguished Flying Medal and Distinguished Flying Cross were awarded by the start of 1943, by which time Edwards was a Flight Commander. His tour finished in May 1943, total claims made being 17 aircraft shot down and several ground kills. In fact German records show Edwards underclaimed - 22 victories had been confirmed by German records. One of Edwards' victims during the North African campaign was famous Luftwaffe \"experten\" Otto Schulz (51 victories), who was shot down by the Canadian ace on June 17, 1942. On 3 September 1942 Edwards likely damaged Hans-Joachim Marseille's Bf 109 in combat. Marseille was the highest scoring pilot in North Africa and shot down more Western Allied aircraft than any other German pilot. Three days later he was the pilot believed to have shot down and killed Günter Steinhausen. Though he claimed only a damaged enemy aircraft, it appears this is another victory for which Edwards did not receive full credit.\n\nIn November 1943, Edwards was posted to No. 417 Squadron RCAF, then No. 92 Squadron RAF, flying the Supermarine Spitfire VIII; while serving on the Italian front with 92 Squadron, he added three Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a Bf 109 to his score, all shot down over the Anzio beachhead, three of them on a single day. At the beginning of March 1944, he was posted to the UK, flying operations over Europe with 274 Squadron, a fighter unit equipped, at the end of Edwards' tour, with the Hawker Tempest.\n\nAfter leave in Canada, Edwards returned to the Western Front, flying Spitfire XVIs as 127 RCAF Wing CO in 1945. On May 3, he shared in the destruction of a Ju 88, just a few days before VE. He finished the war with a total of 373 operational sorties without being shot down by the enemy.\nAccording to Shores and Williams' \"Aces High\", his final wartime score was 15 + 3 shared destroyed, with 9 more destroyed on the ground. Brown and Lavigne's \"Canadian Wing Commander\" credits him with 19 victories, 2 shared, 6.5 probable, 17 damaged and 12 destroyed on the ground. During an interview, Edwards himself specified that he had 19 confirmed victories during the war. Many who flew with him have said that he only reported those \"kills\" he was certain of and that his real number of aerial victories was probably much higher than officially reported. Eighteen of Edwards' 19 victories, according to Brown and Lavigne, were enemy fighters (14 Bf 109s, 3 Fw 190s and one Macchi 202).\n\nEdwards stayed in the RCAF until after amalgamation and retired from the Canadian Forces in 1972 as a Lt Col. In that time, he flew Vampires, Sabres and CF-100s both in Canada and overseas. Edwards was a key player in the post-war air force as his experience and leadership was used to train new pilots.\n\nIn 1983, Edwards and Michel Lavigne published a book about his wartime experiences entitled \"Kittyhawk pilot: Wing Commander J.F. (Stocky) Edwards\".\n\nAlso in 2009, Edwards was honoured as one of the 100 most influential Canadians in aviation and had his name included with the others on the 2009 CF-18 Centennial of Flight demonstration Hornet.\n\nAs part of their continued effort to honour and commemorate his achievements (along with those of all veterans), Vintage Wings of Canada has decorated their P-40N in the markings flown by \"Stocky\" in Africa. On September 19, 2009, Vintage Wings took him for a flight over Ottawa in this P-40 giving him a chance to fly it as well.\n\nVintage Wings has also published stories on Stocky Edwards including the following:\n\n\n\n"}

In 2019, the District reported that 13.6% or 505 students received special education services.\n\nIn order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, Franklin Regional School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department.\n\nIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.\n\nFranklin Regional School District received a $1,720,811 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.\n\nThe District Administration reported that 296 or 7.84% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.\n\nIn 2009, the district reported employing 314 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $56,220 and a top salary of $125,843. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. Beginning with the 2009-10 school year the teachers work a 191-day school year with 183 days of instruction. The length of the work day is 8 hours, with a thirty-minute duty-free lunch and a daily preparation period. In 2011, the average teacher salary in Franklin Regional School District was $61,942 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $22,057 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $83,999. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers' total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security.\n\nIn 2007, Franklin Regional School District employed 266 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $55,847 for 180 days worked. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.\n\nFranklin Regional School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $598.97 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union.\n\nIn 2008 the district administration reported that per pupil spending was $11,680 which ranked 319th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010 the per pupil spending had increased to $$12,044.68 which ranked 364th statewide. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759.\n\nReserves In 2008, the district reported a balance of $3,660,707 in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $4,136,639.\n\nIn November 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration.\n\nThe district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth.\n\nIn 2011-12, the district received a $6,497,323, allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $105,339in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 363 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.48% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $7,037,835. Among the districts in Westmoreland County, the highest increase went to Yough School District which got a 7.40% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.\n\nIn the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 3.67% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $6,735,796. Among the districts in Westmoreland County, the highest increase went to Southmoreland School District which got a 6.44%. The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $6,269,051.89. Ninety school districts received a 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 325 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007–2008 school year.\n\nBeginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $285,917 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten and increased instructional time.\n\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. The School District applied to participate in 2006-07 receiving $123,141. In 2007-08 it received $300,000. The district received $25,932 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $449,073. In County the highest award was given to area School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis.\n\nThe district received an extra $2,068,777 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.\n\nDistrict officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.\n\nProperty tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 86.6800 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.\n\n\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.\n\n\nFor the 2012-13 budget year, Franklin Regional School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: teacher pension costs a special education costs. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.\n\nFor the 2011-12 school year, Franklin Regional School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: teacher pension costs and Maintenance of Selected Revenue sources. Each year, the Franklin Regional School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nAccording to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.\n\nFranklin Regional School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.\n\nIn 2010, property tax relief for 7,001 approved property owners of Franklin Regional School District was set at $119. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Franklin Regional School District was also $120 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 6,972 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Westmoreland County, the highest tax relief went to New Kensington-Arnold School District which was set at $350. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. This was the second year they received this amount. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Westmoreland County, 62% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.\n\nProperty taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).\n\nFranklin Regional School District offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities, clubs, and athletic programs that are available to all students in Grade 7 through 12. The district charges a $50 one time annual student participation activity fee. The Student Activity Fee is waived for students who qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch. Franklin Regional School Board has set eligibility requirements: attendance, academics and code of conduct for access to all extracurricular activities.\n\nBy Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This rebel victory had punched a hole in the dragnet the military had attempted to throw around county Wexford and had also yielded them three artillery pieces. The town of Arklow had been evacuated in the ensuing panic but the rebels had contented themselves with taking the town of Gorey and stayed within the Wexford border. On 5 June the rebels attempted to break out of county Wexford across the river Barrow and to spread the rebellion but were halted by a major British victory at the Battle of New Ross. When the rebels finally moved against Arklow, the town had been reoccupied by a force of 1,700 men sent from Dublin under Francis Needham, who quickly fortified the town with barricades and had artillery positioned on all the approaches to the town.\n\nThe rebel army that formed for attack on the afternoon of 9 June was a combined force of Wexford and Wicklow rebels led by Billy Byrne, Anthony Perry, Conor McEvoy, Edward Fitzgerald, and Fr. Michael Murphy. The British in Arklow consisted of ~1000 militia from Amtrim and Cavan and 150 regular cavalry supported by 250 Yeomanry, they were joined by 315 Durham Fencibles arriving an hour before the rebels.\n\nThe area surrounding the town and the approaches was covered by scrub and the rebel strategy adopted was to advance under cover attacking the town simultaneously from several points. Before the action began, the rebels under Esmonde Kyan opened fire upon the town with some of the artillery captured at Tuberneering and had some success by scoring a direct hit on a British artillery position, destroying the cannon and killing the attendant crew. The main assault was quickly launched but at all entry points the Irish were thrown back by the musket fire of the well-trained and disciplined militia and volunteers, and canister shot from the 3 pounder battalion gun brought by the Fencibles. An attempt by the British to turn the Irish failure into a rout was defeated when pikemen and sharpshooters drove a cavalry charge back across the Avoca River, but an attempt to force a way into the town through the outlying fishing port was bloodily repulsed.\n\nAs Irish casualties mounted, the lack of ammunition and proper leadership began to work against them, and after Fr. Murphy was killed leading a charge, their attacks started to peter out. As nightfall came, the rebels began to withdraw under cover of darkness and collect their wounded and were not pursued or molested by the garrison who were, unknown to the rebels, down to their last three or four rounds per man and were themselves at the brink of defeat.\n\nWhile rebel casualties were estimated at about 1,000 no full casualty list seems to exist on the British side, but were probably in the region of 100 dead and wounded. The defeat at Arklow marked the third failure to extend the fight for Irish independence beyond the borders of County Wexford following the other bloody repulses at New Ross and Bunclody. The Irish strategy now changed to a policy of static defence against the encroaching British armies.\n\n\n\n"}

Harrison began writing the song in 1988, during the making of a video for his 1987 album \"Cloud Nine\".\n\nThe only known public performance of \"Any Road\" was in 1997, by Harrison, at the suggestion of Sukanya Rajan during an interview with Ravi Shankar conducted by VH1 (it was the last known filmed performance by Harrison).\n\nThe refrain \"If you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there\" was essentially a paraphrase of an exchange between Alice and the Cheshire Cat in Chapter 6 of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\":\n\n\"Any Road\" was the last Harrison song to be released as a single. The song was released on 12 May 2003 as a single in the United Kingdom and peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Any Road\" was nominated at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, and was also featured on the \"2004 Grammy Nominees\" compilation album.

{"id": "2313296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313296", "title": "Testerton", "text": "Testerton\n\nTesterton is a small village in the English county of Norfolk. It is located between the village of Great Ryburgh and the market town of Fakenham. Any remaining population is included in the civil parish of Pudding Norton.\n\nTesterton is one of a clutch of deserted villages and associated churches within a few kilometres of Fakenham. Testerton currently has only a handful of inhabitants; the civil parish of Testerton was abolished in 1935 and the lands used to enlarge the civil parish of Pudding Norton, another mostly deserted village. \n\nAlthough mentioned in the Domesday Book, Testerton appears to have decayed during the Medieval period, and by the beginning of the 17th century the parish had only 18 communicants. By the end of that century the parish church of Saint Remigius was already very ruined, and at some point after this time the walls were completely removed.\n\nThe only surviving remnant of the medieval village is the church, which retains the western part of the west tower, and is believed to have had a rectangular nave and apsidal chancel. The tower dates to the late 14th or 15th centuries, though the rest of the church is likely to have dated to the 11th or 12th centuries.\n\nApart from the Church of St Remigius, Testerton Hall also presents some architectural interest. The present Grade II Listed house is only the rear service wing of what was once a much larger building, dating to 1802. With two storeys in seven bays, the building is constructed from red brick and has a south facade in the Georgian architecture style.\n\n"}

She is also a human rights activist who introduced the first bill in the history of US Congress to officially recognize International Women's Day in the United States.\n\nPoźniak was born in Gdańsk, Poland. Her mother was born in Wilno, Lithuania and from her father's side, family is from the Ukraine. She passed her entrance exam to the National Film School in Łódź PWSFTViT with the highest score in the country, and received a Master's of Fine Arts degree with High Honors at age 22.\n\nHer very first film role, while still in high school, was as an extra in the Academy Award winning film \"The Tin Drum\" which happened to be filming near her home. She later made many film appearances and worked as a fashion model and was the calendar girl for Poland's national soccer team.\n\nPoźniak was discovered by the U.S. audiences when Oliver Stone cast her in \"JFK\" as Marina Oswald. This memorable role in an Academy Award-nominated film was her U.S. feature debut and it led to her appearances in over 30 film and TV projects worldwide. After playing the first female President of the World, Earth Alliance President Susanna Luchenko in \"Babylon 5\", and a fiery young revolutionary in George Lucas' \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", as well as a sharp scientist Ludmilla in \"Dark Skies\" or Eva in \"Pensacola\" she becomes known for playing badass female characters. Other powerful roles have included Paramount’s \"JAG\" where she appeared as an exotic Israeli spy, a double agent working for the Mossad and CIA. In the television series \"Melrose Place\", she created a ground-breaking character, Dr. Katya Fielding, a \"straight\" woman and mother who decides to marry a gay man - the role that is still very much talked about, making Poźniak one of the show's most popular former cast members. Her other diverse roles include Masha in \"Mad About You\", Raisa on \"The Drew Carey Show\" and Tambor, the Japanese nanny in Oliver Stone's \"Wild Palms\" miniseries. In the CBS movie of the week \"A Mother's Gift\", she was seen as a character that aged thirty years, whereas in a World War II drama entitled “Miriam” she played a Catholic woman who risks her life to save a Jewish girl from the Nazis. She also stars as Laina in the interactive movie/video game \"Psychic Detective\", premiered at Sundance Film Festival as the first video game in the New Media category. An experimental film \"All These Voices\" where she stars as Beata, a World War II Survivor wins a Student Academy Award.\n\nPoźniak narrated the bestseller, \"The Winter Palace: A Novel of Catherine the Great\", a 19-hour audiobook for Random House, where she made use of her European background in bringing to life the 78 characters and their colorful accents. After embodying one of the most intriguing women in history, she read another 19 hour story of the \"Empress of the Night: A Novel of Catherine the Great\". This was followed by a teen romance/adventure/sci-fi thriller, \"The Illuminae Files\", by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, which won an Audie Award. After that, she co-narrated \"The Tsar of Love and Techno\" by Anthony Marra which was selected in the Top 5 Best Audiobooks of the year by The Washington Post. As a producer and narrator she takes on \"Libretto for the Desert – Poetry Dedicated to the Victims of Genocide and War\" a project that acknowledges the universality of loss, persecution, and intolerance. Poźniak received the 2019 Earphones Award for the best read audiobook \"Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\" written by Nobel Prize Winner Olga Tokarczuk. In the video game world, she voiced Skarlet, the Blood Queen in \"Mortal Kombat 11\", which turned out to be the highest-grossing video game of the last decade. She also narrated documentaries such as, \"The Officer's Wife\" about the mass murder of Polish officers in the Katyn forest and co-narrated \"Freedom from Despair\", a film about communism, which won several Awards and received an honorable mention in the US Congress.\n\nSeeking a new voice for herself in a uniquely contemporary style that declares \"anything is possible,\" she founded Theater Discordia. Creating performance-art pieces that have been part of the L.A. Theatre Festival, and the L.A. Poetry Festival, she directed and wrote \"Poeticus Umbilicus\", \"Poetry Discordia\", \"Return of Umbilicus\", \"We & They\" and \"Changing Flags.\" Her Theater Discordia evolved, with the participation of Peter Sellars, into a celebrated venue for experimental theater works.\n\nPoźniak is also a painter, and continues to work in film, often appearing in experimental and independent productions, several of which she has also directed. In her directorial debut, which was a short film, \"Mnemosyne\", she used several art pieces made by herself. Praised by F.X. Feeney LA Weekly: \"the multitalented Pozniak rapidly intercuts news footage of violence with live models and her own sensual sculptures to express a fierce moral sense.\" Through her art, Poźniak often explores what it is to be a woman in today’s world with recurring themes of women's rights, social justice and women's history. Her artworks combine the choreographic traditions of theater with symbolic and surreal imagery of painting and sculpture. In her early mask series, Poźniak connects an ancient and mythological theatrical device with the surrealism of Man Ray to produce a stunning range of fantastical masks made from feathers and other found objects. Her more recent paintings and sculptures explore the collision of ancient myths and the modern world. By combining imagery reminiscent of surrealist dreamscapes with found objects, these works challenge our notions of continuity between past and present. Poźniak says:\n\"Surrealism is a lens through which I view many of the events and circumstances occurring in the world today. Whether it is the horrors of war or inspirational insights found in ancient mythology, I am constantly exploring fantastical juxtapositions that express something about the experience of being a woman. That is why my paintings and sculptures are often surreal and full of symbolism. Feministic, poetical, and political.\"\n\nPoźniak's art is often auctioned off for charity and support different causes including Children's Hospital and Looking Above & Beyond, an organization dedicated to creating awareness and the enrichment of children with special needs or Our House, an organization providing grief support services, education, resources, and hope. She also hosted Domestic Violence Prevention Awards, National Women's Political Caucus's - Women's Leadership Awards.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, soon after her arrival in America, Poźniak began a campaign to get the US Government to recognize International Women's Day. She was very successful, and she accomplished the introduction of the first bill in the history of the U.S. Congress for national recognition of the holiday (H.J. Res. 316) designating March 8 as International Women's Day occurred on 8 March 1994. She made the headlines of the \"Los Angeles Times\", who hailed her as \"Taking the Banner For Women Everywhere\". Furthermore, Poźniak established an educational organization Women's Day USA, which aims to raise a public awareness of women's inspirational achievements all over the world. She also works on projects that help bring awareness to third world issues with a special emphasis on the representation of women's voices and their untold stories.\n\nShe received official recognition from the Los Angeles City Council, which commended her for her efforts in establishing International Women's Day as a day to be celebrated in the United States and from Mayor Richard Riordan for her vision in creating International Women's Day, and from Mayor Tom Bradley for bringing the idea to Los Angeles. Poźniak has been acknowledged for her ability to work across both political parties in seeking greater recognition for women's rights. In 1995, at a public awards event, a women's rights attorney, Gloria Allred acknowledged Poźniak for her contributions to human rights and to women's history and also named Poźniak as being her personal hero. Furthermore, Poźniak established an educational organization Women's Day USA.\n\nIn 1994, to commemorate the introduction of the first bill in the history of the U.S. Congress (H.J. Res. 316) to recognize International Women's Day in the United States, Poźniak created a painting \"Mnemosyne - International Women's Day\", the Mother of Memory which celebrates the many contributions to human rights by women from all over the world. A symbol of International Women's Day, the work depicts a community of all races of the world in a female form. It evokes the achievements of women along their struggle for peace and equality in the face of discrimination and war.\n\n\n\n"}

Written and directed by David Grieco, the film stars Malcolm McDowell, Marton Csokas, and Ronald Pickup.\n\nIn 1984, in Kiev, schoolteacher Andrej Romanovich Evilenko is dismissed from his position after attempting to rape a pupil. Driven by his psychopathic urges and embittered by the collapse of the Soviet Union, Evilenko begins to rape, kill, and cannibalise women and children. It is hinted throughout the movie that Evilenko somehow gained the power to hypnotise his victims, which accounts for their lack of resistance and his continuous evasion of the authorities.\n\nVadim Timurouvic Lesiev, a magistrate and family man, is assigned to catch the serial killer. For years, Evilenko eludes Lesiev and psychiatrist Aron Richter, who is assigned to profile the killer. Richter eventually finds Evilenko with a little girl and manages to break Evilenko's hypnotic hold on her, but is killed by Evilenko in retaliation; although it appears to Evilenko that she is run over by a train, the girl escapes alive.\n\nAlmost ywo years later, Lesiev finally captures Evilenko, who by now has killed 55 people, mostly children and young women. On 22 May 1992, Evilenko goes to court, and on 14 February 1994, he is finally executed. Before his execution, two governments expressed interest in Evilenko's psychic abilities and asked for extradition of Evilenko but were denied.\n\n\nThe story is a fictionalization of the life and crimes of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Large segments of the film were adapted from Grieco's novel entitled \"The Communist Who Ate Children\". The character is renamed \"Andrei Evilenko\" in reference to Chikatilo.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Angelo Badalamenti and features two tracks with Dolores O'Riordan, \"Angels Go to Heaven\" and \"No Way Out\".

Included are tabular presentations of the fleets that participated in the battle, the order in which they sailed and attacked, and a graph of the percentage of casualties plotted for each ship along the three battle columns.\n\nThe Battle of Trafalgar was fought by sailing vessels and therefore cannot be understood in substance except as the manoeuvring of sailing vessels according to the principles of sailing. Without understanding the importance of wind and weather, especially wind direction, the modern can make no sense of the manoeuvring. Once those principles are understood, the plan of battle unfolds in a transparent fashion. The plan is included here as well as its general applicability to real events.\n\nReal battles do not always develop according to plan, or exactly according to plan. Commanding officers usually are empowered to respond to the battlefield situation as it develops. Such concepts as \"sailing order\" and \"battle order\" are constructs. In a column of ships sailing anywhere the first ship forward was Number 1, the second, Number 2, etc. The battle order was based on planned order of attack. Ships were assigned places in these orders by the commander, sometimes temporarily or even extemporaneously.\n\nNelson used the order that was best momentarily. In stormy weather or other adverse conditions the commanders might not be able to control the order. The very term, \"Nelson's fleet\", was a construct. Ships were continually joining or leaving his fleet for various reasons. The complements of the ships also were variable. The early historians of the battle were not sure of what they were, nor did they know exactly what the casualties were. The roster lists of the ships before sailing were generally used. Afterward there were plenty of reports.\n\nThe numbers and orders of this article are based on the figures of modern scholars for the most part. There is general disagreement on the exact order and the exact numbers, but, on the whole, the different estimates are close to each other and can probably be taken as accurate within a few per cent. An effort is made to keep consistency between the tables and the graph.\n\nThe combined French-Spanish fleet left Cadiz Harbour in a loose line and turned to the south along the coast of Andalusia, headed for Naples through the Straits of Gibraltar. They were taking advantage of the north-westerly wind which was blowing on the starboard (right) rear quarter, nearly amidships, pushing them along at a slow rate and causing a swell (waves) perpendicular to the wind direction. It struck the ships from the side, causing them to roll and ruining their stability as gun platforms. The column had a predetermined order, which was necessary for sailing, to prevent some ships from getting between the wind and other ships, \"stealing\" their wind and running the risk of collision.\nThe same wind that was moving the French and Spanish south was also bringing the British north. A sail is basically an airfoil. When full it is curved in such a way as to create a sideways \"lift,\" or force perpendicular to its surface, one component of which is actually against the general direction of the wind. A sailing vessel can thus sail \"into the wind.\" A keel prevents the ship from \"slipping,\" or sliding sideways along the wind. The sails \"are full;\" that is, fully curved, only at certain angles to the wind direction. The angle is adjustable via \"sheets,\" or lines, which generally have to be winched from the deck. The force required is high, giving rise to the idea that one is \"hauling\" the ship into the wind, and therefore the ship is \"close-hauled.\" When not full, the sails flap uselessly in the wind, or \"luff.\" The sailors must then change the angle, or \"trim the sails,\" until they fill.\n\nA square rigged ship cannot sail within 6 points (67.5 degrees) either side of the wind. If the wind is coming from the north, the closest it could sail would be ENE or WNW. In order to travel in that direction, it must \"fall off,\" or move to an angle with the wind on one side or the other, a \"tack.\" A ship tacks back and forth against the wind, or \"beats,\" each tack earning it some \"\". However, because of the huge distance a square-rigger had to travel before it could fill its sails again, tacking would only be done in a dire emergency; where speed of manoeuvre outweighed the enormous risk of being caught in irons. By far the most common way of working to windward was wearing round (gybing). \n\nIn addition, sailing with the wind directly aft (\"abaft\") or directly on either side (\"abeam\") was difficult and inefficient. Sails with the wind in those directions do not fill. The wind must be allowed only from the quarters. At those angles the sails fill and there is a component of force in the desired direction. If the wind is directly abeam, the ship must fall off or close up. The ship may sail on either side of a wind directly astern. A manoeuvre similar to coming about is used to move the wind from one side to another: wearing. The helm is put over, the sails go limp, they are adjusted to fill on the other side. The ship does not have to rotate as far, so the manoeuvre is less disruptive. \n\nWind is everything to a sailing vessel. It cannot move anywhere without it (is \"becalmed\"). If the wind is too great the sails may have to be shortened to present less area, a procedure call \"reefing.\" In a storm the ship must sail close to the wind or have it close astern. As the waves are generally coming in with the wind, a ship sailing close into the wind generally cuts them perpendicularly and only pitches; i.e., drops into the troughs and rises on the crests. A ship with the storm wind abeam is struck longitudinally and rolls treacherously, running a risk of capsizing. To avoid that risk the captain must run before the wind. All directions are evaluated with regard to the wind. The side of a ship toward the wind is called the \"weather\" or \"upwind\" side; away, the \"lee\" or \"downwind\" side (refer to Windward and leeward).\n\nMuch has been made of the tactics of various great sailing captains, but the greatest constraints come from wind direction and relative position. The captain of a steam vessel has considerably more freedom to take his ship where he wishes to take it, but the tactics of a sailing captain are to a large extent already predetermined by nature. To get to any point the sailing captain must plot a course taking wind direction into consideration. He must have judgement and skill, and is evaluated by the men on that skill.\n\nNelson's battle plan is revealed on a surviving \"memorandum\" to his captains scrawled on a sheet of paper. The memorandum was meant to be official, as it is signed \"Nelson and Bronte\" and dated \"Victory, off Cadiz, 9th October, 1805,\" which was 12 days before the battle on the 21st. Nelson and his fleet were patrolling off Cadiz, waiting the exit of a combined French and Spanish fleet. He knew better than to attack a heavily fortified harbour, the most heavily fortified in Spain. Meanwhile Nelson was staying out of sight and out of reach.\n\nSailing ships were not amenable, compared to modern ships, to this type of combat. There were no blitzkriegs of sailing vessels, no sudden marches behind enemy lines to strike from unexpected quarters at unanticipated locations. They moved in slow motion at the mercy of wind and wave. The days of weather analysis and radio reports were far ahead. A fleet of ships could deliver the most fire when it was sailing broadside in a line to the enemy, hence the designation \"ship-of-the-line\" for heavy ships of 50 or more guns. In variable weather, the manoeuvring required to set up a line could cost \"... such a loss of time that the opportunity would probably be lost ...\" While the attackers were manoeuvring, the targets might escape. Nelson therefore, had his fleet sail in order of battle.\n\nIn order \"to make the business decisive,\" Nelson would attack on sight, going directly for the enemy line. This tactic was not standard, but neither was it new or unusual. It did have a drawback. Only the front of the attacking column could engage. Nelson's 27 ships-of-the-line would attack in two columns. If they succeeded in breaking the enemy line, they could then take on the enemy piecemeal. \n\nThe general orders from Nelson were to \"make the attack upon the enemy, and to follow up the blow until they are captured or destroyed.\" If individual ships were momentarily lost in the confusion, they could do no better, said Nelson, than to pull alongside an enemy and fight broadside.\n\nOnce the enemy was in sight, the British fleet would form two columns. The double column would be sailing with the wind on one side, the windward or weather side. The columns were thus described as the \"weather column\" or the \"lee column.\" Nelson would take command of the weather column while his \"second-in-command\" would take the other. The second could act independently. However, at that time Nelson did not know which side would be the weather side. That detail could not be decided until they were on the expected final approach. At that time the second half of the single line would sail along the leeward side of the first.\n\nAs they sailed, the wind could be anywhere on the weather side, from bow to stern. It could not be from a disallowed direction. If, reasoned Nelson, the enemy fleet was first seen to windward, it was probably extended so that the van (front) could not help whatever was behind it. Such a scenario implies the enemy stretched across Nelson’s port bow quarter moving anticlockwise, but he did not know where the wind would be. His column would either be able to fetch the enemy column or not. If not, the opportunity was lost; they would have to fall off to leeward, wear, and come up on the other side, by which time the hoped-for battle would be only a pursuit.\n\nIf they could fetch the enemy on the current tack, they were to turn to port perpendicular to the enemy column (or near it). The lee column would now be facing the enemy’s rear. Taking a bearing on the 12th ship from the end, they were to sail through to it, while the weather column sailed through to the centre. The 20 ships to the front were to be ignored. Nelson hoped to destroy all the ships to the rear before the enemy's van could wear round. They were hoping to capture Villeneuve, whom they supposed to be in the centre. If the enemy van tacked or wore in an effort to stage a rescue, the British fleet would station itself between them and the captured and disabled ships, and defeat them in further battle.\n\nIf on the other hand the enemy fleet was first seen off the lee side; that is, off the starboard bow, the British would be in the strongest position. Turning to starboard they could glide downwind to the enemy and strike him wherever they pleased. Nelson seems to have believed the enemy line would have the same direction of travel, anticlockwise around the British line. Thus the lee line would act by the same instructions, turning to starboard, sail through to the 12th ship from the end.\n\nAs luck would have it, in the real battle, the enemy appeared to the lee. However, they were sailing clockwise around the British fleet, forcing the weather column to attack their rear. The real situation changed rapidly as the enemy column reacted but the direct attack on the centre and doubling of the column were planned and resulted in victory.\n\nThe French and Spanish were crowded into Cadiz Harbour, protected by shore batteries. Nelson entertained briefly a proposal to sail up to the entrance to the harbour and saturate it with the new Congreve Rocket, setting the enemy ships on fire. That is exactly what Villeneuve was hoping they would do. He believed the combined fire of shore and ship was the best chance of destroying Nelson. He delayed, hoping to exploit any impetuosity and impatience the younger commander might evidence.\n\nNelson's link to the enemy was an unobtrusive line of spy ships. The enemy saw only the first in line observing them at a distance. That ship was in signal range of another, which was in range of another, all the way back to Nelson, wherever he happened to be.\n\nHigher-level decisions were being made by Napoleon, who could not wait indefinitely for the opportunity to invade Britain, and who had switched his attention to war on the continent, especially Austria and Italy. He needed Villeneuve in the Mediterranean and issued an order to sail out of Cadiz immediately.\n\nNapoleon however, was not as skilled in naval matters and imagined that a fleet of 40 or so large vessels could leave port in an instant. It could take a considerable time for that many ships to get out of port, even under the best conditions. Moreover, they could not do so without favourable winds. If the winds were fickle, progress would be even slower and if the winds were contrary, the whole operation would be impossible.\n\nTable notes: \n\nThe table below shows the British vessels as they were deployed at a hypothetical moment just prior to engagement. HMS \"Africa\", somewhat detached to the north due to a combination of weather and a missed signal during the night, was supposed to have been fourth from last, in the lee column. The rest of the ships-of-the-line were divided into two columns, with the weather column forming the northern flank and the lee column the southern flank. The enemy line had been sailing north to south in front of the wind. Just as the battle was beginning they turned individually anticlockwise, wore ship, and came into the wind, hoping to bear down on Nelson. The order of British ships in the table is the one of that moment. Prior to closing with the enemy, they were in a single line, and after engagement, the ships manoeuvred to assume the best firing positions. The British fleet of the battle consisted of 33 warships, 27 of which were ships of the line. During the battle the frigates and smaller vessels acted in support but did not engage.\nThe following listing shows the French and\nSpanish ships of the line at some hypothetical moment just before engagement. Prior to then they had been sailing north to south. After wearing, the order of sailing was reversed, so that the former head was now the rear. During the battle itself the entire line broke into small units and individual ships. The combined fleet consisted of 40 vessels with 18 French ships of the line and 15 Spanish ships of the line.\n\nBelow is a graph of the percentage of casualties plotted for each ship along the three battle columns. The graph is a construct only. The losses were incurred throughout the entire battle and after, most while the ships were not actually in that order. The order in the graph is shown as a convenience.\n\nThree columns and a separate ship are shown on the horizontal axis, which represents units of conventional distance between ship positions. All units are assumed to be the same. There are three origin points, one for the beginning of each column and the \"Africa\", which was not in the three.\n\nThe vertical axis shows percentage of casualties per ship. For example, casualties for the \"Victory\" are plotted at 20%. A casualty is someone who was known to have been wounded, someone who was known to have been killed, or someone missing in action and presumed drowned. The percentage is the ratio of casualties to ship's complement multiplied by 100. Casualties continued over the next few weeks as enemy crews rebelled, retook their ships, and were subdued. The graph covers only the main battle on the first day.\n\n\n\n"}

For most of its operational lifetime, the base's mission was to train and support heavy strategic bombing groups and wings.\nCarswell was a major Strategic Air Command (SAC) base during the Cold War. It was the headquarters of several SAC intercontinental bombardment wings, equipped with the latest heavy bombers from B-29 Superfortresses; B-36 Peacemakers and B-52 Stratofortresses. The west side of the airfield was home to Air Force Plant 4, a industrial complex occupied over the decades by Convair, General Dynamics, and now by Lockheed Martin. The bulk of the Air Force Convair B-36, B-58 Hustler, F-111 Aardvark, EF-111 Raven and F-16 Fighting Falcon fleets were built there.\nWith the end of the Cold War, and the subsequent downsizing of the American military, the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommended that Carswell AFB be closed by 1994. Today, the facility is known as Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base. It retains an Air Force Reserve presence as well as a Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve and Air National Guard flying units where were formerly located at Naval Air Station Dallas.\nCarswell Air Force Base was named after Medal of Honor recipient Major Horace S. Carswell, Jr. (1916–1944). Major Carswell was returning from an attack on Japanese shipping in the South China Sea on 26 October 1944. He attempted to save a crewmember whose parachute had been destroyed by flak. He remained at the controls of his crippled bomber and died while crash-landing the B-24 Liberator near Tungchen, China. The base was renamed in his honor on 29 January 1948.\nCarswell's origins date back to the early years of aviation. After the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, General John J. \"Blackjack\" Pershing invited the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to establish training fields in the southern United States where the warmer weather would be more conducive for flying year-round. In June, the War Department inspected 6 sites around Fort Worth, Texas which had been offered by the Chamber of Commerce. In August the War Department signed leases with the RFC on 3 sites around Fort Worth. Known as the Flying Triangle, these sites were Hicks Field (#1), Barron Field (#2), and Benbrook (later Carruthers) Field (#3) based on their locations. In April 1918 these airfields were turned over to the Air Service, United States Army as training fields for American pilots. Hundreds of pilots learned their basic and primary flying skills at these airfields in the Fort Worth area during the war. They were closed in 1919 when the war ended.\nIn 1940 the City of Fort Worth had filed an application with the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), asking for a primary pilot training airfield for the Army Air Corps. In May, General Jacob E. Fickel visited Fort Worth on an inspection visit. Fickel had learned to fly at Carruthers Field in 1918. At the same time, the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce was trying to convince aircraft manufacturers to build an aircraft assembly plant in the area. Consolidated Aircraft, wanting to build in the area, suggested to the Air Corps that they jointly build an airfield adjacent to the heavy bomber plant they wanted to build in Fort Worth. On 16 June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $1.75 million to construct an airfield next to the Consolidated manufacturing plant. The Army wanted to have the airfield ready quickly before the plant was put into production and construction of the \"Lake Worth Bomber Plant Airport\" began almost immediately.\n\nHowever, after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army changed its plans and instead of being an operational base, \"Tarrant Field\", as the facility was called, became a heavy bomber training school. The first unit assigned to the base was the Army Air Forces Training Command Combat Crew School on 1 July 1942. At the same time, the Consolidated plant began assembly of B-24D Liberator aircraft in May, with the first aircraft being assigned to the school in August. On 29 July, the base was again renamed as \"Fort Worth Army Airfield\". \nThe Army Air Forces Combat Crew School (later re-designated Army Air Forces Pilot School, Specialized 4-Engine) took graduates of Training Command's advanced pilot training schools and experienced 2-engine pilots and trained them on flying the B-24 Liberator. The school was officially opened on 12 October 1942 and was under the jurisdiction of the 34th Flying Training Wing at San Angelo Army Airfield, Texas. The school was initially equipped with B-24Ds that were assembled across the runway at Consolidated, later it was upgraded to B-24Es that were manufactured at Consolidated's Willow Run Plant in Michigan, then flown to the Fort Worth plant for final modifications.\nDuring training, nine-member crews were assigned to each plane, and the crews ate, slept and trained together 24-hours a day. This allowed the crew to learn both the technical skills needed for aircraft operation as well as the other crew members minds and reactions. Each day they trained five hours in the air and five hours on the ground. Each class lasted four and a half weeks. Training officials added a Bomb Approach School in October 1943, which incorporated teamwork between a pilot and bombardier. In addition the 9000th WAC Company of the Women's Army Corps were used in the control tower as well as in the communications office of the base.\nIn late 1944, the B-24 training was phased out at Fort Worth AAF, being replaced with a B-32 Dominator Flight Crew Conversion Training School. Training Command instructor pilots were flown to the Consolidated manufacturing plant in San Diego to learn about the Dominator, which was planned as a stablemate of the B-29 Superfortress; much like the B-17 Flying Fortress was teamed with the B-24 Liberator. The first B-32 arrived at Fort Worth in September 1944, however it was in the modification plant until January before it was released to the training school. By the end of 1944, only five production aircraft had been delivered by Consolidated; by comparison the B-29 had been flown in combat for nearly six months. The Army was quite unhappy about the Dominator and the production problems it was experiencing.\nEventually 40 TB-32 trainers were produced for the training program to get underway. Prospective B-32 pilots underwent 50 hours training in the TB-32s and co-pilots received 25 hours of flight time and 25 hours of observer training. Ultimately, a shortage of equipment meant the B-32 training at Fort Worth was never fully realized and after V-J Day, officials eliminated the B-32 training program.\n\nIn November 1945, jurisdiction of Fort Worth AAF was transferred to Second Air Force, which established its 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing at the base, equipped with B-29A Superfortresses. The Air Force had decided to keep Fort Worth as a permanent airfield and in 1946, constructed an 8,200 ft North-South extra heavy-duty runway for future use. The number of completed B-32s at the Consolidated plant had reached 74 production aircraft, along with the TB-32 trainers; many of which were parked at the field. These were ordered flown from Fort Worth directly to storage at Davis-Monthan and Kingman Fields, Arizona for disposal, and the partially assembled B-32 aircraft in the plant were ordered scrapped in place.\nFort Worth AAF was assigned to the newly formed Strategic Air Command in March 1946, and on 1 October 1946, the 7th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy was activated. With its activation, the 7th became part of the Fifteenth Air Force (15 AF), headquartered at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Personnel and aircraft of the new group, consisting of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, were transferred to Fort Worth AAF from the 92nd Bombardment Group at Spokane AAF, Washington. On 1 November 1946, the Eighth Air Force moved its headquarters to Fort Worth AAF from MacDill Field, Florida. \nWith its B-29s, the 7th prepared its people for any combat eventuality that might arise, flying simulated bombing missions over various cities. On 5 July 1947, a flight of eight B-29s of the 492nd Bomb Squadron deployed from Fort Worth AAF to Yokota AB, Japan. Shortly after this the detachment received orders to redeploy to Fort Worth AAF via Washington, D.C. The aircraft left Yokota AB on 2 August, flew over the Aleutian Islands, then into Anchorage, Alaska. From Anchorage the flight flew over Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, turned south and flew over Minnesota and Wisconsin. The bombers flew a low-level flight between The Pentagon and Washington Monument in the Capitol on 3 August. Completing this aerial demonstration, they headed for Fort Worth, landing 31 hours after launch from Japan and covering 7,086 miles.\nOn 12 September, the group deployed 30 B-29s to Giebelstadt Army Airfield, near Würzburg, West Germany. This flight was the largest bomber formation flown from Fort Worth AAF overseas to date, landing in Germany on 13 September. During their ten-day stay, the group bombers participated in training operations over Europe, as well as a show-of-force display by the United States in the early part of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The flight redeployed from Germany on 23 September.\nIn February 1949, a B-50 Superfortress (developed from the famed B-29) and named \"Lucky Lady II\" took off from Carswell for the first nonstop flight around the world. She returned to Carswell after mid-air refueling, flying 23,108 miles, and remaining aloft for ninety-four hours and one minute. \nSince 1942, the XB-36 Peacemaker had been under development by Consolidated, and work on it was shifted from its San Diego, California plant to its government-leased plant in Fort Worth. By 1947 the initial production version B-36A was ready and in June 1948 the first Convair B-36A Peacekeeper was delivered.\nThe first B-36A was designated the \"City of Fort Worth\" (AF Serial No. 44-92015), and was assigned to the 492d Bomb Squadron. B-36s continued to roll out from the production plant throughout 1948 and being assigned to the 7th. The group's last B-29 being transferred on 6 December to the 97th Bomb Group at Biggs AFB. For 10 years, the \"Peacemaker\" cast a large shadow on the Iron Curtain and served as our nation's major deterrent weapons system.\nIn January 1951, the 7th took part in a special training mission to the United Kingdom. The purpose of the mission was to evaluate the B-36D under simulated war plan conditions. Also, further evaluate the equivalent airspeed and compression tactics for heavy bombardment aircraft. The aircraft, staging through Limestone AFB, Maine, would land at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, following a night radar bombing attack on Heligoland, West Germany. From there the bombers would conduct a simulated bomb run on the Heston Bomb Plot, London, finally landing at RAF Lakenheath.\nThis was the first deployment of wing and SAC B-36 aircraft to England and Europe. For the next four days the flight flew sorties out of England. The aircraft redeployed to the states on 20 January arriving at Carswell on 21 January.\nOn 16 February 1951 became a paper organization. With all assigned flying squadrons reassigned directly to the 7 Bombardment Wing as part of the Tri-Deputate organization plan adopted by the wing. The group inactivated on 16 June 1952.\n\nOn 1 December 1948 the 11th Bombardment Group was reactivated by SAC at Carswell AFB and was equipped with B-36s. 7th Bomb Group personnel began training the new 11th group people in the new aircraft and the 11th soon began receiving them.\n\nIn 1947, shortly after the United States Air Force was established as a separate branch of the United States military, the Hobson Wing-Base Organization Plan was implemented. The 7th was selected as one of the \"Test Wings\" to evaluate the new organization T/O and on 17 November 1947 the 7th Bombardment Wing was established. The test was successful and the wing was made permanent on 1 August 1948. As part of the new organization both the 7th and 11th Bombardment Groups became its operational component.\nOn 16 February 1951 the 11th Bombardment Wing was activated and the group was assigned to it. The 19th Air Division was organized the same day at Carswell. With this move the division assumed responsibility over the 7th and 11th Bomb Wings at Carswell.\n\nThe wing's mission was to prepare for global strategic bombardment in the event of hostilities. Under various designations, the 7th Bomb Wing flew a wide variety of aircraft at the base until its inactivation in 1993.\nA five ship B-36 formation was flown on 15 January 1949, in an air review over Washington, D.C., commemorating the inauguration of the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. \nIn 1954, Carswell was prominently featured and used as a filming location in the James Stewart and June Allyson film \"Strategic Air Command\". 11th Bomb Group B-36s appeared with James Stewart who was also attached to the unit in the 1950s as a reserve commander.\nOn 13 June 1955, the Strategic Air Command realigned its three numbered air forces resulting in Headquarters, 8 AF moving from Carswell to Westover AFB, Massachusetts. With that move, Carswell was reassigned under Second Air Force (2 AF), headquartered at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.\n\nOn 16 February 1951 the 11th Bombardment Wing was activated and the group was assigned to it, although all group resources were transferred to the wing until the group was inactivated in June 1952. The wing deployed to Nouasseur AB, French Morocco from 4 May until 2 July 1955. The Wing won the SAC Bombing Competition and the Fairchild Trophy in 1954, 1956 and 1960. 7–11 must have been considered a lucky combination, because the two wings continued to share Carswell Air Force base until 13 December 1957, when the 11th moved to Altus AFB, Oklahoma and began receiving B-52 Stratofortresses.\nDuring January 1958, the wing began transferring its B-36 bombers to various SAC wings. On 20 January, the wing transferred all B-52 equipment and property on hand to the 4123rd Strategic Wing in order to facilitate that organization's conversion, which was scheduled several months ahead of the 7th Bomb Wing at Carswell. On 30 May, Memorial Day, the last of the B-36's in the wing were retired with appropriate ceremonies and \"Open House\". Air Force and civilian personnel of the base, and civilians from surrounding communities were on hand to bid the \"Peacemaker\" a fond farewell. This last flight of a B-36 phased out completely the B-36 program in the wing.\n\nOn 10 December 1957, the 98th Bomb Squadron was detached from the wing and assigned to the newly activated 4123rd Strategic Wing at Carswell. This would become the first Boeing B-52 Stratofortress unit at Carswell. The 7th Bomb Wing officially became a B-52 organization with the adoption of manning documents and equipping authorizations on 1 February 1958.\nOn 19 February 1958, the 4123d Strategic Wing took possession of the first Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on Carswell. At the arrival ceremony on base the bomber was named \"The City of Fort Worth\". It was subsequently assigned to the 98th Bombardment Squadron of the wing. Shortly following the arrival of B-52 bombers to the 4123rd Strategic Wing, the unit was moved to new facilities at Clinton-Sherman AFB, Oklahoma. With the acquisition of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, all new B-52 wings would operate with an air refueling squadron to support those bombers.\n\nAs a result, SAC activated the 7th Air Refueling Squadron at Carswell on 1 April 1958, and assigned it to the wing. The squadron would be equipped with the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker later in the year. With the disestablishment of the Strategic Air Command in 1992, the 7th Air Refueling Squadron and its KC-135As were reassigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the 19th Air Refueling Wing, Robins AFB, Georgia, but remained as Det. 1 at Carswell AFB until the squadron was disestablished later in 1992. Most of the 7th's KC-135As were retired to AMARG, while 55-3130, the oldest KC-135 then flying retired to the Air Force Museum at March AFB, California. A few of the 7th's KC-135As were delivered to Boeing-Wichita at McConnell AFB to be converted to the KC-135R configuration.\n\nIn early 1992, SAC was ordered by AFCOS General McPeak to ground all B-52 Tail Gunners and remove the tail guns from all B-52s that were to remain in the USAF inventory. The 20mm Guns were removed from the Carswell AFB and Minot AFB based B-52Hs, while all B-52Gs kept their quad .50 caliber M-3 BMGs because they were all programmed for retirement to Davis Monthan AFB and its 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309th AMARG).\n\nIn January 1959. B-52s from Carswell were constantly in the air and flying to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.\n\nOn 13 April 1965, the 7 BW deployed its forces to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam to support SAC combat operations in Southeast Asia. Most of the wing's bombers and tankers, along with aircrews and some support personnel, were deployed. At Andersen AFB, the wing flew more than 1,300 missions over Vietnam, and returned to Carswell in December 1965.\nB-52 crews were sent through an intensive two-week course on the B-52D, making them eligible for duty in Southeast Asia. B-52s assigned to combat duty in Vietnam were painted in a modified camouflage scheme with the undersides, lower fuselage, and both sides of the vertical fin being painted in a glossy black. The USAF serial number was painted in black on the fin over a horizontal red stripe across the length of the fin.\nThe B-52 effort was concentrated primarily against suspected Viet Cong targets in South Vietnam, but the Ho Chi Min Trail and targets in Laos were also hit. During the relief of Khe Sanh, unbroken waves of six aircraft, attacking every three hours, dropped bombs as close as from friendly lines. Cambodia was increasingly bombed by B-52s from March 1969 onward.\nRotational deployments to Guam, and also to U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand continued on a reduced scale until 1975. In the 1980s the 7th received several new weapons systems, including modified B-52H aircraft. In 1983, B-52 crews began training with a new weapon system, the SRAM (Short Range Attack Missile) and later, in 1985, the ALCM (Air Launched Cruise Missile). Also, the wing flew numerous atmospheric sampling missions during 1986 and 1987 in response to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident; four B-52H aircraft (s/n 60-0024, 60-0033, 60-0051 and 60-0052) were modified to carry atmospheric sampling pods code-named \"Giant Fish\". These aircraft flew the mission into the 1990s from various bases including Carswell.\nBy 1984 Carswell was the largest unit of its kind in the Strategic Air Command. The 7 BW contributed personnel to Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East in 1991. After an overwhelming victory in the Persian Gulf, the wing returned to Carswell. In September 1991 with the end of the Cold War, President Bush ordered a stand down of all nuclear alert duties.\n\nIn January 1960, the USAF announced its intention to activate the first Convair B-58 Hustler Wing. This was to be the 43d Bombardment Wing, (BW) at that time based at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. The 43rd BW would be moved to Carswell starting on 1 March. The 3958th Operational Test and Evaluation Group (then functioning as an integral unit at Carswell) would be transferred to the 43rd BW upon its arrival. On 1 August 1960, the USAF finally formally assumed B-58 operations responsibility and began testing. 59–2436, the first fully operational Hustler equipped with all tactical systems, was delivered to the 43rd. Two weeks later, the first TB-58A was delivered to Carswell.\n\nAfter July 1961, the wing continued further B-58 evaluations until June 1962. One of its first duties of the 43d was to operate a school to evaluate the new supersonic jet bomber. On 12 January 1961, Major Henry J. Deutschendorf commanded a B-58 crew from the 43rd that set out to break six flight records; five of which the Soviet Union held. The Hustler flew two laps around a course with Edwards AFB, California, at one end and Yuma, Arizona, at the other. The bomber set three speed records over the 1000 kilometer (km) course with a 2000 kilogram (kg), 1000 kg, and 0 kg payload—averaging 1,200.194 miles per hour (mph) in each category. The crew managed an average speed of in each of the same payload categories over the 2000 km course. This flight set the pace for the 43rd with the B-58.\n\nFrom then until the close of 1969 the wing served as one of two SAC B-58 wings with a strategic bombardment mission. One of the last things the wing did while at Carswell AFB took place on 28 March 1964, the day after a major earthquake devastated Alaska. Headquarters USAF tasked the 43rd to provide it with photographs of the region hit by the quake. Members of the 43rd flew two B-58s the to Alaska and back, processed the film, and then delivered the pictures to Washington DC 14.5 hours after the wing received the request. Six months later the 43rd Bomb Wing moved to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas.\n\nIn addition to the SAC units, the United States Air Force Reserve 916th Troop Carrier Group, flew Douglas C-124 Globemaster II aircraft from Carswell. It was activated on 1 April 1963. The group supported missions included military airlift to South Vietnam beginning in 1965 and to U.S. forces in the Dominican Republic during a 1965 crisis. It also participated in numerous humanitarian airlift missions. as well as performed tactical airlift missions within the United States.\n\nBeginning in 1972, the 301st Fighter Wing (under various designations) has trained at Carswell as an Air Force Reserve Command unit, training for tactical air missions, including counter-air, interdiction, and close air support. Originally gained by the former Tactical Air Command (TAC), the unit is now operationally gained by Air Combat Command (ACC).\n\nThe 301st replaced the Air Force Reserve's 916th Military Airlift Group (916 MAG), which was inactivated. The 301st's 457th Tactical Fighter Squadron flew the F-105 Thunderchief from 1972 to 1982. It transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II in 1981, then to the F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1990. The wing has participated in exercises, both within the United States and abroad. It deployed a security police flight to southwest Asia during Operation Desert Storm, January–March 1991, and supported Operation Deny Flight in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. The tail code carried by the present day 457th Fighter Squadron is \"TX\".\n\nCarswell AFB was selected for closure under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 during Round II Base Closure Commission deliberations (BRAC 91). As part of BRAC 91, the decision was made to relocate the 7th Bomb Wing from Carswell AFB to Dyess AFB.\n\nDuring the 1992 Air Force-wide reorganization, SAC was disestablished on 1 June. Carswell and the 7th Bomb Wing were assigned to the newly created Air Combat Command (ACC), and the B-52Hs assigned to the wing were given the ACC tail code \"CW\".\n\nFirst-stage closure activities were initiated in 1992 and B-52H aircraft were relocated to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana by January 1993. The 7 BW was released of all operational capabilities on 1 January 1993, and was transferred to Dyess AFB, Texas without personnel or equipment on 1 October 1993 where it currently flies the B-1 Lancer.\n\nIn 1993, Congress directed the establishment of the nation's first joint reserve base under the Base Realignment and Closure authority. Carswell ceased USAF active duty operations on 30 September 1993, and was transferred to the Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA) for property distribution and reuse.\n\nOn 1 October 1993, the Air Force Reserve's 301st Fighter Wing assumed base responsibilities, establishing Carswell as Carswell Air Reserve Station. The Air Force Reserve's Headquarters, 10th Air Force (10 AF), also relocated to Carswell from Bergstrom AFB, Texas as a result of the BRAC action which closed Bergstrom. The USAF ended operational control of Carswell on 30 September 1994 with the transfer of the property to the United States Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is today a novelist, essayist, journalist and translator, widely published in France, less so in the United States.\n\nIn 2004, Benderson's lengthy erotic memoir \"Autobiographie érotique\", about a nine-month sojourn in Romania, won the prestigious French literary prize, the Prix de Flore. The book was published in the United States (Tarcher/Penguin) and the United Kingdom (Snow Books) in 2006 under the title \"\".\n\nBenderson's book-length essay, \"Toward the New Degeneracy\" (1997), looks at New York’s Times Square, where rich and poor once mixed in a lively atmosphere of drugs, sex, and commerce. Benderson argues that this kind of mingling of classes has been the source of many modern avant-garde movements, and he laments the disappearance of that particular milieu. His novel \"User\" (1994) is a lyrical descent into the world of junkies and male hustlers. He is also the author of \"James Bidgood\" (Taschen, 1999), about the maker of the cult film \"Pink Narcissus\".\n\nA book-length essay by Benderson, \"Sexe et Solitude,\" about the extinction of urban space and the rise of the Internet, was published in French in 1999.

{"id": "2313342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313342", "title": "Inuit grammar", "text": "Inuit grammar\n\nThe Inuit languages, like other Eskimo–Aleut languages, exhibit a regular agglutinative and heavily suffixing morphology. The languages are rich in suffixes, making words very long and potentially unique. For example, in Nunavut Inuktitut:\n\nThis long word is composed of a root word tusaa- – \"to hear\" – followed by seven suffixes (a vowel-beginning suffix always erases the final consonant of the preceding consonant-ending suffix):\n\nNote the consonant sandhi (see \"Inuit phonology\"): The /q/ from -tsiaq- followed by the /j/ from -junnaq- becomes ‹r› , a single consonant taking its point of articulation from /q/ and its manner of articulation from /j/. The /q/ from -junnaq- is assimilated into the /ŋŋ/ of -nngit-, because Inuktitut forbids triple length consonants, and because the morphophonological rules attached to -nngit- require it to delete any consonant that comes before it.\n\nThis sort of word construction is pervasive in Inuit languages and makes it very unlike English. In one large Inuktitut corpus – the \"Nunavut Hansard\" – 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size. This makes the application of Zipf's law quite difficult.\n\nFurthermore, the notion of a part of speech can be somewhat complicated in Inuit languages. Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns. The word ilisaijuq can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb – \"he studies\" – but can also be interpreted as a noun: \"student\".\n\nBecause of the languages’ rich and complicated morphology, this article can present only a limited and unsystematic sample of its features. It is based largely on the Inuktitut dialects of north Baffin Island and central Nunavut. The morphology and syntax of Inuit language varies to some degree between dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to Yupik as well.\n\nInuktitut verbs fall into two major categories with different morphological properties: \"non-specific verbs\" and \"specific verbs\". Many verbs belong in both categories, and can take either set of endings depending on the type of information about the verb's arguments that speakers intend to communicate. Others are restricted to one category or require a morphological change in order to move between categories.\n\nEvery fully inflected Inuktitut verb can act alone as a proposition. No other words are required to form a syntactically correct sentence.\n\nThis section will only cover two of the most common sets of endings for these two verb classes and a small selection of verbal modifiers. Inuktitut has a large and diverse set of verbal inflections, of which this article can only cover a small portion designed to give some sense of how the Inuktitut language works.\n\nNon-specific verbs are verbs that either are \"intransitive\" (they have no direct object), or have an \"indefinite noun\" as their object. In English, an indefinite noun is marked by the lack of the article \"the\" or, if the noun is singular (and countable) the article \"a(n)\". In Inuktitut, when it is the object of a verb, it is distinguished by the use of a non-specific verb and particular suffix described below. A definite noun, in contrast, requires the use of a \"specific verb\" when it is the object of a verb.\n\nAs a general rule, a correctly formed Inuktitut verb must start with a root and end with a suffix that indicates the grammatical person of its subject:\n\nThe indicative is the simplest form of the verb in Inuktitut, and for state verbs - verbs indicating a condition or a situation - this form indicates the present tense: The condition or situation is presently the case. For action verbs, it indicates that the action has recently been completed, mixing tense and aspect. Inuktitut verbs are divided into state verbs and action verbs. However, the distinction may not match how non-Inuktitut speakers would categorise verbs. For example, the verb root pisuk-, meaning \"to be walking\" - is a state verb in Inuktitut.\n\nWhen the verb root ends in a consonant, the suffixes that indicate the grammatical person all begin with t. For example, pisuk- - \"to be walking\" - is conjugated as follows:\n\nVerb roots that end in a vowel have suffixes that start with a j. For example, ani- - \"to go out\":\n\nNote that Inuktitut has a fully productive dual number, present in all three persons.\n\nThere is an alternative form of the above conjugation which is used in different ways and to different degrees depending on dialect. Instead of starting with t after a consonant and j after a vowel, this form starts with p after a consonant and v after a vowel. The exact difference varies from dialect to dialect. In western dialects, including Inuinnaqtun and Inupiatun, only the t/j forms are ever used for statements and the p/v form is rarely if ever heard. In Greenland, only the p/v form is used. In the central and eastern Canadian dialects, both forms are used.\n\nThere are additional p/v forms used in Nunavut to indicate interrogative statements - asking questions - although they may indicate other subtle distinctions of aspect. When they are used to ask questions, the last vowel may be doubled to indirectly indicate rising pitch. So, the question \"\"Are we there yet?\"\" can be written as \"?\" (tikip- - to arrive, and for -pita see the table below) but may also be written as \"?\"\n\nThis way, one can very compactly pose and answer simple yes/no questions:\n\nThe subject of a non-specific verb has no special morphological mark:\n\nThe object of a non-specific verb must end in a suffix that indicates its syntactic role:\n\nThe object of a non-specific verb takes one of the suffixes below, depending on its number:\n\nAn example using the verb taku- - \"to see\" - and inuviniq - \"dead person\":\n\nTo say \"\"I see the dead person\"\" or \"\"I see the dead people\"\" requires a \"specific verb\", which is described in the section below.\n\nSpecific verbs - verbs whose objects are definite as opposed to indefinite - take suffixes that indicate the grammatical person of both the subject and the object, but not their grammatical number.\n\nSpecific verb suffixes used after vowels:\nSpecific verb suffixes used after consonants:\nNote that the suffixes in this table cannot be used for reflexive verbs. That will be discussed separately.\n\nAs with non-specific verbs, specific verbs have an alternate v/p form used to the exclusion of j/t forms in Greenland, to some extent interchangeably in Nunavut, and not at all in the west:\n\nSpecific verb suffixes used after vowels:\nSpecific verb suffixes used after consonants:\nThe specific interrogative is also sometimes used to indicate conditional forms or other aspects. It overlaps heavily with the v/p alternative form described above:\n\nAfter vowels:\nAfter consonants:\nThe subject of a specific verb requires a specific suffix to indicate its syntactic role:\nThe subject of a specific verb takes the following suffixes, depending on its grammatical number:\n\nAll of the suffixes above delete any consonant that immediately precedes them. For example, qajaq becomes qajaup in the singular, qajaak in the dual, and qajait in the plural when it is the subject of a specific verb.\n\nSo, as an example:\nThe object of a specific verb needs no particular suffix at all. Thus, we can contrast Inuviniq takujara - \"I see the dead person\" - with the table for \"non-specific verbs\" above. Continuing the example from above:\nSome verbs are automatically both specific and non-specific verbs, depending only on which suffixes they receive. The verb taku- - \"to see\" - is one example. However, other verbs require an additional suffix to shift classes.\n\nMany action verbs that specifically involve an actor performing an action on another are \"specific verbs\" that take the suffix -si- in order to become \"non-specific verbs\":\nMany verbs of emotion alternate between the suffixes -suk- and -gi- to change whether or not they are specific:\nThis is important when attributing an emotion to a person without designating the cause. To do so, Inuktitut always uses the \"non-specific\" form:\nA reflexive verb is a verb which must have both an object and a subject, but where, in some context, both the object and the subject are identical. In Inuktitut, this situation is expressed by using a \"specific verb\" but by affixing a \"non-specific\" ending to it.\nA verb that has been fully inflected as described above is a complete proposition able to stand on its own. However, when clauses are linked in Inuktitut, a number of other morphosyntactic phenomena come into play.\n\nFirst, many secondary structures use other classes of verb suffixes that those used in main clauses. This article cannot cover the whole of Inuktitut morphology, especially since each class of inflexion has its own set of non-specific and specific endings and they vary significantly from dialect to dialect. The examples below are based on the North Baffin dialect.\n\nIn secondary clauses, third person inflexions must make a distinction between instances where the two clauses have the same subject and those where the subject is different. In English, the sentence \"\"He is leaving because he is tired\"\" is ambiguous unless you know whether or not the two \"\"he\"\"s refer to different people. In Inuktitut, in contrast, this situation is clearly marked:\n\nThe set of suffixes used to indicate the other third person is sometimes called the third person different, but is also often called the fourth person. This additional grammatical person is a pervasive feature of Inuktitut.\n\nThe causative is used to link propositions that follow logically. It is much more broadly used in Inuktitut than similar structures are in English. The causative is one of the most important ways of connecting two clauses in Inuktitut:\n\nThis structure has a meaning closer to an \"\"if... then...\"\"' sentence in English than the kind of structure usually referred to as \"\"conditional\"\". It generally involves using an additional marker of the future tense or the conditional mood in the main clause:\n\nThe frequentative endings indicate that two propositions routinely occur together. In English, this is expressed with words like \"usually\", \"often\", \"generally\" and \"whenever\". It generally involves using an additional marker in the main clause to indicate frequency:\n\nThe dubitative suffixes express uncertainty or disbelief about a proposition:\n\nIn addition to root verb morphemes and inflexions to indicate the number and person of the arguments, Inuktitut has a large inventory of morphemes that modify the verb and may be placed between the root morpheme and inflexions, or at the end of the inflected verb. In pedagogic and linguistic literature on Inuktitut, these infix morphemes are often called verb chunks. These modifiers indicate tense, aspect, manner and a variety of functions that in English require auxiliary verbs, adverbs, or other structures.\n\nThis section can only list a small selection of the many verb chunks, in order to give a sense for how the system works:\n\nWhile Indo-European languages tend to make tense distinctions in terms of before or after some reference event, Inuktitut makes a number of somewhat fuzzy distinctions depending on how far into the past or the future the event took place. In English, this distinction requires additional words to place the event in time, but in Inuktitut the tense marker itself carries much of that information.\n\nInuktitut marks the subject of a non-specific verb and the object of a specific verb in the same way - the absence of a specific morphological marker - and marks the subject of a specific verb and the object of a non-specific verb with particular morphological elements. This kind of morphosyntactic structure is often called an ergative structure. However, ergativity in its most clearly defined instances is primarily about transitive and intransitive verbs. This dichotomy is not identical to the specific/non-specific verb distinction in Inuktitut, since Inuktitut usage is also concerned with the definiteness of the objects of verb,\n\nConsequently, the application of the notion of ergativity to Inuktitut, and to many other languages, is somewhat controversial. Regardless, by analogy with more conventionally ergative languages, the -up, -k, -it endings described above are often called \"ergative suffixes\" which are taken to be indicative of the \"ergative case\", while the -mik, -rnik, -nik endings (see Non-specific verbs - Objects) are called \"accusative\". This usage is often seen in linguistics literature describing Inuktitut, and sometimes in pedagogic literature and dictionaries, but remains a quite foreign vocabulary to most Inuit.\n\n\n\n\"Although as many of the examples as possible are novel or extracted from Inuktitut texts, some of the examples in this article are drawn from \"Introductory Inuktitut\" and \"Inuktitut Linguistics for Technocrats\".\"\n\nDictionaries and lexica\n\nWebpages\n"}

The overall crime rate is low by North American and West European standards and has shown a general decline since the mid-1960s. The incidence of violent crime is especially low, due mainly to pervasive social pressure and conditioning to obey the law. Problems of particular concern are those associated with a modern industrialized nation, including juvenile delinquency, traffic control, and white-collar crime.\n\nCivil disorders occurred beginning in the early 1950s, chiefly in Tokyo, but did not seriously threaten the internal security of the state. Far less frequent after the early 1970s, they were in all cases effectively countered by Riot Police Unit, efficient and well-trained police units employing the most sophisticated techniques of riot control.\n\nJapan's police are an apolitical body under the general supervision of independent agencies, free of direct central government executive control (\"cf.\" National Police Agency). They are checked by an independent judiciary and monitored by a free and active press. The police are generally well respected and can rely on considerable public cooperation in their work. While police are well-trained, they generally have little practical experience outside of writing tickets or answering an occasional domestic dispute.\n\nWhen a person is suspected of a crime, the police can hold him for up to three days before initiating an investigation. The police must obtain approval from the prosecutor's office for a ten-day investigation. If, after ten days, the police are not satisfied with the investigation, they may request an additional ten days from the prosecutor and a judge. These requests are rarely denied. Bail is rarely granted during this time, and only during extreme mitigating circumstances, as when a child or elder relative depends on the suspect for daily care. After the second ten-day period, the prosecutor must bring an indictment against the suspect or release him. Anybody can be arrested, and held for up to 23 days before being charged with a crime.\n\nWhen a suspect is arrested, he is informed of two rights, analogous to Miranda rights. The first is the right to remain silent. The second is the right to have an attorney at the trial. The suspect does \"not\" have the right to see an attorney before trial or have one present during interrogation sessions. If a suspect can not afford an attorney, one will be appointed for him (The Constitution of Japan, Section 37-3).\n\nProsecutors in Japan do not generally go to trial unless they have overwhelming evidence of guilt. Because of this tendency, they decline to prosecute nearly a quarter of all cases. For those that go to trial, Japanese prosecutors hold a conviction record of about 98%. These patterns contribute to public perceptions of the infallibility of the police and the legal system, and the perception that if a person is arrested, he or she must be guilty of the crime.\n\nOfficials involved in the criminal justice system are usually highly trained professionals interested in preventing crime and rehabilitating offenders. They are allowed considerable discretion in dealing with legal infractions and appear to deserve the trust and respect accorded to them by the general public. Constitutionally guaranteed rights of habeas corpus, protection against self-incrimination, and the inadmissibility of confessions obtained under duress are enforced by criminal procedures. \n\nThe prison system is generally modern and conducted from the viewpoint of resocialization. Prisoners are treated on an individualized basis, and education is emphasized. Special attention is given to juvenile offenders, who are normally housed separately from adult prisoners. A well-organized parole and probation program employs numerous citizen volunteers.\n\n\n"}

It comprises extensive mudflats, reed beds, and freshwater marshes in the floodplain of the Sapta Kosi River, and ranges in altitude from . It was established in 1976 and designated as a Ramsar site in December 1987.\n\nDuring 1997 to 1998, an interview survey was conducted in the Paschim Kasuha VDC adjacent to the east of the reserve to investigate the extent of park–people conflict. The findings showed that wild water buffalo and wild boar were major crop raiders between September and February. Large numbers of cattle were found grazing freely inside the reserve. Local people are responsible for illegal utilization of forest products, poaching and river fishing inside the reserve.\n\nIn 2005, the reserve together with the Koshi Barrage was identified as one of 27 Important Bird Areas of Nepal.\n\nThe vegetation of the reserve is mainly characterised by mixed deciduous riverine forest, grasslands and marshy vegetation. The coverage of grasslands is 68%, compared to only about 6% of forest, which is predominated by Indian rosewood. Patches of catechu forest are more prevalent towards the northwestern part. The grasslands near the running water bodies are maintained by the annual flooding and grazing by wildlife. The Sapta Koshi River, a tributary of the Ganges, causes rapid and intense flooding during the rainy season. In the extensive wetlands, 514 plant species are found including kapok, sugarcane, reed, cattail, \"Imperata cylindrica\", eel grass, and species of \"Eichhornia\", \"Hydrilla\", \"Azolla\" and lotus.\n\nA wide range of animals inhabit the protected area. In its water courses and ponds, 200 species of fish have been recorded, most of which are resident. Two toad species, nine frog species, six lizard species, five snake species and eleven turtle species are recorded. Gharial and mugger crocodile occur as well.\n\nThe 31 species of mammals recorded include the Asian elephant, spotted deer, hog deer, wild boar, smooth-coated otter and golden jackal. The Ganges river dolphin has been sighted in the Koshi River. Gaur and blue bull have declined in numbers. Nepal’s last remaining population of about 150 wild water buffalo inhabit the area. This population has now grown to a total of 432 individuals with an annual growth rate of 7.27 percent, according to the latest census carried out in 2016. With this upsurge in the population, authorities are planning a possible transfer of some wild water buffaloes to the flood plains of Chitwan National Park where they have been extirpated around 1950's. If the proposed translocation happens, this will present a natural Predator-Prey scenario since wild water buffaloes in Koshi Tappu has been lacking their natural predators in the form of tiger, leopard and dhole for quite a long time.\n\nNotable among the 485 bird species are watercock, Indian nightjar, dusky eagleowl, black-headed cuckooshrike, whitetailed stonechat, striated grassbird, large adjutant stork, Pallas’s fish eagle, common golden-eye, and gullbilled tern. Swamp francolin and rufous-vented grass babbler occur as well.\n\nIn spring 2011, 17 Bengal floricans were recorded from nine different sites along a north-south stretch of the Koshi River. Seven were males and 10 were females. Only five individuals were recorded outside the reserve, two pairs north of Koshi Tappu, and one female seen twice near the Koshi Barrage area.\n\n"}

He moved to New York City to attend college at the School of Visual Arts, where he majored in cartooning. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991.\n\nAfter graduating from SVA, Jimenez was hired by DC Comics Creative Director Neal Pozner at age 21, with his first published work illustrating four pages in the 1991 miniseries \"War of the Gods\". Pozner was HIV-positive when he and Jimenez started dating, and was hesitant about dating someone younger and HIV-negative. Nonetheless, Jimenez became both Pozner's partner and caretaker, saying:\n\nFollowing Neal Pozner's death in 1994, Jimenez wrote and illustrated the 1996 DC miniseries, \"Tempest\", based on a character from Pozner's late-1980s \"Aquaman\" series. In the last issue, Jimenez dedicated the miniseries to Pozner, and wrote an editorial page in which he came out publicly for the first time. \"It got over 150 letters,\" he says, \"including the classic letter from the kid in Iowa: 'I didn't know there was anyone else like me.' That's what counts. It meant a lot to people.\"\n\nMuch of Jimenez's work is related to works by George Pérez, whose art strongly influenced Jimenez. Jimenez has worked on several \"Teen Titans\"-related series (some issues of the ongoing series \"New Titans\" and \"Team Titans\", and the miniseries \"JLA/Titans\", \"The Return of Donna Troy\" and \"Tempest\"), was the main artist of \"Infinite Crisis\", a sequel to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", and did a long run as writer/artist of \"Wonder Woman\" beginning with issue #164 (Jan. 2001). Pérez had worked on the series in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Pérez and Jimenez would also co-write a two–part story together in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 2) issues #168–169 in 2001. Jimenez would leave as series writer/artist with issue #188 in March 2003. Jimenez and Pérez also have worked together in 2005–2006 in the miniseries \"Infinite Crisis\" (where Jimenez was the main penciller, and Pérez drew some sequences and covers for the series) and \"DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy\" (written by Jimenez and inked by Pérez).\n\nJimenez is also known for his work on various titles for DC Entertainment's \"mature readers\" imprint, Vertigo, including \"Swamp Thing\", \"The Invisibles\" with writer Grant Morrison, and his own creator-owned series, the sci-fi/fantasy mashup \"Otherworld\". In 2003, Jimenez drew several story arcs of Morrison's \"New X-Men\" run.\nIt was announced at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con that Jimenez had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics. He was one of the four artists working on Marvel's flagship title, \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", the company's sole Spider-Man title, in which Marvel upped its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurated the series with the \"back to basics\" story arc \"\" at the beginning of 2008. His first work on Spider-Man was in the \"Free Comic Book Day 2007: Spider-Man\" #1 (June 2007) comic book, with writer Dan Slott, which served as a prelude to \"Brand New Day\". Jimenez and writer Bob Gale co-created the Freak in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #552 (March 2008). Ana Kravinoff, the daughter of Kraven the Hunter, was introduced in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #565 (September 2008) by Jimenez and Marc Guggenheim. During his run, Jimenez drew the cover for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #583, featuring Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2009, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada announced that Jimenez would become the artist of \"Astonishing X-Men\" beginning with issue #31. Jimenez co-wrote the book \"The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia\" with John Wells for Del Rey Books in 2010 and updated through Random House in 2015. He later returned to DC Comics, illustrating a brief stint on \"Adventure Comics\" featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, and \"Fairest\", a spin-off of Bill Willingham's series \"Fables\".\n\nHe appeared at the White House for the National Design Awards to present original art to First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nJimenez appeared in a panel discussion on diversity in sci-fi/fantasy fandom in the March 19, 2015 episode of the Comedy Central humor and commentary program \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\", along with Marvel Comics' director of content and character Sana Amanat, hip-hop artist Jean Grae and comedian Mike Lawrence. During the discussion, Jimenez commented, \"It feels strange to me that we would partition race, gender and nerd as if they were distinct things...All human beings are this combination of experiences and ideologies...Everybody's get some nerd in them. But the idea that, somehow, being a nerd is separate from one’s religious or moral or political beliefs is strange to me. We all bring everything to our decision-making on a daily basis.\"\n\nAs part of the DC Rebirth relaunch of DC's titles, Jimenez was the writer and artist of the \"Superwoman\" series from 2016 to 2017. He got involved with Rebirth when he was originally assigned to be the artist of \"Superman\" but after DC changed their publishing plan, he was asked to work on \"Superwoman\". Jimenez uses his own experiences and emotions and projects them onto the characters in his work. He uses the anxiety he experienced with his mother's death to relate to how Lana Lang deals with her losses. In addition, Jimenez wanted to create a female villain who was not sexually charged, and was motivated by something other than baby-making.\n\nA diorama enthusiast, Jimenez teaches a life drawing course as part of the undergraduate cartooning program at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, where he himself once studied. He has held figure drawing classes outside of SVA, at places such as the LGBT Center in the West Village.\n\nJimenez provided sketches seen in the 2002 superhero film \"Spider-Man\". In scenes in which Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, is seen creating sketches of his costume, the close-ups of his hands are actually those of Jimenez.\n\nJimenez created art for the first permanent AIDS awareness exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. His art has appeared on album covers and in editorial magazines. His artwork has been featured in mainstream publications such as \"TV Guide\", and he himself has been profiled or recognized in \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"The Advocate\", \"Instinct\" magazine and \"Out\" magazine.\n\n\nJimenez came out as gay in 1992, and his first public relationship was with Neal Pozner, who hired him at DC that same year.\n\nAs artist unless otherwise noted.\n\nInterior art\n\nCovers only\n\n\nInterior art\n\nCovers only\n\n"}

{"id": "2313385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313385", "title": "Five Points Gang", "text": "Five Points Gang\n\nFive Points Gang was a 19th-century and early 20th-century criminal organization, primarily of Irish-American origins, based in the Sixth Ward (The Five Points) of Manhattan, New York City. In the early 19th century, the area was first known for gangs of Irish immigrants. Their descendants gradually moved out, to be followed by the next immigrants.\n\nPaul Kelly, born as Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli, was an Italian American who founded the Five Points Gang, one of the dominant street gangs in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Over the years, Kelly recruited youths who later became prominent criminals, such as Johnny Torrio, Al Capone and Lucky Luciano.\n\nThe area of Manhattan where four streets – Anthony (now Worth), Cross (now Mosco), Orange (now Baxter), and Little Water (now nonexistent) – converged was known as \"The Five Points\". Mulberry, notorious for slum tenements, was one street down from the Five Points. This area, now the present-day location of Chinatown, lay between Broadway and the Bowery. By the 1820s, this district had been a center of settlement for poor immigrants and was considered a \"slum\" area of run-down wood frame and brick dwellings, warehouses and commercial enterprises dating from the late 18th century colonial era and early 19th century populated by mostly poor English and Scots-Irish with increasing torrents of waves of Irish refugees by the 1840s. \n\nGambling dens and brothels were numerous in the Five Points area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged, particularly at night. In 1842, famous British author Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the poor living conditions in substandard housing.\n\nIn the pre-civil war era, immigrants often dealt with prejudice and class discrimination from the Nativist White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, as a result, many Irish immigrants had formed local street gangs such as the Kerryonians, Forty Thieves, Shirt Tails, and Chichesters, to rebel against their low social status but the members soon turned to crime to relieve their frustration and make money to support themselves, and their families. Shortly before the American Civil War, these gangs began to dissipate with remaining members joining powerful gangs such as the Dead Rabbits and the Whyos. Eventually the influence and numbers of these Irish gangs gradually started to wane.\n\nBy the 1870s a new wave of now Italian and Eastern European Jewish immigrants were settling into the area. Criminal gangs of Irish, Jewish and Italian criminals began competing for control of the territory, rackets and revenue to be made from illicit activities. Monk Eastman's Eastman Coin Collectors originally had many Irish members.\n\nThe 2002 film \"Gangs of New York\" is set in Five Points based on Herbert Asbury's historical novel portraying the strife from the 1840s to the Civil War draft riots of 1863 between old line Americanized Protestant English and Scots-Irish immigrants and newly arrived persecuted Roman Catholic Irish with riots, crime, poverty and exploitation by political machines like Tammany Hall.\n\nItalian American Paul Kelly (born Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli), formed the Five Points Gang, then made up mostly of Italians. The gang would then gain more power and members when Kelly recruited the remaining members of other Five Points gangs, such as the Dead Rabbits and Whyos, into his growing gang. As time went on, Jewish, Polish and Eastern European immigrants would also be brought within the ranks of the Five Points Gang, making them even more powerful and influential. During the gang's later years, Kelly's second-in-command John Torrio, helped form a national crime syndicate in the United States. The Five Points Gang had a reputation for brutality, and in battles with rival gangs, they often fought to the death. Kelly and Torrio recruited members from other gangs in New York to join the Five Points organization. Al Capone came from the James Street gang, and would later lead the Chicago Outfit. Torrio was the first to establish his style of racketeering in Chicago, and recruited Capone to join him there. Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, also joined the Five Points crew, and was later considered the most powerful criminal in the country.\n\nAs the Five Points Gang became more experienced, Kelly and his lieutenants saw the money to be made by supporting corrupt politicians in their election bids. By threatening voters, falsifying voter lists and stuffing ballot boxes, the gang aided city officials of the Democratic Party political machine like in the era of Tammany Hall to retain power. At the turn of the 20th century, the only competitors to the Five Pointers were from Monk Eastman's gang. \n\nThe rivals disputed claims to a strip of territory of the Lower East Side in Manhattan. In 1901, a Five Pointer shot Eastman in the stomach, but he survived. Soon after, one of his crew killed a Five Pointer in retaliation. By 1903 the feud escalated, and the two gangs openly engaged in warfare. In one incident Kelly, Torrio and 50 Five Pointers were in a gun battle with a similarly sized force of Eastman's gang. City Police called to the scene had to retreat from the battle, which lasted several hours. Three men were killed, and many were wounded in the battle. When the police finally gained control of the situation, they arrested Eastman, but he spent only a few hours in jail. A Tammany-controlled judge released him after Eastman swore that he was innocent. \n\nThe general public was angered about warfare in the streets. A Tammany Hall deputy named Tom Foley brought Kelly and Eastman together and told them that neither would receive any political protection if they did not resolve the border dispute. They restored peace for a short time, but within two months, violence had risen again. Officials brought together the two leaders but asked them to take on each other in a boxing match, with the winner's gang to take the disputed territory. \n\nOn the appointed day, hundreds of men from both sides met at an abandoned house in the Bronx. Eastman and Kelly fought each other viciously. Kelly had been a boxer in his younger days, and was said to make a better showing in the earlier rounds, but Eastman was a larger man and fought ferociously. The fight lasted two hours and by the end of the match, both had suffered heavy punishment but neither man had been knocked out, and the match was declared a draw. The gang leaders told their men that they were still at war. \n\nAt this point, the Tammany Hall bosses decided to back the Five Points crew, and to withdraw any legal or political help to Eastman and his gang. In 1904 Eastman was beaten unconscious by a policeman who had foiled a robbery in progress. Eastman was convicted of the crime and sentenced to a 10-year term in Sing Sing prison (Ossining Correctional Facility) in Ossining, New York. His successor Max \"Kid Twist\" Zwerbach was murdered in 1908 by hitmen of the Five Points Gang, allegedly at the behest of Paul Kelly, and the Eastman crew began to crumble.\n\nPaolo Vaccarelli/Paul Kelly survived an attempt on his life, after being shot three times by two of his lieutenants, James T. \"Biff\" Ellison and Pat \"Razor\" Riley, in a gun battle inside one of his nightclubs. Tammany Hall pressure made him keep a lower profile after this incident. He became more involved in the nascent labor union rackets. He died of natural causes in 1936. \n\nGradually the Mafia gangs took over the rackets and criminal activities formerly controlled by the Five Points Gang. Former Five Pointers such as Torrio, Capone, Lansky and Luciano became the leaders of the new groups and, with mentoring from influential businessman and criminal genius Arnold Rothstein, expanded their operations on a national and international basis. With the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act establishing Prohibition in 1920, profits from bootlegged liquor became a huge source of revenue for the Mafia families.\n\n"}
{"id": "2313391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313391", "title": "The Farnsworth Invention", "text": "The Farnsworth Invention\n\nThe Farnsworth Invention is a stage play by Aaron Sorkin adapted from an unproduced screenplay about Philo Farnsworth's first fully functional and completely all-electronic television system and David Sarnoff, the RCA president who stole the design.\n\nOn April 29, 2004, New Line Cinema announced they had acquired the drama script \"The Farnsworth Invention\" from award-winning writer Aaron Sorkin. Thomas Schlamme was set to direct.\n\nThe release read in part: \"\"The Farnsworth Invention\" tells the story of Philo Farnsworth, a boy genius born in Beaver, Utah, who later moved to Rigby, Idaho, where he began experimenting with electricity. In 1920, when Farnsworth was 14, he showed his high school chemistry teacher a design he had made for an electronic television only to become involved in an all or nothing battle with David Sarnoff, the young president of RCA and America's first communications mogul.\" Schlamme described the movie as \"a classic American tale driven by the conflict between a Mormon farmer and a Russian immigrant over the ownership of the most influential invention of the 20th Century.\"\n\nFollowing its initial press release, New Line did not disclose any additional information about the film. As a result, websites such as the Internet Movie Database incorrectly anticipated a film in 2005. IMDb eventually removed the entry.\n\nIn 2005 it was announced that Sorkin was adapting the screenplay for the stage and the play would debut in the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. It was staged at the La Jolla Playhouse from February 20 - March 25, 2007 as \"a page-to-stage production\" with Jimmi Simpson (\"Zodiac\") playing Farnsworth and Stephen Lang (\"Gods and Generals\", \"Avatar\") as Sarnoff. Award-winning composer Andrew Lippa penned 45 minutes of music to underscore the drama.\n\nIt was scheduled to open on Broadway on November 14, 2007, but this was delayed due to the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike. It opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3, 2007, with Hank Azaria in the Sarnoff role due to Lang's commitment to James Cameron's 2009 film \"Avatar\".\n\nThe show closed on March 2, 2008.\n\nAn Australian production directed by Louise Fischer officially opened on July 13, 2011 at the New Theatre in Newtown.\n\nThe play is not historically accurate, and is an intentional alteration of the story. It shows Farnsworth as being defeated legally by Sarnoff, and then spending his life in obscurity. In reality, Farnsworth won the lawsuit, later received a $1 million payment from RCA for the purchase of his TV patents, and went on to have an illustrious career in technological research. There is a statue of Farnsworth in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThis issue was later addressed on a Facebook question where Sorkin wrote:\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Ben Brantley panned the play with faint praise:\nIn the \"New York Post\", Clive Barnes awarded it 2½ out of 4 stars and stated, \"Sorkin's take on the Farnsworth/Sarnoff standoff would be better suited to a screen, either big or small. Even now, while crackling with crisp dialogue, \"The Farnsworth Invention\" often has the air of a clumsy stage adaptation of, say, \"Citizen Kane\".\" \n\nJoe Dziemianowicz of the \"New York Daily News\" described it as \"disappointing and ho-hum\" and \"seldom deeply involving . . . Scenes play out like brief vignettes from a History Channel biopic . . . without stirring emotions.\" \n\nIn \"Newsday\", Linda Winer called it \"vintage Sorkin and crackling prime-time theater . . . breezy and shrewd, smart-alecky and idealistic.\" \n\nIn \"Variety\", David Rooney said, \"The plot-heavy drama is light on fully fleshed-out characters or subtext, making it likely to play more satisfyingly when it inevitably reverts to being a film or cable project . . . [it] never fully moves beyond its stream of over-explained factoids.\" \n\nIn the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Hedy Weiss described it as \"a firecracker of a play in a fittingly snap, crackle and pop production under the direction of Des McAnuff, the drama has among its many virtues the ability to make you think at the same time that it breaks your heart.\" \n\nChris Jones of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called it \"slick yet deeply conflicted\" and \"restless\" and added, \"this is one of those Boomer-friendly, media-savvy, self-aware pieces of effective theater that feel like they owe a lot to TV writing and our celebrity-obsessed culture . . . this is a jumpy piece of writing. It feels like the writer is worried the audience might change the channel. That's not entirely a bad thing. As fans of Sorkin's TV shows know well, the internal psyche of Sorkin is a very stimulating place in which to dwell for a couple of hours.

He fought in the second highest juryo division for seven tournaments before retiring from sumo in July 1987.\n\nOriginally a Japan Pro-Wrestling trainee, he was transferred to the AJPW Dojo upon JPW's disbanding. He debuted in a tag team match for All Japan Pro Wrestling on January 2, 1988, teaming with the legendary Giant Baba against Buddy Landel and Paul Harris. As with Genichiro Tenryu, Hiroshi Wajima and Arashi before him, his debut was much hyped. Throughout the years he became one of AJPW's top stars, by winning titles such as the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship and the 1996 Champion Carnival.\n\nHowever, he became better known for tag team wrestling. He won his first championship, the All Asia Tag Team Championship, with Shinichi Nakano on June 5, 1990. He won the World Tag Team Championship for the first time on March 4, 1992, teaming with Jumbo Tsuruta. He formed a tag team with Toshiaki Kawada, called The Holy Demon Army, a team which ended up holding the World Tag Team Championship 6 times. The team split when Taue left AJPW for Mitsuharu Misawa's new Pro Wrestling Noah promotion in August 2000, while Kawada decided to stay.\n\nIn Noah Taue continued tag team wrestling, teaming mostly with Takuma Sano. On November 5, 2005, Taue was able to defeat Takeshi Rikio with his Ore ga Taue finisher to capture the GHC Heavyweight Championship, which he held into the new year before losing it to Jun Akiyama on January 22, 2006.\n\nOn June 27, 2009, following the June 13 death of Mitsuharu Misawa, Akira Taue was appointed as the new president of Pro Wrestling Noah. On May 12, 2013, Taue announced that he would be officially retiring from the ring in December. On December 7, 2013, Taue wrestled his retirement match, where he, Takeshi Morishima, Takashi Sugiura, and Genba Hirayanagi defeated Genichiro Tenryu, Tatsumi Fujinami, Masao Inoue, and Kentaro Shiga, with Taue pinning Inoue for the final win of his career.\n\nTaue served as the Noah president until November 1, 2016, when the company was sold to IT development company Estbee, after which he was given the new role of an advisor. He would resign from his position in February 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, after studying with Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, Taue opened his own steakhouse in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan, called Steak Izakaya Champ, where he personally cuts and cooks the steak, as well as greeting customers.\n\nOn August 22, 2018, Taue announced at a press conference that he was battling stomach cancer. The diagnosis came from when he was originally hospitalized from a fall at his home on March 2 that caused bleeding from the stomach, which required an emergency blood transfusion. He also revealed that on April 16, he underwent a gastrectomy after discovering the cancer during an examination.\n\n\n\n\n *（ステーキ居酒屋チャンプ）\n"}
{"id": "2313403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313403", "title": "Hopanoids", "text": "Hopanoids\n\nHopanoids are a diverse subclass of triterpenoids with the same hydrocarbon skeleton as the compound hopane. This group of pentacyclic molecules therefore refers to simple hopenes, hopanols and hopanes, but also to extensively functionalized derivatives such as bacteriohopanepolyols (BHP) and hopanoids covalently attached to lipid A.\n\nThe first known hopanoid, hydroxyhopanone, was isolated by two chemists at The National Gallery, London working on the chemistry of dammar gum, a natural resin used as a varnish for paintings. The name hopane was derived from the genus Hopea (a source of the resin), which in turn was named after the botanist John Hope. Since this first finding in an angiosperm, however, hopanoids have been found in membranes of bacteria, lichens, bryophytes, ferns and fungi. Because of their geostable structures, various hopanoids are preserved in petroleum reservoirs, rocks and sediment, allowing them to be used as biological markers. Hopanoids have not been detected in archaea.\n\nAbout 10% of sequenced bacterial genomes have a putative \"shc\" gene encoding a squalene-hopene cyclase and can presumably make hopanoids, which have been shown to play diverse roles in the plasma membrane and may allow some organisms to adapt in extreme environments.\n\nSince hopanoids modify plasma membrane properties in bacteria, they are frequently compared to sterols, such as cholesterol, which modulate membrane fluidity and serve other functions in eukaryotes. Although hopanoids do not seem to rescue sterol deficiency, they do condense membranes and decrease permeability. Also, gammaproteobacteria and eukaryotic organisms such as lichens and bryophytes have been shown to produce both sterols and hopanoids, suggesting these lipids may have other distinct functions. Notably, the way hopanoids pack into the plasma membrane can change depending on what functional groups are attached. The hopanoid bacteriohopanetetrol assumes a transverse orientation in lipid bilayers, but diploptene localizes between the inner and outer leaflet, presumably thickening the membrane to decrease permeability.\n\nThe hopanoid diplopterol orders membranes by interacting with lipid A, a common membrane lipid in bacteria, in ways similar to how cholesterol and sphingolipids interact in eukaryotic plasma membranes. Diplopterol and cholesterol were demonstrated to promote condensation and inhibit gel-phase formation in both sphingomyelin monolayers and monolayers of glycan-modified lipid A. Furthermore, both diplopterol and cholesterol could rescue pH-dependent phase transitions in glycan-modified lipid A monolayers. The role of hopanoids in membrane-mediated acid tolerance is further supported by observations of acid-inhibited growth and morphological abnormalities of the plasma membrane in hopanoid-deficient bacteria with mutant squalene-hopene cyclases.\n\nHopanoids are produced in several nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In the actinomycete Frankia, hopanoids in diazovesicle membranes likely restrict the entry of oxygen by making the lipid bilayer more tight and compact. In \"Bradyrhizobium\", hopanoids chemically bonded to lipid A increase membrane stability and rigidity, enhancing stress tolerance and intracellular survival in Aeschynomene legumes. In the cyanobacterium \"Nostoc punctiforme\", large quantities of 2-methylhopanoids localize to the outer membranes of survival structures called akinetes. In another example of stress tolerance, hopanoids in the aerial hyphae (spore bearing structures) of the prokaryotic soil bacteria Streptomyces are thought to minimize water loss across the membrane to the air.\n\nSince hopanoids are a C₃₀ terpenoid, biosynthesis begins with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAP), which are combined to form longer chain isoprenoids. Synthesis of these smaller precursors proceeds either via the mevalonate pathway or the methylerythritol-4-phosphate pathway depending on the bacterial species, although the latter tends to be more common. DMAP condenses with one molecule of IPP to geranyl pyrophosphate, which in turn condenses with another IPP to generate farnesyl pyrophosphate. Squalene synthase, coded for by the gene \"sqs\", then catalyzes the condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphate molecules to squalene while oxidizing NADPH.\n\nNext, a squalene-hopene cyclase catalyzes an elaborate cyclization reaction, engaging squalene in an energetically favorable all-chair conformation before creating 5 cycles, 6 covalent bonds, and 9 chiral centers on the molecule in a single step. This enzyme, coded for by the gene \"shc,\" has a double ⍺-barrel fold characteristic of terpenoid biosynthesis and is present in the cell as a monotopic homodimer, meaning pairs of the cyclase are embedded in but do not span the plasma membrane. \"In vitro\", this enzyme exhibits promiscuous substrate specificity, also cyclizing 2,3-oxidosqualene.\n\nAromatic residues in the active site form several unfavorable carbocations on the substrate which are quenched by a rapid polycyclization. In the last substep of the cyclization reaction, after electrons comprising the terminal alkene bond on the squalene have attacked the hopenyl carbocation to close the E ring, the C-22 carbocation may be quenched by mechanisms that lead to different hopanoid products. Nucleophilic attack of water will yield diplopterol, while deprotonation at an adjacent carbon will form one of several hopene isomers, often diploptene.\n\nAfter cyclization, hopanoids are frequently modified by hopanoid biosynthesis enzymes encoded by genes in the same operon as \"shc\", \"hpn\". For instance, the radical SAM protein HpnH adds an adenosine group to diploptene, forming the extended C35 hopanoid adenosylhopane, which can then be further modified by other \"hpn\" gene products to form bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT). Additional modification occurs as the glycosyltransferase HpnI converts BHT to N-acetylglucosaminyl-BHT. In sequence, the hopanoid biosynthesis associated protein HpnK mediates deacetylation to glucosaminyl-BHT, from which radical SAM protein HpnJ generates a cyclitol ether.\n\nImportantly, C30 and C35 hopanoids alike may be methylated at C-2 and C-3 positions by the radical SAM methyltransferases HpnP and HpnR, respectively. These two methylations are particularly geostable compared to side-chain modifications and have entertained geobiologists for decades.\n\nIn a biosynthetic pathway exclusive to some bacteria, diploptene is a precursor for the pentacyclic triterpenoid tetrahymanol, which instead is produced directly from squalene by a cyclase in eukaryotes.\n\nHopanoids have been estimated to be the most abundant natural products on Earth, remaining in the organic fraction of all sediments, independent of age, origin or nature. Biomolecules like DNA and proteins are degraded during diagenesis, but polycyclic lipids persist in the environment over geologic timescales due to their fused, stable structures. Although hopanoids and sterols are reduced to hopanes and steranes during deposition, these diagenetic products can still be useful biomarkers, or molecular fossils, for studying the coevolution of early life and Earth.\n\n2-methylhopanes supposedly from photosynthetic cyanobacteria and steranes were reported by Roger Summons and colleagues as molecular fossils preserved in 2.7 Gya shales from the Pilbara region in Western Australia. The presence of abundant 2-alpha-methylhopanes preserved in these shales was interpreted as evidence of oxygenic photosynthesis at least 2.7 Gya, unexpectedly suggesting a 400 million year gap between the evolution of oxygenic metabolism and when atmosphere became oxidizing. This interpretation of the biomarker record was challenged when \"Geobacter sulfurreducens\" was demonstrated to synthesize diverse hopanols, although not 2-methyl-hopanols, when grown under strictly anaerobic conditions. The integrity of 2-methylhopanes as biomarkers for oxygenic photosynthesis was then further attenuated by evidence that the phototroph \"Rhodopseudomonas palustris\" produced 2-methyl-BHPs only under anoxic conditions. Concrete evidence came from studies showing that not all cyanobacteria make hopanoids and that genes coding for the methyltransferase HpnP are present in nonphotosynthetic alphaproteobacteria and acidobacteria.\n\nBiomarker findings in the Pilbara-Craton shales were later rejected altogether during more recent evaluations of the fossil triterpenoid record. Currently, the oldest detected triterpenoid fossils are Mesoproterozoic okenanes, steranes, and methylhopanes from a 1.64 Gya basin in Australia. However, molecular clock analyses estimate that the earliest sterols were likely produced around 2.3 Gya, around the same time as the Great Oxidation Event, with hopanoid synthesis arising even earlier.\n\nFor several reasons, hopanoids and squalene-hopene cyclases have been hypothesized to be more ancient than sterols and oxidosqualene cyclases. First, diplopterol is formed from water quenching the C-22 carbocation, meaning it can be made without molecular oxygen and could have served as a sterol surrogate before Earth's atmosphere became oxic. Furthermore, squalene binds to squalene-hopene cyclases in a low-energy, all-chair conformation while oxidosqualene is cyclized in a more strained, chair-boat-chair-boat conformation. Squalene-hopene cyclases also display more substrate promiscuity in that they cyclize oxidosqualene \"in vitro\", causing some scientists to hypothesize that they are evolutionary predecessors to oxidosqualene cyclases. Other scientists have proposed that squalene-hopene and oxidosqualene cyclases diverged from a common ancestor, a putative bacterial cyclase that would have made a tricyclic malabaricanoid or tetracyclic dammarinoid product.\n\nThe elegant mechanism behind the protonase activity of squalene-hopene cyclase was appreciated and adapted by chemical engineers at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Active site engineering resulted in loss of the enzyme's ability to form hopanoids, but enabled Brønsted acid catalysis for the stereoselective cyclization of the monoterpenoids geraniol, epoxygeraniol, and citronellal.\n\nThe application of hopanoids and hopanoid-producing nitrogen fixers has been proposed and patented as a biofertilizer technique that increases environmental resistance of plant-associated microbial symbionts.\n\nDuring later studies of interactions between diplopterol and lipid A in \"Methylobacterium extorquens\", multidrug transport was found to be a hopanoid-dependent process. Squalene-hopene cyclase mutants derived from a wild type capable of multidrug efflux, a drug-resistance mechanism mediated by integral transport proteins, lost the ability to perform both multidrug transport and hopanoid synthesis. Researchers indicate this could be due to direct regulation of transport proteins by hopanoids or indirectly by altering membrane ordering in a way that disrupts the transport system.\n"}
{"id": "2313411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313411", "title": "STS-3xx", "text": "STS-3xx\n\nSpace Shuttle missions designated STS-3xx (officially called Launch On Need (LON) missions) were rescue missions which would have been mounted to rescue the crew of a Space Shuttle if their vehicle was damaged and deemed unable to make a successful reentry. Such a mission would have been flown if Mission Control determined that the heat shielding tiles and reinforced carbon-carbon panels of a currently flying orbiter were damaged beyond the repair capabilities of the available on-orbit repair methods. These missions were also referred to as Launch on Demand (LOD) and Contingency Shuttle Crew Support. The program was initiated following loss of Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" in 2003. No mission of this type was launched during the Space Shuttle program.\n\nThe orbiter and four of the crew which were due to fly the next planned mission would be retasked to the rescue mission. The planning and training processes for a rescue flight would allow NASA to launch the mission within a period of 40 days of its being called up. During that time the damaged (or disabled) shuttle's crew would have to take refuge on the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is able to support both crews for around 80 days, with oxygen supply being the limiting factor. Within NASA, this plan for maintaining the shuttle crew at the ISS is known as Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) operations. Up to STS-121 all rescue missions were to be designated STS-300.\n\nIn the case of an abort to orbit, where the shuttle is unable to reach the ISS orbit and the thermal protection system inspections suggest the shuttle cannot return to Earth safely, the ISS may be capable of descent down to meet the shuttle. Such a procedure is known as a joint underspeed recovery.\n\nTo save weight, and to allow the combined crews of both shuttles to return to Earth safely, many shortcuts would have to be made, and the risks of launching another orbiter without resolving the failure which caused the previous orbiter to become disabled would have to be faced.\n\nA number of pieces of Launch on Need flight hardware were built in preparation for a rescue mission including:\n\nThe Remote Control Orbiter (RCO), also known as the Autonomous Orbiter Rapid Prototype (AORP), was a term used by NASA to describe a shuttle that could perform entry and landing without a human crew on board via remote control. NASA developed the RCO in-flight maintenance (IFM) cable to extend existing auto-land capabilities of the shuttle to allow remaining tasks to be completed from the ground. The purpose of the RCO IFM cable was to provide an electrical signal connection between the Ground Command Interface Logic (GCIL) and the flight deck panel switches. The cable is approximately long, weighs over , and has 16 connectors. With this system, signals could be sent from the Mission Control Center to the unmanned shuttle to control the following systems:\n\nThe RCO IFM cable first flew aboard STS-121 and was transferred to the ISS for storage during the mission. The cable remained aboard the ISS until the end of the Shuttle program. Prior to STS-121 the plan was for the damaged shuttle to be abandoned and allowed to burn up on reentry. The prime landing site for an RCO orbiter would be Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Edwards Air Force Base, a site already used to support shuttle landings, was the prime RCO landing site for the first missions carrying the equipment; however Vandenberg was later selected as the prime site as it is nearer the coast, and the shuttle can be ditched in the Pacific should a problem develop that would make landing dangerous. White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico is a likely alternate site. A major consideration in determining the landing site would be the desire to perform a high-risk re-entry far away from populated areas. The flight resource book, and flight rules in force during STS-121 suggest that the damaged shuttle would reenter on a trajectory such that if it should break up, it would do so with debris landing in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Soviet Buran shuttle was also remotely controlled during its entire maiden flight without a crew aboard. Landing was carried out by an on board, automatic system.\n\nAs of March 2011 the Boeing X-37 extended duration robotic spaceplane has demonstrated autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing. The X-37 was originally intended for launch from the Shuttle payload bay, but following the \"Columbia\" disaster, it was launched in a shrouded configuration on an Atlas V.\n\nThe STS-3xx missions were developed in the aftermath of the loss of \"Columbia\". However, NASA spent some effort researching rescue options even before the disaster. Before the ISS was launched, or in the event of a Shuttle being unable to reach the station, crews would have had to transfer directly between Shuttles. The orbiters would have been unable to dock, so while they used their RMS arms to grapple each other, the crew would have made an EVA between the Shuttles. This would have been carried out using the two EVA-designated mission specialists wearing the Shuttle/ISS Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuits, while the remaining crew would have been sealed up in pressurized Personal Rescue Enclosure and carried over either by hand, or using a pulley system (akin to that of a clothesline pulley) like that employed in the Apollo program for lifting samples from the Moon's surface into the Lunar Module.\n\nHad a LON mission been required, a timeline would have been developed similar to the following:\n\n\nSTS-400 was the Space Shuttle contingency support (Launch On Need) flight that would have been launched using if a major problem occurred on during STS-125, the final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission (HST SM-4).\n\nDue to the much lower orbital inclination of the HST compared to the ISS, the shuttle crew would have been unable to use the International Space Station as a \"safe haven,\" and NASA would not have been able to follow the usual plan of recovering the crew with another shuttle at a later date. Instead, NASA developed a plan to conduct a shuttle-to-shuttle rescue mission, similar to proposed rescue missions for pre-ISS flights. The rescue mission would have been launched only three days after call-up and as early as seven days after the launch of STS-125, since the crew of \"Atlantis\" would only have about three weeks of consumables after launch.\n\nThe mission was first rolled out in September 2008 to Launch Complex 39B two weeks after the STS-125 shuttle was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A, creating a rare scenario in which two shuttles were on launch pads at the same time. In October 2008, however, STS-125 was delayed and rolled back to the VAB.\n\nInitially, STS-125 was retargeted for no earlier than February 2009. This changed the STS-400 vehicle from \"Endeavour\" to \"Discovery\". The mission was redesignated STS-401 due to the swap from \"Endeavour\" to \"Discovery\". STS-125 was then delayed further, allowing \"Discovery\" mission STS-119 to fly beforehand. This resulted in the rescue mission reverting to \"Endeavour\", and the STS-400 designation being reinstated. In January, 2009, it was announced that NASA was evaluating conducting both launches from Complex 39A in order to avoid further delays to Ares I-X, which, at the time, was scheduled for launch from LC-39B in the September 2009 timeframe. It was planned that after the STS-125 mission in October 2008, Launch Complex 39B would undergo the conversion for use in Project Constellation for the Ares I-X rocket. Several of the members on the NASA mission management team said at the time (2009) that single-pad operations were possible, but the decision was made to use both pads.\n\nThe crew assigned to this mission was a subset of the STS-126 crew:\n\nThree different concept mission plans were evaluated: The first would be to use a shuttle-to-shuttle docking, where the rescue shuttle docks with the damaged shuttle, by flying upside down and backwards, relative to the damaged shuttle. It was unclear whether this would be practical, as the forward structure of either orbiter could collide with the payload bay of the other, resulting in damage to both orbiters. The second option that was evaluated, would be for the rescue orbiter to rendezvous with the damaged orbiter, and perform station-keeping while using its Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to transfer crew from the damaged orbiter. This mission plan would result in heavy fuel consumption. The third concept would be for the damaged orbiter to grapple the rescue orbiter using its RMS, eliminating the need for station-keeping. The rescue orbiter would then transfer crew using its RMS, as in the second option, and would be more fuel efficient than the station-keeping option.\n\nThe concept that was eventually decided upon was a modified version of the third concept. The rescue orbiter would use its RMS to grapple the end of the damaged orbiter's RMS.\n\nAfter its most recent mission (STS-123), \"Endeavour\" was taken to the Orbiter Processing Facility for routine maintenance. Following the maintenance, \"Endeavour\" was on stand-by for STS-326 which would have been flown in the case that STS-124 would not have been able to return to Earth safely. Stacking of the solid rocket boosters (SRB) began on 11 July 2008. One month later, the external tank arrived at KSC and was mated with the SRBs on 29 August 2008. \"Endeavour\" joined the stack on 12 September 2008 and was rolled out to Pad 39B one week later.\n\nSince STS-126 launched before STS-125, \"Atlantis\" was rolled back to the VAB on 20 October, and \"Endeavour\" rolled around to Launch Pad 39A on 23 October. When it was time to launch STS-125, \"Atlantis\" rolled out to pad 39A.\n\nThe Mission would not have included the extended heatshield inspection normally performed on flight day two. Instead, an inspection would have been performed after the crew was rescued. On flight day two, \"Endeavour\" would have performed the rendezvous and grapple with \"Atlantis\". On flight day three, the first EVA would have been performed. During the first EVA, Megan McArthur, Andrew Feustel and John Grunsfeld would have set up a tether between the airlocks. They would have also transferred a large size Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) and, after McArthur had repressurized, transferred McArthur's EMU back to \"Atlantis\". Afterwards they would have repressurized on \"Endeavour\", ending flight day two activities.\n\nThe final two EVA were planned for flight day three. During the first, Grunsfeld would have depressurized on \"Endeavour\" in order to assist Gregory Johnson and Michael Massimino in transferring an EMU to \"Atlantis\". He and Johnson would then repressurize on \"Endeavour\", and Massimino would have gone back to \"Atlantis\". He, along with Scott Altman and Michael Good would have taken the rest of the equipment and themselves to \"Endeavour\" during the final EVA. They would have been standing by in case the RMS system should malfunction. The damaged orbiter would have been commanded by the ground to deorbit and go through landing procedures over the Pacific, with the impact area being north of Hawaii. On flight day five, \"Endeavour\" would have had a full heat shield inspection, and land on flight day eight.\n\nThis mission could have marked the end of the Space Shuttle program, as it is considered unlikely that the program would have been able to continue with just two remaining orbiters, \"Discovery\" and \"Endeavour\".\n\nOn Thursday, 21 May 2009, NASA officially released \"Endeavour\" from the rescue mission, freeing the orbiter to begin processing for STS-127. This also allowed NASA to continue processing LC-39B for the upcoming Ares I-X launch, as during the stand-down period, NASA installed a new lightning protection system, similar to those found on the Atlas V and Delta IV pads, to protect the newer, taller Ares I rocket from lightning strikes.\n\nSTS-134 was the last scheduled flight of the Shuttle program. Because no more were planned after this, a special mission was developed as STS-335 to act as the LON mission for this flight. This would have paired \"Atlantis\" with ET-122, which had been refurbished following damage by Hurricane Katrina. Since there would be no next mission, STS-335 would also carry a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module filled with supplies to replenish the station.\n\nThe Senate authorized STS-135 as a regular flight on 5 August 2010, followed by the House on 29 September 2010, and later signed by President Obama on 11 October 2010. However funding for the mission remained dependent on a subsequent appropriations bill.\n\nNonetheless NASA converted STS-335, the final Launch On Need mission, into an operational mission (STS-135) on 20 January 2011. On 13 February 2011, program managers told their workforce that STS-135 would fly \"regardless\" of the funding situation via a continuing resolution. Finally the U.S. government budget approved in mid-April 2011 called for $5.5 billion for NASA's space operations division, including the Space Shuttle and space station programs. According to NASA, the budget running through 30 September 2011 ended all concerns about funding the STS-135 mission.\n\nWith the successful completion of STS-134, STS-335 was rendered unnecessary and launch preparations for STS-135 continued as \"Atlantis\" neared LC-39A during her rollout as STS-134 landed at the nearby Shuttle Landing Facility.\n\nFor the STS-135, no shuttle was available for a rescue mission. A different rescue plan was devised, involving the four crew members remaining aboard the International Space Station, and returning aboard Soyuz spacecraft one at a time over the next year. That contingency was not required.\n\n\"Launch On Need: The Quest to Save Columbia's Crew\" is a 2010 fiction novel by Daniel Guiteras, where Atlantis is pressed into service to rescue the crew of STS-107.\n"}

He was promoted lieutenant and captain in 1773, and in 1777 exchanged into the 60th Foot, in order to see service in the American War of Independence. With his regiment he served under Sir William Howe in 1778 and 1779—He was captured during a raid on the Bruges canal in 1798. He led the 2nd Brigade during the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, fighting at the battles of Bergen, Egmont and Castricum. In 1780 returned to England on being elected M.P. for Lymington through the influence of his uncle Sir Harry. He served under Lord Cornwallis in America in 1781 and 1782.\n\nAfter peace had been declared he returned to the guards in 1786 as lieutenant and captain in the grenadier guards, and was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1789. With the guards he served in Flanders from 1793 to 1795, and was promoted colonel in 1795, and major-general in 1798. In 1804 he became lieutenant-colonel commanding the 1st Foot Guards, and in 1805 he was promoted lieutenant-general.\n\nIn 1807 he received his first command in the expedition to Copenhagen under Lord Cathcart, when he commanded the 1st Division, and as senior general under Cathcart acted as second in command. He had very little to do in the expedition; yet on his return he was created a baronet, and also made governor of Calshot Castle.\n\nIn 1808 he was selected to supersede Sir Arthur Wellesley. He arrived on the coast of Portugal on 19 August, and wisely decided not to interfere with Sir Arthur Wellesley's arrangements. On 21 August Junot attacked Sir Arthur's position at Vimeiro, and was successfully beaten off, and the English general had just ordered Ferguson to pursue the beaten enemy, when Burrard assumed the chief command, and, believing the French had a reserve as yet untouched, forbade Ferguson to advance. The very next day Sir Hew Dalrymple assumed the chief command, and made the Convention of Cintra, with the full concurrence of Burrard, while Wellesley was ordered to do so due to his opposition to the convention. All three generals were recalled, and a court of inquiry was appointed to examine their conduct. Burrard succinctly declared the reasons for his course of action on 21 August. The result of the inquiry was to entirely absolve the generals.\n\nBurrard never applied for another command, but in 1810 as senior lieutenant-colonel he assumed the command of the Brigade of Guards in London. He died at Calshot Castle near Fawley, Hampshire, on 17 October 1813. He was buried in Lymington churchyard. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Charles (1793–1870), an officer who rose to the rank of admiral in the Royal Navy and on whose death in 1870 the baronetcy became extinct.\n\nOn 20 February 1789 he married Hannah, the daughter of Harry Darby, a London merchant; they had five sons and two daughters. All the sons served in the army or the navy. Two sons were killed in 1809 one of whom was acting as aide-de-camp to Sir John Moore at the battle of Corunna. He lost a third at the siege of San Sebastian which is said to have caused him to die of a broken heart. His wife survived him.\n\n\n\n"}

The track \"King\" was also selected by Bam Margera and appeared on his \"Viva La Bands\" compilation. The band teamed up with Bam's brother, Jess Margera, when they toured Europe with CKY in 2004. The track \"The Broken\" was included in the WWE video game \"WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006\" for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe band went through four different bass players, starting with Helen Storer, who played on \"Où Est la Rock?\" and was replaced by Fu Manchu bassist Brad Davis on \"FMEP\", who was himself replaced by former L7 bass player Janis Tanaka on \"The Second Great Awakening\". Former Systematic bassist Johny Chow then took the place of Tanaka for the \"Their Rock Is Not Our Rock\" album, which was recorded at Dave Grohl's 606 West studio and, like their previous works, was produced by genre legend Nick Raskulinecz. In another connection helped by Margera, they supported CKY on their 2005 Adio Footwear-sponsored tour, having already opened for them on their UK Tour in 2004. Original drummer John Oreshnick took a leave of absence due to family issues in the Fall of 2006 to be replaced by Yael during their recent tour. Yael and Johny Chow were former bandmates in My Ruin. Yael subsequently left the band in Winter 2006, and Oreshnick rejoined.\n\nRota considered becoming an ordained minister, but was persuaded not to on account of possible legal and taxation issues. However, he did eventually become ordained and performed wedding ceremonies for Matt Deis of CKY and Erica Beckmann in November 2005, and Bam Margera and Melissa Rothstein in February 2007.\n\nIn an interview for blabbermouth.net in May 2007, James Rota stated that \"we (Fireball Ministry) are in the stages of writing a new album\". In the same Interview, Rota also referred to what would later become The Company Band EP, \"Sign Here, Here and Here\". On 14 June 2008, Rota stated that three tracks had been recorded for the as yet unnamed fifth Fireball Ministry album, and was also working on a full length Company Band Album and a third, unspecified project to be announced by the end of 2008. However, Johny Chow was on tour playing bass guitar with Cavalera Conspiracy and Stone Sour.\n\nSome tracks from the album \"Fireball Ministry\" as \"Kick Back\" \"End Of Story\" and \"Fallen Believers\" appeared as a soundtrack on the Sons Of Anarchy television series\n\nThe band released their fifth album \"Remember the Story\" on October 6, 2017 via Cleopatra Records.\n\nThe band's imagery draws heavily from Christianity, with \"ministry\" in their name, the albums \"The Second Great Awakening\", and \"Their Rock Is Not Our Rock\", a reference to Deuteronomy 32:31. MTV.com described the band's music as having \"a musical chemistry between the members... that makes their songs buzz with warmth\".\n\nThe name \"Fireball Ministry\" comes from a Public-access TV show in Cincinnati that went by the same name.\n\n\nJames A.

An \"ace\" is generally considered to be any pilot who has downed five or more enemy aircraft, though the term has never been officially adopted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Accordingly, the numbers of victories attained by its fighter pilots were not routinely publicised by the RAAF during the war. Historians have gleaned figures from combat reports, unit histories, personnel records, and award citations, which sometimes recorded the pilot’s tally of victories at the time the decoration was recommended. The top-scoring Australian ace of World War II, Clive Caldwell, is generally credited with 28½ victories, that is 27 solo \"kills\" and three shared, or a total of 30 if shared victories are counted as one each. His total was almost twice that of the second-highest scoring Australian ace, Adrian Goldsmith with 17.\n\nFor aces of other countries, see List of World War II aces by country.\n\n"}

The defendant's hay rick had been built with a precautionary \"chimney\" to prevent the hay from spontaneously igniting, but it ignited anyway. He had been warned several times over a period of five weeks that the manner in which he built the hay rick was dangerous, but he said \"he would chance it.\" Consequently, the hay ignited and spread to the plaintiff's land, burning down two of the plaintiff's cottages.\n\nLinden, A., Klar, L., and Feldthusen, B. (2014). Canadian Tort Law Cases, Notes & Materials (14th ed). Canada: LexisNexis (p. 185).\n\nAt trial the judge instructed the jury to consider whether the fire had been caused by gross negligence on the part of the defendant, and stated the defendant \"was [duty] bound to proceed with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances.\" The jury found the defendant negligent.\n\nThe defendant appealed the trial court's verdict, arguing the jury should have instead been instructed to consider \"whether he acted bona fide to the best of his judgment; if he had, he ought not to be responsible for the misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence.\"\n\nThe court, composed of Tindal CJ, Park J and Vaughan J, rejected the defendant's argument, holding that the lower court's jury instructions were correct and therefore affirming the verdict. The court stated that to judge,\n\nThe court indicated that although this was a case of first impression, the \"man of ordinary prudence\" standard was supported by a similar duty of care applied in cases of bailment, in which liability was imposed only for negligence relative to that standard. The court also viewed the \"reasonable man\" standard as supported by the long-settled principle that persons must use their property so as not to harm that of others (\"sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas\"). Finally, the court held that the question of whether the defendant was liable because of negligence in violation of the reasonable person standard was a proper question for the jury (\"The care taken by a prudent man has always been the rule laid down; and as to the supposed difficulty of applying it, a jury has always been able to say, whether, taking that rule as their guide, there has been negligence...\").\n\nThe defense counsel had argued that there was no duty imposed on the defendant to be responsible for the exercise of any given degree of care, in contrast to the duty of care imposed on common carriers and bailees, or under an implied contract. This case was decided during a transitional period in the history of the common law rule on negligence and liability. Until the mid- to late 19th century in the United States and England, there was no settled standard for tort liability. Courts in the early 19th century often found a negligence requirement for liability to exist only for common carriers or bailees. English and U.S. courts later began to move toward a standard of negligence based on a universal duty of care in light of the \"reasonable person\" test.\n\n"}
{"id": "2313435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313435", "title": "João Franco", "text": "João Franco\n\nJoão Franco Ferreira Pinto Castelo-Branco, GCTE (; (14 February 1855 in Alcaide, Fundão – 4 April 1929 in Anadia) was a Portuguese politician, minister, 43rd Minister for Treasury Affairs (14 January 1890) and 47th Prime Minister (19 May 1906-4 February 1908).\n\nHe was the son of Frederico Carlos Ferreira Franco Freire (16 January 1829 – 1909), a nobleman of the Royal Household, and Luísa Henriqueta Pinto Correia da Costa Castelo-Branco (1835–1893).\n\nHe was educated at the University of Coimbra receiving a bachelor's degree in 1875. On entering an administrative career, he was able to prove himself in public competitions for several positions, including: delegate to the royal prosecutor in the comarcas of Sátão, Baião, Alcobaça and Lisbon (between January 1877 and January 1885); service chief of the general administration for customs-houses (from October 1885); administrator general for customs-houses (from February 1886 until December 1886); and court auditor for customs tax litigation (which began in 1886). From his post-University experience, it was obvious that Franco had a spirit and personal energy that would contribute to his partisan conflicts, and formed his role in Portuguese politics. Franco communicated and wrote well which, for the time, gave him advantages in public life, defined by debates and journalistic quarrels. He was rich, had good contacts, appreciated intrigue and immersed in commerce oriented toward service and merit, which united many of the liberal elite of the time.\n\nHe was elected for this first time in 1884, for the constituency of Guimarães, and only remained in this position until the Cortes contradicted the will of his electorate. Since the position of delegate and legislative deputy were incompatible, he opted to remain in the legislature, thereby losing his rights in the magistrates offices. Shortly after his election the conflict between Braga and Guimarães occurred, and he dedicated his efforts to support the residents of Guimarães, who had supported his election. The conflict lasted a year, and during that time he exhibited his judicial talents and charter as deputy for Guimarães, receiving sympathies from his electors. During the 1857 legislature, he was responsible for several speeches, covering political, administrative, economic and financial issues, that included issues such as the port of Lisbon, port of Leixões and customs. He regularly sparred with members of Progressive Party () between 1886 and 1890, and his name was associated with the first ministry (government) organized by the Regenerator Party.\n\nOn 14 January 1890, he was called before the councils of the Crown, and given the Finance portfolio, during the government presided by António de Serpa Pimentel, which had substituted the Progressive cabinet of José Luciano de Castro. At the end of eight months, on 12 October 1890, Pimental's government fell, resulting in his publication of a celebrated report on the state of the nation's finances, that resulted in vivid discussions. In 1891, following the fall of the Progressive ministry, a cabinet presided by general João Crisóstomo de Abreu e Sousa and the Regenerators, once again, took office. At that time Franco was given the responsibility for Public Works (which he occupied from 21 May 1891 to 14 January 1892). It was from this period that many institutional, industrial and agricultural reforms were implemented under his watch, including various measures were promulgated to develop industry and the economy. Among these laws, was the presentation of a bill to create new industries, which was never adopted (due to the government falling) but were promulgated in 1892 by decree. Inclined towards protectionism, Franco aligned himself with other protectionists in 1892, collaborating with them and Finance Minister Oliveira Martins, during his role as president of the Finance committee. It was during his oversight that Beira Baixa rail-line was inaugurated, visited by King Carlos and Queen Amélia in their first public event as monarchs, in the provinces of the north. Since July 1891, until 16 November, Franco also occupied the post of Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts ().\n\nBetween February 1893 and 1897 he managed the Kingdom's portfolio. At that time he reformed secondary school education, the administrative code (1896), electoral law, limiting the number of public service workers in the municipal councils, regulating pollution on the sea, laws against anarchists and the reduction of municipal districts and comaracas. These and other measures, as well as acts of force, such as the suppression of the \"Associações Comercial\" (\"Commercial Associations\") and \"Associações dos Lojistas de Lisboa\" (\"Lisbon Tenants Association\"), as well as the order to expel the republican warlord Salmeron, provoked heated discussions and captivated the attentions of the country. Franco did not waver, and through them doubled his efforts to end class anarchy, which he believed were against public order.\n\nIn July 1900, during the new Regenerator government Franco did not obtain a ministry; at that time the political and personal relationship between Hintze Ribeiro, the party chief, and Franco, chairman of the cabinet, were not cordial. The press writing around this time indicated that a full rupture was inevitable, owing to the differences of opinion. A fissure developed during the 13 February 1901 session: João Franco made a speech on overseas tax policies, which did not please the government, and indicated his open opposition. On 14 May, deputy Malheiro Reimão strongly attacked the income tax policy, which was, the next day, also attacked by João Franco, who boldly explained the reasons why he opposed the actions. These debates eventually resulted in the dissolution of the elected chamber, which was a controversial action on the part of the government. The government then revoked the electoral law, and substituted it (on 8 August 1901) with a comprehensive law, then immediately held general elections, resulting in João Franco and his political colleagues being disenfranchised. \n\nThis reinforced the split, resulting in the creation of a new party, the Liberal Regenerator Party, commonly called the \"Franquistas\", for its new political leader. Five years later, the administration of the country was actively party-oriented, and the Franquistas acquired several supporters. The tobacco concession and other questions, galvanized public opinion and the two mainlines parties, the Progressives and Regenerators, were incapable of maintaining their support, causing the abandon of several deputies to other parties.\n\nIn May 1906, tired of continued politicization, the King requested João Franco form a new government: it was composed of João Franco, as president of the council for the kingdom; Ernesto Driesel Schroeter, Finances; Luís Cipriano Coelho de Magalhães, Foreign Relations; Aires de Ornelas e Vasconcelos, Marines/Navy; António Carlos Coelho de Vasconcelos Porto, War; José de Abreu do Couto Amorim Novais, Justice; and José Malheiro Reimão, Public Works. By the time the proclamation was written the first Liberal Regenerator ministry had already adopted its first program, supported by the Progressive Party, in the self-styled \"concentração-liberal\" (\"liberal concentration\"). They immediately settled the tobacco issue in October 1906, with a new contract, and then implemented reforms, which they presented to the parliament: laws on public accounting, ministerial responsibility, the press and the repression of anarchists.\n\nDuring the 20 November 1906 session, his ministry expelled from parliament many of the Republican Party deputies, including Afonso Costa and Alexandre Braga for their excessive zeal. During the entire legislative session João Franco made several remarks highlighting his oratorical skills, against the members of the opposition parties. By decree, issued 16 July 1906, he received the 303rd Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword for his services to the Crown.\n\nFacing republican dissent, though, João Franco established an authoritarian government in 1907. \n\nHe was still in office when the king of Portugal, Carlos I, and his son and heir to the throne, Luis Filipe, were killed by republican revolutionaries on 1 February 1908. \n\nFranco was soon forced out (4 February) and a non-partisan Francisco Ferreira do Amaral, with all-party support was installed in the ministry; he never again held office.\n\nHe married Maria Lívia Ferrari Schindler (1858–1950), of Swiss German and Italian descent, 915th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa of Spain (3 November 1893), daughter of Gaspar Schindler and Maria Lívia Ferrari, both born and married in Lisbon, and had a son Frederico Gaspar Schindler Franco Castelo-Branco (18 March 1888 – 3 January 1931), married on 22 May 1919 to Maria Rita de Sá Pais do Amaral (14 September 1897 – 27 July 1926), daughter of the 5th Counts of Anadia, and had issue.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2313438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313438", "title": "Ba Swe", "text": "Ba Swe\n\nBa Swe (, ; 17 October 1915 – 6 December 1987) was the second Premier of Burma. He was a leading Burmese politician during the decade after the country gained its independence from Britain in 1948. He held the position of prime minister from 12 June 1956 to 28 February 1957. When Ba Swe became prime minister, \"Time\" magazine reported the news in an article titled: 'The Day of the Tiger' based on his nickname 'Big Tiger' (\"Kyah gyi\" Ba Swe) since his university days in the 1930s as a student leader.\n\nHis name was often paired with the name of another famous student leader as Ba Hein and Ba Swe, both \"Thakins\" or members of the nationalist \"Dobama Asiayone\" (We Burmans Association) and were arrested by the British colonial government during the year of countrywide protests, demonstrations and strikes in 1938 known as the \"1300 Revolution\" (\"Htaung thoun ya byei ayeidawbon\" named after the Burmese calendar year). Ba Hein became a founder member of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in 1939 and shortly afterwards Ba Swe and Ba Hein among others founded the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), renamed the Burma Socialist Party after the war. Ba Swe was also known for his penchant for wearing dark glasses.\n\nIn 1942, Ba Swe married Nu Nu Swe, daughter of U Hlaing Phyu, the owner of mining and lands in Palaw Township, Mergui District. They had ten children.\n\nBa Swe assumed the premiership in the aftermath of the parliamentary elections held in early 1956. Though the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL – \"hpa hsa pa la\") was returned the leftist coalition of parties known as the National United Front (NUF – \"pa ma nya ta\") won 37% of the vote. The number of NUF seats in Parliament was increased. However, on account of the 'first-past-the-post' electoral system, the NUF's representation in the Burmese Parliament was not reflected in the seats that it obtained. Still, the 1956 election results came as a shock to the AFPFL government. U Nu, the Prime Minister at the time, temporarily relinquished his office in order to devote full-time to reorganizing and strengthening the AFPFL. Ba Swe, as a deputy of U Nu in the AFPFL and leader of the Socialist Party, took over the job from U Nu. After less than nine months U Nu resumed office as Prime Minister on 28 February 1957.\n\nBy mid-1958 Ba Swe had fallen out with his senior colleague U Nu. The AFPFL split into two factions, and Ba Swe together with his colleague Kyaw Nyein and thirteen other ministers resigned from the government on 4 June 1958 and tabled a motion of no-confidence against U Nu in Parliament. On 8 June 1958 the no-confidence motion was put to a vote in Parliament but the government of U Nu survived the motion by a mere 8 votes because the leftist NUF voted with the government.\n\nAllegedly due to the instability arising from the split in the AFPFL and to the escalating insurgent problems U Nu on 26 September 1958 'voluntarily' invited the Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over as Prime Minister in a 'caretaker' capacity for an initial period of six months. On 28 October 1958 the Burmese Parliament, with the support of members from both factions of the AFPFL but in the face of opposition from the NUF, voted to appoint General Ne Win as Prime Minister in a 'caretaker government'. (In his memoirs, entitled \"Saturday's Son\", translated by U Law Yone and first published in 1974, U Nu claimed that his handover of power was not 'voluntary' but that a group of Army Officers led by Brigadier Aung Gyi and Brigadier Maung Maung threatened him with a 'straight military coup' should he refuse to hand over power to Ne Win.)\n\nIn the February 1960 elections, held during General Ne Win's caretaker government, the faction of AFPFL led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein, aka \"Swe Nyein\" faction (), contested as Stable AFPFL (, \"Ti myè hpa hsa pa la\"). The faction led by U Nu and Thakin Tin, aka \"Nu Tin\" faction, previously known as Clean AFPFL (; \"Thant shin hpa hsa pa la\"), formed a new party known as the 'Union Party' (, \"Pyidaungsu\" Party or ). U Nu's Union Party won the 1960 elections by a landslide.\n\nBa Swe was out of power and regarded as a 'dead tiger' politically at the time of General Ne Win's coup d'état in March 1962. Hence he was not among those detained by Ne Win's Union Revolutionary Council. However at the time of the 1963 peace parley between the RC and various armed insurgent groups, Ba Swe, like many other Burmese politicians of the left and the right during that period, was detained.\n\nBa Swe and U Nu, his former senior colleague and later adversary, were released on 27 October 1966. On the day of their release both Ba Swe and U Nu were driven to the office of the Revolutionary Council Chairman General Ne Win where Ne Win told them that if they wished to go on a pilgrimage either within the country or abroad, the government would bear their expenses. Ne Win also suggested that both might wish to go abroad for a 'medical check-up'.\n\nBa Swe, together with U Nu and Kyaw Nyein, was among the thirty three-men 'Internal Unity Advisory Board' that Ne Win's Revolutionary Council formed on 2 December 1968. The Board was to report to the RC by 31 May 1969 on ways of promoting national unity.\n\nBa Swe died in Rangoon in December 1987.\n"}
{"id": "2313440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313440", "title": "Lemon (automobile)", "text": "Lemon (automobile)\n\nIn US English, a lemon is a vehicle (often new) that turns out to have several manufacturing defects affecting its safety, value or utility. Any vehicle with such severe issues may be termed a lemon and, by extension, so may any product with flaws too great or severe to serve its purpose.\n\nThe Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act is a United States federal law enacted in 1975 to protect consumers from deceptive warranty practices. The Act was sponsored by Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington with co-sponsors Senator Frank Moss of Utah, and U.S. Representative John E. Moss of California. The purpose of the Act was to make product warranties more easily understood and enforceable, and to provide the Federal Trade Commission with a means of better protecting consumers. The Act does not force a manufacturer to include a warranty with its products but if there is one it must be in writing and comply with the rules of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.\n\nThe words used to describe a highly flawed item predates its use in describing cars and can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century as a British and American slang term. The British use is derived from the US use and is less precise or specific: to be \"sold a lemon\" is little different from \"sold a pup\".\n\nIts first attribution to mean a problematic car was in a Volkswagen advertisement created by Julian Koenig and Helmut Krone as part of an advertisement campaign managed by William Bernbach, all advertising executives with the firm Doyle Dane Bernbach in 1960, which was a follow-up to their Think Small advertising campaign for VW. \n\nEconomist George Akerlof in his 1970 paper \"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\" identified the severe lemon problems that may afflict markets characterized by asymmetrical information.\n\nNew vehicles may contain flaws or defects in workmanship, caused by design flaws or by an error during the automotive factory build process. These errors can range from parts being installed incorrectly to a tool that was used to build the car not being removed or a batch of materials with structural or chemical flaws. The idiom \"Friday afternoon car\" was used to describe new cars that had been delivered with numerous faults or suffered from an excessive number of warranty claims early in their lives – based on the premise that assembly line workers were far more likely to make errors at the times when they were perceived to be least interested in the standard of their workmanship.\n\nConsumer protection legislation typically labels vehicles as \"lemons\" if the same problem recurs despite multiple repair attempts (such as three times in a row over a short period, where previous attempts have not corrected the problem) or where defects have caused a new vehicle to be out of service for a prolonged period (typically 30 days or longer) for repairs.\n\nLemon laws primarily serve to force manufacturers to buy back defective vehicles or exchange them. Depending on the jurisdiction, a process similar to vehicle title branding may also be used to warn subsequent purchasers of the history of a problem vehicle. While this portion of a vehicle's history is usually not retained with the title when exporting it to another jurisdiction, at least one jurisdiction (California) has started compelling manufacturers to brand the titles of any previously reacquired vehicles that they import or export from the jurisdiction.\n\nWhile used cars may be plagued with the same problems that beset new vehicles, used vehicles may also have been abused, improperly maintained or poorly repaired, been unprofessionally rebuilt after a collision or tampered with in some manner to conceal high mileage, mechanical defects, corrosion or other damage.\nOne form of lemon is called a cut and shut or clipping, a form of body collision \"repair\" based on buying a wrecked car and sawing off the wrecked section to replace it with a matching section from another (similar) car. If improperly repaired, these vehicles may be inherently dangerous; at high speeds, or in an accident, the car may come apart due to the weaknesses of the welds or pins connecting the two segments of the vehicle or mismatches of segments. In the UK \"cut and shut\" cars are treated like any car that has had major repair work resulting in what is essentially a new car. They must first be inspected for road-worthiness, be assigned a new registration number and pass the standard MOT test. If this is successful, they will be given a \"Q\" registration, meaning they are a kit, or composite car, and not an original unit from the manufacturer.\n\nIn some states of the USA, the sale of \"cut and shut\" vehicles is illegal. Cars created using two or more large sections of previous ones are sometimes called \"zipper cars\".\n\nImproperly repaired collision-damage vehicles also carry the risk of unibody problems. Unlike heavy trucks and lorries, most passenger cars manufactured since 1987 employ unibody construction instead of a separate body and frame. This saves weight, but the unibody is prone to bend (it is designed to do so in an impact, to absorb part of the energy of the shock) or suffer damage in severe collisions, causing the vehicle not to handle correctly or causing other mechanical parts to wear prematurely if the damaged unibody vehicle is driven after an accident.\n\nToday, there are vehicle history services that can help a prospective used car buyer by providing a \"history report\" based on the vehicle's identification number (VIN). These reports will indicate items of public record, such as vehicle title branding, lemon law buybacks and recalls. They may indicate minor/moderate collision damage or improper vehicle maintenance. An attempt to identify vehicles that have been previously owned by hire car rental agencies, police and emergency services or taxi fleets is also made. However, consumers should research vehicles carefully, as these reporting services only report the information to which they have access.\n\nManufacturers have been known to \"hide\" lemon law buybacks from these reporting services through such unscrupulous methods as holding the buyback vehicle in a dealer's inventory for a short period of time, then funneling it through routine inventory (so-called \"dealer only\") auctions where the buyback vehicle re-enters the used market as a seemingly legitimate vehicle. While history reports can provide useful information and highlight trouble areas, consumers are still advised to have a trusted, independent mechanic perform a pre-buy inspection on any used vehicle of which they do not personally know the history.\n\n"}

In Brazil, Tectoy released the game as Sapo Xulé: Os Invasores do Brejo (translated as \"Xulé Frog: Invaders of the Swamp\"), in which Psycho Fox and his friends were replaced by Sapo Xulé (a Brazilian comic frog character), a pig, a turtle and a mouse.\n\nAmong a group of fox priests who worship the Inari Daimyojin (Fox Deity), one evil fox named Madfox Daimyōjin infiltrated his way to the highest ranks and took over the shrine. After seizing power, Madfox corrupted the land and created hordes of creatures. One young fox (who would earn the name Psycho Fox) has been chosen by his fellow people to rid the land of this evil deity.\n\nThe player takes control of Psycho Fox in this side-scrolling video game. Psycho Fox must get from the left-hand side of the level to the right-hand side of the level with many enemies in the way. He can use a Shinto stick to change into other characters/animals, namely a hippopotamus, a monkey or a tiger, each of which has its own special ability. The hippopotamus is slow and cannot jump very high, but can punch through special destructible blocks in the game world. The monkey can jump higher than the other creatures and the tiger can run faster. Psycho also has an ally named Birdfly, who can be used as armor or as a boomerang. If Psycho is hit while carrying Birdfly, Birdfly goes away and the player does not lose a life.\n\nThe game was positively reviewed by \"Mean Machines\" magazine mainly for its addictiveness and good quality graphics. \"S: The Sega Magazine\" described it in 1990 as \"one of the best games for the Master System\".\n\n\n"}

It is the second film version of Agatha Christie's 1939 detective novel of the same name.\n\nAlthough its background story is the same as the 1945 adaptation (\"And Then There Were None\"), with ten people invited to a remote location by a mysterious stranger, this one takes place on an isolated snowy mountain. This version is also the first adaptation of the novel to show the murders on screen. Actor Christopher Lee (uncredited) provided the pre-recorded gramophone voice of \"Mr. U.N. Owen\".\n\nTen people travel by aerial tramway to a snowbound mansion, invited there by a Mr. U.N. Owen (Unknown) to spend the weekend. They discover that none of them has actually ever met Owen, including his secretary as well as a married housekeeper and cook, all hired through an agency.\n\nFramed copies of the children's nursery rhyme \"Ten Little Indians\" are hung on the walls of each guest's bedroom. Dinner is served by the butler Grohmann on a tray adorned with ten little Indian figurines, as well. At exactly 9 p.m., as instructed, Grohmann switches on a hidden tape recording. A man identifying himself as Owen reveals that each of the 10 guests has a scandalous secret, their involvement in various innocent people's deaths.\n\nOne by one, the guests begin dying off. Mike Raven chokes after taking a drink and dies, and a little Indian from the centerpiece tray is broken away. In the morning, the cable tram is cut, killing the cook, Mrs. Grohmann who attempted to escape. General Mandrake conducts a search of the chalet's catacombs, splitting everyone into pairs, ultimately leading to his demise, stabbed after being led to a planted distraction (a cat). It becomes clear that their unseen killer is following the nursery rhyme. Ann Clyde, the secretary, enters into a romantic relationship with engineer Hugh Lombard as they and the others begin a deadly cat-and-mouse game, ultimately deducing that Owen is not their host but, in reality, one of them.\n\nAfter falling under suspicion from the others, Grohmann attempts to make his escape down the mountain peak, Devil's Leap, ending in his death after his lifeline is severed with an axe. Ilona bitterly confesses to having driven her husband to suicide, and is later found dead in her bedroom, killed with a syringe. By now, the five remaining guests fall under distrust of one another, and alliances are formed as the generator shuts down, casting the mansion into total darkness. At dinner, each person reveals the nature of their accusations, but before Ann can attest to her crime, she separates from the group to her room, where she screams upon discovering an Indian decoy hung from the ceiling. In the confusion, Judge Cannon is found with a gunshot wound to his head.\n\nDr. Armstrong intimates his suspicions of Ann, which Lombard angrily rebuffs. Lombard later comes to Ann's room and confides that his real name is Charles Morley, and that the real Lombard had committed suicide and he took his place for the weekend. Morley gives Ann his revolver for her protection. In the morning, Blore discovers that Armstrong has vanished and the three conduct a search for him. Blore separates and goes outside where he is crushed by a large statue of a bear. Ann and Lombard discover the body of Dr. Armstrong in the snow and conclude that the killer can only be either of them. Ann pulls the revolver on Lombard and shoots at him, before returning to the mansion. She goes upstairs and discovers Judge Cannon very much alive, who explains how he enticed Dr. Armstrong to help him fake his death and that he intends to poison himself leaving Ann the last remaining survivor, who must hang herself and fulfill the rhyme, or be punished by the law instead. \nAs Judge Cannon is explaining his plan, having taken a fatal dose of poison, Morley reappears alive. They had faked his death after the bullet missed. Ann and Morley had planned the fake shooting scene as they had figured out that neither one of them was the killer. As he dies, Judge Cannon realizes his plan has failed, and Ann and Morley kiss in relief. They see the cat sitting among the fruit tray with only two Indians attached.\n\nIt was one of the first films Fabian made after his contract with Fox ended.\n\nThe house used in the film was Kenure House in Rush, County Dublin, Ireland. Most outdoor scenes were shot in the Zillertal in Tirol, Austria.\n\n\"Ten Little Indians\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on 14 March 2006 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and also recently by Warner Archive as a MOD (manufacture-on-demand) DVD available via Amazon.\n\n"}

Since then, Japan holds many international cooperations within the United Nations as a basic principle of its foreign policy. When Japan joined the UN in 1956, it did so with great enthusiasm and broad public support, for the international organization was seen to embody the pacified country's hopes for a peaceful world order. Membership was welcomed by many Japanese who saw the UN as a guarantor of a policy of unarmed neutrality for their nation, in addition to the security arrangement they concluded with US in 1951. To others, support for the UN would be useful in masking or diluting Japan's almost total dependence on the United States for its security. The government saw the UN as an ideal arena for its risk minimizing, omnidirectional foreign policy.\n\nAfter the late 1950s, Japan participated actively in the social and economic activities of the UN's various specialized agencies and other international organizations concerned with social, cultural, and economic improvement. During the 1970s, as it attained the status of an economic powerhouse, Japan was called on to play an increasingly large role in the UN. As Japan's role and its contributions increased so did sentiment, expressed as early as 1973, that Japan should be given a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China.\n\nBy 1990, Japan's international cooperation efforts had reached a new level of involvement and activism. Japan contributed about 11 percent of the regular UN budget, second only to the United States, which contributed 25 percent. Japan was particularly active in UN peacekeeping activities and in 1989, for the first time, sent officials to observe and participate in UN peacekeeping efforts (in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Namibia). In 1992–93 Japan led UN supervision of the peace process and elections in Cambodia, providing approximately 2,000 people, which included members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\n\nAs of 2005, Japan is again a strong advocate of a UNSC reform, in a joint campaign with Germany, India, and Brazil. All four nations strive to gain a permanent seat in the chamber. While the United Kingdom and France, and the United States back Japan's candidacy, it faces strong opposition from its two closest neighbors, China and South Korea.\n\nIn addition to its UN activities and its participation in Asian regional groupings, such as the Colombo Plan and the Asian Development Bank, Japan is also involved, beginning in the 1950s, in worldwide economic groupings largely made up of, or dominated by, the industrialized countries of Western Europe and North America. In 1952, Japan became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and of the World Bank, where it played an increasingly important role. In 1955, it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In 1966, Japan was admitted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which brought it into what was essentially a club of leading industrialized countries. Japan has participated actively since 1975 in the annual summit meetings of the seven largest capitalist countries, the Group of Seven, or G8, since Russia joined after the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n\n - Japan.\n"}

{"id": "2313472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313472", "title": "The Sunday Times", "text": "The Sunday Times\n\nThe Sunday Times is the largest-selling British national newspaper in the ’quality press’ market category. It is published by Times Newspapers Ltd, a subsidiary of News UK, which is in turn owned by News Corp. Times Newspapers also publishes \"The Times\". The two papers were founded independently and have been under common ownership only since 1966. They were bought by News International in 1981.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" occupies a dominant position in the quality Sunday market; its circulation of just over 650,000 exceeds that of its main rivals, the \"Sunday Telegraph\" and the \"Observer\", combined. While some other national newspapers moved to a tabloid format in the early 2000s, \"The Sunday Times\" has retained the larger broadsheet format and has said that it will continue to do so. As of December 2019, it sells 75% more copies than its sister paper, \"The Times\", which is published Monday to Saturday. \n\n\"The Sunday Times\" has acquired a reputation for the strength of its investigative reporting – much of it by its Insight team – and also for its wide-ranging foreign coverage. It has a number of popular writers, columnists and commentators including Jeremy Clarkson and Bryan Appleyard. A. A. Gill was a prominent columnist for many years. It was Britain's first multi-section newspaper and remains substantially larger than its rivals. A typical edition contains the equivalent of 450 to 500 tabloid pages. Besides the main news section, it has standalone News Review, Business, Sport, Money and Appointments sections – all broadsheet. There are three magazines (\"The Sunday Times Magazine\", \"Culture\", and \"Style\") and two tabloid supplements (Travel and Home). It has a website and separate digital editions configured for both the iOS operating system for the Apple iPad and the Android operating system for such devices as the Google Nexus, all of which offer video clips, extra features and multimedia and other material not found in the printed version of the newspaper. \nThe paper publishes \"The Sunday Times\" Rich List, an annual survey of the wealthiest people in Britain and Ireland, equivalent to the Forbes 400 list in the United States, and a series of league tables with reviews of private British companies, in particular \"The Sunday Times\" Fast Track 100. The paper also produces an annual league table of the best-performing state and independent schools at both junior and senior level across the United Kingdom, entitled \"Parent Power\" (with additional information available online), and an annual league table of British universities and a similar one for Irish universities. It publishes \"The Sunday Times\" Bestseller List of books in Britain, and a list of the \"100 Best Companies to Work For\", focusing on UK companies. It also organises \"The Sunday Times\" Oxford Literary Festival, held annually, and \"The Sunday Times\" Festival of Education, which takes place every year at Wellington College. \n\nThe paper began publication on 18 February 1821 as \"The New Observer\", but from 21 April its title was changed to the \"Independent Observer\". Its founder, Henry White, chose the name in an apparent attempt to take advantage of the success of the \"Observer\", which had been founded in 1791, although there was no connection between the two papers. On 20 October 1822 it was reborn as \"The Sunday Times\", although it had no relationship with \"The Times\". In January 1823, White sold the paper to Daniel Whittle Harvey, a radical politician.\n\nUnder its new owner, \"The Sunday Times\" notched up several firsts: a wood engraving it published of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838 was the largest illustration to have appeared in a British newspaper; in 1841, it became one of the first papers to serialise a novel: William Harrison Ainsworth's \"Old St Paul's\".\n\nThe paper was bought in 1887 by Alice Anne Cornwell who had made a fortune in mining in Australia and floating the Midas Mine Company of the London Stock Exchange. She bought the paper to promote her new company, The British and Australasian Mining Investment Company, and as a gift to her lover Frederick Stannard (‘Phil’) Robinson. Robinson was installed as editor and she married him in 1894.\n\nShe then sold it in 1893 to Frederick Beer, who already owned \"Observer\". Beer appointed his wife, Rachel Sassoon Beer, as editor. She was already editor of \"Observer\" – the first woman to run a national newspaper – and continued to edit both titles until 1901.\n\nThere was a further change of ownership in 1903, and then in 1915 the paper was bought by William Berry and his brother, Gomer Berry, later ennobled as Lord Camrose and Viscount Kemsley respectively. Under their ownership, \"The Sunday Times\" continued its reputation for innovation: on 23 November 1930, it became the first Sunday newspaper to publish a 40-page issue and on 21 January 1940, news replaced advertising on the front page.\n\nIn 1943, the Kemsley Newspapers Group was established, with \"The Sunday Times\" becoming its flagship paper. At this time, Kemsley was the largest newspaper group in Britain.\n\nOn 12 November 1945, Ian Fleming, who later created James Bond, joined the paper as foreign manager (foreign editor) and special writer. The following month, circulation reached 500,000. On 28 September 1958 the paper launched a separate Review section, becoming the first newspaper to publish two sections regularly.\n\nIn 1959 the Kemsley group was bought by Lord Thomson, and in October 1960 circulation reached one million for the first time. In another first, on 4 February 1962 the editor, Denis Hamilton, launched \"The Sunday Times Magazine\". (At the insistence of newsagents, worried at the impact on sales of standalone magazines, it was initially called the \"colour section\" and did not take the name \"The Sunday Times Magazine\" until 9 August 1964.) The cover picture of the first issue was of Jean Shrimpton wearing a Mary Quant outfit and was taken by David Bailey. The magazine got off to a slow start, but the advertising soon began to pick up, and, over time, other newspapers launched magazines of their own.\n\nIn 1963, the Insight investigative team was established under Clive Irving. On 27 September 1964, the \"Business\" section was launched, making \"The Sunday Times\" Britain's first regular three-section newspaper. In September 1966, Thomson bought \"The Times\", to form Times Newspapers Ltd (TNL). It was the first time both \"The Sunday Times\" and \"The Times\" had been brought under the same ownership.\n\nHarold Evans, editor from 1967 until 1981, established \"The Sunday Times\" as a leading campaigning and investigative newspaper. On 19 May 1968, the paper published its first major campaigning report on the drug Thalidomide, which had been reported by the Australian doctor William McBride in \"The Lancet\" in 1961 as associated with birth defects, and quickly withdrawn. The newspaper published a four-page Insight investigation, entitled \"The Thalidomide File\", in the \"Weekly Review\" section. A compensation settlement for the UK victims was eventually reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK.\n\nTNL was plagued by a series of industrial disputes at its plant at Gray's Inn Road in London, with the print unions resisting attempts to replace the old-fashioned hot-metal and labour-intensive Linotype method with technology that would allow the papers to be composed electronically. Thomson offered to invest millions of pounds to buy out obstructive practices and overmanning, but the unions rejected every proposal. As a result, publication of \"The Sunday Times\" and other titles in the group was suspended in November 1978. It did not resume until November 1979.\n\nAlthough journalists at \"The Times\" had been on full pay during the suspension, they went on strike demanding more money after production was resumed. Kenneth Thomson, the head of the company, felt betrayed and decided to sell. Evans tried to organise a management buyout of \"The Sunday Times\", but Thomson decided instead to sell to Rupert Murdoch, who he thought had a better chance of dealing with the trade unions.\n\nMurdoch's News International acquired the group in February 1981. Murdoch, an Australian who in 1985 became a naturalised American citizen, already owned \"The Sun\" and the \"News of the World\", but the Conservative government decided not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, citing a clause in the Fair Trading Act that exempted uneconomic businesses from referral. The Thomson Corporation had threatened to close the papers down if they were not taken over by someone else within an allotted time, and it was feared that any legal delay to Murdoch's takeover might lead to the two titles' demise. In return, Murdoch provided legally binding guarantees to preserve the titles' editorial independence.\n\nEvans was appointed editor of \"The Times\" in February 1981 and was replaced at \"The Sunday Times\" by Frank Giles. In 1983, the newspaper bought the serialisation rights to publish the faked \"Hitler Diaries\", thinking them to be genuine after they were authenticated by the own newspaper's own independent director, Hugh Trevor-Roper, the historian and author of \"The Last Days of Hitler\".\nUnder Andrew Neil, editor from 1983 until 1994, \"The Sunday Times\" took a strongly Thatcherite slant that contrasted with the traditional paternalistic conservatism expounded by Peregrine Worsthorne at the rival \"Sunday Telegraph\". It also built on its reputation for investigations. Its scoops included the revelation in 1986 that Israel had manufactured more than 100 nuclear warheads and the publication in 1992 of extracts from Andrew Morton's book, \"Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words\". In the early 1990s, the paper courted controversy with a series of articles in which it rejected the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nIn January 1986, after the announcement of a strike by print workers, production of \"The Sunday Times\", along with other newspapers in the group, was shifted to a new plant in Wapping, and the strikers were dismissed. The plant, which allowed journalists to input copy directly, was activated with the help of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). The print unions posted pickets and organised demonstrations outside the new plant to try to dissuade journalists and others from working there, in what became known as the Wapping Dispute. The demonstrations sometimes turned violent. The protest ended in failure in February 1987.\n\nDuring Neil's editorship, a number of new sections were added: the annual \"The Sunday Times\" Rich List and the Funday Times, in 1989, (the latter stopped appearing in print and was relaunched as a standalone website in March 2006 but was later closed); Style & Travel, News Review and Arts in 1990, and Culture in 1992. In September 1994, Style and Travel became two separate sections.\n\nDuring Neil's time as editor, \"The Sunday Times\" backed a campaign to prove that HIV was not a cause of AIDS. In 1990, \"The Sunday Times\" serialized a book by an American conservative who rejected the scientific consensus on the causes of AIDS and argued that AIDS could not spread to heterosexuals. Articles and editorials in \"The Sunday Times\" cast doubt on the scientific consensus, described HIV as a \"politically correct virus\" about which there was a \"conspiracy of silence,\" disputed that AIDS was spreading in Africa, claimed that tests for HIV were invalid, described the HIV/AIDS treatment drug AZT as harmful, and characterized the WHO as an \"Empire-building AIDS [organisation].\" The pseudoscientific coverage of HIV/AIDS in \"the Sunday Times\" led the scientific journal \"Nature\" to monitor the newspaper's coverage and to publish letters rebutting \"Sunday Times\" articles which \"the Sunday Times\" refused to publish. In response to this, \"the Sunday Times\" published an article headlined \"AIDS - why we won’t be silenced\", which claimed that \"Nature\" engaged in censorship and \"sinister intent\". In his 1996 book, \"Full Disclosure\", Neil wrote that the HIV/AIDS denialism \"deserved publication to encourage debate.\" That same year, he wrote that \"the Sunday Times\" had been vindicated in its coverage, \"The Sunday Times was one of a handful of newspapers, perhaps the most prominent, which argued that heterosexual Aids was a myth. The figures are now in and this newspaper stands totally vindicated... The history of Aids is one of the great scandals of our time. I do not blame doctors and the Aids lobby for warning that everybody might be at risk in the early days, when ignorance was rife and reliable evidence scant.\" He criticized the \"AIDS establishment\" and said \"Aids had becme an industry, a job-creation scheme for the caring classes.\"\n\nJohn Witherow, who became editor at the end of 1994 (after several months as acting editor), continued the newspaper's expansion. A website was launched in 1996 and new print sections added: Home in 2001, and Driving in 2002, which in 2006 was renamed InGear. (It reverted to the name Driving from 7 October 2012, to coincide with the launch of a new standalone website, Sunday Times Driving.) Technology coverage was expanded in 2000 with the weekly colour magazine Doors, and in 2003 The Month, an editorial section presented as an interactive CD-Rom. Magazine partworks were regular additions, among them 1000 Makers of Music, published over six weeks in 1997.\n\nJohn Witherow oversaw a rise in circulation to 1.3 million and reconfirmed \"The Sunday Times's\" reputation for publishing hard-hitting news stories – such as Cash for Questions in 1994 and Cash for Honours in 2006 and revelations of corruption at Fifa in 2010. The newspaper's foreign coverage has been especially strong, and its reporters, Marie Colvin, Jon Swain, Hala Jaber, Mark Franchetti and Christina Lamb have dominated the Foreign Reporter of the Year category at the British Press Awards since 2000. Marie Colvin, who worked for the paper from 1985, was killed in February 2012 by Syrian forces while covering the siege of Homs during that country's civil war.\n\nIn common with other newspapers, \"The Sunday Times\" has been hit by a fall in circulation, which has declined from a peak of 1.3 million to just over 710,000. It has a number of digital-only subscribers, which numbered 99,017 by January 2019. \nDuring January 2013, Martin Ivens became acting editor of \"The Sunday Times\" in succession to John Witherow, who became the 'acting' editor of \"The Times\" at the same time. The independent directors rejected a permanent position for Ivens as editors to avoid any possible merger of \"The Sunday Times\" and daily \"Times\" titles.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" has its own website. It previously shared an online presence with \"The Times\", but in May 2010 they both launched their own sites to reflect their distinct brand identities. Since July 2010, the sites have charged for access.\n\nAn iPad edition was launched in December 2010, and an Android version in August 2011. Since July 2012, the digital version of the paper has been available on Apple's Newsstand platform, allowing automated downloading of the news section. With over 500MB of content every week, it is the biggest newspaper app in the world. \n\n\"The Sunday Times\" iPad app was named newspaper app of the year at the 2011 Newspaper Awards and has twice been ranked best newspaper or magazine app in the world by iMonitor. Various subscription packages exist, giving access to both the print and digital versions of the paper.\n\nOn 2 October 2012, \"The Sunday Times\" launched Sunday Times Driving, a separate classified advertising site for premium vehicles that also includes editorial content from the newspaper as well as specially commissioned articles. It can be accessed without cost.\n\nThis 164-page monthly magazine is sold separately from the newspaper and is Britain's best-selling travel magazine. The first issue of \"The Sunday Times Travel Magazine\" was in 2003, and it includes news, features and insider guides.\n\nSome of the more notable or controversial stories published in \"The Sunday Times\" include:\n\nIn July 2011, \"The Sunday Times\" was implicated in the wider News International phone hacking scandal which primarily involved the \"News of the World\", a Murdoch tabloid newspaper published in the UK from 1843 to 2011. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown accused \"The Sunday Times\" of employing \"known criminals\" to impersonate him and obtain his private financial records. Brown's bank reported that an investigator employed by \"The Sunday Times\" repeatedly impersonated Brown to gain access to his bank account records. \"The Sunday Times\" vigorously denied these accusations and said that the story was in the public interest and that it had followed the Press Complaints Commission code on using subterfuge.\n\nThe Irish edition of \"The Sunday Times\" was launched on a small scale on 1993 with just two staff, Alan Ruddock and John Burns (who is at present associate editor). It used the slogan \"The English just don't get it\". It is now the third biggest-selling newspaper in Ireland measured in terms of full-price cover sales (Source: ABC Jan–June 2012). Circulation had grown steadily to over 127,000 in the two decades before 2012 but has declined since and currently stands at 60,352 (Jan to Jun 2018).\n\nThe paper is heavily editionalised, with extensive Irish coverage of politics, general news, business, personal finance, sport, culture and lifestyle. The office employs 25 people. The paper also has a number of well-known freelance columnists including Brenda Power, Liam Fay, Matt Cooper, Damien Kiberd, Jill Kerby and Stephen Price. The paper ended collaboration with Kevin Myers after it published a controversial column. The Irish edition has had four editors since it was set up: Alan Ruddock, Rory Godson, Fiona McHugh and, since 2005, Frank Fitzgibbon.\n\nFor more than 20 years the paper has published a separate Scottish edition, which has been edited since January 2012 by Jason Allardyce. While most of the articles that run in the English edition appear in the Scottish edition, its staff also produces about a dozen Scottish news stories, including a front-page article, most weeks. The edition also contains a weekly \"Scottish Focus\" feature and Scottish commentary, and covers Scottish sport in addition to providing Scottish television schedules. The Scottish issue is the biggest-selling quality newspaper in the market, outselling both \"Scotland on Sunday\" and the \"Sunday Herald\". \n\n"}

While used in many parts of the world, the midibus is perhaps most common in the United Kingdom, where operators have found them more economical, and to have a sufficient number of seats compared to full size single-decker buses.\n\nMidibuses are often designed to be lightweight to save on diesel fuel (e.g. smaller wheels than on larger buses), making them not as durable as heavier 'full size' buses. Some midibuses, such as the Scania OmniTown, are heavier and therefore more durable.\nIn some places such as Hong Kong, some bus routes have to be served by midibuses due to the winding roads along such routes.\n\nThe term \"midibus\" is not in common use in the United States, such smaller and lighter-duty buses not being employed in public transit roles there except in some very specialized instances. For example, Muni in San Francisco operates both and versions of the Orion VII transit bus to serve routes that include some of the steeper and curvier hills.\n\nIn charter / tour roles, there is indeed a gap between the minibus (12-28 seats) and the touring coach (47-50 seats). Several shuttle bus companies such as Goshen Coaches and Crystal have manufactured rear-engined vehicles that have 30–35 seats, but no generic term has ever been applied to them. They are usually lumped together with their smaller \"minibus\" brethren and called \"minibus\", or \"shuttle bus\". The only other alternative was to import a \"short\" (two-axle) version of European touring coaches, known often as \"baby coaches\", around long and equipped with some 30–32 seats. \n\nIn the 2000s, some manufacturers introduced mid-sized bus models based on large truck frames.\n\n\n"}

The park is located to the south of Bloomington, about east of the city of Mitchell on Indiana Highway 60. It contains a settler's village, the Gus Grissom Memorial (with the accompanying Gemini 3 space capsule), a nature's center, and campgrounds.\n\nThe park is located on the Mitchell Karst Plain, which allowed the park's caves and sinkholes to form in the limestone. The caves include Bronson Cave, Twin Caves, Shawnee Cave (Donaldson Cave), Hamer Cave, and others. A boat tour of Twin Caves is run by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, which travels about into the cave.\n\nA portion of the park is virgin timber, protected in the Donaldson Woods Nature Preserve. The Mitchell Karst Plain Nature Preserve is notable for its large number of sinkholes, more than 1000 per square mile. Many of the park's features were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, including the Spring Mill Inn, Spring Mill Lake, and most of the trails.\n\nA pioneer village can also be found in a valley in the park, featuring a historic watermill and nineteen other structures. A stream runs through the village, which is fed by a spring in Hamer Cave and powers the watermill. Heritage interpreters demonstrate crafts and skills from the 1860s. The Hamer Cemetery is located south of the village. The area, total, was purchased for the state park from a cement company for a single dollar. Constant flowing water allowed watermills to be erected anywhere. Restoration of the village was spearheaded by Richard Lieber and E.Y. Guernsey (employed by Indiana's Department of Conservation) in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nAlso of interest is a memorial to native resident of Mitchell, Gus Grissom, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, who died in the Apollo 1 accident.

Often called \"Gentleman Jim\", Fanning was the first general manager of the Montreal Expos of the National League (appointed in August 1968), and served the Expos in a number of capacities for almost 25 years. As their field manager in 1981, he guided Montreal into the playoffs for the only time in the 36-year history of the franchise.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Fanning grew up in the now unincorporated community of Moneta, Iowa, and attended its school, graduating with nine classmates in 1945. He played baseball for the Moneta Bulldogs and they earned a state runner-up title his sophomore season to Corwith. He later attended Buena Vista College in Storm Lake. In his professional playing days, he was a catcher who played most of his career in the minor leagues. He spent the 1957 season and parts of three others with the Chicago Cubs between 1954 and 1957, compiling an anemic batting average of .170 in 64 career games played, with no home runs and 24 hits. On Sep 14, 1957, in the second game of a double-header against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Fanning caught Cub pitcher Dave Hillman, playing on their shared 30th birthdays, the only known instance of a battery sharing the same birth date (that game, though, is more famous for the three home runs hit by Chicago's star shortstop Ernie Banks). Fanning then became a manager in the minor leagues, eventually joining the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves organization, where in the middle of the 1960s he was promoted to the positions of Director of Minor League Operations and assistant general manager.\n\nFanning was briefly listed as a coach for the 1968 Braves, but before the season began he resigned to become the first director of the Central Scouting Bureau. Just months later, when his old Milwaukee boss, John McHale, became the first president of the expansion Expos, Fanning accompanied him to Canada as the Expos' general manager. Fanning and McHale built the Expos from scratch; in those days, prior to the era of free agency, newly formed clubs could only rely on expansion and amateur drafts and trades to build their talent base.\n\nFanning drafted wisely in the 1968 NL expansion lottery, and parlayed some of his drafted players to obtain via trade Rusty Staub from the Houston Astros. Dubbed \"le Grand Orange\", Staub was one of the early folk heroes of \"les Expos\", along with fellow outfielder Mack Jones and no-hit pitcher (and future Expos' executive) Bill Stoneman. Just prior to the 1972 season, Fanning traded Staub to the New York Mets for three regulars – shortstop Tim Foli, outfielder Ken Singleton and first baseman Mike Jorgensen – who helped Montreal contend for the NL East title in 1973. Overall, with opportunistic manager Gene Mauch at the helm, Fanning achieved a degree of success during his eight years as GM, but when Montreal regressed in 1976, Fanning was replaced by Charlie Fox.\n\nHe then served in a number of front office posts with Montreal, including director of scouting, when, during the 1981 stretch run, he was called back into uniform. Manager Dick Williams, who had led the Expos into contention in 1979 and 1980, had alienated his players and clashed with the front office over his use of bullpen closer Jeff Reardon. With 27 games left in the season, Williams was sacked on September 8, and Fanning was named his replacement. The move came as something of a surprise; he hadn't managed in almost 20 years.\n\nFanning's calm and easygoing style favorably contrasted with Williams' hard edge, and the Expos won 16 of their last 27 games to capture the second-half NL East title, thus qualifying for the playoffs per 1981's strike-shortened, split-season format. The Expos then defeated the defending world champion Philadelphia Phillies in the first round of the playoffs to advance to the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the deciding fifth game, on what became known in Montreal as \"Blue Monday\" (October 19, 1981), Los Angeles outfielder Rick Monday hit a tie-breaking home run in the ninth inning off Montreal ace pitcher Steve Rogers. The Dodgers won, 2–1, and advanced to the World Series, where they defeated the New York Yankees. None knew it then, but 1981 would represent Montreal's only trip to the baseball playoffs; in 2005, the club relocated to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals.\n\nFanning returned as pilot in 1982, but the Expos finished a disappointing third, six games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Fanning moved back into the front office, handing over the baseball manager's job to Bill Virdon, recently fired by the Houston Astros. But Virdon could not arrest the Expos' decline in 1983 and was fired with 30 games left in the 1984 campaign. Once more, Fanning came down to the field and took over the club, but with poor (14–16) results, as the team finished a disappointing fifth.\n\nFanning, with a career major league managing record of 116–103 (.530), hung up his uniform at the close of the 1984 season and returned to Montreal's front office. He was succeeded as pilot by Buck Rodgers. After a brief stint as a color commentator on Expos radio and TV broadcasts, Fanning left the Montreal organization, working next as a scout for the Colorado Rockies prior to becoming an assistant general manager and then ambassador to amateur baseball/Canada for the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nHe was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Marys, Ontario, in 2000, and received his Canadian citizenship in 2012.\n\nFanning died as the result of a heart attack on April 25, 2015, at his London, Ontario, residence at the age of 87.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313520", "title": "Cicuta", "text": "Cicuta\n\nCicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a genus of four species of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants which grow up to tall, having distinctive small green or white flowers arranged in an umbrella shape (umbel). Plants in this genus may also be referred to as cowbane or poison parsnip. \"Cicuta\" is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly North America and Europe, typically growing in wet meadows, along streambanks and other wet and marshy areas. These plants bear a close resemblance to other members in the family Apiaceae and may be confused with a number of other edible and poisonous plants. The common name hemlock may also be confused with poison hemlock (\"Conium maculatum\"), or with the Hemlock tree.\n\nWater hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. Three members of the genus contain a toxin named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion. Medical treatment of poisoning may include the use of activated charcoal to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with supportive care including anticonvulsant drugs such as a benzodiazepine. High doses of anticonvulsant medicine are often required to halt seizure activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.\n\n\"Cicuta\" spp. are perennial plants that are all similar in morphology, growing up to a maximum of in height. The stem of the plant is branching, erect, smooth and hollow (except for partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem), sometimes being purple-striped, or mottled (typically only \"C. maculata\" has the purple stripes or spots). Attached to the base of the stem is a tuberous root with thickened rootstocks. The rootstocks are multichambered and contain a yellowish oily liquid which turns reddish brown on exposure to air and emits a characteristic smell of raw parsnip. The alternate leaves are 2 or 3 pinnately compound and may reach to in length. The leaflets are lanceolate, serrate, to in length, and sharply toothed. The plant flowers in spring or early summer; the flowers are small with green or white petals clustered in an umbrella shape (umbel) characteristic to this family; the umbel measures to across. The plants produce a cylindrical fruit which is to in length. The plant is spread primarily by seeds which are produced in large numbers and are small in size.\n\nThe genus \"Cicuta\" is one of many genera in the family Apiaceae, which is in the order Apiales. Apiaceae is also known as Umbelliferae, and both of these family names are permitted to be used by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. In Europe, \"Cicuta\" was not distinguished from the similar genus \"Conium\" before the year 1500. The first mention of the genus in the United States was in the eighteenth century. Carl Linnaeus formally described three species in 1753. The type species is \"Cicuta virosa\". The genus is now recognized to comprise four species:\n\nOther species names such as \"Cicuta bolanderi\", \"Cicuta californica\", and \"Cicuta curtissii\" are older names now recognized to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable \"Cicuta maculata\". \"Cicuta maculata\" is now recognized to have four varieties: var. \"maculata\", var. \"angustifolia\", var. \"victorinii\", and var. \"bolanderi\". Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that \"C. bulbifera\" and \"C. virosa\" are monophyletic, while \"C. douglasii\" may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species. Other common names for the genus in general include poison parsnip, beaver poison, wild carrot, wild parsnip, and false parsley.\n\nMembers of the family Apiaceae bear close resemblance to each other, and have many characteristics in common. \"Cicuta\" spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (\"Angelica archangelica\"), wild celery (\"Apium graveolens\"), pignut (\"Conopodium majus\"), wild carrot (\"Daucus carota\"), wild parsnip (\"Pastinaca sativa\"), and water parsnip (\"Berula\" spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shoreline of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are two or three times compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not at the base of the main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.\n\nAdditionally, there can be confusion between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (\"Conium maculatum\") as the common name hemlock is applied to both \"Cicuta\" and \"Conium maculatum\". Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock is to examine the leaf veins. Water hemlock is unique in the family Apiaceae in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.\n\n\"Cicuta\" spp. are found growing across North America and Europe. Typically, they grow in wet habitats usually alongside ponds and streams, in marshes or swamps, or areas that are swampy at least part of the year. Plants can also be found growing in water. Of the four species, \"Cicuta maculata\" has the most widespread distribution occurring across the majority of North America. \"Cicuta bulbifera\" also has a relatively large distribution, found throughout Northern North America. \"Cicuta douglasii\" is found in the northwest corner of North America, while \"Cicuta virosa\" is only found in central Europe and in the far north of North America.\n\nAll members of \"Cicuta\" except \"C. bulbifera\" contain high levels of the poisonous principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally closely related to the toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and in all parts of the plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of \"Cicuta\" can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.\n\nThe in mice administered cicutoxin by intraperitoneal injection is 48.3 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9 mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2 mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; it is thought ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name \"cowbane\". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant out of the ground ingesting both the foliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nUpon consumption, both in humans and other species, the symptoms of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity may be the first sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic–clonic. Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium, tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, and coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.\n\nDeaths usually occur from respiratory failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred within a few hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48 hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.\n\nWater hemlock poisoning is usually diagnosed following a history of plant ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures. Laboratory tests to determine the presence of cicutoxin in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and mass spectrometry have been used to detect cicutoxin but these tests are not performed routinely in hospital laboratories. If a sample of the plant ingested has been retained, diagnosis can be confirmed by having the plant identified by a botanist.\n\nInitial treatment of poisoning may include gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal. Decontamination is typically only performed if a potentially toxic amount of plant matter has been ingested up to one hour previously and the patient has a normal intact airway or has been intubated. There is no specific antidote for water hemlock poisoning and treatment mainly consists of supportive care. Treatment may include control of seizures with the administration of a benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam, or if seizures are refractory to this treatment, a barbiturate such as phenobarbital is administered. The anticonvulsant phenytoin is not recommended as it has not been shown to be effective for seizure control following water hemlock poisoning. Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates may cause respiratory depression and respiratory support including intubation and mechanical ventilation is required in these patients. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is recommended in symptomatic patients.\n\nFurther treatment for complications of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, or low blood pressure may be required. Metabolic acidosis is treated by administering sodium bicarbonate. Low blood pressure is usually treated with intravenous fluid replacement, but the administration of dopamine or norepinephrine may be required to restore blood pressure. The management of rhabdomyolysis includes ensuring adequate hydration and urinary alkalinization; a complication of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney injury, which may require management with hemodialysis. However, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other extracorporeal techniques do not remove cicutoxin from the blood and are therefore not useful in enhancing elimination.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313526", "title": "Astrograph", "text": "Astrograph\n\nAn astrograph (astrographic camera) is a telescope designed for the sole purpose of astrophotography. Astrographs are mostly used in wide field astronomical surveys of the sky and for detection of objects such as asteroids, meteors, and comets.\n\nThe invention of photography in the 1800s lead to designs dedicated to astrophotography, and they were popular in the 20th century also. For a long time various chemicals were used that respond to light, often recorded on a glass plate or film emulsion. By the late 20th century electronic detectors became more common with the data being stored electronically. An astrograph was common in observatories of this period, operated alongside instruments like the transit telescope, great refractors, and chronometers, or instruments for observing the Sun.\n\nAstrographs were often used to make surveys of the night sky, and one of the famous projects was Carte du Ciel. One of the famous discoveries using an astrograph was planet Pluto. Rather than looking through the telescope, it was discovered by using a device that compared images taken by an astrograph.\n\nMost research telescopes in this class are refractors, although there are many (usually larger) reflecting designs such as the Ritchey-Chrétien and catadioptrics such as the Schmidt camera. The main parameters of an Astrograph are the diameter and f-ratio of the objective, which determine the field of view and image scale on the photographic plate or CCD detector. The objective of an astrograph is usually not very large, on the order of .\n\nThe shape of the focal plane is often designed to work in conjunction with a specific shaped photographic plate or CCD detector. The objective is designed to produce a particularly large (for example, ), flat, and distortion-less image at the focal plane. They may even be designed to focus certain wavelengths of light to match the type of film they are designed to use (early astrographs were corrected to work in blue wavelengths to match photographic emulsions of the time).\nWide-angle astrographs with short f-ratios are used for photographing a huge area of sky. Astrographs with higher f-ratios are used in more precise measurements. Many observatories of the world are equipped with the so-called normal astrographs with an aperture of around and a focal length of . The purpose of a \"normal astrograph\" is to create images where the scale of the image at the focal plane is a standard of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm.\n\nAstrographs used in astrometry record images that are then used to \"map\" the positions of objects over a large area of the sky. These maps are then published in catalogs to be used in further study or to serve as reference points for deep-space imaging.\n\nAstrographs used for stellar classification sometimes consist of two identical telescopes on the same mount (a double astrograph). Each sky field can be simultaneously photographed in two colors (usually blue and yellow). Each telescope may have individually designed non-achromatic objectives to focus the desired wavelength of light which is paired with the respective color-sensitive (black-and-white) photographic plate. In other cases a single telescope is used to make two exposures of the same part of the sky with different filters and color sensitive film used on each exposure. Two-color photography lets astronomers measure the color, as well as the brightness (magnitude), of each star imaged. Colors tell the star's \"temperature”. Knowing the color type and magnitudes lets astronomers determine the distance of a star. Sky fields that are photographed twice, decades apart in time, will reveal a nearby star's proper motion when measured against the background of distant stars or galaxies.\n\nBy taking two exposures of the same section of the sky days or weeks apart, it is possible to find objects such as asteroids, meteors, comets, variable stars, novae, and even unknown planets. By comparing the pair of images, using a device such as a blink comparator, astronomers are able to find objects that moved or changed brightness between the two exposures or simply appear in one image only, as in the case of a nova or meteor. Sometimes objects can even be found in one exposure since a fast moving object will appear as a \"line\" in a long exposure.\n\nOne well-known case of an astrograph used in a discovery is Clyde Tombaugh’s discovery of the dwarf planet Pluto in 1930. Tombaugh was given the job of hunting for a suspected \"9th planet\" to be achieved by systematically photographing the area of the sky around the ecliptic. Tombaugh used Lowell Observatory's (3 lens element), f/5.3 refractor astrograph, which recorded images on glass plates.\n\nIn the amateur astronomy field many types of commercial and amateur built telescopes are designed for astrophotography and labeled \"astrographs\". Optical designs of amateur astrographs vary widely but include apochromatic refractors, variations of Cassegrain reflectors, and Newtonian reflectors. Most optical designs do not produce large, flat, and well-corrected imaging fields and therefore require some type of optical correction by way of field flatteners or coma correctors. Amateur astrographs typically have purpose-built focusers, are constructed of thermally stable materials like carbon fiber, and are put on heavy duty mounts to facilitate accurate tracking of deep sky objects for long periods of time.\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1992 to manage the public media, previously tightly controlled by the state, and regulate private broadcasting, which was then emerging.\n\nThe direct constitutional empowerment, election of members for very long terms by various branches of the government, and requirement that the KRRiT members can't belong to a political party, give it very strong position, compared to similar agencies in other countries. It was considered crucial that the media be freed from political pressures.\n\nWhile theoretically apolitical, members of the council were de facto appointed by the political parties, in rough proportion to their power. For a few years, because of the fragmentation of the Parliament, and ongoing conflict between the parliament and the president Lech Wałęsa, the council was in relative political balance, and so the public media weren't controlled by any particular party, while the private media were more concerned by economical expansion than politics.\n\nHowever, after the victory of the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in the 1993 parliamentary elections,\nand of their candidate Aleksander Kwaśniewski in the 1995 presidential elections, the council soon became dominated by people connected to the left. \nEven the right-wing 1997-2001 Parliament couldn't reverse that, because of the long terms of KRRiT members and the presence of the members appointed by the President.\nHaving won the next elections in 2001, the post-communists were able to retain control of the public media for the second part of the 1990s and the early 2000s.\n\nThe post-communist head of the public Polish Television, Robert Kwiatkowski, was widely accused of using it as a propaganda machine for the Democratic Left Alliance. Some of the early accusations include highly disproportional coverage of SLD in 1997-2001, when SLD leader Leszek Miller was given more airtime than all members of the government combined (according to some calculations), airing a documentary claiming Lech Kaczyński's involvement in the FOZZ scandal just before the elections (later found to be baseless), and a general bias in coverage of political news. KRRiT was also in constant conflict with private broadcasters, for example forbidding RMF FM to air local news.\n\nThe big problems however started only after the 2001 elections, when some members of the KRRiT were named in a conspiracy to gain control over the private media (the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and the TV station Polsat) by falsifying the laws (in the strand of the Lew Rywin scandal referred to as \"or newspapers\" (\"lub czasopisma\", in honor of wording of the media law that was illegally switched after approval by the government), and using their broadcast licensing power to exert political and economical pressure over local private broadcasters. These events, and other corruption scandals revealed soon afterward, shattered the Polish political class. These events were all tied into a complex scandal referred to as the Rywin Affair.\n\nIn 2004 Robert Kwiatkowski was replaced by a compromise candidate, Jan Dworak, as the head of Polish Television.\n\nMany parties taking part in 2005 elections proposed abandonment of the KRRiT.\n\nThe official website of the National Broadcasting Council is www.krrit.gov.pl\n\n\n"}

It has a seating capacity of 35,000.\n\nSituated in the Gerland quarter, it was used by French professional football club Olympique Lyonnais, who moved to the newly constructed Parc Olympique Lyonnais in 2016. Local rugby union club Lyon OU moved in beginning of 2017, replacing their much smaller stadium Matmut Stadium. The stadium's capacity was also reduced from 43,000 to a more reasonable 35,000.\n\nThe Stade de Gerland is listed as a Category three stadium by UEFA's standards and has hosted matches for the 1972 Rugby League World Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Genesis.\n\nIn 1910, the mayor of Lyon, Édouard Herriot, came up with the idea to develop and build a sports stadium with an athletics track and a velodrome in the city. In 1912, the stadium was officially mandated and local architect Tony Garnier was given the reins to designing and constructing it. Construction began in 1914 with hopes that the stadium would be completed before the International Exhibition of 1914. However, due to World War I, construction was temporarily halted, but resumed following the wars conclusion in 1919 with the assistance of a large number of German POWs. By 1920, the stadium was completely functional. In 1926, the Stade de Gerland was inaugurated by Herriot.\n\nThe stadium originally had a cycling track, but it was removed in order to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations were made to the stadium by architect Rene Gagis in order to bring the stadium up to standards for UEFA Euro 1984. This included construction of the Jean Bouin and Jean Jaurès stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as by that time FIFA had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the World Cup, had to be all-seated. The north and south stands were completely dismantled and rebuilt, the Jean Jaurès and Jean Bouin side stands were untouched and the athletics track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland had a maximum capacity of 40,500.\n\nFrom 1950 to 2015 the stadium was home to French professional football club Olympique Lyonnais. Lyon moved into the stadium as a result of splitting from the Lyon Olympique Universitaire sport club, which played at the Stade des Iris. Its record attendance for a Ligue 1 match is 48,552 set during a match between Olympique Lyonnais and Saint-Étienne in 1982.\n\nStade de Gerland can also used for events with mass audiences, such as concerts; in the past, it has hosted artists such as the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Pink Floyd, and Genesis.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the UEFA Euro 1984, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium hosted three pool matches in the 2007 Rugby World Cup: Australia vs Japan, Argentina vs Georgia and New Zealand vs Portugal.\n\nStade de Gerland played host to the 1972 Rugby League World Cup Final between Great Britain and Australia. The French public seemed uninterested in a final that did not involve the French team, as only 4,231 spectators turned up. The game will always be remembered by the British for their captain Clive Sullivan's wonderful long distance try, and by the Australians for perhaps \"The greatest try never scored\", later shown on TV to be legitimately scored by Australian fullback Graeme Langlands, but disallowed by French referee Georges Jameau who believed him to be offside (TV footage indicated Langlands had been approximately one metre behind halfback Dennis Ward as he put up his kick). Lions hooker Mike Stephenson scored the 73rd-minute try that helped Great Britain level the scores and secure the World Cup. Had Aussie winger Ray Branighan succeeded with a 79th-minute penalty, or Bob Fulton landed one of three drop goal attempts in the last five minutes, the cup could easily have gone to Australia. But for the first time in the competition's history the scores were level at full time. An additional twenty minutes extra time was played, but no further score resulted, and Great Britain were awarded the cup by virtue of a better W-L record and due to having defeated Australia earlier in the tournament.\n\n\n"}

A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. It is relatively certain that 2,500 German fighter pilots attained ace status, having achieved at least 5 aerial victories. This article lists 890 (updated as of October 2017) of these aces.\n\nGerman day and night fighter pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories during World War II, over 25,000 British or American and over 45,000 Russian-flown aircraft. 103 German fighter pilots shot down 100 or more enemy aircraft, for a total of approximately 15,400 victories. Approximately 360 German fighter pilots shot down from 40 to 99 enemy aircraft for a total of approximately 21,000 victories. Approximately 500 German fighter pilots shot down from 20 to 39 enemy aircraft for a total of approximately 15,000 victories. These achievements were honored with 453 German day fighter pilots and \"Zerstörer\" (destroyer) fighter pilots and 85 German night fighter pilots (including 14 crew members), for a total of 538 German fighter pilots, receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\n\nGerman losses, on the other hand, were very high as well. Roughly 12,000 German day fighter pilots were killed or are still missing in action, with a further 6,000 being wounded. The \"Zerstörer\" (destroyer) pilots suffered about 2,800 casualties, either killed or missing in action, plus another 900 wounded in action. German night fighter losses were also high, in the magnitude of 3,800 pilots or crew members killed or missing and 1,400 wounded. Hans-Ulrich Rudel was the most decorated flying ace in the Luftwaffe, primarily as a ground-attack bomber pilot with over 800 vehicles destroyed in addition to his victories over opposing aircraft.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Germany's highest-scoring pilots shot down many more aircraft than the most successful Allied pilots. During the first years of the war, German day fighter pilots tended to enjoy favourable tactical circumstances; for instance, during the Battle of Britain British pilots generally tried to attack the German bombers rather than the fighters protecting them. German combat tactics during this period also tended to be superior to those of the Allies, with formation leaders in particular often having a higher chance of success.\n\nFormal and informal Luftwaffe practices also contributed to the high numbers of victories achieved by some pilots. The normal practice in fighter units was for the highest-scoring pilot to lead formations, regardless of their rank, which placed them in the best position to shoot down Allied aircraft. The German pilots also typically conducted much more combat flying than their Allied equivalents: while the western Allied air forces frequently rested their fighter pilots or rotated them out of combat zones after a certain number of missions or flying hours, German pilots were required to fly until they became casualties.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the German archives made available to the public, including microfilm rolls of wartime records not seen since January 1945.\nThey show that although the Luftwaffe generally did not accept a \"kill\" without a witness (in which instance it was considered only a probable and didn't count in the victory scoring process), some pilots habitually submitted unwitnessed claims and these sometimes made it through the verification process, particularly if they were made by pilots with established records.\nUnlike all of the other air forces that fought during World War II, the Luftwaffe did not accept shared claims, but sometimes it happened. Each claim should have referred to a particular aircraft, but some victories were awarded to other pilots who had claimed the destruction of the same aircraft.\nFrom mid-year 1943 through 1944, the OKW communiques often overstated Allied bomber losses by a factor of up to two; these claims existed only in the communiques and weren't used in victory scoring. Defenders of the German fighter pilots maintain that overclaims were eliminated during the confirmation process, but the microfilms show that this wasn't always the case.\nStringent reviews and comparisons of Allied archives and German archives show that 90 percent of the claims submitted were confirmed, or found to be \"in order\" for confirmation, up to the time the system broke down altogether in 1945.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313597", "title": "In situ hybridization", "text": "In situ hybridization\n\n\"In situ\" hybridization (ISH) is a type of hybridization that uses a labeled complementary DNA, RNA or modified nucleic acids strand (i.e., probe) to localize a specific DNA or RNA sequence in a portion or section of tissue (\"in situ\") or if the tissue is small enough (e.g., plant seeds, \"Drosophila\" embryos), in the entire tissue (whole mount ISH), in cells, and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This is distinct from immunohistochemistry, which usually localizes proteins in tissue sections.\n\nIn situ hybridization is used to reveal the location of specific nucleic acid sequences on chromosomes or in tissues, a crucial step for understanding the organization, regulation, and function of genes. The key techniques currently in use include \"in situ\" hybridization to mRNA with oligonucleotide and RNA probes (both radio-labeled and hapten-labeled), analysis with light and electron microscopes, whole mount \"in situ\" hybridization, double detection of RNAs and RNA plus protein, and fluorescent \"in situ\" hybridization to detect chromosomal sequences. DNA ISH can be used to determine the structure of chromosomes. Fluorescent DNA ISH (FISH) can, for example, be used in medical diagnostics to assess chromosomal integrity. RNA ISH (RNA \"in situ\" hybridization) is used to measure and localize RNAs (mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs) within tissue sections, cells, whole mounts, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). \"In situ\" hybridization was invented by Mary-Lou Pardue and Joseph G. Gall.\n\nIn situ hybridization is a powerful technique for identifying specific mRNA species within individual cells in tissue sections, providing insights into physiological processes and disease pathogenesis. However, in situ hybridization requires that many steps be taken with precise optimization for each tissue examined and for each probe used. In order to preserve the target mRNA within tissues, it is often required that crosslinking fixatives (such as formaldehyde) be used.\n\nIn addition, in-situ hybridization on tissue sections require that tissue slices be very thin, usually 3 µm to 7 µm in thickness. Common methods of preparing tissue sections for in-situ hybridization processing include cutting specimens with a cryostat or a Compresstome tissue slicer. A cryostat takes fresh or fixed tissue and immerses it into liquid nitrogen for flash freezing. Then tissue is embedded in freeze media called OCT and thin sections are cut. Obstacles include getting freeze artifacts on tissue that may interfere with proper mRNA staining. The Compresstome cuts tissue into thin slices without a freeze process; free-floating sections are cut after being embedded in agarose for stability. This method avoids freezing tissue and thus associated freeze artifacts. The process is permanent and irreversible once its complete.\n\nFor hybridization histochemistry, sample cells and tissues are usually treated to fix the target transcripts in place and to increase access of the probe. As noted above, the probe is either a labeled complementary DNA or, now most commonly, a complementary RNA (riboprobe). The probe hybridizes to the target sequence at elevated temperature, and then the excess probe is washed away (after prior hydrolysis using RNase in the case of unhybridized, excess RNA probe). Solution parameters such as temperature, salt, and/or detergent concentration can be manipulated to remove any non-identical interactions (i.e., only exact sequence matches will remain bound). Then, the probe that was labeled with either radio-, fluorescent- or antigen-labeled bases (e.g., digoxigenin) is localized and quantified in the tissue using either autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, or immunohistochemistry, respectively. ISH can also use two or more probes, labeled with radioactivity or the other non-radioactive labels, to simultaneously detect two or more transcripts.\n\nAn alternative technology, branched DNA assay, can be used for RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA ) \"in situ\" hybridization assays with single molecule sensitivity without the use of radioactivity. This approach (e.g., ViewRNA assays) can be used to visualize up to four targets in one assay, and it uses patented probe design and bDNA signal amplification to generate sensitive and specific signals. Samples (cells, tissues, and CTCs) are fixed, then treated to allow RNA target accessibility (RNA un-masking). Target-specific probes hybridize to each target RNA. Subsequent signal amplification is predicated on specific hybridization of adjacent probes (individual oligonucleotides [oligos] that bind side by side on RNA targets). A typical target-specific probe will contain 40 oligonucleotides, resulting in 20 oligo pairs that bind side-by-side on the target for detection of mRNA and lncRNA, and 2 oligos or a single pair for miRNA detection. Signal amplification is achieved via a series of sequential hybridization steps. A pre-amplifier molecule hybridizes to each oligo pair on the target-specific RNA, then multiple amplifier molecules hybridize to each pre-amplifier. Next, multiple label probe oligonucleotides (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or directly to fluorophores) hybridize to each amplifier molecule. A fully assembled signal amplification structure “Tree” has 400 binding sites for the label probes. When all target-specific probes bind to the target mRNA transcript, an 8,000 fold signal amplification occurs for that one transcript. Separate but compatible signal amplification systems enable the multiplex assays. The signal can be visualized using a fluorescence or brightfield microscope.\n\n\nThe protocol takes around 2–3 days and takes some time to set up. Some companies sell robots to automate the process (e.g., Intavis InsituPro VSi). As a result, large-scale screenings have been conducted in laboratories on thousands of genes. The results can usually be accessed via websites (see external links).\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed Chancellor in 1383, and created Earl of Suffolk in 1385, the first of his family to hold any such title (the earldom had become extinct in 1382 on the death of William de Ufford). However, in the late 1380s his fortunes radically altered, in step with those of the king. During the Wonderful Parliament of 1386 he was impeached on charges of embezzlement and negligence, a victim of increasing tensions between Parliament and Richard. He was the first official in English history to be removed from office by the process of impeachment. Even after this disgrace, he remained in royal favour, although soon fell foul of the Lords Appellant. He was one of a number of Richard's associates accused of treason by the Appellants in November 1387. \n\nAfter the Appellants' victory at Radcot Bridge (December 1387) and before the Merciless Parliament met in February 1388, De La Pole shrewdly fled to Paris, thus escaping the fate of Sir Nicholas Brembre and Chief Justice Robert Tresilian. He remained in France for the remainder of his life. Sentenced in his absence, his title and estates were stripped from him.\n\nHe married Katherine Wingfield (1340–1386) daughter and heiress of Sir John de Wingfield (d. circa 1361) of Wingfield Castle in Suffolk, chief administrator to Edward the Black Prince (father of King Richard II), by whom he had eight children:\n\n\n"}

He was a grandson of King Huai of Chu. In 223 BC, during the Warring States period, the Chu state was conquered by the Qin state, which unified the various Chinese feudal states in a series of wars and established the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. In 209 BC, when rebellions broke out throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty, the Chu state was revived as an insurgent state against Qin imperial rule. Xiong Xin was discovered by Xiang Liang, a rebel leader who descended from a famous Chu general, , and installed on the Chu throne as \"King Huai II of Chu\". However, Xiong Xin was merely a puppet ruler because power was concentrated in Xiang Liang's hands, and was later passed on to Xiang Liang's nephew, Xiang Yu, after Xiang Liang was killed in battle. In 206 BC, the Qin dynasty was overthrown by the rebels, after which Xiang Yu, who was the \"de facto\" leader of all the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. He promoted King Huai II to a more \"honourable\" title – Emperor Yi of Chu – and made him the nominal sovereign ruler over all the Eighteen Kingdoms. Xiang Yu then had Emperor Yi relocated to Chen County (郴縣; in present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) and secretly ordered Ying Bu to assassinate the emperor during the journey.\n\nXiong Xin was a descendant of the royal family of the Chu state in the Warring States period, and a grandson of King Huai of Chu. However, he was not in the main line of succession and there were four kings who succeeded his grandfather before the Chu state was conquered by the Qin state in 223 BC. Xiong Xin lived as a commoner under Qin rule after the fall of Chu.\n\nIn 209 BC, the Dazexiang Uprising broke out under the leadership of Chen Sheng, who proclaimed himself \"King of Zhangchu\" (張楚王; lit. \"king of rising Chu\") and aimed to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Although Chen Sheng's uprising was crushed by Qin imperial forces, other rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty and restore the former six states conquered by Qin about two decades ago. The leader of the Chu insurgent state, Xiang Liang, was advised by Fan Zeng to seek a member of the Chu royal family and install him on the throne to garner more support from the people. Xiang Liang found Xiong Xin, who was living as a shepherd, and installed him on the throne in the summer of 208 BC. Xiong Xin ruled under the title of \"King Huai II of Chu\".\n\nKing Huai II was effectively a puppet ruler because the power of Chu was concentrated in Xiang Liang's hands. However, after Xiang Liang was killed at the Battle of Dingtao in the winter of 208 BC, King Huai II seized the control of the armies of two Chu generals, Xiang Yu and Lü Chen, and gradually began to assert his authority. After that, the king ordered Song Yi and Liu Bang to lead two armies to attack Qin, and promised to award the title \"King of Guanzhong\" to whoever entered Guanzhong (the Qin heartland) first. Xiang Liang's nephew, Xiang Yu, was the second-in-command to Song Yi, who led his army to attack Qin forces led by Zhang Han. Zhang Han's army was besieging Handan, the capital of the Zhao state, and Song Yi refused to advance any further to assist the Zhao forces. Xiang Yu took Song Yi by surprise in a meeting, falsely accused him of treason, killed him and usurped his command. He then sent a messenger to inform King Huai II, who reluctantly approved his command. In the winter of 207 BC, Liu Bang arrived in Guanzhong first, before Xiang Yu. The last Qin ruler, Ziying, surrendered to Liu Bang and brought an end to the Qin dynasty.\n\nAccording to the promise made earlier by King Huai II, Liu Bang should rightfully become the \"King of Guanzhong\", but after Xiang Yu reached Guanzhong, he wrote a letter to King Huai II to ask the king to give him the title instead. King Huai II's reply was to the effect of \"per my earlier promise\", but Xiang Yu ignored him and took control of Guanzhong from Liu Bang since he was more militarily powerful than Liu. Xiang Yu then proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, each ruled by one of the leaders of the rebel forces which overthrew the Qin dynasty. He also promoted King Huai II to a seemingly more \"honourable\" title – Emperor Yi of Chu. However, later, he had the puppet emperor relocated to Chen County (郴縣; in present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), thereby effectively sending the emperor into exile.\n\nEmperor Yi was aware that Xiang Yu wanted to force him into exile, so he feigned illness and used that as an excuse to postpone his trip to Chen County, but to no avail. Xiang Yu still forced him to make his way from Pengcheng (彭城; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to Chen County. At the same time, he secretly ordered Ying Bu, Wu Rui and Gong Ao to kill the emperor during the journey to Chen County. Emperor Yi was murdered by Ying Bu's men near Chen County and buried by the locals at a hill in the southwest of the county.\n\nBetween 206–202 BC, a power struggle for supremacy over China (historically known as the Chu–Han Contention) broke out between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. Liu Bang used Emperor Yi's death as political propaganda to justify his war against Xiang Yu. In 205 BC, he held a three-day memorial service for the emperor, accused Xiang Yu of committing regicide, and rally support from the people against Xiang Yu. In 202 BC, the Chu–Han Contention concluded with victory for Liu Bang, who became the sovereign ruler of China and established the Han dynasty. Liu Bang ordered his generals Zhou Bo, Wang Ling and Fan Kuai, who had been enfeoffed as marquises, to conduct memorial services for Emperor Yi in their respective marquisates.\n\nYi sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with the last Qin ruler Ziying.\n\n\n"}

The museum's collection is rare because most of the aircraft are flyable. Located at Ellington Airport, the museum is housed on about 100,000 ft (10,000 m) of property, including its own airport ramp. The museum, formerly located in Galveston, moved to Houston to avoid a repeat of the devastation suffered during Hurricane Ike.\n\nThe museum began as a private collection of historic aircraft in 1985. By 1990, that collection had grown enough that its owner decided to place them on public display. The Lone Star Flight Museum, a non-profit organization funded entirely through private donations, was formed for that purpose.\n\nThe museum reported heavy damage from Hurricane Ike, stating on September 16, 2008, that the hangars and Hall of Fame had received seven to eight feet of water and the lobby three to four. Damaged aircraft included a B-58A and F-100 on loan from the US Air Force Museum, Consolidated PBY-5A, Dehavilland DH-82A, Grumman F3F-2, Lockheed PV-2D, and Stinson L-5. Aircraft flown out of harm's way in advance included their B-17, B-25, DC-3, P-47, F6F, F4U, SBD, PT-17, T-6 and the F8F. Most of the airworthy planes were flown out of the museum prior to the hurricane. Those remaining as well as the static displays were largely destroyed or heavily damaged. The B-58 went to Little Rock Air Force Base. The PBY-5A went to the Pima Air & Space Museum.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Hurricane Ike, the museum made the decision to move to Ellington International Airport in Houston. It is working with the Collings Foundation and Texas Flying Legends to create a combined aviation museum complex. In March 2014, the museum received $7.6 million from FEMA. The museum broke ground at its new location on November 9, 2015. Initially scheduled to be dedicated on September 1, 2017, the opening was postponed to September 16 due to Hurricane Harvey.\n\nOn October 23, 2013 a P-51 (TF-51) Mustang owned by the museum crashed in Halls Lake, just south west of the museum. Both the pilot and a paying passenger from the UK were killed in the crash.\n\nThe museum's collection often participates in airshows across the country. As of 2005, the museum's aircraft annually log more than 40,000 miles (60,000 km) of cross-country flying to various air demonstrations.\n\nThe museum's P-47 Thunderbolt participates in USAF Heritage Flights throughout the year. The USAF Heritage Flight program was established in 1997 to commemorate the Air Force's 50th anniversary. It involves today's state-of-the-art fighters flying in close formation with World War II, Korean and Vietnam era fighters such as the P-51 Mustang and the F-86 Sabre. The flight's mission is to safely and proudly display the evolution of US Air Force airpower and to support the Air Force's recruiting and retention efforts.\n\nThe museum's North American B-25 Mitchell also serves closely with the Disabled American Veterans program. The DAV Airshow Outreach Program was developed to increase public awareness of disabled veterans and to serve veterans in communities across the nation. Using two B-25 medium bombers, the program reminds the public of the sacrifices veterans have made.\n\nIn 2007, the museum launched its newest program by offering rides in some of its warbirds. The LSFM now operates flights for passengers in the B-17 Flying Fortress, North American B-25 Mitchell, T-6 Texan and the PT-17 Stearman.\n\nThe Museum also has a flying Douglas DC-3 in the paint scheme of Continental Airlines. The Museum’s DC-3 was produced in 1940 and flew seven years for American Airlines. It was later bought by TransTexas Airways, which would later acquire Continental Airlines. When Gordon Bethune, CEO of Continental Airlines, was inducted into the TAHF in 2004, Continental Airlines donated the aircraft to the Flight Museum.\n\nThe Texas Aviation Hall of Fame, located within the museum, honors the contributions of residents or natives of Texas to aviation and spaceflight. Inductees include Howard Hughes, Gordon Bethune, Emma Carter Browning, Alan Bean, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Azellia White and President George H. W. Bush.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He opposed American entry into World War I as well as the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. Lindbergh is best known as the father of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh.\n\nLindbergh was born Carl Månsson, in Stockholm, Sweden, to Louisa Carlén, the 19-year-old mistress of Ola Månsson, a peasant member of the Riksdag of the Estates and a bank manager. When accused of bribery and embezzlement, Ola Månsson changed his name to August Lindbergh, left his wife and seven children, and emigrated to the United States with his mistress and their illegitimate infant son, Carl, in 1859. Lovisa became Louisa and young Carl became Charles August Lindbergh.\n\nThey settled in Melrose, Minnesota and had six more children together. August worked as a farmer and a blacksmith for 26 years before marrying Louisa in 1885, having become a widower in 1864 with the death of his first wife in Sweden.\n\nCharles August Lindbergh studied law at the University of Michigan Law School, graduating in 1883, and was admitted to the bar that same year.\n\nLindbergh served as prosecuting attorney for Morrison County, Minnesota from 1891 to 1893. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1906 as a Republican, serving in the 60th, 61st, 62nd, 63rd, and 64th congresses. In 1912, he supported Theodore Roosevelt's unsuccessful third party Progressive bid for the White House. In 1916 he unsuccessfully campaigned for a seat in the United States Senate.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, Lindbergh was vocal that the United States should not become involved. In 1916 he lost his United States Senate bid to an opponent who openly advocated American intervention in Europe. In March 1917, Lindbergh was one of only 14 congressmen to vote against the arming of United States merchant ships. By 1917, the third year of the Great War, Lindbergh's son was aged 16, which meant some possibility of conscription.\n\nIn Congress, Lindbergh was one of the first outspoken critics of the Federal Reserve. His stature grew when he was featured in an article in \"The American Magazine\": \"It was a Swede from Minnesota who first raised in Congress the hue-and-cry of the Money Trust Hunt-'a Swede who dreams,'a fellow member described him-Charles A. Lindbergh.\" Lindbergh declared, \"This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth. When the President signs this bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalized, the people may not know it immediately, but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed ... The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill.\" In 1917 Lindbergh brought articles of impeachment against members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, including Paul Warburg and William P. G. Harding, charging that they were involved \"... in a conspiracy to violate the Constitution and laws of the United States ...\"\n\nIn 1913 Lindbergh published \"Banking, Currency, and the Money Trust\". He also wrote an anti-war polemic titled \"Why is Your Country at War?\". In 1918, under the Comstock laws federal agents destroyed the printing plates, along with \"Banking, Currency and the Money Trust,\" which attacked the Federal Reserve and big banks. The former was later posthumously released in 1934, under the title, \"Your Country at War, and What Happens to You After a War\" In the first chapter, he wrote, \"It is impossible according to the big press to be a true American unless you are pro-British. If you are really for America first, last and all time, and solely for America and for the masses primarily, then you are classed as pro-German by the big press which is supported by the speculators.\" These beliefs would influence his son, who would later famously oppose American intervention in World War II.\n\nIn 1918, Lindbergh ran for Governor of Minnesota as a Republican against the Republican incumbent, Joseph A. A. Burnquist. Lindbergh was endorsed by the Farmers Nonpartisan League, which called for government ownership of some agricultural enterprises, such as mills, plants, and grain elevators. Many of his campaign speeches were attended by thousands of supporters. But due to his opposition to American entry into the first World War and his connection to the Socialistic Farmers Nonpartisan League, Lindbergh was attacked by the press and there were often protestors who pelted him with eggs and rocks. Lindbergh's son Charles worked as his driver and \"never forgot the hostile crowds that harassed his father, or the way the press derided him.\" Lindbergh's 1918 bid for governor ultimately failed. In 1924, Lindbergh was once again a candidate for governor on the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party ticket. Lindbergh's campaign was cut short by his death. He would have been the first Minnesota governor from the party if he had been elected.\n\nIn 1887, Lindbergh married Mary LaFond, with whom he had two daughters, Lillian and Eva. Mary LaFond died in 1898. In 1901, Charles married Evangeline Lodge Land (1876–1954). In 1902, they settled in Little Falls, Minnesota, where Lindbergh established a successful law practice. Evangeline often had difficulty raising her two step-daughters, who both eventually moved away. Evangeline often threatened Lindbergh with divorce, who caved in to her demands, fearing a divorce would cost him his seat in congress. After further problems, Evangeline began to live in a separate residence in 1909. They separated in 1918, their only child being the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, who also became an antiwar leader.\n\nCharles August Lindbergh died in 1924 in Crookston, Minnesota of brain cancer. He has a memorial plaque in the columbarium at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. According to his wishes, son Charles scattered his ashes near Sauk River over the place where the first Lindbergh home once stood.\n\n\n"}

In 1932 it was given town status and named Melchor Ocampo, after politician Melchor Ocampo. On April 12, 1937, during the governorship of José María Mendoza Prado, the state congress decreed the creation of the municipality of Melchor Ocampo del Balsas. The name of the municipality changed again on November 17, 1970, to Lázaro Cárdenas, in honor of the popular former president who had died the previous month.\n\nIn 2006, steelworkers working in a steel plant went on strike, causing numerous injuries and deaths.\n\nIn July 2007, a ship was caught by Mexican officials at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, which originated from Hong Kong, after traveling through the Port of Long Beach with 19 tons of pseudoephedrine, a raw material needed for the manufacturing process of the drug methamphetamine. The Chinese owner Zhenli Ye Gon was found to have $206 million at his Mexico City mansion. It went undetected at Long Beach.\n\nThe city is served by the Lázaro Cárdenas Airport.\n\nLázaro Cárdenas is home to a deepwater seaport that handles container, dry bulk, and liquid cargo. The port also exports automobiles from various Mexican assembly plants to markets in southeast Asia and South America. The port handled 1.24 million TEU in 2012 and is expanding to a capacity of 2.2 million TEU annually. Cargo moves to and from the port by road and rail equally, with rail service provided exclusively by Kansas City Southern de México. The port is expected to become a major container facility due to congestion at the U.S. ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and its relative proximity to major cities such as Chicago, Kansas City, and Houston. In preparation for the port's increased capacity, railway and highway infrastructure running north–south through the center of Mexico has been upgraded to handle the anticipated increase in volume of goods bound for the United States using this transportation corridor. If a proposed government-backed Pacific port is built at Punta Colonet, Baja California, goods flowing to U.S. states like Arizona and Nevada could bypass the congested Los Angeles region with closer access to those markets, providing increased competition with Lázaro Cárdenas.\n\n"}
{"id": "2313628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313628", "title": "Ferrante Pallavicino", "text": "Ferrante Pallavicino\n\nFerrante Pallavicino (23 March 1615 – 5 March 1644) was an Italian writer of numerous antisocial and obscene stories and novels with biblical and profane themes, lampoons and satires in Venice which, according to Edward Muir, \"were so popular that booksellers and printers bought them from him at a premium.\" Pallavicino's scandalous satires, which cost him his head at the age of twenty-eight, were all published under pseudonyms or anonymously.\n\nPallavicino was born in Piacenza, Italy, a member of the old Italian family of the Pallavicini. He received a good education at Padua and elsewhere, and early in life entered the Augustinian order, residing chiefly in Venice. For a year he accompanied the general Ottavio Piccolomini in his German campaigns as field chaplain, and in 1641, shortly after his return, he published a number of clever but exceedingly scurrilous satires on the Roman Curia and on the powerful house of the Barberini, held together by the frame story expressed in its title, \"Il Corriero svaligiato\" (\"The Post-boy Robbed of his Bag\"). In this novella published in 1641, four courtiers read and comment on a post-bag of letters that their noble master has ordered stolen from a courier, which include some political ones written by the Spanish governor of Milan. The basis of his story allowed Pallavicino to express a number of divergent opinions, which included those critical of contemporary rulers in Italy, who included Pope Urban VIII Barberini, \"the barber who cut the beard of Christ\"; the Jesuits, who were attempting to monopolize all education and intellectual life; the Roman Inquisition, which ruined publishers through its prosecutions; and the Spanish, who at the time occupied parts of Italy. \"The only powers to escape condemnation in the letters\", according to Muir, \"were the valiant republics, Genoa, Lucca, and especially Venice, which had managed to maintain political independence.\"\n\nThe reaction to this work was immediate: the papal nuncio to Venice, Francesco Vitelli, demanded Pallavicino's arrest; although the writer spent six months in prison, his allies kept him from being tried. In March 1642, the pro-papal party in the Venetian Senate proposed legislation to banish Pallavicino and forbid the sale of \"Il Corriero\", but despite receiving four votes the measure failed to pass. In spite of these successes, after his release from prison Pallavicini was persecuted by the papal nuncio and Francesco Barberini, Pope Urban's nephew. \"Twice Pallavicino was forced to leave his monastery and take refuge with Loredan,\" writes Muir, \"and during the summer of 1642 he escaped Venice, traveling home to Parma, to Friuli, and back to Parma, only to return in August to see a woman.\"\n\nDespite these travails, Pallavicino continued his satiric attacks on the Pope. In the 18 months following the publication of \"Il Corriero\", he wrote four more books. In 1642 appeared his \"Baccinata ouero battarella per le api barberine\", a \"Drumming against the Barberini bees, on the occasion of Our Lord Pope Urban the Eighth taking up arms against Parma\" in the First War of Castro against Odoardo Farnese, duke of Parma and Castro. It was the country folk's practice to make a racket on pots and pans (\"baccinata\") in order to disperse a swarm of bees — the heraldic emblem of the Barberini — that were settling in an undesirable place. The \"Baccinata\" took the form of a letter to Francesco Vitelli, papal nuncio at Venice, comparing the papal actions unfavourably with those of Christ:\nChrist shed his own blood, and Our Lord sheds the blood of others and promises eternal life to those who shed the most Christian blood... and if the shepherd is only permitted a thin rod with which to control the sheepfold, or better still, nothing at all, as Christ said to the Apostles, 'Do not carry any rod with you on the way', what can be said of Our Lord and Pastor, who scatters the herd of the Church with swords, guns, arquebuses and cannons?\"\n\nEven more notorious was \"La Retorica delle puttane\" (\"The Rhetoric of Whores\"), which Muir describes as a \"scandalous anti-Jesuit work\", which \"demonstrates why Pallavicino was the only Italian author of his epoch capable of a coherent vision that integrated satire, skepticism, and naturalistic morality.\" \"La Retorica\" is written in the form of a dialogue between an aged prostitute and her naive apprentice. The older woman is sick, poor, and miserable because, she explains, she \"did not know to stop at rhetoric, wanting to go on to learn philosophy.\" Muir explains, \"By 'rhetoric,' she means the arts of simulation and dissimulation, which would have brought her pleasure and riches, without danger, while philosophy, with its pretension to discovering truth, has brought her the ruin of emotional authenticity.\" The fifteen lessons of the old whore were based on Cipriano Suarez's \"De arte rhetorica\", the manual used in Jesuit schools. Muir pointedly notes, \"By systematically pursuing the parallels between rhetorical persuasion and erotic seduction, Pallavicino demonstrates how the high art of rhetoric has the same instrumental character as the lowly deceptions of the prostitute.\"\n\n\"La Retorica delle puttane\" (1643) proved to be a step too far, and in the autumn of 1643 Pallavicino had to flee Venice for Bergamo, where he completed the first volume of his last work, \"Il Divortio celeste\" (\"The Celestial Divorce\"), published in 1643, which Muir reports \"came to be known, in the words of a contemporary, as 'superior to all others in impiety and blasphemies against the Roman Church.'\" In this proposed trilogy, Pallavicino had portrayed Jesus Christ as seeking to divorce himself from the Roman Catholic Church (widely known then as the \"bride of Christ\"), for committing intolerable adulteries and for living a sinful life. God then sends Saint Paul to investigate these claims, and based on his findings, he recommends that Christ's request be granted. Although the only completed volume of the series ends at this point, according to Muir the story was continued \"with an account of how Luther, Calvin, and Mark of Ephesus (the 15th-century Greek theologian who had opposed the unification of the Greek and Roman churches) offered their own churches as the new bride of Christ. After considering their suitability for matrimony, Christ was to have demurred, stating that he did not intend to wed any of the existing churches.\" A copy of Pallavicino's manuscript found its way to Geneva, where it was published. \"Il Divortio\" became a sensation in Italy (where Muir notes it was sold \"under the counter\"), and was plagiarized in Protestant countries, where German, Swedish, French, Dutch and English translations appeared.\n\nIt was in Bergamo that the son of an Italian bookseller in Paris, Charles de Breche – who, as a paid agent of the Barberini had befriended Pallavicino a few years before – convinced him that Cardinal Richelieu greatly admired his works and wanted to commission Pallavicino to serve as the cardinal's official historian if he were to come to France. Despite the fact that Richelieu died while the two were en route to Paris, de Breche convinced Pallavicino to continue the journey, and as they were crossing one of the bridges at Orange in the neighborhood of Avignon, a papal enclave within France, there de Breche betrayed him to the local papal authorities. After fourteen months' imprisonment, during which time he wrote a letter to Francesco Barberini, begging for clemency but also during which his \"Il Divortio\" was also published in Geneva, with unlucky timing, Pallavicino was beheaded at Avignon.\n\nHis enemies did not long survive Pallavicino. Five months later, Pope Urban was dead; within two years de Breche was stabbed to death in Paris by a certain Ganducci, but as Muir comments, \"whether or not in revenge for Pallavicino's death is unknown.\" When a brief life was appended to a selection of his works that included a continuation of the \"Corriero\", the author, Girolamo Brusoni, remained discreetly anonymous. Pallavicino's scandalous reputation continued until the end of the century and inspired satires of Antonio Lupis, Carlo Moscheni, Gregorio Leti and Alain René Lesage. Often a free-thinking individual named \"Ferrante\" appears in their satiric dialogues.\n\nPallavicino was a prolific writer in his truncated career. A bibliography of his scattered works and ephemera and a rigorous chronology of their numerous reprints and translations was compiled by Laura Coci, \"Bibliografia di Ferrante Pallavicino\", \"Studi secenteschi\" 24 (1983:221-306).\n"}

Alcoholism claimed her life in April 2002 when she died of cirrhosis of the liver, 14 years after her last appearance.\n\nAlcoholic Angie shares a stormy marriage with her womanising husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), and refuses to let him go even during their rockiest times. They run and live in The Queen Victoria public house on Albert Square. Angie and Den doted on their teenage adoptive daughter, Sharon (Letitia Dean) - who carries on loving them despite her resentment of Den's affairs and Angie's binge drinking. Angie is good at putting on a front for the customers, dressing to kill, screeching outrageously with the girls, but inside she is crippled with depression. Despite all her bravado, all she really wants is a happy marriage with Den, despite the fact that he treats her terribly and has endless affairs with other women.\n\nDuring 1985, Den and Angie celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary but it soon becomes clear that their marriage is a sham. Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, there is not much of a relationship. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie is all too aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie does what she always does in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe Sharon to ensure her silence, and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday with Jan, Angie calls off the affair with Tony, but it is not long before Sharon gives Den the impression that Angie has been unfaithful. Den confronts Angie, and she admits to her and Tony's affair, but unfortunately for her, Den is not concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.\n\nAlthough Angie tries to stop drinking, her attempts always fail dismally and by the end of the year, she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequently visit The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Den and Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of alcohol and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair, this time with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing matters on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry), following an affair with Sharon's best friend, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies after being struck by a lorry shortly afterwards.\n\nAs the year moves on, Den decides that he wants to leave Angie so he can marry Jan. He finally gets round to telling Angie his intentions in October, after which Angie becomes distraught. Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again, having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day 1986, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it. In response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags and walk out of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.\nIn 1987, Angie secures herself a job as the manager of The Queen Vic's rival drinking establishment, The Dagmar. Owner, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), is only too happy to have Angie's expertise on board for his new, suave wine bar. Angie and Den continue to row constantly and in a bid for revenge, Angie vows to take Den \"to the cleaners\" for her divorce settlement. In retaliation, Den installs Jan as the new landlady of The Queen Vic, which only infuriates Angie even more. However, Den and Jan's cohabitation eventually leads to the end of their relationship, when Den decides that Jan is too posh for him, and so by the summer of that year orders her to leave.\n\nThe Queen Vic is floundering without Angie, a fact that she seems to delight over, and the sheer pleasure of watching Den suffer is all she needs to make her \"grin and bear\" The Dagmar's yuppie clientele. However, behind her front, Angie is a wreck, drinking more heavily than ever and going on \"over the top\" shopping sprees. By May 1987, the divorce papers finally come through, but it seems that neither Den nor Angie are coping without each other, and although they both profess to be pleased about the divorce, it is obvious to everyone else that they are far from happy. Seeing her parents' misery, Sharon decides to intervene by setting up a dinner date between them, which ends with them having sex. Angie and Den decide to keep their brief reconciliation quiet. By the end of the year, Angie finally loses her patience with The Dagmar clientele, and after punching one of the customers in the face, she leaves town for a couple of days. Upon her return, she is in great pain, but hides it and marches over to The Queen Vic during the New Year's Eve celebrations and offers to come back to work, but only as Den's business partner and not his wife.\n\nIn 1988, Angie is rushed to hospital with kidney failure brought on by her excessive alcohol abuse. Upon her recovery, Angie decides to take a well-earned holiday to Spain with her friends, Sonny and Ree. This leads to Angie and Sonny falling in love and embarking on an affair. Sonny makes arrangements for them to start a new life together, running a bar in Spain.\n\nAngie returns to Walford, with her plans still secret, and tries to show interest in Den's plan to move the location of The Queen Vic, but it is plain to see that her mind is elsewhere. Den soon realises that she is seeing someone else, and although he does not care that she is with another man, he is concerned for the state of his business. Den visits a solicitor and returns with papers protecting himself and his business should Angie decide to leave him again. Angie decides to leave in May 1988, still under a cloak of secrecy and only divulging her plan to leave on the night of her departure. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cruelly informs her that he has arranged things so that she won't be able to get a penny out of him. After their final showdown, Angie gets into her taxi and leaves Walford. This is Angie's last appearance.\n\nLater that year, while Den is in prison, Sharon decides to join Angie in Spain and arrives unannounced, only to learn from Sonny that Angie has left him and moved to the United States. It is subsequently revealed that she moved to Miami where she remarries in February 1991. Sharon joins Angie in 1995 after the breakdown of her marriage to Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp).\n\nIn May 2001, Sharon returns to Walford, and in April 2002, news reaches Walford that Angie has died. Sharon brings Angie's body back to Walford to be buried in the local cemetery. After the funeral ceremony, Sharon confides in Angie's closest surviving friends, Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), that years of heavy drinking finally caught up with Angie and she died a slow painful decline due to cirrhosis of the liver, having also experienced alcohol-related dementia. Sharon emotionally explains Angie asked her to give the pretence of a heart attack when the time came. Despite having remarried, Angie had requested to be buried next to Den, which Sharon does for her when she returns the body to London in order to reunite her two deceased parents. Sharon's new club is renamed Angie's Den in honour of her parents.\n\nDen was supposedly shot dead by a mystery hitman in February 1989. However, the body thought to be Den's is actually that of the mysterious Mr. Vinnicombe, the boss of The Firm, who ordered Den's assassination. Fourteen years after Den's disappearance, it is revealed that he had not died after all, but had faked his own death in order to escape the gangsters who had been employed to kill him. However, Den does die at the hands of his second wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in February 2005, after being bludgeoned to death with Pauline's doorstop. A body found under the basement of The Queen Vic six months later is quickly identified as Den's, and he is buried in the grave next to Angie.\n\nAngie Watts was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Angie was originally going to be named Pearl and she, her husband and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as The Queen Vic. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in. Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more 'real'. The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the shows success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.\n\nAngie's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\". In this passage, Angie will be referred to as Pearl, her husband as Jack, her daughter as Tracey and her dog as Prince (known now as Den, Sharon and Roly respectively).\n\nThe actress Jean Fennell was recommended for the part by the director Matthew Robinson. Fennell was born in the East End of London and both Holland and Smith considered her to have unique qualities to her personality, which combined \"vitality and vulnerability, and an almost desperate nervous energy\" - all of which were perfect for Angie. Fennell was given the role, however during rehearsals Holland and Smith began to realise that Fennell was wrong for the part, and Smith made the decision to re-cast the role of Angie. With only four days to the first studio recording of \"EastEnders\", Smith set about finding a suitable actress. Smith had taught the actress Anita Dobson many years earlier and remembered her as \"sharp, brittle, very theatrical, with a vitality that was almost intense and a range of emotions that were alarming considering her youth\", but was worried she was too young for the part. However, when Dobson was brought in for an audition it was noted she was \"exactly the right age\" after all. After a very successful reading Dobson was cast as Angie.\n\nThe Watts were the surprise hit characters of the show. Angie and Den were a live-wire couple whose on/off relationship made the Queen Vic pub exciting and unpredictable and millions of viewers tuned in to watch the destruction of their relationship on-screen. Den's clashes with Angie brought \"EastEnders\" to a peak of popularity and toppled rival soap \"Coronation Street\" from the top of the ratings chart.\nDuring 1986 the series became dominated by Angie and Den's storylines and the focus of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress Jan Hammond. Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year. Her menacing voice at the end of the telephone severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide. Dobson had been opposed to the suicide storyline from the beginning, she fought hard to get the scripts changed but she was eventually persuaded to play the scenes and was applauded for a \"brilliant performance\". However Angie's suicide attempt provoked a massive reaction, not all of it favourable. There was a public outcry about the last two shots of the suicide episode, and Julia Smith subsequently had to cut one of them for the omnibus edition. Some accused the programme of sensationalising suicide and giving ideas to copy-cats. The buildup to Angie's desperate action and its sickening aftermath were intended to demonstrate the full despair of her situation and Holland and Smith have maintained that the horror of its on-screen depiction was meant to deter, not encourage, the act.\n\nDen and Angie's traumatic two-hander episode in October 1986 was a risky experiment. A thirty-minute episode with only two people in it had never been attempted in a soap before. Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did. Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a \"tennis match\" between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window-cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but eventually Angie's hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a big lie. Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered to be one of the finest episodes in \"EastEnders\" catalogue.\n\nThe Den/Angie/Jan triangle was to continue for many months. The climax was a trip to Venice when Angie, convinced that Den had finished with his mistress, was taken there for a second-honeymoon, returning to London on the Orient Express. This gave the writers and producers an opportunity to open the show up from the confines of Albert Square. However the trip to Venice was fraught with problems and Dobson, Leslie Grantham (Den) and Jane How (Jan) were hounded by the press at all times. Their photographs appeared in British newspapers, thus ruining the shock surprise that Tony Holland had created, by including Den's mistress in the episode. Despite huge efforts from all involved the Venice episodes were only moderately successful, although the revelations discovered by Den in the episode set the scene for one of \"EastEnders\" most renowned episodes, which aired on Christmas Day that year. After over-hearing his wife confess that her illness was fabricated, Den filed for divorce. 30.1 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day in 1986 to witness Den handing Angie her divorce papers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be beaten by any other plotline from any other soap in the UK.\n\nThis storyline saw the separation of Den and Angie. Holland and Smith had anticipated that Den and Angie would be popular, but they had not guessed how hysterical the reaction to them would be. It was decided that Den and Angie would have to be played down for a while so that other characters would have the opportunity to shine through. The next few years saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other and eventually they reunited as business partners. However, in 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years playing Angie. She left in May 1988. Despite many alleged attempts at getting Dobson to reprise the role, she never accepted, commenting: \"Why tarnish the gorgeous creation that was Angie Watts?\". The character of Angie Watts was subsequently killed off-screen in 2002 (dying of a drink related illness) and brought home to be buried by her on-screen daughter Sharon in order to facilitate the return of the actress Letitia Dean. In 2010, Dobson said she was glad her character was killed off, as it was unrealistic that the character would ever return.\n\nIn February 2011 Dobson said that she had no regrets being in \"EastEnders\", as it propelled her to fame, and said she believed that people were drawn to Angie because she is a survivor and funny—qualities that drew Dobson herself to Angie. She said \"[Angie] could be on the floor, drunk, weeping buckets, mascara everywhere, then drag herself up the next morning in that old blue dressing gown, tidy herself up and be in the bar that night telling jokes and looking a million dollars.\"\n\nKellie Bright who plays Linda Carter has said that she has based her portrayal on that of Dobson and Angie.\n\nAngie became one of the most iconic and popular characters in \"EastEnders\" history. The character was said to become such a \"phenomenon\" that when Anita Dobson announced she would be leaving in 1988, her departure was reported on the \"BBC Six O'Clock News\".\n\nShe was voted the number one television barmaid, the fifth most popular \"Queen of soaps\" and the 75th greatest television character of all time in separate Channel 4 polls. In addition, the moment that Den served Angie divorce papers has been voted the number one soap moment of all time in a 2004 poll.\n\n"}
{"id": "2313636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313636", "title": "Notional amount", "text": "Notional amount\n\nThe notional amount (or notional principal amount or notional value) on a financial instrument is the nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as \"notional.\"\n\nContrast a bond with an interest rate swap:\n\nIn simple terms the notional principal amount is essentially how much of the asset or bonds a person has. For example, if a premium bond was bought for £1 then the notional principal amount would be the face value amount of premium bond that your £1 was able to purchase. Hence the notional principal amount is the quantity of the assets and bonds.\n\nIn the context of an interest rate swap, the notional principal amount is the specified amount on which the exchanged interest payments are based; this could be 8000 US dollars, or 2.7 million pounds sterling, or any other combination of a number and a currency. Each period's rates are multiplied by the notional principal amount to determine the height and currency of each counter-party's payment. A notional principal amount is the amount used as a reference to calculate the amount of interest due on an 'interest only class' which is not entitled to any principal.\n\nIn a typical total return swap, one party pays a fixed or floating rate multiplied by a notional principal amount plus the depreciation, if any, in a notional amount of property in exchange for payments by the other party of the appreciation, if any, on the same notional amount of property. For example, assume the underlying property is the S&P 500 stock index. A would pay B LIBOR times a $100 notional amount plus depreciation, if any, on a $100 notional investment in the S&P 500 index. B would pay A the appreciation, if any, in the same notional S&P 500 investment.\n\nShares also have a notional principal amount but it is called \"nominal\" instead of notional.\n\nIf you are buying stock option contracts, for example, those contracts could potentially give you a lot more shares than you could control by buying shares outright. So the notional value is the value of what you control rather than the value of what you own.\n\nSo, for instance, if you purchase a 100 share equity call option with a strike of $60 for a stock that is currently trading at $60, then you have the same upside potential as someone who holds $6,000 of stock (1 option × 100 multiplier × $60), but you may have paid only $5/share (for a total of $500), so by this measure you have achieved leverage of $6,000/$500 = 12\"x\". Note that if the stock price moves to $70, your dollar notional is now $7,000 (– cost of option and commission differential), but your quantity (unit notional) is still 1 contract.\n\nIn FX derivatives, such as forwards or options, there are \"two\" notionals.\nSuppose you have a call option on USD/JPY struck at 110, and you buy one of these. Then this gives you the option to pay 100 USD and receive 110 × 100 = 11,000 JPY, so the USD notional is 100 USD, and the JPY notional is 11,000 JPY. \n\nNote that the ratio of notionals is exactly the strike, and thus if you move the strike, you must change one or the other notional. For instance, if you move the strike to 100, then if you hold the USD fixed at 100, the JPY notional becomes 10,000: you will pay the same number of USD, and receive fewer JPY. Alternatively, you could hold JPY constant at 11,000 and change the USD notional to 110: you pay more USD and receive the same number of JPY (you've changed the price of JPY, denominated in USD).\n\nWhen hedging a foreign currency exposure, (say for an American USD business, an outflow of 11,000 JPY) it is the \"foreign currency\" notional that must be fixed.\n\nExchange-traded funds track underlying positions, so an investment performs equivalently to purchasing that number of physical positions, though the fund may in fact not directly purchase the positions, and instead use derivatives (especially futures) to produce the position.\n\nLevered ETFs, notably inverse exchange-traded funds, have the unusual property that their notional changes every day: this is because they pay the compounded daily return, so it is as if one were re-investing each day's earnings at the new daily price: if one has an inverse ETF in an asset that goes down, one has more money, which one uses to short a cheaper asset, hence one's unit notional goes up, and conversely if the asset has gone up in value. See inverse exchange-traded fund for mathematical details.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1946 by Irving Fiske, a playwright, writer, and public speaker; and his wife, Barbara Hall Fiske, an artist and one of the few female cartoonists of the Golden Age of Comic Books.\n\nOn April 10, 1946, the Fiskes bought of mountain, meadow, and brook land in Rochester, Vermont. Their intention was to create an artists’ and writers’ retreat, a gathering place for creative and freethinking people.\n\nWhen the countercultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s began, hundreds of people from all over the world began to discover Quarry Hill. Many people built houses at Quarry Hill, with an agreement with the Fiskes that the land would continue to be owned by the family. Children at Quarry Hill and attended its private K-12 school, the North Hollow School. The school was based on the principles of the Fiske family and of Summerhill School in England, and ran Free The Kids! Program, which offers educational material on the self-destructive and negative effect on children of spanking and other violence.\n\nOne of the residents of Quarry Hill was the late Stephen Huneck, who lived there during the mid- to late-1960s. Huneck later became a folk artist, who\ncreated the famous Dog Church in St. Johnsbury, VT with many carved dog images. He often said Barbara Fiske was one of his art teachers; William Fiske (1954-2008), the Fiskes' son, was one of his closest friends; and he called Isabella Fiske McFarlin till almost the end of his life (he committed suicide in 2010). Another resident who has achieved prominence is Alan Stirt, woodworker and bowlmaker.\n\nIn 1976, Irving and Barbara divorced, and a family-owned rental corporation, Lyman Hall, Inc., took over the land.\nWilliam Fiske was its first President, a position now held by Brion T. McFarlin, who on October 14, 1984 married Isabella Fiske in Brandon, VT. William Fiske was married to Anne Fitzgerald for 10 years, and had two children Jason D. Us and Eva Isabel Us. He died on July 18, 2008, in his sleep, in Burlington, VT. Barbara Fiske married Donald W. Calhoun, a sociologist, Quaker (as Barbara had become in the 1980s) and professor of sociology at the University of Miami.\n\nIsabella Fiske, the Fiskes' daughter, had become friends with many underground cartoonists in the 1960s, including Trina Robbins, Robert Crumb, Kim Deitch and Art Spiegelman.\n\nIn 1978 Spiegelman, Françoise Mouly, and a number of Quarry Hill residents created Top-Drawer Rubber Stamp Company, a pictorial rubber stamp company featuring art by Crumb, Spiegelman, and many other cartoonists and artists, including Barbara Fiske. This art rubber stamp company provided employment for several Quarry Hill residents.\n\nSpiegelman and others drew a parallel between Irving Fiske and Crumb's mischievous \"Guru\", Mr. Natural.\n\nIrving Fiske died of a stroke on April 25, 1990, in Ocala Florida. Barbara Fiske continued to live and teach art at Quarry Hill into her 90s, eventually moving to a nursing home in White River Junction, Vermont, where she died after several days of being read poetry by her daughter and son-in-law, and by moments of Quaker silence, as Barbara became a member of the Society of Friends in 1982, in Middlebury Vermont.\n\n\n"}

Graham as Jason Voorhees. It is the sixth installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. The film follows Voorhees who, after being accidentally resurrected, stalks another group of camp counselors.\n\nThe original concept called for Tommy Jarvis, the protagonist of \"\" and \"\", to become the new villain, but after the poor fan reception of \"A New Beginning\", the producers brought Jason Voorhees back as the series' antagonist. In resurrecting Jason, McLoughlin made him an explicitly supernatural force for the first time in the series. This version of Jason, an undead and more powerful superhuman, would become the standard depiction for the rest of the series. The film introduced metahumor and action film elements, including shootouts and car chases, into the series.\n\n\"Jason Lives\" was the first in the series to receive some positive reception from critics since the original. In the years since its release, its self-referential humor and numerous instances of breaking the fourth wall have been praised for prefiguring Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven's \"Scream\" series. \"Jason Lives\" is considered a fan favorite of the series, in addition to receiving positive notice from horror film historians. It grossed $19.4 million at the U.S. box office on a budget of $3 million. It is followed by \"\".\n\nPicking up a couple of years after , Tommy Jarvis, who killed mass murderer Jason Voorhees, returns to Crystal Lake, now renamed Forest Green, after being released from the mental institution. Tommy, still suffering from hallucinations ever since with Jason, arrives with his friend Allen Hawes during a thunderstorm, hoping to cremate Jason's body and finally end his hallucinations once and for all. At the cemetery, they exhume Jason's corpse but seeing it causes Tommy to have an audio flashback to killing Jason, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive Jason as an immortal revenant. Jason then kills Hawes with a punch through the heart and retrieves the hockey mask Tommy brought with him.\n\nTommy flees to the sheriff's office to warn the police of Jason's return, but he is caught and arrested. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Mike Garris. The sheriff, who is aware of Tommy's institutionalization and thinks he is imagining Jason, locks Tommy in a cell. On the road, camp counselors Darren Robinson and Lizabeth Mott get lost looking for the camp. They are killed by Jason, who impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him.\n\nThe following morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy Baker, Cort Andrews, and Paula Mott arrive to report Darren and Lizabeth missing. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend, they ignore the warnings, though Megan becomes attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate paintball game; he kills the players for their equipment. During these kills, Jason discovers that he is far stronger than before when he rips off a man's arm.\n\nAt Camp Forest Green, the children arrive, and the teens do their best to run the camp without Darren and Lizabeth. Meanwhile, Garris decides to escort Tommy out of his jurisdiction due to his influence on Megan. Tommy tries to make a run for Jason's grave but finds that the caretaker had covered it up to deny responsibility for it being dug up, and Hawes' body is buried in its place. Tommy is then handcuffed and escorted out of town by Garris, who warns him to never return. That night, Jason murders the caretaker and a nearby couple who witness the murder. Meanwhile, Cort goes out to have sex with a girl named Nikki Parsley, but Jason kills them both. The sheriff's men find the victims' bodies and Garris immediately implicates Tommy in the murders, believing he has gone insane imagining Jason.\n\nTommy contacts Megan and convinces her to help him lure Jason back into Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Jason makes his way to the camp and kills both Sissy and Paula, but refrains from harming the children. Meanwhile, Tommy and Megan are pulled over by Garris. Despite Megan's alibi that she was with Tommy, he does not believe him to be innocent and arrests him, and then goes to the camp to investigate. As Tommy and Megan develop a ruse to trick the watching deputy and escape, Jason kills Garris and two other deputies when they arrive at the camp.\n\nJason is about to kill Megan when Tommy calls to him from the lake; apparently remembering his killer, Jason goes after Tommy instead. Tommy is attacked in a boat in the middle of the lake and ties a boulder around Jason's neck to trap him. Jason fights back, holding Tommy underwater long enough to seemingly drown him. Megan rushes out to save him but is nearly killed when Jason grabs her leg; she turns the boat's activated motor around onto Jason's neck, and he releases her. She takes Tommy back to shore and uses CPR to revive him. Tommy says that it is finally over and Jason is home. Under the water, anchored to the bottom of the lake, Jason is still alive. The final shot of the film is his eye staring off into the water, waiting patiently for .\n\nAlthough the previous film in the series, \"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\", had been a financial success, it had disappointed the series' fans and received some of the worst reviews of any film in the series. In order to prevent further alienating the fans (and thus potentially endangering the series), the producers decided to take the series in a new direction, moving it away from what producer Frank Mancuso Jr. called the \"coarse\" nature of \"A New Beginning\".\n\nTo this end, Mancuso hired Tom McLoughlin, who had directed the successful horror film \"One Dark Night\" but was also known around Hollywood for shopping around various comedy scripts he had written, a dichotomy that appealed to Mancuso. McLoughlin was given free rein on how he would present the story, with the only condition being that he bring back Jason and make him the film's villain.\n\nMcLoughlin decided to take the film in the direction of an old Universal Monsters movie, specifically the 1931 version of \"Frankenstein\", which portrayed the monster as a lumbering killer brought to life by electricity. McLoughlin also drew from vampire lore in order to give Jason a weakness, namely being returned to his \"home soil\"; to achieve this, McLoughlin disregarded the idea presented in \"Part 2\" that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting the idea that Jason has always been some sort of supernatural force. He also decided to retcon the ending of the fifth film, where Tommy Jarvis was a serial killer. In fact, Pam's truck from the fifth film can be seen indicating she is alive. In the \"Tommy Tapes\" for \"\" (2017) written by Adam Green, it's explained that the ending of the fifth film was Tommy's dream.\n\nMcLoughlin further decided to expand the series' thematic scope, incorporating action film elements and postmodern metahumor; when Jason is first encountered in the woods near Crystal Lake, the character Lizbeth comments that she and Darren should flee because she knows about proper conduct to survive a horror film. McLoughlin would further satirize the series itself, as Martin the gravedigger comments on Jason's exhumation, \"Why'd they have to go and dig up Jason?\" before breaking the fourth wall and addressing the camera with the observation, \"Some folks sure got a strange idea of entertainment.\" In addition to \"Frankenstein\", McLoughlin also cited as inspiration his love of Gothic horror, particularly the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and his Catholic upbringing; \"Jason Lives\" features the series' only explicit references to God, and during the climax a praying girl is spared by Jason (a similar scene, in which the same girl prays for Tommy while Megan performs CPR, then mouths \"Thank you\" while looking skyward was deleted from the final cut of the movie, apparently against McLoughlin's wishes; he recalled in the 2009 DVD's director's commentary, \"Somehow it didn't stay in... probably too much sentiment\").\n\nThe decision to retcon the events of \"Part V\" resulted in many members of that film's cast—whose characters had survived—having their contracts to return for a sequel terminated. At one point in time when \"Jason Lives\" was being considered as a direct sequel to \"A New Beginning\" rather than to \"The Final Chapter\", the surviving characters Pam and Reggie from \"A New Beginning\" were to have died in the film's opening moments.\n\nAlthough Mancuso retained control over the film's casting, he deferred to McLoughlin's judgment; the only caveat was that the final girl had to be a \"very attractive blonde\". To fulfill this requirement, McLoughlin chose Jennifer Cooke, based on her performance in the television series \"V\". The role of Hawes, Tommy's would-be sidekick who dies within the first five minutes of the movie, was given to another television veteran, Ron Palillo, famous for the role of Horshack on \"Welcome Back, Kotter\".\n\nJohn Shepherd was initially asked to reprise his role as Tommy Jarvis from the previous film. Shepherd, an evangelical Christian who had reservations about returning to the series based on the atmosphere surrounding \"A New Beginning\", was initially attracted to \"Jason Lives\" based on the scene in which a praying girl is spared by Jason. He ultimately decided to film \"Caught\" and shortly thereafter retired from acting to go to seminary. Thom Matthews, who would take over the mantel of Tommy Jarvis, was chosen for his work in the horror comedy \"Return of the Living Dead\", although McLoughlin himself was unaware of Matthews' horror credentials until after shooting began. Other cast members were culled from actors who McLoughlin had directed before (such as David Kagen, who was also an acting teacher for female lead Jennifer Cooke) and McLoughlin's own family—Jason's first female victim in the film, Lizbeth, was played by McLoughlin's wife, Nancy. In keeping with the series' tradition, the role of Jason was given to a stuntman, Dan Bradley. Bradley, however, was replaced shortly thereafter by C. J. Graham. Bradley's involvement during the paintball scene is kept.\n\nAfter the first day of filming, Mancuso decided that he disliked Bradley's appearance onscreen as Jason. Although the scenes that Bradley filmed—in which Jason kills the paintball playing executives—were kept in the completed picture, the rest of Jason's scenes were performed by C. J. Graham, an area restaurant manager and former soldier. As part of a stage show put on at the restaurant, a magician would hypnotize audience members and place them in a scenario during which they encountered Jason Voorhees; Graham, who stood 6'3 and weighed 250 lbs, was asked to play Jason for the scenario. \"Jason Lives\" special effects coordinator, Martin Becker, was in the audience for one such show, and recommended Graham to Mancuso and McLoughlin. Both men were impressed with Graham's presence, and he was hired to film the remainder of Jason's scenes.\n\n\"Jason Lives\" would become notable for being the only film in the franchise to contain no nudity; the characters in the film's sole sex scene are both fully clothed, a conscious move on McLoughlin's part to distance the series from the notion that the \"Friday the 13th\" films were morality tales in which premarital sex was punished by death. McLoughlin was pressured by the film's producers to have Darcy Demoss remove her shirt during the RV sex scene, but he only suggested the idea to Demoss, who refused.\n\n\"Jason Lives\" was filmed in Covington, Georgia, an area close to Atlanta, GA. The scenes involving the police department and town were filmed in Covington while the camp scenes were filmed at Camp Daniel Morgan outside the city limits of Covington. In the film, Camp Crystal Lake has been renamed Lake Forest Green. Surrounding Camp Daniel Morgan are Smokey the Bear signs asking everyone to \"Keep the Forests Green\".\n\nSome of the climactic moments of the film involving the primary characters in the lake were actually filmed in the swimming pool of McLoughlin's father. Although McLoughlin ruined the pool's filter in the process (it was jammed by gore churned into the water when Jason is hit with the boat propeller), McLoughlin's father was pleased that he could now boast a Hollywood film had been shot in his backyard.\n\nMcLoughlin's attempt to deliver a \"different\" kind of \"Friday the 13th\" film were met with skepticism from the producers. In contrast to the series' other entries, which had to be edited for violence in order to avoid an \"X\" rating, the film's producers requested that McLoughlin add additional gore, violence, and murders to the film. The original cut of the film contained 13 killings as an in-joke; in order to appease the studio, McLoughlin had to add an additional three killings, bringing the total up to 16. These were the killings of Martin the gravedigger, and the recently engaged couple on a nighttime picnic. The scene of Jason killing Martin would later be cited by McLoughlin as one of his favorite parts of the movie for the shot in which the picnicking man suddenly realizes that he's been spotted by Jason, which McLoughlin felt to be the film's scariest moment.\n\nAdditionally, McLoughlin was made to extend Sissy's death, adding the shots of Jason dragging her to the ground and twisting her head off; as originally filmed, Sissy was simply pulled out of the cabin window, and wasn't seen again until Megan finds her head in the squad car.\n\nMcLoughlin also found himself in contention with the producers over how the film should end. In the original script, the movie was supposed to have concluded in the graveyard, with Martin the gravedigger meeting Jason's father, Elias—a heretofore unseen character in the series—with the implication that Elias knows Jason has been resurrected and has come looking for him. The studio balked at the scene, as they did not want the responsibility of having to introduce Elias' backstory in the next installment. Additionally, the added murder of Martin made the scene an impossibility to shoot. This ending would have tied up a continuity error from \"A New Beginning\", when it is mentioned that Jason was cremated; a deleted scene from \"Jason Lives\" had Tommy asking Sheriff Garris why Jason wasn't cremated, as had been planned, at which point Garris informs him that someone paid the city to bury Jason; Elias' handing Martin a wad of money would have indicated that he was the man who paid for Jason's burial. The scene was later storyboarded for inclusion on the film's \"Deluxe Edition\" DVD release, with Bob Larkin reprising his role as Martin to provide voiceover. Elias, like Jason, was scripted to be completely silent.\n\nMcLoughlin ultimately shot three endings, two of which, against his expectations, were not included on the film's DVD release. In one ending, Jason's mask floats to the surface of Crystal Lake, having become detached during his struggle with Megan. In another, Deputy Cologne was seen trying to reach the jail cell keys after having been locked in by Tommy and Megan; the door to the police station opens and the film abruptly ends, indicating that Jason had managed to get free. The producers disliked both of these endings, as each one left Jason's survival ambiguous, and wanted it explicitly shown onscreen that he was still capable of returning for a sequel. As a result, McLoughlin shot the film's used ending, showing a closeup of Jason's open, twitching eye.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Harry Manfredini, who composed the scores to all of the series' previous installments. In addition to the original score, the soundtrack also featured:\n\n\"He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)\" had an accompanying music video, combining clips from the film with new footage featuring Cooper. It is not present on any home video release of the film, but may be viewed on YouTube.\n\nOn January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six \"Friday the 13th\" films. It sold out in less than 24 hours.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives\" opened on August 1, 1986, in 1,610 theaters and grossed $6.7 million in its opening weekend, ranking number two at the US box office. Ultimately, it would go on to gross a total of $19.4 million, ranking at number 46 on the list of the year's top earners.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives\" holds a 52% approval rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 5.02/10. The consensus reads: “\"Friday the 13th: Part VI - Jason Lives\" indeed brings back ol' Voorhees, along with a sense of serviceable braindead fun.”\n\n\"Variety\" describe the film as predictable but \"reasonably slick\". Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a gory waste of time\". Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called it the least offensive film of the most offensive film series ever. Ken Hanke of \"Mountain Xpress\" wrote that it \"may not be exactly a good movie in the strict sense, but it's easily the best in the series\".\n\nA novelization of \"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives\" was written by Simon Hawke in 1986; notably, the novelization features an appearance by a Mr.Voorhees, Jason's father who was originally meant to appear in the film but was cut. The book also includes various flashbacks to Jason's childhood and the backstories of characters such as Tommy and Sheriff Garris are also expanded.\n\n"}

Within the municipality there is one municipal district (\"distritos municipal\"): La Caleta. As of the 2012 census it had 123,510 inhabitants, 70,184 living in the city itself and 53,326 in its rural districts (\"Secciones\").\n\nBoca Chica has a popular beach with the same name, located about 30 kilometers east of Santo Domingo de Guzmán in the south shore of the island of Hispaniola.\n\nBoca Chica was originally developed by Dominican businessman and politician Juan Bautista Vicini Burgos, who established sugar plantations there in the early twentieth century. Vicini was very fond of the place but the golden era of Boca Chica came decades later in the 1950s, when dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo ordered the construction of a modern hotel named \"Hotel Hamaca\", which subsequently became an icon in the area. The hotel became more famous after Trujillo granted political asylum to the dictator Fulgencio Batista after the Cuban Revolution. During the 1950s and the 1960s, prominent families of the Dominican Republic built several summer properties along the beach only accessible by private transportation. \n\nAfter the 1970s, the beach became increasingly more popular and public transportation helped to make Boca Chica a very crowded place; it was no longer a secluded beach for the elites as it had been during the '50s and '60s. The Hamaca hotel was closed after Hurricane David in 1979, and it remained closed and abandoned for more than twenty years which caused an economic decline in the area. It was reopened in the early 1990s, and the beach remains popular among the lower class.\n\nBoca Chica's proximity to the city of Santo Domingo, its clear blue waters and white sand have made it one the busiest beaches in the Dominican Republic, especially on weekends and holidays, because it is 30 km away from Santo Domingo. Boca Chica has two small islands Los Pinos, which were made with sand from the dredging of the Andrés port in the 1950s and La Matica and La Piedra, mangrove cays, submerged vascular plants and habitat for various species of birds. The beach has a natural breakwater, as well as a fresh water spring, coming from the Brujuelas underground river.\n\nThe short distance from the capital city (19 miles), the crystalline waters and the white sands turned Boca Chica into the most crowded beach of the Dominican Republic, especially on weekends and holidays. Boca Chica beach has immaculate fine sand. You can walk in the water and the depth will barely change, the water will be to your waist (or a little bit over) all the time. Boca Chica has two small islands, Los Pinos and La Matica, and two marinas. \n\nThere are several bars, restaurants, pizza stands, souvenirs stalls and loud music throughout most of the day; all this along the beach sand very close to the shore. In the evening, Boca Chica transforms itself into a town of party bars.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

His mother, Anne-Marie Perret, née Kirsberger, was a widow from Basel. Paul de Kock began life as a banker's clerk. For the most part he resided on the Boulevard St. Martin.\n\nHe began to write for the stage very early, and composed many operatic libretti. His first novel, \"L'Enfant de ma femme\" (1811), was published at his own expense. In 1820 he began his long and successful series of novels dealing with Parisian life with \"Georgette, ou la Nièce du tabellion\". He was most prolific and successful during the Restoration and the early days of Louis Philippe.\n\nHe was relatively less popular in France itself than abroad, where he was considered as the special painter of life in Paris. Dostoevsky, in his novel \"Poor Folk\" (1846), wrote that reading a novel by De Kock was not becoming for ladies<Poor Folk, Everyman's Library 1948 p. 63>. James Joyce's Ulysses includes references to Paul De Kock, including innuendos on his name in the Calypso, Sirens and Circe episodes. His novel The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays is also mentioned in the Circe episode. Major Pendennis' remark (in the novel \"Pendennis\" by the English author William Makepeace Thackeray) that he had read nothing of the novel kind for thirty years except Paul de Kock, who certainly made him laugh, is likely to remain one of the most durable of his testimonials, and may be classed with the legendary question of a foreign sovereign to a Frenchman who was paying his respects, \"Vous venez de Paris et vous devez savoir des nouvelles. Comment se porte Paul de Kock?\" The 1920 \"Encyclopedia Americana\" attributes his greater popularity abroad to his style, which it describes as his \"worst feature . . . barely presentable, a fault evidently due to deficiency of education. . . . the defects of style disappear in translation.\"\n\nThe disappearance of the grisette and of the cheap dissipation described by Henri Murger practically made Paul de Kock obsolete. But to the student of manners his portraiture of low and middle class life in the first half of the 19th century at Paris still has its value.\n\nPaul de Kock wrote about 100 volumes. With the exception of a few excursions into historical romance and some miscellaneous works of which his share in \"La Grande yule\", Paris (1842), is the chief, they are all stories of middle-class Parisian life, of guinguettes and cabarets and equivocal adventures of one sort or another. The most famous are \"André le Savoyard\" (1825) and \"Le Barbier de Paris\" (1826).\n\nThe stories are full of observation at first hand and of spicy humor. The 1905 \"New International Encyclopædia\" describes his stories as \"rather vulgar, but not immoral, demanding no literary training and gratifying no delicate taste\". They were extraordinarily popular. In 1905, Paul de Kock was seldom mentioned in the more conventional French histories of French literature. Typical examples of his work are:\n\n\nA 56-volume edition of his works came out in 1884. He has had imitators, among them his son Henri (1819–92).\n\n\n"}

The girls' soccer team was in the state tournament in 2013. The baseball team won the last ever Central Region championship in 2013, and as a result advanced to the state tournament.\n\nThe school publishes a newspaper (\"The Commentator\"), a literary magazine (\"The Educator\"), and a yearbook (\"The Historian\"). \n\nDouglas Freeman High School was mentioned in a \"Washington Post\" article referring to the school's revival of the historic \"Rebel Man\" mascot.\n\n\nJames E. Ryan's book \"Five Miles Away, A World Apart: One City, Two Schools, and the Story of Educational Opportunity in Modern America\" explores the issue of economic school segregation by comparing Freeman to nearby Thomas Jefferson High School, located in the city of Richmond. Arguing for more freedom in school choice, Ryan cites findings that \"high-poverty\" schools (like Thomas Jefferson) consistently under-perform \"low-poverty\" schools (like Freeman) academically, regardless of the financial resources allocated to them. He concludes: \"The truth is that separating the poor and politically powerless in their own schools and districts is antithetical to the idea of equal educational opportunity.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2313697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313697", "title": "Scent gland", "text": "Scent gland\n\nScent glands are exocrine glands found in most mammals. They produce semi-viscous secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. These odor-messengers indicate information such as status, territorial marking, mood, and . The odor may be subliminal—not consciously detectable. Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands may also function as scent glands in some animals.\n\nThe even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) have many specialized skin glands, the secretions of which are involved in semiochemical communication. These glands include the sudoriferous glands (located on the forehead, between the antlers and eyes), the preorbital glands (extending from the medial canthus of each eye), the nasal glands (located inside the nostrils), the interdigital glands (located between the toes), the preputial gland (located inside the foreskin of the penis), the metatarsal glands (located outside of the hind legs), the tarsal glands (located inside of the hind legs), and the inguinal glands in the lower belly or groin area.\n\nLike many other species of Artiodactyla, deer have seven major external scent glands distributed throughout their bodies. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species, and possibly even with members of other species. For example, male white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") are often seen working over a scrape. First, the animal scrapes at the dirt with its hooves, depositing the scent from his interdigital gland on the ground. After that, he may bite the tip off an overhanging branch, depositing secretions from his salivary glands onto the branch. He may then rub his face on the overhanging branch, depositing secretions from the sudoriferous and preorbital glands on it.\n\nThe tarsal gland appears to operate by a different mechanism than the other external scent glands. A behavior called \"rub-urination\" is central to this mechanism. During rub-urination, the animal squats while urinating so that urine will run down the insides of its legs and onto its tarsal glands. The tarsal glands have a tuft of hair which is specially adapted to extract certain chemical compounds from the animal's urine. For example, in the black-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus columbianus\"), the major constituent of the tarsal gland secretion is a lipid, (Z)-6-dodecen-4-olide. This compound does not originate in the tarsal gland itself, but rather it is extracted from the animal's urine by the tarsal hair tuft during the rub-urination process. In white-tailed deer, the presence and concentration of certain chemical compounds in the urine depend on the season, gender, reproductive status and social rank of the animals. This fact, along with the observation of rub-urination behavior in this animal (at least in the male) indicates that urine probably plays a role in olfactory communication in deer.\n\nCanids have several scent glands that are used in olfactory communication. The fossa has several scent glands. Like herpestids it has a perianal skin gland inside an anal sac which surrounds the anus like a pocket. The pocket opens to the exterior with a horizontal slit below the tail. Other glands are located near the penis or vagina, with the penile glands emitting a strong odor. Like the herpestids, it has no prescrotal glands.\n\n\n"}

He is the son of New York Mets' principal owner Fred Wilpon.\n\nJeff and other Wilpon family members invested with Bernard Madoff's ponzi scheme that collapsed in 2008. Unlike many who lost their investments, it was revealed in the Madoff firm's court case, \"Securities Investor Protection Corp. vs. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\" (USBC SDNY No. 08-01789), that the family partnership run by Wilpon made $48 million in their dealings with the firm.\nHe is a member of the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington DC.\n\nWilpon was born to a Jewish family, the son of Judy (née Kessler) and Fred Wilpon, the co-founder of the real estate development firm Sterling Equities and majority owner of the New York Mets. He has two siblings. His sister, Robin Wilpon, is married to Phillip Wachtler, son of former Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, Sol Wachtler. His brother, Bruce Wilpon, is a partner at Sterling Equities and was married to Yuki Oshima-Wilpon, daughter of Japanese billionaire Kenshin Ōshima. His uncle is Saul Katz. Wilpon is a graduate of Roslyn High School in Roslyn, New York. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos but instead chose to go into the family business. He served as chief officer of development and construction and oversaw the planning and development of Citifield Park. He now serves as Chief Operating Officer of the Mets and the executive vice-president of Sterling Equities.\n\nWilpon has been criticized by some for being too much of a meddler in the baseball operations for the New York Mets. In 2010, Joel Sherman of the \"New York Post\" wrote, \"Let's give Jeff Wilpon the benefit of the doubt here for a moment. Let's say he is not short-tempered. Tone deaf. A credit seeker. An accountability deflector. A micro-manager. A second-guesser. A less-than-deep thinker. And bad at self-awareness. Fine, he's none of these things. But here is the problem: This is his perception in the industry as the Mets try yet again to fix their baseball operations department.\"\n\nSherman also cited a baseball executive in regular contact with the Mets, who said, \"Jeff is the problem with the organization, and he is never going to realize that. He cannot help himself. He has to be involved. He will never hire anyone who will not let him have major input. He will not hire anyone who does not run every personnel decision through him.\" An AL executive added, \"The only person with a worse reputation than Jeff Wilpon in the game is [Marlins president] David Samson.\"\n\nIn 2009, Peter Gammons told ESPN Radio that Mets GM Omar Minaya \"isn’t the General Manager. Jeff Wilpon is. Omar's the one out there to take the heat.\"\n\nIn 2003, the team's previous partner, Nelson Doubleday, Jr., told \"The Star-Ledger\": \"Mr. Jeff Wilpon has decided that he's going to learn how to run a baseball team and take over at the end of the year… Run for the hills, boys. I think probably all those baseball people will bail... Jeff sits there by himself like he's King Tut waiting for his camel.\"\n\nMany commentators on the internet and in broadcast media have referred to Jeff Wilpon as \"Fredo\" Wilpon, after the ineffectual member of the Corleone family, Fredo Corleone, played by John Cazale in \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\".\n\nIn September 2014, Wilpon was named as a defendant in a lawsuit by Leigh Castergine, the first female senior vice president of ticket sales in the history of the Mets. According to the civil complaint filed by Castergine's attorney, Wilpon repeatedly disparaged her for having a child out of wedlock and then terminated her employment when she complained to human resources.\n\nHe is married to Valerie (née Goldman) Wilpon. Their son, Bradley Wilpon, was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 2014, and has played two summers for the Newport Gulls of the NECBL.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment announced in July 2017 that Wilpon has bought ownership in the New York Excelsior, one of the first seven teams planned for the professional eSports Overwatch League.\n"}
{"id": "2313715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313715", "title": "Celestial Toymaker", "text": "Celestial Toymaker\n\nThe Celestial Toymaker is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series, \"Doctor Who\". He was played by Michael Gough, and featured in the 1966 story \"The Celestial Toymaker\" by Brian Hayles.\n\nThe Toymaker is immortal, having already lived for millions of years. Having been cast out from an alternative universe, he obeys a different set of physical laws. The years of isolation have driven him mad, and he seeks distraction in the playing of games.\n\nIf the Toymaker loses a game, his world is destroyed (although he is powerful enough to rebuild it). If a contestant loses, he is added to the game as a toy, and if he wins, he is destroyed with the world. Either way, the contestant cannot win; the reward for both failure and success is the same: eternal existence at the Toymaker's side. The Toymaker is manipulative and can turn people, as the First Doctor comments, \"into his playthings\". As he demonstrates, he is a being of great power, judging from how he effortlessly makes the Doctor invisible and, for a while, mute.\n\nHe uses his enormous power for self-satisfaction and bullying, such as threatening to break Sergeant Rugg and Mrs Wiggs like a stack of plates.\n\nThe Toymaker appears in the novelisation of the unmade serial \"The Nightmare Fair\" by Graham Williams, in a story set in Blackpool. The Sixth Doctor and Peri defeat the Toymaker, and leave him sealed inside a forcefield maintained by his own thoughts, trapped for the remainder of his life.\n\nThe Toymaker made his first comic strip appearance in 1981, in a back-up strip titled \"The Greatest Gamble\", written by John Peel and drawn by Mike McMahon, and first published in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" #56. In the story, the Toymaker plays a game of cards against a gambler named Gaylord Lefevre on a Mississippi riverboat in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Toymaker then appeared in the \"Doctor Who Magazine\" comic strip \"End Game\", written by Alan Barnes and published in DWM #244-#247. In \"End Game\", he took the entire town of Stockbridge as his playing board to try to defeat the Eighth Doctor, using the Ultimate Weapon of a mirror which created clockwork duplicates. However, the Doctor turned this plan on its executor, creating a duplicate of the Toymaker hell-bent on playing games for ever, at which point he was cast into a dimensional void.\n\nThe Toymaker next featured in the Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Divided Loyalties\" by Gary Russell. \"Divided Loyalties\" reveals that he encountered the Doctor prior to the events of \"The Celestial Toymaker\", where he possessed the body of the Doctor's schoolfriend Rallon to use as a permanent host. This story also reveals that the Toymaker is one of the Guardians, representing dreams in the same way as the White Guardian represents order, and the Black Guardian represents chaos. The story also features Gaylord Lefevre from \"The Greatest Gamble\". At the conclusion of the story, despite the Toymaker's attempts to turn the Fifth Doctor's companions against him, he is defeated when Rallon expels the Toymaker from his body by triggering all twelve of his regenerations at once, the Toymaker subsequently being 'possessed' by Rallon's Watcher to keep him in check in future (Hence accounting for the Toymaker's different personality during his appearance in \"The Nightmare Fair\"; with Rallon's Watcher now his host rather than Rallon himself, it is as though the Toymaker himself has regenerated, changing minor but crucial aspects of his personality).\n\nThe cancelled story \"The Nightmare Fair\" was resurrected by Big Finish Productions, and released November 2009. Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant returned as the Doctor and Peri, but as Michael Gough had retired, the part of the Toymaker was played by David Bailie, who had previously played Dask in the 1977 story The Robots of Death. However, seven months before \"Fair's\" release, The Toymaker makes a surprise appearance against the Seventh Doctor in the audio story \"The Magic Mousetrap\", his power having been divided among his last group of opponents when the Doctor manipulated him into playing multiple games at once. In this story, the Toymaker is played by Paul Antony-Barber. David Bailie returns to the role in the Eighth Doctor and Charley Pollard Companion Chronicles audio story \"Solitaire\".\n"}
{"id": "2313733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313733", "title": "Dr. Zeus Inc.", "text": "Dr. Zeus Inc.\n\nDr. Zeus Inc., also known simply as The Company, is a fictional entity in a series of time travel science fiction stories by Kage Baker.\n\nAccording to the stories, Dr. Zeus operates from the 24th century, using technologies of time travel and immortality to exploit the past for commercial gain. The immortality technology is limited to taking young children and turning them into cyborgs. The time travel technology only allows journeys into the past, and returns to the present. No artifacts or people can be brought forward from their own times. In addition, the technology is expensive and dangerous for normal humans to use.\n\nHistory, or at least recorded history, cannot be changed. Dr. Zeus cannot save Lincoln, warn the \"Titanic\", prevent the sack of Rome, or stop the burning of the Library at Alexandria. It can take valuable artifacts thought to be lost in these and other events, hide them and 'rediscover' them in the future. However, even without the dangers of time travel, Dr. Zeus' employees hate the past. By their time, all stimulants and narcotics are illegal, vegetarianism is compulsory, and they are disease- and dirt-phobic. They find the past's inhabitants disgusting.\n\nTo carry out its mission, Dr. Zeus sends its employees far into human prehistory, where they take children from Neanderthal and modern human families and give them the immortality treatment. These individuals are then promised a bright future in the 24th century, in exchange for working for the Company till then. Their job is to preserve cultural artifacts, valuable plants, and endangered species, hiding them in safe places till the Company can 'recover' them in the future. The cyborgs will get to the 24th century the old-fashioned way, by living through the intervening millennia. Along the way they can create others to help them, using children who would otherwise die and not affect history. They are also provided with many recordings of future culture, entertainment, and a carefully edited view of history. Dr. Zeus alone knows everything that will happen up till the 24th century.\n\nAs the series progresses, it becomes apparent that the Dr. Zeus story is itself a fiction. How they came by their technology, and how long the Company has really existed, is an unfolding mystery. Furthermore, not even Dr. Zeus knows what happens after July 9, 2355; although it is possible to send messages to the past, there is nothing from beyond that date. This is known as the Silence, and is a source of dread to both Company people and cyborgs.\n\nThe story of the Company's origin evolves through the sequence of novels and short stories. As told in the introductions to \"In The Garden of Iden\" and \"Sky Coyote\", the Company was founded in the 24th century by scientists and businessmen who developed both the immortality process and time travel. This theory is backed up by the mortal Bugleg who, in \"Sky Coyote\", claims to have developed \"Pineal Tribrantine 3\", an artificial hormone which keeps the cyborgs youthful.\n\nTowards the end of \"Mendoza in Hollywood\", Mendoza gleans enough from historical records to realize that the Company has, operating under various names, been active on Santa Catalina Island for some time in history. Exiled to that island in the distant past, she is instructed to await the arrival of technologically advanced humanoids and inform the Company when their technology reaches a certain level. At this point, she believes, Company operatives will arrive from the future, kill all the humanoids and hide their technology to be \"discovered\" later.\n\nFurther clues appear in \"The Graveyard Game\" when Lewis, attempting to discover Mendoza's location after her disappearance, stumbles across a secret society in Victorian England called \"The Gentlemen's Speculative Society\". This is the most recent in a series of secret societies, apparently dating back to ancient Egypt, dedicated to discovering advanced technology and exploiting it for profit. The successor to the Society is a company known to be an early cover for Dr. Zeus Inc. The first incarnation of these societies, in Egypt, was started by none other than the Facilitator Joseph, Lewis's friend and partner in the search for Mendoza.\n\nAt the beginning of \"The Life of the World to Come\" it is revealed that Sir Francis Drake discovered a cache of secret documents and mysterious potions and gadgets on Santa Catalina in the 16th century. He then gave the discovery to the alchemist John Dee, a member of one of the secret societies.\n\nIn the final book, the artificial intelligence known as \"Zeus\" is created in the 24th century, in an attempt to counter the powerful AI owned by Alec Checkerfield. Since \"Zeus\" has access to all the Company's information and the time travel technology, it effectively existed before its creation. This fact is underscored by the delivery, minutes after the activation of the AI, of a communications terminal in the shape of the god Zeus, ordered a few years previously. At this point, it can be argued, the Zeus AI intervened in history to ensure its own creation in the 24th century, instructing its operatives to carry out those activities which produce the history already known to have happened.\n\nThe immortality process, taking place as it does in early childhood, results in an individual who matures into a young adult and remains that way forever. \"Facilitators\" resort to makeup and prosthetics in order to appear to be older for their roles, but others appear as they always have. The Botanist Mendoza, for instance, appears to be approximately 19 years old despite having lived for thousands of years during her life and exile in the distant past. Joseph is described as \"seeming to be about 35\" (\"The Graveyard Game\"), indicating that Facilitators may have their \"natural\" ages set higher for their roles.\n\nPreservers are the main agents of the Company, specialists in different types of artifacts. \n\nThese operatives lay the groundwork for the Preservers and keep them in line. They are masters of disguise and deceit.\n\nExecutives run secret Company facilities and implement policy. Some have become intoxicated with power and regard ordinary mortals as a disease to be wiped out.\n\nEnforcers are specially bred cyborgs, created in pre-History from Neanderthal and even stranger hominid stock. They were created as warriors to destroy the prehistoric Great Goat Cult which threatened to prevent History from happening at all.\n\n\nTrying to replace the Enforcers with a breed of mortal who will be easy to control, and not inclined to hang around forever, the Company genetically engineers a series of identical individuals under the project name \"Adonai\".\n\n\nWith centuries to think about the future, and an unknown fate awaiting them in 2355, it is not surprising that various groups of cyborgs have been conspiring to make sure they come out ahead.\n\nSince he went rogue in 1099 Budu has apparently been gathering disciples. He was disgusted by the religious wars of medieval times and wished to return humanity to a state where it could be ruled by the Enforcers, who simply kill anyone who makes war on others. This would mean drastically reducing the population. His recruits included Labienus, who with Nennius began researching plagues as a means of carrying out Budu's vision. Budu objected to this, but Labienus may have engineered his downfall and gone ahead anyway, beginning with the Spanish flu epidemic.\n\nCyborgs such as Aegeus enjoy a rich lifestyle, propped up by many mortal servants. They aim to be at the top of the pile with humanity as their slaves. They see themselves as being the real masters of the Company, with mortals such as Bugleg as mere puppets.\n\nSuleyman and his allies aim to frustrate the Plague Club, but also protect the interests of cyborgs against any attempt by the Company to get rid of them, or to place them all in storage.\n\nIn the 2350s mortals such as Bugleg, the cowardly, introverted leader of the Company expedition recounted in \"Sky Coyote\", become increasingly concerned that the cyborgs outnumber them and will take over. They attempt to find ways of disposing of the cyborgs, trying poisons etc. In the Eos (Harper Collins) edition of \"Sky Coyote\" an epilogue of sorts shows Bugleg's frantic memo to a colleague, followed by Aegeus' sarcastic comments, and Labienus' comment on Aegeus.\n\nBoth Joseph and Budu are beyond the Company's control. Joseph revives Budu, but may not like what Budu wants him to do. Meanwhile Alec is a different kind of rogue, with his own time machine.\n\n\"Homo umbratilis\", meaning \"Man of the Shadows\", is the name of a third species of human, after \"Homo neanderthalensis\" and \"Homo sapiens\". Small, pale and furtive, they hide from all contact with humans and cyborgs. They have racial memory, being born with full recollection of the knowledge of their ancestors. There are hints that they are in fact a hive species, like bees, ants and naked mole-rats, except for some hybrids from raids by humans. The hybrids are mechanical and scientific geniuses, and may be the source of the technology that the Company uses. They are not very creative, but can focus intensely on developing something, such as a disrupter field that paralyzes the cyborgs, whom they regard as enemies. Attempts to exploit these creatures, once they come to the attention of the Company, are important to the series' plot.\n\nAn example of their monomania is that, having originally disabled and captured Lewis in medieval Ireland, after he escapes with mortal help they concentrate on recapturing him until the 23rd century, even though there are other cyborgs around for them to capture and study. It is Lewis' encounter with them that lets Aegeus take advantage of their abilities.\n\nIn the final novel, \"The Sons of Heaven\", we learn more about these humans, but their origins and final fate remain obscure. A group headed by a queen female (given the title \"Quean\" in the novel) occupies tunnels in an artificial mound known as a \"Hill\". The Quean is attended by \"stupids\", the \"idiot savant\" workers who can produce technological marvels but are incapable of original thought and have limited communication skills. One of the talents of the Quean is a power of persuasion which can even be used on ordinary humans to compel them to do her bidding. Occasionally a \"homo sapiens\" male is kidnapped to become the Quean's consort. The children of this union are hybrids known in the Hill as \"Uncles\". The Quean can also mate with Uncles, to produce more \"stupids\". The Uncles, while waiting their turn for her favors, fetch her luxuries from the outside world. Eventually the Quean produces a daughter, who, if she is not killed by her mother first, will grow up to overthrow her with the help of some of the Uncles. The Uncles, like the \"stupids\", live short lives, a few decades at most. The Quean and her daughters seem to live much longer. All have inbred knowledge called Memory which tells them who they are, and what their role in the Hill is.\n\nThanks to the Company's own breeding program, mortals such as Bugleg, descended in part from captured Queans, have many of the abilities, and shortcomings, of the Homo umbratilis males.\n\nThis cultural movement is referred to frequently within the novels. The main points that can be gleaned about it are that it was a cult among humans, the main object of which was to wipe out unbelievers. Cult members covered their bodies in tattoos. Unbelievers consisted of anyone who refused to be tattooed, anyone who created any other kind of art (like Joseph's father, a cave painter), and anyone unwilling to join in the killing. The cult seems to have existed for thousands of years across Eurasia and possibly Africa. Joseph's tribe in the Basque region of Spain was wiped out by it circa 18,000 BCE, as was Labienus's village in the Middle East 5000 years later.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Company in the 24th century, the Cult was impeding the start of civilization. The Enforcers were created to destroy the Cult. Possibly because of their small numbers, a few thousand at most, this seems to have taken them thousands of years.\n\nDespite relatively low numbers, in their many thousands of years of existence the cyborgs build several elaborate facilities which serve as starting points for missions, and gathering points for new recruits. Preservers deliver their findings to these locations for storage. Incidentally, these facilities also serve as power bases for high-ranking cyborgs, known as Executive Facilitators.\n\nPossibly the oldest facility, this is remembered by some, including Joseph, as once being nothing more than a stockade. By the third century CE it is an elaborate and luxurious facility run by Aegeus, where he experiments with hybrids of humans and Homo umbratilis. It is located in the Cevennes mountains of France.\n\nIn contrast, this appears to be nothing more than a large house in the Netherlands, run for centuries by Executive Facilitator Van Drouten, serving as a collection point for Dutch art and artifacts. The house is located on the Herengracht canal in Amsterdam.\n\nLocated somewhere in the Canadian Arctic, this is Labienus' power base. In \"Sky Coyote\" the Chumash tribe were transplanted to this base where they worked for the Company doing menial jobs.\n\nThis base existed in the jungle of the Yucatan for hundreds of years before being dismantled in 1701. Its human servants were rescued sacrifices from the Mayan culture. Having been sacrificed, they believed themselves to be in Heaven, serving the gods. The head of New World One styled himself as the god Kukulcan. The last such was the fey and feckless Houbert, who seemed to prefer elaborate social events to the business of running a base.\n\nThis was an underground training base somewhere in the Australian desert, where Mendoza received her immortality treatment and education.\n\nLocated on an island in 500,000 BCE, this is a storehouse for all the genetic material used by the Company in creating its servants and Project Adonai, according to \"The Machine's Child\". Since the Company could not trust a cyborg with the store, it is overseen by a 24th-century mortal, David Reed. To protect his sanity, he has been \"cyborged\" so that he lives in a Virtual Reality world which duplicates an office in London, complete with virtual colleagues. An Artificial Intelligence looks after his needs, but the AI has developed an emotional attachment to David. The virtual office may be a projection of a real office located on a hidden floor of a building in 24th century London.\n\nThe island of Santa Catalina is the hub around which all of the mysteries of the Company revolve. Settled by strange, pale humanoids in about 150,000 BCE, it seems to be the repository of the secrets which make the Company's activities possible. In the 24th century it is the home of the Company's main database, which Alec and his AI companion The Captain raid, stealing both data and a time shuttle, setting them off on their career as time-traveling pirates sworn to destroy the Company.\n\nThe discovery of artifacts on the island by Sir Francis Drake's crew serves as the critical event that a secret society, based in England, uses to transform itself into the cabal which eventually reveals itself as Dr. Zeus, Inc. in the 24th century. Naturally the Company goes to great effort to maintain possession of the island as much as recorded history allows. Actual history records that in the 19th century much of the island was owned by a syndicate which included the Banning family and the father of General George S. Patton. In the stories the Company buys up their holdings to protect its hidden resources in the island's interior.\n\nAppearing in \"Mendoza in Hollywood\" and \"The Graveyard Game\", this is a house on Zeus Drive off Mount Olympus Drive above Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Los Angeles. The location described corresponds to a real cul-de-sac. The house is equipped with a \"time transcendence\" chamber to send people and objects through time.\n\nThe stated reason for the existence of this facility is \"monitoring the Lookout Mountain Avenue anomaly\", apparently a source of paranormal phenomena located nearby. The area has a history, real and imagined, of attracting unusual people, as well as artists, musicians etc.\n\nMentioned in passing in the stories are \"Edobase\" (old Tokyo), \"Greenland Base\", Antioch (as an underground way station in 1099 CE), \"London Station\" etc. In the novel \"In The Garden of Iden\", Joseph, Mendoza and the rest of the team ride a Company-built subway system which \"connects all parts of England\" during the Tudor period. The ride is safe but uncomfortable, the carriages being small and boxlike. The maximum speed is about that of a fast stagecoach, but without the risk of being robbed, or in the case of cyborgs pretending to be Spaniards, attacked by enraged mobs. The method of propulsion is not revealed.\n\nAll the bones in the human skeleton are replaced by \"ferroceramic steel\" in the cyborgs. Joints are replaced by \"linkages\", such as ball joints. The remaining tissues are pervaded by \"nanobots\" which use the original DNA of the human to regenerate any damaged organs. This is one of the reasons only young children can receive the treatment, since (according to the stories) DNA degrades beginning at birth.\n\nCybernetic implants in the brain give the cyborgs advanced abilities and senses, such as perfect memory, encyclopedic knowledge, instant learning, enhanced vision and hearing, multi-spectral scanning, and radio communication. Other implants tap into their senses and broadcast them to monitoring stations, so that Security Techs can always know what their charges are doing. The cyborgs can recognize, understand, and speak any known human language instantly, including local variants and dialects. Their \"lingua franca\" is called \"Cinema Standard\", presumably the English spoken in 20th century movies, with which most Company operatives are obsessed.\n\nSpecial organs release chemicals such as \"Pineal Tribrantine 3\" or PT3, which confers youth and vigor. Cyborg muscles are much stronger than the human equivalent. Their bodies are also capable of \"hyperfunction\" which allows them to carry out actions at many times normal speed.\n\nUnknown to most cyborgs, their bodies are also equipped to go into a \"fight mode\" where their hands become claws, their eyes gain protective covers, and their mouths sprout fangs. The skin drains of color in this mode, and they resemble a white demon. Normally psychological conditioning prevents them from entering a fight, but several stories, such as \"The Hotel at Harlan's Landing\" involve high-speed fights between rival cyborgs.\n\nAs is revealed in \"The Machine's Child\" the final line of defense for the Company's immortal agents is a \"time-transcendence\" field in the brain-case. With the brain \"a split-second out of phase\" with real time the brain case is, in effect, impenetrable. In addition the time field seems to be able to bend reality in order to preserve the brain, as Marco finds out when he tries to destroy some heads in a white-hot fire-pit, only to have them re-appear in the stores where he had previously kept them. This \"time field\" is probably also necessary for the cyborgs to perform their outrageous feats of speed.\n\nDescribed as a blue glow occurring around certain places and persons, this is supposedly the source of paranormal abilities in humans and cyborgs. The tendency to emit Crome's radiation can be measured, according to the novel \"Sky Coyote\", and the Company's standards forbid recruiting individuals with more than minimal Crome potential. Joseph, confronted with Mendoza's measured potential several hundred times the maximum, persuaded the technician making the measurement to fudge the number so she could be recruited, rather than send her back into the dungeons of the Inquisition to be tortured and killed.\n\nAccording to \"Mendoza in Hollywood\", materials such as quartz can accumulate Crome's radiation little by little, from the tiny amount emitted by all living things, until their entire charge is suddenly released, resulting in visions, time distortions, messages from the dead etc. It is a large body of quartz beneath the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Lookout Mountain Avenue which causes so much abnormality in that location, up to and including sending Mendoza and her companion forward in time from 1863 to 1996. This body of quartz is supposedly also tied to old Native American folk tales about the trickster god Coyote stealing the moon and burying it in Laurel Canyon.\n\nThe origin of the name is not explained in the stories.\n\nThese are endemic in time-travel stories, and usually provide the main plot twist. From the beginning of the Company stories, it is apparent even to Dr. Zeus that, in exploiting so-called recorded history, they may be responsible for history turning out the way it did, beginning with annihilating the Great Goat Cult so History as we know it could begin. As character after character turns against the Company, they are still unable to break free, their actions only making events turn to Dr. Zeus' advantage. But did the Company engineer their rebellion, or simply benefit from it? Is Dr. Zeus manipulating events, or just making sure that what is known to have happened does happen, to safeguard its own destiny? Only the things Dr. Zeus doesn't already know about can hurt it, but what does Dr. Zeus not know?\n\nThroughout the stories, the cyborgs mention \"theobromos\" as their narcotic of choice. In fact this is simply chocolate. Having been rendered immune to all known human diseases, and being largely unaffected by alcohol and other drugs, since their bodies quickly reprocess such chemicals into harmless forms, the cyborgs react to theobromos as humans might to alcohol or marijuana. The name is derived from theobromine, one of the stimulants found in the seeds of the cacao plant, although that itself takes its name from the Greek words for \"food of the gods\". Naturally the cyborgs have developed their own varieties of the plant which are especially intoxicating.\n\nOver-indulgence brings on a hangover which has to be treated with large amounts of complex carbohydrates, such as pizza or fettuccine alfredo. The humans who run the Company do not like their servants intoxicating themselves, but are powerless to prevent them from doing so.\n\nTheobromos provides a thread of humor, sometimes ironic, which runs through the stories. Examples include:\n\nDr. Zeus is named for the Greek God Zeus, who defeated his father Cronus. Cronus is sometimes confused with the entity Chronos, the personification of Time.\n\nThe \"New Inklings\" are named for a group of intellectuals in pre-WW2 England, of whom the best known are C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nThis list only includes events in known history, or myth. Future exploits by the Company are described in the books.\n"}

The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as adopted siblings who avenge the death of their mother. The film was shot in Detroit, Michigan and the Greater Toronto Area. \"Four Brothers\" was released in the United States on August 12, 2005.\n\nThe seemingly random murder of their adoptive mother, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), at a Highland Park, Michigan convenience store, brings four brothers back home to Detroit, Michigan to find out what happened. Originally under the impression the crime was a simple robbery-gone-wrong, the brothers soon discover that the robbery was merely a cover for a hit put out on Evelyn. After this revelation, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (André Benjamin) and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) track down the hired guns who killed Evelyn. Refusing to say anything, they are unceremoniously executed by Bobby and Angel.\n\nThe next day, Detroit Police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles) confront the brothers about the murders. Lieutenant Green warns them that their interference with Evelyn's case is ill-advised, and that it will eventually put them in over their heads. After confronting Jeremiah about the revelation of his failing business and benefiting from Evelyn's life insurance, the brothers are treated to a somewhat different version of events. \n\nJeremiah informs them that his construction company was failing precisely because he was not getting involved with gang lord Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and that for a project to succeed he had to pay off the right people, which he initially failed to do. In his effort to restore his business and relieve pressure from himself, he tried to pay off Sweet's henchmen. As for the life insurance, Jeremiah explains that the money went directly to him for his daughters, because he paid all of Evelyn's bills while his other brothers were not around.\n\nBack at their home, during a confrontation with Jeremiah, Sweet's men attack the brothers. Jack is shot and killed during the attack. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them. He almost spares the gunman but is offended when the gunman mumbles \"Thank God\" and kills him anyway. When Lieutenant Green arrives, he tells them not to worry about any legal ramifications, assuring them that it will go down as self-defense. \n\nHe also informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed that report on to Sweet. Green warns the brothers to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar Green confronts Fowler, hitting him and ordering Fowler to hand in his badge. They walk out of the bar, and Fowler kills Green and calls it into dispatch claiming two assailants had fired upon Green.\n\nThe remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. When Sweet accepts, Angel sets off for Fowler's. Arriving at Fowler's, he subdues him. Jeremiah then goes to meet Sweet, while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells the police that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler thinks they are coming for Angel, until Angel opens his jacket showing a wire. \n\nAngel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, and Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel. With a gun pointed to Angel's head, Fowler tells the police to back off, despite their pleadings that they are actually there to rescue Fowler. Fowler opens fire on the officers outside anyway, who return fire and kill him.\n\nMeanwhile, at frozen over Lake St. Clair, Jeremiah meets with Sweet and reveals that the $400,000 is to buy off Sweet's henchmen, who are already embittered towards him due to his blatant mistreatment of them, and kill Sweet in exchange. Sweet angrily demands to know who will be the one to kill him just as Bobby shows up. Bobby and Sweet brawl for a good five minutes, at the end, Bobby uses his hockey playing skills to get the upper hand and knocks Sweet unconscious. \n\nHis former henchmen seal his fate after he is dropped in a hole carved into the ice, drowning him. The three brothers, taken into police custody, are beaten in an attempt to make them confess to the murder of Victor Sweet, which they do not. Back home, they set about repairing their mother's house, and continuing their lives together.\n\n\nThe music for the film includes, in a repeating refrain, the song \"I Wish It Would Rain\", written by Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield, and performed by The Temptations, courtesy of Motown Records.\n\nOther music includes the following:\n\n\"Four Brothers\" was released in the United States on August 12, 2005.\n\nThis film was released on VHS and DVD as separated widescreen and full-screen versions on December 20, 2005.\n\nThe grossed $92.5 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million.\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 52% approval rating, based on 134 reviews with an average score of 5.7/10. The consensus is: \"Despite striking a believable rapport among its principal actors, \"Four Brothers\" overwhelms with ultra-violent, vigilante-glorifying action and devolves into too many fractured, insubstantial thematic directions.\"\n\nAn article written in 2010 suggested that Paramount Pictures was developing a sequel for the film, with Mark Wahlberg returning to reprise his role. It would be written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett.\n\n\nBig B a Malayalam language movie was a unofficial remake of this movie directed by Amal Neerad\n\n"}

It lasted 33 innings, with 8 hours and 25 minutes of playing time. 32 innings were played April 18/19, 1981, at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and the final 33rd inning was played June 23, 1981. Pawtucket won the game, 3–2.\n\nThe game began on Saturday, April 18, 1981 at 8:25 p.m., after a delay of about 30 minutes due to problems with stadium lights, with 1,740 in attendance. It continued through the night and into Easter morning. Although most leagues have a curfew rule that would have suspended the game—the International League's activates at 12:50 a.m.—the rule book of home plate umpire Dennis Cregg did not contain one. After Pawtucket's Russ Laribee's sacrifice fly drove in Chico Walker in the bottom of the ninth inning and tied the game at one run each, the teams continued playing.\n\nSeveral times, one side neared victory before circumstances changed. When Wade Boggs drove in the tying run in the bottom of the 21st inning after a Rochester run, even the Pawtucket players groaned. He recalled, \"I didn't know if the guys on the team wanted to hug me or slug me.\" The weather was so cold that players burned broken bats and the stadium's wooden benches to warm themselves, and the clubhouses ran out of food. The wind blew into the infield, making hits difficult; Pawtucket's Dave Koza later said that otherwise his team would have won in nine innings, with \"four or five shots that would have been out of the park\". For example, Sam Bowen hit a fly ball to center that reportedly left the field before the wind blew it back to Rochester outfielder Dallas Williams. Williams went 0–for–13 in 15 plate appearances, one of many records achieved during the game.\n\nAfter Pawtucket's Luis Aponte pitched the seventh to tenth innings in relief, manager Joe Morgan—who himself would be ejected in the 22nd inning by Cregg—let him leave before the game ended. Aponte's wife did not believe his explanation for coming home at 3 a.m. Sunday. He promised that the Sunday newspaper would prove his story, but since the game's postponement occurred too late to appear in it, Aponte had to wait until the Monday edition. Cregg had brought his nephew David to the game; David's father became concerned for his family and called the police, who told him that the game had not ended.\n\nBy 4 a.m. the players were \"delirious\" from exhaustion; Rochester's Dave Huppert had caught the first 31 innings before being replaced, and Jim Umbarger pitched 10 scoreless innings from the 23rd inning, striking out nine and giving up four hits. The president of the league, Harold Cooper, was finally reached on the phone by Pawtucket publicity manager Mike Tamburro sometime after 3:00 a.m.; the horrified Cooper ordered that play stop at the end of the current inning. Finally at 4:07 a.m., at the end of the 32nd inning and more than eight hours after it began, the game was stopped. There were 19 fans left in the seats—not including David Cregg, who had fallen asleep—all of whom received season or lifetime passes to McCoy Stadium. As the players went home to rest before returning at 11 a.m. for an afternoon game that Sunday, they saw people going to Easter sunrise service. When Boggs' father complimented him for getting four hits in the game, the player admitted that he had had 12 at bats.\n\nBoth teams signed a baseball on Sunday for display at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Cooper had suggested that the game resume that day, but Rochester manager Doc Edwards requested a delay because of the risk of injury. Instead, it resumed on the evening of Tuesday, June 23, the next time the Red Wings were in town. A sellout crowd of 5,746 and 140 reporters from around the world were present, partly because the major leagues were on strike at the time; the players voted against an offer to resume the game at Fenway Park to avoid crossing the picket line. On that evening, it took just one inning and 18 minutes to finish the game, with Koza driving in the winning run in the bottom of the 33rd. The losing pitcher was Steve Grilli, who had joined Rochester in the interim since the game's suspension.\n\nThe Pawtucket Red Sox celebrated the 25th anniversary of the game on June 23, 2006. \nMany members of both teams attended a luncheon and round table discussion in Providence, Rhode Island, and a ceremony was held before the game against the Columbus Clippers that night. Dennis Cregg thinks that David Cregg has never attended another baseball game.\n\nSources:\n\nMcCoy Stadium, Pawtucket, Rhode Island\n\n\nTwo future Hall of Famers were part of the historic game. Cal Ripken, Jr., who was inducted in 2007, went 2–for–13 on the night playing third base for Rochester. Ripken was the American League's Rookie of the Year the following year.

{"id": "2313775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313775", "title": "Principle of restricted choice", "text": "Principle of restricted choice\n\nIn contract bridge, the principle of restricted choice states that play of a particular card decreases the probability its player holds any equivalent card. For example, South leads a low spade, West plays a low one, North plays the queen, East wins with the king. The ace and king are equivalent cards; East's play of the king decreases the probability East holds the ace – and increases the probability West holds the ace. The principle helps other players infer the locations of unobserved equivalent cards such as that spade ace after observing the king. The increase or decrease in probability is an example of Bayesian updating as evidence accumulates and particular applications of restricted choice are similar to the Monty Hall problem.\n\nJeff Rubens (1964, 457) stated the principle thus: \"The play of a card which may have been selected as a choice of equal plays increases the chance that the player started with a holding in which his choice was restricted.\" Crucially, it helps play \"in situations which used to be thought of as guesswork.\" In many of those situations the rule derived from the principle is to \"play for split honors\". After observing one equivalent card, that is, one should continue play as if two equivalents were split between the opposing players, so that there was no choice about which one to play. Whoever played the first one doesn't have the other one.\n\nWhen the number of equivalent cards is greater than two, the principle is complicated because their equivalence may not be manifest. When one partner holds ♣Q and ♣10, say, and the other holds ♣J, it is usually true that those three cards are equivalent but the one who holds two of them does not know it. Restricted choice is always introduced in terms of two touching cards – consecutive ranks in the same suit, such as ♥QJ or ♦KQ – where equivalence is manifest.\n\nIf there is no reason to prefer a specific card (for example to signal to partner), a player holding two or more equivalent cards should sometimes randomize their order of play (see the note on Nash equilibrium). The probability calculations in coverage of restricted choice often take uniform randomization for granted but that is problematic.\n\nThe principle of restricted choice even applies to an opponent's choice of an opening lead from equivalent suits. See Kelsey & Glauert (1980).\n\nConsider the suit combination represented in the figure. There are four spade cards 8754 in the South (closed hand) and five AJ1096 in the North (dummy, visible to all players). West and East hold the remaining four spades KQ32 in their two closed hands.\n\nAfter West follows to the second spade, which is the moment of decision referred to above, only two of 16 original lies remain possible (bold), for West has played both low cards and East the king. At first glance, it may seem that the odds are now even, 1:1, so that South should expect to do equally well with either of the two possible continuations.\n\nHowever, this is not the case because if East had KQ, he could equally well have played the queen instead of the king. Thus some deals with original lie 32 and KQ would not reach this stage; they would instead reach the parallel stage with K alone missing, South having observed 32 and Q. In contrast, every deal with original lie Q32 and K would reach this stage, for East played the king perforce (without choice, or by \"restricted choice\").\n\nIf East would win the first trick with the king or queen \"uniformly at random\" from KQ, then that original lie 32 and KQ would reach this stage half the time and would take the other fork in the road half the time. Thus on the actual sequence of play, the odds are not even but one-half to one, or 1:2. East would retain queen from original KQ about one-third of the time and retain no spades from original K about two-thirds of the time.\n\nImportantly, this assumes that the defenders have no signalling system, so that the play by west of (say) the 3 followed by the 2 does not signal a doubleton. During the course of many equivalent deals, East with KQ should in theory win the first trick with the king or queen uniformly at random; that is, half each without any pattern.\n\nThis is an attempt at a more accurate calculation of the odds as explained in the previous section.\n\n\"A priori\", four outstanding cards \"split\" as shown in the first two columns of the table. For example, three cards are together and the fourth is alone, a \"3-1 split\" with probability 49.74%. To understand the \"number of specific lies\" refer to the preceding list of all lies.\n\nThus the table shows that the \"a priori\" odds on these two specific lies were not even but slightly in favor of the former, about 6.78 to 6.22 for KQ against K.\n\nWhat are the odds \"a posteriori\", at the moment of truth in our example play of the spade suit? If East does with KQ win the first trick uniformly at random with the king or the queen – and with K win the first trick with the king, having no choice – the posterior odds are 3.39 to 6.22, a little more than 1:2, in percentage terms a little more than 35% for KQ. To play the ace A from North on the second round should win about 35% while to finesse again with the ten 10 wins about 65%.\n\nThe principle of restricted choice is general but this specific probability calculation does suppose East would win with the king from KQ precisely half the time (which is best). If East would win with the king from KQ more or less than half the time, then South wins more or less than 35% by playing the ace. Indeed, if East would win with the king 92% of the time (=6.22/6.78), then South wins 50% by playing the ace and 50% by repeating the finesse. If that is true, however, South wins almost 100% by repeating the finesse after East wins with the queen – for the queen from \"that East\" player almost denies the king.\n\nA more complete treatment would consider all of the choices, not only the choices of high card from two equals. In the example spades suit, we must incorporate the choice of low card by West from 32 and from Q32. The 2 and 3 are manifestly equivalent cards which West should play uniform randomly from both original holdings – that is, randomly on the first two tricks, always retaining the queen from Q32. The preceding probability calculation depends on West doing so.\n\nThe principle of restricted choice is an application of Bayes' theorem. \nKp - King played by East in the first trick. KQ - East has KQ, K - East has K.\n\nformula_1\n\nThe first 2 equations are Bayes' theorem, the rest is simple algebra. Note that P(Kp | KQ) is 0.5 because we assumed that East plays the king or queen with equal probability, when he has choice.\n\nIncreases and decreases in the probabilities of original lies of the opposing cards, as the play of the hand proceeds, are examples of Bayesian updating as evidence accumulates.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2313779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313779", "title": "Labor unions in Japan", "text": "Labor unions in Japan\n\nLabour unions emerged in Japan in the second half of the Meiji period, after 1890, as the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization. Until 1945, however, the labour movement remained weak, impeded by a lack of legal rights, anti-union legislation, management-organized factory councils, and political divisions between “cooperative” and radical unionists. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the US Occupation authorities initially encouraged the formation of independent unions. The legislation was passed that enshrined the right to organize, and membership rapidly rose to 5 million by February 1947. The organization rate peaked at 55.8% in 1949 and subsequently declined to 18.5% as of 2010.\n\nThe labour movement went through a process of reorganization from 1987 to 1991 from which emerged the present configuration of three major labour union federations, along with other smaller national union organizations.\n\nIn 2005, 43,096 labour unions in Japan, with a combined membership of 7,395,666 workers, belonged either directly, or indirectly through labour union councils, to the three main labour union federations:\n\n\nA further 19,139 unions, with a combined membership of 2,842,521 workers, were affiliated to other national labour organizations. The labour union organizations included (with membership figures for 2001/2002) the National Federation of Construction Workers' Unions (717,908) Federation of City Bank Employees' Unions (105,950), Zendenko Roren (53,853), National Federation of Agricultural Mutual Aid Societies Employees' Unions (45,830), All Japan Council of Optical Industry Workers' Union (44,776), National Teachers Federation of Japan (42,000), Faculty and Staff Union of Japanese Universities (38,500), and All Aluminium Industrial Workers Union (36,000).\n\nIn the first half of the Meiji period (1868-1912), most labour disputes occurred in the mining and textile industries and took the form of small-scale strikes and spontaneous riots. The second half of the period witnessed rapid industrialization, the development of a capitalist economy, and the transformation of many feudal workers to wage labour. The use of strike action increased, and 1897, with the establishment of a union for metalworkers, saw the beginnings of the modern Japanese trade-union movement.\n\nIn February 1898, engineers and stokers at the Japan Railway Company successfully struck for improvement of status and higher wages. In the same year, ships' carpenters in Tokyo and Yokohama formed a union, and a dispute followed with demands for higher wages.\n\n1907 saw the greatest number of disputes in a decade, with large-scale riots at Japan's two leading copper mines, Ashio and Besshi, which were only suppressed by the use of troops. None of these early unions were large (the metalworkers union had 3,000 members, only 5% of workers employed in the industry), or lasted longer than three or four years, largely due to strong opposition from employers and the government's anti-union policies, notably the Public Order and Police Provisions Law (1900).\n\nWith the influence of western coalitions and their mission to implement work insurance in Britain, a multitude of Japanese citizens ignited countless riots, labor revolts, and unionization in order to counter the insufferable conditions. At the beginning of the 20 century, Bunji Suzuki, founder of the inspirational, self-help group, established a 13-member organization, but soon it rose into a powerful resisting unionization incorporating numerous artisans and factory workers. \n\nOne labour organization that did survive was the Friendly Society (\"Yuaikai\"), formed in 1912 by Bunji Suzuki, which became Japan's first durable union and was renamed the Japan Federation of Labour (\"Nihon Rōdō Sodomei\" or \"Sōdōmei\") in 1921. Two years later it had a membership of 100,000 in 300 unions. From 1918 to 1921, a wave of major industrial disputes marked the peak of organized labour power. A prolonged economic slump that followed brought cutbacks in employment in heavy industry. In the early 1920s, ultra-cooperative unionists proposed the fusion of labour and management interests, heightening political divisions within the labour movement and precipitating the departure of left wing unions from Sōdōmei in 1925. The union movement has remained divided between right wing (“cooperative”) unions and left wing unions ever since.\n\nAfter the First World War, there were many attempts to establish a trade union law to protect the rights of workers to organize themselves, including a Department of Home Affairs bill in 1925, which would have prevented employers from discharging workers for belonging to a union, or requiring workers to quit (or not join) a union. But these bills never became law.\n\nHampered by their weak legal status, the absence of a right to bargain collectively with employers, and the setting up of management-organized factory councils, over 800 unions had succeeded in organizing only 7.9% of the labour force by 1931. Of these unions, the majority were organized along industrial or craft lines, with about one-third organized on an enterprise basis.\n\nIn 1940, the government dissolved the existing unions and absorbed them into the Industrial Association for Serving the Nation (\"Sangyo Hokokukai\" or \"Sampō\"), the government-sponsored workers' organization, as part of a national reorganization of all civil organizations under central government direction and as a means of controlling radical elements in the workforce. Sampō remained in existence at the end of the war.\n\nAs the Second World War was nearing its end, on 26 July 1945, Allied leaders Winston Churchill, Harry S Truman, and Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded Japan's unconditional surrender. This declaration also defined the major goals of the post surrender Allied occupation: \"The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights, shall be established\" (Section 10). \n\nIn addition, the document stated: \"The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government\" (Section 12). The Allies sought not merely punishment or reparations from a militaristic foe, but fundamental changes in the nature of its political system. In the words of political scientist Robert E. Ward: \"The occupation was perhaps the single most exhaustively planned operation of massive and externally directed political change in world history.\"\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, allied forces, mostly American, rapidly began arriving in Japan. Almost immediately, the occupiers began an intensive program of legal changes designed to democratize Japan. One action was to ensure the creation of a Trade Union law to allow for the first time workers to organize, strike, and bargain collectively, which was passed by the Diet of Japan on 22 December 1945.\n\nWhile the law was created while Japan was under occupation, the law itself was largely a Japanese work. It was put together by a large legal advisory commission headed by the legal scholar Suehiro Izutaro. The commission was quite large, consisting of \"three Welfare ministry bureaucrats and two scholars, a steering committee of 30 members (including the communist firebrand Kyuichi Tokuda), and an overall membership of more than 130 members representing universities, corporations, political parties, the bureaucracy, social workers, and labor.\"\n\nIn addition to the Trade Union Act of 1945, the postwar constitution of Japan, which became law on 3 May 1947 includes article 28, which guarantees the right of workers to participate in a trade union.\n\nOn 1 June 1949, a new version of the Trade Union Law was enacted. It has since been amended in 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1959, 1962, 1966, 1971, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2005.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, Japan's 74,500 trade unions were represented by four main labor federations: the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (日本労働組合総評議会 \"nihon rōdō kumiai sōhyōgikai\", commonly known as Sohyo), with 4.4 million members—a substantial percentage representing public sector employees; the Japan Confederation of Labour (\"zen nihon rodo sodomei\", commonly known as Domei), with 2.2 million members; the Federation of Independent Labour Unions ( Churitsu Roren), with 1.6 million members; and the National Federation of Industrial Organizations ( Shinsanbetsu), with only 61,000 members.\n\nIn 1987 Domei and Churitsu Roren were dissolved and amalgamated into the newly established National Federation of Private Sector Unions ( RENGO), and in 1990 Sohyo affiliates merged with Rengo.\n\nThe rate of labor union membership declined considerably after its postwar high to 18.5% as of 2010. The continuing long-term reduction in union membership was caused by several factors, including the restructuring of Japanese industry away from heavy industries. Many people entering the workforce in the 1980s joined smaller companies in the tertiary sector, where there was a general disinclination toward joining labor organizations.\n\nAny regular employee below the rank of section chief is eligible to become a union officer. Management, however, often pressures the workers to select favored employees. Officers usually maintain their seniority and tenure while working exclusively on union activities and while being paid from the union's accounts, and union offices are often located at the factory site. Many union officers go on to higher positions within the corporation if they are particularly effective, but few become active in organized labor activities at the national level.\n\nThe relationship between the typical labor union and the company is unusually close. Both white- and blue-collar workers join the union automatically in most major companies. Temporary and subcontracting workers are excluded, and managers with the rank of section manager and above are considered part of management. In most corporations, however, many of the managerial staff are former union members. In general, Japanese unions are sensitive to the economic health of the company, and company management usually briefs the union membership on the state of corporate affairs.\n\nLocal labor unions and work unit unions, rather than the federations, conducted the major collective bargaining. Unit unions often banded together for wage negotiations, but federations did not control their policies or actions. Federations also engaged in political and public relations activities.\n\nDuring prosperous times, the spring labor offensives are highly ritualized affairs, with banners, sloganeering, and dances aimed more at being a show of force than a crippling job action. Meanwhile, serious discussions take place between the union officers and corporate managers to determine pay and benefit adjustments.\n\nDuring downturns, or when management tries to reduce the number of permanent employees, strikes often occur. The number of working days lost to labor disputes peaked in the economic turmoil of 1974 and 1975 at around 9 million workdays in the two-year period. In 1979, however, there were fewer than 1 million days lost. Since 1981 the average number of days lost per worker each year to disputes was just over 9% of the number lost in the United States. \n\nAfter 1975, when the economy entered a period of slower growth, annual wage increases moderated and labor relations were conciliatory. During the 1980s, workers received pay hikes that on average closely reflected the real growth of GNP for the preceding year. In 1989, for example, workers received an average 5.1% pay hike, while GNP growth had averaged 5% between 1987 and 1989. The moderate trend continued in the early 1990s as the country's national labor federations were reorganizing themselves.\n\n\nWorkers:\n\n\n----\n"}

It is used as a derogatory word, but also as a normal colloquial term and self-denomination.\n\nOriginally common as \"Kanakermann\" among 19th century mariners to refer to comrades from the South Pacific (and later all of Southeast Asia), and carrying a connotation of praise for their seafaring abilities (see Polynesian navigation), it was transferred with more ambiguous connotations to Southern European immigrants in the 1960s, and is now usually used with an exclusively derogatory connotation against people with roots in the \"Orient\" \"(German term for the area which includes North Africa, Middle East and Afghanistan)\". \n\nThe word is originally derived from the Hawaiian word for human, \"kanaka\". Until 2009, several rough translations of the word \"Kanak\" were admitted: \"man\", \"animal man\", and \"wild man\" being the most used. In its resolution n°5195, the Academy of the Polynesian languages Pa ' umotu specified a definition more faithful to the primal Polynesian language \"Mamaka Kaïo\" of origin, that of \"free man\".\n\nAs is the case with the terms nigger or queer in English, Kanake has been re-appropriated by people of Turkish, Kurdish, Arab, etc. descent and used proudly as a term of self-identification. In that context, Kanak Sprak is a term used for the German dialect and manner of speech used especially among those group of persons.\n\nDespite this, the word is often used in common language and also in Hip-Hop, films (e.g. \"\"), etc. as a modified synonym to Nigga. Similar to the use of \"Nigga\" in the United States, this is often done to emphasize a flamboyant manner, violent tendencies, an affinity to crime and a status as an outcast from society, both used as a derogatory term and especially by young people who grew up in Germany and originate from predominantly Muslim countries . \n\nSome claim that the vernacular use of the word may be on the decline. In an interview on 26 February 2006 with the German weekly \"Die Welt\", German-Turkish author Feridun Zaimoğlu was asked if the word \"Kanake\" still appeared in contemporary language. Zaimoğlu answered, \"That is over. Also pleasant!\" In his first book \"Kanak Sprak\" 1995, Zaimoğlu attempts to express the authentic, tough, and subversive power of slang language spoken by young Turkish male youth in Germany and calls for a new self-confidence.\n\n"}

It had a population of 14,316 in the 2015 census. The town is served by Guerrero Negro Airport.\n\nThe town has a celebration each year to hail the annual arrival of the gray whales that calve in the lagoons of Baja California Sur (BCS). This festival occurs during the first half of February. The port of San Blas, also in BCS, has a similar festival on February 24 and 25.\n\nGuerrero Negro was founded in 1957 when Daniel Ludwig built a salt works there to supply the demand of salt in the western United States. The salt mine was established around the Ojo de Liebre coastal lagoon to take advantage of its strong salinity. This company, called Exportadora de Sal, S.A., of C.V. (\"Salt Exporters, Inc.\"), eventually became the greatest salt mine in the world, with a production of seven million tons of salt per year, exported to the main centers of consumption in the Pacific basin, especially Japan, Korea, the United States, Canada, Taiwan and New Zealand. \n\nLudwig also constructed the hotel Acapulco Princess in the port of Acapulco, Guerrero. In 1973, he sold the salt company to the Mexican government and the corporation Mitsubishi, 51% and 49% respectively. The company is distinguished not only by its growth and its yield, but also by the progress which has reached more than a thousand employees, their community and its ecological surroundings: The salt works, located in a site of extraordinary beauty, within a biosphere reserve, has been pivotal in the development of the region. Its economic success has contributed to environmental conservation, where each winter whales gather, many species of resident and migratory birds stay, visiting birds originating mainly in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe town was named Guerrero Negro when founded in 1957 after the \"Black Warrior\", a U.S. American whaling ship from Duxbury, Massachusetts (near Boston). That ship, captained by Robert Brown, wrecked in what was then called Frenchman's Lagoon on December 20, 1858. The bay was later renamed after the ship. Contrary to a few sources, it was not named after the leader of the rebellion and early president of independent Mexico, Vicente Guerrero, the national hero who was of Mestizo and African ancestry, and sometimes called \"El Guerrero Negro.\" There is a town named Vicente Guerrero over 400 km north in Baja.\n\nIt was during this era that Captain Charles Melville Scammon discovered a prolific gray whale breeding lagoon; it became a choice hunting ground for American and European whalers. Although locally known as \"\"Laguna Ojo de Liebre\"\" (\"eye of the jackrabbit\"), this lagoon became known to English-speaking whale watchers and boaters from around the world as \"Scammon's Lagoon.\" Since the 20th century, a whale-watching industry has developed around the whales in the lagoon. Due to familiarity with humans, the whales that come to this lagoon are particularly known for their willingness to approach the whale-watching boats; sometimes the whales (especially the newborns) allow themselves to be petted by observers.\n\nThe town is on Federal Highway 1.\n\n\n\n"}

There are many different types and communities, including Engineering Duty Officers, Aerospace Engineering Duty Officers, Aerospace Maintenance Duty Officers, Naval Intelligence Officers, Cryptologic Warfare Officers, Information Operations Officers, Foreign Area Officers, Public Affairs Officers, Naval Oceanographers, Information Professionals, and Human Resources.\n\nEDOs apply technical expertise, practical engineering judgment, and business acumen to the research, development, design, acquisition, construction, life cycle maintenance, modernization, and disposal of ships and submarines and their associated warfare support systems. EDOs work in Fleet Maintenance & Industrial Management (50%), Acquisition (20%), and Systems Engineering (30%).\n\nAEDOs provide professional management and technical direction in the entire air weapon system acquisition process from design to production and later product improvements of Naval aircraft, spacecraft, and weapons. Over one-third of AEDO billets are flying billets. AEDOs test and evaluate new aircraft, weapons systems, and weapons in various stages of development. Throughout a career, the AEDO will have billets primarily in NAVAIR in: (1) operational support activities; (2) headquarters; (3) research, development, test, and evaluation; and (4) manufacturing and production. All active duty AEDOs and most Navy Reserve AEDOs are accessed from the Unrestricted Line and have previously qualified and been designated as Naval Aviators or Naval Flight Officers.\n\nAMDOs provide full-time direction in the development, establishment, and implementation of maintenance and material management policies and procedures for the support of naval aircraft, airborne weapons, attendant systems and related support equipment. The community includes approximately 500 officers. In addition to working in fleet maintenance organizations throughout the fleet, AMDOs are very much involved in all aspects of material acquisition and support as top-level Program Managers in NAVAIR and as Commanding Officers of the Naval Aviation Depots. AMDOs and AEDOs are combined into a new, single competitive category at the Captain level.\n\nNaval Intelligence provides tactical, operational and strategic intelligence support to U.S. naval forces, joint services, multi-national forces, and executive level decision-makers. Naval Intelligence Officers have a wide variety of technical and non-technical academic backgrounds, including political science, modern history, physical and natural sciences, and the liberal arts (which include languages and linguistics). There are approximately 1,350 Naval Intelligence Officers.\n\nFormerly known as Naval Information Warfare Officers, there are over 800 Navy Cryptologic Warfare officers, who perform Naval Information Operations functions as directed by the Chief of Naval Operations afloat and ashore, and National Signals Intelligence tasks assigned by the Director, National Security Agency at NSA facilities ashore. These functions include:\n-Information Operations (IO, composed of Electronic Warfare-EW, Operational Security-OPSEC, Military Deception-MILDEC, Computer Network Operations-CNO, and Psychological Operations-PSYOP) support on board ships, submarines and aircraft and ashore\n-Signals Intelligence/EW tasks assigned under CNO authority (generally afloat) and DIRNSA (ashore)\n-Information Operations to maximize friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum and to minimize adversary IO efforts\n\nThe Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) Community is a stand-alone Restricted Line Community offering world-wide assignment opportunities to qualified Naval Officers.\n\nNaval Officers selected for FAO are assigned a region of specialization, provided language and graduate education on an as-required basis, and detailed to FAO-coded billets in accordance with the Navy FAO career path.\n\nNavy FAOs maintain a broad range of military skills and experiences: knowledge of political-military affairs; familiarity with the political, cultural, social, economic, and geographic factors of the countries and regions in which they are stationed; and proficiency in one or more of the dominant languages in their regions of expertise.\n\nNavy FAOs can expect to serve on staffs of Fleets, Combatant Commands, Defense Agencies, and DoD military-diplomatic offices at U.S. Embassies. They provide expertise in planning and executing operations, provide liaison with foreign militaries operating in coalitions with U.S. forces, conduct political-military activities, and execute military-diplomatic missions.\n\nThe Public Affairs community is responsible for \"Telling the Navy Story.\" Navy Public Affairs comprises three functional areas:\n\nPAOs work with media outlets to communicate with the American public.\n\nPAOs produce publications, briefings and video news programs to communicate with Sailors, their families, reservists, retirees and civilian employees.\n\nPAOs reach out to the American public through \"hands-on\" programs like public tours, Congressional and VIP visits and embarks, speaking engagements, open houses and special events.\n\nPAOs serve at sea, ashore, and in joint assignments, and are always deployed where Navy news is being made. All active duty PAOs join the community through lateral transfer from the Unrestricted Line while the Navy Reserve has a limited number of direct annual accessions into the PAO designator through a Direct Commission Officer (DCO) program. Today there are about 240 officers in this community, the smallest in the Restricted Line.\n\nThe Naval Oceanography community collects, analyzes, and then distributes data about the ocean and the atmosphere to Navy forces operating all over the world. Naval oceanographers are first on the scene - either literally in survey ships, or figuratively through computer prediction programs - in any military operation. There are approximately 430 Oceanography officers. They assist the war fighter in taking tactical advantage of the environment. They support the operational fleet from a variety of platforms. This can range from local area weather forecasting in support of aircraft carrier operations to optimizing the use of a sonar system in accordance with prevailing underwater sound conditions.\n\nThe Information Professional Community is responsible for offensive and defensive Navy information operations to support requirements of theatre and operational commanders and national policy makers. They provide expertise in information, command and control, and space systems through the planning, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and security of systems that support Navy operational and business processes. Presently, there are billets for 535 officers.\n\nThe Human Resources community plans, programs, and executes life-cycle management of the navy's most important resource – its people. The primary focus will be on the human resources system: the combined elements of manpower, personnel, training, and recruiting. There are billets for 570 officers in this community, under the direction of the Chief of Naval Personnel.\n\n"}

The Khumalos are part of a group of Zulus and Ngunis known as the Mntungwa. Others include the Blose and Mabaso, located between the Ndwandwe and the Mthethwa. Their most famous issue was Mzilikazi, an influential figure in the mfecane, and founder of the Northern Ndebele nation.\n\nUntil the rise of Zwide and the Ndwandwes, life was a simple affair and the Khumalos located at Mkhuze had the best that the land which would become Zululand had to offer: plenty of water, fertile soil and grazing ground. But the Khumalos in the early nineteenth century would have to lose their neutrality and choose a side, and this they postponed for as long as they could. To please the Ndwandwe, Mashobana – a Khumalo chief – married the daughter of the Ndwandwe chief Zwide and sired a son, Mzilikazi. The Ndwandwes are amaNguni aseMbo, though all spoke a very similar language (all Nguni languages are similar).\n\nWhen Mashobane did not tell Zwide about patrolling Mthethwa amabutho (soldiers), Zwide had Mashobana killed, and the leadership of the Khumalo fell to Mzilikazi. Mzilikazi immediately did not trust his grandfather, Zwide, and took fifty warriors to join Shaka. Shaka was overjoyed because the Khumalos would be useful spies on Zwide and the Ndwandwes. After a few battles, Shaka gave Mzilikazi the extraordinary honour of being chief of the Khumalos and to remain semi-independent from the Zulu, if Zwide could be defeated.\n\nThis caused immense jealousy amongst those who had been with Shaka for many years, but as warriors none such as Shaka had realised their equal in Mzilikazi. All intelligence for the defeat of Zwide was collected by Mzilikazi. Hence, when Zwide was defeated Shaka rightly acknowledged he could not have done it without Mzilikazi and presented him with an ivory axe. There were only two such axes – one for Shaka and one for Mzilikazi. Shaka himself placed the plumes on Mzilikazi's head after Zwide was vanquished.\n\nThe Khumalos returned to peace in their ancestral homeland. This peace lasted until Shaka asked Mzilikazi to test a tribe to the north of the Khumalo, belonging to one Raninsi a Sotho. After the defeat of Raninsi, Mzilikazi refused to hand over the cattle to Shaka. Shaka, loving Mzilikazi, did nothing about it. His generals however, long disliking Mzilikazi, pressed for action, and thus a first force was sent to teach Mzilikazi a lesson. The force was soundly beaten by Mzilikazi's 500 warriors, compared to the Zulus' 3,000 warriors (though Mzilikazi had the cover of the mountains). This made Mzilikazi the only warrior to have ever defeated Shaka in battle. Mzilikazi was the soul King of the Ndebele the ultimate power and giver of power in the kingdom\n\nShaka did not seem to mind, but he reluctantly sent his veteran division, the Ufasimbi, to rid themselves of Mzilikazi and the embarrassing situation. Mzilikazi, left with only three hundred warriors who were grossly out-numbered, and betrayed by his brother, Zeni, who had wanted Mzilikazi's position for himself, was defeated.\n\nFrom there the Khumalos would be scattered across southern Africa, some becoming the Sotho, and some joining other groups such as the Tswana, but the vast majority remained Zulu and Mthwakazi. \"Mthwakazi\" is what the Ndebeles call themselves. \"Matabele\" is a name originating from white settlers, itself coming from \"Tebele\", a name given to all Zulus by the Sotho at that time. The Ndebeles are Mthwakazi, drawing strength and wisdom from King Mzilikazi.\n\n\n"}

Years of debate to restore a direct route followed. In 1963, Arthur Laing, Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources, announced plans for a toll bridge to be completed within three years. By 1965, he was promoting a tunnel. In 1971, Don Jamieson, Minister of Transport announced a toll-free bridge, but the proposed ramps directly accessing bridges to Lulu Island would not be built. Richmond residents were angry.\n\nOn September 6, 1974, Pierre Trudeau announced that the new bridge over the north arm of the Fraser River would be named after Arthur Laing, who was a member of House of Commons of Canada from Vancouver.\n\nAlthough the bridge opened to traffic in August 1975, Otto Lang, Minister of Transport, performed the official opening of the $23m crossing in May 1976. On hand were Premier Bill Bennett, Gil Blair, mayor of Richmond, Art Phillips, mayor of Vancouver, and widow Geraldine Laing, who unveiled a plaque. \n\nConnecting Grant McConachie Way with SW Marine Drive, the bridge is long and wide, with a main span standing above the river. The main span comprises haunched (deeper at supports) steel box-girders and the approaches are concrete box-girders. YVR owns and maintains this high-level four-lane crossing, that has no sidewalks, and cyclists ride on the shoulders of the roadway. Being federal property, signage is in both official languages.\n\nClaiming concerns over increased congestion on Granville St., the City of Vancouver opposed access ramps for Richmond traffic. However, since these commuters were already using the bridge by turning at Aviation Ave., the true impact of ramps would be to reduce travel distance by , and improve traffic flow on Sea Island. Tom Siddon, member for Burnaby—Richmond—Delta, pressed for the ramps, which opened in 1986.\n\nIn 2006, YVR floated a proposal that the bridge be restricted to airport traffic, which provoked a hostile reaction from Richmond city councillors.\n\nIn 1987, about 45 percent of the deck was milled to about to remove salt-contaminated concrete. After patching, the surface received cathodic protection, before placing a thick low-slump dense concrete overlay. The exercise closed half the lanes for four months, and cost about $3m.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the bridge underwent seismic upgrades, which comprised deficient bearings, piers and foundations, and potential soil liquefaction. The work included 800 stone columns installed along either side of the bridge for ground improvement. Richmond, about metre above sea level, requires drainage and flood protection. To this end, Grauer Road was raised to 4.7m, which would handle a one-metre rise in sea level. At the road perimeter, the installation of a buried steel sheet pile wall will ensure the bridge piers remain flexible in a seismic event. The road base comprises pumice for light weight and drainage. The project was completed in 2014 for the opening of the McArthurGlen outlet mall.\n\nIn 2008, Translink added a bus lane on Russ Baker Way, between Gilbert Road and Cessna Drive. To respond to 127 crashes each year on the bridge, camera monitoring was added and \na tow truck stationed at the south end of the bridge during morning rush hour. \n\nIn 2014, the adjustment of vehicle lane widths allowed bike-lane widening to improve safety for cyclists.\n\nIn May 1981, a Cessna 172, that ran out of fuel, crash landed on the bridge deck, but caused no injuries.\n\nSince completion of the north runway in 1996, primarily used for landings, signs have warned bridge traffic of low flying aircraft.\n\nThe Middle Arm SkyTrain Bridge, which opened in 2009, passes over the Arthur Laing southern approach.\n"}

{"id": "2313819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313819", "title": "Supraspinatus muscle", "text": "Supraspinatus muscle\n\nThe supraspinatus (plural \"supraspinati\") is a relatively small muscle of the upper back that runs from the supraspinous fossa superior portion of the scapula (shoulder blade) to the greater tubercle of the humerus. It is one of the four rotator cuff muscles and also abducts the arm at the shoulder. The spine of the scapula separates the supraspinatus muscle from the infraspinatus muscle, which originates below the spine.\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle arises from the supraspinous fossa, a shallow depression in the body of the scapula above its spine. The supraspinatus muscle tendon passes laterally beneath the cover of the acromion. Research in 1996 showed that the postero-lateral origin was more lateral than classically described.\n\nThe supraspinatus tendon is inserted into the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The distal attachments of the three rotator cuff muscles that insert into the greater tubercle of the humerus can be abbreviated as SIT when viewed from superior to inferior (for supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor), or SITS when the subscapularis muscle, which attaches to the lesser tubercle of the humerus, is included.\n\nThe suprascapular nerve (C5) innervates the supraspinatus muscle as well as the infraspinatus muscle. It comes from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. \nThis nerve can be damaged along its course in fractures of the overlying clavicle, which can reduce the person's ability to initiate the abduction.\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle performs abduction of the arm, and pulls the head of the humerus medially towards the glenoid cavity. It independently prevents the head of the humerus to slip inferiorly. The supraspinatus works in cooperation with the deltoid muscle to perform abduction, including when the arm is in adducted position. Beyond 15 degrees the deltoid muscle becomes increasingly more effective at abducting the arm and becomes the main propagator of this action.\n\nAntero-posterior projectional radiography of the shoulder may demonstrate a high-riding humeral head, with an acromiohumeral distance of less than 7 mm.\nOne study has indicated that arthroscopic surgery for full-thickness supraspinatus tears is effective for improving shoulder functionality.\n\nA comparative effectiveness review of nonoperative and operative treatments for rotator cuff tears was performed at the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center in 2010. The review identified one study which reported that, \"Patients receiving early surgery had superior function compared with the delayed surgical group\". The review noted that the level of significance of the study was not reported, and the review chose not to include it as one of their conclusions. Instead it concluded that \"The paucity of evidence related to early versus delayed surgery is of particular concern, as patients and providers must decide whether to attempt initial nonoperative management or proceed immediately with surgical repair\". In terms of operative techniques, differences in neither cuff integrity nor shoulder function were reported in studies comparing single-row versus double-row suture anchor fixation and mattress locking versus absorbable sutures. Postoperatively, a slight advantage was evident in patients who performed continuous passive motion alongside physical therapy, as opposed to those who solely performed physical therapy. There is insufficient evidence to adequately compare the effects of operative against nonoperative interventions. Complications were reported very seldom, or were not determined to be clinically significant.\n\nA 2016 study evaluating the effectiveness of arthroscopic treatment of rotator cuff calcification firmly supported surgical intervention. Calcification of the supraspinatus tendon is a major contributor to shoulder pain in the general population and is often worsened following a supraspinatus tear. The results of the study included the return to sports and original functionality of 95.8% of the patients after a mean of 5.3 post-operative months. A significant decrease in pain was observed over time following removal of the calcification. The study showed the overall effectiveness of arthroscopic procedures on shoulder repair, and the lack of risk experienced. Before surgery, supraspinatus tendonitis should be ruled out as the cause of pain.\n\n"}

{"id": "2313837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313837", "title": "Graphical identification and authentication", "text": "Graphical identification and authentication\n\nThe graphical identification and authentication (GINA) is a component of Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that provides secure authentication and interactive logon services. GINA is a replaceable dynamically linked library that is loaded early in the boot process in the context of Winlogon when the machine is started. It is responsible for handling the secure attention sequence, typically Control-Alt-Delete, and interacting with the user when this sequence is received. GINA is also responsible for starting initial processes for a user (such as the Windows Shell) when they first log on. GINA is discontinued in Windows Vista.\n\nA default GINA library, MSGINA.DLL, is provided by Microsoft as part of the operating system, and offers the following features:\n\nWinlogon can be configured to use a different GINA, providing for non-standard authentication methods such as smart card readers or identification based on biometrics, or to provide an alternate visual interface to the default GINA. Developers who implement a replacement GINA are required to provide implementations for a set of API calls which cover functionality such as displaying a \"workstation locked\" dialog, processing the secure attention sequence in various user states, responding to queries as to whether or not locking the workstation is an allowed action, supporting the collection of user credentials on Terminal Services-based connections, and interacting with a screensaver.\n\nA custom GINA could be made entirely from scratch, or just be the original GINA with modifications. A custom GINA can be specified by placing a string named GinaDLL in the registry location codice_1. The Winlogon component is solely responsible for calling these APIs in the GINA library.\n\nWhen the Winlogon process starts, it compares its version number to that which is supported by the loaded GINA library. If the GINA library is of a higher version than Winlogon, Windows will not boot. This is done because a GINA library written for a given version of Winlogon will expect a certain set of API calls to be provided by Winlogon.\n\nSupport for replaceable GINA DLLs was introduced with Windows NT Server 3.51 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP3. Successive versions of Windows have introduced additional functionality into Winlogon, resulting in additional functionality that can be implemented by a replacement GINA. Windows 2000, for example, introduced support for displaying status messages (including verbose messages that can be turned on through Group Policy) about the current state to the user (e.g. \"Applying computer settings.\"), and starting applications in the user's context; this facilitates restarting Windows Explorer automatically if it crashes, as well as starting the Task Manager. Windows XP introduced support for Fast User Switching, Remote Desktop and a more interactive, simplified and user-friendly full-screen logon.\n\nIn Windows Vista, GINA has been replaced by credential providers, which allow for significantly increased flexibility in supporting multiple credential collection methods. To support the use of multiple GINA models, a complex chaining method used to be required and custom GINAs often did not work with fast user switching. GINA libraries do not work with Windows Vista and later Windows versions. One difference, however, is that GINA could completely replace the Windows logon user interface; Credential Providers cannot.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2313845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313845", "title": "Airport lounge", "text": "Airport lounge\n\nAn airport lounge is a facility operated at many airports. Airport lounges offer, for selected passengers, comforts beyond those afforded in the airport terminal itself, such as more comfortable seating, quieter environments, and often better access to customer service representatives. Other accommodations may include private meeting rooms, telephones, wireless internet access and other business services, along with provisions to enhance passenger comfort, such as free drinks, snacks, magazines, and showers.\n\nThe American Airlines Admirals Club was the first airport lounge when it opened at New York City's La Guardia Airport, in 1939. Then AA president C. R. Smith conceived it as a promotional tool.\n\nAirlines operate airline lounges as a service to premium passengers, usually passengers flying first class and business class, with high level frequent flyer status, and premium travel credit card memberships.\n\nMost major carriers have one or more lounges in their hubs and focus cities as well as in the major airports they serve. The major US airlines—American (Admirals Club), Delta (Delta Sky Club), and United (United Club)—operate dozens of lounges, while smaller airlines like Alaska Airlines (Alaska Lounge) tend to only operate a handful of lounges in their hub and focus cities.\n\nAirlines outside of Australia and North America generally do not sell lounge memberships, and instead reserve lounge access exclusively for very frequent flyers and passengers in premium cabins. However, a passenger who has a lounge membership in an airline in one of the three major airline alliances (Oneworld, SkyTeam, or Star Alliance) may have access to the lounges of the other members of that alliance. For example, Qantas Club membership provides access to the Admirals Club lounges due to a reciprocal arrangement with American Airlines; similarly, a member of the United Club or other Star Alliance members can access lounges of Air Canada and Air New Zealand.\n\nIt is, however, not uncommon for non-alliance members to agree individually to allow usage of each other's lounges. For example, although Alaska Airlines operates just six Alaska Lounges, its members have access to American Airlines Admirals Club (and vice versa). Alaska Lounge members cannot, however, access the lounges of other Oneworld members, such as British Airways or Japan Airlines.\n\nPrivate companies, such as Aspire Lounges by Swissport, Plaza Premium Lounge, and Global Lounge Network, also operate generic \"pay-per-use\" lounges. In contrast to airline lounges, these facilities are open to any traveller traversing the airport, regardless of class of ticket or airline, subject to payment of a fee. Most only offer day passes, but some also offer yearly and lifetime memberships. Access to the lounges can be booked via online platforms such as LoungeBuddy or, in limited cases, one-day passes can be purchased directly at the lounge entrance.\n\nFor many airlines, a first class lounge will also be offered to international first class and top-tier passengers. First class lounges are usually more exclusive and will feature extra amenities over business class that are more in line with the European/Asian concept of an airport lounge. In the few cases where an amenity is offered only in the business class lounge, first class passengers are permitted to use the business lounge if they wish. In any case, anyone with first class lounge access almost automatically has access to the business class lounge—such as if a traveling companion is not in first class and cannot be brought into the first class lounge as a guest. In most cases, airlines will offer first class passengers a free pass to their standard airport club. Some airlines offer \"arrival lounges\" for passengers to shower, rest, and eat after a long-haul international flight.\n\nAccess to airport lounges may be obtained in several ways. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, a common method to gain access is by purchasing an annual or a lifetime membership, while in Asia and Europe this is usually impossible. Membership fees are sometimes discounted for elite members of an airline's frequent flyer program and may often be paid using miles. Certain high-end credit cards associated with an airline or lounge network, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Delta Reserve, and United MileagePlus Club credit cards, include membership to the lounges for as long as one owns the card.\n\nLounge access can also be attained with an airline status card, which is common in Europe. The top frequent-flyer levels often offer access to any of an airline's lounges or partner airlines' lounges, when traveling in any class of travel on any of the partner airlines (usually it is required for the cardholder to be booked on one of the carrier's flights within the next 24 hours). Most airlines also usually offer free lounge access to anyone in their premium cabins (first class or business class) on their days of travel; in North America this is usually only available to passengers on intercontinental or transcontinental flights.\n\nPay-per-use lounges can be accessed by anyone, irrespective of airline or flight class. Some offer further benefits when booking directly with them rather than through a reseller.\n\nIndependent programs, such as Priority Pass, offer access to selected airline lounges for an annual fee, while Go Simply, Holiday Extras, LoungePass, and some offerings by independent and airline lounge programs offer pay per use and/or prebookable access without need for membership. Premium credit and charge cards such as Diners Club International, and the American Express Platinum and Centurion Card charge cards offer lounge programs for members. Some banks, like ABN Amro and HSBC, offer lounge access for premium clients. American Express also offers access to lounges belonging to Priority Pass and is expanding its own line of lounges.\n\nBesides offering more comfortable seating, lounges usually provide complimentary alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and light snacks such as fruit, cheese, soup, pastries and breakfast items. In the United States and Canada, nearly all domestic lounges offer an open bar for domestic beer, house wine and well liquor. In the United States, premium beverages such as imported beer, top-shelf liquor, high end wines and champagne are often available for purchase. In U.S. states where open bars are prohibited by law, non-premium beverages may be sold at a token rate (e.g. $1 per drink).\n\nOther amenities typically include flight information monitors, televisions, newspapers, and magazines, plus business centers with desks, internet workstations, telephones, photocopiers and fax services. Complimentary wireless Internet access for patrons is also common.\n\nIn Asia, Europe and the Middle East, lounges (especially those for first class passengers) can be quite luxurious, offering an extensive premium open bar, full hot and cold buffet meals, cigar rooms, spa and massage services, fitness centers, private cabanas, nap suites and showers.\n\nSome lounges have pool tables as amenities. Additionally, there are wireless charging stations in lounges, at some airports in London, installed by Nokia.\n"}
{"id": "2313853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313853", "title": "National secondary road", "text": "National secondary road\n\nA national secondary road () is a category of road in Ireland. These roads form an important part of the national route network, but are secondary to the main arterial routes which are classified as national primary roads. National secondary roads are designated with route numbers higher than those used for primary roads, but with the same \"N\" prefix. Routes N51 and higher are all national secondary roads.\n\nNational secondary roads have a default speed limit of 100 km/h (62.5 mph) as, along with national primary routes, they fall into the speed limit category of \"national roads\".\n\nThere are 2657 km of national secondary roads in Ireland, making up slightly over 50% of the entire national route (national primary and national secondary) network. National secondary routes are generally more poorly maintained than primary routes (although their quality can vary widely), but often carry more traffic than regional roads. Almost the entire network of national secondary roads is single carriageway, although there are some short sections of dual carriageway on the Tallaght bypass section of the N81, on the N52 at Dundalk, on the N85 at Ennis, on \nthe N67 at Galway, on\nthe N62 at Athlone, on the N69 at Tralee and on the N71 between Cork and Bandon. Typically, national secondary roads are of a similar standard or higher than regional roads although some are of lower quality than the better sections of regional roads. Many of them have been resurfaced with higher quality pavements in recent years with relatively smooth surfaces and good road markings and signposting. However, road widths and alignments are often inadequate, with many narrow and winding sections. \nIn the past, most national secondary roads would have run through the centres of the towns on their routes; however, that is becoming less and less often the case. For example: \n\nThe former N8 bypass of Mitchelstown was re-classified as the N73 when the Fermoy (Moorepark) to Kilbehenny section of the M8 was completed.\n\nMost national secondary roads were originally Trunk Roads under the old system of road classification in Ireland, although some sections of national secondary routes were formerly Link Roads. Many less important Trunk Roads became regional roads when the road classification system changed from 1977 onward, including some roads, such as the N72 between Killarney and Killorglin, the N86 and the N87, which were originally re-classified as regional roads but later re-classified again as national secondary routes. In 1994, three national secondary roads were reclassified as national primary roads: the N57 between Swinford and Ballina became the N26, the N64 between Oranmore and Claregalway became part of the N18 and the N79 between New Ross and Enniscorthy became the N30. In addition, a section of the N60 between Castlebar and Westport became part of the N5.\n\nSome national secondary roads, though not arterial routes between major cities, connect scenic areas to major population centres. For example, the N59 through County Galway and County Mayo, the N70 road through County Kerry (see Ring of Kerry) and the N71 through West Cork. For this reason, many national secondary roads are well-traveled by tourists.\n\n(XXXX) = Junction with road XXXX, e.g. (N21) = Junction with N21 road\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2313854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313854", "title": "Feast at Swan Goose Gate", "text": "Feast at Swan Goose Gate\n\nThe Feast at Swan Goose Gate, also known as the \"Banquet at Hongmen\", \"Hongmen Banquet\", \"Hongmen Feast\" and other similar renditions, was a historical event that took place in 206 BC at Hong Gate () outside Xianyang, the capital of the Qin dynasty. Its location in present-day China is roughly at Hongmenbao Village, Xinfeng Town, Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The main parties involved in the banquet were Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, two prominent leaders of insurgent forces who rebelled against the Qin dynasty from 209–206 BC. The event was one of the highlights of the Chu–Han Contention, a power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu which concluded with Xiang Yu's defeat and the establishment of the Han dynasty with Liu Bang as its first emperor. The Feast at Hong Gate is often memorialised in Chinese history, fiction and popular culture.\n\nBetween 209 BC and 206 BC, rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Some of these insurgent forces claimed to be restoring the former six states which were annexed by the Qin state in a series of wars from 230–221 BC. Liu Bang and Xiang Yu were two prominent leaders who emerged from among the rebels. In 208 BC, Xiang Yu and his uncle Xiang Liang installed King Huai II as the nominal ruler of the Chu state while they were actually the ones in power. In late 208 BC, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao so the Chu military came under King Huai II's control. King Huai II sent Xiang Yu and Liu Bang to lead two separate forces to attack the Qin heartland of Guanzhong, and promised that whoever entered that region first would be granted the title of \"King of Guanzhong\".\n\nIn late 207 BC, Liu Bang's rebel army conquered Wu Pass and seized control of Guanzhong and the Qin capital Xianyang. The last Qin emperor Ziying surrendered to Liu Bang, marking the end of the Qin dynasty. After occupying Xianyang, Liu Bang gave strict orders to his men, forbidding them from looting and pillaging the city and harming the civilian populace. Liu Bang also sent troops to garrison at Hangu Pass to block Xiang Yu from entering Guanzhong. Around the time, Xiang Yu's force had just defeated a Qin army led by Zhang Han at the Battle of Julu. When Xiang Yu arrived at Hangu Pass, he was displeased to hear that Liu Bang had already occupied Guanzhong, so he attacked and conquered the pass, pushing on to west of Xishui (戲水). Liu Bang and his army were based in Bashang (霸上) then. The strengths of Xiang Yu and Liu Bang's forces then were estimated to be 400,000 and 100,000 respectively.\n\nCao Wushang (曹無傷), a defector from Liu Bang's side, secretly sent a messenger to Xiang Yu's camp, telling Xiang that Liu Bang was planning to declare himself \"King of Guanzhong\" in accordance with King Huai II's earlier promise, while Ziying would be Liu's chancellor. Cao Wushang also added that Liu Bang had seized all the riches of Xianyang for himself. Xiang Yu was furious when he heard this and planned to attack Liu Bang. Xiang Yu's advisor Fan Zeng felt that Liu Bang posed a threat to his lord so he urged Xiang Yu to eliminate Liu Bang as soon as possible.\n\nOne of Xiang Yu's uncles, Xiang Bo, shared a close friendship with Liu Bang's advisor Zhang Liang. Xiang Bo feared for his friend's life so he sneaked to Liu Bang's camp to warn Zhang Liang about the peril he was in, telling Zhang to flee. Liu Bang was shocked when Zhang Liang related the news to him, and he sought advice from Zhang to avoid danger. Zhang Liang instructed Liu Bang to enlist the help of Xiang Bo to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions. Liu Bang met Xiang Bo and treated him like an honoured guest, flattering Xiang Bo and pretending to arrange for a marriage between his son and Xiang Bo's daughter while asking Xiang Bo to plead with Xiang Yu on his behalf. When Xiang Bo returned to Xiang Yu's camp later, he assured his nephew that Liu Bang had no ill intentions, and conveyed Liu Bang's message that he was willing to submit to Xiang Yu.\n\nThe following day, Liu Bang brought around 100 men with him to meet Xiang Yu at Hong Gate (鴻門), where Xiang had prepared a banquet to entertain him. Liu Bang explained that he managed to enter Guanzhong first because of sheer luck, and apologised to Xiang Yu for robbing him of his glory while extolling Xiang's valour in battle. Liu Bang also explained that the misunderstanding was caused by vile words from someone plotting to sow discord between him and Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu then pointed out that it was Cao Wushang who told him about Liu Bang's supposed intentions. He invited Liu Bang to partake in the banquet.\n\nThe main parties involved in the feast were seated in the following arrangement: Xiang Yu and Xiang Bo faced east; Fan Zeng faced south; Liu Bang faced north; Zhang Liang faced west (known as servant's seat). By the custom of Qin, the east-facing seat is the most respectable place, usually reserved for the guest (in this case would have been Liu Bang), while south-facing seat is reserved for the Emperor, while his servant ministers would be facing north; thus, the seating arrangement indicates that Xiang Yu merely treat Liu Bang as one of his underling; while Liu Bang, by taking the north facing seat, accepted his subservient role and thus would not harm Xiang Yu.\n\nDuring the banquet, Fan Zeng made signals and hinted many times to Xiang Yu to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang ignored him. Fan Zeng then summoned Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang, instructing him to pretend to perform a sword dance to entertain the guests and find an opportunity to assassinate Liu Bang. Xiang Zhuang started dancing after Xiang Yu approved, but Xiang Bo offered to join the performance and he blocked Xiang Zhuang with his body whenever the latter thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nIn the meantime, Zhang Liang left the feast and went outside to summon Liu Bang's general Fan Kuai. He gave some instructions to Fan Kuai and returned to his seat. Fan Kuai then burst into the banquet area despite not being invited, dressed in full armour and armed with his sword and shield, interrupting the sword dance and glaring at Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu was impressed with Fan Kuai's bravado and asked for his name, calling him a \"brave warrior\" (壯士). He ordered his men to give Fan Kuai a goblet of wine, which Fan gulped down. Xiang Yu then offered Fan Kuai a cut of meat (a pork shoulder). Fan Kuai placed the meat on his shield and used his sword to cut off chunks and eat. Xiang Yu was even more impressed and he asked Fan Kuai if he wanted more wine. Fan Kuai then made a lengthy speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments, stating how it would be unjust for Xiang Yu to kill Liu, but also implicitly affirming that Liu would not challenge Xiang's authority.\n\nXiang Yu did not respond and he invited Fan Kuai to join the banquet.\n\nLiu Bang later said that he needed to use the latrine so he left the banquet with Fan Kuai. Shortly after, Xiang Yu sent Chen Ping to call Liu Bang back to the feast. Liu Bang felt that he should bid Xiang Yu farewell but Fan Kuai opposed his decision.\n\nFan Kuai was essentially reminding Liu Bang that their lives were in Xiang Yu's hands and they should escape as soon as they had a chance. He then chose a horse for Liu Bang to ride and Liu escaped, with Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying, Jin Jiang (靳疆) and Ji Xin accompanying him on foot.\n\nBefore his escape, Liu Bang gave Zhang Liang a pair of jade tablets and a pair of jade measuring cups, telling him to present them to Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng respectively. Zhang Liang returned to his seat and presented the gifts to Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng, while apologising on Liu Bang's behalf for leaving without bidding farewell and giving an excuse that Liu was already drunk and unable to continue participating in the feast. Xiang Yu accepted the jade tablets but Fan Zeng threw the jade cups to the ground and cut them to pieces with his sword, predicting that Liu Bang would take away the empire from Xiang Yu one day.\n\nLiu Bang had Cao Wushang executed after returning to his camp.\n\nFan Zeng's prediction came true in 202 BC as Xiang Yu eventually lost to Liu Bang in the power struggle for supremacy over China from 206–202 BC, known as the Chu–Han Contention. Xiang Yu committed suicide after his defeat at the Battle of Gaixia, while Liu Bang established the Han dynasty and became its first emperor.\n\nIn Chinese culture, the term \"Hong Men Yan\" (\"Feast at Swan Goose Gate\") is used figuratively to refer to a trap or a situation ostensibly joyous but in fact treacherous. Another idiom that relates to the event is \"項莊舞劍，意在沛公\" \n(), meaning that a person's actions were intended to be a veiled attack on another person.\n\nThe Chinese title of the 2011 film \"White Vengeance\" is a reference to the Feast at Hong Gate, while the plot itself is based on this historical incident and other events in the Chu–Han Contention.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2313855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313855", "title": "Video painting", "text": "Video painting\n\nVideo painting is a form of video art presented via projectors, LCD or other flat panel display and wall-mounted in the same manner as traditional paintings. Video painting is a relatively new concept that was first coined by Brian Eno in the 1980s to refer to his experimentations with long-form video art. It was later developed upon by Hilary Lawson, who published his theory of closure, in his book (2001). Key conventions, according to Lawson, are that the camera is motionless on a fixed standpoint with no dialogue or sound. The process is uninhabited and pure with all content remaining natural to its original form, free from any constructed editing or manipulation of the image.\n\nVideo painting began as a way for Eno to expand upon the ambient philosophy of his music in a visual form. He explained the coinage and practice of video painting to NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"\n\nThe idea of video painting was later taken up in Hilary Lawson’s theory of Closure (published 2001), in which he proposed that the world is open and that we close that openness with thought and language. He reinterpreted art as the attempt to avoid closure and approach openness.\n\nMoving away from his documentary film background, Lawson set about creating a narrative-less frame which he hoped would avoid closure. Working with a close friend and artist, Sanchita Islam, a small initial group was formed which also included artists William Raban, Isabelle Inghillieri, Nina Danino and Tina Keane. The group met regularly and discussed and shared their work.\n\nFlatscreen technologies such as plasma, LCD, DLP and the up-and-coming OLED displays are on the cusp of exploding in terms of marketplace penetration. Currently, the market offers both existing hybrid (video projection boxes) and true flatscreen technologies, and video art projections using cutting-edge projection technology. Even as these devices are being steadily introduced to our domestic and creative cultural spheres, more revolutionary technologies are being developed and implemented. Bill Buxton (University of Toronto, former chief scientist for Alias Wave Front and Silicon Graphics) maintains that gel, thin film, and painted surface video technologies are the inevitable next step in this development. Massively large scale moving images, beyond anything we have experienced, will be part of our everyday lives. As a result our domestic (and public) visual spaces will be profoundly transformed.\n\nThere are several artists and designers who are producing video paintings and ambient art that is intended to repurpose the blank space of an idle flatscreen. In addition to this there is an ever increasing number of companies specialising in video paintings to varying degrees. Companies such as Plasma Window, Vat19, Digital Hotcakes have all contributed to this growing phenomenon often providing the archetypal classical ambient video paintings. These companies and increasingly other artists and companies are expanding the availability of this genre. Ambient Digital Art have evolved the concept to more specialised markets including bespoke personalised service additionally with expansion into the realm of generative art.\n\nTransLumen Technologies was founded in 2000 and applied for patents on imperceptibly different images or Subthreshold Extreme Gradual Change (STEGC) also called Fluid Stills Art Illusions. These patents were subsequently awarded and additional patents filed. TransLumen creates and provides ambient video DVD’s, HD and custom installations. They specialize in ultra-slow-motion technology and video painting.\n\nJim Bizzocchi, an artist and Assistant Professor at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology, describes the new form: \"Ambient video will emerge as a supremely pictorial form - relying on visual impact and the subtle manipulation of image, layer, flow, and transition. It sits in the visual background of our lives - always changing, but never too quickly. It does not conquer, it seduces. It rewards attention, but never commands it. Rather, its aim is to support whatever level of attention the viewer cares to bestow in the moment: a passing glance, a more intentional look, or a longer and deeper immersion within the dynamically changing experience of an ambient video world.\" Bizzochi must be credited with advancing the academic study of this phenomenon from his earliest papers on streaming video and other academic papers on video paintings.\n\nNomIg were among the first to create video paintings with their 2001 piece ‘Ad Infinitum’. Working as audiovisual artists, the NomIg. duo questioned what would happen if the concepts of Eno's ambient works were applied to the visual domain. As a result their works place paramount importance on fluidity of movement; an absence of direct cuts/edits; and the removal of a linear time experience for the viewer. Their video paintings are centered on near-imperceptible movement where the works cause the viewer to question whether there is any movement at all. Upon a passing glance the work appears to be still - it is only after a returning glance or concentrated awareness that the motion of the piece reveals itself. Their work takes a fleeting second and expands it into a timeless contemplation of the moment. To achieve their extreme slow motion NomIg. have heavily researched and developed editing techniques which layer and blend frames while not succumbing to the artifacts of the standard digital slow motion process (jerky movement, blurry content). The actual duration of their paintings often exceeds 3 hours and are regularly produced in 1080p HD format. They are seamless loops.\n\nIn 2003, while curating the audiovisual component of the New Forms Festival, the nomigs met Bizzocchi and quickly formed an alliance. Bizzocchi's \"Rockface\" was used as the intermission piece during the aforementioned audiovisual evening in place of traditional intermission background music thereby playing with the conventional structure of the ambient paradigm. 2004 saw NomIg. and Bizzocchi team up to curate a video painting exhibition at the 2004 New Forms Festival.\n\nBelieving that this infant art form needs to develop a strong community, NomIg. developed a dedicated video painting & ambient video resource in an effort to grow the video painting community as well as offer a resource for those looking for information about video painting in general.\n\n2007 sees NomIg. continue to advance the video painting form with a newly developed slow-motion technique; artistic manipulation of the display device itself; as well as the integration of the display device into sculptural works.\n\nVisual artist Jeffers Egan has been working with the video painting medium for some time, producing works described as references to Rothko and Pollock.\n\nMalcolm Daniel (who was involved in the New Forms Festival exhibition mentioned below) has recently started producing a series of work as well. To the rich tapestry of ambient video, Malcolm Daniel adds commentary on culture and society with his Video Paintings. Filmed on location in India, Malcolm’s works speak to the integration of society and spiritualism that is so prominent to the region. The cultural significance of this relationship is explored through layering and slow motion effects which serve to foster an ethereal and meditative presence for the viewer.\n\nAn early pioneer of the ambient video art movement and video painting is Douglas R. Siefken. His first public exhibit of the Fluid Stills artform was sponsored by Sony on 02/02/02 at the Julia Friedman Gallery in Chicago. Doug is a founder and Chief Technology Officer of TransLumen Technologies, LLC. Their Fluid Stills Art Illusions are a new genre of art merging with technology. The art imbues each digital frame with the integrity of an independent artistic still that cohesively changes over time without any visible or detectable change as that change occurs, creating a serene, temporally streaming subthreshold ultra-slow motion video composition. This tranquil and harmonious art form obviates the visual noise and environmental disruption presented by some other digital art alternatives. Doug has a version of the Chicago Skyline series that was installed at the Hotel Cass, Chicago in August 2007. The piece is running on an 80” DLP screen in the main lobby. In 2008 Chicago’s Mayor Daley was flanked by two images from that series on large screens at a luncheon.\n\nOne of the early participants in the growing ambient video genre, Detourdvd have been designing ambient video since 2003. Slow moving videos, with no audio track play in infinite loops, the Detourdvd Collection references modern design themes, with some titles available in a choice of color palettes. With sales of flatscreens soaring (Keepmedia), and with the new, sleek screens on display instead of being hidden away in an armoir or closet, more people are searching for sources moving art to display in their homes. As Jim Bizzocchi says, \"We believe artists will use the flat-panel displays as frames for \"video paintings\"—slow moving but highly pictorial works of televisual art that explore light, shape, texture and motion. The next decade will be a rich test-bed for new forms of domestic visual art.\"\n\n\n\n"}

At a very young age she felt more like a girl, and expressed more interest in the clothing and articles of little girls. She helped a second-hand goods dealer clear out the apartments of deported Jews and sometimes kept items.\n\nMax Berfelde, Charlotte's father, was already a member of the Nazi Party by the late 1920s and he had become a party leader in Mahlsdorf. In 1942 he forced Charlotte to join the Hitler Youth. They often quarreled, but the situation escalated in 1944 when her mother left the family during the evacuation. Max demanded that Charlotte choose between parents, threatening her with a gun and leaving her in a room with an hour to choose; when he came in to kill her, she struck him with a rolling pin and killed him. In January 1945, after several weeks in a psychiatric institution, Charlotte was sentenced by a court in Berlin to four years' detention as an anti-social juvenile delinquent. She did not serve the full term because the jails were opened at the end of the war.\n\nWith the fall of the Third Reich, Charlotte was released. She worked as a second-hand goods dealer and dressed in a more feminine way. She began going by \"Lottchen\". She loved older men and became a well-known figure in the city as von Mahlsdorf. She began collecting household items, thus saving historical everyday items from bombed-out houses. She was also able to take advantage of the clearance of the households of people who left for West Germany.\n\nHer collection evolved into the Gründerzeit Museum. She had become engaged in the preservation of the von Mahlsdorf estate, which was threatened with demolition, and was awarded the manor house rent-free. In 1960, Von Mahlsdorf opened the museum of everyday articles from the \"Gründerzeit\" (the time of the founding of the German Empire) in the only partially-reconstructed Mahlsdorf manor house. The museum became well known in cinematic, artistic and gay circles. From 1970 on, the East Berlin homosexual scene often had meetings and celebrations in the museum.\n\nIn 1974 the East German authorities announced that they wanted to bring the museum and its exhibits under state control. In protest, von Mahlsdorf began giving away the exhibits to visitors. Thanks to the committed involvement of the actress Annekathrin Bürger and the attorney —and possibly also thanks to her enlistment as an \"inoffizieller Mitarbeiter\" (an unofficial collaborator) for Stasi, the secret East German police—the authorities' attempt was stopped in 1976 and she was able to keep the museum.\n\nIn 1991, neo-Nazis attacked one of her celebrations in the museum. Several participants were hurt. At this time, von Mahlsdorf announced she was considering leaving Germany.\n\nIn 1992, she received the Bundesverdienstkreuz, 'Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.'\n\nHer decision to leave Germany meant that she guided her last visitor through the museum in 1995, and in 1997 she moved to Porla Brunn, an old spa near Hasselfors, Sweden, where she opened (with moderate success) a new museum dedicated to the turn of the 19th century. The city of Berlin bought the Gründerzeit Museum, and by 1997 it had been opened again by the \"Förderverein Gutshaus Mahlsdorf e. V.\".\n\nHer life could be described as that of an outsider who survived, no matter the ruling ideology, during the Nazi period, Communist-controlled East Germany, or, once the wall fell, modern Germany, as described in the article \"The Sexual and Political Chameleon of Berlin: The Ambiguities of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf's Life in \"I Am My Own Wife\".”\n\nVon Mahlsdorf died from heart failure during a visit to Berlin on 30 April 2002.\n\nSome of her comments, such as those made in Berlin during a lecture on 12 March 1997, were seen as anti-LGBT and led to a loss of the support of some members of the community. On 21 July 2000, an article on her declining popularity appeared with the subtitle, \"Charlotte von Mahlsdorf disqualified herself as the patron saint of the Lesbian-Gay Park Festival in Berlin,\" quoting her remark: \"\"That lesbians and gays can't have children is, after all, quite natural. Nature, too, seeks out what it can use, what can reproduce, and what can't. If we look at it like that, if lesbians and gays did have children, then we'd have a lot more unemployed people today.\"\"\n\n\"(\"Daß die Lesben und Schwulen keine Kinder kriegen, das ist doch ganz natürlich. Die Natur sucht sich ja auch aus, was sie gebrauchen kann, was sie sich vermehren läßt und was nicht. Und wenn wir's mal so nehmen: Wenn die Lesben und Schwulen nun auch noch Kinder kriegen würden, dann hätten wir heute noch viel mehr Arbeitslose.\")\"\n\nRegardless of these issues, some people still honour her memory, be it for her work as the founder of the Gründerzeit Museum, or for her public role as a transgender woman and her foregrounding of the persecution of homosexuals in both the Third Reich and East Germany. The appeal for a memorial to von Mahlsdorf, organized by the \"Förderverein Gutshaus Mahlsdorf e. V.\" and the \"Interessengemeinschaft Historische Friedhöfe Berlin\" (Alliance of Historical Cemeteries in Berlin) was therefore a success.\n\nThe intention of the organizers was to erect a memorial with the inscription \"\"Ich bin meine eigene Frau (I am my own woman) – Charlotte von Mahlsdorf – 18. März 1928 – 30. April 2002\"\" on the first anniversary of Charlotte's death. However, von Mahlsdorf's relatives demanded the inscription be changed. As questions remained about the disposition of her estate, and the \"Förderverein Gutshaus Mahlsdorf e. V.\" was concerned that her relatives could demand the return of her furniture, they yielded to these demands.\n\nAlthough Charlotte von Mahlsdorf had been known almost exclusively by her \"stage name\" in recent years, her relatives pushed through the inscription \"\"Lothar Berfelde, 1928 – 2002, genannt Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. Dem Museumsgründer zur Erinnerung\" (Lothar Berfelde, 1928 – 2002, known as Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. In memory of the [male] founder of the museum).\"\n\nIn 1992, German filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim made a film about von Mahlsdorf called \"I Am My Own Woman\" (Original title: \"Ich bin meine eigene Frau\") with von Mahlsdorf appearing in the film.\n\n\nAmerican playwright Doug Wright wrote the character play, \"I Am My Own Wife\" based on von Mahlsdorf's life from his own research of her biography. Since its initial run on- and off-Broadway the play has garnered every major American theatre award including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Tony Award, the Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award, the Lucille Lortel Award, and the Lambda Literary Award for Drama.\n\nGerman author , co-author and publisher of von Mahlsdorf's book, has made another play called \"Ich bin meine eigene Frau\". The play had its premiere in spring 2006 at the Schauspiel Leipzig.\n\nLarry Moss and Josef Ludwig Pfitzer made an adaptation of the Doug Wright play called \"Ich mach ja doch, was ich will (I still do what I want)\", that was shown at Teamtheater in May 2012 in Munich, Germany.\n\n\n"}

It links the M7 motorway from just south of Nenagh, County Tipperary to the M1 motorway north of Dundalk in County Louth. The route forms a connection between the north east of Ireland and the mid west traversing the midlands. It interchanges with the M6 at Kilbeggan and at Tyrrellspass, the N4 at Mullingar, the N3 at Kells, and the N2 at Ardee before continuing towards Dundalk. \n\nThe road is long.\n\nThe road is mainly single carriageway two-lane throughout. It has some upgraded sections, but generally the standard is poor or very poor. It starts (from the southwest) at a grade separated junction with the M7 motorway and by-passes Nenagh on its western side as single carriageway. Past Nenagh it is generally a single carriageway with no shoulders all the way to Birr. Many sections of this part of the route are very poor through County Tipperary with sharp bends. The route from Birr to Tullamore was upgraded in recent years and has good alignment, hard shoulders and a good surface as has the section from Tullamore to Kilbeggan which was upgraded in the 1970s. At Tullamore the route forms a bypass of Mucklagh and Tullamore. \n\nThe road forms an interchange on the M6 motorway south of Kilbeggan and follows it eastwards to the Tyrrellspass exit. (Prior to the opening of the M6 the route went through Kilbeggan town and went past the racecourse via Ballinagore). From the Tyrrellspass junction it heads north to Mullingar as the Tyrrellspass eastern bypass and the eastern by-pass of Mullingar (opened May 2007); joins the N4 dual-carriageway just outside Mullingar briefly before leaving to head 5 kilometres east over what was once a notoriously dangerous road to Cloughan, which has since been upgraded. Past Cloughan the route continues on a very poor road to Delvin, Clonmellon, Kells and Ardee before reaching the M1 south of Dundalk. Prior to 2009, the Mullingar to Delvin stretch was an extremely dangerous road, and as of 2016, half of it has been upgraded to wide shouldered road. Eventually the route will be upgraded with the old road used for local access only. Two kilometers of dual-carriageway take it to the R132 (the old N1) from where it becomes the Dundalk eastern inner relief route, over a new bridge near the harbour and north to the N1.\nThe Tullamore bypass is a new single carriageway upgrade to the N52. The route leaves the existing N52 approximately southwest of Tullamore town, intersecting with the N80 road, crossing over the Grand Canal, before rejoining the N52 again north of the town. The scheme began construction in April 2008, and was completed in October 2009. \n\nFour metal figures by sculptor Maurice Harron are located where the new roadway cuts through esker ridges. The figures represent symbols of learning and sanctity. Approaching from the north the 1st figure holds up a chalice, the 2nd a book, the 3rd a crosier and the 4th shows the release of a flock of birds representing souls. The installation was funded by the percentage for arts scheme where 1% of the budget is allocated to roadside art.\n\n\n\n"}

Blackledge is currently a college football television broadcaster.\n\nHis family moved to Princeton, New Jersey, while his father worked as offensive coordinator for the Princeton Tigers football team and Blackledge attended Princeton High School in Princeton, New Jersey, from 1975–76. He returned to the Canton area to finish his high school career at North Canton Hoover High School in North Canton, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1979.\n\nBlackledge was a three-year starter at Penn State, under Coach Joe Paterno, where he guided the Nittany Lions to a 31–5 record including a national championship in 1982. \n\nFollowing the 1982 season, Blackledge won the Davey O'Brien Award for best quarterback in the nation. As a senior, Blackledge threw for 2218 yards with 22 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, while also rushing for three touchdowns.\n\nBlackledge led the Nittany Lions to the national championship with a 27–23 victory over Georgia and Herschel Walker in the 1983 Sugar Bowl. Blackledge was the MVP of the game, throwing for 228 yards and a 4th-quarter 47-yard touchdown to Gregg Garrity.\n\nBlackledge was the seventh pick in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft, chosen by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was picked behind John Elway (#1, Baltimore) but ahead of Dan Marino (#27, Miami), astounding both Marino (who believed that he was better than Blackledge) and Blackledge himself (who had expected to be picked in the middle of the round). He was also drafted ahead of Hall of Famer Jim Kelly (#14 Buffalo), as well as Tony Eason (#15, New England) and Ken O'Brien (#22, New York Jets).\n\nBlackledge was a Chief for five seasons (1983–1987) before ending his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers (1988–1989).

In 2013, he became the Roving Catching Instructor for the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nJeff Pearlman of ESPN.com said of Fasano: \"When I think of Sal Fasano, however, I think of greatness. Not of Willie Mays or Ted Williams greatness, but of a uniquely excellent human being who, were class and decency the most valued standards of a career, would be the easiest Hall of Fame inductee of all time.\"\n\nAfter three seasons in the minor leagues, Fasano made his Major League debut on April 3, for the Royals. He spent the next three seasons splitting catching duties with starter Mike Macfarlane and rising prospect Mike Sweeney. In , he established career highs in at bats (216) and RBI (31). He also ranked second in the American League in HBPs with 16. In his first 4 seasons with the Royals, Fasano batted .219 with 20 home runs and 67 RBI.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics purchased Fasano's contract from the Royals in March of and handed him the team's back up duties behind starter Ramón Hernández. Fasano helped the A's capture the A.L. West division crown that season, and made his, to date, only post season appearance as a defensive replacement. While with Oakland, Fasano says, he came to realize that many players around him were taking anabolic steroids, and briefly considered following suit, but he decided against it. In 63 total games with the Athletics, Fasano hit .190 with 7 home runs and 19 RBI.\n\nOn May 22, 2001, the Royals purchased Fasano from the Athletics. He appeared in only 3 games for the Royals, and went hitless in his lone at-bat before being traded to Colorado.\n\nOn June 24, 2001, Fasano and Mac Suzuki were traded to the Colorado Rockies for Brent Mayne. In 25 games for the Rockies, Fasano hit .254 with 3 home runs and 9 RBI.\n\nOn January 11, 2002, Fasano signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and was released on June 1. On June 6, he signed with the Milwaukee Brewers organization. On July 31, Fasano and Alex Ochoa were traded to the Anaheim Angels for Jorge Fabregas and a player to be named later. Fasano played in only 2 games for the Angels, going 0–1 at the plate with a strikeout. On November 5, 2002, he was released by the Angels. He did not play baseball at any level in 2003, and on January 14, 2004, signed a minor league contact with the New York Yankees. Fasano appeared in 76 games for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 2004, and hit .229 with 10 home runs and 34 RBI.\n\nFasano was released by the Yankees organization on October 15, 2004. On December 16, he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and appeared in 64 games for them during the 2005 season. Fasano had arguably the best season of his Major League career with Baltimore, hitting .250 with 11 home runs and 20 RBI. He became a free agent on October 15, 2005.\n\nFasano began for the Philadelphia Phillies as a backup to Mike Lieberthal. His distinctive Fu Manchu mustache earned him the cult admiration of Phillies fans, who began a Phan Phavorites fan club called Sal's Pals. Fasano showed his gratitude by buying the group tickets and pizza. Fasano began to see more playing time as Lieberthal got injured, eventually taking over the starting role. His light hitting though cost him his job as rookie backstop Chris Coste emerged in Lieberthal's absence. When Lieberthal returned, there was no spot for Fasano. He was designated for assignment and acquired by the New York Yankees in exchange for minor league infielder Hector Made. In 50 games for the Phillies, Fasano hit .243 with 4 home runs and 10 RBI.\n\nOne of Fasano's first acts as a Yankee was to trim his facial hair in accordance with the Yankees' personal appearance policy. He spent the late summer and September as a back-up to Jorge Posada and did not appear in the Yankees' four-game loss to the Detroit Tigers in the Division Series. On August 19, 2006, Fasano made his first career pinch-running appearance, taking the place of fellow catcher Jorge Posada during a 13-5 win over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. During that game, Fasano nearly picked off Manny Ramirez after blocking the plate and denying the Red Sox another run. In 28 games for the Yankees, Fasano batted .143 with 1 home run and 5 RBI.\n\nFasano agreed to a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on January 17, , and was invited to Major League spring training. On April 26, the Blue Jays purchased Fasano's contract from Triple-A Syracuse of the International League in order to fill a void left by an injury to Gregg Zaun. During this time, he shared catching responsibilities with Jason Phillips. His first at bat as a Blue Jay came against the Texas Rangers on April 28. Following the return of Zaun, the Blue Jays designated Fasano for assignment on June 13 and sent him outright to Syracuse on June 16.\n\nAt Syracuse, he hit .413 and earned a surprise call-up to the Blue Jays. He had a .178 average with 1 home run and 4 RBI in 16 games during his brief stint as a replacement for the injured Zaun. He finished the season as a member of the Blue Jays 40-man roster and the back-up to Gregg Zaun and Curtis Thigpen. On March 25, 2008, Fasano was released by the Blue Jays.\n\nOn April 11, 2008, Fasano signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Braves and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Richmond Braves. In 26 games for Richmond, Fasano hit .193 with 2 home runs and 9 RBI.\n\nOn June 19, 2008, Fasano was traded by the Braves to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later and assigned to the Major League team as a backup for Kelly Shoppach with Víctor Martínez on the disabled list. In 15 games for the Indians in 2008, Fasano batted .261 with 6 RBI.\n\nOn February 10, , Fasano signed a minor league deal to return to the Rockies. He was also extended an invitation to Major League spring training. Fasano played the entire 2009 season in Triple-A, batting .236 with 4 home runs and 21 RBI in 61 games for Colorado Springs, and retired at the end of the season.\n\nOn November 25, 2009, Fasano returned to the Blue Jays organization, taking a managerial job for their Single-A affiliate, the Lansing Lugnuts. He finished managing Lugnuts with a record of 70-69 (.504).\n\nOn November 28, 2010, Fasano accepted the position as the manager of the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, the Double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nIn 2011, Fasano was named Double-A Manager of the Year for leading the New Hampshire Fisher Cats to an Eastern League championship win. During the offseason, Fasano was given the position of Roving Catching Instructor in Player Development. Gary Allenson was named manager of the Fisher Cats.\n\nAfter being dismissed from the Blue Jays staff, Fasano became the manager for the Mobile BayBears for the 2017 season. The season ended with a record of 34–36 (.486).\n\nIn the fall of 2017, Fasano took a job as the catching instructor for the Atlanta Braves. This is the first coaching job that he has had in Major League Baseball.\n\nFasano is the son of Vincent and Nella Fasano, Italian immigrants who settled in the Chicago area. He graduated from Hoffman Estates High School in Illinois and is married to Kerri Kubinski, who was a volleyball player at Evansville. Fasano is a born-again Christian; he was introduced to spirituality by Kansas City teammate Keith Lockhart and credits religion with curtailing his desire to drink. Sal and Kerri have three children: Vincenzo, Angelo, and Santino. Santino was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and was successfully operated on.\n\n"}

For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.\n\nD&W Food Centers began using Spartan as a supply in 1961 following soon supplied with Spartan and D&W private label products. In 2000, D&W switched to Supervalu.\n\nIn 2000, Spartan Stores bought the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. By 2003, the company had discontinued Food Town operations.\n\nIn 2005, Spartan was expected to purchase Farmer Jack chain, but did not consider Farmer Jack a good acquisition. The company agreed to acquire D&W Food Centers, Inc. in March 2006. In 2007, Spartan acquired the Felpausch chain consisting of 20 stores, nine with in-house pharmacies, three convenience stores, and two fuel centers.\nIn April 2008, Spartan announced that the store and customer lists of 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two Michigan stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand. In October 2008, Spartan announced it would purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.\n\nIn February 2011, the last Felpausch in Coldwater switched over to the Family Fare name. 13 Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name starting in May 2013. Three new Valu Land stores were also opened in 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014, while continuing to operate as Spartan Stores, Nash Finch and MDV in their prior markets.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, SpartanNash completed its acquisition of Catio Foods and Blue Ribbon Transport (BRT).\n\nIn March 2017, it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison continued as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retired as CEO in late May.\n\nIn 2018, Grocery distributor and retailer SpartanNash announced to their Fergus Falls Sun Mart employees on Friday, June 15, that the location would be aiming for a July 14 closure.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, SpartanNash completed its acquisition of South Bend, Indiana-based Martin's Super Markets.\n\nSource: \n\n\n\n"}

The Broncos had won their first thirteen games, the best start since the undefeated 1972 Dolphins, and were tipped by some to have a realistic chance at winning all nineteen games. The Minnesota Vikings became the first team since the 1968 Baltimore Colts to win all but one of their regular season games and not win the Super Bowl. After no team had won 14 regular season games since the 1992 49ers, three teams went 14–2 or better for the only time in a 16-game season.\n\n\"Football Outsiders\" noted:\n\nThe 1998 NFL Draft was held from April 17 to 18, 1998 at New York City's Theater at Madison Square Garden. With the first pick, the Indianapolis Colts selected quarterback Peyton Manning from the University of Tennessee.\n\nDale Hamer and Gary Lane returned to head linesman and side judge, respectively. Tony Corrente and Ron Winter were promoted to referee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first season that CBS held the rights to televise American Football Conference games, taking over the package from NBC. Meanwhile, this was the first time that ESPN broadcast all of the Sunday night games throughout the season (this was also the first season in which ESPN's coverage used the \"Monday Night Football\" themes, before reverting to using an original theme in 2001). This was also the first season where the late games kicked off at 4:05pm ET & 4:15pm ET (replacing the original 4:00pm ET start time), to give more time to finish the early games before the start of the late games.

In 1989 Bär joined Mr. Bungle and studied music at Humboldt State University, where he met Trevor Dunn and Trey Spruance. His primary instrument is the saxophone, but he plays a number of other instruments including flute, keyboards, guitar, drums, percussion, bass and other assorted woodwinds.\n\nHe was a member of Mr. Bungle from 1989 to their disbandment in 2000, and has written and performed with Secret Chiefs 3, Dieselhed and Humboldt County hip hop/reggae/rock fusion band Lakota. He has also appeared on the Melt-Banana album \"Charlie\", on the Carl Hancock Rux album \"Rux Revue\", on the Ray's Vast Basement album \"On the Banks of the Time\", on the Eyvind Kang's album \"The Story of Iceland\" and on the Barefoot Hockey Goalie album \"One Part Thomas Edison\". Bär McKinnon is currently gigging around Melbourne with a band called Umläut.\n\nBungle's lead singer Mike Patton had by the start of the 1990s achieved success in mainstream rock and metal with his other band Faith No More, which ultimately helped secure Mr. Bungle a record deal with Warner Bros. The band released a self-titled album (produced by John Zorn) in 1991, followed by the highly surreal \"Disco Volante\" in 1995. Their final album was \"California\". As a multi-instrumentalist, Bär provided a distinct style both as a player and songwriter, most notably on Mr. Bungle's final album, \"California\". The album takes inspiration from Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys, influences close to Bär's heart. The album allowed more freedom for all members of Bungle in the songwriting process.\n\"California\" blended lounge, pop, jazz, funk, thrash metal, Hawaiian, Middle Eastern, kecak and avant-garde music. The band did 5 tours to support this record. For the most part, perhaps with the exception of the Sno-Core 2000 tour where they were often booed, the band did have success attracting an audience.\n\nUmlaut is an experimental progressive band based out of Melbourne, Australia. It is the culmination of years of work for McKinnon. Umlaut’s eclectic musical stylings reside in the same vein as McKinnon’s previous bands Mr. Bungle and Secret Chiefs 3- injecting an energetic and whimsical blend of pop, jazz, avant-garde metal, symphonic atmosphere and electronica into its sound.  \n\nWhen Mr. Bungle officially disbanded, Bär was left with a mountain of material he had written for the band, so he decided to apply it towards a solo venture.  Many of his Umlaut bandmates found him based on his prior music affiliations.  According to McKinnon: \"Melbourne is a very hip place as far as music and musicians and there’s no shortage of good musos so I’m super lucky that I ended up here, it just made the most sense. Musos sought me out, perhaps on the back of Bungle’s notoriety, I mean who knew a Mr Bungle member was living in Melbourne?”\n\nDespite seeing many incarnations and line-up changes through the years, Umlaut has found a comfortable niche in the Melbourne music scene and continues to attract dedicated fans both locally and internationally.\n\nThe band has accompanied comedian Neil Hamburger as well as Secret Chiefs 3 on their various tours in Australia.\n\nBand members\n\n\nGuest performers:\n\n\nRelease Date: 10 October 2009\nLabel: Orchard\n\nThe album’s single \"Atlas Face\" features Mike Patton, Faith No More frontman and fellow Mr. Bungle bandmate, on lead vocals.\n\nReview from Consequence of Sound: \"Sporadic bursts of circus-themed noise. The sludgy guitar grind of heavy metal. Unpredictable blasts of horn instruments. There’s no denying the influence of Mr. Bungle in every note of Umlaut's self-titled album, and how can comparisons not be drawn when the band is the musical venture of Mr. Bungle's saxophonist Clinton \"Bär\" McKinnon. But though it's easy to see where McKinnon is drawing from, the Australian-based Umlaut is a wholly original project that takes a proven, experimental concept and makes it all its own\".\n\nRelease Date: 29 August 2014\nLabel: Romero Records/ Orchard\n\nFrom MusicTrust: \"Unlike the many other bands that seem bent on simply reveling in mad energy generated by constantly shifting and juxtaposing interludes and sections within the one 'song', there is a much higher level of compositional delicacy at play here. It’s obvious that Umlaut has thought long and hard about what should and shouldn’t go into the cauldron. The creation of multilayered textures on 'To Your Poverty Quietly Go' is something lacking in much of the music that gets made using a similar chop and change sensibility\".\n\nRelease date: 19 April 2019\n\nLabel: Romero Records.\n\nFrom Romero Records: \"A very festive new EP from Umlaut, the brainchild of Bär McKinnon (Mr. Bungle, Secret Chiefs 3), 'Arunachala' is equal parts circus jazz, oddball pop and melancholic soundscapes. Sonny Rollins meets Brian Wilson, Pennywise the Clown and the Easter Bunny?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A ZX Spectrum version was programmed by Clive Townsend for Elite Systems in 1987 for their Durell publishing line of games, but was never released; a ROM has since been leaked from a collection of Townsend's ZX Microdrive disk files.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic future during the aftermath of a nuclear war, the player takes control of a warrior who is hired to defeat the gang of an evil dictator. The hero is armed with a sword and shield, but has also been trained in the martial arts.\n\nThe arcade version can be played by up to two players alternating. The game's controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons. Similarly to \"Kung-Fu Master\" and \"Rush'n Attack\", the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies and the other to hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as throwing-knives and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some time, allowing the player to recover them. Power-ups include floating hearts that restore the player's health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.\n\nThe game consists of six stages, where the player will face the usual series of weak enemies, as well as a sub-boss at the middle of each stage and a boss at the end. The player is allowed to start the game at any of the six stages. However, the player must play through the entire game again after defeating the final boss, Achilles, in order to see the true ending (similarly to \"Ghosts'n Goblins\"). The player can continue after a game over depending on the dip switch settings.\n\nThe NES version of \"Trojan\" features several significant changes to the game, such as the addition of new power-ups and hidden rooms, as well as an alternative versus mode, where two players compete against each other in a first-to-three-rounds match, making it Capcom's first attempt at the fighting game genre. Player 1 controls the main character, while Player 2 controls the enemy character, whose abilities are identical to the main character. While the version in \"Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1\" is a direct emulation of the original arcade game, it also allows the option to assign one of the action buttons for jumping in addition to using the directional pad or the analog stick.\n\nAllgame editor Brett Alan Weiss praised the game, commenting \"though not as good or as influential as Ghosts & Goblins or the Mega Man series, Capcom's lesser known Trojan is still a fine game with a nice variety of levels to traverse and an interesting mix of enemies to battle\".\n"}

The race is commonly called the W101, akin to a first year college course, such as Physics 101, at the nearby Penn State University.\n\nThe race was first held in 1991 and been held continuously since 2001. The W101 starts and ends in a small village Coburn, Pennsylvania near Millheim, Pennsylvania. The W101 course is a single loop covering roads, forest roads and trails. The total climbing in the race is approximately 12,000 feet (3,658 meters.) The majority of the course is within the Bald Eagle and Rothrock Pennsylvania State Forests. The event is organized and run primarily by Shenandoah Mountain Touring (located in Harrisonburg, VA) and has been one of the stops of the National Ultra Endurance Series since 2006.\n\nThe Wilderness 101 was first held in 1991 organized by a bicycle shop location in State College, PA (The Bicycle Shop). The owner of the Bicycle Shop, Randy Moore, the shop manager, Michael Hermann (current owner of Purple Lizard Maps) and James Bryant (a local attorney) put together an off-road loop of 101 miles, with the specific goal to be longer than a 100-mile race. They also wanted to do the loop as a point-to-point ride because the early off-road century races were lap races, most held at ski areas. Moore and Hermann were among the early east coast mountain bike pioneers who discovered the trail riding in Rothrock and Bald Eagle State Forests in the late 1980s. The same group held the W101 again in 1992 and 1993 and then stopped holding the race simply because it was getting big, and they decided they didn't really want to be race promoters. In addition to the 101, they held a 30-mile mountain bike race that started and finished in Coburn, PA annually. Moore and Hermann were involved with Grove Innovations at that time, a local well respected handmade mountain bike builder. The races were held to promote the new sport of mountain biking, the unique trails they had in Central PA, and as a fund raiser for the local fire departments. Moore and Hermann weren't interested in being race promoters as much as they just liked to ride. Mountain bike racing was growing in popularity and many other race events were happening on the east coast, and they decided to stop promoting the Coburn race and the 101.\n\nThe inaugural winner of the 1991 race was Harry Winard with a time of 6:59. He was a Penn State student at the time and according to an interview in the Oct 1991 Dirt Rag, only decided to race the event the week before. Harry won the race on a Bridgestone MB-0 mountain bike with very narrow and smooth tires (1.5\" \nAvocet Cross) and a set triathlon aero bars. The modern courses with more trails and rougher trails would reduce the chance of someone winning on such a bicycle. These changes also prohibit comparing the finishing times from the earlier events to the current events.\n\nIt is not known if any women started or finished the 1991 events. The 1992 Woman's winner was Susan Combine John Stamstad, a famous pioneer in endurance and ultra-endurance mountain bike events, won the 1993 race. In these early editions of the race, each finisher was given a shirt after finishing that listed their placing and finish time in felt iron-on letters and numbers.\n\nIn 2001 a company unrelated to the original organization, Shenandoah Mountain Touring from Harrisonburg, VA re-established the race. This organization has now held the race annually since and plans to for the foreseeable future.\n\nJay Duff won the first of the re-established event in 2001. His finishing time of 7:07 cannot be compared to the times of the 2002 and later events as a significantly larger amount of new challenging single-track sections were added.\n\nThe current course records are as follows:\nOpen men: Jeff Schalk, 6:26, 2011\nOpen women: Vicki Barclay, 7:14, 2015\nMaster's men:\nMaster's women:\nSingle Speed Men:\nSingle Speed Women:\n\nThe 1991–1993 race courses were primarily fire-roads and roads. A guide book by Scott Adams, Mountain Bike Madness in Central PA has a write up and map on the course. The early years even included a short section along the margin of a busy highway (rt 322). This section has been rerouted to use a service tunnel under the highway, and the highway itself has been elevated on the return loop so racers use a quieter underpass. The 2001 and later race courses contain substantially more trails and degraded fire-roads. In subsequent years the organizer has added more trails (single-track and double-track) as new trails are opened or their condition improved. Even when new trails are not included, the course often has to be changed to avoid areas closed by forestry operations, changing trail conditions or due to requests of the managing agencies.\n\n\n"}

Originally recorded by Kelly Gordon in 1969, the song became a worldwide hit for The Hollies later that year and a minor hit for Neil Diamond in 1970. It has been recorded by many artists in subsequent years.\n\nScott and Russell were introduced to each other by Johnny Mercer, at a California nightclub. Although Russell was dying of lymphoma and the pair met only three times, they managed to collaborate on the song.\n\nJames Wells, Moderator of the United Free Church of Scotland, tells the story of a little girl carrying a big baby boy in his 1884 book \"The Parables of Jesus\". Seeing her struggling, someone asked if she wasn't tired. With surprise she replied: \"No, he's not heavy; he's my brother.\"\n\nIn a 1918 publication by Ralph Waldo Trine titled \"The Higher Powers of Mind and Spirit\", Trine relates the following anecdote: \"Do you know that incident in connection with the little Scottish girl? She was trudging along, carrying as best she could a boy younger, but it seemed almost as big as she herself, when one remarked to her how heavy he must be for her to carry, when instantly came the reply: 'He's na heavy. He's mi brither.'\"\n\nThe first editor of \"Kiwanis\" magazine, Roe Fulkerson, published a column in September 1924 carrying the title \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", the first use of the phrase exactly as it is rendered in the song title.\n\nIn the 1940s, the words, adapted as \"He ain't heavy, Father, he's my brother\", were taken as a slogan for Boys Town children's home by founder Father Edward Flanagan. According to the Boys Town website, the phrase as used by Boys Town was said to Fr. Flanagan in 1918 by one of the residents while carrying another up a set of stairs. The boy being carried is said to have had polio and worn leg braces.\n\nThe Hollies' recording, sung by Allan Clarke and featuring Elton John on piano, was released in the UK on 1 September 1969 and on 1 December 1969 in the US. It reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. The song, paired with their 1967 UK No. 3 hit \"Carrie Anne\", was re-released in late 1988 in the UK following its use in a television advertisement for Miller Lite beer. It reached the No. 1 spot in the UK chart for two weeks in September 1988.\n\n\n\nThe Neil Diamond version entered at #68 on the Hot 100 on 7 November 1970 (UNI Records, 55264, length 4:09). The flip side was \"Free Life\". The song appears on the Neil Diamond album \"Tap Root Manuscript\", which was released November 1970. The song was played by KGB-AM radio, San Diego, California, in late 1970, prior to the then-new Walk for Mankind, in dedication to those who would be walking for donations that day.\n\n7\" Single\n\n\nBill Medley recorded a version for the soundtrack of the film \"Rambo III\". It was released as a single in the UK and peaked at No. 25, being in the chart the same time as the Hollies' version in 1988. It reached No. 49 on the Billboard's AC chart.\n\n7\" Single\n\n\nIn 1996, Gotthard released their version of the song He Is not Heavy, He's My Brother, which is kept much more poppier compared to their other songs and the structure was retained as a ballad like the original. In Switzerland, the cover was just as successful as the original. The Asian version of the album G contains the cover. You can also find it in the compilations One Life One Soul - Best Of Ballads and The Greatest Rock Ballads.\n\nCD-Maxi\n\nIn 2012, a version of the song was recorded, and was released on 17 December 2012, by musicians and celebrities going under the name The Justice Collective, for various charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster.\n\nThe song went on to take the coveted Christmas number one position for 2012 on the UK Singles Chart, beating \"The X Factor\" winner James Arthur, who was number one the previous week.\n\nAfter the News International phone hacking scandal, members of The Farm along with Pete Wylie and Mick Jones of The Clash performed at an anti-\"The Sun\" concert at the Liverpool Olympia in September 2011. Following this they formed The Justice Tonight Band and toured the United Kingdom and Europe for the next year in order to raise awareness of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign.\n\nInitially, the idea was to re-release the 2009 single \"The Fields of Anfield Road\" by The Liverpool Collective featuring The Kop Choir; however, this idea was rejected by Peter Hooton as only a relatively small number of people would buy it. Inspired by Everton's Hillsborough tribute on 17 September 2012, the song was played at Goodison Park prior to their match against Newcastle United. It was then decided that a re-recording of this song by various artists including The Justice Tonight Band would be released as the charity single.\n\nKeith Mullen of The Farm recruited Guy Chambers to produce the single and with Chambers offering free use of his Sleeper Studios to record the song. On 25 October 2012, Steve Rotheram, Guy Chambers and Kenny Dalglish announced plans of the single to be recorded by various artists such as Robbie Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Paloma Faith, Beverley Knight, Melanie C, Holly Johnson, Mick Jones, Glen Campbell, Peter Hooton, Chris Sharrock, Glenn Tilbrook, Ren Harvieu, Dave McCabe, Paul Heaton, Hollie Cook, Jon McClure, John Power, Gerry Marsden, and two original members of The Hollies, Bobby Elliott and Tony Hicks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The reviewer describes Wolff's writing about his year in Vietnam as \"an elegant gallery of small sketches in which he is almost invariably the central figure...\" but praises his conveying \"for example, the altered sense of time and space that he and other American servicemen developed in Vietnam.\"\n\n\"The Independent\" noted: \"Even under fire, Wolff was self-consciously having an experience, giving himself something to write about one day. And quite a large part of what is only a small book is taken up with memories of the author's father, an ex-convict whose indisciplined life fostered in Wolff the desire for order.\"\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" noted that Wolff expressed \"a sense of futility and growing disillusionment with the war\" in his memoir. After being discharged, he was somewhat adrift, but the memoir extends through his four years of study of English literature at Oxford, a period when he committed to writing and \"found himself\".\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" called it \"an excellent volume\" that \"evenly weighs the many costs and few gains of coming of age in a war.\"\n"}

After the two oil crises (1973 and 1979) in the 1970s, construction investment turned sluggish, and the share of construction investment in GNP decreased gradually. In 1987, however, business expanded through investor confidence, continued increase in corporate earnings, improvement of personal income, and rapid rise in land prices. The share of construction investment in GNP rose sharply, especially for more sophisticated and higher value-added private housing and private non-housing structures (see table 19, Appendix). After employment peaking at 9.9% in 2003, the construction industry in Japan has entered a long, steady decline with workers share dropping to 7.0% by 2017. This decline is attributed to gradually slumping demand for the new houses. Japanese construction worker productivity have surpassed US productivity in 2006, but as in 2017, productivity of 0.24 houses/worker*year is still below peak value of 0.32 houses/worker*year in 1992. This downward trend (although less pronounced than in the US) is mostly attributed to the increasing median age of the construction workers. The productivity on concrete-making industry remains on the level along with the most productive countries, with the 1.29 man-hours per cubic meter reported in 2011 (with the leading US having 1.00 man-hours per cubic meter).\n\nConstruction starts in FY 1990 covered a total area of about 283 million square meters, with about 134 million square meters exclusively for housing. Total construction costs were estimated in excess of ¥49 trillion. \n\nAlthough demand for new private housing was expected to grow in the 1990s, even greater growth was expected for new urban office buildings. A number of large projects were under way, suggesting that the construction industry would experience continued growth throughout the 1990s. These include projects for Tokyo's waterfront and other urban redevelopment, highway construction, and new or expanded airports. The growth of Japanese construction industry was actually arrested by Lost Decade economic recession and did not recover fully as in 2017. \n\nJapan's construction technology, which includes advanced earthquake-resistant designs, is among the most developed in the world. Major firms compete to improve quality control over all phases of design, management, and execution. Research and development focuses especially on energy-related facilities, such as nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas (LNG) storage tanks. The largest firms are also improving their underwater construction methods. All of these methods underwent a deep review after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 and Sasago Tunnel collapse in 2012 has exposed a severe problems in work practices of Japanese construction companies.\n\n"}

It was through him that Herald was first exposed to live performances by blues and folk legends Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie. While at a summer camp in 1954, Herald was inspired by a performance by Pete Seeger. During his Manumit School days, he became a regular listener of Don Larkin's bluegrass radio show, and began attending open guitar jams with the likes of Bob Dylan and Rory Block.\n\nIn 1958, Herald formed The Greenbriar Boys, along with Bob Yellin (banjo) and Paul Prestopino (mandolin). The following year, Eric Weissberg (mandolin and fiddle), replaced Prestopino, and Weissberg was soon replaced by Ralph Rinzler (mandolin) to form their most successful combination. Herald was lead guitarist and vocalist. The trio often played the Greenwich Village scene, but were notable enough to be the first Northern group to win the likes of the Union Grove Fiddler's Convention competition, where Yellin also took top honors for banjo. Shortly after backing Joan Baez on her second LP, The Greenbriar Boys were signed to Vanguard Records, for whom they released three records. In 1969, Linda Ronstadt recorded Herald's \"High Muddy Water.\" Two years previously, she had recreated his vocal of Mike Nesmith's \"Different Drum,\" which became a hit for her band the Stone Poneys.\n\nAfter the trio split up, Herald played sessions for Vanguard. In 1972, he recorded an eponymous solo album for Paramount Records, then went \"electric country bluegrass\" on a 1978 disc featuring the John Herald Band (a group he'd formed while living in Philadelphia in 1976). Reviewing the solo album in \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This casually joyous solo debut by the former Greenbriar Boy gives in at times to such folky vices as mere flash, mere lyricism, and mere whimsy. But 'Fire Song,' a casually joyous ditty about how his house burned down, and 'Brother Sam,' unpresumptuous compassion for a returned Vietnam vet, should inspire Paul Simon to work real hard on the follow-up. And his high notes should inspire Art Garfunkel to go back to architecture school.\"\n\nHerald's last recording was \"Roll On John\" in 2000. He was working on new material in 2005 when, on July 19, his body was found in his home in West Hurley, New York.

He then continued his education to earn an LL.B. from the University of Kansas City, Missouri, in 1940. He was admitted to the Missouri Bar the same year and joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Special Agent on October 7, 1940. He served in field offices in Huntington, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Des Moines, Iowa; and the FBI Training Center in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nKelley served in the United States Navy from July 22, 1944, to April 9, 1946, having been granted military leave from the FBI.\n\nReturning from military service Kelley was assigned to the Kansas City office, where his performance earned him a promotion to field supervisor. He also served at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. in 1951. From July 1953 to July 1957, he served as Assistant Special Agent in Charge at the Houston, Seattle, and San Francisco offices. He was then transferred to the Training and Inspection Division at FBI Headquarters, becoming an Inspector. In December 1957, he was promoted to Special Agent in Charge of the Birmingham office and was reassigned to the Memphis office in November 1960, where he served as Special Agent in Charge until his retirement from the FBI on October 24, 1961.\n\nAfter retiring from the FBI Kelley was the Chief of Police in Kansas City, Missouri. During that time, he was a member and officer of several civic associations. He is acknowledged and respected as an innovator who created the first helicopter division and installed the first computer systems in the Kansas City Police Department.\n\nIn 1970 Kelley received the J.

The United States Senate confirmed the nomination June 27 and he was sworn in on July 9. Kelley was the first Director of the FBI to be appointed through the nomination and confirmation process. During his time as Director, Kelley is known for eliminating the embezzlement practices that had been prevalent in the administrative division under J. Edgar Hoover's directorship through his cooperation with a Justice Department investigation. Kelley also reopened relations with other intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency which had nearly been shut down by Hoover in his last years as director.\n\nKelley helped the FBI transition from its 40 plus years of being dominated by a single director, J. Edgar Hoover, by improving the public image of the FBI as an organization in change albeit without making the change forceful enough to FBI agents who had been loyal to Hoover. Kelley announced his intention to retire in 1977, prompting an exhaustive year-long search for a successor. President Jimmy Carter finally decided on William H. Webster, who was nominated in January 1978.\n\nKelley retired from the FBI February 15, 1978 and was temporarily succeeded by James B.

The restaurant was originally located at 144 Taylor Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood, and initially consisted of a 14-stool counter on a saw-dust covered floor. As business grew, Rocca and Rodin leased a vacant space next to them, which allowed the addition of a full dining room. Later, more space became available next to the dining room enabling the addition of a full bar, which resulted in its final size.

The son of a priest (of Liessau), he studied (after 1783) mathematics and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, where Christian Jakob Kraus, Johann Schultz, and Immanuel Kant were his teachers. After his studies he first accepted a post as a teacher at a grammar school in Halle. With his thesis \"Dissertatio de Theoremate Tayloriano, sive de lege generali, secundum quam functionis mutantur, notatis a quibus pendent variabilibus\", which he wrote in Halle, he was qualified as a university lecturer. He then worked as a lecturer of philosophy at the University of Halle (1791–1799), before be became a professor of philosophy at the University of Rostock. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation of the doctrine of Kant, and in 1793 published the \"Erläuternder Auszug aus den kritischen Schriften des Herrn Prof. Kant, auf Anrathen desselben\" (Riga, 1793–1796), which has been widely used as a compendium of Kantian doctrine.\n\nBeck endeavoured to explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in Kant's system by saying that much of the language is used in a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, e.g. where Kant attributes to things-in-themselves an existence under the conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that the real meaning of Kant's theory is idealism; that knowledge of objects outside the domain of consciousness is impossible, and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the subjective element. Matter is deduced by the original synthesis. Similarly, the idea of God is a symbolic representation of the voice of conscience guiding from within. The value of Beck's exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to the greater attention given to the work of J. G. Fichte. Beside the three volumes of the \"Erläuternder Auszug\", he published the \"Grundriss der kritischen Philosophie\" (1796), containing an interpretation of the Kantian \"Kritik\" in the manner of Salomon Maimon.\n\nBeck died in Rostock.\n\n"}

Despite losing the tournament, Luke faced Supreme in a Bed of Light Tubes and Barbed Wire match at the Fallout event on October 5 and defeated him to win the King of the Deathmatch Title. On December 21 at the Merry F'n X-Mas event, Luke re-lost the title to Supreme in a House of Horrors Match.\n\nOn May 24, 2008 at XPW's reunion event, Cold Day In Hell, Hawx defeated Jack Evans and Scorpio Sky in a three-way match. On August 22, 2009 at XPW's 10 Year Anniversary show, Hawx and Sky defeated Matt Cross and Tool in a tag team match.\n\nWhen XPW folded in early 2003, Hawxhurst changed his ring name to Luke Hawx and also adopted a more traditional ring attire before resuming work on the independent circuit for various promotions, including Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Ring of Honor, Combat Zone Wrestling, and NWA Wildside.\n\nOn the November 11, 2006 taping of MTV's Wrestling Society X, Hawx debuted for the show in a losing effort to Human Tornado. At the taping the next day, Hawx teamed with Al Katrazz in a winning effort against Kaos and Aaron Aguilera in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. On the November 14 taping, Hawx and Katrazz won again after defeating Keep It Gangsta (Ruckus and Babi Slymm) before losing to The Trailer Park Boys (Nate Webb and Josh Raymond). On the February 13, 2007 episode of WSX, Hawx and Katrazz defeated Kaos and Aguilera in a TLC rematch. WSX folded shortly afterwards.\n\nOn August 4, 2012 in Orlando, Florida, Hawxhurst defeated Jesse Neal to win the Continental Wrestling Federation Championship.\n\nSince his days in Extreme Rising, Hawx started a feud against Matt Hardy. On July 19, 2014 at Maryland Championship Wrestling's Shane Shamrock Cup, Hawx and Hardy wrestled in a TLC match for Hardys MCW Heavweight Championship and Hawx Extreme Rising World Championship (which Hawx had the physical belt). However, Hardy won the match. After the match, Hardy gave back the belt to Hawx.\n\nIn 2016, Hawx was a 2-time World Heavyweight Champion in World Association of Wrestling, a British Wrestling organisation run by the family of WWE Women's wrestler Paige. He first won the title by defeating Zak Knight on May 14, only to lose it to Mr. Anderson on September 16th. Hawk regained the title the very next night in a rematch, holding it for another 91 days before losing it to Brad Slayer.\n\nIn early 2012, Shane Douglas announced the foundation of the Extreme Rising promotion, with its inaugural event, Extreme Reunion, to be held on April 28, 2012. At the event, Hawx made his debut for the promotion as a heel by venting his frustrations about Douglas and the reunion show itself before he was escorted from the building by security. He later returned to distract Stevie Richards in the event's opening match, which ultimately cost The Blue World Order their tag team match against The Full Blooded Italians. On June 29, Hawk was able to defeat Richards in an \"Extreme Respect\" match following assistance from Sylvester Terkay. The following night, Richards defeated Hawx in a rematch, but was attacked by Hawx after the match. Hawx took the mic and once again called out Douglas before being forced to the back security. Hawx then competed at Extreme Rising's first iPPV event Remember November, entering the Extreme Rising World Championship Tournament. He defeating Perry Saturn by submission in the first round and later interfered in the main event, where he legitimately injured Matt Hardy during Hardy's match against Shane Douglas. On March 1, 2014, Hawx defeated Extreme Rising World Champion Stevie Richards in a non-title match at an ECWA event, following interference from \"The Greek God\" Papadon. Afterwards, Hawx took possession of the title belt and declared himself the new champion, leading to Extreme Rising demanding him to return the belt, while announcing that he had earned himself a championship match on April 26. However, Hawx didn't give back the belt.\n\nOn the September 1, 2003, Hawxhurst, reusing his Altar Boy Luke gimmick, made his World Wrestling Entertainment debut as he teamed with Mortis and defeated Big Bad Jon and Travis Tomko in a tag team dark match before the taping of \"SmackDown!\".\n\nOn July 10, 2007, Hawxhurst received another WWE tryout match and lost to Chuck Palumbo at the \"SmackDown!\" taping in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. On the March 21, 2008 episode of \"SmackDown\", Hawx, along with Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas, faced and lost against The Big Show in a 3-on-1 handicap match. On the June 9, 2009 episode of \"ECW\", Hawxhurst, as Luke Hawx, teamed with Kris Lewie in a losing effort to Vladimir Kozlov in a handicap match. On the February 9, 2010 episode of \"ECW\", Hawxhurst, under the ring name Perry Wallace, lost to Ezekiel Jackson.\n\n\nIn June 2011, Hawxhurst and fellow professional wrestler Orlando Jordan founded WildKat Sports & Entertainment, a professional wrestling school located in Hawxhurst's hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The school is also home to WILDKAT, which was formerly known as NWA WildKat during its 10-month-long stint as a National Wrestling Alliance territory.\nThe promotion is home to many local independent wrestlers, including: Bu Ku Dao, Danny Flamingo, J Spade, Matt Lancie, Curt Matthews, Jared Wayne, Scott Phoenix, Jace Valor, Nathan Bradley, Reginald Gates, Steve Anthony, Stevie Richards, and Hawx himself.\n\n\n"}

With increasing activism by tribal nations since the mid-20th century to obtain federal recognition of their tribal sovereignty, many states have passed legislation to recognize some tribes and acknowledge the self-determination and continuity of historic ethnic groups. The majority of these groups are located in the Eastern US, including the three largest state-recognized tribes in the US, viz. the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, the Miami Nation of Indiana and the United Houma Nation of Louisiana, each of which has several thousand tribal members.\n\nIn many cases, they have recognized tribes that were landless; that is, did not have an Indian reservation or communal land holdings. In addition, such states have often established commissions or other administrative bodies to deal with Native American affairs within the state. It has resulted from the process of increasing self-determination and preservation of cultural identity within some Native American communities, including descendants who remained in states east of the Mississippi River when many tribes were removed during the 19th century.\n\nState recognition confers limited benefits under federal law. It is not the same as federal recognition, which is the federal government's acknowledgment of a tribe as a dependent sovereign nation. Some states have provided laws related to state recognition that provide some protection of autonomy for tribes not recognized by the federal government. For example, in Connecticut, state law recognizing certain tribes also protects reservations and limited self-government rights for state-recognized tribes.\n\nSuch state recognition has at times been opposed by federally recognized tribes. For instance, the Cherokee Nation opposes state-recognized tribes claiming Cherokee identity, as well as many non-recognized groups that also claim to be Cherokee.\n\nNumerous other groups assert that they are Indian tribes. Many are listed in list of unrecognized tribes in the United States.\n\nThe United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, gives ultimate authority with regard to matters affecting the Indian tribes to the United States. Under federal law and regulations, an Indian tribe is a group of Native Americans with self-government authority. This defines those tribes recognized by the federal government.\n\nBy late 2007, about 16 states had recognized 62 tribes. Five other states—Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, and Oklahoma—had less developed processes of recognition. Typically, the state legislature or state agencies involved in cultural or Native American affairs make the formal recognition by criteria they establish, often with Native American representatives, and sometimes based on federal criteria. Members of a state-recognized tribe are still subject to state law and government, and the tribe does not have sovereign control over its affairs. While some state-recognized tribes have petitioned unsuccessfully for federal recognition only the Virginian Palmunky tribe has been successful. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, only 14 states recognize tribes at the state level.\n\nUnder the United States Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, members of state-recognized tribes are authorized to exhibit as identified Native American artists, as are members of federally recognized tribes.\n\nKoenig and Stein have recommended the processes of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, all established by laws passed by the state legislatures, as models worthy of other states to use as the basis for legislation related to recognition of Native American tribes. Statutes that clearly identify criteria for recognition or that explicitly recognize certain tribes remove ambiguity from their status.\n\nBy 2008 a total of 62 Native American tribes had been recognized by states; by 2018, 573 had been recognized by the federal government, often as a result of the process of treaties setting up reservations in the 19th century.\n\nThe following is a list of tribes recognized by various states, but not by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Tribes originally recognized by states that have since gained federal recognition have been deleted from the list below. The list identifies those state-recognized tribes that have petitioned for federal recognition and been denied. Many continue to work to gain such recognition.\n\nBy the Davis-Strong Act of 1984, the state established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission to acknowledge and represent Native American citizens in the state. At that time, it recognized seven tribes that did not have federal recognition. The commission members, representatives of the tribes, have created rules for tribal recognition, which were last updated in 2003, under which three more tribes have been recognized.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the state legislature formally recognized as American Indian tribes of Georgia the following:\n\n\n\nOn January 9, 2012, for the first time the state recognized two American Indian tribes under a process developed by the General Assembly; these were both Piscataway groups, historically part of the large Algonquian languages family along the Atlantic Coast. The Governor announced it to the Assembly by executive order.\n\n\nThe Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs was created by a legislative act of the General Court of Massachusetts in 1974, with the purpose of helping tribes recognized or that will be recognized receive access to and assistance with various local and state agencies. Two former state-recognized tribes, the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, have federal recognition as of 1987 and 2007, respectively.\n\n\nAs of 2014, Michigan has four State-recognized tribes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina recognizes three types of Native American entities; tribes, groups and special interest organizations. the state recognizes nine Native American tribes that are not recognized by the federal government.\n\nIn Texas, there are three Tribes that are recognized by both Federal and Texas governments. Texas recognizes two additional Tribes:\n\nAs of May 3, 2006, Vermont law 1 V.S.A §§ 851–853 recognizes Abenakis as Native American Indians, \"not the tribes or bands\". However, on April 22, 2011, Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin signed legislative bills officially recognizing two Abenaki Bands. The four Abenaki state-recognized tribes are also known as the \"Abenaki Alliance.\"\n\nOn May 7, 2012, Governor Shumlim signed legislative bills officially recognizing two more Abenaki Bands: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) format. The transmitter is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at () and its studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd.\n\nWIOQ broadcasts using HD Radio, with its HD1 channel airing the analog Top 40 programming, the HD2 subchannel airing Russian language \"DaNu Radio\" and the HD3 subchannel airing iHeart's Pride Radio national format with some local programming as well.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission granted WFIL Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new FM station on February 4, 1941. The station signed on for the first time with the call sign W53PH on February 10, 1942, broadcasting at 45.3 MHz on the original FM band, which covered 42 to 50 MHz. The station mostly simulcast the programming of its AM sister station 560 WFIL. The FCC granted the station its first license on September 9, 1942. On November 1, 1943, the station was assigned the WFIL-FM call sign. After the FCC created the current FM band on June 27, 1945, the FCC granted temporary authority for operation on 99.9 MHz beginning on December 29, 1945.\n\nThe station's license was voluntarily assigned to Triangle Publications, Inc., The Philadelphia Inquirer Division, effective March 1, 1946. The FCC issued a construction permit on June 10, 1946 for permanent operation on 99.9 MHz. However, on June 27, 1947, the FCC reallocated the station to 102.1 MHz and authorized temporary operation on the new frequency. On February 5, 1948, the FCC granted Triangle Publications permission for the station to cease broadcasting on 45.3 MHz. A new construction permit was issued by the FCC for permanent operation on 102.1 MHz on September 29, 1948, followed by a new license on January 4, 1950.\n\nOn July 10, 1968, WFIL-FM switched away from classical music to an early version of a soft adult contemporary format. Known as \"Popular 102,\" the station featured softer pop music of the day with a mix of currents, oldies and instrumentals. Each hour included a track from a featured album of the week, and voices on the station were pre-recorded announcements and news from the staff at sister station WFIL, including Jay Cook, J.J. Jeffrey, Tommy Tyler and news from Allen Stone and Glenn Barton. \n\nThe station promoted itself as playing \"The Nicest Music for the Nicest People.\" This format continued through May 1971, when Triangle Publications decided to sell its Philadelphia broadcasting stations.\n\nIn 1971, Triangle Publications sold WFIL-AM-FM-TV to Capital Cities Broadcasting (later Capital Cities Communications). In turn, WFIL-FM 102.1 was spun off to Richer Communications in May 1971. The call letters were changed to WIOQ representing the script version of IOQ in relation to the frequency of 102. The familiar jingle of Popular 102 was also changed to W102. Initially, the familiar PAMS jingles were updated to reflect the new call letters and the station continued as before. By 1972, the station's imaging changed to Stereo Island which trended even softer than the station had been, but added live DJs while the music rotated on an IGM automation unit. \n\nAir staff at this time included Jeff Dean, Lee Meredith, Art Andrews, Alan Drew (Frio), Jere Sullivan, and Jay Mathieu, with Dave Klahr continuing as program director. After a year or so in this format, the station brought back the \"Popular 102\" moniker and started playing a slightly more uptempo mix of pop tunes. When Dave Klahr left, Roy Laurence was hired as program director and the station's mix, which by then had become Top 40-based with a more adult presentation than its former AM sister, gradually became more rock-oriented, and by about 1975 WIOQ had a progressive rock format. Around this time the station began using an extract from the album \"Intergalactic Trot\" by Stardrive as the music bed for hourly station IDs. It would remain WIOQ's audio signature for over a decade.\n\nThe station also started using the moniker \"Q102\" during that time. For a time in the mid-'70s, the station affiliated with ABC's \"American FM Radio Network\" in order to air some programs hosted by then-hip Geraldo Rivera. That contract also forced the station to air the network's ABC news at :15 past the hour, as its competition was playing music. The station had trouble competing with established FM rock leader WMMR and aggressive AOR upstart WYSP. Programming duties were split between Alex DeMers and Bill Fantini, with DJs Jim Harlan, John Harvey, and Bill Paul rounding out the full-time air staff. After a few years, the owner (by then listed as Que Broadcasting, Inc.) declared bankruptcy. WIOQ emerged from the bankruptcy under the ownership of The Outlet Company, a retail and broadcasting firm based in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nUnder Outlet, WIOQ evolved into an eclectic music format often described as \"adult rock\". The station played a blend of softer songs heard on rock music stations, some deeper album cuts, a few top 40 crossover hits, and a bit of uptempo jazz. Leading air personalities on WIOQ in this era included John Harvey (\"Harvey in the Morning\"), Helen Leicht who hosted a show called \"Breakfast With The Beatles\" on Sunday mornings, David Dye, Ed Sciaky and Michael Tozzi. (Leicht and Dye are now the midday DJs for the adult alternative public station WXPN. The former continues her \"Leight Lunch\" program at noon, and Dye is the producer and host of the nationally distributed World Cafe.) After a proposed sale of Outlet's broadcast properties to Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures subsidiary around 1982 fell through, the station group was acquired by Wesray Capital Corporation, a corporation partially owned by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon.\n\nAfter years of low to moderate ratings, on November 10, 1987, at 6 a.m., adult rock was dropped in favor of an oldies format, playing the hits of 1955-1973 and positioning the station as \"Solid Gold 102\". Harvey Holiday, formerly of WDAS-FM, hosted the station's morning show.\n\nLate in 1988, WIOQ was sold to EZ Communications. On January 18, 1989, at 7:18 a.m., the station dropped oldies and switched to a Rhythmic/Dance-leaning Top 40 format, branded as \"Q102.\" The first song under the new format was \"Let's Go Crazy\" by Prince and The Revolution. \n\nThe station consistently leaned toward dance and urban material, but played varying amounts of rock and AC crossover songs, changing according to chart trends and competitive conditions. In 1994, urban rival WUSL was bought by EZ, forming a sales and demographic combo where WUSL targeted African-American listeners, while WIOQ targeted more of a Caucasian and Latino audience. In 1996, EZ merged with American Radio Systems. To satisfy ownership limits (as well as taking advantage of a larger advertising market), WIOQ and WUSL were traded to Evergreen Media (owner of WJJZ), with EZ receiving Evergreen's Charlotte stations in return. In February 1997, Evergreen and Chancellor Media merged. After the Chancellor acquisition, WIOQ became co-owned with 104.5 FM (now WRFF), WDAS, WDAS-FM, WUSL, and WJJZ (now WISX).\n\nBy early 1998, the station evolved to Mainstream CHR with a slight dance and rhythmic lean. There were a few rumors that Q102 would adopt a rhythmic oldies format in 1999, along with reports that WDAS-FM would possibly become one as well, but neither happened, as WXXM (now WBEN-FM) flipped to the format in May of that year.\n\nAs a result of a large merger in 2000, WIOQ and the other stations in its cluster became properties of Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia).

It was founded in 1997 and began developing and licensing semiconductor intellectual property cores that implemented the MIPS I architecture, except for the four unaligned load and store (lwl, lwr, swl, swr) instructions.\n\nLexra did not implement those instructions because they are not necessary for good performance in modern software and Silicon Graphics owned a patent that had originally been granted to MIPS Computer Systems Inc. for implementing unaligned loads and stores in a RISC processor and Lexra did not wish to pay a high license fee for permission to use the patent.\n\nLexra licensed soft cores unlike ARM Ltd at the time. Lexra was probably the first semiconductor intellectual property core company to do so.\n\nIn 1998 Silicon Graphics spun out MIPS Technologies Inc. as a semiconductor IP licensing company that would compete directly with Lexra. MIPS Technologies sued Lexra claiming a trademark infringement for Lexra's claims of compatibility with the MIPS I. Lexra and MIPS Technologies settled the dispute by agreeing that in all public statements Lexra would clearly state that it did not implement unaligned loads and stores.\n\nIn 1999 MIPS Technologies sued Lexra again, but this time for infringing its patents on unaligned loads and stores. Though Lexra's processor designs did not implement unaligned loads and stores, it was possible to emulate the functionality of unaligned loads and stores through a long series of other instructions. In the opinion of Lexra, the ability to emulate the function of unaligned loads and stores in software predated the grant of the patent in question and could not be viewed as an infringement of the hardware patent by any reasonable interpretation. Also, much earlier than any MIPS Technologies processor, IBM mainframes supported unaligned memory operations. In these earlier IBM processors, unaligned memory operations and partial access to registers were available through microcode and the instruction set architecture. These aspects of earlier IBM processors posed the much greater threat of patent invalidation to MIPS Technologies, compared to the seemingly vacuous MIPS Technologies infringement claim against Lexra.\n\nThe protracted second lawsuit combined with a downturn in semiconductor industry business forced Lexra into a settlement with MIPS Technologies that included MIPS Technologies paying Lexra a large sum of money and granting Lexra a license to its technologies in exchange for Lexra exiting the IP business.\n\nLexra failed as a networking / communications fabless semiconductor chip company and ceased operations in January 2003.\n\nIn its 5.5 years, Lexra implemented ten processor designs and licensed nine of them as IP cores.

They are fishing nets that are fixed land installations for fishing. While commonly known as \"Chinese fishing nets\" in India, the more formal name for such nets is \"shore operated lift nets\". Huge mechanical contrivances hold out horizontal nets of 20 m or more across. Each structure is at least 10 m high and comprises a cantilever with an outstretched net suspended over the sea and large stones suspended from ropes as counterweights at the other end. Each installation is operated by a team of up to six fishermen. While such nets are used throughout coastal southern China and Indochina, in India they are mostly found in the Indian cities of Kochi and Kollam, where they have become a tourist attraction. This way of fishing is unusual in India and almost unique to the area, as it was introduced by Chinese explorers who landed there in the 14th century. Indeed, one interpretation of the city name Kochi is ‘co-chin', meaning ‘like China.’\n\nThe system is sufficiently balanced that the weight of a man walking along the main beam is sufficient to cause the net to descend into the sea. The net is left for a short time, possibly just a few minutes, before it is raised by pulling on ropes. The catch is usually modest: a few fish and crustaceans, which may be sold to passers-by within minutes.\n\nRocks, each 30 cm or so in diameter, are suspended from ropes of different lengths. As the net is raised, some of the rocks one-by-one come to rest on a platform thereby keeping everything in balance.\n\nEach installation has a limited operating depth. Consequently, an individual net cannot be continually operated in tidal waters. Different installations will be operated depending on the state of the tide.\n\nThe nets may have been introduced by the Chinese explorer Zheng He.\n\nThe Chinese fishing nets have become a very popular tourist attraction. Their size and elegant construction is photogenic and the slow rhythm of their operation is quite hypnotic. In addition, catches can be purchased individually and need be taken only a short distance to a street entrepreneur who will cook it.\n\n\n"}

His book \"The American Occupational Structure\", which received the American Sociological Association's Sorokin Award, documented how parents transmit their societal status to their children. Duncan compiled his thoughts on the major issues of the field into \"Notes on Social Measurement\", which he considered his greatest work.\n\nOne of the most influential sociologists in history, Otis Dudley Duncan was instrumental in transforming mainstream American sociology into a quantitatively based empirical social science in the second half of the twentieth century. His key scholarly contributions include the introduction of path analysis to sociology; the measurement of occupational socioeconomic standing with an index (Duncan Socioeconomic Index); the study of intergenerational occupational mobility; the spatial analysis of residential patterns; the application and advancement of log-linear models and Rasch models for categorical social science data; and a landmark treatise on social measurement (Duncan 1984).\n\nDuncan’s best known work is a 1967 book that he coauthored with Peter Blau, \"The American Occupational Structure\". Based on quantitative analyses of the first large national survey of social mobility in the United States, the book elegantly depicts the process by which parents transmit their social standing to their children, particularly through affecting the children’s education. The book’s impact went far beyond its analyses of occupational mobility. Using survey data and statistical techniques, it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate quantitative methods. The work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology. Today a worldwide community of sociologists specializing in social stratification and social mobility still work on elaborating the Blau-Duncan model to include such additional factors as cognitive ability, race, and social context in studying the transmission of social standing from one generation to the next.\n\nDuncan retired in 1987, taking up pursuits such as composing electronic music and computer graphics. In 2000 he joined his local Humanist Society which led him to publish new work on the prevalence of creationism, tolerance of atheists, support for euthanasia and other such issues.\n\nDuncan, O.
