At the time large parts of the Australian coast were unmapped and Britain had claimed only part of the continent. The British Government were concerned that, in the event of settlers of another European power becoming established in Australia, any future conflict in Europe would lead to a widening of the conflict into the southern hemisphere to the detriment of the trade that Britain sought to develop. It was against this background that \"Lady Nelson\" was chosen to survey and establish sovereignty over strategic parts of the continent.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" left Portsmouth on 18 March 1800 and arrived at Sydney on 16 December 1800 after having been the first vessel to reach the east coast of Australia via Bass Strait. Prior to that date all vessels had sailed around the southern tip of Tasmania to reach their destination.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\"s survey work commenced shortly after her arrival at Sydney, initially in the Bass Strait area. She was involved in the discovery of Port Phillip, on the coast of Victoria, in establishing settlements on the River Derwent and at Port Dalrymple in Tasmania, at Newcastle and Port Macquarie in New South Wales, and on Melville Island off the north coast of the continent.\n\nAt the end of the 1790s the New South Wales Colonial Government had no vessels capable of reaching the outside world. \"Supply\" (1793) was found to be unseaworthy in 1797 and was subsequently condemned. was also unseaworthy. \"Reliance\" was temporarily repaired to enable her to sail back to England, whither she departed in March 1800. The only other vessel under the control of the colonial government was , a schooner of only 44 tons (bm). The situation was partially relieved when arrived in May 1799, but the colony possessed no vessels for exploration and surveying.\n\nIn 1799 the Admiralty's Commissioners of Transport (the Transport Board), ordered a cutter of 60 tons (bm), to be built for their own use in the River Thames and called it \"Lady Nelson\". Her design followed that of the armed cutter \"Trial\", built in Plymouth in 1789 to a design developed by Captain (later Admiral) John Schanck [often spelled Schank]. \"Trial\" was unusual in that she had three sliding keels, or centre-boards, that the crew could raise or lower individually.\n\nAt the time there were several other vessels named \"Lady Nelson\" and this has led some authors to write that the vessel, which is the subject of this article, was employed on other duties before being sent to Australia.\n\nPhilip Gidley King, who was in England in 1799, was aware of the lack of vessels in New South Wales, and lobbied for \"Lady Nelson\" to be taken over for use in the Colony. The cost to the government was said to be £890. He personally inspected the vessel on 8 October 1799, whilst it was being fitted-out at Deptford, and suggested that:as few seamen know anything about the management of a cutter, her being constructed into a brig would make her more manageable to the generality of seamen. Schanck agreed with this change and the Commissioners of Transport were directed to rig the vessel as a brig, and not as a cutter like the \"Trial\" as had been intended.\n\nThe ability to raise the keels was a useful feature for a survey vessel required to work in shallow waters. \"Lady Nelson\"s draught was 12 feet when she left England, fully provisioned for her voyage. This would draught would halve to six feet when the keels were raised. The keels were of timber construction with no added ballast.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was built by John Dudman in the dockyard, known as Deadman's Dock, at Grove Street, Deptford. \"Lady Nelson\"s first commander was Lieutenant James Grant, the commission of whom came into effect on 19 October 1799. \"Lady Nelson\" was commissioned:for the purpose of prosecuting the discovery and survey of the unknown parts of the coast of New Holland, and ascertaining, as far as is practicable, the hydrography of that part of the globe. \n\nPhilip Gidley King departed for New South Wales in \"Speedy\" on 26 Nov 1799 with a despatch recalling the incumbent Governor, John Hunter, who returned to England. King then took over as Governor and subsequently played a key part in the affairs of \"Lady Nelson\" after she arrived.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was loaded with sufficient provisions for nine months and enough water for six months, at an allowance of one gallon for each man per day. She was not equipped with a chronometer.\n\nThe beginning of the voyage to Australia was recorded by Grant: On 13 January 1800, the \"Lady Nelson\" hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the River, having her complement of men, stores, and provisions on board. \"Lady Nelson\" reached Gravesend on 16 January, anchored in the Downs on 20 January 1800. After riding out a heavy gale Grant decided to seek shelter in Ramsgate Harbour. \"Lady Nelson\" remained there until 7 February, when she sailed for Portsmouth to await a convoy to escort her past the French and Spanish coasts.\n\nWhilst at Portsmouth \"Lady Nelson\"s armament, consisting of two brass carriage guns, was increased to six. On 15 March 1800, Captain Schanck, accompanied by Mr. Bayley, of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, paid Grant a visit.\n\nMany people who saw \"Lady Nelson\" did not consider her suitable to undertake such a long voyage and this caused Grant some difficulty in keeping his crew together and finding replacements for those that deserted. The carpenter, who had deserted when leaving Portsmouth, and one other member of the crew were not replaced and one man was put ashore due to illness. When \"Lady Nelson\" sailed her complement was probably therefore only three officers and ten crew.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" departed from Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at 6 pm on 18 March.The convoy consisted of East Indiamen, heading for the East, and , which was also bound for New South Wales.\n\nShortly after departure it became apparent that \"Lady Nelson\" could not keep up with the larger and faster vessels in the convoy. \"Brunswick\" therefore took \"Lady Nelson\" in tow, but Grant became concerned that the vessel might be strained too much in the heavy seas and therefore, after a couple of days, ordered the hawser to be cast off, preferring to continue the voyage alone.\n\nOn 13 April \"Lady Nelson\" anchored at Port Praya (Praia), on the island of 'St Jago' (Ilha de Santiago), the largest of the Cape Verde Islands, 26 days after leaving Portsmouth. Whilst there, the keels were inspected and it was found that part of the after keel had broken off, which may have occurred during earlier heavy weather. The missing part of the keel was replaced, a task not made any easier by the lack of a carpenter on board. Before leaving, Grant put his second mate ashore for sowing seeds of discontent amongst the crew, and obtained the Governor's permission to take two young men from the island to supplement his crew. \"Lady Nelson\" left Praia on 27 April. The vessel's complement was now three officers and twelve crew.\n\nOn 23 May, the weather being fine, \"Lady Nelson\"s keels were examined and it was found that the piece that had been fitted to the bottom of the after keel at Praia had broken off. A temporary repair was effected by pushing the keel deeper into the well, and securing it with a plank of wood.\n\nLand was sighted near Table Bay at 5 am on 7 June and \"Lady Nelson\" anchored there at 5 pm on 8 June 1800. A shipbuilder from the naval dockyard examined \"Lady Nelson\" and as her main and after keels were both found to be beyond repair they were replaced with new ones. \"Lady Nelson\" had been troubled by leaks in her topsides since she left England. This was also investigated whilst the vessel was at the Cape, and it was found 'that instead of the seams being filled with oakum they had absolutely substituted putty'.\n\nTwo new keels having been fitted, \"Lady Nelson\" left Table Bay on 16 June and anchored in Simon's Bay the next day. Already anchored there was \"Porpoise\", which had left Portsmouth in the same convoy as \"Lady Nelson\".\n\nGrant's orders were 'to remain at the Cape till the summer season commenced' so as not to risk his small vessel in the Roaring Forties during the southern hemisphere winter. Grant therefore spent many weeks at the Cape and the observations he made during the period are recorded in his book (Grant 1803).\n\nWhilst at the Cape, Grant received a despatch from London in which he was advised that a navigable strait had recently been discovered between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), in latitude 38° south, and the despatch instructed him to: sail through the said strait on your way to Port Jackson, by which means you will not only shorten your voyage, but will have an opportunity of more minutely surveying the said strait. \n\nBefore leaving the Cape, Grant took on board a carpenter and a person named Dr. Brandt. Grant also consented to take on board a Danish seaman, thought to be Jorgen Jorgenson, sentenced at the Cape to transportation, for his involvement in mutinous behaviour on board a recently arrived ship. \"Lady Nelson\" left the Cape on 7 October 1800.\n\nThe south coast of what was then called New Holland was not sighted until \"Lady Nelson\" approached the land near the present border between South Australia and Victoria.\n\nGrant recorded first sighting the mainland on 3 December 1800:At 8.00 am I saw the land from the north training as far to the east as east-north-east. The part that was right ahead appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number, distant six or seven leagues. At noon I observed, being in with the land, our latitude to be 38° 10' S. longitude, by account, 142° 30' E. which according to my best judgement, after looking over my reckoning, I allowed the western point of land Cape Banks to lay in 142° E. From the distance I was from the shore, and observing in 38° 10', I make Cape Banks to lie in 38° 4' S.\n\nGrant observed two capes and two high mountains a considerable way inshore. Grant named the first of these mountains after Captain Schanck (since renamed Mount Schank), and the other Gambier's Mountain. The western cape he called Cape Banks and the second, eastern cape, he called Cape Northumberland. The actual position of Cape Banks is longitude . The discrepancy in longitude would have resulted, at least in part, by the absence of a chronometer on \"Lady Nelson\".\n\nDuring the succeeding days, as \"Lady Nelson\" approached Bass Strait, Grant made numerous observations and named several geographic features along the southern coast of the continent.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" entered Bass Strait itself on 7 December when Grant sighted a cape that he named Cape Albany Otway (now Cape Otway). He named another cape, eight or ten nautical miles East-North-East-half East, Patton's Cape (now Cape Patton). A large bay, now appearing to the east, he named Portland Bay.\n\nOn 8 December \"Lady Nelson\" sailed across a large bay, which was found to extend from Cape Otway in the west to Wilsons Promontory in the east, a distance of 120 nautical miles. Grant named this large extent of water Governor King's Bay, but the name has not survived. The discovery of Port Phillip, at the head of this bay, the bottom of which could not be seen from the mast-head, was still many months into the future.\n\nAs the coast between Wilsons Promontory and Port Jackson had already examined by Bass and Flinders, Grant did not conduct any further surveys and headed for Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove at 7.30 pm on 16 December 1800 after a voyage of 71 days from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe agreements entered into between the Transport Board and the crew of \"Lady Nelson\" terminated on arrival of the vessel in Port Jackson and accordingly the crew were paid off. King had not received any directions on whether the vessel was to be considered on the establishment of the Navy, the Transport Board, or the Colony, and it was many months before this administrative matter was resolved.\n\nBefore Grant left England he had received an appointment as Lieutenant to , which was to come into effect on his arrival at Port Jackson, but when he arrived he found \"Supply\" had been condemned as unfit to proceed to sea. Grant: 'was therefore, to make use of a sailor's phrase, completely adrift.'\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" carried despatches to the Governor of New South Wales that included instructions on her future deployment. The instructions indicated that 'The survey of the southern or south-western coast of the country appears to be of the most immediate importance'. The Governor, now Philip Gidley King, therefore had to find a commander and a new crew to carry out these instructions.\n\nAs there was no other naval officer in the colony, command of \"Lady Nelson\" was offered to Grant (then unemployed), which he accepted. John Murray, Second Mate of \"Porpoise\", transferred to \"Lady Nelson\" as First Mate.\n\nAs the crew could only be given naval pay, and not the very high wages paid by the Transport Board during the delivery voyage, only two of the crew that had sailed \"Lady Nelson\" from England were prepared re-join the vessel. King therefore had to recruit a convict crew. This he did by granting conditional emancipations to some of the best behaved of the seamen among the convicts to enable them to serve on board the vessel and to receive the pay given in the Navy.\n\nThe naval complement of the vessel was therefore:\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was provisioned for a six-month voyage and Grant received orders to return to Bass Strait with detailed instructions to carry out a survey of those parts not examined during the passage from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nFour Privates of the New South Wales Corps were placed on board as a guard and Ensign Francis Barrallier, also of the New South Wales Corps, joined as surveyor for the expedition. The expedition was joined by George Caley, a botanist sent by Sir Joseph Banks to collect plants, John Lewin, naturalist and artist, and an aborigine named Euranabie and his wife WoroganThe \"Lady Nelson\" was to be accompanied by the sloop \"Bee\" to act as a tender.\n\nThe two vessels left Sydney Cove on 6 March 1801 but encountered heavy weather soon after their departure. \"Bee\" shipped a lot of water and was obliged to return to Port Jackson. \"Lady Nelson\" continued south alone and, after spending two days in Jervis Bay, passed Cape Howe on the 15th, Wilsons Promontory on the 20th, and sighted Western Port on 21 March. \"Lady Nelson\" had arrived off the island that forms the south head of Western Port and from its likeness to a snapper's head, Grant named it Snapper Island, since renamed Phillip Island.\n\nThe greater part of the survey of Western Port was completed by 22 April but bad weather prevented \"Lady Nelson\" from leaving until 29 April. Grant noted: Western Port is capable of containing several hundred sail of ships with perfect security from storms, and will admit of being fortified. \"Lady Nelson\" then headed east with the intention of surveying the coast between Western Port and Wilsons Promontory but the weather prevented them from remaining constantly near the coast and Grant therefore decided to return to Port Jackson. Further bad weather was encountered and, after sheltering in Botany Bay for 24 hours, \"Lady Nelson\" arrived back at Port Jackson on 14 May 1801. Grant later wrote: the unfavourableness of the weather prevented me from completing the whole of my instructions ... It is true that the winter season of that climate was fast approaching; and instead of exploring to the southward we ought to have gone to the northward, by which means we should avoid many tempestuous gales.\n\nAfter a brief stay in Port Jackson \"Lady Nelson\" was sent to explore and survey the Coal River to the north of Port Jackson. The Coal River was later renamed Hunter River and is now the site of the City of Newcastle. \"Lady Nelson\" was accompanied by the colonial schooner \"Francis\". The two vessels left Port Jackson on 10 June 1801. \"Francis\" returned to Port Jackson on 26 June and the exploration party remained until 22 July 1801 when they departed for Port Jackson, arriving there on 25 July 1801.\n\nIn August 1801 Grant sought permission to relinquish his command and his request was granted. Grant's last voyage on \"Lady Nelson\" was to the Hawkesbury to load grain produced by local settlers, and transport it to Port Jackson. Grant returned to England on the brig \"Anna Josepha\", which departed on 9 Nov. 1801. Grant was replaced by John Murray, \"Lady Nelson\"s mate, who was appointed Acting-Lieutenant in command of the vessel.\n\nMurray was ordered to proceed to Bass Strait and survey those parts not covered during \"Lady Nelson\"s earlier voyages.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was victualled for a voyage of six months and left Port Jackson on her second survey voyage of Bass Strait on 12 November 1801. Land was sighted on 19 November that turned out to be Flinders Island, in the Furneaux Group, off the north-west tip of Tasmania, and not the Kent Group as intended. \"Lady Nelson\" anchored between Store House and Cat Islands in the Babel group of islands, off the east coast of Flinders Island, and remained there until 24 November.\n\nFrom the Furneaux Group, \"Lady Nelson\" headed for the Kent Group and anchored in West Cove on the eastern side of Erith Island. \"Lady Nelson\" remained in West Cove until 4 December during which time the channel, now known as Murray Pass, was comprehensively surveyed using her boats.\n\nFrom the Kent Group \"Lady Nelson\" headed north-west, passing Wilson's Promontory and Cape Liptrap and anchoring in Western Port on 7 December. Bad weather detained \"Lady Nelson\" in Western Port for several days, during which time she had to re-anchor several times.\n\nA light easterly wind enabled \"Lady Nelson\" to leave the anchorage in Western Port on 4 January. After stopping in Elizabeths Cove to replenish water casks, she followed the coast to the west. The next day: at 3 p.m. we saw a headland bearing west-north-west, distant about 12 miles and an opening in the land that had the appearance of a harbour north-west 10 or 12 miles. \"Lady Nelson\" sailed to within 1 miles of the entrance and from the masthead Murray observed: a sheet of smooth water ... and is apparently a fine harbour of large extent. Murray did not attempt to approach any closer to the harbour because of a fresh on-shore wind.\n\nNot being able to enter, the as yet unnamed Port Phillip, Murray continued west towards Cape Otway but was unable to make any further progress westwards due to a south-westerly gale and headed for calmer waters to the eastern side of King Island. \"Lady Nelson\" remained in the vicinity of King Island until 24 January during which time all except the west coast had been surveyed. As Murray 'took leave of this large and fine island', he noted:I much lament not having as yet had it in my power from the series of unfavourable weather we have met with so exactly to comply with the Commander-in-Chief's orders as I could wished. \"Lady Nelson\" left King Island on 24 January, and headed north intending to run to Cape Otway. However the weather intervened, Murray noting: 'I shall only observe that I never experienced such a length of bad weather at any time of the year, or in any country since I sailed the seas.' On sighting the land on 30 January Murray 'perceived with surprise that it was Cape Shanks [Cape Schanck] and Grant's Point instead of Cape Albany'. (\"Lady Nelson\" had been blown several miles to the east.)\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" therefore returned to Western Port and anchored there on 31 January 1802. Murray 'sent the launch with Mr. Bowen and five men, armed with 14 days provisions and water', to the westward to examine the entrance discovered earlier in the voyage (5 January 1802). Bowen returned on 4 February and reported that a good channel had been found into this new harbour that was larger than Western Port. \"Lady Nelson\"s launch was therefore the first European vessel to enter Port Phillip.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was unable to leave Western Port to examine the new harbour for several days due to light winds, Murray noting in his log on 13 February 1802:it fell calm and our hopes of getting to sea this day vanished, it is almost needless to observe that this kind of weather is as destructive to the intent of this cruise as gales at sea.\n\nA favourable wind enabled \"Lady Nelson\" to leave Western Port at 5 a.m. on 14 February. 'By noon the Island in the entrance of this harbour bore north half a mile distant' and the newly found harbour was entered, 'with all sail set', shortly after mid-day. Murray named the new harbour Port King, but Governor King later renamed it Port Phillip after the first Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" remained in Port Phillip for 25 days and on 8 March 1802 Murray proceeded: to take possession of this Port in the form and manner laid down ... , and accordingly at 8 o'clock in the morning the United Colours of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were hoisted on board and on Point Patterson, and at one o'clock under a discharge of three volleys of small arms and artillery the Port was taken possession of in the name of his Sacred Majesty George the Third of Great Britain and Ireland, King, etc., etc. The city of Melbourne was eventually to grow on the north shore of this port. \"Lady Nelson\" left Port Phillip on 11 March and returned to Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove on 25 March 1802.\n\nIn May 1802, King received instructions that \"Lady Nelson\" was to be employed as a tender to , during a planned voyage of discovery around the coast of New Holland, and that whilst so employed, Murray was to follow any orders he might receive from its commander, Captain Matthew Flinders.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" and \"Investigator\" sailed from Port Jackson on 22 July 1802 and headed north. Murray was directed, in case the two vessels became separated, to rendezvous in Hervey Bay.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" had difficulty in keeping up with \"Investigator\", but was able to keep their rendezvous at Hervey Bay. Both vessels continued northwards and \"Lady Nelson\" was, on occasion, able to survey parts of the coast where the deeper draught \"Investigator\" could not safely go. At times, Flinders left \"Investigator\" at anchor and boarded \"Lady Nelson\" to continue his survey work. Flinders carried out surveys in Keppel Bay, Shoalwater Bay and Broad Sound and \"Lady Nelson\" was present when Flinders discovered and named Port Curtis and Port Bowen (since renamed Port Clinton).\n\"Lady Nelson\" grounded several times, resulting in damage to her sliding keels, in consequence of which Murray had further difficulty keeping-up with \"Investigator\".\n\nAfter leaving Broad Sound Flinders headed for a cluster of islands, to the east of the Northumberland Isles, which he had seen from a hill at Shoalwater Bay. Both vessels anchored there on 29 September and Flinders named them Percy Isles.\n\nBoth vessels left the Percy Isles on 4 October and Flinders spent several days looking for a passage through the reef, anchoring several times in the process. \"Investigator\" lost an anchor and \"Lady Nelson\" lost one and broke one arm off another. Flinders decided not to attempt any more narrow passages through the reef and resumed the voyage towards Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Flinders provided \"Lady Nelson\" with two grapnels, which was all that \"Investigator\" could spare.\n\nOn 17 October Murray noted: I have now had several opportunities of seeing that from the want of our main and after keels we are so leewardly that the \"Investigator\" in 6 hours will get with ease 4 miles to windward of the brig.\n\nOn the same day Flinders decided to send \"Lady Nelson\" back to Port Jackson. She was sailing so poorly since losing her keels, that she not only delayed \"Investigator\", but ran great risk of herself being lost. Furthermore, instead of saving the crew of \"Investigator\", in case of accident, which was one of the main reasons for having a tender, it was likely \"Investigator\" might be called upon to save \"Lady Nelson\". Flinders saw \"Lady Nelson\", after her loss of anchors and cables, replacements for which \"Investigator\" could not spare without endangering her own safety, becoming a burden rather than an assistance.\n\nMurray received orders from Flinders 'to proceed to Port Jackson with the Lady Nelson as fast as circumstances would allow', and a letter to deliver to Governor King. \"Investigator\" headed north and \"Lady Nelson\" headed south. By 10.40 am, on 18 October, \"Investigator\"s topsails could just be seen from \"Lady Nelson\", disappearing over the horizon. This was the end of \"Lady Nelson\"s voyages of discovery.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" headed south, anchoring occasionally with the broken anchor, but, when pausing at Cape Townshend on 28 October, this anchor was lost. The remaining anchor was let go, but, in the process, \"Lady Nelson\" drifted away from the intended anchorage. With only one remaining anchor, and only one small boat, \"Lady Nelson\" was in a precarious situation.\n\nAs it was essential to move to a safer anchorage, Murray improvised an anchor by lashing two swivel guns together, which enabled \"Lady Nelson\" to sail into a more sheltered anchorage in Shoalwater Bay. The carpenter then went ashore in the boat to find an iron-bark tree with which to make a replacement anchor.\n\nThe remainder of the voyage to Port Jackson was uneventful and \"Lady Nelson\" anchored in Sydney Cove at 10.40 am on 22 November 1802.\n\nBefore her next significant voyage, \"Lady Nelson\" made another trip to Norfolk Island to convey troops to relieve the garrison there. This was probably \"Lady Nelson\" last voyage under Murray. \"Lady Nelsons\"s next commander was George Curtoys, (sometimes spelt Courtoys but spelt Curtoys in the commander's own log), previously the master's mate of , which had arrived from England in March 1803.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was one of the vessels selected to establish the first settlement in Tasmania. The desire to settle that part of Australia arose from King's concern that Baudin, leader of the French expedition in \"La Naturaliste\", intended to establish a settlement on the east side of Van Diemen's Land.\n\nKing chose Risdon Cove, on the east bank of the river Derwent, near where the city of Hobart now stands, as the site for the new settlement. Matthew Flinders and George Bass had previously visited the site during their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land.\n\nAn initial expedition to establish British sovereignty over Van Diemen's Land was made by Acting-Lieutenant Charles Robbins, who left Port Jackson in on 23 November 1802.\n\nLieutenant John Bowen, an officer in the recently arrived \"Glatton\", was chosen as Commandant and Superintendent of the new settlement and was instructed to proceed with \"Lady Nelson\" and \"Porpoise\", and with the men, women, stores, and provisions necessary for forming the intended settlement. The vessels departed for the Derwent on 11 and 17 June 1803 respectively.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" made good progress until 15 June when she encountered a strong southerly wind and Curtoys decided to head for shelter in Twofold Bay. The adverse winds continued for several days, driving her back to the north; on 21 June heavy seas resulted in the loss of the \"Lady Nelson\"s boat. The safety of Twofold Bay was not reached until 24 June by which time all \"Lady Nelson\"s supply of bread had been consumed and only three casks of water remained. A raft was constructed from her spars in order to get ashore to replenish their supply of fresh water and the \"Lady Nelson\"s carpenter was sent to cut timber with which to build a punt to replace the lost boat. \"Lady Nelson\" left Twofold Bay on 1 July to continue her voyage, but soon afterwards part of the main keel was seen drifting away astern. At this point the voyage was aborted and \"Lady Nelson\" returned to Port Jackson.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" arrived back in Port Jackson on 5 July and found that \"Porpoise\" had also turned back and had arrived two days earlier.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" departed again on 21 August 1803 but, two days out, her main mast was found to be sprung (damaged). Once again she had to return.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was repaired and set off again on 29 August 1803, this time accompanied by the whaler \"Albion\". \"Lady Nelson\" had a reasonably uneventful voyage and anchored in Risden Cove on the River Derwent on 9 September 1803. \"Albion\" arrived two days later. The next several days were employed in landing stores and establishing the settlers on shore. Both vessels had departed before the end of September leaving the settlement, comprising 49 souls, with no means of communication with the outside world.\n\nIn October 1803 two ships, \"Ocean\" and , arrived in Port Phillip, from England, with the intention of establishing a settlement. Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins was to be Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement. The venture was unsuccessful and a decision was taken to abandon the settlement and move its people to Van Diemen's Land. Two locations were considered: either the existing settlement on the Derwent, or a new settlement at Port Dalrymple.\n\nAs the only vessels available, \"Lady Nelson\" and \"Francis\", could not have carried out the task in a reasonable time, King hired the transport \"Ocean\" and the whaler \"Edwin\" to assist them. The 'fleet' therefore comprised four vessels.\n\nGeorge Curtoys, who had been ill for some time, had to relinquish command of \"Lady Nelson\" in November 1803, and returned to England in . He was replaced by James Symons, previously \"Calcutta\"s Mate, who took command for the voyage to Port Phillip.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" left Port Jackson on 28 November 1803. On board was the naturalist Robert Brown, one of the scientific people who came from England on \"Investigator\".\n\nRough weather was experienced on arriving in Bass Strait, and after beating a fortnight against a south-westerly wind, \"Lady Nelson\" took refuge in the Kent Group. Twice \"Lady Nelson\" left the anchorage there to try to reach the destination, and twice she had to return.\n\n\"Ocean\" arrived at Port Phillip on 12 December 1803 and \"Francis\" the next day. The master of \"Francis\" reported to Colonel Collins having seen smoke rising from one of the islands in the Kent Group. This raised concerns over the safety of \"Lady Nelson\", which had not yet arrived at Port Phillip.\n\nColonel Collins sent William Collins, in \"Francis\", to assess the suitability of Port Dalrymple as a place to re-settle the people from Port Phillip. The master of \"Francis\" was requested to sail via the Kent Group to look for \"Lady Nelson\".\n\nWilliam Collins found \"Lady Nelson\" in the Kent Group but by this time \"Francis\" herself was in a very leaky condition and was sent back to Port Jackson. William Collins continued to Port Dalrymple in \"Lady Nelson\", arriving there on 1 January 1804 and remaining until 18 January 1804. William Collins arrived back in Port Phillip, aboard \"Lady Nelson\" on 21 January 1804, with a favourable report on Port Dalrymple, but Colonel Collins had already decided to move to the Derwent.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" and \"Ocean\" left Port Phillip for the Derwent with the first contingent of settlers on 30 January 1804. \"Ocean\" returned to Port Phillip later and brought the remainder of the people. \"Lady Nelson\" left the Derwent on 6 March and arrived back in Port Jackson on 14 March 1804.\n\nDuring the next few months \"Lady Nelson\" was employed on various transport duties which included taking people to a new settlement to be established at Kingstown, soon after renamed Newcastle, on the Hunter.\n\nIn May 1804 King received instructions to close the settlement at Norfolk Island and transfer its existing settlers from there to a new settlement at Port Dalrymple in Van Diemen's Land; Bass and Flinders had discovered Port Dalrymple during their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land. Lieutenant Colonel Paterson was placed in charge as Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement.\n\nTo prepare the new settlement, for the people from Norfolk Island, Paterson left Port Jackson in the cutter \"Integrity\", accompanied by the sloop \"Contest\", on 7 June 1804, but bad weather forced both vessels back to port. Paterson subsequently departed on \"Buffalo\" on 15 October 1804 accompanied by \"Lady Nelson\", \"Francis\", and \"Integrity\".\n\nAt first good progress was made down the coast and \"Lady Nelson\"s log reported the 'squadron in company' on 18 October. On 22 October \"Lady Nelson\" encountered 'strong gales with a heavy sea from south-west' that caused considerable damage including the boat, binnacle and two compasses being washed overboard; and the main sheet carrying away and breaking the tiller. The next day the fore keel was found to have been broken-off and Symons decided to head into Twofold Bay for shelter and to carry out repairs to the vessel.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" anchored on the southern shore of Twofold Bay on 25 October and the crew again had to improvise a raft from the vessel's spars to get ashore. \"Lady Nelson\" got under way again on 3 November; attempts to leave on 1 and 2 November were both aborted due to the weather. She encountered the sloop \"George\", which was bound for the Derwent from Port Jackson, shortly after leaving Twofold Bay and its master gave a boat's compass to Symons to replace those lost in the storm.\n\nThe bad weather continued:\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" headed down the western side of Flinders Island, sighted Cape Barren on 9 November, 'beat in through the narrows' and on 10 November reached Kent's Bay, on the south side of Cape Barren Island, where the schooner \"Francis\" was found at anchor, also sheltering from the weather. \"Lady Nelson\" remained in Kent's Bay, repairing storm damage, until 13 November when both vessels got under way. The next day \"Lady Nelson\" sought shelter at Waterhouse Island and remained there until 20 November when the weather improved.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\", with \"Francis\" in company, finally reached Port Dalrymple on 21 November 1804. \"Buffalo\", a larger vessel, had arrived on 4 November 1804, and \"Integrity\" had arrived the next day.\n\nAfter she had unloaded her cargo, \"Lady Nelson\" was employed in surveying and erecting beacons in the harbour to facilitate the safe entry of ships into the new port.\n\n\"Buffalo\" and \"Integrity\" departed on 27 November, and \"Francis\" on 29 December 1804. \"Lady Nelson\", the last of the small squadron to leave, departed on 11 January 1805. The settlement was initially located at Outer Cove on the east side of the River Tamar but soon relocated to York Cove on the west side of the river. Eventually the settlement was moved further up the river to a spot near the confluence of the North and South Esk rivers that Paterson named Launceston. \"Lady Nelson\" arrived back in Port Jackson on 23 January 1805.\n\nIn April 1805 King received information that suggested that a Spanish armed schooner was anchored in Jervis Bay, 90 miles to the south of Sydney. King sent \"Lady Nelson\", under the command of Acting-Lieutenant Symons, to look for the Spanish vessel and, if found, bring her to Port Jackson.\n\nThe Spanish vessel was \"Extremeña\", an armed merchant vessel owned by merchants in Madras had seized on the coast of Chile. Britain and Spain were not at war at the time of the seizure, which was therefore illegal. On sighting \"Lady Nelson\", \"Extremeña\" tried to escape but Symons fired a shot across her bows, arrested her, and escorted her back to Port Jackson.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" continued to be employed in carrying passengers and supplies between Port Jackson and the other settlements along the coast of New South Wales and Tasmania for many years. Some of these voyages were recorded in the newspapers of the time. A few of these voyages are mentioned below where of particular interest.\n\nShe made a voyage to New Zealand in 1806 to return Tip-pa-he, a Maori Chief, to his residence. Tip-pa-he, was the head of the Maoris inhabiting the country contiguous to the Bay of Islands. Five of his sons accompanied him.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" was laid-up for a while at the time of the departure of Governor Bligh to England in March 1809, but soon returned to service and made four voyages to Hunter's River before the end of the year.\n\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie sailed in \"Lady Nelson\" to conduct a tour of inspection of the two settlements in Van Diemen's Land. She left Port Jackson on 4 November 1811 and returned on 6 January 1812, after calling at Newcastle and Port Stephens.\n\nThe evacuation of Norfolk Island, commenced in 1804, was not completed until 1813.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" made three voyages to VDL between 1807 -1813, the first in 1807 carried 35 men, women, and children from Norfolk Island to Hobart Town. The 15 men and one woman had been convicts sent to Norfolk Island but were now free settlers. Her second voyage was in 1808 when she carried 25 men women and child from Norfolk Island to Hobart Town. Her last voyage from Norfolk Island to Port Dalrymple was in 1813 when she carried 43 men women and children.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" left Port Jackson in December 1812, and a hired ship, \"Minstrel\", left in January 1813. After embarking the settlers at Norfolk Island, both vessels had arrived in Port Dalrymple by 4 March 1813.\n\nGovernor Macquarie left Sydney on 21 February 1816 and travelled overland to Windsor. He returned on board \"Lady Nelson\" to see the progress of the settlements along the Hawkesbury River and arrived back in Sydney on 26 February.\n\nOn 8 May 1819 \"Lady Nelson\", accompanied by \"Mermaid\", left Port Jackson to carry out a survey of the entrance to Port Macquarie. On board was the Surveyor General, Lieutenant John Oxley RN, who had discovered and named the entrance during an overland expedition the previous year.\n\nA decision was subsequently taken to establish a settlement at Port Macquarie. The establishment comprised 60 convicts and a detachment of 40 troops. They left Sydney on 21 March 1821 on board \"Lady Nelson\", \"Prince Regent\", and \"Mermaid\". The passage was unusually long due to adverse winds. While entering the river on 17 April \"Lady Nelson\" struck a sunken rock, but soon got off. \"Prince Regent\" also sustained damage, and \"Mermaid\" got aground the next day in crossing the bar, losing her rudder in the process. \"Lady Nelson\" was quickly repaired and ordered to return to Sydney to get help to repair the other two vessels but ran aground on rocks inside the bar when departing on 2 May 1821. Her rudder and stern-post were lost and her hull filled with water at high tide due to damaged planking. \"Lady Nelson\" was eventually repaired but did not return to Port Jackson until 1 May 1822, after an absence of 13 months.\n\nIn 1824 the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies directed that a settlement be formed on the north-west coast of the continent. The settlement was to cover Coburg Peninsula and Melville and Bathurst Islands.\n\nThe expedition embarked on , Captain Bremer, the transport ship , Captain Bunn, and \"Lady Nelson\", Mr Johns, Master. The three vessels sailed on 24 August 1824 and anchored in a cove in the strait between Melville Island and Bathurst Island. The cove was named King's Cove, and the expedition chose the south-east point of the cove for the settlement, and named it Point Barlow. The entrance to the anchorage was named Port Cockburn. Parties were sent ashore on 1 October to clear the ground and lay the foundations of a fort that they called Fort Dundas. On 8 September construction began on a pier to land provisions and heavy stores.\n\nThe establishment was in place by 10 November, and on 13 November 1824 \"Countess of Harcourt\" and \"Tamar\" departed, leaving Captain Maurice Barlow of the 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs), in charge. \"Lady Nelson\" remained as a guard and supply ship.\n\nThe settlement possessed rations for twelve months but there was no fresh meat. In December 1824, Barlow sent \"Lady Nelson\" and George Miller, who was responsible for maintaining a supply of provisions, to the Dutch settlement at Kupang on the island of Timor for supplies. Miller procured some buffaloes and goats, but most of the animals died before she returned to the settlement on 2 January 1825.\n\nWithin a week, \"Lady Nelson\" departed again to procure more livestock and whilst at Koepang, Miller encountered the schooner , bound from England to the new settlement at Melville Island. \"Lady Nelson\" returned with thirty small pigs that were lean and unfit for immediate use. During the five weeks \"Lady Nelson\" had been away scurvy had made its appearance among the prisoners, which made it imperative to obtain fresh provisions. \"Lady Nelson\" therefore sailed again, with directions from Barlow that Johns purchase whatever livestock he could get.\n\nWhen \"Stedcombe\" arrived at Port Cockburn, her Master entered into an agreement with Barlow to land, at the settlement, a cargo of buffalo, averaging 250 pounds (113 kg) in weight each, for a price of 25 Spanish Dollars each, and binding him to return in five weeks.\n\n\"Lady Nelson\" departed on the 19th and \"Stedcombe\" on 23 February 1825. In a letter dated 19 May 1825, Barlow wrote 'his schooner [\"Stedcombe\"] left this port four days after Johns' departure [in \"Lady Nelson\"], in charge of his Chief Mate, neither have returned since. I fear they either have been wrecked or fallen into the hands of the Malay Pirates'.\n\nBrief reports of the fate of the \"Lady Nelson\" appeared in the Gazette over the next few months:\nThe Lady Nelson, brig, had been most unfortunately cut off at Timor by the Malay privateers, and all the crew sacrificed, save the Captain. \nBy the arrival of the Faith, we learn, that the Lady Nelson had been despatched from Melville Island for fresh provisions to some of the islands in the neighbourhood of Timor, with instructions to avoid an island named Babba [Babar], where they would be great danger of her being cut off. This advice, however, unfortunately was not adhered to, but whether it was so by accident or design, we have not ascertained; the result is certain. Every soul on board, we regret to state, was cruelly massacred, and the hull of the vessel was seen some time after with the name painted on her stern. \nA gun, said to have been on \"Lady Nelson\" when she was lost, was examined in the village of Tutawawang, on Babar Island, in 1981 but no definitive conclusions appear to have been reached as to its provenance.\n\nThe Lady Nelson Visitor & Discovery Centre, Mount Gambier, South Australia, in 1986 built a full size non-sailing, replica of \"Lady Nelson\" in association with the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the proclamation of the colony of South Australia on 28 December 1836. In 2011 a survey of the replica found extensive rot in the hull timbers that put her beyond repair.\n\nThe Maritime Village Boatyard, at Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village, Warrnambool, Victoria, was commissioned to assess the condition of the replica and develop a plan for her restoration. The restoration completely replaced the hull with a fiberglass sheathed structure and the timber lower masts ith galvanised steel. The existing upper masts, spars and rigging were retained.\n\nThe rebuilt replica was transported from Warrnambool to Mount Gambier by road and mounted on a concrete slab; it now forms a tourist attraction at the Discovery Centre.\n\nThe Tasmanian Sail Training Association was established to build and sail a replica of the \"Lady Nelson\" as part of the celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of Australia in January 1788. She was built at a cost of more than $700,000 largely funded by Tasmanian taxpayers via the State Government, with assistance from local and corporate sponsors. \n\nRay Kemp built the replica at Woodbridge near Hobart in Tasmania. He built it largely from Tasmanian-grown timbers: blue gum keel and frames, celery-top pine deck, and Douglas fir lower masts. The spars are American-grown Oregon. \n\nKemp launched \"Lady Nelson\" on 29 November 1987. A commissioning ceremony was held on 17 December 1988 and the replica went on its first cruise, on the River Derwent, in March 1989.\n\nFrom July 1990 to early 1996 the replica \"Lady Nelson\" went on several voyages during the cold Tasmanian winter, across Bass Strait to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.The vessel also followed the fleets of the Melbourne to Hobart yacht race in 1993 and 1994. In more recent times the vessel has travelled:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230235", "title": "Asian American studies", "text": "Asian American studies\n\nAsian American Studies is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to Asian Americans. It is closely related to other Ethnic Studies disciplines, such as African American Studies, Latino/a Studies, and Native American Studies. \n\nAsian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at San Francisco State University and at the University of California, Berkeley, which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such \"college\" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units, and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The Association for Asian American Studies, a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.\n\nDrawing from numerous disciplines such as sociology, history, literature, political science, and gender studies, Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike \"Asian\" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.\n\nAcademic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies. \n\nAsian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad. \n\nThe discourse also includes studies on how first- and second-generation Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.\n\nAsian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: Orientalism, diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.\n\n\nMajor Asian American studies programs in California include those at University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of California, Irvine, University of California, Davis, San Francisco State University (SFSU), California State University, Long Beach, California State University, Northridge, California State University, Fullerton, City College of San Francisco, University of Southern California, The Claremont Colleges, and at UCLA.\n\nOutside of California, major programs include Dartmouth College, University of Washington, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Colorado, Hunter College, Cornell University, Binghamton University, and Columbia University. Other rising programs include Arizona State University, New York University, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Minnesota. Currently, several universities, including University of North Carolina, University of Virginia, Syracuse University, and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. \n\nMaster of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.\n\nAt the time of its founding (by Lee C. Lee) in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at Cornell University was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.\n\nOn the East Coast, the State University of New York at Stony Brook created an Asian & Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.\n\nHunter College, City University of New York, located in the Upper East Side in Manhattan is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the CUNY system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in New York City, Hunter College does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. \n\nQueens College, City University of New York, located in the neighborhood of Flushing in New York City, is home to the Asian/American Center. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).\n"}
{"id": "2230239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230239", "title": "Buff (colour)", "text": "Buff (colour)\n\nBuff is the light brownish yellow colour of buff leather. Buff colour is synonymous with ochreous colour. \n\nAs an RYB quaternary colour, it is the colour produced by an equal mix of the tertiary colours citron and russet.\n\nThe first recorded use of the word \"buff\" to describe a colour was in \"The London Gazette\" of 1686, describing a uniform to be \"...a Red Coat with a Buff-colour'd lining\". It referred to the colour of undyed buffalo leather, such as soldiers wore as some protection: an eyewitness to the death in the Battle of Edgehill (1642) of Sir Edmund Verney noted \"he would neither put on arms [armour] or buff coat the day of the battle\". Such buff leather was suitable for \"buffing\" or serving as a \"buffer\" between polished objects. It is not clear which bovine \"\"buffalo\"\" referred to, but it may not have been any of the animals called \"buffalo\" today.\n\nThe word \"buff\" meaning \"enthusiast\" or \"expert\" (US English) derives from the colour \"buff\", specifically from the buff-coloured uniform facings of 19th-century New York City volunteer firemen, who inspired partisan followers among particularly keen fire watchers.\n\n\"In the buff\", today meaning naked, originally applied to English soldiers wearing the buff leather tunic that was their uniform until the 17th century. The \"naked\" signification is due to the perception that (English) skin is buff-coloured.\n\nSand, rock, and loess tend to be buff in many areas.\nBecause buff is effective in camouflage, it is often naturally selected. \n\nMany species are named for their buff markings, including the buff arches moth, the buff-bellied climbing mouse, and at least sixty birds, including the buff-fronted quail-dove, the buff-vented bulbul, and the buff-spotted flufftail.\n\nIn areas where buff raw materials are available, buff walls and buildings may be found. Cotswold stone is an example of such a material.\n\nUnless bleached or dyed, paper products, such as Manila paper, tend to be buff. Buff envelopes are used extensively in commercial mailings.\nBuff paper is sometimes favoured by artists seeking a neutral background colour for drawings, especially those featuring the colour white.\nBuff domesticated animals and plants have been created, including dogs, cats, and poultry. The word \"buff\" is used in written standards of several breeds, and some, such as the Buff turkey, are specifically named \"buff\".\n\nIn 16th- and 17th-century European cultures, buff waistcoats (\"vests\" in American English), were considered proper casual wear. In the 17th century, the traditional colour of formal dress boot uppers was often described as \"buff\".\nClothing depicted on John Bull, a national personification of Britain in general and England in particular, in political cartoons and similar graphic works, has often been buff coloured. Bull's buff waistcoats, topcoats, trousers and boot uppers were typical of 16th- and 17th-century Englishmen.\n\nBuff is a traditional European military uniform colour. Buff has good camouflage qualities as sand, soil, and dry vegetation are buff in many areas. The term \"buff coat\" refers to a part of 17th-century European military uniforms. Such coats were intended to protect the wearer, and the strongest and finest leathers tend to be buff, so the term \"buff coats\" came to refer to all such coats, even if the colour varied.\n\nThe Royal East Kent Regiment was nicknamed \"The Buffs\" from the colour of their waistcoats. The phrase \"Steady the Buffs!\", popularised by Rudyard Kipling in his 1888 work \"Soldiers Three\", has its origins during 2nd Battalion's garrison duties in Malta. Adjutant Cotter, not wanting to be shown up in front of his former regiment, the 21st Royal (North British) Fusiliers, spurred his men on with the words: \"Steady, the Buffs! The Fusiliers are watching you.\"\n\nThe uniform of the American Continental Army was buff and blue.\n\nBuff is the traditional colour of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps.\n\nThe U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry specifies a \"buff\" tincture for certain coats of arms, often treating it as a metal for purposes of the rule of tincture.\nThe colours of George Washington University and Hamilton College are buff and blue, modelled on the military uniform of General George Washington and the Continental Army. Both General Washington and Alexander Hamilton, as chief of staff, had a role in the design of the uniforms.\n\nOther school colours described as \"buff and blue\" include Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., and Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nBuff is one of three colours of the Alpha Gamma Delta fraternity, and one of two colours of the Delta Chi fraternity.\n\nThe flags of Delaware and New Jersey, and the former flags of New York and Maine, officially feature buff.\n\nThe colours of the Whig Party, a British political faction, and later political party, as well as the American Whig Party, were buff and blue.\nThe funnels of the RMS \"Titanic\" and all other ships of the White Star Line were designated to be \"buff with a black top\" in order to indicate their ownership. There is some uncertainty among experts, however, as to the exact shade of what is now called \"White Star buff\". There is no surviving paint or formula, and although there are many painted postcards and at least seven colour photographs of White Star liners, the shades of the funnels in these varies due to many factors including the conditions under which they were originally made and the ageing of the pigments in which they were printed. Speaking mostly to scale modellers, the Titanic Research and Modeling Association currently recommend a colour \"in the range of the Marschall color\", meaning the colour in illustrations in a particular book.\n\nAs a relatively inexpensive and readily available paint colour, and one which went well alongside the near-universal black hull and white superstructure used on steamships at the time, White Star was far from the only shipping line to use a shade of buff as a funnel colour. The Orient Line and Norddeutscher Lloyd used an entirely buff funnel without the black top, while Canadian Pacific and the Swedish American Line employed a buff funnel with a representation of the company's house flag on them. The Bibby Line and the Fyffes Line are two of several firms to use the same \"buff with a black top\" scheme as White Star, but with a similar lack of certainty as to the exact shade used and how this differed from the famous White Star scheme. \nAs well as being a colour used by the United States Army Institute of Heraldry, buff is also recognized as a tincture by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It appears on the heraldic badge and flag of the Correctional Service of Canada.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230285", "title": "Franklins", "text": "Franklins\n\nFranklins was a supermarket chain selling packaged groceries and perishables throughout New South Wales, Australia. It created the \"No Frills\" brand of generic products, promoted by their mascot, \"Red Sock,\" and labelled itself \"Australia's Original Discount Grocer.\" Franklins also had stores in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia until 2001. In 2011 the chain was bought by Metcash and the stores were sold off to independent buyers to operate as IGA or Aldi supermarkets.\nThe last Franklins was at Westfield Miranda shopping centre; it closed in April 2015.\n\nIn 1941, Franklins was established in Sydney by Frank Lindstrom. It was his second supermarket chain, having sold his first one to Woolworths. In 1954, Franklins was acquired by Harold Cornock and Norman Tieck. Under their leadership it grew to cover much of New South Wales, and created a reputation for low prices.\n\nIn 1978, Cornock and Tieck sold the then 75-store supermarket chain to Hong Kong company Dairy Farm International, a member of the Jardine Matheson group, which maintained the chain's discount focus. Its turnover was A$1 million. Franklins launched its No Frills generic range of products (store brand). This was the first such range in Australia. The 'No Frills' brand became very important to Franklins as it provided the best value to customers. However, unlike Aldi in Europe, Franklins also retained a wide range of brand items. Franklins' stores outside NSW were branded black-and-white 'Franklins No Frills' to emphasize the label. Eventually the name replaced the white-on-red 'Franklins' in the home state of NSW, until the brand reverted to a red, white and black 'Franklins'. In retaliation, Woolworths later launched \"Home Brand\" and Coles launched \"Scotch Buy\" (later rebranded as \"Savings\"). Around this time, Bi-Lo began operations in Adelaide, using a similar format to Franklins.\n\nIn 1982, Franklins expanded outside of Sydney and ultimately New South Wales to open its first stores in Victoria, at Deer Park, Gladstone Park and Glenferrie.\n\nIn 1983, Franklins opened its first store in Queensland, at Toowoomba.\n\nIn 1989, Franklins opened its first store in South Australia. Franklins also launched FRFM, Franklins' own in-house radio station playing songs and advertising specials.\n\nBy 1989, Franklins had also expanded into the ACT, covering the east coast of mainland Australia and South Australia.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Dairy Farm International began to introduce new store concepts and branding ideas.\n\nIn 1990, Franklins opened attached liquor stores under the brand Liquor Save. Franklins also opened its 200th store the same year.\n\nIn 1992, Franklins Big Fresh was launched. This was a \"food barn\" format Dairy Farm had developed in New Zealand as \"Big Fresh\". Some existing stores were converted to this format, while others were newly built. These stores featured \"outback\" or farm style decorations, and animatronic displays which could be activated by customers - including singing chickens and dancing fruit. The first Franklins Big Fresh store opened in Leichhardt, and others were opened in Marrickville, Macquarie Centre and Gosford. The Gosford store featured a unique mini branch of the Commonwealth Bank within the store, as well as a small hairdressing kiosk. The hairdressing kiosk was rolled out to a number of other stores, although not all were the Big Fresh model. At the same time, Franklins started opening a few Mini Fresh stores in Queensland.\n\nIn 1994, Franklins launched Franklins Fresh, a mainstream supermarket format. In contrast to \"Franklins No Frills\" stores, they sold fresh produce, baked goods and meat as well as groceries. The \"Fresh\" part of the logo was similar to the one used by Big Fresh. It was designed to be a smaller version of Franklins Big Fresh. The first Franklins Fresh store opened in Engadine.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Franklins supermarkets comprised five main chains:\n\n\nIn 1998, Franklins launched its first advertisement on TV with its first slogan, \"More in your trolley for less\". It also trial converts selected \"No Frills\" stores to \"Franklins Fresh\" and installs environmentally friendly fluorescent lighting in these stores. First Choice, an alternative (and short-lived) generic product range, is also launched. Franklins, Franklins Fresh and Franklins Big Fresh also launched their websites that year.\n\nIn 1999, Franklins opened new stores and upgraded former No Frills stores to Franklins Fresh stores and unveiled its new logo, which is still used today, though it was only in use at selected stores at first. Also due to the logo change, Franklins Fresh also unveiled a new logo. The \"Liquor Save\" outlets were also re-branded as Franklins Liquor (attached to selected No Frills and Fresh stores) or Big Fresh Liquor. It had also positioned itself by this time as the national discount supermarket operator.\n\nIn 2000, Franklins sponsored the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. It sold a range of Paralympic merchandise. By the end of 2000, there were 287 stores.\n\nIn 2001, Franklins' mass expansion and reformatting ended in failure. Dairy Farm International exits from Australia in May, and many stores were sold to Woolworths (which got 67 stores), Coles (which got 20 stores), Foodland and IGA franchisees. A few closed. This saw the end of Franklins in the ACT, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. 86 stores across New South Wales were sold to South African retailer Pick 'n Pay, which also bought the Franklins name. The \"No Frills\", \"Fresh\" and \"Mini Fresh\" brands survived. \"Big Fresh\" did not and nearly all were bought by Woolworths and Coles. Pick 'n Pay bought all but one of the 21 Fresco supermarkets and rebranded them as Franklins stores at the same time. The other was shut down. The new Franklins launched the \"Saves You Money\" slogan. In January Aldi launched in NSW, and quickly filled the void left by Franklins in many areas.\n\nIn 2002, Foodland Associated Limited bought 36 Franklins stores across Queensland and Northern NSW as well as its Queensland warehouse facilities. All were rebranded as Action supermarkets. This saw the end for the \"Mini Fresh\" brand. The \"Fresh\" and \"No Frills\" brands were also retired, although their formats remain. All stores more than 2000 square metres are effectively \"Fresh\" stores. Franklins was relaunched with the slogan \"Look at us now!\".\n\nIn 2003, Franklins changed its slogan to \"That's what I like about Franklins!\". It also announced that it is not interested in owning petrol stations like most of its competitors. Later that year, the \"No Frills\" generic product range and the brand itself is revamped and then promoted by its new mascot, \"Red Sock\".\n\nIn 2004, the Franklins website was relaunched and Franklins joined the widespread trend of selling green plastic carrier bags. The fourth Pick 'n Pay era slogan was launched - \"Cheap and Cheerful\". The liquor outlets were relaunched as Franklins Local Liquor, in addition to the Canberra-based liquor chain. The annual \"Birthday Cash Jackpot\" competition is also introduced.\n\nIn 2005, Franklins started setting up franchise opportunities under the \"Franklins Family Supermarkets\" brand (similar to the \"Pick 'n Pay Family Supermarkets\" brand). By that time, there were 80 Franklins supermarkets across New South Wales. The only Franklins store to open that year was the one in Newcastle. The Franklins store in Erina Fair on the Central Coast was also closed, soon replaced by Aldi.\n\nOn 30 January 2006, Franklins opened a purchased store in Ulladulla NSW to show potential franchisees the benefits of changing from IGA to Franklins.\nAlso in 2006, Franklins launched its own loyalty club and begins changing a few stores to the franchise model.\nThere were 77 Franklins stores by the end of 2006.\n\nIn 2007, some new stores were opened. Two existing Franklins stores and another two IGA stores were converted to Franklins Family supermarkets. By the end of 2007 there were 80 Franklins stores.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, it was announced that all 85 stores Franklins had been sold to Metcash for A$215 million, to become part of the IGA chain. The stores will be sold individually to independent retailers. Franklins' last store was located at Westfield Miranda, this being the final Franklins in Australia closed in April 2015.\n\nHistorically, Franklins never advertised due to it being a \"no-frills\" supermarket. Instead, it advertised specials at the stores, much like Aldi does now. Later, it advertised through their own catalogues, especially when it introduced fresh foods and liquor to its stores. In the early 1990s Franklins launched its first TV advertisement with the slogans \"More in your trolley for less\" and \"Good ol' Prices are Back\". Shortly after Dairy Farm International exited the business in 2001, Franklins' advertisements used the slogan \"Saves You Money\".\n\nIn 2002, the new Franklins was launched with the slogan \"Look at us now!\". In 2003 it was changed to \"That's what I like about Franklins!\" and again in 2004 to \"Cheap and Cheerful\". That slogan is now rarely used, being largely replaced with and branded as \"Australia's Original Discount Grocer\".\n\nThe No Frills generic product range was relaunched in 2003 and promoted by its mascot \"Red Sock\" on TV advertisements and on its website. \"Red Sock\" now appears once every so often in the regular advertising on TV, radio, newspapers and catalogues for Franklins. In late 2009 Franklins changed back to the 2002 slogan \"Look at us now!\".\n\nIn 2011 the flash mobbing technique was used with shoppers and employees singing to promote Franklins during a time when Coles used their ever-popular \"Down, Down, Prices Are Down\" and price hand strategies. Woolworths also used flash mobbing and became accessible in all states and territories of Australia and during a time when Metcash, owners of the IGA brand - which acquired Franklins the previous year - began converting their stores to the IGA network.\n\nIn 2012, the last year of Franklins as a separate chain in its own right, Franklins returned to using the Dairy Farm-era slogans \"More in your trolley for less\" and \"Good ol' Prices are Back\" in retro-style promotions alongside its Pick-n-Pay-era \"Australia's Original Discount Grocer\" slogan. The chain also joined the divisive $1 milk price wars along with Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and some IGA supermarkets. In the brand's final years, it was used in place of the IGA brand as the stores were being sold off. A second \"Franklins Rewards\" program was launched when only the store in Westfield Miranda remained.\n\nNo Frills is Franklins' generic range of products. Launched in 1978, it was the first such brand range in Australia, and changed supermarket shopping habits in Australia. Franklins stores initially changed the store's format to revolve around the brand, selling little else. The \"No Frills\" name was also used up until 2002 for the name of the format Franklins had used which is best known for selling dry groceries and frozen perishables only.\n\nOriginally, the No Frills brand was only used for its peanut butter, honey and potato chips but has since expanded its range to more than 800 products in packaged groceries and perishables.\n\nIn late 2003, the \"No Frills\" generic product range and the brand itself had been revamped and was promoted by its new mascot, \"Red Sock\". Sold with a money-back guarantee, in many cases they're market leaders in their categories.\n\nThe No Frills logo was also used by former British discount retailer Kwiksave.\n\nThe No Frills brand is also used by Woolworths New Zealand, Hong Kong supermarket and Dairy Farm International subsidiary Wellcome.\n\nFirst Choice was another generic range of products Franklins had sold. Launched in 1998, it was developed to provide an alternative to the leading brands and have products with quality equal to or better than the leading brands. The products didn't just have the quality but also had prices that were anywhere between 10-15% cheaper than the national brands. \n\nFirst Choice had over 600 different products, and new products were continually being developed every day. The brand did not survive for long, though, and by the time Dairy Farm International exited the company in 2001, the brand was dropped, unlike No Frills, which continues to be sold at IGAs to this day.\n\nThe First Choice brand is still used by Hong Kong supermarket Wellcome.\n\n"}

He also represented the United States in the single scull at the 1960 Summer Olympics.\n\nParker attended the University of Pennsylvania as an undergraduate, where he majored in Philosophy and learned rowing. Mentored by Pennsylvania's coach Joe Burk, Parker rowed on the 1955 Penn Varsity crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta.\n\nAfter college, Parker began to scull competitively. He won the single scull (one man boat) at the 1959 Pan American Games. In 1959, Parker also competed in the Diamond Scull event at the Henley Royal Regatta finishing second to six-time champion Stuart MacKenzie.\n\nIn 1960, he won the U.S. Olympic trials in the single scull. At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Parker made the finals and finished fifth.\n\nDuring his training for the national team, Parker's name was forwarded to the athletic director at Harvard, Tom Bolles, who appointed the 27-year-old oarsman as the freshman coach in 1961. When Harvard's varsity coach, Harvey Love, died suddenly of a heart attack in the spring of 1963, Parker was promoted to the varsity level, purely on an interim basis. The crew had an uneven spring, and performed poorly at the Eastern Sprints (the league championship for the EARC). The annual highpoint of the Harvard rowing season is the Harvard-Yale race (the oldest and longest-running intercollegiate sporting event in the United States) held in June. Parker meticulously prepared his crew for their biggest race of the year. Heavy underdogs against the favored Yale crew, the Harvard varsity pulled off an upset. Parker was appointed permanent coach of the varsity crew. Harvard would not lose to Yale until 1981.\n\nParker's success was immediate and unprecedented. His crews won the Eastern Sprints every year between 1964 and 1970. Parker coached a Harvard four man boat (4+) at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Parker and the Harvard crew made the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1965. Parker's crews won the 1967 Pan American Games, and finished second at the 1967 European Championships. Parker's 1968 crew earned the right to represent the United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City—the last collegiate crew ever to do so. The Harvard 8 narrowly won the Olympic trials by 5/100th of a second over of a powerful University of Pennsylvania crew – a race that pitted Parker against his mentor Joe Burk.\n\nIn Mexico, one of Harvard's rowers became ill and had to be replaced. Harvard made the finals and finished sixth. Several members of the crew were involved in the political turmoil which swept over the games.\n\nHarvard was the last non-national team crew to represent the United States in the Olympics in the 8+ man event. Until 1960, the United States, using a trial system where the best 8 man crew went to the Olympics, had won every gold medal. But the rest of the world had caught up and was surpassing the USA. In particular, Karl Adam and his Ratzeburg crews from West Germany had become the team to beat. (Parker was one of the first US coaches to adopt Adam's methods). In 1972, the NAAO, the then governing organization for rowing in the United States, put together a national camp system to help ensure that the best rowers were in the national boat. Parker was named head coach. With Parker at the helm and with numerous former Harvard oarsmen in the boat, Team USA finished second to New Zealand earning a silver medal in the 8+ at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.\nIn the 1970s, Parker's Harvard crews continued to be successful. They did not win the Sprints in the years 1971–1973, but the losses were close. Then came the 1974 and 1975 Harvard varsities which are considered to be among the greatest in the history of the sport. They swept the collegiate competition, including dual races each year against the undefeated west coast champions Washington. Numerous team members went on to row for the national team. Post-season, the 1975 crew went to England to race at the Henley Royal Regatta. They finished second in the premier event of the regatta, the Grand Challenge Cup, losing to the British national team by two lengths.\n\nParker was also a path-breaking coach: he was the first women's national team coach in 1975. That eight went on to win a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships (the so-called Red Rose Crew). Parker would go on to coach the USA women's eight (8+) at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal where they earned a Bronze medal.\n\nParker's crews continued to be formidable in the mid and late 1970s, winning the Eastern Sprints in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1980. But Yale was on the rise; it won the Eastern Sprints in 1978 and 1979 and beat Harvard in doing so. Still, Harvard continued to win the Harvard-Yale race. Parker ran his streak to 18 years. Finally, in 1981, Yale ended the streak and would go on to win the next three races.\nIn 1983, Harvard won the Eastern Sprints, and in one of the best collegiate races ever, snatched the inaugural National Collegiate Rowing Championship by coming from a length down with 500 meters to go and catching a super-fast Washington boat at the line. Parker's 1985 Harvard varsity – after some early-season losses – won the Eastern Sprints, the National Collegiate Rowing Championship and the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta.\n\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harvard continued to be a dominating presence in rowing. Parker's crews won the national championship in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1992, and they were Eastern Sprints champions in 1988, 1989, and 1990.\n\nThe national championship race was disbanded in 1996, following which the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship, also known as the IRA, became the \"de facto\" national championship. Harvard had never gone to the IRAs during Parker's tenure, but in 2003, after a decade of good showings but no championships, Parker's varsity won the Eastern Sprints and decided to go to the IRA, which they also won. They continued the streak by winning both the Eastern Sprints and the IRAs in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe 2004 crew may have been Harvard's fastest crew ever. National team crews are older and more experienced than college oarsmen, and are far better prepared than when Harvard raced in the 1968 Summer Olympics. Following the 2004 season, the Harvard varsity went to Europe, where it rowed in the World Cup in Lucerne which was a tune-up for most of the national teams competing in the Olympics. In an upset, Harvard made the finals at Lucerne by defeating the British and French Olympic squads. Harvard lost to the five national teams in the finals at Lucerne, which included four of the top six finishers at the Olympic games—but they were competitive for the length of the course. Harvard then competed in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, losing in the finals to the Dutch Olympic 8+, which was also an Olympic finalist.\n\nHarry coached many entrances in the Henley Royal Regatta. His last attendance of the regatta, in 2012, saw his Varsity win by a foot over Leander in the Ladies' Plate. In 2013, two weeks after Harry's death, four members of his final varsity, coached by Bill Manning, broke the record in the Visitor's Challenge Cup.\n\nParker has nine official (or quasi-official) national championships, which is the second most among active coaches. Parker's crews from the 1960s and 1970s won several unofficial titles.\n\nHe completed 51 seasons at the helm, having confirmed his place as the most significant American coach of the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nOn September 10, 2008, Community Rowing, Inc. announced that it would name its new boathouse after Harry Parker. The boathouse is located in Brighton, MA. According to the press release,\nCommunity Rowing, Inc. (CRI), the largest public rowing organization in the United States, announced today that it will name its new $15 million boathouse after Harry Parker, Harvard University's men's varsity rowing coach. Mr. Parker, who is a resident of Winchester, MA is a Trustee of Community Rowing and longstanding supporter of efforts to bring the sport to a broader and more diverse audience. The official boathouse dedication will be held on Thursday, October 16, 2008 at 5:00pm.\n\nParker's first marriage, in 1959, with Elinor Goodman, whom he met at the University of Pennsylvania, produced two sons. It ended with their divorce in 1979. George Franklin Parker and David Lambert Parker were born during the 1960s. He later married Kathy Keeler, the stroke of the gold-medal winning USA Women's 8+ at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. They had a daughter named Abigail Parker.\n\nIn 2011, Parker was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Former Freshmen coach Bill Manning was promoted to Associate Head Coach when Parker began treatment. Parker died in Boston, Massachusetts at the age of 77 on June 25, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The squadron is permanently stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island with a radio callsign of \"\"Thunder\"\".\n\nTactical Electronic Warfare Squadron One Three Five was established on May 15, 1969, to provide electronic warfare and aerial refueling support to carrier air wings. It was stationed at Naval Air Station Alameda. The squadron first flew the EKA-3B Skywarrior and deployed to both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets.\n\nIn 1973, VAQ-135 relocated to NAS Whidbey Island and transitioned to the Grumman EA-6B Prowler.\n\nThe squadron first deployed with the EA-6B to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and the Indian Ocean from January to September 1976 with Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2) aboard . Following that deployment, VAQ-135 transitioned to the Improved Capability Prowler (ICAP) and became the first fleet EA-6B ICAP squadron. The squadron deployed with Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) aboard from November 1977 to July 1978 to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn January 1979, VAQ-135 commenced refresher training with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15) aboard and deployed to the Western Pacific in May 1979. During deployment, they received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and their first Chief of Naval Operations Safety “S” Award. They again deployed with CVW-15 aboard USS \"Kitty Hawk\" from April to November 1981. VAQ-135 participated in several major exercises throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans and received a second Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for their participation in the rescue of Vietnamese boat people.\n\nIn May 1982, VAQ-135 was assigned to and Carrier Air Wing 1 (CVW-1). After completing work-ups, the squadron was transferred to and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in November 1982 later receiving their second Chief of Naval Operations Safety “S” Award.\n\nIn 1984, the squadron deployed to USS \"America\" and CVW-1 from April until November 1984, receiving their third Chief of Naval Operations Safety “S” Award. In 1985, along with CVW-1 they participated in Ocean Safari ‘85, the largest NATO naval exercise to date, and received their second Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n\nOn the morning of January 1, 1986, VAQ-135 was deployed to support Sixth Fleet Battle Group operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Within 48 hours, they had sortied from NAS Whidbey Island, joined their new air wing Carrier Air Wing 13 (CVW-13) at sea on board and supported contingency operations underway in the central Mediterranean Sea. For the next five months, with no in-theater supply support, the squadron provided electronic warfare support to U.S. naval forces operating off the coast of Libya. The squadron took part in the successful strikes in the Gulf of Sidra in March 1986 and provided key close-support jamming services in the successful strikes on the Benina/Benghazi airfields in April of that year. As a result, the squadron was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award for 1986.\n\nIn November 1986, the squadron was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) aboard . In 1987, VAQ-135 completed work-ups with CVW-11 and became the first Prowler squadron to complete the Medium Attack Advanced Readiness Program (MAARP) and the revised EA-6B Defensive Air Combat Maneuvering (DACM) syllabus.\n\nIn January 1988, VAQ-135 became the first EA-6B squadron to deploy with five Prowlers. WESTPAC ‘88 marked the return of the squadron to the Seventh Fleet with USS \"Enterprise\", providing electronic warfare support to U.S. Naval forces operating in the North Arabian Sea. The squadron received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.\n\nIn April 1988, VAQ-135 participated with CVW-11 and Battle Group Foxtrot in Operation Praying Mantis, the successful action against Iranian naval surface units. The command received the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In the fall of 1988, the squadron transitioned to the ICAP-II version of the Prowler, acquiring the ability to fire the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile.\n\nIn September 1989, VAQ-135 deployed aboard \"Enterprise\" for an around the world cruise, taking part in PACEX ‘89, the largest naval exercise since World War II. In January 1990, the squadron participated in Operation Earnest Will in defense of the Philippine government, resulting in the command receiving the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.\n\nIn September 1990, the squadron deployed aboard . Their two-month maiden voyage took them from Naval Station Norfolk around Cape Horn to \"Abraham Lincoln\"s new homeport of NAS Alameda, California.

He entered the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1904, and graduated in 1907. In 1911-1912 he participated in the Italo-Turkish War with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant.\nDuring World War I he first served on the battleship \"Giulio Cesare\" as a Lieutenant and then, in July 1917, he was given command of the torpedo boat \"66 PN\". In this role he participated in several missions in the Adriatic, including, on 31 October 1918, the support to the Raid on Pula (\"66 PN\" was to tow near Pola one of the two MAS carrying Raffaele Rossetti, Raffaele Paolucci and their \"mignatta\", but she was forced to abort due to engine problems). For his bravery in combat actions in the Northern Adriatic he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor in November 1918.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1928 he served in China as naval attache to the Italian embassy and commanding officer of the gunboat \"Ermanno Carlotto\", stationed in Tientsin; during this period, in 1926, he was promoted to Commander. In 1928 he assumed command of a destroyer, and later (after becoming Captain in 1932) of the light cruiser \"Armando Diaz\" in the early 1930s, during a propaganda cruise abroad. In 1936 he was promoted to \"Contrammiraglio\" and in 1938 to \"Ammiraglio di Divisione\"; during the Spanish Civil War he was the commander of two groups of light ships. \nIn April 1939, onboard the light cruiser \"Giovanni delle Bande Nere\", he participated in the Italian invasion of Albania. In 1939 he became \"Ammiraglio di Squadra\". He also commanded the Livorno Naval Academy for a period.\n\nIn August 1940 Iachino was given command of the 2nd Naval Squadron (consisting of the 1st, 3rd and 7th Naval Divisions), with flag on the heavy cruiser \"Pola\", after its previous commander, Admiral Riccardo Paladini, came down with angina pectoris. In this role, he participated on 27 November 1940 in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. On 9 December 1940 he replaced Admiral Inigo Campioni as commander of the entire battle fleet of the Regia Marina, with flag on the battleship \"Vittorio Veneto\". \nOn 9 February 1941, Iachino led the Italian fleet in the unsuccessful pursuit of the British Force H, after the latter had bombarded Genoa and La Spezia. He again commanded the Italian battle fleet in the Battle of Cape Matapan (26-29 March 1941), which resulted in the biggest defeat ever suffered by the Regia Marina; dismissing reports of nearby British battleships as incorrect or exaggerated, he sent the entire 1st Cruiser Division to the rescue of the stricken cruiser \"Pola\", resulting in the annihilation of the entire Division by the three battleships of Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham's Mediterranean Fleet. His actions during this battle have been the subject of much criticism since then; despite this, Iachino wasn't relieved of command.\n\nIn July and September 1941 Iachino led the fleet in fruitless attempts to intercept British convoys to Malta (Operation Substance and Operation Halberd). During the First Battle of Sirte (16 December 1941) and the Second Battle of Sirte (22 March 1942) the forces under his command clashed with the escorts of British convoys heading for Malta, but despite his superior strength Iachino - concerned about not underestimating the enemy forces (to the point of believing incorrect reports about nonexistant battleships) and avoiding night action, both of which had been his fatal mistakes at Matapan - did not press the attack and was unable to cause significant damage to the convoys.\nOperation Vigorous (12-16 June 1942; known in Italy as the \"Battle of Mid June\") was instead his most important success; despite the losses caused by air and submarine attacks (the battleship \"Littorio\" was torpedoed, and the heavy cruiser \"Trento\" was sunk), he kept advancing towards the British convoy sailing from Alexandria to Malta, eventually leading to it aborting its mission and turning back to port.\n\nOn 5 April 1943 Iachino was replaced by Admiral Carlo Bergamini as the commander of the Italian battle fleet. At the same time he was promoted to \"Ammiraglio d'Armata\". In 1945 he was transferred to the reserve, but he appealed against this and was restored to active service in 1948. He finally left active service in 1954 and was discharged in 1962.\n\nDuring his later years he wrote several books about his actions during the war, especially focusing on Matapan and trying to justify his actions in that battle. In 1974 he donated the money for the construction of a Sailor's Monument in Taranto. He died in Rome on 3 December 1976, at the age of 87.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230299", "title": "Steinberg's (supermarket)", "text": "Steinberg's (supermarket)\n\nSteinberg's (renamed Steinberg in 1961) was a large family-owned Canadian grocery store chain that mainly operated in the province of Quebec and later Ontario. In addition to its flagship supermarket chain, the company operated several subsidiaries across the country. The company went bankrupt in 1992, three years after being sold to private interests, after 75 years in business.\n\nSteinberg's began as a grocery store founded in 1917 in Montreal by Jewish-Hungarian immigrant, Ida Steinberg. Her five sons, led by Sam Steinberg, grew the company from a tiny storefront on St. Lawrence Boulevard into the most popular and largest supermarket chain in Quebec. It was the first to create the \"supermarket\" concept in Quebec, in 1934, with expansions into Ontario (primarily the Ottawa area) and parts of New Brunswick.\n\nSteinberg's opened more stores in Montreal and Quebec over the years. Steinberg's entered the real estate market in 1952 under the name Ivanhoe Investments and owned several shopping centres. During the expansion years, the plan was to landbank properties in Quebec for future development into shopping centres and stores. Ivanhoe turned out to be one of Steinberg's most profitable ventures and continues today under the name Ivanhoe Cambridge. Steinberg's also had holdings in food production and distribution.\n\nIn keeping with increasing French language pressures in Quebec, Steinberg's dropped the possessive \"'s\" from its name to become \"Steinberg\" in 1961. This was accompanied with the introduction of a new logo as shown above this article (the previous logo had consisted of Sam Steinberg's personal signature). Despite the change, the chain continued to be referred to as \"Steinberg's\" among the English-speaking public and media throughout its history and beyond.\nFor several decades, and until the late 1980s, Steinberg's was the largest supermarket chain in the province of Quebec. Store outlets could be spotted in nearly every district of the island of Montreal and was a major competitor for chains like Provigo and Metro. Sam Steinberg was one of the first employers to implement mandatory bilingualism (English and French) for all his personnel and as a result, the company became so entrenched in Quebec culture that among French speakers, \"\"Je fais mon Steinberg\"\" (\"I'm doing my Steinberg's\") became a synonym for going grocery shopping, regardless of supermarket chain.\n\nIn 1959, Steinberg's made its expansion west of Ottawa into Ontario by acquiring 38 Ontario stores that Grand Union had put up for sale. This formed the basis of Steinberg's Ontario division. Until Loblaws expanded into Quebec through acquisition, there had been an unspoken agreement between Steinberg's and Loblaws that one would not enter the other's market. What Steinberg's found was that the locations of many of the Grand Union stores they acquired were in less-than-ideal locations compared to their already established competitors, and over time most were closed or relocated to new stores. The Ontario stores lost money because of competition, poor locations, and the imposition of a Quebec style of management and retailing that did not suit the Ontario market. The branding of Steinberg's Ontario's supermarkets was changed in the late 1960s to Miracle Food Marts outside of eastern Ontario, some operating next to a Miracle Mart department store. A new food and drug store chain, Miracle Ultra-Mart stores, was introduced in the mid-1980s. The main warehousing and administrative offices were in Rexdale (Etobicoke, now part of Toronto). The Ottawa, Cornwall and Brockville stores were part of the Quebec division rather than the Ontario division.\n\nAt one point a hypermarket was introduced called \"Steinberg Beaucoup\", which consisted of a Steinberg's grocery, a Miracle Mart department store and Le Quick and Pik-Nik restaurants, all under the same roof. In Ontario, they were opened as \"Miracle Beaucoup\" stores with Miracle Food Mart as the grocery store. The first two Beaucoup stores were opened in Laval, Quebec, and Bramalea, Ontario\n\nSteinberg's owned and operated several well-known businesses aside from their own name-brand supermarket chain:\n\nIn addition, Steinbergs had partial ownership of:\n\nTrouble started brewing for the chain after the death of Sam Steinberg in 1978; his laissez-faire dealings with the union and lack of a succession plan for the company began its decline, and resulted in a trend of higher unionized labour costs than other unionized and non-union supermarkets, and a general loss of direction of the company without its former leader. Things worsened rapidly when a power struggle developed between his daughter Mitzi, her husband Mel Dobrin, daughter Marilyn Steinberg Cobrin and daughter Evelyn Steinberg. Each held equal controlling shares in the company through trusts, but these shares and those of their mother Helen, were stipulated to be voted together as one, to keep control of the company in the family.\n\nAfter a number of years under lackluster leadership, Irving Ludmer became CEO in April 1984. Ludmer was a former Steinberg's real estate vice president who worked with the company from 1957 until leaving NB to start his own real-estate company in 1971. He tried to reinvigorate the company and give it some direction following the chaotic years since Sam's death. He had rejoined real-estate branch Ivanhoe in 1983, and had become close to Sam during his early years at the company. He initiated sweeping changes throughout the company, resulting in improved sales, stock prices, and a general all-around improvement in Steinberg's, making it more attractive on the stock market.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, family infighting, power struggles, rising costs and increased competition were taking their toll, and Steinberg's was placed on the auction block for an estimated $1.5 billion. The Ontario-based Loblaws chain attempted to acquire Steinberg's, but was blocked by the Quebec provincial government on nationalist grounds. Other potential buyers included Toronto-based Oxdon Investments, Oxford Development, Metro-Richelieu, Provigo, and a leveraged buyout from company executives Irving Ludmer and Arnold Steinberg. In the end, the company was sold for $1.3 billion on August 22, 1989 to a joint bid between Socanav (a marine shipping firm with no experience in retail, and whose major shareholder Michel Gaucher helped set up the deal) and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Quebec's pension-fund manager.\n\nUnder Socanav's ownership, Steinberg's ran some locations as franchises for the first time. Smaller Quebec grocery chains such as Metro-Richelieu and IGA had used a franchising model for some time. The company could save on labour costs, as those stores could employ non-unionized labour paid at lower wages than Steinberg's company-operated stores.\n\nThe buyout of Steinberg's was highly leveraged. Despite improved profitability and cash flow results from Steinberg's after the buyout, various parts of the company were auctioned off by new owner Socanav to help pay down the heavy debt load incurred. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec wanted Steinberg's real estate arm Ivanhoe for its attractive portfolio from the start, and acquired it for $887 million in 1990. Steinberg's 50% stakes in both Lantic Sugar and Price Club were sold in 1990 for $110 million and $58 million respectively. After ongoing talks, A&P Canada agreed to buy the Ontario operations (consisting of 58 Miracle Food Marts, 11 Miracle Ultra-Marts, and Ontario divisional offices in Etobicoke) in July 1990 for $235 million, with the closing date of October 20, 1990. The stores continued to operate under their former names, but were eventually rebranded under the \"A&P\" and \"Dominion\", and Ultra Mart/Ultra Food & Drug banners.\n\nThe final 10 Ontario stores in the Ottawa, Cornwall and Brockville locations (not included in the sale to A&P since they were all part of the Quebec division) were bought by Loblaws (under National Grocer Co.) in January 1992 and either converted to \"Loblaws\" or \"Your Independent Grocer\" banners, or closed. The sale included two operating as Xtra discount supermarkets. Those were the final stores Steinberg's owned in Ontario, aside from 74 Valdi stores that the chain held onto (a combined 101 in Ontario & Quebec). Valdi Foods remained a company subsidiary until the stores in the western provinces were closed in 1991/92.\n\nAttempts to sell off more assets and restructure the company (including rebranding some stores and franchising others) were difficult, due to Steinberg's higher labour wages, the 1990-1992 recession, suppliers unsure of supplying the highly leveraged company, pressure from creditors, mounting losses and interest payments on debt from the leveraged buyout. In May 1992, court protection was obtained in order to liquidate the company and pay off creditors. Loblaw again attempted to buy the chain. They were again foiled by the Quebec government, who arranged for Steinberg's stores to be sold to its two major local competitors Metro Richelieu and Provigo. To avoid accusations of monopoly, Metro and Provigo sold some Steinberg's stores to The Oshawa Group (IGA). \n\nBy June 1992, Steinberg's and its poor-performing department store chain M began phased out. The Steinberg's stores were absorbed and converted by its competitors, while the M locations closed outright as no buyer could be found for them. The last Steinberg's stores closed on September 5, 1992. \n\nAlthough Steinberg's, Miracle Mart/M, Miracle Food Mart, Valdi and Cardinal Distributors are now defunct, Sam Steinberg is survived by his real estate company Ivanhoe (which absorbed Cambridge Shopping Centres Ltd in 2001 to become Ivanhoe Cambridge). His restaurant chain Pik-Nik, founded in 1966, lasted until the mid-2010s.\n\nSuccession for the Steinberg's grocery chain was the subject of a 1974 National Film Board of Canada documentary by Arthur Hammond entitled \"After Mr. Sam\".\n\n\n"}

Closely related to other ethnic studies disciplines such as African-American studies, Asian American studies, and Native American studies, Latino studies critically examines the history, culture, politics, issues, and experiences of Hispanic people. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as sociology, history, literature, political science, religious studies and gender studies, Latino studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work.\n\nIn academia, Latino Studies stemmed from the development of Chicana/o Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs in response to demands articulated by student movements in the late 1960s in the United States. These movements unfolded amid a nationwide climate of heightened social and political activism, incited by opposition to the Vietnam War, the American Feminist movement, and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAt some institutions of higher education in the United States, the 1970s and 1980s saw the consolidation of Latino Studies as an autonomous discipline while other institutions chose to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs—reflecting a diversity of institutional responses to the nascent academic discipline.\n\nDebates on the academic and institutional location of Latino Studies continue to present day: while some scholars strive to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs that explore the exceptionality of national experiences, in the context of a globalizing Latino diaspora and diversifying Latino student populations at U.S. universities, many others support the notion of Latino Studies as an \"umbrella\" field designed to explore pan-Latino experiences and histories that transcend nation-bound analytical frameworks introduced by pioneering Chicano and Puerto Rican studies programs. Yet others advocate for the absorption of Latino Studies into broader comparative disciplines such as ethnic studies, American studies, and Latin American Studies. Accordingly, the status of Latino Studies significantly differs from institution to institution in terms of nomenclature, pedagogical practice, and disciplinary location—with examples ranging from degree-granting autonomous departments to interdisciplinary (and multidisciplinary) programs to university-affiliated research centers.\n\nThe first Chicano Studies program was established at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) in Fall 1968 in response to demands articulated by student activism movements. Initially named the Mexican American Studies Program, the program was instituted at CSULA as the Chicano Studies Department in 1971. Similar initiatives developed simultaneously at other California universities. In 1969 at a statewide conference held at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Chicano students, activists and scholars drafted the Plan de Santa Bárbara a 155-page manifesto for the implementation of Chicano Studies in institutions of higher education in California. While the Regents of the University of California did not formally adopt the manifesto as an institutional mandate, it served as a blueprint for the establishment of Chicano Studies programs across public universities in the state. However, in calling for the establishment of comprehensive Chicano Studies programs—including departments, research centers, a Chicano studies library—and recommending the adoption of a host of institutional practices, many California universities implemented only certain elements of the plan.\n\nWhile Chicano studies programs proliferated across campuses in California, Texas-based institutions also played pivotal roles in development of early Chicano Studies programs, including the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 1970 and the Center for Mexican American Studies (CMAS) at the University of Texas at Arlington founded in 1993.\n\nIn 1969, a parallel wave of student activism took place at City University of New York (CUNY) south campus, spearheaded by the efforts of Puerto Rican and African American Students. These efforts culminated in the spring of 1969 when students staged the Open Admissions Strike. The students' central demand was the adoption of a non-competitive open admissions policy. The expanded admissions policy would, in effect, diversify the student body by guaranteeing placement at CUNY for all New York City high school graduates. In addition to demands for an open-admissions policy, student activists demanded academic programs in Black and Puerto Rican Studies. In response, CUNY created the Department of Urban and Ethnic Studies. With continuing student activism, the Department of Puerto Rican Studies was formed in 1971, followed by the establishment of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies as a university-based research institute in 1973. Student activism related to the demand for Puerto Rican Studies was not limited to CUNY, and effervesced across New York public campuses including Brooklyn, Lehman, Queens and Bronx Community Colleges.\n\nAs Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs stemmed largely (but not exclusively) from the east and west coasts, institutions in the American Midwest pioneered some of the first academic departments with a multinational or transnational Latino Studies focus. These programs included the Center for Chicano-Boricua Studies at Wayne State University (established in 1972) and the Chicano-Boriqueño Studies Program (now the Latino Studies Program) at Indiana University (established in 1976).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, dozens of universities across the country followed suit and established academic programs and departments (see list of major departments) in Latino Studies. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the emergence of a number of research initiatives and professional societies dedicated to the advancement of a Latino Studies research agenda. These initiatives including fellowships offered by the Ford, Rockefeller, Compton and Mellon Foundations and the establishment of research institutes including The InterUniversity Project on Latino Research, the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and the Julian Samora Research Institute.\n\nThe location of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education—in terms of disciplinary boundaries, but also with regard to the field's perceived legitimacy as an academic discipline and field of scholarship—is contested.\n\nWhile Latino Studies is sometimes encompassed under the umbrella of ethnic studies, it is important to note that the discipline's course of development in different areas of the United States has been shaped by regional demographics, including the demographic composition of a college campus' student body. In the case of Latino Studies, the American northeast and southwest have served as especially salient battlegrounds for these debates to unfold.\n\nStaunch critics of ethnic studies programs include Ward Connerly, former University of California Regent, who was involved in the successful effort to ban affirmative action in California places of employment and higher education in 1996 with California Proposition 209. Connerly accused ethnic studies programs of being \"divisive\" and balkanizing.\n\nMore recently, Latino Studies faced legal challenges in Arizona with House Bill 2120 which (echoing the Arizona ban on ethnic studies effectuated in Tucson public schools in 2011) sought to prohibit public universities in the state from activities and classes including those that \"promote division, resentment or social justice toward a race, gender, religion, political affiliation, social class or other class of people\"; \"are designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group\"; or \"advocate solidarity or isolation based on ethnicity, race, religion, gender or social class instead of the treatment of students as individuals.\" (On January 17, 2017 Arizona House Education Committee Chairman Paul Boyer denied a hearing, effectively killing the bill.)\n\nAmong scholars and administrators in support of Latino Studies and other ethnic studies programs, opinions are divided on the positioning, status and definition of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education. These debates arise from theoretical and epistemological inquiry but also from concerns surrounding funding and institutional support for university departments and academic programs.\n\nIn the late 1990s, at the height of tensions between nationally-specific programs like Chicano Studies and Puerto Rican Studies and nascent pan-Latino Studies programs, Ignacio Garcia (Professor of Western American Studies at Brigham Young University) advocated for the autonomous departmental status of Chicano Studies—posing the emergence of Latino Studies as a challenge to that ideal. In his 1996 essay \"Juncture in the Road: Chicano Studies since 'El Plan de Santa Barbara\", Garcia argued:\n\nMany centers find themselves challenged by non- Chicano Latino scholars who want to promote their scholarly interests. They argue that all Latino groups have a common experience with racism and poverty in American society. Also, programs which emphasize the inclusive Hispanic approach are more likely to gain research and support funds more easily. Because immigration has been a major area of study for Chicano Studies and because the immigrant groups are now more diverse among numerous Latino groups, there is an intellectual challenge to Chicano Studies to become inclusive or else to be seen as shallow and exclusionary.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, scholars including Frances Aparicio (Professor of Spanish and Portuguese and Director of the Latina and Latino Studies Program at Northwestern University), Pedro Cabán (Professor and Chair of the Department of Latin American, Caribbean & U.S. Latino Studies at SUNY Albany), and Juan Flores (former Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and Director of Latino Studies at New York University)—argued in support of an interdisciplinary Latino Studies field of scholarship with a transnational focus.\n\nIn his 1999 essay \"New Concepts, New Contexts,\" Juan Flores—an advocate for the freestanding autonomy of Latino Studies departments—described the potential \"dilution\" or \"distortion\" of the field when subsumed into umbrella departments. Flores identified that at a time when many public universities were being consolidated, Latino Studies programs were blossoming at private universities across the country. Nonetheless, recognizing political and pragmatic concerns, Flores recommended that departmental status should be evaluated on a \"case-by-case\" basis in order to best place the discipline according to the needs and demands of a particular institutional environment.\n\nPedro Cabán considered the tensions and contradictions between Latino Studies as a discipline borne from student activism and institutional demands placed upon the discipline, writing:\n\nIf deployed uncritically, the Latino label can result in sanitizing a history of political activism and critical engagement that is the legacy of the struggles of the 1960s ... if Latino Studies programs are to be successful and relevant to legions of students, they will need to retain the normative values that defined their transformative goals, and obtain the academic authority that traditional disciplines possess (hiring, promotion and tenure, curriculum development, discretion over budgets, etc.) \n\nReflecting upon Latino Studies programs existent in 1999, Aparicio warned that the ideal of interdisciplinarity is often unfulfilled, arguing that Latino Studies programs are often multidisciplinary aggregates of nationally-bounded scholarship: \"Latino studies programs are constituted by a list of courses discrete in their national and disciplinary boundaries that add up to \"lo latino\".\" \n\nEarly Chicano Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs developed in a parallel fashion: both emerged from activist struggles, developed within nation-bound analytical frameworks and drew influences from economic liberation, antiracism, and critical consciousness theories.\n\nHowever, Pedro Cabán argues that the two schools of thought differed in one significant way: \"Whereas the Chicano historiography and the emerging social science literature primarily explored the Chicano experience in the US, early Puerto Rican Studies was heavily invested in reinterpreting the economic history of Puerto Rico under US colonial domination.\" \n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, newly formed Latino Studies programs tended to emphasize interdisciplinarity and transnationalism. A number of pre-existing programs were restructured, consolidated or renamed to encompass this broader scope. Scholars in the field have identified the 1990s as a turning point in the discipline's history, as scholarship shifted away from \"male-centered nationalistic discourse\" and became increasingly influenced by intersectional identity formation theory, including feminist and queer theory.\n\n\n\"The following is a working list of programs throughout the United States associated with \"Latino Studies\" in chronological order of establishment.

Gazzaniga (born December 12, 1939) is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he heads the new SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind. He is one of the leading researchers in cognitive neuroscience, the study of the neural basis of mind. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1961, Gazzaniga graduated from Dartmouth College. In 1964, he received a Ph.D. in psychobiology from the California Institute of Technology, where he worked under the guidance of Roger Sperry, with primary responsibility for initiating human split-brain research. In his subsequent work he has made important advances in our understanding of functional lateralization in the brain and how the cerebral hemispheres communicate with one another.\n\nGazzaniga's publication career includes books for a general audience such as \"The Social Brain\", \"Mind Matters\", \"Nature's Mind\", \"The Ethical Brain\" and \"Who's in Charge?\". He is also the editor of \"The Cognitive Neurosciences\" book series published by the MIT Press, which features the work of nearly 200 scientists and is a sourcebook for the field. His latest monograph is entitled \"Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain\". It was published by HarperCollins in 2011.\n\nGazzaniga founded the Centers for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of California, Davis and at Dartmouth College, the Neuroscience Institute, and the \"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience\", of which he is the Editor-in-Chief Emeritus. Gazzaniga was a member of U.S. President George W. Bush's Council on Bioethics. He was also the Director of the Law and Neuroscience Project, a project to study the intersection of law and neuroscience.\n\nIn 2019, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate.\n\nGazzaniga's work is mentioned in the novel \"Peace on Earth\" by Stanisław Lem. \n\nIn 2010 a tribute volume to the work of Gazzaniga was published, containing contributions by Joseph LeDoux, Stephen Kosslyn, Steven Pinker and others.\n\nGazzaniga has led pioneering studies in learning and understanding split brained patients and how their brains work. He has performed numerous studies and done large amounts of research on split brain patients to provide a higher quality understanding into the lives of those affected by this rare phenomenon. He has studied how people who have the two halves of the brain separated function in comparison to those who do not. Gazzaniga has looked into what bodily functions are controlled by each half of the brain. He has looked at what split brained patients are able to do as a result of their condition such as the ability to draw two different objects with each hand, an ability that a person with a non split brain is unable to do. They study how those with split brain act emotionally and physically in comparison to those who do not have a split brain. Through Gazzaniga’s studies a much greater understanding of the split brain phenomenon has been brought to other physiologists as well as the general population of the world.\n\nPatient W.J. was a World War II paratrooper who got hit in the head with a rifle butt, after which he started having seizures. Before his operation to try to fix the seizures, Gazzaniga tested his brain functions. This included presenting stimuli to the left and right visual fields and identifying objects in his hands that were out of view. He was able to perform these tasks perfectly and afterwards he had the surgery that split his corpus callosum and anterior commissure. After his surgery, he was brought in again for testing with Gazzaniga in which stimuli such as letters and light bursts were flashed to the left and right visual fields. The stimuli flashed to the right visual field were processed by the brain’s left hemisphere, which contains the language center, so he was able to press a button to indicate he saw the stimulus and could verbally report what he had seen. However, when the stimuli were flashed to the left visual field, and thus the right hemisphere, he would press the button, but could not verbally report having seen anything. When they modified the experiment to have him point to the stimulus that was presented to his left visual field and not have to verbally identify it, he was able to perform this task accurately.\n\nPatient W.J.’s divided corpus callosum could also cause conflicts between the hemispheres. An example of this could be seen with his hands, where each hand was controlled by the opposite hemisphere, and there was no communication between the two. This would result in moments where one hand might reach out to open a car door while the other would try to stop that hand from opening the door.\n\nPatient P.S. was a teenage boy in whom it was shown that language comprehension was possible in the right hemisphere. When the word “girlfriend” was flashed to his left visual field, and thus his right hemisphere, he could not verbally say the name of his “crush”, but he then spelled out the name “Liz” with Scrabble tiles. This suggested that even though verbal language was not possible in the right hemisphere, there was a form of language possible through gesturing and left hand movements.\n\n\n\n"}

Practitioners advocate for decolonization of indigenous peoples, political autonomy, and the establishment of a discipline dedicated to alleviating contemporary problems facing indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Native historical experience in the Americas is marked by forcible and sometimes willing attempts at assimilation into mainstream European American culture (Americanization). Beginning with missionaries and leading up to federally controlled schools, the aim was to educate American Indians so that they could go back to their communities and facilitate the assimilation process. As cited by David Beck in his article \"American Indian Higher Education before 1974: From Colonization to Self-Determination,\" the schools were used as a tool for assimilation. Their main focus was not intellectual but to give training for industrial jobs or domestic jobs.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1960s contested mainstream methods of assimilationist indoctrination and the substance of what was being taught in K-12 schools and universities throughout the United States. American Indian students, coupled with sympathetic professors, assisted in creating new programs with new aims. Rather than being focused on Indians going back to their communities to educate along the lines of assimilation there was a move to educate for empowerment. Programs that did community outreach and focused on student retention in campuses have risen out of that movement. Furthermore, the programs in schools created a new interpretation for American Indian history, sociology, and politics.\n\nDuring the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars in March 1970 at Princeton University, indigenous scholars drafted a plan to develop \"Native American Studies as an Academic Disclipine,\" which would defend indigenous control of their lands and indigenous rights and would ultimately reform US Indian Policy. This discipline would be informed by traditional indigenous knowledge, especially oral history, and would \"defend indigenous nationhood in America.\"\n\nIn direct opposition to Western anthropology, the knowledge base of Native American studies is endogenous, or emerging from within the indigenous communities. Developers of Native American studies widely dismissed the notion of scientific objectivity, since Western cultural biases have historically informed anthropology and other disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230357", "title": "Poussinists and Rubenists", "text": "Poussinists and Rubenists\n\nIn 1671 an argument broke out in the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the Poussinists (Fr. \"Poussinistes\") who were a group of French artists, named after the painter Nicolas Poussin, who believed that drawing was the most important thing. On the other side were the Rubenists (Fr. \"Rubénistes\"), named after Peter Paul Rubens, who prioritize color. There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was Flemish, though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when Antoine Watteau's \"The Embarkation for Cythera\" was accepted as his reception piece by the French Academy in 1717. By that time the French Rococo was in full swing.\n\nThe Poussinists believed in the Platonic idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or \"disegno\"), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was Charles Le Brun (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were Raphael, the Carracci, and Poussin himself, whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art.\n\nThey were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature. Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature. Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the Renaissance that painting, as a liberal art, could only be appreciated by the educated mind.\n\nIn 1672, Charles Le Brun, Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that \"the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind.\" He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of Roger de Piles, who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 \"Dialogue sur le Coloris\" (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 \"Conversations sur la Peinture\" (Conversations on Painting).\n\nThe argument was similar to the argument over the merits of \"disegno\" and \"colore\" in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King.\nTo a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a \"history\" painting.\n\nA success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699, and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when Antoine Watteau's \"The Embarkation for Cythera\" was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717.\n\nWatteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his \"fête galante\" works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a \"peintre des festes galantes\". While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: \"The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.\"\n\nWatteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin benefited from the new found interest in still-life and genre painting.\n\nThe debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. Michael Levey has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of genre, landscape and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or \"laissez-faire\" as is sometimes assumed.\n\nThe argument also took place during the beginning of the Enlightenment and the Rubenists found support in John Locke's \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690), which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. Jean-Baptiste Dubos observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses.\n\n\n"}

An individual \"lift\" transforms a local function into a global function. It is a two step process, consisting of;\n\nThe term \"lambda lifting\" was first introduced by Thomas Johnsson around 1982 and was historically considered as a mechanism for implementing functional programming languages. It is used in conjunction with other techniques in some modern compilers.\n\nLambda lifting is not the same as closure conversion. It requires all call sites to be adjusted (adding extra arguments to calls) and does not introduce a closure for the lifted lambda expression. In contrast, closure conversion does not require call sites to be adjusted but does introduce a closure for the lambda expression mapping free variables to values.\n\nThe technique may be used on individual functions, in code refactoring, to make a function usable outside the scope in which it was written. Lambda lifts may also be repeated, in order to transform the program. Repeated lifts may be used to convert a program written in lambda calculus into a set of recursive functions, without lambdas. This demonstrates the equivalence of programs written in lambda calculus and programs written as functions. However it does not demonstrate the soundness of lambda calculus for deduction, as the eta reduction used in lambda lifting is the step that introduces cardinality problems into the lambda calculus, because it removes the value from the variable, without first checking that there is only one value that satisfies the conditions on the variable (see Curry's paradox).\n\nLambda lifting is expensive on processing time for the compiler. An efficient implementation of lambda lifting is formula_1 on processing time for the compiler.\n\nIn the untyped lambda calculus, where the basic types are functions, lifting may change the result of beta reduction of a lambda expression. The resulting functions will have the same meaning, in a mathematical sense, but are not regarded as the same function in the untyped lambda calculus. See also intensional versus extensional equality.\n\nThe reverse operation to lambda lifting is lambda dropping.\n\nLambda dropping may make the compilation of programs quicker for the compiler, and may also increase the efficiency of the resulting program, by reducing the number of parameters, and reducing the size of stack frames.\nHowever it makes a function harder to re-use. A dropped function is tied to its context, and can only be used in a different context if it is first lifted.\n\nThe following algorithm is one way to lambda-lift an arbitrary program in a language which doesn't support closures as first-class objects:\n\nIf the language has closures as first-class objects that can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions, the closure will need to be represented by a data structure that captures the bindings of the free variables.\n\nThe following OCaml program computes the sum of the integers from 1 to 100:\nlet rec sum n =\nsum 100\n(The codice_1 declares codice_2 as a function that may call itself.) The function f, which adds sum's argument to the sum of the numbers less than the argument, is a local function. Within the definition of f, n is a free variable. Start by converting the free variable to a parameter:\nlet rec sum n =\nsum 100\nNext, lift f into a global function:\nlet rec f w x =\nand sum n =\nsum 100 \nThe following is the same example, this time written in JavaScript:\n// Initial version\n\nfunction sum(n) {\n\n// After converting the free variable n to a formal parameter w\n\nfunction sum(n) {\n\n// After lifting function f into the global scope\n\nfunction f(w, x) {\n\nfunction sum(n) {\n\nLambda lifting and closure are both methods for implementing block structured programs. It implements block structure by eliminating it. All functions are lifted to the global level. Closure conversion provides a \"closure\" which links the current frame to other frames. Closure conversion takes less compile time.\n\nRecursive functions, and block structured programs, with or without lifting, may be implemented using a stack based implementation, which is simple and efficient. However a stack frame based implementation must be strict (eager). The stack frame based implementation requires that the life of functions be last-in, first-out (LIFO). That is, the most recent function to start its calculation must be the first to end.\n\nSome functional languages (such as Haskell) are implemented using lazy evaluation, which delays calculation until the value is needed. The lazy implementation strategy gives flexibility to the programmer. Lazy evaluation requires delaying the call to a function until a request is made to the value calculated by the function. One implementation is to record a reference to a \"frame\" of data describing the calculation, in place of the value. Later when the value is required, the frame is used to calculate the value, just in time for when it is needed. The calculated value then replaces the reference.\n\nThe \"frame\" is similar to a stack frame, the difference being that it is not stored on the stack. Lazy evaluation requires that all the data required for the calculation be saved in the frame. If the function is \"lifted\", then the frame needs only record the function pointer, and the parameters to the function. Some modern languages use garbage collection in place of stack based allocation to manage the life of variables. In a managed, garbage collected environment, a closure records references to the frames from which values may be obtained. In contrast a lifted function has parameters for each value needed in the calculation.\n\nThe Let expression is useful in describing lifting and dropping, and in describing the relationship between recursive equations and lambda expressions. Most functional languages have let expressions. Also, block structured programming languages like ALGOL and Pascal are similar in that they too allow the local definition of a function for use in a restricted scope.\n\nThe \"let\" expression used here is a fully mutually recursive version of \"let rec\", as implemented in many functional languages.\n\nLet expressions are related to Lambda calculus. Lambda calculus has a simple syntax and semantics, and is good for describing Lambda lifting. It is convenient to describe lambda lifting as a translations from \"lambda\" to a \"let\" expression, and lambda dropping as the reverse. This is because \"let\" expressions allow mutual recursion, which is, in a sense, more lifted than is supported in lambda calculus. Lambda calculus does not support mutual recursion and only one function may be defined at the outermost global scope.\n\nConversion rules which describe translation without lifting are given in the Let expression article.\n\nThe following rules describe the equivalence of lambda and let expressions,\n\nMeta-functions will be given that describe lambda lifting and dropping. A meta-function is a function that takes a program as a parameter. The program is data for the meta-program. The program and the meta program are at different meta-levels.\n\nThe following conventions will be used to distinguish program from the meta program,\n\nFor simplicity the first rule given that matches will be applied. The rules also assume that the lambda expressions have been pre-processed so that each lambda abstraction has a unique name.\n\nThe substitution operator is used extensively. The expression formula_5 means substitute every occurrence of \"G\" in \"L\" by \"S\" and return the expression. The definition used is extended to cover the substitution of expressions, from the definition given on the Lambda calculus page. The matching of expressions should compare expressions for alpha equivalence (renaming of variables).\n\nEach lambda lift takes a lambda abstraction which is a sub expression of a lambda expression and replaces it by a function call (application) to a function that it creates. The free variables in the sub expression are the parameters to the function call.\n\nLambda lifts may be used on individual functions, in code refactoring, to make a function usable outside the scope in which it was written. Such lifts may also be repeated, until the expression has no lambda abstractions, in order to transform the program.\n\nA lift is given a sub-expression within an expression to lift to the top of that expression. The expression may be part of a larger program. This allows control of where the sub-expression is lifted to. The lambda lift operation used to perform a lift within a program is,\n\nThe sub expression may be either a lambda abstraction, or a lambda abstraction applied to a parameter.\n\nTwo types of lift are possible.\n\nAn anonymous lift has a lift expression which is a lambda abstraction only. It is regarded as defining an anonymous function. A name must be created for the function.\n\nA named lift expression has a lambda abstraction applied to an expression. This lift is regarded as a named definition of a function.\n\nAn anonymous lift takes a lambda abstraction (called \"S\"). For \"S\";\n\nThe lambda lift is the substitution of the lambda abstraction \"S\" for a function application, along with the addition of a definition for the function.\n\nThe new lambda expression has \"S\" substituted for G. Note that \"L[S:=G]\" means substitution of \"S\" for \"G\" in \"L\". The function definitions has the function definition \"G = S\" added.\n\nIn the above rule \"G\" is the function application that is substituted for the expression \"S\". It is defined by,\n\nwhere \"V\" is the function name. It must be a new variable, i.e. a name not already used in the lambda expression,\n\nwhere formula_10 is a meta function that returns the set of variables used in \"E\".\n\nThe function call \"G\" is constructed by adding parameters for each variable in the free variable set (represented by \"V\"), to the function \"H\",\n\nThe named lift is similar to the anonymous lift except that the function name \"V\" is provided.\n\nAs for the anonymous lift, the expression \"G\" is constructed from \"V\" by applying the free variables of \"S\". It is defined by,\n\nA lambda lift transformation takes a lambda expression and lifts all lambda abstractions to the top of the expression. The abstractions are then translated into recursive functions, which eliminates the lambda abstractions. The result is a functional program in the form,\n\nwhere \"M\" is a series of function definitions, and \"N\" is the expression representing the value returned.\n\nFor example,\n\nThe \"de-let\" meta function may then be used to convert the result back into lambda calculus.\n\nThe processing of transforming the lambda expression is a series of lifts. Each lift has,\n\nAfter the lifts are applied the lets are combined together into a single let.\n\nThen Parameter dropping is applied to remove parameters that are not necessary in the \"let\" expression. The let expression allows the function definitions to refer to each other directly, whereas lambda abstractions are strictly hierarchical, and a function may not directly refer to itself.\n\nThere are two different ways that an expression may be selected for lifting. The first treats all lambda abstractions as defining anonymous functions. The second, treats lambda abstractions which are applied to a parameter as defining a function. Lambda abstractions applied to a parameter have a dual interpretation as either a let expression defining a function, or as defining an anonymous function. Both interpretations are valid.\n\nThese two predicates are needed for both definitions.\n\n\"lambda-free\" - An expression containing no lambda abstractions.\n\n\"lambda-anon\" - An anonymous function. An expression like formula_21 where X is lambda free.\n\nSearch for the deepest anonymous abstraction, so that when the lift is applied the function lifted will become a simple equation. This definition does not recognize a lambda abstractions with a parameter as defining a function. All lambda abstractions are regarded as defining anonymous functions.\n\n\"lift-choice\" - The first anonymous found in traversing the expression or \"none\" if there is no function.\n\nFor example,\n\nSearch for the deepest named or anonymous function definition, so that when the lift is applied the function lifted will become a simple equation. This definition recognizes a lambda abstraction with an actual parameter as defining a function. Only lambda abstractions without an application are treated as anonymous functions.\n\n\n\nFor example,\n\nFor example, the Y combinator,\nis lifted as,\nand after Parameter dropping,\nAs a lambda expression (see Conversion from let to lambda expressions),\n\nIf lifting anonymous functions only, the Y combinator is,\nand after Parameter dropping,\nAs a lambda expression,\n\nThe first sub expression to be chosen for lifting is formula_42. This transforms the lambda expression into formula_43 and creates the equation formula_44.\n\nThe second sub expression to be chosen for lifting is formula_45. This transforms the lambda expression into formula_46 and creates the equation formula_47.\n\nAnd the result is,\n\nSurprisingly this result is simpler than the one obtained from lifting named functions.\n\nApply function to ,\n\nSo,\nor\n\nThe Y-Combinator calls its parameter (function) repeatedly on itself. The value is defined if the function has a fixed point. But the function will never terminate.\n\nLambda dropping is making the scope of functions smaller and using the context from the reduced scope to reduce the number of parameters to functions. Reducing the number of parameters makes functions easier to comprehend.\n\nIn the Lambda lifting section, a meta function for first lifting and then converting the resulting lambda expression into recursive equation was described. The Lambda Drop meta function performs the reverse by first converting recursive equations to lambda abstractions, and then dropping the resulting lambda expression, into the smallest scope which covers all references to the lambda abstraction.\n\nLambda dropping is performed in two steps,\n\nA Lambda drop is applied to an expression which is part of a program. Dropping is controlled by a set of expressions from which the drop will be excluded.\n\nwhere,\n\nThe lambda drop transformation sinks all abstractions in an expression. Sinking is excluded from expressions in a set of expressions,\nwhere,\n\n\"sink-tran\" sinks each abstraction, starting from the innermost,\n\nSinking is moving a lambda abstraction inwards as far as possible such that it is still outside all references to the variable.\n\nApplication - 4 cases.\n\nAbstraction. Use renaming to insure that the variable names are all distinct.\n\nVariable - 2 cases.\n\nSink test excludes expressions from dropping,\n\nParameter dropping is optimizing a function for its position in the function. Lambda lifting added parameters that were necessary so that a function can be moved out of its context. In dropping, this process is reversed, and extra parameters that contain variables that are free may be removed.\n\nDropping a parameter is removing an unnecessary parameter from a function, where the actual parameter being passed in is always the same expression. The free variables of the expression must also be free where the function is defined. In this case the parameter that is dropped is replaced by the expression in the body of the function definition. This makes the parameter unnecessary.\n\nFor example, consider,\n\nIn this example the actual parameter for the formal parameter \"o\" is always \"p\". As \"p\" is a free variable in the whole expression, the parameter may be dropped. The actual parameter for the formal parameter \"y\" is always \"n\". However \"n\" is bound in a lambda abstraction. So this parameter may not be dropped.\n\nThe result of dropping the parameter is,\n\nFor the main example,\n\nThe definition of \"drop-params-tran\" is,\n\nwhere,\n\nFor each abstraction that defines a function, build the information required to make decisions on dropping names. This information describes each parameter; the parameter name, the expression for the actual value, and an indication that all the expressions have the same value.\n\nFor example, in,\n\nthe parameters to the function \"g\" are,\n\nEach abstraction is renamed with a unique name, and the parameter list is associated with the name of the abstraction. For example, \"g\" there is parameter list. \n\n\"build-param-lists\" builds all the lists for an expression, by traversing the expression. It has four parameters;\n\nAbstraction - A lambda expression of the form formula_70 is analyzed to extract the names of parameters for the function.\n\nLocate the name and start building the parameter list for the name, filling in the formal parameter names. Also receive any actual parameter list from the body of the expression, and return it as the actual parameter list from this expression\n\nVariable - A call to a function.\n\nFor a function name or parameter start populating actual parameter list by outputting the parameter list for this name.\n\nApplication - An application (function call) is processed to extract actual parameter details.\n\nRetrieve the parameter lists for the expression, and the parameter. Retrieve a parameter record from the parameter list from the expression, and check that the current parameter value matches this parameter. Record the value for the parameter name for use later in checking.\n\nThe above logic is quite subtle in the way that it works. The same value indicator is never set to true. It is only set to false if all the values cannot be matched. The value is retrieved by using \"S\" to build a set of the Boolean values allowed for \"S\". If true is a member then all the values for this parameter are equal, and the parameter may be dropped.\n\nSimilarly, \"def\" uses set theory to query if a variable has been given a value;\n\nLet - Let expression.\n\nAnd - For use in \"let\".\n\nFor example, building the parameter lists for,\ngives,\nand the parameter o is dropped to give,\n\nAnother example is,\nHere x is equal to f. The parameter list mapping is,\nand the parameter x is dropped to give,\n\nUse the information obtained by Build parameter lists to drop actual parameters that are no longer required. \"drop-params\" has the parameters,\n\nAbstraction\n\nwhere,\n\nwhere,\n\nVariable\n\nFor a function name or parameter start populating actual parameter list by outputting the parameter list for this name.\n\nApplication - An application (function call) is processed to extract\n\nLet - Let expression.\n\nAnd - For use in \"let\".\n\n\"drop-formal\" removes formal parameters, based on the contents of the drop lists. Its parameters are,\n\n\"drop-formal\" is defined as,\n\nWhich can be explained as,\n\nStarting with the function definition of the Y-combinator,\n\nWhich gives back the [[Fixed-point combinator|Y combinator]],\n\n\n\n[[Category:Implementation of functional programming languages]]\n[[Category:Lambda calculus]]\n[[Category:Compiler construction]]"}

{"id": "2230365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230365", "title": "Massacration", "text": "Massacration\n\nMassacration is a Brazilian satirical heavy metal band, self-proclaimed the \"greatest and most classic heavy metal band, the inspiration behind most heavy bands since 1985, whose members' hairdos and posing influenced the whole heavy metal culture\". The classical line-up consists of Detonator (vocal, Bruno Sutter), Blondie Hammet (lead guitar, Fausto Fanti), Metal Avenger (bass guitar, Marco Antônio Alves), Jimmy \"The Hammer\" (drums, Felipe Torres) and Headmaster (rhythm guitar, Adriano Pereira).\n\nMassacration was created in the sketch comedy show \"Hermes & Renato\" along with other fake bands such as the indietronica \"Também Sou Hype\" (\"I'm Also Hype\", a parody of CSS), samba school \"Unidos do Caralho a Quatro\" or the axé band \"Coração Melão\" (Melon Heart). But, like The Monkees, Massacration became a huge success, and a real band.\n\nAccording to a mockumentary shown in MTV (parodying their own Rockumentary format) in December 2004, the band began in 1979, when a young delinquent called John Hammet (Blondie Hammet) was directed to the juvenile hall for the sixth time. There, Hammet played guitar as his only hobby, thus bringing the attention of David Sutter (Bruno Sutter Detonator), committed for trafficking quails. They had become very close friends. After being released from detention, they approached Donald Polai and formed a band called Death Mania (which seemed to be more like a jam band, seeing as there was no bassist or drummer - Polai played tambourine). Unfortunately, the band lasted nothing but a couple of minutes after their first gig when Polai, influenced by the name, committed suicide.\n\nHammet and Sutter, depressed over the loss, became addicted to pasta from a ristorante named \"Massas Crezio\" (Crezio's Pasta, named after Crezio, the young owner of the establishment), and ate so much of his food they wound up going 100 pounds overweight. Crezio intervened, conceding them a space in his property so that Hammet and Sutter could rehearse, which made them overcome their depression and lose all the weight they had gained. In order to reform the band, they decided to put an ad in a local newspaper looking for a drummer, a rhythm guitarist and a bassist. The three candidates who filled these spots were, respectively, Jimmy \"The Hammer\" Lombardo, Klaus Bisonnette (Headmaster) and Rick Banday (Metal Avenger). Coincidentally enough, all three of them worked with Crezio. The band was formed again. In order to pay homage to Crezio and his pivotal role on getting the band back together (also because his business sponsored the band), the band was rebaptized as MASSASCREZIO. The cacophonic name later on suffered a series of mutations: MASSACREZIO, MASSACRETION, and finally MASSACRATION .\n\nRight after their first gig as Massacration, they had already hooked up with Dick Dornelle, a famed record producer who had worked with the likes of Queen, Iron Maiden and Michael Jackson. With Dornelle, the band had signed with a label called Shusi Records and, even without any recorded material, their popularity had skyrocketed in but a matter of hours. Only then would they go on to record their first single, \"Metal Massacre Attack\", whose recording sessions lasted two whole months in a studio in North Carolina. \"Metal Massacre Attack\" consolidated their success by debuting at number one on \"Billboard\" Hot 100, anachronistically in front of contemporary names like Usher, Maroon 5 and Gavin DeGraw, and earning the band a \"Gremlin\".\n\nOne day however, Detonator, reduced to a pauper, knocked the door to Hammet's house. They instantly recognized themselves and the reunion brought about a maelstrom of emotions. Clean from his addiction, Detonator was readmitted into the band, making the three remaining members change their minds about taking their old jobs back. As their comeback act, the band promptly released their second single, \"Metal Bucetation\", which rose them to the top again due to its lightning-quick selling - there were even riots because there were relatively too few singles for too many people. Trailing this success came \"Metal Milk Shake\", their third single, that sold 12 billion copies, certifying them with a sixfold diamond record (actually, by RIAA standards, such a mark is equivalent to 1,200 diamond records), as well as helping Massacration be heralded with the Nobel Prize in Music, which had only been awarded to Mozart, Beethoven and Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe band was idealized by and composed of members of the Brazilian comedy act Hermes & Renato (currently known as \"Banana Mecânica\" - \"Clockwork Banana\") that aired on MTV in 2002, in a trash horror movie-like segment that showed a youngster who bought a Massacration record and, by playing it backwards, triggered a curse that, ultimately, turned back against him. After this segment, an \"exclusive interview\" with the five band members and then, the video premiere for \"Metal Massacre Attack\", were aired. In these segments, the name of the band did not have the present spelling: it read \"Masacretion\" on the record cover, and \"Massacrassion\" in the interview sketch.\n\nAfter the making of the song (and video) \"Metal Massacre Attack\", the video began airing not only on the \"Hermes e Renato\" comedy show, but also on the MTV regular rotation videos. The promo video was such a success that the crew was forced to make more songs and videos. \"Metal Bucetation\" followed \"Metal Massacre Attack\".\n\nIn 2005 they finally finished their first album, \"Gates of Metal Fried Chicken of Death\", produced by João Gordo, lead singer of Ratos de Porão, a reputed hardcore punk Brazilian band. The first single was \"Metal is the Law\". Because Jimmy \"The Hammer\" and Headmaster are not real musicians, Igor Cavalera recorded the drums and Blondie Hammet recorded all the guitars.\n\nThey have been requested to perform live their songs, and have so far appeared in the Abril Pro Rock Festival and Brasil Metal Union (the latter an all-heavy metal festival). Most of the humour effect of the band relies on its use of a fake English (mocking the fact that many Brazilians prefer foreign music despite being unable to understand it), exaggerate posing, outrageous clothes and gear.\n\nThe success they achieved was so high, they even have their own MTV show, where only heavy metal videos are broadcast (which, to some, is surprising, considering the pop-oriented nature of MTV).\n\nIt is rumored that their tour drummer is Cavalera Conspiracy's Igor Cavalera. Massacration actually opened some venues for Sepultura during the course of 2005, and Cavalera actually played with them in some venues, under the alias \"El Covero\" (Spanish for \"the gravedigger\").\n\nMassacration debuted in 2006 in Rockgol, a Brazilian MTV show, in the Pirulândia team, along with Supla, Falamansa, Sonic Jr. and Lucas Santtana.\n\nIn 2009, the follow-up album, \"Good Blood Headbanguers\", was released (\"Good Blood\" being a literal translation of the Brazilian expression \"sangue bom\", meaning a nice, trustworthy person). By this time, the band's aesthetics has leaned more towards glam metal (notably in the power ballad \"The Bull\", about a man who was cheated on by his girlfriend) while generally retaining its traditional metal sound. As another highlight, the album was produced by Roy Z, well known for his work as guitarist in Rob Halford's solo project and as producer with many other bands and artists such as Bruce Dickinson.\n\nIn July 30 of 2014, Fausto Fanti (Blondie Hammett) was found dead in his apartment. He hanged himself with a belt.\n\nIn May 20 of 2016 Massacration reunited and released a new song called \"Grand Pedido\" to promote the return of McDonald's Grand Big Mac hamburger, which uses elements of rock and heavy metal as main concept. In December 20 of 2016, Massacration's comeback was officialized, with the release of a new single, \"Metal Milf\".\n\nMassacration chiefly satirises Manowar, Angra, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, with minor references to Sepultura, Saxon, Black Sabbath and Viking metal in general. Their main targets are the Brazilian heavy/power metal fans who can't speak English but nevertheless love the genre, the Brazilian groups who sing in English (like Angra, Dr. Sin, Sepultura, Viper and others) and the heavy metal culture in general, with its leather jackets, black clothes, long hair and frowns. The very fact that the Brazilian headbangers laughed at their jokes and even embraced their music.\n\nRegarding their lyrics, they are intentionally written in a very broken English (which may be unintelligible in a native speaker's ears) mixed with \"embromation\" (macaronic words formed by the addition of typical English suffixes like \"-ation\", \"-atic\", \"-ful\", \"-ness\" and others to Portuguese roots). Sometimes entire sentences or stanzas can be in Brazilian Portuguese—and not gibberish, unlike some foreigners believe. For instance, the introduction of \"Metal is the Law\" includes the lines: \"ai, ai, ai, ai,/ em cima, embaixo/e puxa e vai\", which are verses taken from a 'marchinha de Carnaval' (Carnival song) known nationwide and would translate to \"ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh/above, below/pull and go\". Also, some words whose translation would not be known are thrown in the lyrics in Portuguese, like the first verse of \"Metal Dental Destruction\", which says \"\"fear of the killing broca...\"\", in which \"broca\" refers to a dental drill.\n\nThe overall image of the band, their subjects and the recurrent terminology suggest a heavy influence of Manowar (and Judas Priest as well, especially when it comes to their image of leather-clad headbangers). However, while most of their songs have names that suggest violence, death, sorrow and sacrilege, they are actually always light-hearted, humorous and naïve, pointing to a joyride lifestyle instead of the gloomy atmosphere of actual heavy metal records.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It became a full assembly. These are not considered general elections, as there was no dissolution of the assembly.

He was a founding member of the 1960s rock group John's Children, and a member of several other bands, including Jook, Jet and Radio Stars. He replaced The Who's Keith Moon on drums on a 1967 UK tour after Moon had injured himself, and he jammed with Jimi Hendrix at the Speakeasy rock club in London. Later in his life Townson quit the music business and became an illustrator and a highly respected social worker.\n\nChris Townson was born in Battersea, London on 24 July 1947. He was abandoned by his parents at the age of four, and spent his early childhood in foster care. In 1958, after passing the entrance exam, the London County Council sent Townson to the Stoatley Rough School in Haslemere, Surrey, where he was resident for two years. In the early 1960s, Townson attended Box Hill School, also in Surrey, and there he met Andy Ellison. Notwithstanding the Beatlemania that was sweeping the country at the time, Townson and Ellison were more interested in the rhythm and blues sound of The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds and The Who. When Townson saw The Who perform, he said in a magazine interview some years later, \"that was it, it was this that I wanted to do!\"\n\nIn 1965 Townson and Ellison formed a band called the Clockwork Onions, which later became The Few, and then The Silence. The band was Townson (drums), Ellison (vocals), Geoff McClelland (guitar) and John Hewlett (bass guitar). Townson invited The Yardbirds' manager Simon Napier-Bell to see The Silence perform, and while Napier-Bell thought they were \"dreadful\", he was impressed by their antics and agreed to manage them. He changed the group's name to John's Children and said they should make their act \"as outrageous as possible\" to attract the attention of the press. The band was named after their bass player because he played so badly and Napier-Bell wanted to be sure the band would not fire him. In March 1967 Marc Bolan joined John's Children and Napier-Bell signed them with Track Records, which included artists like The Who and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. John's Children released several singles, including \"Desdemona\", which was banned by the BBC because of its lyrics. Their live act, according to Townson, was \"theatre\", \"anarchy\" and \"deconstruction\". They fought each other on stage, used chains, fake blood and feathers, and they trashed their instruments. In general the band \"whip[ped] the audience into a frenzy\".\n\nIn April 1967 John's Children went on a tour of Germany with The Who, also notorious for their own wild stage performances. But John's Children were sent home early because they \"upstaged\" The Who, and their act in Ludwigshafen caused a riot in the audience, which nearly prevented The Who from playing. A few months later, however, The Who called on Townson's services when their drummer Keith Moon had injured himself demolishing his own drum kit on stage. Townson drummed with The Who, his \"all time favourite band\", in four of their concerts in June 1967. But The Who got their revenge on Townson for John's Children's \"reckless behaviour\" on the German tour: at the end of his last gig with them, they \"blew [him] off the stage\" with flash powder.\n\nJohn's Children split up in late 1967 after only 18 months, but in that short period of time they had achieved a \"cult status\". Townson played in several groups after John's Children, including Jook, Jet and Radio Stars. In the late 1970s Townson quit the music business and built a successful career illustrating album covers and books. Later, and for health reasons, he studied to be a social worker, and worked with the National Children's Home, becoming director of its Phoenix Project. It was Townson's own difficult childhood and the help he had received from social workers at the time that gave him an \"innate understanding\" of the children's circumstances.\n\nTownson rejoined John's Children when they reformed in the late 1990s for the occasional tour, and recorded a single with them in 2006. He also played on all of (former Jet member) Martin Gordon's solo albums, and also illustrated a book which accompanied one of them, entitled \"The Illustrated and Annotated 'God's on His Lunchbreak, Please Call Back' Companion Volume\".\n\nTownson died of cancer in London on 10 February 2008. He was married twice with one son and four daughters.\n"}
{"id": "2230386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230386", "title": "Jeonse", "text": "Jeonse\n\nJeonse (), also known as Chonsei, Key Money Deposit or Key Money, is a real estate term unique to South Korea that refers to the way apartments are leased. Instead of paying monthly rent, a renter will make a lump-sum deposit on a rental space, at anywhere from 50% to 80% of the market value.\n\nJeonse involves the tenant giving the landlord a large sum of \"key money\" when a lease is signed. The amount of money required depends on the economy and the location of the property. Usually the amount required is 50% of the property's value, but can be as high as 60-80%.\n\nIn 2014, it was reported that the average cost of a Jeonse in Seoul equals to almost $300,000 USD.\n\nThe tenant is then allowed to stay in the property \"rent-free\", not requiring any additional monthly payments, until the end of the lease, which is usually 2 years. Utilities and other costs (water, gas, electricity, cable, phone, internet, security) are applied for and paid by the tenant.\n\nThe landlord makes a return by taking the deposit money and investing it and keeping all interest earned on the deposit. The tenant's deposit is protected by having a lien issued against the property for the amount given. The entire deposit is then returned to the tenant at the end of the lease.\n\nIn rare cases where damage has been done to the property, the damage has to be fixed to the landlord's standard before a landlord will return the deposit.\n\nThis system is popular for two main reasons. First, there are very few mortgages in South Korea , so it is difficult for consumers to own a home. Also, real estate prices continue to increase so fast that some see the situation as a housing bubble.\n\nDuring times of lower interest rates, (월세), or monthly rent, is more often used. With a lease, a renter signs a lease for 1 or 2 years and makes a deposit on the apartment equal to perhaps 10% of the market value. The renter then pays monthly rent.\n\nAs Jeonse tenants are not obligated to pay any monthly rent, it may lead them to believe that Jeonse is a great deal in all aspects. However, there is a certain level of risks of which the tenants shall be aware for leasing an apartment by Jeonse.\n\nJeonse tenants are taking a short position in the housing market in some sense. When the apartment price goes down the amount of Jeonse deposit goes down proportionally, although this may not always be the case. In such circumstances, the tenants will get the difference back when they renew the lease, at least in theory. However, if their landlords fail to provide the difference either with their own money or by taking a loan, the tenants are left with a few difficult options such as a lawsuit. On the other hand, when the apartment price goes up the deposit may go up as well, and the tenants shall fill the gap when they renew the lease.\n\nIt is a common practice that Jeonse tenants have the deposit ready by taking a loan from a bank due to the sheer amount of the deposit. If they take a loan with a variable annual percentage rate (APR), which is fairly common, they are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates. However, banks are able to provide a very low APR (2-4%) as the deposit may be taken as a collateral.\n\nSome landlords may have a large amount of overdue taxes. In such cases, the government may put the apartment up for auction in an attempt to collect the overdue taxes. When the apartment is sold, the government collects the overdue from the profits from the auction. Since national tax (국세) and local tax (지방세) take a higher priority than the tenants, they may lose some or all of their deposit, depending on how much their landlords owes the government.\n\n\n"}

The Saltdogs are in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. Since the 2001 season, the Saltdogs have played their home games at Haymarket Park, which they share with the Nebraska Cornhuskers college baseball team.\n\nThe Saltdogs were formed when the Madison Black Wolf were sold and moved to Lincoln after the 2000 season. The team was a member of the Northern League from 2001 to 2005. After the 2005 season, the Saltdogs (along with the St. Paul Saints, Sioux City Explorers and Sioux Falls Canaries) left the Northern League to form the American Association.\n\nThe Saltdogs claimed their first-ever league title in 2009, winning the American Association Championship. Their overall regular-season record was 49-47, but Lincoln went 27-21 to claim the second-half North Division title, and advanced to the championship by defeating the first-half North champ Wichita Wingnuts in the division series, three games to two. The Saltdogs then claimed the title by defeating the South Division champion Pensacola Pelicans three games to two, with Game Five decided by a 2-1 score at Pelican Park in Pensacola.\n\nLincoln celebrated Season Ten of Saltdogs baseball in 2010, and the team responded with its fourth berth in the playoffs over the past five seasons. The Saltdogs finished with a 51-45 overall record, the seventh time in ten years Lincoln reached the 50-win plateau, and the ninth time in ten seasons that the team finished above the .500 mark. Although the Saltdogs did not win a division title in 2010, their overall record was still good enough for them to qualify for the postseason via a wild card berth. Lincoln has earned four wild-card playoff berths in its history, with the first three (2001, 2002, 2005) coming during the team's Northern League days.\n\nThe Saltdogs made the playoffs in each of their first two years in the American Association. In both 2006 and 2007, they finished with the league's best overall regular-season record, winning three of the four North Division titles (both the 1st-half and 2nd-half titles in 2006, and the 1st-half title in 2007). Their 14-game winning streak in 2007 is the longest in team history. The Saltdogs have the best overall record (272-204) of any team in the five-year history of the American Association.\n\nKash Beauchamp was the first manager in Saltdogs history, although his tenure lasted just 42 games into the 2001 season, during which the team went 21-21 (.500). Pitcher Les Lancaster replaced Beauchamp, guiding Lincoln to playoff berths in both 2001 and 2002. Lancaster served as a player-manager for the first ten days of his managing tenure before moving exclusively to the bench. He posted a regular-season record of 86-53 (.619), and a postseason record of 6-7. After the 2002 season, Lancaster departed and was replaced by former Toronto Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson. Johnson spent six seasons with the Saltdogs, compiling a 314-252 (.555) regular-season record and a 2-9 postseason record. Lincoln made the playoffs three times under Johnson (2005, 2006, 2007) and won three division championships (American Association 2006 first-half and second-half North Division titles, 2007 first-half North Division title). Johnson resigned as manager at the end of the 2008 season, and was replaced by Marty Scott, who had managed the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs during the '08 season. Scott won two championships between 1995 and 2000 as the manager of the St. Paul Saints, and guided Lincoln to the 2009 championship, his fourth overall as a manager. Over his two seasons in Lincoln, Scott has compiled a 100-92 (.521) regular-season record, and a 6-7 postseason record.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230412", "title": "Empty calories", "text": "Empty calories\n\nIn human nutrition, the term empty calories applies to foods and beverages composed primarily or solely of sugar, fats or oils, or alcohol-containing beverages. These supply food energy but little to no other nutrition in the way of vitamins, minerals, protein, fibre, or essential fatty acids. Fat contributes nine calories per gram, ethanol seven calories, sugar four calories. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advises, \"A small amount of empty calories is okay, but most people eat far more than is healthy.\" The phrase is derived from low nutrient density, which is the proportion of nutrients in a food relative to its energy content. \n\nConsidering energy foods as adequate nutrition was first scientifically demonstrated to be false by François Magendie by experiments on dogs and described in his \"Précis élémentaire de Physiologie\". He showed that eating only sugar, olive oil, or butter, each led to the death of his test animals in 30 to 40 days.\n\nThe following foods are often considered to contain mostly empty calories and may lead to weight gain:\n\nThe 'empty calories' argument is that a diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients. One review reported that for increases in consumption of added sugars, nutrients at most risk for inadequacy were vitamins E, A, C, and magnesium. For these, nutrient intake was less with each 5% increase in added sugars intake. \n\nA diet high in alcohol can have the same effect. According to one review, \"Micronutrient deficiencies occur in patients with ALD (alcoholic liver disease) because the major proportion of calories derived from alcohol lack minerals and vitamins. Specific emphasis is necessary for zinc, vitamin D, thiamine, folate, cyanocobalamin, and selenium.\" People with ALD also display sarcopenia - muscle wasting - but it is not clear if this is due to chronic low protein intake or the disease, which is known to inhibit muscle protein synthesis.\n\nFood energy intake must be balanced with activity to maintain a proper body weight. Sedentary individuals and those eating less to lose weight may suffer malnutrition if they eat food supplying empty calories but not enough nutrients. In contrast, people who engage in heavy physical activity need more food energy as fuel, and so can have a larger amount of calorie-rich, essential nutrient-poor foods. Dietitians and other healthcare professionals prevent malnutrition by designing eating programs and recommending dietary modifications according to patient's needs.\n\nThe USDA advises the following levels of empty calorie consumption as an upper limit for individuals who engage in 30 minutes or less of moderate exercise daily.\n\n"}

He first appeared in \"Super Friends\" #7. His first canon appearance is \"Infinity, Inc.\" #32 (November 1986).\n\nHe is unrelated to the Looney Tunes character, although both characters are owned by divisions of WarnerMedia.\n\nHugh Dawkins is a born metahuman with the ability to turn into a supernaturally large and intelligent Tasmanian Devil, in a fashion similar to a werewolf. An alternate origin has jokingly been offered, claiming that Hugh's mother was a were-Tasmanian Devil who raised him in a Tasmanian Devil cult, which gave him a Tasmanian Devil amulet after selling his soul to a Tasmanian Devil and injecting him with a radioactive Tasmanian Devil musk from a race of alien Tasmanian Devils which gave him his powers. While Hugh is a pacifist, his alter ego of the Tasmanian Devil is aggressive and bestial. His parents had a hard time with him until he saved his father's life.\n\nHe works as a superhero in Tasmania until he is contacted by a man named Doctor Mist to join the Global Guardians. He fights alongside the team and other heroes. In one incident, a teamup with Infinity Inc. goes bad when Taz is mentally forced to help a murderous villain gain revenge on a casino. Later, the Guardians' base is destroyed and the team disbands.\n\nDawkins helps to rebuild the Justice League Embassy which had been destroyed during an alien invasion. His affiliation with the Justice League causes his rejection by the Queen Bee, ruler of Bialya, who is reforming the Guardians. Her efforts seem beneficial but are for her own selfish gain, as she is using brainwashing techniques to put the Guardians under her control. This affects the Devil again, as his close friend Tuatara falls into a coma after destroying a neo-Nazi compound and attacking the League. Tuatara receives care by an Australian medical facility.\n\nDawkins and his friend Joshua Barbazon are preparing the Justice League Australian embassy. Their plans include transferring Tuatara to the medical lab, as soon as it is completed. The Queen Bee recalls Tuatara before this happens. Dawkins is infuriated by these circumstances, which he doesn't fully understand.\n\nDawkins would be there when Tuatara recovers his true mind. Called up in a League effort to stop an international incident, Dawkins and many other League members travel to Bialya. It turns out that Captain Atom, Elongated Man, Ice and Blue Beetle had been fired by Ambassador Heimlich, a mole placed into UN power by the Queen Bee. They had illegally invaded Bialya to investigate.\n\nThe backup team enters, with the permission of Queen Bee, just in time to be caught in a devastating explosion, which destroys an entire city block. The League and many innocent people are saved by Ice creating a shield, but so many others are not so lucky. Dawkin's former friends regain their minds, and the Bee's massive brainwashing efforts are uncovered. He also learns that Doctor Mist was a robot, Jack O'Lantern is dead but an impostor, and Owlwoman is missing. It is said that Little Mermaid is also missing, though both sides in the conflict had seen her die from a misfired shot by Lantern. Queen Bee, the one that has caused so much problems is deposed and slain by Sumaan Harjavti, the brother of the man the Queen had slain and deposed.\n\nDawkins and the League help with relief and recovery efforts. After this he would return to Australia, but he rejoins a team of Guardians to rescue those still endangered by the secret machinations of Harjavti. The entire group is endangered as those left behind had been implanted with subliminal orders to kill. Fortunately, nobody is actually harmed and the Guardians are reformed again. Taz assists with clean up efforts after Coast City is obliterated.\n\nHe rejoins Justice League International after aiding them against the villain Sonar. He is present for the funeral of fellow Leaguer Ice. He becomes indirectly involved in another recruitment effort but it doesn't work out.\n\nIt is also revealed that Hugh is openly gay in \"Justice League Quarterly\" #8 (1992). He has previously been romantically interested in JLA liaison Joshua Barbizon, had a crush on Hal Jordan and is dating Starman, Mikaal Thomas.\n\nLater, Dawkins works with the Justice League during the Bloodlines event. He teams up, mainly with Elongated Man and Metamorpho to stop a group of murderous aliens terrorizing London. The other adult female team members, Power Girl and Doctor Light, are unavailable to assist due to previous commitments. The men are not very successful as dozens of citizens vanish or are killed. The toll, which includes a missing school bus, deeply affects all three. During one investigation, they are attacked by the rookie armored hero Lionheart, who mistakes Taz's unusual form (and the changing forms of his friends) for the eyewitness reports of the aliens.\n\nThe aliens attack the League's headquarters, a (seemingly haunted) castle. Summoned by the energy flares of their youngest member, Maya, the group returns and fights the creatures. Lionheart, though his secondary mission is to discredit the League, sees the nobility in Taz and the others and helps them chase off the aliens. No pursuit is possible, as all are injured; Taz himself has been impaled through the shoulder. Lionheart, before fainting from his injuries, summons medical help through an emergency Justice League communications channel. Taz recovers in time to help his JLE teammates and dozens of other heroes defeat the Bloodlines aliens. The aliens are destroyed in a swamp outside of Metropolis in America.\n\nAround this time, Dawkins goes on a JLI goodwill tour to New Zealand. They resist him at first. He and his contact, Raylene Mackenzie, stumble upon the villain Phobia and Tas literally sniffs out one of her recent murders. The two get into a back-and-forth fight with the fear-casting killer. Raylene confronts a fear of drowning, while Tas' hallucination concerns the abusive treatment his mother heaped upon his father. Working together, the two defeat Phobia. Tas' efforts to save a New Zealander endears him to the entire country.\n\nDawkins later assists the Justice League in battling Overmaster. There, the team loses Ice. The group falls apart, and Dawkins soon leaves too, not wanting to stay in a group so small and unestablished. He does not see the point.\n\nTas is one of the mourners at the funeral for Maxwell Lord. After some time missing, he is shown attending the funeral of Sue Dibny, wife of the Elongated Man.\n\nHe joins the Ultramarine Corps and lives for a time on their floating city of Superbia. When the entire city is conquered by Gorilla Grodd and his forces, Tas and the other surviving heroes are sent to cause destruction. His mind and the Corps are rescued by the Justice League. Soon after, he takes part in the Corps' mission into the infant universe sometimes known as Nebula Man. Their efforts later allow the villain to be destroyed.\n\nTas helps out in the OMAC Crisis. He is one of many superheroes who go to the Sahara as bait for the legions of meta-human killing machines. This scheme works, and many OMACs are destroyed without harming the hosts within.\n\nAfter the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", Tas is shown at a memorial service/headcount. During the \"52\" maxi-series, Tas and other powered beings, including Gloss and Manticore, face a rage-maddened Black Adam in Sydney, Australia. They are shown unconscious and buried in debris.\n\nLater, Tas once again rejoins the Global Guardians.\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #852 (2008), Tas makes a brief appearance fighting hostile gunmen on the streets of Australia.\n\nIn the 2009 mini-series \"\", it is revealed that Tas was skinned, and his pelt was made into a rug by the villain Prometheus.\n\nIn the 2011 \"Starman/Congorilla\" one-shot, it is revealed that Prometheus had his body put into a stasis pod. He was fully healed and awakened after a citizen of Gorilla City named Malavar placed his comatose body in a Lazarus Pit. He rises from the Pit just in time to help Starman, Congorilla, Malavar and Animal Man fight a group of enemies, and then returns to Australia to tell his mother that he is still alive.\n\nFollowing his resurrection, Tas appears as a member of the Justice League's reserve roster during the battle against Eclipso's shadow army.\n\nIn \"Midnighter and Apollo\" it is implied he is not only resurrected but married to Gregorio de la Vega, who refers to his husband as a therianthrope and named Hugh.\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock,\" Tasmanian Devil is listed as a member of the Australian superhero team called the Sleeping Soldiers.\n\nHugh Dawkins can turn into a large Tasmanian devil. In this form, he has super strength, savage claws, healing factor and razor sharp fangs.\n\n"}

It is part of the presidential palace compound which has a total area of 68,000 m², along with three other buildings: Bina Graha that was formerly used as the President's Office, Wisma Negara in the western side which is used as state guest house, and the office for the Ministry of State Secretariat of Indonesia. Istana Negara faces north towards aforementioned street, while the Merdeka Palace faces Merdeka Square and the National Monument (Monas).\n\nConstruction of the building started in 1796. It was built by Jacob Andries van Braam, a Dutchman who between 1810 and 1819 held several high positions in government, to be made his own residence. It was an elegant two-floored building designed in Indies Empire style, a popular style of architecture during the late 18th-century. The building was built in the neighborhood of Rijswijk-Molenvliet (present \"Harmoni\"), which was among the most exclusive neighborhood in Batavia's \"Bovenstad\" (\"uptown\") at that time. The building was built during the tenure of Governor General Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten, shortly after the completion of another lavish residence which later would become Hotel der Nederlanden. Construction took several years, and the building was finally completed in 1804.\n\nUpon the completion of the building, the building was handed over to Hugh Hope, then the British Commissioner when the country under the British rule. Van Braam lived in a smaller wing to the south of the building throughout his life. \n\nAfter the death of J.A. van Braam, the house was brought over by the Dutch Government in 1816. The government used this building as the center of all administration and as the official residence of the Governor-General during a stay in Batavia. The much larger building that was intended by Daendels to become the official residence of the governor-general of the Dutch Indies in Waterlooplein was delayed, and so it was never used as a residence for the governor-general, even after its completion in 1828. As the official residence of the governor-general, van Braam's residence was officially named \"Hotel van den Gouverneur-Generaal\" (Hotel of the Governor-General).\n\nImportant occasions such as formal ceremonies or the Indies Council Meeting on every Wednesday were held in the palace. Godert van der Capellen became the first governor-general to officially reside in the palace in 1820. However Bogor Palace (Paleis te Buitenzorg) in Bogor (Buitenzorg) became the main residence, as most of the governor generals preferred the temperate climate in the hillsides of Bogor.\n\nIn 1848, the first floor of the building was removed and the room which faced the Koningsplein was redesigned to be more open to the exterior.\n\nLater the palace became too cramped with increasing administrative need, and thus a new palace was planned in 1869. The new palace was completed in 1873 facing Koningsplein (King's Square) and it would be known as Koningsplein Palace. Together the palace would form the Governor-General's palace compound in Rijswijk.\n\nIn 1875, the complex was equipped with new iron fencing. Additional houses were built to accommodate the officials of the Palace.\n\nIn 1942, the Japanese successfully invaded the Dutch East Indies. Governor-General Tjarda Van Starkenborch signed a capitulation to the Japanese army in the palace on 8 March 1942. Under the Japanese, the palace became the residence of the \"Saiko Shikikan\" (army commander) until the Japanese surrender in 1945. After the independence, the lion emblem of the Netherlands on the front facade of the building was removed.\n\nSince its existence, many important events took place in this building. Some of which include the declaration of the \"cultuur stelsel\" system by the Governor-General Graaf van den Bosch, the ratification ceremony of the Linggadjati Agreement on 25 March 1947 and the recognition of Indonesia's independence on 27 December 1949.\n\nThe architecture of the Merdeka Palace was done in a style known as the Indies Empire style, a popular style of architecture in the early 19th-century Batavia. During the early days, the 3.375 m² building had two stories. In 1848, the upper floor was partly demolished, and the lower expanded to accommodate more individuals, and thus present a more formal portrayal. The palace mainly functions as the main venue for stately ceremonial activities such as appointments of ministers, conference and national meeting opening ceremonies, the opening of international and national congresses, national banquets and cultural performances. It also serves as an administrative office for the Head of state.\n\nThe front part of the palace contains the main reception hall, which is used mainly for Gifts of State exchanges and is located next to the banquet hall. Other chambers in the palace consist of a front room, a living room, a suite for the vice-president, a guest waiting room and the president's office. The palace consists of 2 main audience halls named Ruang Upacara and Ruang Jamuan, each connected with a corridor decorated with various paintings. During the colonial era, Ruang Upacara (Ceremonial Hall) was formerly a ballroom. As its name states, the room is used for formal ceremonial events in the palace. In the room there are Javanese and Balinese Gamelan sets used for cultural performance purposes and a podium. The Ruang Jamuan (Banquet Hall) is used to provide hospitality and repasts to state guests within the palace. It has a capacity of 150 people and is decorated with a painting of Ratu Kidul by Basoeki Abdullah.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230495", "title": "Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich of Russia", "text": "Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich of Russia\n\nGrand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich of Russia (; 13 June 1860 – 28 January 1919) was a son of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich and a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia. He followed a military career. Although he never played any political role, as a relative of Tsar Nicholas II, he was executed by firing squad at the walls of Peter and Paul Fortress during the Russian Civil War.\n\nGrand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich was born at Strelna on 13 June 1860, the third son and fifth child of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia and Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna, born Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. When Dmitry turned 7 his education was turned over to Alexei Zelenoy, an officer who had served under his father in the Imperial Navy. His lessons followed the usual course: science, arithmetic, Russian and world history, composition, and geography alternating languages and the arts. He learned besides Russian, French, German and English. Like all the male members of the Romanov family, he was destined from birth to follow a military career. At his christening, Dmitry was named honorary colonel in Chief, a month later he was enrolled in the Guard Equipage, and in the Imperial family's 4th Rifle Battalion Life Guards Infantry Regiment.\n\nDmitry's father, Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich, was Admiral General of the Russian Navy and hoped one of his sons would follow in his footsteps. With this in mind, Dmitry received lessons in naval warfare and tactics. His religious education left a big imprint on him. He would be a deeply religious man all his life. As both of his parents were musical, he received singing lesson and learned to play the piano and the violin. Dmitry was a diligent and good student, polite and attentive, capable and kind. He was also very shy and introverted, preferring quiet times reading to more usual pursuits of childhood.\n\nHis parents' marriage was unhappy and Dmitry was still a child when his father started a new family with his mistress, a Russian ballerina. A second family setback scared him even further. Dmitry was 14 when his eldest brother Nikolai Konstantinovich was disinherited, declared insane and sent into internal Russian exile, after stealing some diamonds from an icon in his mother's bedroom. Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna made her three remaining sons: Konstantin age 16, Dmitry 14, and Vyacheslav 12, promise her that they would never drink, never give themselves to a life of self-indulgence, never forget that all the privileges of their wealth and rank were meant for use and not enjoyment. Brought up under these conditions, the younger Konstantinovich grand dukes grew into thoughtful, introspective men\nAt the age of 15, Dmitry, with his younger brother Vyacheslav, was enrolled as a cadet aboard the tender \"Kadetski\". Together the two brothers underwent the rigors of life at sea. During their training cruises through the Gulf of Finland, they spent their time drilling, standing watch, and taking turns leading their fellow cadets. In 1877, the 17-year-old Dmitry made his first official public appearance as a member of the Imperial family, he joined Alexander II with his father and cousins Grand Duke Sergei and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich on a journey to southern Russia in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878.\nDmitry soon disappointed his father's wishes when he decided to abandon his career in the Navy in favor of the Imperial Army. He used the interval of an illness to ask his father to allow him to join the army. It was a blow to Konstantin to see his third consecutive son to leave the navy, but Dmitry begged his father and with the intervention of Alexandra Iosifovna, he was eventually allowed to leave the Navy and join the Horse Guards regiment in 1879.\n\nLike his parents, Dmitry was musical; he had a particular love for Russian church music. In later years, he often sang in the chapel choirs at Strelna, the Marble Palace and the Pokrovsky Convent in Kiev. Duty stood at the core of his being and he was fiercely critical of a system, which pushed members of the Imperial family forward simply because of who they were. He believed that their promotions should be earned\n\nIntensely shy, Dmitry preferred to avoid society, but on summer evenings at Petergof he often rode from Strelna to Znamenka, the house of his cousin, Grand Duke Pyotr where he was a welcome guest. Peter's wife, Grand Duchess Militsa, played the piano while Dmitry was usually persuaded to join in, accompanying with his own singing of Russian folk songs.\n\nOn 1 June 1880, Dmitry Konstantinovich was appointed to the suite of Alexander II and given the rank of Fligel-Adjutant. Six months later, after completing his initial infantry training, the grand duke was appointed lieutenant in the Horse Guards Regiment. He was to serve with the Horse Guards for twelve years as a junior officer, and finally as commander.\nAfter completing a training course with the General Staff Academy in 1880, Dmitry Konstantinovich was promoted to Ordnance Officer and scheduled to make his first official appearance, when he would deliver the report as an Imperial Adjutant in the Guards Sappers Cavalry Regiment. The date for his first appearance was Sunday, 1 March 1881. Two hours after the review, his uncle Alexander II, who had been present at the insistence of Alexandra Iosifovna, was assassinated.\n\nIn November 1881, Alexander III promoted Dmitry Konstantinovich to the position of Adjutant in the H. I. M. Retinue. Celebrating Dmitry's majority on 26 November of that year was delayed owing the assassination of Alexander II. The ceremony took place later and coincided with the Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich taking an oath to the Emperor.\nThrough the 1880s, Dmitry Konstantinovich served with his regiment with unceasing energy and an eye toward correcting grievances from his men. He built himself a two-storied dacha at Krasnoye Selo, equipping the property with stables and exercise yard for the horses. Here he spent the summers with his regiment; in spring and fall, he invariably invited his regimental officers to his Palace, Strelna, which he inherited on the death of his father in 1892. Mornings were spent riding through the park in which, the grand duke put his men and their horses through intricate maneuvers; after lunch, he would lead the officers on walks through the exquisite gardens.\n\nOn 6 April 1889, the grand duke was promoted to the rank of captain and given command of the 2nd Squadron of the Horse Guards. Three years later, on 10 December 1892, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and owing to his distinguished service, he was given command of the House Guards Grenadiers Regiment by Alexander III. Dmitry was a popular commander, and a tough and demanding officer. He took pride in his soldiers, and was greatly concerned with their welfare.\n\nDmitry was very religious and he assumed responsibility for the church of the Apparition of the Virgin near Strelna, which was the regimental church of the Horse Grenadiers. He commissioned both an enlargement and a renovation program, which he paid for himself.\n\nThe grand duke's main residence was the splendid Palace of Strelna, where he lived a quiet and misanthropic life and was his main residence until the revolution. He lived in a suite of rooms of the ground floor on the west wing that had previously been occupied by his father. He had the palace electrified, telephones were installed and modern plumbing provided for the bathroom and the kitchen.\n\nDmitry Konstantinovich was fair, with blond hair and blue eyes, and wore a small cavalry mustache. He was tall and lean with long legs and a long neck that increased his extraordinary height. In a family known for the height of its male members, Dmitry was among the tallest. Grand Duchess Militsa considered him \"the nicest and best among the grand dukes\". He was proper, dignified and very refined in his manners.\n\nAlexander Mosolov, head of Nicholas II's Court Chancellery, described him as \"full of good sense\", remarking that Dmitry Konstantinovich \"was the one among all the grand dukes who was most deeply imbued with the sense of his duty as a Prince and a cousin of the Emperor\".\n\nOne day, the grand duke dispatched a hefty portion of his annual civil list income to support a struggling church. When Mosolov learnt of this he warned, \" If you make gifts everywhere on this scale, your revenues will not last.\" But Dmitry Konstantinovich replied that the stipend was \"not intended to enable us to live as sybarites; this money is put into our hands in order that we may augment the prestige of the Imperial family\".\n\nThe grand duke was a lifelong bachelor, never involved in scandals. His cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich accused him of misogyny in his book of memoirs, but this was contradicted with the close affective relationships he had with female members of his family. He was adored by his family and especially by his young nieces and nephews, with whom he would happily play and ride for hours. He was particularly close to the children of his brother Konstantin. His nephew Prince Gabriel Konstantinovich remembered him, as a \"wonderful, kind person\" who was almost a second father and wherever they saw him, they ran across the room, jumping up to hug him and wrap their arms around his neck. Dmitry Konstantinovich also loved to tease the children and play practical jokes on them.\nUnder Nicholas II, the grand duke received further promotions. On 26 May 1896, he was raised to the rank of Major-General, and three months later, he was named General à la suite in the Imperial Entourage. On 19 December 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich was promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed Adjutant General to Nicholas II. Nicholas II also appointed the grand duke general director of the Imperial Stud in 1896. Despite his love of the military, it was this later post that struck the deepest chord in Dmitry Konstantinovich. On learning of his appointment, the grand duke — whom one courtier termed \"timid beyond imagination\" declared, \" I should have eagerly accepted the appointment if it only meant looking after horses… I am afraid I shall never get on properly with officials.\"\n\nDmitry Konstantinovich was entranced with his new position, one of which demanded that he traveled across Russia and Europe, selecting the finest horses. Acting on his advice, the Imperial Stud purchased Galtee More, who had won the Derby in Great Britain, for an astronomical 200,000 rubles; as soon as he arrived in Russia, the thoroughbred was put to stud at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitry Konstantinovich held the post until 1905, when he was replaced with Major-General Alexei Zdnovich. On 10 January 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich relinquished command of the Horse Guard grenadiers Regiment. Although he would have been happy to remain in his post, his eyesight was failing rapidly, in detriment to his military career. Reluctantly he recognized that by remaining he was depriving another, more capable man of advancement. On leaving active service, the grand duke generously gave his dacha at Krasnoye Selo to the Horse Guards Regiment, to be used as an officer's club.\n\nThe grand duke's retirement allowed him to focus solely on his passion for horses. Dmitry Konstantinovich created a model equestrian center, the Dubrovsky Stud farm, outside the Village of Mirgord, in the Poltava province. In 1911, Dmitry became president of the Imperial Society of Horse Racing, and was named Honorary president of the Russian society of Care and Protection of Animals. In the autumn of 1913, he inaugurated the Russian Imperial Horse Exposition in Kiev, and the first Russian Sport Competition, a kind of Slavic Olympic Games.\n\nWith time, the grand duke frequently retreated to Crimea, where he enjoyed the last, carefree years of the Romanov dynasty along the Black Sea shores. In 1907 he purchased a small plot of land at Gaspara in the Crimea, the following year he commissioned the construction of Kichkine, from the Tartar word \"tiny Jewel\". The villa was designed in Moorish style and built with local whitewashed stone. Here the grand duke and his guest spent many pleasant evenings watching the sunset over the Black Sea, unaware that the sun was also setting over their privileged way of life.\n\nDmitry's mother died in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke's poor eyesight became the source of temporary mirth at the end of the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.\n\nDmitry had anticipated a clash with Germany for years and was not surprised at the outbreak of World War I. By then, he was almost blind which kept him from participating in the conflict, and he had to content himself with a job training the cavalry regiments away from the field of action.\n\nNever meddling in politics, Dmitry Konstantinovich remained silent in the turmoil that preceded the fall of the Romanovs, believing it was not his place to offer unsolicited advice to Nicholas II.\nDmitry was at his estate of Kichkin in Crimea when he learned that Rasputin had been murdered. He was outraged that members of the Imperial family, among them his sister Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, had signed and sent a plea for leniency on behalf of Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich to the Emperor. He said that had he been in Petrograd at the time, he would have never signed the letter.\n\nThe grand duke was in Petrograd when the revolution broke out in late February 1917. In spite of the uncertainty of the times, he had purchased a large mansion on Petrogradsky Quay in Petrograd.\nHe was staying there when he learned of Nicholas II's abdication and the declaration of the provisional government. After the fall of his family from power, he lived quietly, in obscurity, depending largely on Alexander Koronchentzov, his trusted Adjutant, for the necessities of daily life. His niece Princess Tatiana, who had lost her husband during the war, was living with him.\n\nAfter the successful Bolshevik coup of November 1917, the Petrograd newspapers published a decree summoning all the Romanovs to report to the dreaded Cheka, the secret police. Initially they were just required not to leave the city. In March 1918 the Romanovs registered were summoned again now to be sent away. Dmitry went accompanied by Colonel Alexander Korochenzov, his adjutant and his niece Princess Tatiana Constantinovna, who insisted in going with him to ensure that he was not alone and subjected to unwanted pressure.\n\nThe Bolshevik leaders of Petrograd, Grigory Zinoviev (born Radomyslsky-Apfelbaum) and Moisei Uritsky, decided to send the male members of the Romanov family into internal Russian exile. Fearing the eventual occupation of Petrograd by the Germans, they moved the capital to Moscow. Dmitry was offered a choice for exile: Vologda, Olonets, or Vyatka. He chose Vologda, the closest city to the former Imperial Capital. On 18 April, Dmitry, carrying a suitcase and in the company of his niece, Princess Tatiana, her two children, the children's nanny, and his Adjutant Colonel Korochentzov, boarded a train and left Petrograd for exile.\n\nIn Vologda, Dmitry Konstantinovich took two rooms in a house owned by a local merchant, just opposite the river. He lived in one room with Colonel Korochentzov, while Tatiana and the children occupied the other. They were not registered in their movement, and were able to walk about town at will. Shortly after they arrival, they learned that Grand Dukes Nicholas and Georgy Mikhailovich had also been exiled to the town. The prisoners enjoyed relative freedom; aside from having to report to Cheka Headquarters once a week, they could come and go as they wished, and took long walks around the town, visiting and dining with each other frequently. In the middle of May, Colonel Alexander von Leiming, one of Dmitry Konstantinovich's adjutants, arrived in Vologda with news that passage had been prepared to Finland, but the grand duke refused to leave Russia \n\nThis quiet and uncertain situation was abruptly interrupted on 14 July, two days before the murder of Nicholas II and his family. That morning a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were transported to a small, walled village, where they could be more easily guarded.\nGrand Duke Georgy wrote to his wife in England, \"We were each given a cell, and later on were joined by Dmitry. I saw him arriving through the iron bars of my window, and was struck by his sad expression. The first twenty-four hours were hard, but after that, they luckily allowed us to have our camp beds and also our clothes. There is no one in the prison but we three\". They were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. \"They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside\". While imprisoned, they learned that Nicholas II and his family had been killed; this seemed to indicate the worst and princess Tatiana left Vologda with her two young children to return to Petrograd. Then on 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.\n\nUpon arrival, Dmitry Konstantinovich and the other grand dukes were questioned at length by Moisei Uritsky, the Chairman of the Petrograd Cheka. Grand Duke Georgy wrote \" Dmitry asked Uritsky why we were imprisoned, and his answer was that it was to save us as the people intended shooting us at Vologda\", an explanation hard to believe. The prisoners were photographed, and then moved to the Kresty prison.\n\nShortly thereafter, they were transferred to Shpalernaya prison, where they would remain for most of their incarceration. Here each had his own private cell, if only seven feet long and three feet wide. Their only furniture was a hard iron bed. The Grand Dukes were permitted to exercise a half-hour to 45 minutes twice a day, although the personal contact allowed in Vologda was denied them here at first. Their wardens, all of whom were soldiers, treated them well; they even helped the grand dukes smuggle out letters. After several days they were all allowed to gather in the courtyard and were permitted some provisions from the outside such as fresh linens and cigarettes. Their day began at 7 am when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. Lunch was served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones in it and black bread. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7 pm, although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. The meetings of the grand dukes during exercise gave them opportunity to exchange a few words.\n\nPrince Gavril Konstantinovich was in a cell adjoining theirs; he was shocked at his uncle Dmitry's appearance when they were first reunited. Until the last, Gavril recalled, Dmitry was the cheerful favorite uncle of his childhood, telling him jokes, attempting to raise the spirits, and bribing prison Guards to carry hopeful messages to his nephew's cell. Some of their relatives made frantic efforts in their behalf to obtain their release through Maxim Gorky who was sympathetic and asked Lenin to set them free. Near the end of 1918, Prince Gavril, who was sick, was eventually permitted to leave and found his way out of Russia.\n\nColonel von Leiming regularly sent food each day for Grand Duke Dmitry; on 29 January 1919, it was returned to him with a note the grand duke was no longer being held prisoner. The following day he learned that he had been executed.\n\nThere are no eyewitness accounts of the execution. What is known is based on versions that are derived from rumors and second hand information. They vary on the details, some have an overly dramatic air about them, but they all have a similar ring.\n\nAt 11:30 pm on the night of 27–28 January, guards awoke Grand Dukes Dmitry Konstantinovich, and Nikolai Mikhailovich and Georgy Mikhailovich, in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them that they were going to be moved and they had to pack their belongings. They initially assumed that they were going to be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich even thought that they might set free, but his brother Georgy said that it was more likely they were heading to another place to be shot. The Grand Dukes had an ominous hint of what was going to happen to them, when at the time of departure, they were told to leave their luggage.\n\nThe grand dukes were taken outside and loaded into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January they left the prison. They drove towards the river by the fields of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and was shot in the back as he fled. The truck eventually began running again, and they drove to the fortress set up at the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Cathedral. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.\n\nSome different soldiers appeared carrying another person, whom the grand dukes finally recognized as their cousin Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich. They were then each escorted arm in arm with a soldier on each side towards a trench that had been dug in the courtyard. As they passed the cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Pavel where their ancestors were buried, the Grand Dukes crossed themselves. The prisoners were lined up before the ditch, in which there were already 13 bodies, Nikolai Mikhailovich who had been carrying his cat, handed it to a soldier asking him to look after it. All of the grand dukes faced death with the greatest courage. Georgy and Dmitry prayed quietly, Dmitry for the forgiveness of his murderers \"Forgive them, for they know not what they do\" seemed to be his last words. Pavel, who was very sick, was shot on a stretcher. Grand Dukes Nikolai, Georgy and Dmitry were killed by the same blast. The fusillade of shots sent their bodies reeling into the trench.\n\nAlthough the bodies of the other three grand dukes were thrown into a mass grave within the fortress, that of Dmitry Konstantinovich was secretly collected the next morning by his devoted former Adjutant, von Leiming, rolled up in a rug and taken away for a private burial in the garden of a house in Petrograd, where he remains to this day.\n\nThe Grand Duke received several Russian and foreign decorations:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2230501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230501", "title": "Merdeka Palace", "text": "Merdeka Palace\n\nThe Merdeka Palace (; also known in Indonesian as \"Istana Gambir\" and during the Dutch colonial times as \"Paleis te Koningsplein\"), is one of six presidential palaces in Indonesia. It is located on the north side of the Merdeka Square in Central Jakarta, Indonesia and is used as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThe palace was a residence for the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies during the colonial era. In 1949, the palace was renamed Merdeka Palace, \"(ke)merdeka(an)\" meaning \"freedom\" or \"independence\".\n\nThe Merdeka Palace is part of the Jakarta Presidential Palace Complex, which also includes the Negara Palace, Wisma Negara (state guest house), Sekretariat Negara (State Secretariat), and the Bina Graha building. It is the center of the Indonesian executive authority.\n\nThe building that is now the Merdeka Palace was built in the premise of the Rijswijk Palace (present Istana Negara) when it was considered no longer sufficed for administrative purposes e.g. big receptions and conferences during the mid-19th-century. In 1869, the instruction to construct a new palace was given by Governor-General Pieter Mijer. Construction took place on the south lawn of the Rijswijk Palace on 23 March 1873 during the tenure of Governor-General James Loudon.\n\nThe Neo-Palladian palace was designed by Jacobus Bartholomeus Drossaers and was built by the Department of Public Works and the contracting firm Drossaers & Company at a cost of ƒ 360,000. The new building was built in southern part of the Rijswijk Palace grounds, directly facing Koningsplein (now Merdeka Square).\n\nConstruction of the palace was finished in 1879 during the tenure of Governor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge. The new palace was given the official name \"Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal\" (\"Palace of the Governor-General\"), the official residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and his family.\n\nGovernor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge (1875-1881) was the first to reside in the building. Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer (1936-1942) was the last Dutch governor-general to reside in the Palace.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), the \"Saiko Shikikan\" (army commander) of the Japanese garrison resided in the Rijswijk Palace compound. Three Japanese commanders have taken residence in the Merdeka Palace.\n\nThe Indonesian national revolution (1945–1949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the Flag of Indonesia. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled \"Merdeka! (Freedom!)\". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace. Tony Lovink, the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace. The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka (\"Indendepence Place\") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours.\n\nOn 27 December 1949, a day after the ceremony, President Sukarno and his family arrived from Yogyakarta. For the first time, the President of the Republic of Indonesia settled in Merdeka Palace.\n\nThe first annual Independence Day ceremony was held at the Merdeka Palace in 1950.\n\nThe building has remain unchanged since the building was finished in 1879. After the Indonesian independence, the Merdeka Palace compound was expanded to include not only Istana Negara (State Palace), but also to construct Wisma Negara, Sekretariat Negara (State Sectreatiat) and Bina Graha. Several colonial buildings and residences were demolished in the Weltevreden area to make way for today's State Palace compound.\n\nA small octagonal gazebo located in the courtyard of the palace was used as private school for Sukarno's and the palace staff's children. This gazebo was previously used by Dutch colonial officials as \"muziekkoepel\" (music gazebo), where music performances were played during formal balls.\n\nWhen Suharto became president of Indonesia, he made changes to the previously residential function of the Palace. Sukarno's bedroom was converted into Ruang Bendera Pusaka (Regalia Room) and the room of Sukarno's wife Fatmawati became the President's bedroom. An old wooden building in the palace complex known as \"Sanggar\" was demolished to make way for the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries. Later he also built the Bina Graha building on the palace grounds, which he used as his office.\n\nWhen Megawati took office, she had the Puri Bhakti Renatama building converted into the President's office, while its contents moved to Bina Graha building. She also restored the furniture and decorations of the palace back to the way it was under Sukarno. Suharto's Jepara wood carving furniture was removed, with the exception of the Ruang Jepara (Jepara Room, as a reminder of Suharto's regime), and replaced with the old colonial refurbishment.\n\nThe Merdeka Palace serves as an official venue for state events such as the Independence Day ceremony, welcoming (foreign) dignitaries, cabinet meetings, state banquets and reception of letters of credence from foreign ambassadors. Additionally, it still contains the president's private quarters and offices.\n\nThe administrative role that the palace once had, has been shifted to the State Palace and State Secretariat, while the Merdeka Palace remains a symbol of authority.\n\nA 17 m tall flagpole and a fountain are located on the front lawn of the Merdeka Palace. The annual flag raising ceremony takes place during the Indonesian Independence day on 17 August. During the Independence ceremony, the veranda is often used as a ceremonial stage for the President and dignitaries.\n\nNotable rooms in the Palace include:\n\n\nThe presidents after Sukarno no longer use the palace as a residence, although it is still the official presidential residence. The palace's offices are still in use by the current Indonesian president. During the Suharto administration, Suharto preferred to reside in his own house at Jalan Cendana, Menteng, while the palace and Bina Graha only served as his office. The palace once again became the official presidential residence during the Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati administrations. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sometimes resides in Merdeka Palace, however just like Suharto, he often prefers to reside in his own house, at Puri Cikeas, Cibubur, south of Jakarta.\n\nSince 17 July 2016, the changing of the guard ceremony by the Paspampres has been opened to the public. It is held at 8 am on every last Sunday of the month in front of the palace yard.\n\n\n"}

He previously served as the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, from September 1, 2004, to August 10, 2007, and as Acting Commander, U.S. Strategic Command from July 9, 2004, to September 1, 2004. He retired from the Marine Corps on August 3, 2011, after nearly 40 years of service.\n\nCartwright was accused of providing classified information that was published in the book \"Confront and Conceal\" by David Sanger. During the course of the investigation, Cartwright agreed to be interviewed by the FBI without a lawyer present. He was indicted for lying to the FBI regarding the time and locations of meetings with Sanger. Cartwright was never charged with leaking any classified information; Sanger maintains that Cartwright did not provide him with any classified material. On October 17, 2016, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding an investigation into the source of leaked classified information; He had been scheduled to be sentenced on January 31, 2017, but was pardoned and had his security clearance restored by President Barack Obama on January 17, 2017.\n\nCartwright was born on September 22, 1949, in Rockford, Illinois, and attended West High School before going on to the University of Iowa. While there he was a scholarship swimmer for the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nCartwright was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in November 1971. He attended Naval Flight Officer training and graduated in April 1973. He attended Naval Aviator training and graduated in January 1977. He has operational assignments as a Naval Flight Officer in the F-4, and as a pilot in the F-4, OA-4, and F/A-18. His callsign comes from the fictional character Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright, the middle brother on the classic 1960s TV show \"Bonanza\", who was played by actor Dan Blocker.\n\nCartwright's operational assignments include: Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (2000–2002), Deputy Commanding General Marine Forces Atlantic (1999–2000), Commander Marine Aircraft Group 31 (1994–1996), Commander Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (1992), Fixed Wing Operations Marine Aircraft Group 24 (1991), Commander Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 12 (1989–1990), Administration Officer and Officer-In-Charge Deployed Carrier Operations VMFAT-101 (1983–1985), Aircraft Maintenance Officer VMFA-235 (1979–1982), Line Division Officer VMFA-333 (1975–1977), Embarkation OIC VMFA-251 & 232 (1973–1975).\n\nCartwright's staff assignments include: Director for Force Structure, Resources and Assessment, J-8 the Joint Staff (2002–2004); Directorate for Force Structure, Resources and Assessment, J-8 the Joint Staff (1996–1999); Deputy Aviation Plans, Policy, and Budgets Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps (1993–1994); Assistant Program Manager for Engineering, F/A-18 Naval Air Systems Command (1986–1989).\n\nCartwright was named the Outstanding Carrier Aviator by the Association of Naval Aviation in 1983. He graduated with distinction from the Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell AFB 1986, and received his Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, 1991. In 2008, he was honored with Naval War College Distinguished Graduate Leadership Award. He was selected for and completed a fellowship with Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994.\n\nFrom July 9, 2004, to September 1, 2004, Lieutenant General Cartwight served as Acting Commander, U.S. Strategic Command while awaiting official assumption of office and promotion as Strategic Command's new commander. On September 1, 2004, Cartwright was sworn in as Commander, U.S. Strategic Command. He was promoted to full general on the same day.\n\nOn June 8, 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recommended Cartwright to be the next Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to replace retiring Admiral Edmund Giambastiani; President George W. Bush formally announced the nomination, with that of Admiral Michael Mullen to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on June 28, 2007.\n\nSenator John Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated, \"General Cartwright has an extraordinary grasp and understanding of the global posture that America must maintain in this era of new and ever-changing threats\".\n\nCartwright's nomination was confirmed by the full Senate on August 3, 2007. Due to the retirement of Admiral Giambastiani on July 27, 2007, Cartwright assumed the position immediately upon confirmation. He was sworn in on August 31, 2007, as the 8th Vice Chairman. On March 18, 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that Cartwright had been nominated for a second term as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\nHe was confirmed by the Senate on July 31, 2009.\n\nThe military investigated Cartwright in 2009 and 2010 for possible misconduct involving a female Marine captain, and investigators recommended administrative action for \"failure to discipline a subordinate\" and \"fostering an unduly familiar relationship\". Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, however, reviewed the evidence and found it insufficient to warrant corrective action for even the lesser offenses. He stated, \"I do not agree with the conclusion that General Cartwright maintained an 'unduly familiar relationship' with his aide. Nor do I agree that General Cartwright's execution of his leadership responsibilities vis-à-vis his aide or any other member of his staff was inconsistent with the leadership requirements\". \"[Q]uestions about how he oversaw his staff\", however, were mentioned as a reason Cartwright had fallen out as favored candidate of President Obama for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011. Army chief Gen. Martin Dempsey was named to the post. \"Some Republicans [had] ... quietly criticized Gen. Cartwright, calling him 'Obama's general,'\" one report at the time also said.\n\nCartwright held his retirement ceremony on August 3, 2011. During the ceremony, Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III presented Cartwright his fourth Defense Distinguished Service Medal. He also will receive the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard distinguished service medals.\n\nCartwright received the following decorations, awards, and badges:\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Cartwright had received a \"target letter\" from the U.S. Justice Department, informing him that he was under investigation for leaking classified information about Stuxnet, a computer virus used in a U.S.-Israel cyberattack against centrifuges in Iranian nuclear facilities (see Operation Olympic Games). Federal investigators reportedly suspected that Cartwright leaked details of the operation to a \"New York Times\" reporter.\n\nIn March 2015, the \"Washington Post\" reported that the sensitive leak investigation, led by Rod J. Rosenstein, had \"stalled amid concerns that a prosecution in federal court could force the government to confirm\" information about the highly classified program. U.S. officials feared that if classified information were revealed in any information, it would harm U.S.-Israeli relations and would also complicate the then-pending negotiations on an agreement with Iran over the nuclear program. It was reported that federal prosecutors had discussions with the Office of White House Counsel, then led by Kathryn Ruemmler, on whether certain material important to the case would be declassified, and Ruemmler conveyed that the government was unwilling to provide the documentation.\n\nCartwright denied any wrongdoing; his attorney, Gregory B. Craig, said in March 2015 that Cartwright had no contact with federal investigators for over a year. Craig stated: \"General Cartwright has done nothing wrong. He has devoted his entire life to defending the United States. He would never do anything to weaken our national defense or undermine our national security. Hoss Cartwright is a national treasure, a genuine hero and a great patriot.\"\n\nOn November 2, 2012, in an interview with the FBI, Cartwright denied he was the source of the leaks. On October 17, 2016, Cartwright entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on a charge of making false statements during the leak investigation, a felony.\n\nOutgoing President Barack Obama pardoned Cartwright on January 17, 2017, two weeks prior to his scheduled sentencing hearing.\n\nCartwright was the inaugural holder of the Harold Brown Chair in Defense Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank - a post he held from 2011 until 2017. In addition, Cartwright serves as a member of board of directors of The Raytheon Company, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, and as a defense consultant for ABC News.\n\nCartwright is an advisor for several corporate entities involved in global management consulting, technology services and program solutions. predictive and big data analytics. and advanced systems engineering, integration, and decision-support services. He serves as an advisor to the board of directors for Accenture, Enlightenment Capital, IxReveal, Logos Technologies, Opera Solutions, and TASC Inc. He is also affiliated with a number of professional organizations, including the Aspen Strategy Group, The Atlantic Council, Nuclear Threat Initiative, and The Sanya Initiative.\n\nCartwright is also a leading advocate for the phased and verified elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide (\"Global Zero (campaign)\"). In October 2011, he spoke at the Global Zero Summit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and currently serves as Chair of the Global Zero U.S. Nuclear Policy Commission, which in May 2012 released its report, \"Modernizing U.S. Nuclear Force Structure and Policy,\" calling for the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals 80% to 900 total weapons each, which would pave the way to bringing other nuclear weapons countries into the first-in-history multilateral nuclear arms negotiations.\n\nIn June 2015, Cartwright was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then-pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program. That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers' support for it. The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter. Cartwright endorsed the final agreement in August 2015, becoming one of 36 retired generals and admirals to sign an open letter in support of the agreement.\n\n\n\n"}

His actions on arriving in the United States led to a major political and international incident, which was termed the Citizen Genêt Affair. Because of his actions, President George Washington asked the French government to recall him. During this time, the government in France changed and an arrest warrant was issued for Genêt. Fearing for his life, he asked for asylum in America, which was granted. Genêt stayed in the United States until his death. Historian Carol Berkin argues that the Genêt affair bolstered popular respect for the president and strengthened his role in dealing with in foreign affairs.\n\nGenêt was born in Versailles in 1763. He was the ninth and final child of a French civil servant, Edmond Jacques Genêt (1726–1781), who was a head clerk in the ministry of foreign affairs. The elder Genêt analyzed British naval strength during the Seven Years' War and monitored the progress of the American Revolutionary War. His eldest sister was Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, who became an educator and author. Aglaé-Louise Auguié (1782-1854), who was the wife of Marshal Ney of France, was Genêt's niece.\n\nGenêt was a prodigy who could read French, English, Italian, Latin, Swedish, Greek, and German by the age of 12.\n\nAt 18, Genêt was appointed court translator, and in 1788 he was sent to the French embassy in Saint Petersburg to serve as ambassador. Over time, Genêt became disenchanted with the \"ancien régime\", learning to despise not just the French monarchy but all monarchical systems, including Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great. In 1792, Catherine declared Genêt \"persona non grata\", calling his presence \"not only superfluous but even intolerable.\" The same year, the Girondists rose to power in France and appointed Genêt to the post of minister to the United States.\n\nThe Citizen Genêt affair began in 1793 when he was dispatched to the United States to promote American support for France's wars with Spain and Britain.\n\nGenêt arrived in Charleston, South Carolina on the French frigate \"Embuscade\" on April 8. Instead of traveling to the then-capital of Philadelphia to present himself to U.S. President George Washington for accreditation, Genêt stayed in South Carolina. There he was greeted with enthusiasm by the people of Charleston, who threw a string of parties in his honor.\n\nGenêt's goals in South Carolina were to recruit and arm American privateers who would join French expeditions against the British. He commissioned four privateering ships in total, including the \"Republicaine\", the \"Anti-George\", the \"Sans-Culotte\", and the \"Citizen Genêt\". Working with French consul Michel Ange Bernard Mangourit, Genêt organized American volunteers to fight Britain's Spanish allies in Florida. After raising a militia, Genêt set sail toward Philadelphia, stopping along the way to marshal support for the French cause and arriving on May 16. He encouraged Democratic-Republican societies, but President Washington denounced them and they quickly withered away. He was also hosted by the Democratic-Republican Tammany Society in 1793.\n\nHis actions endangered American neutrality in the war between France and Britain, which Washington had pointedly declared in his Neutrality Proclamation of April 22. When Genêt met with Washington, he asked for what amounted to a suspension of American neutrality to support the cause of France. When turned down by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and informed that his actions were unacceptable, Genêt protested. Meanwhile, Genêt's privateers were capturing British ships, and his militia was preparing to move against the Spanish.\n\nGenêt continued to defy the wishes of the United States government, capturing British ships and rearming them as privateers. Washington sent Genêt an 8,000-word letter of complaint on Jefferson's and Hamilton's advice – one of the few situations in which the Federalist Alexander Hamilton and the Republican Jefferson agreed. Genêt replied obstinately. President Washington and his Cabinet then demanded that France recall Genêt as its Ambassador.\n\nThe Jacobins, having taken power in France by January 1794, sent an arrest notice which asked Genêt to come back to France. Genêt, knowing that he would likely be sent to the guillotine, asked Washington for asylum. It was Hamilton – Genêt's fiercest opponent in the cabinet – who convinced Washington to grant him safe haven in the United States.\n\nAfter obtaining asylum in the United States from Washington, Genêt moved to New York State. On June 26, 1808, Genêt wrote an article, \"Madison as a 'French Citizen,'\" for the \"New York Register\" in an attempt to promote the prospects of his father-in-law, the incumbent Vice President George Clinton, over James Madison in the presidential election of 1808. Noting the honorary French citizenship afforded Madison in 1792, Genêt reasoned that the Embargo Act of 1807 had been intended by Secretary of State Madison to aid Napoleon in the enforcement of the Berlin Decree, especially seeing that American trade with Britain was more important than that with France. Playing to a northeastern audience, Genêt continued that, judging by Jefferson's glorification of an agricultural lifestyle in Notes on the State of Virginia, the Embargo was also acting as a covert means to destroy New England's commercial heritage. As such, New Englanders would be forced to turn to agriculture, and Virginia's dominance of American politics would continue.\n\nGenêt married Cornelia Tappen Clinton (1774–1810) in 1794, the daughter of New York Governor George Clinton. Genêt lived on a farm he called Prospect Hill located in East Greenbush, New York overlooking the Hudson River. Living the life of a gentleman farmer, he wrote a book about inventions. Their children included:\n\n\nHis wife Cornelia died in 1810, and on July 31, 1814, Genêt remarried to Martha Brandon Osgood (1787–1853), the daughter of Samuel Osgood, the United States' first Postmaster General. Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nHe died on July 14, 1834 and is buried in the churchyard behind the Greenbush Reformed Church, about two miles east of his farm.\n\nEdmond Charles Clinton Genet (1896–1917), who served with the Lafayette Escadrille and was the first American flier to die in the First World War after the United States declared war against Germany in 1917, was Genêt's great-grandson.\n\nThe elementary school in East Greenbush, New York is named \"Citizen Genet Elementary School\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The council was mostly made up of members of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly and members of the Parliament of Canada who were appointed to serve on the council.\n\nNo members appointed were allowed to sit on the council until December 28, 1872. The council ran the territories under the \"Temporary Government of Rupert's Land Act\" and the \"Manitoba Act\". The council's mandate was renewed every year by the federal government until it was dissolved in 1876, to make way for the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe territory formally known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were sold to the Government of Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company on November 19, 1869. The two territories were amalgamated to form the Northwest Territories. The creation of a government for the territories was delayed by Louis Riel, who led the Red River Rebellion, ultimately leading to the creation of the province of Manitoba.\n\nThe Northwest Territories joined confederation with Manitoba on July 5, 1870. Despite the provisions in law for setting up a council under the Temporary Government Act, 1870, the first council appointments by the Governor General of Canada would not take place until November 28, 1872. The first attempt at creating the council came with the appointment of Francis Godschall Johnson by Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald on October 21, 1870. Johnson lost his appointment after it was overturned by the federal government. The federal government ruled Archibald had exceeded his powers in creating the council.\n\nThe first session of the Council began on March 8, 1873. The Council session was short sitting only two days. The Lieutenant Governor of the territory acted as Speaker, presiding over the Council. All acts of the Council had to be sent to Ottawa for approval by the Governor General.\n\nThe Council had a poor relationship with the press of the day. Appointments to the Council after 1872 were generally made in secret without official notification in some places and major publications were forbidden from covering early council proceedings. The Council met for meetings while it was in session at Early Government House in Fort Garry.\n\nThe Temporary North-West Council existed in law for a total of six years. An attempt was made to set up the council and appoint the first member by Lieutenant Governor Archibald on October 21, 1870. The federal government told Archibald that he overstepped his bounds and the appointment of Johnson was revoked days later. After the council was officially set up there were two main sets of appointments made, both of them by Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris.\n\nThe first batch of appointments came on December 28, 1872. That date Morris would appoint a total of eleven members to the council. This was the single biggest number of appointments in the history of the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly.\n\nLess than a full calendar year later and despite only being allowed up to fifteen seats, appointments to the council exceeded that limit during the second round in October 1873. All but two members of the Council held on to their seat until it was dissolved in 1876. William J. Christie resigned his seat in 1873 and Robert Cunningham was the only member of the council to die in office on July 4, 1874. In addition to the death of Cunningham, the first secretary of the North-West Council William T. Urquhart died at his home on September 24, 1874.\n\nOver the course of three legislative sessions the Council adopted legislation that formed the basis of Northwest Territories law. The legislation covered a wide variety of issues. The measures related to law and justice included customs duties, prohibition on liquor along with the establishment of a police force, the establishment of the Stipendiary Magistrate system.\n\nThe Council was equally responsive in establishing social policy. Welfare programs for native populations was established. This included negotiating the first treaties to bring in the reserve system. Legislation regulating how masters treat their servants was also implemented.\n\nIn regards to infrastructure, the Council passed regulations securing public right of ways including roads and waterways. Legislation was also implemented to send out survey parties to various parts of the territory. Resource management was also practiced with the limitation of the buffalo hunt, and regulations on other hunts including banning poisons for use in hunting practices.\n\nThe most notable legislation the council produced came out of the second legislative session that began on March 11, 1874. The council banned the importation and manufacture of spirituous liquors and passed a motion to recommend the creation of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). The purpose behind the ban was to prevent settlers from trading alcohol to native populations, with the NWMP created to enforce the prohibition. The only liquor allowed in the territory was brought in with special permission by the lieutenant governor. The Cypress Hills massacre was the driving force for the council to implement prohibition and recommend a police force.\n\nThe Council implemented legislation to provide training programs and equipment to teach native people agricultural practices. This legislation included providing cattle and other livestock. Members of the council also proposed and negotiated the first treaties, creating the reserve system in Canada.\n\nThe Council also set regulations in the final session to limit the Buffalo Hunt; this was a measure to address the sharp decline in the Buffalo population. This was also a further measure to encourage native populations to adopt agricultural practices using programs that had been previously implemented by the Government.\n\nThe Council also proposed the appointment of Stipendiary Magistrates to the North-West Council to deal with most legal cases in the territory. Each appointed Magistrate would take up residence in a certain area and be responsible for all legal cases. The Magistrates were given the option of referring cases of an unusual nature to the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba. This would become the prominent justice system of the territory until the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories was founded in 1887. This court system played a major role in the development and history of the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe last session of the Temporary North-West council was called on November 23, 1875. The throne speech outlined the need for regulation of the Buffalo Hunt, peaceful and orderly settlement to the territory and highlighted past legislative achievements of the council. The last council session closed on December 14, 1875 and did not meet again until it was dissolved on November 7, 1876.\n\n"}

It was a highly diverse electorate, as it contained both some of the wealthiest suburbs of Sydney, along the edge of the harbour, as well as some of the city's most disadvantaged areas, such as those around Redfern. This had the effect of making Bligh a marginal seat, although as the wealthier suburbs outnumbered the poorer suburbs, it tended to be Liberal-leaning. Independent Clover Moore defeated the incumbent Liberal member Michael Yabsley in 1988 (Yabsley subsequently reentered Parliament in the Vaucluse by-election later that year) and held the seat until its abolition in 2007, when it was replaced by the electoral district of Sydney.\n"}

Istana Bogor was opened to the public in 1968 to public tour groups (not individuals), with the permission of the acting President of Indonesia, Suharto. The gardens of the palace covers an area of 284,000 square metres (28.4 hectares).\n\nDuring the colonial era the palace became favorite residence of the Governors-General due to Bogor's more adaptable climate. It was also favored by the late President Sukarno and became the official presidential residence until his downfall in 1967. The palace remained mostly unused until February 2015, when the new president Joko Widodo moved the president's office from Merdeka Palace to Bogor Palace.\n\nThe original colonial building on the site of Istana Bogor was a mansion named Buitenzorg, meaning: \"Without a care\" in Dutch (also \"Sans Souci\", meaning: \"Without a care\" in French), which dates back to 1745 as a country retreat for the Dutch Governors to escape the heat and diseases of Batavia. The location for the new palace was discovered by Baron van Imhoff on 10 August 1744, in a village named \"\"Kampong Baroe\"\". On the site he ordered a mansion to be built, however the construction wasn't completed by the end of his career in 1750 and thus it was continued by his preceder Jacob Mossel.\n\nAn extensive renovation of the palace occurred under Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1808 – 1811). The palace was further expanded into two floors, with a new wing added in the east and west of the original structure.\n\nIn 1811 Stamford Raffles led a successful Invasion to Java and Britain took possession of the colony until 1816. Raffles had Buitenzorg Palace as his residence due to the temperate climate of the hills of Bogor, while conducting most of the council meeting in the palace of Rijswijk in Batavia. During his stay he had the garden of the Buitenzorg palace transformed into an English garden, which became an inspiration for the later botanical garden.\n\nLater the new governor general Baron van der Capellen (1817-1826) added a small dome on the roof of the main building and founded the botanical garden next to the palace ground. However, in 1834, an earthquake triggered by the volcanic eruption of Mount Salak, heavily damaged the old palace of Buitenzorg. The ruined palace was then demolished and rebuilt into its present form in 1856— this time with only one storey instead of the original two, as a precaution against further earthquakes.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1942 the Istana Bogor served as the official residence of the Dutch Governor General, however state affairs are still largely conducted in Batavia. Since its foundation, a total of 44 Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies had resided in the palace. After the Indonesian independence, several feature of the palace was renovated in 1952. Major changes include an additional porch at the main entrance and connecting corridors for the main buildings to its wings. The palace became the main residence of President Sukarno, but was later neglected by Suharto when he came to office.\n\nThe grounds of the estate contain several buildings, the largest are the Gedung Induk (main palace) and its two wings. The main palace building contains private offices for the head of state, library, dining room, theater room, the ministers' waiting room, the Teratai room (the living room) and the Garuda room (the main reception hall).\n\nThe 2 wing buildings located east and west of the main building. The eastern wing are used for foreign head of state's guesthouse, during the colonial period this wing was used for the governor general's personal guest. While the western wing have 2 main rooms, one are used as guesthouse for ministers who accompany the main guest during a state visit, and the other as a conference room. During the colonial period this wing are used by the staffs of the governor general.\n\nThe palace is decorated with an extensive art collection (448 paintings, 216 sculptures and 196 ceramics), 90% of which were accumulated by Sukarno. The original historic collection of the palace was looted by Japanese and Allied force during WW2, leaving nothing but 5 mirrors in the palace.\n\nOther buildings in the palace include 6 pavilions: \"Paviliun Dyah Bayurini, Paviliun Jodipati, Paviliun Amarta, Paviliun Madukara, Paviliun Pringgondani\", and \"Paviliun Dwarawati\". Paviliun Dyah Bayurini was built in 1964 and is used by the head of state and his/her family's during a stay in Bogor, the Pavilion also include a swimming pool. Other buildings are used as guesthouses for government ministers and officials. There is also a multi-purpose building which was built in 1908.\n\nThe garden covers an area of 28.4 hectare and are adjacent to Kebun Raya Bogor (Bogor Botanical Garden). A herd of spotted deer can be spotted roaming around the palace garden, they are native to India and Nepal. The deers were originally brought by the Governor General Daendels for hunting and sport.\n\nThere are many sculptures of various origin decorating the palace garden, some of them are noteworthy:\n\nIn 1856, along with the rebuilding of the Bogor Palace, the Dutch government built a hotel to serve as a guest house in the Bogor Palace. The hotel was first named the Dibbets Hotel for the founder, J. Dibbets. The hotel was also once known as the Binnenhof Hotel or Bellevue Hotel. \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation (1942-1945), the hotel was used as the Kempetai Headquarters (Japanese Military Police). After Indonesia's independence, the hotel was handed over to the Indonesian government and was renamed the Hotel Salak The Heritage after the name of Mount Salak, the largest mountain in Bogor. The word \"The Heritage\" was used to express to the public that this hotel is indeed one of the heritages of the city of Bogor. \n\nHotel Salak The Heritage is currently managed professionally, with 120 rooms, 12 meeting rooms, 3 restaurants, the Kinanty Music Café, a swimming pool, and other facilities. Hotel Salak The Heritage is still preserved by the government as one of the historical witnesses supporting the existence of the Bogor Palace in particular and the long history of the city of Bogor.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230558", "title": "Diadectes", "text": "Diadectes\n\nDiadectes (meaning \"crosswise-biter\") is an extinct genus of large, very reptile-like amphibians that lived during the early Permian period (Artinskian-Kungurian stages of the Cisuralian epoch, between 290 and 272 million years ago). \"Diadectes\" was one of the very first herbivorous tetrapods, and also one of the first fully terrestrial animals to attain large size.\n\n\"Diadectes\" was a heavily built animal, long, with a thick-boned skull, heavy vertebrae and ribs, massive limb girdles and short, robust limbs. The nature of the limbs and vertebrae clearly indicate a terrestrial animal. It was assumed that the rib cage was barrel shaped, but new fossils show the ribs were actually sticking out to the sides.\n\nIt possesses some characteristics of reptilians and amphibians, combining a reptile-like skeleton with a more primitive, seymouriamorph-like skull. \"Diadectes\" has been classified as belonging to the sister group of the amniotes.\n\nAmong its primitive features, \"Diadectes\" has a large otic notch (a feature found in all labyrinthodonts, but not in reptiles) with an ossified tympanum. At the same time its teeth show advanced specialisations for an herbivorous diet that are not found in any other type of early Permian animal. The eight front teeth are spatulate and peg-like, and served as incisors that were used to nip off mouthfuls of vegetation. The broad, blunt cheek teeth show extensive wear associated with occlusion, and would have functioned as molars, grinding up the food. It also had a partial secondary palate, which meant it could chew its food and breathe at the same time, something many even more advanced reptiles were unable to do.\n\nThese traits are likely adaptations related to the animals' high-fiber herbivorous diet, and evolved independently of similar traits seen in some reptilian groups. Many of the reptile-like details of the post-cranial skeleton are possibly related to carrying the substantial trunk, these may be independently derived traits on \"Diadectes\" and their relatives. Though very similar, they would be analogous rather than homologous to those of early amniotes like pelycosaurs and pareiasaurs, as the first reptiles evolved from small, swamp dwelling animals like \"Casineria\" and \"Westlothiana\". The phenomenon of nonrelated animals evolving similarly is known as convergent evolution.\n\n\"Diadectes\" was first named and described by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878, based on part of a lower jaw (AMNH 4360) from the Permian of Texas. Cope noted: \"Teeth with short and much compressed crowns, whose long axis is transverse to that of the jaws,\" the feature expressed in the generic name \"Diadectes\" \"crosswise biter\" (from Greek \"dia\" \"crosswise\" + Greek \"dēktēs\" \"biter\"). He described the animal as \"in all probability, herbivorous.\" Cope's Neo-Latin type species name \"sideropelicus\" (from Greek \"sidēros\" \"iron\" + Greek \"pēlos\" \"clay\" + -\"ikos\") \"of iron clay\" alluded to the Wichita beds in Texas, where the fossil was found.\n\"Diadectes\" fossil remains are known from a number of locations across North America, especially the Texas Red Beds (Wichita and Clear Fork).\n\nNumerous species have been assigned to \"Diadectes\", though most of those have proven to be synonyms of one another. Similarly, many supposed separate genera of diadectids have been shown to be junior synonyms of \"Diadectes\". One of these, \"Nothodon\", was actually published by Othniel Charles Marsh five days before the name \"Diadectes\" was published by his rival Edward Drinker Cope. Despite this fact, in 1912 Case synonymized the two names and treated \"Diadectes\" as the senior synonym, which has been followed by other paleontologists since, despite the fact that it violates the rules of biological nomenclature.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of \"Diadectes\" and related diadectids was presented in an unpublished Ph.D. thesis by Richard Kissel in 2010. Previous phylogenetic analyses of diadectids had found \"D. absitus\" to be more basal than other species of \"Diadectes\", outside the derived clade composed of these species. In these analyses, \"Diasparactus zenos\" was more closely related to the other species of \"Diadectes\" than was \"D. absitus\", making \"Diadectes\" paraphyletic. Kissel recovered this paraphyly in his analysis and proposed the new genus name \"Silvadectes\" for \"D. absitus\". Below is the cladogram from Kissel's thesis:\nHowever, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a name presented in an initially unpublished thesis such as Kissel's is not valid. Because the name \"Silvadectes\" has not yet been formally erected in a published paper, it is not currently considered valid.\n\n"}

Under White's leadership, the UFC has grown into a globally popular multibillion-dollar enterprise. As of August 2019, White's net worth was assessed at $500 million.\n\nDana White Jr. was born in Manchester, Connecticut on July 28, 1969, the son of June and Dana White. He and his sister, Kelly, were raised by their mother and her family for the majority of their childhoods. White has said he is an Irish American. \n\nHe began boxing at age 17 and graduated from Hermon High School in Maine in 1987. He started college twice, once at Quincy College and once at UMass Boston, but dropped out during his first semester each time. White then worked as a boxercise coach.\n\nWhite spent many of his early years residing in Ware, Massachusetts. He claims he left Boston for Las Vegas after reportedly being threatened by mobster Whitey Bulger and his associate Kevin Weeks. \"He basically said, 'You owe us money'. It was like $2,500, which was like $25,000 to me back then, and said, 'You owe us money.' It was actually a guy named Kevin Weeks, who if you saw the trial he's Whitey's right-hand man. I'm sure he's very prominent in the movie, but yeah basically said I owed him some money, and I didn't pay him. This went on for a while and one day I was at my place and I got a call and they said, 'You owe us the money tomorrow by 1 o'clock'. I literally hung up the phone, picked up the phone and called Delta and bought a ticket to Vegas.\"\n\nWhile working as a manager for Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell, White met Bob Meyrowitz, the owner of Semaphore Entertainment Group, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. When White learned that Meyerwitz was looking to sell the UFC, he contacted childhood friend Lorenzo Fertitta, an executive and co-founder of Station Casinos, and former commissioner of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, to ask if he would be interested in acquiring the company. In January 2001, Lorenzo and his older brother Frank acquired the UFC for $2 million, which subsequently became a subsidiary of Zuffa. White was installed as the company's president.\n\nWhite said that when he and the Fertittas acquired the UFC, all they received was the brand name \"UFC\" and an old octagon. The previous owners had stripped the company's assets to avoid bankruptcy, so much so that the UFC.com website had been sold to a company named \"User Friendly Computers\". Over time, with White as president, the UFC developed into a highly successful business, and its gross revenue was $600 million in 2015. In July 2016, Zuffa was sold to a consortium of investors led by WME-IMG for $4.025 billion. White owned 9% of the company at the time of the sale. White announced he would continue in his role as president, and was given a stake in the new business.\n\nIn May 2017, the UFC announced White would host \"Dana White's Contender Series.\" Available exclusively through UFC Fight Pass, the promotion’s digital streaming service, and licensed separately from the UFC brand, the show allows up and coming fighters the chance to showcase their talents in hopes that one day they may compete in the UFC.\n\nOn March 18, 2019, White revealed that he had signed a new, seven-year contract to remain president of the UFC, as the UFC signed a deal with ESPN.\n\nWhite entered the boxing scene by co-promoting Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor due to McGregor being contracted to the UFC. In October 2017, White said at Freddie Roach's Wild Card West boxing club that he was \"getting into boxing, 100 percent.\" White says that he wants to incorporate boxing into the company portfolio of the UFC.\n\n\nWhite met his wife Anne (née Stella) when they were in the eighth grade and they married in 1996. They have two sons, Dana III and Aidan, and one daughter, Savannah. White values his privacy, and keeps Anne out of the public spotlight. White bought a mansion in Pine Island Court, Las Vegas in 2006 from Frank Fertitta III for $1.95 million. White bought three other mansions in the same area from October 2016 to June 2017 for a combined total of around $6.2 million. Demolition permits were issued for the houses, presumably with the intent of creating a mega-mansion for White and his family.\n\nWhite is an atheist.\n\nIn 2011, White's mother, June, released the book \"Dana White, King of MMA: An Unauthorized Biography\". June claimed in the book that, since his success with the UFC, Dana had \"turned his back on his family and friends who were there for him when he needed help and support\".\n\nWhite spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. White said that Trump helped the UFC at its beginnings, allowing the UFC to host its first event under Zuffa ownership (UFC 30) at the Trump Taj Mahal when others venues refused to host the UFC. White said, \"No arenas wanted us. This guy reached out, and he's always been a friend to me.\" White reiterated his support for Trump for the 2020 election and spoke at the podium at one of Trump's reelection rallies.\n\nIn a season 15 episode of History Channel's \"Pawn Stars\" (originally airing on February 5, 2018), White purchased over $60,000 worth of Katana swords including one of Rick Harrison's 16th-century Japanese Katana.\n\nWhite was accused in a sex-tape scandal, when a stripper allegedly taped a sexual encounter with White in Brazil around the year 2014 without his consent. The stripper also alleged White had been seeing her for months during his marriage.The stripper's live-in boyfriend then tried to extort money from White, which resulted in a criminal case against her boyfriend. In Nevada, on April 3, 2020, a civil suit against White was filed, claiming he offered the boyfriend money to persuade him to plead guilty, in which White has denied. According to the complaint, White paid $10,000 to the stripper to dance and have sex with him.\n\nIn May 2012, White revealed that he had been diagnosed with Ménière's disease, a neurological disorder. He said, \"It's like vertigo but on steroids.\" White claims that the disease was brought on because of a large fight he was involved in during his youth.\n\nThe event was to be the first he had missed in 11 years with White staying home, adhering to medical advice.\n\nWhite is undergoing Orthokine treatment for Ménière's disease, which he says has greatly reduced his symptoms.\n\nIn 2010, White donated $50,000 for a liver transplant to Tuptim Jadnooleum, the daughter of “Kru Nai” Rattanachai, one of the instructors for Tiger Muay Thai and MMA in Phuket, Thailand.\n\nIn 2011, White donated $100,000 to his former high school to fund renovations to their athletic facilities.\n\n\n"}

From 1965 the bank was the principal subsidiary of the Irving Bank Corporation.\n\nBetween 1913 and 1931, its headquarters was in the Woolworth Building; after 1931, until it was acquired by Bank of New York, its headquarters was located at One Wall Street, at what is now known as the BNY Mellon Building.\n\nThe bank had its origins in 1851, when the Irving Bank of the City of New York was founded. Since there was not yet a federal currency, each bank issued its own paper and those institutions with the most appealing names found their certificates more widely accepted. The firm was named after Washington Irving, an author, diplomat, and lawyer who had gained an international reputation as America's first man of letters. His portrait appeared on the bank's notes and contributed to their wide appeal.\n\nIn June 1865, it converted from a state bank to a bank chartered under the National Bank Act of 1863, and became the Irving National Bank of New York. In 1907, after a merger, it became the Irving National Exchange Bank of New York, changing its name to the Irving National Bank in 1912. In 1922, it merged with the Columbia Trust Company, a New York State-chartered bank, creating the Irving Bank and Trust Company. Later, in 1926, it acquired by merger the American Exchange-Pacific Bank, and changed its name to the American Exchange Irving Trust Company. Finally, in 1929, it changed its name to the Irving Trust Company, the name under which it was known until 1989.\n\nAs of March 9, 1921, there were four national banks in New York City operating branch offices, also including Catham and Phenix National, the Mechanics and Metals National, the Irving National, and National City Bank. In 1929, Irving was New York's fourth ranked financial institution, and fifth in the United States.\n\nIrving Trust was an official sponsor of the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nIn 1983, the Irving Trust had 13 branches in New York and was primarily a wholesale bank working with mid- and large-sized corporations and banks. It also had offices around the world, allowing for their claim that the sun never set on the Irving.\n\nOn October 7, 1988, the Irving Trust board signed an agreement to merge with Bank of New York ending a yearlong battle as Bank of New York engineered a hostile takeover. At the time of the merger the combined banks became the United States' 12th largest bank with asset of $42 billion. During that year Irving had been trying to participate in a friendly merger with Banca Commerciale Italiana.\n\n"}
{"id": "2230606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230606", "title": "Equatorial Counter Current", "text": "Equatorial Counter Current\n\nThe Equatorial Counter Current is an eastward flowing, wind-driven current which extends to depths of 100-150m in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. More often called the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), this current flows west-to-east at about 3-10°N in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Pacific basins, between the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and the South Equatorial Current (SEC). The NECC is not to be confused with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) that flows eastward along the equator at depths around 200m in the western Pacific rising to 100m in the eastern Pacific. \n\nIn the Indian Ocean, circulation is dominated by the impact of the reversing Asian monsoon winds. As such, the current tends to reverse hemispheres seasonally in that basin. \nThe NECC has a pronounced seasonal cycle in the Atlantic and Pacific, reaching maximum strength in late boreal summer and fall and minimum strength in late boreal winter and spring. Furthermore, the NECC in the Atlantic disappears in late winter and early spring. \n\nThe NECC is an interesting case because while it results from wind-driven circulation, it transports water against the mean westward wind stress in the tropics. This apparent paradox is concisely explained by Sverdrup theory, which shows that the east-west transport is governed by the north-south change in the curl of the wind stress.\n\nThe Pacific NECC is also known to be stronger during warm episodes of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Klaus Wyrtki, who first reported this connection, suggested that a stronger than normal NECC could be the cause of an El Niño because of the extra volume of warm water it carried eastwards.\n\nThere is also a South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) that transports water from west to east in the Pacific and Atlantic basins between 2°S and 5°S in the western basin and farther south toward the east. While the SECC is geostrophic in nature, the physical mechanism for its appearance is less clear than with the NECC; that is, Sverdrup theory does not obviously explain its existence. Additionally, the seasonal cycle of the SECC is not as defined as that of the NECC.\n\nThe NECC is a direct response to the meridional changes in the coriolis parameter and the wind stress curl near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In part the NECC owes its existence to the fact that the ITCZ is not located at the equator, rather several degrees of latitude to the north. The rapid relative change in the coriolis parameter (a function of latitude) near the equator combined with the ITCZ being located north of the equator leads to similar rapid changes in the surface Ekman transport of the ocean and areas of convergence and divergence in the oceanic mixed layer. Using the larger Pacific basin as an example, the resulting dynamic height pattern consists of a trough at the equator, and ridge near 5° degrees north, a trough at 10°N, and finally a ridge closer to 20°N.\nFrom geostrophy (the perfect balance between the mass field and velocity field), the NECC is located between the ridge and trough at 5°N and 10°N, respectively.\n\nSverdrup theory succinctly summarizes this phenomenon mathematically by defining a geostrophic mass transport per unit latitude, M, as the east-west integral of the meridional derivative of wind stress curl, minus any Ekman transport. The Ekman transport into the current is typically negligible, at least in the Pacific NECC. The total NECC is found by simply integrating M over the relevant latitudes.\n\nThe Atlantic NECC consists of the eastward zonal transport of water between 3°N and 9°N, with typical widths on the order of 300 km. The Atlantic NECC is unique among the equatorial currents in that basin because of its extreme seasonality. The maximum eastward flow is attained in late boreal summer and fall while the countercurrent is replaced by westward flow in late winter and spring. The NECC has maximum transport of approximately 40 Sv (10^6 m3/s) at 38°W. Transport reaches 30 Sv two months per year at 44°W, while farther east at 38°W the transport reaches that level five months per year. The magnitude of the NECC weakens substantially east of 38°W due to water being absorbed by the westward equatorial current south of 3°N.\n\nWhile the variability of the Atlantic NECC is dominated by the annual cycle (weak late winter, strong late summer), there is also interannual variability as well. The strength of the Atlantic NECC is notably stronger in years following El Niño in the tropical Pacific, with 1983 and 1987 being notable examples. Physically, this implies that the altered convection in the Pacific Ocean due to El Niño drives changes in the meridional gradient of wind stress curl over the equatorial Atlantic.\n\nThe Pacific NECC is a major eastward moving surface current that transports more than 20 Sv from the West Pacific warm pool to the cooler east Pacific. In the western Pacific the countercurrent is centred near 5°N while in the central Pacific it is located near 7°N. \n\nAt the surface, the current is located on the southern slope of the North Equatorial Trough, a region of low sea level which extends from east to west across the Pacific. The low sea level is a result of Ekman suction caused by the increased easterly winds found just to the north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In the western basin, the NECC may merge with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) below the surface. Generally, the current weakens to the east in the basin, with estimated flows of 21 Sv, 14.2 Sv, and 12 Sv in the western, central, and eastern Pacific, respectively.\n\nLike the Atlantic NECC, the Pacific NECC undergoes an annual cycle. This is a result of the annual Rossby wave.\nEarly each year increased winds in the eastern Pacific generate a region of lower sea level. Over the following months this propagates westward as an oceanic Rossby wave. Its fastest component, near 6°N, reaches the western Pacific around mid-summer. At higher latitudes the wave travels more slowly. As a result in the western Pacific the NECC tends to be weaker than normal in the boral winter and spring, and stronger than normal in the summer and autumn.\n\nThe Pacific NECC is known to be stronger during classic El Niño events, when there is an anomalous warming of the eastern and central Pacific that peaks in the boreal winter. Klaus Wyrtki was the first to report the connection, in the early 1970s, based on analysis of tide-gauge measurements at Pacific island stations on either side of the current. On the basis of this analysis, Wyrtki hypothesized that such an unusually strong NECC in the western Pacific would lead to an anomalous accumulation of warm water of the coast of Central America and thus an El Niño.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2230644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230644", "title": "Diadectidae", "text": "Diadectidae\n\nDiadectidae is an extinct family of early tetrapods that lived in what is now North America and Europe during the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, and in Asia during the Late Permian. They were the first herbivorous tetrapods, and also the first fully terrestrial animals to attain large sizes. Footprints indicate that diadectids walked with an erect posture. They were the first to exploit plant material in terrestrial food chains, making their appearance an important stage in both vertebrate evolution and the development of terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nThe best known and largest representative of the family is \"Diadectes\", a heavily built animal that attained a maximum length of several metres. Several other genera and various fragmentary fossil remains are also known. Although well known genera like \"Diadectes\" first appear in the Late Pennsylvanian, fragmentary remains of possible diadectids are known from much earlier deposits, including a piece of lower jaw found in Mississippian strata from Tennessee.\n\nDiadectids have large bodies with relatively short limbs. The rib cage is barrel-shaped to accommodate a large digestive tract necessary for the digestion of cellulose in plants. The skulls of diadectids are wide and deep with blunt snouts. The internal nares (holes for the nostrils) are also short. Paleontologist E.C. Case compared diadectids to turtles in 1907, noting their large pectoral girdles, short, strong limbs, and robust skulls. Case described them as \"lowly, sluggish, inoffensive herbivorous reptiles, clad in an armor of plate to protect them from the fiercely carnivorous pelycosaurs.\"\n\nDiadectids have a heterodont dentition, meaning that their teeth vary in shape along the length of the jaws. The teeth are wide and bear many cusps or projections, an indication that diadectids ate tough plants. Some teeth are leaf-shaped and laterally compressed, another indication that diadectids were able to shred plant material. The procumbent front teeth of the lower jaw project forward. Diadectids likely had strong jaw muscles for processing plant material; the placement of the jaw joints above or below the level of the occlusal plane (the plane at which the teeth come together) would have given diadectid jaws mechanical advantage. The joints themselves give the jaws a complex range of movement suitable for consuming plants. Large holes and cavities in the skull called adductor chambers and temporal openings would have provided room for large jaw-closing muscles. A ridge on the dentary bone of the lower jaw may have provided a surface for chewing or even supported a beak.\n\nThe first diadectid to be described was \"Diadectes\". American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope named the genus in 1878 on the basis of several vertebrae and teeth from the Early Permian of Texas. Cope erected the family Diadectidae in 1880 to include \"Diadectes\" and \"Empedocles\", a genus he named two years earlier. \"Nothodon\", named by Cope's rival Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, was soon placed in the family.\n\nCope named several other diadectids, including \"Helodectes\" in 1880, \"Chilonyx\" and \"Empedias\" in 1883, and \"Bolbodon\" in 1896. Paleontologist E.C. Case named four other diadectids: \"Desmatodon\" in 1908, \"Diasparactus\" in 1910, \"Diadectoides\" in 1911, and \"Animasaurus\" along with paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1912. Case and Williston considered Marsh's \"Nothodon\" and Cope's \"Bolbodon\" to be synonymous with \"Diadectes\". Marsh named \"Nothodon\" in the \"American Journal of Science\" only five days before Cope described \"Diadectes\" in \"Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society\". Under rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the name \"Nothodon\" would have priority over \"Diadectes\", but because the name \"Diadectes\" has been in use since Case and Williston first synonymized the genera, \"Diadectes\" remains the accepted name.\n\nIn North America, diadectids are known from Texas, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Prince Edward Island. A possible diadectid has also been found from Tennessee. It is known from a broken lower jaw and several teeth found in Mississippian-age (Chesterian) strata that are likely part of the Bangor Formation. In a detailed review of Diadectidae, paleontologist E.C. Olson placed three North American genera within the family: \"Diadectes\", \"Diasparactus\", and \"Desmatodon\". \"Chilonyx\", \"Empedias\", \"Diadectoides\", and \"Animasaurus\" were synonymized with \"Diadectes\", and four species of \"Diadectes\" (\"D. sideropelicus\", \"D. tenuitectes\", \"D. lentus\", and \"D. carinatus\") were recognized. A fourth genus, \"Ambedus\", was named in 2004 from the Early Permian of Ohio.\nDiadectids are also known from Germany. \"Phanerosaurus\" was described from several vertebrae near Zwickau by German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1860, but was not recognized as a diadectid until 1925. A second species of \"Phanerosaurus\" was identified from some vertebrae and a fragmentary skull in 1882, and was given its own genus, \"Stephanospondylus\", in 1905. In 1998, a new species of \"Diadectes\", \"D. absitus\", was described from the Bromacker sandstone quarry of the Tambach Formation in the Thuringian Forest of central Germany. A new genus of diadectid called \"Orobates\" was also named from the Bromacker Quarry in 2004.\n\nIn 2015, the known geographic range of diadectids was expanded with the description of a new genus and species of diadectid from China, \"Alveusdectes fenestralis\". \"Alveusdectes\" is also the youngest known diadectid by 16 million years, coming from a unit of the Late Permian Shangshihezi Formation that dates to about 256 million years.\n\nDiadectids have long been considered close relatives of the amniotes, tetrapods that lay eggs on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother. In 1987, the paleontologist D.M.S. Watson placed the family in the larger group Diadectomorpha, which includes another family of large-bodied diadectomorphs, the Limnoscelidae, as well as the monotypic diadectomorph family Tseajaiidae, represented by the genus \"Tseajaia\". Throughout the twentieth century, amniotes and diadectomorphs were often grouped together using the old name Cotylosauria, a name originally used for the most basal grade of what was then thought to be reptiles. In the early part of the century, many paleontologists regarded diadectids, along with other cotylosaurs (such as placodonts), to be close relatives of turtles. In most recent studies of early tetrapod phylogeny, Cotylosauria is no longer recognized and Diadectomorpha is placed as the sister taxon of Amniota. However, while the majority of analyses now place diadectids outside Amniota, some have found them to be true amniotes.\n\nMost phylogenetic studies of the three diadectomorph families – Diadectidae, Limnoscelidae, and Tseajaiidae – have found diadectids and limnoscelids to be more closely related to each other than either is to \"Tseajaia\". In other words, Diadectidae and Limnoscelidae form a clade within Diadectomorpha and \"Tseajaia\" is excluded from the clade. In a 2010 phylogenetic analysis, Diadectidae formed a clade that was characterized by wide cheek teeth with cusps on either side. Unlike previous studies, it was found to be more closely related to Tseajaiidae than Limnoscelidae. The family was defined as \"Diadectes\" and all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with \"Diadectes\" than with \"Tseajaia\". Below is a cladogram modified from the 2010 analysis:\n\n\"Diadectes\" is the best known diadectid, with six species named since its initial description. In a 2005 phylogenetic analysis, most species of \"Diadectes\" formed a clade with \"Diasparactus zenos\". Two species, \"Diadectes absitus\" and \"Diadectes sanmiguelensis\", were placed in more basal positions. These species possess primitive characteristics found in non-diadectid forms, such as \"Limnoscelis\" and \"Tseajaia\". Because \"D. absitus\" and \"D. sanmiguelensis\" were placed far from other species of \"Diadectes\" in the analysis, their assignment to the genus was questioned. The same results were found in the 2010 analysis. Two new genera were erected in the study to include \"D. abstus\" and \"D. sanmiguelensis\". \"D. sanmiguelensis\", the more basal of the two forms, was placed in the new genus \"Oradectes\". \"D. abstus\" was renamed \"Silvadectes\".\n\nDiadectids were some of the first tetrapods, or four-legged vertebrates, to attain large sizes. Diadectids first appear in the Late Carboniferous with the genus \"Desmatodon\", although recently described bones from Tennessee suggest that they may have appeared even earlier in the Early Carboniferous. They underwent a small evolutionary radiation in the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, diversifying into thirteen species and outnumbering other diadectomorphs, such as the limnoscelids. This radiation was likely the result of diadectids' expansion into a new herbivorous ecological niche that was previously unfilled.\n\nDiadectids had a much wider geographic distribution than their relatives; while the distribution of limnoscelids is limited to parts of North America and \"Tseajaia\" is restricted to just the southwestern United States, diadectids are present in North America, Europe, and Asia. During the late Carboniferous and Permian these regions formed a single landmass called Laurasia, which comprised the northern portion of the supercontinent Pangea. For most of their evolutionary history, diadectids were likely limited to the western half of Laurasia, which is now North America and Europe. The presence of the late-surviving \"Alveusdectes\" in China suggests that diadectids radiated eastward across Laurasia. They could not have reached what is now China until the Middle Permian because, prior to that time, the Tethys Sea separated it from the rest of Laurasia. The group does not seem to have diversified to the same extent in the east as they did in the west given that no diadectids are known from Russia, which has an extensive fossil record of Early and Middle Permian tetrapod assemblages.\n\nDiadectids were the first fully herbivorous tetrapods. Although several other groups of early tetrapods independently acquired herbivory, diadectids were the only Carboniferous tetrapods that were able to process high-fiber terrestrial plants. Diadectids were also the most diverse group of herbivores, representing the first radiation of plant-eating tetrapods. Both Cope and Marsh recognized that diadectids were herbivores in 1878 when they studied their distinctively broad, cusped teeth (in his description of \"Diadectes\", Cope mentioned, \"animals belonging to this genus were, in all probability, herbivorous\").\n\nDiadectids were once thought to be sprawling animals with their short, robust legs positioned to the sides of their large bodies. Despite this, several lines of evidence, including trackways and limb morphology, suggest that diadectids moved in a more erect posture. While earlier tetrapods possess several simple tarsal bones in their ankles, diadectids have a more complex astragalus formed from the fusion of these bones. Astragali are present in terrestrial amniotes and are identical in structure to those of diadectids. Therefore, the ankle structure of diadectids bears a closer resemblance to those of advanced terrestrial vertebrates like mammals and reptiles than those of earlier tetrapods. Since diadectids are the only diadectomorphs with astragali, they likely developed the structure independent of amniotes.\n\nAlthough they bear similarities to those of amniotes, the tarsal bones of diadectids are poorly ossified and loosely connected. The digits of the foot connect only to the fourth distal tarsal, providing a wide range of movement in the foot. This flexibility enabled diadectids to rotate their feet in a forward position while walking, providing greater force when pushing off. The feet could also be placed closer to the midline of the body to give diadectids an erect stance.\n\nEvidence for an erect stance can be found in trackways attributed to diadectids. The most well-preserved of these trackways are present in the Tambach Formation in central Germany. A 2007 study identified two different ichnospecies, \"Ichniotherium cottae\" and \"I. sphaerodactylum\", as footprints of the diadectids \"Silvadectes absitus\" and \"Orobates pabsti\", respectively. This was the first species-level identification of trackmakers of Paleozoic-era trackways, making the footprints the oldest yet associated with specific animal species. The close positioning of the footprints attributed to the more advanced diadectides suggests that the animals held their feet almost underneath their bodies, giving them a more efficient gait and to some degree paralleling the stance of mammals more than that of the sprawling amphibians and reptiles.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230677", "title": "Li He", "text": "Li He\n\nLi He ( – ) was a Chinese poet of the mid-Tang dynasty. His courtesy name was Changji, and he is also known as Guicai and Shigui.\n\nHe was prevented from taking the imperial examination due to a naming taboo. He died very young, and was noted for his sickly appearance.\n\nHe was a diligent poet, going out on journeys during the day and, when a line of poetry came to him, jotting it down, and completing the poems when he arrived home in the evening. His poems famously explored ghostly, supernatural and fantastic themes.\n\nHis popularity and place in the Chinese literary canon has fluctuated throughout the centuries. His idiosyncratic style of poetry was frequently imitated in China until the Qing era. During this era, the popularity of his poetry suffered from a change in literary tastes, with his works notably being excluded from the influential \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\", but there was a revival of interest in him in the twentieth century. He was among the Tang poets most admired by Mao Zedong.\n\nChapter 137 of the \"Old Book of Tang\" and chapter 203 of the \"New Book of Tang\" each give a brief outline of the biography of Li He.\n\nLi Shangyin, a poet of the following generation, also wrote a \"Short Biography of Li He\". Du Mu, in 831, wrote a preface to Li's collected poems (), which is more removed than the affectionate account written by Li Shangyin, but provides very little biographical information and is more focused on Li's appeal as a poet. Both the official histories are heavily dependent on these earlier records, particularly on Li Shangyin's account.\n\nHis family were of distant royal descent (from the Li family who were the ruling dynastic family of the Tang Dynasty), but his branch's fortunes had declined early on, and by Li He's time they were of low rank. Both the Tang state histories refer to him as a \"descendant of Zheng Wang\", but there is dispute as to the identity of Zheng Wang. The theory with more support among scholars is that it refers to Zheng Xiao Wang Liang (), an uncle of Li Yuan, the first Tang emperor; another theory is that it refers to the thirteenth son of Li Yuan, Zheng Wang Yuan Yi ().\n\nHe was born in 790 or 791. It seems likely that he was born in the year of the Horse, as some twenty-three of his surviving poems use the horse as a symbol for the poet.\n\nHe was a native of Fuchang County (west of modern-day Yiyang County, Henan Province).\n\nHe started composing poetry at the age of 7, and by around 15 he was being compared to the \"yuefu\" master Li Yi.\n\nWhen Li was 20, he attempted to take the Imperial Examination, but was forbidden from doing so because of a naming taboo: the first character (晉 \"jin\") of his father's given name (晉肅 \"Jinsu\") was a homonym of the first character () of Jinshi (), the name of the degree that would have been conferred on him had he passed. Ueki et al. (1999) speculate that this was a pretext devised by rivals, who were jealous of his poetic skill, to prevent him from sitting the examination.\n\nHan Yu, who admired his poetry, wrote \"Hui Bian\" () to encourage him to take the exam, but Li was ultimately unsuccessful. He served only three years, in the low-ranking office of \"Fenglilang\" () before returning to his hometown.\n\nHe is described as having a very sickly appearance: he was supposedly very thin, had a unibrow, and let his fingernails grow long. Li He died a low-ranking and poor official in 816 or 817, at the age of 26 or 27. The \"Short Biography of Li He\" reports that at the hour of his death he was visited by a figure in scarlet who told him that Shangdi had summoned him to heaven to write poetry.\n\nHis courtesy name was Changji, and he is also known by a combination of his surname and courtesy name, Li Changji.\n\nHe was also known as \"Guicai\" (鬼才 \"devilish talent\") by contrast of his morbid poetic style to Li Bai's \"Tiancai\" (天才 \"heavenly talent\") and Bai Juyi's \"Rencai\" (人才 \"humanly talent\"). This title was given him by the Song scholar Qian Yi () in his work \"Nanbu Xinshu\" ().\n\nHe was also dubbed the \"Ghost of Poetry\" (), while Li Bai was called the \"Immortal of Poetry\" () and Du Fu the \"Sage of Poetry\" ().\n\nIn literary history, Li is generally considered a poet of the so-called Middle Tang period, which spanned the late-eighth and early-ninth centuries. Among his poetic influences were his older contemporary Meng Jiao and the aforementioned Han Yu. Other sources that have been identified as influencing Li's poetry were the shamanistic elements of the \"Chu Ci\" and the idiosyncratic poetry of Li Bai.\n\nAbout 240 of his poems survive. The \"New Book of Tang\" reports that few of his poems survived because of their strangeness and because of Li's early death. An anecdote in the \"Taiping Guangji\" records that a cousin of Li's was asked to compile a collection of his poems, but because he did not like Li personally he eventually threw what had been collected in the privy.\n\nThere are two extant anthologies of his poems: the \"Collected Songs and Verses of Li He\" () and the \"Wai Ji\" ().\n\nThe \"Short Biography of Li He\" describes him as a diligent poet, who carried an old brocade bag around with him, and when a line of poetry came to him he would jot it down and put it in this bag. After getting home, he would arrange these lines into a poem.\n\nHis poetry is unique, filled with fantastic and unusual imagery, which is where he gets his nickname \"Guicai\" (see above). Virtually none of his surviving poems are in regulated verse form, and his poems make frequent use of inauspicious words such as \"aging\" () and \"death\" (). In poems like \"Tianshang yao\" and \"Meng tian\", he wrote evocatively of the worlds of gods and Buddhas.\n\nHe also gave eerie descriptions of the world of ghosts in his poems \"Qiu lai\" and \"Shen xian qu\". The spiritual symbolism Li employed in the latter poem has been called \"nearly impenetrable\".\n\n\"Shen xian qu\" was the name of a popular folk song going back at least as far as the Six Dynasties period, and Li's poem borrows the name of this song. The song originated in the Nanjing area, as a ritual song meant to be played at religious ceremonies to invite the favour of the gods. Li's poem describes the supernatural world but this is not the case with the original folk song.\n\nHe frequently combined colour and feeling imagery in his poetry, as can be seen in his poems \"Tianshang yao\" (see above) and \"Qin wang yin jiu\".\n\nHis poetic style was dubbed \"Changji-ti\" () by later critics, after his courtesy name. The Song commentator Yan Yu listed this as one of the individual author-based styles of poetry that was frequently imitated.\nSeveral modern western and Japanese critics, including A. C. Graham, Naotarō Kudō and J. D. Frodsham, have claimed that Li's poetry was not widely read until the modern era, but this is not entirely accurate. In a 1994 survey, Wu Qiming pointed out that Li was in premodern China more subject to imitation than to neglect.\n\nTwo poets of the generation following Li He, Du Mu and Li Shangyin, commemorated Li in their prose writings: a preface to Li's collected poems and a short biography of Li, respectively. Du Mu's preface in particular is taken as proof that Li's poetry was being compiled and edited within a few decades of his death, as internal textual evidence dates the preface to 831. The Tang author Pi Rixiu also wrote about Li He's poetry alongside that of Li Bai in his critical work \"Liu Zao Qiang Bei\" ().\n\nHe was also one of a group of Tang poets frequently quoted in the lyrics of Song-era musicians such as Zhou Bangyan (1056–1121). Yan Yu, in his work \"Canglang Shihua\", contrasted Li to the earlier poet Li Bai. The earliest surviving edition of Li's poetry was collected and annotated in the Southern Song dynasty.\n\nMany \"shi\" poets of the Yuan dynasty emulated Li's poetic style. These included Cheng Tinggui (), Yang Weizhen, and Gu Ying (), as well as the early Ming poet Gao Qi.\n\nThe Ming scholar Hu Yinglin read Li's poetry politically as \"the tones of a ruined state\" and recognized that Li's poetic style was especially influential during the latter years of various dynasties.\n\nThere was an upswing in popularity of Li's poetry from the late Ming to the mid-Qing dynasties. A great many newly annotated collections of Li's poetry appeared during this period, and his poetry was widely imitated. The scholar wrote a five-volume commentary on his poetry.\n\nAround the mid-Qing dynasty, though, Li's poetry began to fall out of favour with the literary establishment. The anthologist Shen Deqian included a scant ten of Li's poems in his influential work \"\". Shen was highly critical of his contemporaries' tendency to imitate Li's poetry. Li's poetry was also conspicuously absent from the \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\", the arbiter of poetic tastes in the late Qing and early twentieth century.\n\nAlong with Li Bai and Li Shangyin, Li He was one of the \"Three Lis\" () admired by Mao Zedong. In 1968, Roger Waters of the rock band Pink Floyd borrowed lines from Li's poetry to create the lyrics for the song \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\".\n\nIn his article on Li for the \"Chūgoku Bunkashi Daijiten\", Japanese sinologist Kazuyuki Fukazawa called him \"the representative poet of the Middle Tang\". According to French sinologist François Jullien, Li He's poetry was readmitted to the Chinese literary canon \"at the end of the nineteenth century ... [when] ... Western notions of romanticism [allowed] the Chinese to reexamine this poet, allowing the symbolism of his poems to speak at last, freeing his imaginary world from the never-ending quest for insinuations.\" Paul W. Kroll, in his chapter on Tang poetry for \"The Columbia History of Chinese Literature\", called Li \"[t]he most eccentric poet of the T'ang, perhaps in all of Chinese poetry\", and dubbed him \"the Chinese Mallarmé\" for his almost inscrutable poetic style and use of imagery.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230701", "title": "Ornate hawk-eagle", "text": "Ornate hawk-eagle\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle (\"Spizaetus ornatus\") is a fairly large bird of prey from the tropical Americas. Formerly, some authorities referred to this species as the crested hawk-eagle, a name that may cause some confusion as it is more commonly used for an Asian eagle species. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae. This species has a feathered tarsus that marks it as a member of the \"Aquilinae\" or booted eagle subfamily. This species is notable for the vivid colors and bold markings of adults, which differ considerably from the far more whitish plumage of the juvenile bird. The ornate hawk-eagle ranges from central Mexico south through much of Central America and in a somewhat spotty but broad overall range into South America, including in the west apart from the Andes and broadly on the Atlantic side especially Brazil down to as far as Southeast Brazil and northern Argentina. This species is found largely in primary forests with tall trees, although can be found in many forest types. The ornate hawk-eagle female lays almost always a single egg and the species has a fairly prolonged breeding cycle like many tropical raptors, especially due to a lengthy post-fledging stage on which juveniles are dependent on their parents. It a diversified and exceptionally powerful predator which takes a range of prey, usually led by various medium-to-large-sized birds and small-to-medium-sized mammals as well as occasional reptiles. Like many forest-dependent raptors, especially those in the tropical and subtropical regions, this species is likely under the pressing threat of deforestation. The decline of forest habitat in this species range, especially the Amazon rainforest, led the IUCN to uplist the ornate hawk-eagle as Near Threatened in 2016.\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle is a member of the booted eagle subfamily, with the signature well-feathered tarsus present on both tropical and temperate species (and shared, presumably through convergent evolution, with a pair of buteonine hawks). It is one of four living members of the \"Spizaetus\" species of “hawk-eagle” native to the neotropics. At one time Old World hawk-eagles, native to various southern areas of Asia, were also included in the \"Spizaetus\" genus. However, genetic studies have shown the Asian group of species to be paraphyletic, resulting in the Old World members being placed in \"Nisaetus\" (Hodgson, 1836) and separated from the New World species. The history of the American \"Spizaetus\" genus has been indicated by the diversity of hawk-eagles found in the fossil records in the United States and Mexico. At least five such species have been described, having presumably radiated from basal hawk-eagles of Asian origin across the Bering Land Bridge. Studies have indicated that some of these are ancestors of modern \"Spizaetus\" species, with the genera having been present in North America at least since the Pliocene. Some forms were considerably more massive than any extant hawk-eagle and indeed were likely to have exceeded the size of any living booted eagle. Fossil species such as \"Spizaetus willetti\" may have grown to similar sizes as the modern harpy eagle (\"Harpia harpyja\").\n\nStudies based on the genetic markers indicated the black-and-white hawk-eagle (\"Spizaetus melanoleucus\") and, especially, the black-and-chestnut eagle (\"Spizaetus isidori\") are closely related to the ornate hawk-eagle, resulting in their respective former genera of \"Spizastur\" and \"Oroaetus\" being eliminated. The fourth neotropical hawk-eagle, the black hawk-eagle (\"Spizaetus tyrannus\"), has been found to be basal to the other extant species. Per genetic research, the ornate hawk-eagle and black-and-chestnut eagle are considered as sister species. The ornate hawk-eagle has been diagnosed to include two subspecies. The nominate subspecies (\"S. o. ornatus\") occupies a good deal of the South American range of the species, including eastern Colombia, Venezuela and all of the species range in Brazil and points south. The second subspecies, \"S. o. vicarius\", has been described to inhabit the discontinuous northern part of the range, extending from Mexico and Central America down through much of western Colombia and western Ecuador down as far south as El Oro. The subspecies seem to differ mostly in the plumage characteristics of adults. Whereas nominate birds are a more cinnamon-hued color on the neck with slightly paler ground color and sparser markings about the head and undersides, \"S. o. vicarius\", tends to be darker overall, with a richer, deeper more rufous color around the neck, denser and darker markings overall and broader bands on the tail.\n\nThis is a medium-to-large sized species of raptor but a fairly small eagle. In the ornate hawk-eagle, the sexes are similar in appearance and overlap in size but like most birds of prey do show reverse sexual dimorphism, in which females outsize males to the contrary of most non-raptorial birds. The biggest female ornate hawk-eagles are 13% larger than biggest males, with an average of about 8% greater in nominate race. In Central America, in extreme cases, the largest females are as much as 50% heavier than the smallest males. The species is slightly smaller than the largest members of widespread raptor genera such as the largest \"Buteo\" and \"Falco\" species but is usually larger than other forest raptors in its range apart from vultures and other eagle species. The total length of full grown ornate hawk-eagle is . Average total length is estimated at for males and for females. The wingspan may range from . Body mass can vary in males from and in females from . The average weight of five adult males was while another five males averaged . The average weight of four adult females was while a sample of 11 averaged . Among standard measurements, wing chord measures from in males and against \"S. o. vicarius\" in which wing chord is known to measure in males and . In tail length, males vary from and females from . The culmen from cere measures in males and . In tarsus length, males may measure and females may measure . Average wing chord lengths from Guatemala (\"S. o. vicarius\"), showed 7 males to average and 8 females to average . Meanwhile, in the same sample, mean tail length was in males and in females and mean tarsus length was and in the sexes, respectively. The largest rear talon (or hallux claw) present on all accipitrids (usually the main killing tool in these predator's arsenal) is particularly enlarged on the ornate hawk-eagle relative to its size, averaging about in males and in females from Guatemala, with an average foot span for both sexes measuring around .\n\nOrnate hawk-eagles largely perch within the tree canopy, but will sometimes be out on exposed branches especially earlier in the morning. Usually soaring activity peaks in the late morning. Brown & Amadon (1986) described the species are “rather stolid and buteonine, despite the long tail and crest”. Adults are largely distinguishable by their rufous cowls and bold barring below. Furthermore, all ornate hawk-eagles bear a long erectile crest, which may variously be laid flat against the head, protrude straight up like a spike or sometimes hang at a slight curve. Adults when perched have an obvious black crown, crest and malar stripes (continuing to sides as isolated streaks) sets off by the rufous color on their cheeks, ear-coverts and sides of the neck and chest (sometimes completely covering their upper chests), the rufous shading into a somewhat browner rufous nape. On the upperside, they are barred blackish to dark brown with usually apparent white tips on the mantle and lesser wing coverts. Meanwhile, on the underside, they have a whitish base color which, other than the often plain throat, is boldly overlaid with black barring. This barring extends down to the abdomen and legs, while the crissum is spotted black. Like many forest raptors, the species has relatively short wings and a longish tail. When perched, their wing tips slightly exceed their tail base. The tail is blackish with a creamy whitish tip and three broad pale bands, which are greyish above and whitish below, the basal bar often being obscured. According to Brown & Amadon “the perched bird seemingly has legs set very far forward, almost under the chest, thus giving the impression of posed readiness. The position of the black crest hints at the bird's temper at the moment”. Juvenile differ conspicuously in many respects, generally lacking most of the pigment visible in adults. Juveniles lack the adults’ rufous collar, malar stripes and underside barring. Instead, the juvenile's whole head and underparts are white excepting thin black streaks on the crown and the tip of their crest. Some juvenile ornate hawk-eagles do, however, show variable, light dark brown barring and spotting on the flanks and thighs, at even may manifest a vestigial moustache on the face. The juvenile's back and wings are dark brown with white-tipped blackish shoulders. The tail is somewhat similar to the adult's but has a broader white tip and at least 4-5 thinner bands, which like those of the adult are greyish above and whitish below. By their 2nd year, the young hawk-eagles enter an intermediate or subadult plumage that quickly starts to resemble that of the adults but is rather more faded in appearance. The subadult's face is a sandy to pale rufous color with an indistinct malar stripe, while the flanks, belly and legs increasingly start to manifest barring and spotting. The subadult's back is still largely dark brown but tends to appear increasingly blackish. Adults have orangish-yellow eyes, with a dull greenish to grey color on the cere and bare lores, while the feet are rich cream to pale yellow. Juveniles have white to whitish-yellow eyes, a yellow to bluish-grey cere and brighter yellow to orange feet. Apparently, the legs of juveniles are often less thickly feathered than those of adults.\n\nIn flight it may appear intermediate in size, being large relative to most forest raptors but rather small and slender-bodied for an eagle. The flying ornate hawk-eagle is prominent headed with short, broad rounded wings that show an emphasis on the bulging secondaries and pinch in at the bases of the trailing edges. Flight of the species is deep and powerful with the wings held flattish and pressed slightly forward, while the tail may be closed to slightly spread. From above, adult has a rufous cowl, a blackish mantle and a slightly brownish black back and wings with white-tipped shoulders and tail coverts. Below the underwing is paler looking relative to body with flecking or speckling only on the hand and thinly barred flight feathers. In flight, the juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is mainly dark brown above with whitish scaled blackish-brown shoulders. Below, the juvenile's wings have scattered spots on the axillaries and great wing-coverts, blackish tips to the white based outer primaries and thin barring on the other flight feathers, at times matching the patterning of the tail. By the 2nd year, there is an only moderate increase to the flecks and spots on the wing linings, as the flight feathers and tail are the last to molt away from the juvenile-like look to those like adults.\n\nWhile adult ornate hawk-eagles are obviously distinctly marked from most other raptors, one species strikingly resembles this predator, the juvenile of the gray-bellied hawk (\"Accipiter poliogaster\") which is extremely different looking from the respective plumage of adult gray-bellieds. While not definitely proven, this is quite possibly a case of mimicry, as is known in other raptor assemblages wherein a less powerful species (the hawk) mimics a more powerful species (the hawk-eagle) presumably to mitigate potential predatory attacks. Distant gray-bellied hawks are best told apart by their very different proportions and build both in flight and perched. The gray-bellied hawks are typical of an \"Accipiter\", having broader and much shorter wings, relatively more elongated tail and signature flap-flap-glide flight style. Although the gray-bellied hawk is by a slight margin the largest member of that genus in South America, it is still considerably smaller than the hawk-eagle, averaging about a third smaller in length. At close range, it may noticeably differ, beyond the size discrepancy, by the hawk being crestless and bearing relatively long, featherless and yellow legs. Black hawk-eagles are fairly similarly shaped and similarly sized as the ornate hawk-eagle when seen in flight but are slightly larger in appearance, being longer tailed and longer winged. Nonetheless, the ornate hawk-eagle usually is slightly heavier on average than the black hawk-eagle and may appear chestier in perched birds than the more gracile black species. Confusion with the adult black hawk-eagle is unlikely given that it is always much darker, appear solidly soot colored apart from its heavily barred wings. Juveniles and late first years stages of the black hawk-eagle are most likely to be confused in distant flight with perhaps a subadult ornate, however the juvenile black hawk-eagle is always much more heavily barred below with dark cheeks separating the white supericilia and throat. Haverschmidt (1968) mentioned a \"dark morph\" of the ornate hawk-eagle that he said was \"nearly impossible\" to distinguish from the black hawk-eagle but this is considered most likely to have been a misidentified black hawk-eagle in intermediate plumage. The juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is potentially confusable with the black-and-white hawk-eagle but the latter is smaller with boxier wings, shorter crest, a bold orange cere, a strong black mask and a blacker upper-body with white leading edges. Also the black-and-white bears no spots or barring on its wings and has a plain white underbody. The black-and-white species is more similar to an \"Accipiter\" in proportions than the ornate species, having relatively less expansive wings and somewhat more elongated looking tail. Juveniles are told from the similar juvenile black-and-chestnut eagle by their smaller size and by having more extensive spots and barring on the under wing (giving the differences in altitudinal range, overlap in distribution is likely very minimal). Juvenile hook-billed kite (\"Chondrohierax uncinatus\") are also potentially confusable with juvenile ornates but the kite is much smaller and more dumpily built with more paddle-shaped wings, a squarer tail, with clearer bars on remiges and rectrices and bare tarsi. Another kite, the gray-headed kite (\"Leptodon cayanensis\") can be considered similar in plumage in its adult plumage to the juvenile ornate but it is rather smaller with very different shape in all respects (especially in its small, pigeon-like head), completely different underwing pattern and unmarked body but for grey crown and nape. Pale juvenile crested eagles (\"Morphnus guianensis\") appear much larger and longer tailed than juvenile ornate hawk-eagles with dark grey rather than dark brown backs, unbarred flanks and have a less marked hand in flight contrasting with more boldly barred primary quills. Despite the ornate species not infrequently being described as “slim”, in actuality, the much bigger looking crested eagle is much lighter for its size and only averages about 30% heavier than the ornate (i.e. other eagle species around the same total length as the crested eagle weigh about three times as much as the ornate species). Despite its somewhat similar plumage and appearance to the crested eagle, the harpy eagle is far more massive than the ornate hawk-eagle (nearly five times heavier on average) and unlikely to be confused with any plumage of the smaller species.\n\nThe main call known for the ornate hawk-eagle is a series of loud piping whistles. It is emitted by the soaring bird, usually male, and is often transcribed as \"whi whee-whee-wheep\", the \"whee\" repeated anywhere from 2 to 9 times. Numerous variations are known are given in terms of transcription but most sources describe in roughly similar ways. Unlike the call of the black hawk-eagle, similarly done in flying display, the ornate hawk-eagle the introductory series of notes is more hurried and the last note more drawn out. It has been noted by some authors that the ornate species’ call in nearly a reverse of the pattern of the calling black hawk-eagle which calls \"huwee-whee-whi-whi-wi-wi-wi\", the first note being longest and slurred, second note highest, followed by descending short notes. While perched, ornate hawk-eagle may let out a \"ca-lee-oo\" followed by an accelerating series of excited sounding laughing notes. Other reported call include a \"qu-ouw\" reminiscent of a limpkin (\"Aramus guarauna\") call and a cat-like scream when disturbed. Perched juveniles have a food begging call consisting of a loud, clear whistle, which is repeatedly irregularly and transcribed as\"wheeu\" or \"wheee\". While nesting, the male when arriving with food announces his presence with a \"pitpit\" call repeated four times. The most common form of call by the female is emitted during food begging, a \"hui\" note, which is usually repeated about four times. She may also call out a sharp \"fli-fli-fli-flio\" when being mobbed by small birds. A further call was once attributed to an ornate hawk-eagle that was hunting a guan was a very deep growl, reminiscent of a big cat, to such a degree that the witnesses initially thought the guan was being pursued by a jaguar (\"Panthera onca\"). However, further analysis has indicated that it was the guan itself that had let out the big cat-like growl (possibly in an effort to startle the predator and perhaps successfully as the guan escaped) and not, in likelihood, the hawk-eagle itself.\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle has the largest distribution of the nine species of eagle endemic to the neotropics, ranging over an estimated 20.2 million square kilometers in total. This is a largely sedentary species, but some local dispersal is known to occur and individuals wander into drier forest and higher altitudes than normal. The species ranges as far north as southeastern Mexico, where it is found on the Caribbean slope from southern Tamaulipas, on Pacific more infrequently in Jalisco and east Oaxaca. In their Mexican range, their status is uncertain in Colima, where it may be extirpated. Reportage of the species is known in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Nayarit but these could pertain to wandering individuals. Nesting remains unconfirmed throughout west Mexico and since most birds seen are juveniles, these could refer to post-dispersal wanderers. The species is found almost continuously through Central America in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua into Costa Rica and Panama (including the isle of Coiba). In Panama, it is much more numerous on the more humid Caribbean side than the drier slopes of the Pacific, being especially scarce in the Panama canal zone and Azuero Peninsula, but can occur in more humid parts of the Pacific side. A similar distributional favoring of the more humid Caribbean coast has been noted elsewhere in Central America as well. In South America, the range continues locally west of the Andes (formerly at least to tropical western Ecuador), being somewhat more commonly found north and east of the Andes in Colombia, northern and central Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, eastern Ecuador and the Guianas. In Brazil, it occupies nearly two-thirds of the large country south to Paraná and marginally into Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul but is largely (if not entirely) absent from Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais and more or less the entirety of the northeast region. Their distribution continues through eastern Peru, northern, central and eastern Bolivia, southern Paraguay and northwestern (down to Tucumán) and northeastern Argentina (down to Santa Fe), though it has been wondered if the northeast occurrences are merely incidental wanderings of juveniles from adjacent populations. Despite its wide distribution, the species is frequently quite uncommon to increasingly rare in several parts of the range, though can outnumber other eagles (apart from the slightly more adaptable black hawk-eagle).\n\nThis species dwells in well forested regions, preferring tall, wet or humid, tropical and subtropical forests. Although some of the species can dwell in dry tropical forest this is usually quite secondary habitat. More so than black hawk-eagles, the ornate hawk-eagle tends to be found primarily only in unbroken primary forest tracts. Some records indicate that the ornate hawk-eagle may persist on tracts of forest down to only but usually such extensive deforestation causes the species to vacate the area. The ornate hawk-eagle may be found at sea level to , also rarely to about . However, they've been recorded wandering to in Costa Rica. The species adapts quite well to cloud forest habitat which are usually at higher elevations than typical rainforest habitats (i.e. in primary cloud forest of southern Mexico, the ornate hawk-eagle was one of the two most frequently recorded raptor species). In some areas, the hawk-eagles may occasional habituate partially to edges, riversides and other openings, also into gallery strips and relatively short swamp forest. Deciduous forests, mixed pine-oak, taller stretches of secondary forests and shade coffee plantations, as long they have tall native tree canopies, may be visited and even locally nested in, as was recorded in Mexico. In Guatemala, they are often fairly distant from openings and dwell almost entirely in primary forest, especially areas where at least one very tall tree emerged above the average canopy level and there is less forest understory to more easily execute hunting. The Guatemalan hawk-eagles preferred fairly homogenous forest in drier upland parts of the humid forest, since the hilly areas of the forest tended to have more of the aforementioned habitat characteristic. However, the hawk-eagles here did sometimes occur in scrub-swamp forests as long as it retained tall trees, however the ornate hawk-eagles who nested in scrub-swamp forest type often went to the upland areas to hunt.\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle is a powerful predator that readily varies its prey selection among two main prey groups. Largely the most significant prey for the species are medium to large sized birds. The other main prey type are a variety of small to medium-sized mammals. On occasion, reptiles may form a seldom part of the diet. This species largely forages inside forests, often perch-hunting. This entails short flights from tree to tree at mid-story heights while foraging or still-hunting from inconspicuous vantage points near the center of a dense canopy. Upon prey detection, they swoop to grasp the prey on the ground or in trees or engage in tail chases among trees. The agility imparted by its relative small and broad wings and longish tail and talent for tail-chases in enclosed woods and thickets are why this and similar eagles are referred to as “hawk-eagles”, in reference to similar hunting styles in the “true hawks” i.e. the members of the \"Accipiter\" genus. In size, tail length and hunting style, the ornate hawk-eagle in particular is quite similar to the largest races of the largest \"Accipiter\" species, the northern goshawk (\"Accipiter gentilis\"). Most witnessed tail-chases by this species have involved chasing various gamebirds, with about equal accounts of successful and unsuccessful pursuits. In Guatemala, most attacks were launched when the hawk-eagle was from its quarry, with all successful attacks on prey on ground or low bushes and were from perches at high or lower in the trees. In Manú National Park, Peru, most observed attacks were untaken within about of the prey and prey was attacked mostly on the ground, although they also captured rails from shallow water (in one case losing a gallinule rail to a nearby caiman before the hawk-eagle could carry it prey away). In attacking Guianan cock-of-the-rock (\"Rupicola rupicola\") on their mating lek, 2 of 8 attempted attacks by ornate hawk-eagles were successful (and were the only successful attacks of 56 total attempts, the other 48 by different raptor species). The hawk-eagles made bold, fast dives into the middle of the leks, quickly grabbing a male cock-of-the-rock. Subsequently, one hawk-eagle consumed the bird right on the spot in one case and the other took its catch to a nearby perch. Reported instances of “power dives” into troops of monkeys and even heronries are probably similar in nature to the cock-of-the-rock attacks. In one case, an ornate hawk-eagle was able to capture a black vulture (\"Coragyps atratus\") that had come to the carcass of a monkey that the hawk-eagle itself may have also killed. In general, a picture has emerged that the ornate hawk-eagle is a particularly opportunistic predator, attracted to conspicuous prey behaviors and less deeply searching in its foraging than most co-existing forest eagles.\n\nIn total, well over 100 prey species are known for ornate hawk-eagles. Of particularly broad import to ornate hawk-eagles are the cracid family of gamebirds such as chachalacas, guans and curassows. In fact, local names refer to this species at times as the “guan hawk” or the “curassow hawk”. At least twelve species of cracid are taken quite often where available, and this is probably only a partial list of the species they hunt. However, the ornate hawk-eagle is far from specialized on cracid prey and takes more or less any medium-sized or larger avian prey they opportune upon. In total, about 65% of recorded prey species for ornate hawk-eagles are birds. Beyond cracids, some of the most significant prey families and orders are tinamou (at least 8 species), pigeons and doves (9 species or more), toucans (at least 7 species), parrots (at least 9 species) as well as assorted non-cracid gamebirds and largish passerines. In Tikal, Guatemala, the most often identified avian prey on 10 ornate hawk-eagle territories was the keel-billed toucan (\"Ramphastos sulfuratus\"), accounting for 11.3% of 408 prey items, followed by the plain chachalaca (\"Ortalis vetula\") (6.5%) and great tinamou (\"Tinamus major\") (4%) (in by far the largest dietary study conducted for this hawk-eagle). In total, birds were 56.3% of the foods for the species at the Tikal study. Another Guatemalan study observed 6 avian prey items and 1 mammal (bat) as prey as a hawk-eagle nest. The next largest known study, in rainforests near Manaus, Brazil, found among 82 prey items, birds made up 63.3% of the diet. The most often identified avian prey here were probable dusky-legged guan (\"Penelope obscura\") (20.4%) and two species of large tinamous (12.24%). At a slightly smaller dietary study of the southern part of the Atlantic forest of Brazil found that 90% of 30 prey items were birds, principally brown tinamou (\"Crypturellus obsoletus\") (33.3%), \"Leptotila\" doves (10%), dusky-legged guan and green-barred woodpecker (\"Colaptes melanochloros\") (both 6.67%). Apparently, birds (including chickens (\"Gallus gallus domesticus\")) were the main foods in Trinidad and Tobago. In a nest in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 14 of 15 prey items were assorted birds. More secondary avian prey recorded for ornate hawk-eagles includes cuckoos, potoos, rails, trumpeters, herons and egrets, vultures, owls, kingfishers, motmots and hoatzins (\"Opisthocomus hoazin\").\n\nHowever, at both Tikal and Manaus, the most often identified prey species types were mammals. In Tikal, the similar Yucatan squirrel (\"Sciurus yucatanensis\") and the Deppe's squirrel (\"Sciurus deppei\") lead the food by number, accounting for 28.2% of the foods. In Manu, unidentified species of large terrestrial rodents, either agoutis or the similar but smaller acouchis took the primary position, making up 24.4% of the diet. At a single nest in Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela, without presented metrics, rodents and mammals were observed to outnumber birds in the diet, namely the red-tailed squirrel (\"Sciurus granatensis\") and cotton rats (\"Sigmodon ssp\".). Among mammals, these medium to fairly large rodents regardless of whether they show terrestrial (agoutis and similar species) or arboreal (tree squirrels) tendencies make up the largest known portion of the food, perhaps most key being partially diurnal habits. Another widely recorded mammalian prey ground are procyonids despite a slight penchant for more nocturnal activity, including such prey as raccoon (\"Procyon lotor\"), white-nosed coati (\"Nasua narica\"), kinkajou (\"Poto flavus\") and cacomistle (\"Bassariscus sumichrasti\"). Usually the hawk-eagles are likely to target juveniles of the larger species of procyonid, although adults at least up to the size of kinkajous may be taken. However, certainly the most well-studied mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagles are New World monkeys, which they do not hunt necessarily seem to hunt preferentially. However, they are unlikely to ignore an opportunity to prey upon primates. Among monkeys, mainly those of a smaller size class are hunted, largely such groups as squirrel monkeys, tamarins, marmosets and titi monkeys are attacked. In most such monkey species, adults usually weigh less than , and juveniles may be slightly more regularly taken even for species this small. Larger primates, i.e. averaging over , are on occasion vulnerable to predation by ornate hawk-eagles including white-faced sakis (\"Pithecia pithecia\"), Guatemalan black howler (\"Alouatta pigra\") (certainly only juveniles of this very large howler monkey) and some species of capuchin monkey. Due to the range of predators that they attract given their relatively smaller size, monkeys in the neotropics are highly wary and have well-developed anti-predator defenses, especially a variety of alarm calls, grouping techniques, great arboreal agility and aggressive defensive attacks by top males, all of which make monkeys more difficult to attack than more solitary, terrestrial and/or slower-moving mammal prey of similar size. Relatively few mammalian prey are taken outside of rodents, procyonids and monkeys, but ornate hawk-eagles are also known to take Jamaican fruit bats (\"Artibeus jamaicensis\"), a few species of opossum, silky anteaters (\"Cyclopes didactylus\") and even apparently bush dogs (\"Speothos venaticus\"). One reported instance of scavenging on carrion has been reported for this hawk-eagle, on the carcass of a domestic cow (\"Bos primigenius taurus\"). Apart from mammals and birds, only rarely does the ornate hawk-eagle seem to hunt reptiles (i.e. lizards and unidentified snakes). While in many dietary studies no reptiles were known to be taken, in the Manaus area of Brazil reptiles made up nearly 4.1% of the diet.\n\nThe size of prey taken can be quite variable for ornate hawk-eagles. In one estimate, most prey (specifically avian types) was estimated to weigh between . In the large study of Tikal, Guatemala, the size of prey items was estimated to weigh from for the Jamaican fruit bat to for the great curassow (\"Crax rubra\"). Another prey item taken of similar size to the fruit bat is the Mexican mouse opossum (\"Marmosa mexicana\") and these two species are the smallest known mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagle. The smallest avian prey recorded thus far is the long-tailed silky-flycatcher (\"Ptilogonys caudatus\"). Otherwise, passerine prey taken are slightly larger, usually various jays and icterids, resulting in persistent mobbing of hawk-eagles by species such as brown jays (\"Psilorhinus morio\") (this loud mobbing of the hawk-eagles in Central America in turn allows researchers to more easily find the raptors). Despite the ornate hawk-eagles’ notable predatory power and ability to take large prey, mean prey sizes taken in a couple of estimates are not exceptional relative to their own body mass, though are perhaps slightly higher than those for most similarly sized raptors. In the Tikal study, mean prey size was estimated at , with avian prey averaging an estimated and mammal prey (which consisted largely of squirrels) averaging an estimated . In the smaller dietary study from the Atlantic forests of Brazil, estimated mean prey size was . Thus mean prey sizes from the two studies averages at about 34-42% of the hawk-eagle's own body size. Within their enclosed forest habitats, ornate hawk-eagle are capable of attacking much of the largest avian prey available, excepting larger birds of prey (the largest regional water birds such as storks rarely enter deep forest habitat). This species is capable of tackling healthy prey weighing up to at least four times its own weight. These include the aforementioned great curassow and the ocellated turkey (\"Meleagris ocellata\"), of which the ornate hawk-eagle is capable of taking adults weighing or more. Mammalian prey taken can reach an estimated in the case of a Central American agouti (\"Dasyprocta punctata\"). Other mammalian prey including the largest procyonids and monkeys hunted by the hawk-eagle can reach similar body masses, i.e. approximately and perhaps even up to around . Of a similar size range to these largest birds and mammals, numerous successful attacks have reported on adults of the green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"), which weigh an average of about . When capturing such large prey, ornate hawk-eagles are incapable of flying with them. In the case of agoutis and curassows killed in Tikal, the hawk-eagles would return repeatedly to feed on their kill, ultimately consuming about half of the bodies before decomposition sets in. A male ornate hawk-eagle that had killed a great tinamou of roughly equal weight to itself (both around ) was similarly grounded after being unable to fly with its kill (only consuming the head before being flushed by researchers).\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle overlaps in distribution with many raptors, including other powerful eagles. Furthermore, there appears to be considerable habitat selection overlap between these species, including both black-and-white hawk-eagle and black hawk-eagle, although the latter is somewhat more adaptable to openings and forest fragmentation. Furthermore, the larger species such as the crested and harpy eagle are largely concurrent in distribution and habitat with the ornate hawk-eagle. While interspecies relations of neotropical eagles are relatively poorly known, it is likely that there is some degree of natural partitioning to allow the raptors to co-exist. To the best knowledge of ornithologists and other researchers, the most likely form of partitioning comes in the form of the dietary preferences. While the three lowland hawk-eagles select broadly similar prey species across their prey spectrum, each focuses primarily on a different prey group. While the largest dietary study from Tikal, Guatemala showed that ornate hawk-eagle somewhat prefers relatively larger class birds, such as cracids. tinamous and toucans, alternately with smallish, primarily diurnal mammals, adjacent studies in Tikal of the black hawk-eagles shows they primarily hunted small, nocturnal mammals such as bats and mouse opossums. Other (but not all) studies also indicate a preference for mammals of varying sizes (perhaps to the size of raccoons) in the diet of black hawk-eagles. Meanwhile, black-and-white hawk-eagles have been indicated to show a preference for slightly smaller birds than those selected by ornate hawk-eagles, such as medium-to-large passerines, pigeons and smallish toucans (such as aracaris and toucanets), though capable of preying on adult ducks and even monkeys quite as large as those taken by the ornate. The most similar hawk-eagle by diet is the closely related black-and-chestnut eagle, as this often hunts gamebirds such as cracids and procyonids like the ornate, but this species has a different altitudinal range being found in forests in the high montane forests, usually at a minimum elevation of .\n\nOther eagle-like forest raptors such as solitary eagles (\"Buteogallus solitarius\"), whose mountainous range (similar to the black-and-chestnut) barely abuts the altitudinal range with ornate hawk-eagle, have strongly different dietary preferences (i.e. snakes) while other \"Buteogallus\" species tend to be much more aquatically based both in diet and habitat preferences. Overlap in the prey spectrum is known with both crested and harpy eagles, but dietary preferences differ considerably. In the harpy eagle, preferred prey are sloths (which have never been known to fall prey to ornate hawk-eagles) and larger sized New World monkeys. Meanwhile, the crested eagle seems to prefer intermediately sized mammals, including monkeys mostly between tamarin and capuchin monkey-sized, but to also seemingly take prey of more varied classes than other lowland forest eagles. In Tikal, like the black hawk-eagle, the crested eagle appears to prefer nocturnal mammals, mostly various opossums, and presumably has a more intensive searching method of hunting rather than the opportunistic hunting typical of the ornate species. In terms of predation on monkeys, a guild of avian predators and a corresponding forest wild cat appear rather neatly partitioned by the size of monkeys being hunted: \"Spizaetus\" eagles as well as other relatively small but powerful raptors and margays (\"Leopardus wiedii\") select the smaller size monkey species, crested eagles and ocelots (\"Leopardus pardalis\") mainly hunt the medium-sized monkeys and harpy eagles and jaguars focus most exclusively on larger sized monkeys. The various forest eagles of the neotropics appear to be surprisingly tolerant of other species, with almost no aggressive interspecies interactions known in the literature. Mostly only vultures seem to provoke a slight aggressive reaction from the parents in nesting ornate hawk-eagles (possibly because some studies indicate that forest-foraging vultures are more commonly egg thieves than those found in more open habitats). Although, in one Guatemalan study the presence of flying black hawk-eagles and swallow-tailed kites (\"Elanoides forficatus\") (which are unlikely to prey on nests) also provoked a defensive whistle by the brooding female ornate hawk-eagle. Indicating a lack of interspecies aggression, one active harpy eagle nest was set with a camera trap captured photographs of a pair of ornate hawk-eagles in a breeding display in the immediate vicinity of the nest, with both species apparently indifferent to each other's presence.\n\nOrnate hawk-eagles, like most but not all raptors, live solitarily or in pairs. Breeding territories are maintained through high circling, either by a solo adult or by a pair. Most displays occur in mid to late morning and are usually at fairly low heights with occasional calling. Sometimes one bird breaks into butterfly-like flight with shallow flutters during display. Other noisy acrobatics are engaged by the male while the female perches, some of which are correlated with courtship. In a mutual display, the pair gliding in tight circles, the male approaching the female from above and behind, as the female rolls to her back and they engage in talon grabbing, occasionally touching. The aerial display of the ornate hawk-eagle can escalate into roller coaster sky-dance involving series of dives at about 45 degrees on half-closed wings interspersed with heavy looking climbs and floppy beats with looping gyrations and occasionally a complete loop. Home range size is variable in different seasons, from and estimated density can vary from one 1 bird per to 13 birds per in parts of Guatemala and French Guiana, respectively. In Tikal, Guatemala, adult birds of both sexes used an average of , occasionally ranging up to at least . Here the mean nearest nest distance was estimated at . In the much sparser population of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, it was estimated that there was one pair per each . In the Petén area of Guatemala there is an estimated nesting density of one pair per . The Tikal studies shows evidence of pairs shifting their territorial boundaries, in some cases this has been apparently and surprisingly due to the intrusion of another ornate hawk-eagle. Per the study: \"Perhaps in these formidably armed bird predators, territory occupants sometimes readjust their patterns of spatial use rather risk outright aggressive contest\".\n\nOrnate hawk-eagles can typically only breed every other year, unless a prior year's nesting attempt fails. Breeding cycles are known to be more prolonged in tropic raptors than in those that dwell in temperate zones. Also tropical species usually have smaller brood sizes. The dichotomy in breeding habits is often most extreme in forest-dwelling tropical raptor species, which in large species tend to have an extremely prolonged post-fledging care stage for young raptors. The breeding season of ornate hawk-eagles normally falls between December and September in Central America, while it is largely in August–January in Brazil. Courtship and nesting behavior were seen in Panama during August to October (later in the year than nearby black hawk-eagles, implying a temporal difference in nesting times for the two species). In Trinidad and Tobago, nest building is around November while in Venezuela was reportedly in March. This species seemingly lays its clutches in the dry season and fledges in the early wet season. In Tikal, Guatemala, the mean egg laying time was mid-March, while in Belize it was similar but slightly earlier in March. In the extensive studies from Tikal, eggs were laid variously anytime from November to May, but 83% were between January and April. Meanwhile, in the Manaus area of Brazil egg laying peaks in August, although copulation has been witnessed as long before than as in June, which may imply a particularly prolonged courtship stage. Copulation typically lasts for 6–12 seconds with 60 copulations recorded in 204 hours of observation.\n\nThis species builds a bulky, large stick nest that is generally typical of an accipitrid. Nests are exclusively located in trees. The nest height is often above the ground. Two nests in Guatemala were about both in trees of a total height of around while, in Belize, the nest height of 3 were from in trees of a total height of . In Tikal, 14 nests were found to be at anywhere from above the ground with an average of and an average total nesting tree height of . Nest heights in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil were between . Tree species are often variable, the most significant factor in the seeming selection of nesting trees is that it is often the tallest tree in the forest stand, emerging above the average canopy height. In Tikal, 6 nests were in Honduran mahogany (\"Swietenia macrophylla\"), 4 were in kapok or ceiba trees (\"Ceiba pentandra\"), two in invasive black olive (\"Olea europaea\") and single nests in various genera such as \"Ficus\", \"Piscidia\", \"Cedrela\", \"Pouteria\" and \"Calophyllum\". Further studies show that ceiba trees are popular elsewhere in the northern part of the range. Nests are placed in relatively exposed branches, often being on the main crutch of the tree or the largest, most bare branch (in comparison, black hawk-eagle nests are more difficult to find since they are typically inside the denser foliage of the canopy). Typical sized nests are about across and about deep. 16 nests in Tikal averaged in diameter and in outer depth. In the Manaus area of Brazil, a single nest was a relatively large in diameter. In Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela one nest was observed to be diameter by deep. One record sized nest in terms of depth apparently reached deep and included sticks of up to diameter.\n\nOrnate hawk-eagles typically lay only a single egg. All nests of the species in the wild are known to contain only a single egg. Single egg clutches are also laid by other \"Spizaetus\" hawk-eagles. However, in captivity, at least one female has been known to lay a two egg clutch. The eggs are mainly white in color sparingly overlaid with brownish or brown-red splotches. In texture, the eggs are not glossy and are somewhat pitted to the touch. In Tikal, the eggs averaged (in a sample of four) and weighed typically about . The two egg clutch recorded in captivity differed in many respects from those of wild Guatemalan hawk-eagles. They were smaller, the first measuring and weighing , the second measuring and weighing . Additionally, instead of being whitish with faint brown or reddish spotting, they were unspotted and bluish-white in color.\n\nPrior to egg-laying, the female may remain in the area of the nest 97.2% of the time while the male was in the vicinity only 30.4% of the time in Tikal. Both prior to egg laying and during incubation, the female of the pair often collects green leaves to line the nest bowl, doing so nearly every day both in Guatemala and the Manaus area of Brazil. The female takes a lion's share of the incubation duties. For example, records from Guatemala and Belize show she incubates about 95-97% of observed hours. In 127 hours in Guatemala, she left her egg unattended only for a period of 9 minutes. Incubation lasted for 43 to 48 days in Tikal while in Belize incubation was for 44 to 46 days. As in most accipitrids, males usually capture prey and bring it to the female throughout incubation. When delivering prey, the male and female may call back and forth for several minutes before exchanging the prey item. Furthermore, in Guatemala, the male would relieve the female for any amount of time from 9 minutes to 68 minutes while the female fed, in Brazil he never approached the nest but in one case attempted to and was aggressively displaced by his larger mate. Prey deliveries are done foot-to-foot, and in Tikal the females would immediately behead each mammal or remove the beak from each bird prey item brought to her. During both incubation and subsequent to hatching, both parents may defend their offspring from potential predators, but especially the female. Vultures seem to provoke an aggressive response in different parts of the range, consisting of the female raising her crest, mantling over her egg and calling loudly. Egg-eating mammals seem to provoke a more active anti-predator defense. In Brazil, red-faced spider monkeys (\"Ateles paniscus\") were seen to be attacked and swooped upon by the female, but in a second encounter during which the monkey troop returned, she remained on the nest. Similar anti-predator behavior was observed in Guatemala, where Geoffroy's spider monkeys (\"Ateles geoffroyi\") were flown at and struck until they left the vicinity. In another Guatemalan encounter, a tayra (\"Eira barbara\"), a large arboreal mustelid, was observed to be scaling a nest tree and was knocked out of the tree by the female hawk-eagle twice, fleeing after the second time this occurred. Studies from Guatemala show that humans also draw the ire of the female ornate hawk-eagle. It was found that while climbing to a tree blind near the nest tree that females regularly struck researchers, often causing lacerations even with protective gear on, and were rated as considerably more aggressive in nest defense than black hawk-eagles and crested eagles. In Oaxaca, Mexico, a researcher was struck instead by the male of an ornate hawk-eagle pair. In the Manaus, perhaps because of a larger regional human population causing more shyness or desensitization to human activities, female ornate hawk-eagles were less aggressive to humans in the nest vicinity and did not respond even to workers using chainsaws within of the nest.\n\nThe hatching date in this species is, of course, dependent on when the eggs are laid. Studies from the Tikal area showed 90% of hatching occurred between February and June, peaking between late April and early May. It is likely that the hatching period here is timed with the peak time for fledging of other bird species for easy prey capture. Hatching was observed at a single nest in Trinidad and Tobago in March. In Manaus, Brazil, hatching occurred in September. In Venezuela, the hatchling eagle was found to measure in length and weigh . The studies from Tikal and Manaus describe details of the nestling development over time. Like most birds, and especially birds of prey, the hatchlings are initially altricial. In this species, the eaglets are still unable to lift their heads at 2–4 days old. By about two weeks of age, the young eaglet can start to stand on its folded leg within the nest. The begging calls will increase at about 3 weeks of age. A case in Guatemala of a 16 day old nestling trying to feed itself and defecate over the nest edge is considered rather early for both behaviors. At 36 days, the young hawk-eagle may begin to peck at carcasses but at 49 days cannot still effectively fed itself, with the first food tearing and eating recorded at between 52 and 54 days of age. At 39 days, the feathers of the wing and the tail begin to overtake the down. By the 8th week, the eaglet should be able to stand, wing flap and play with sticks within the nest. A week later, the young tend to be markedly more independent, largely feeding themselves on the carcasses their parents provide and ranging out of the nest for the first time on branches up to from their nest, often flapping their wings a considerable amount. Fledging may occur at any age from 60 to 93 days. The average age at fledgling was estimated as 77.5 days in Tikal while in Belize it was similarly in the range of 70 to 84 days. At 12 weeks, the full juvenile plumage is attained. Despite the full plumage and powers of flight, the juvenile hawk-eagles continue to linger in the vicinity of the nest, typically venturing no further than from the nest for months. The young eagles often continue to beg loudly for food, especially once their parents are in view, but if their crop is full they often retire to quietly sit in dense foliage. In one case from Brazil, the juvenile eagle was observed to fly up to greet one of its parents and grabbed the prey item without landing before continuing to a nearby perch. In Guatemala, 3 young males were still in away from the nest at 5 months of age. In the same area, 2 females of 9 months age were typically away from the nest while another two young females of the same age were at an average distance from the nest of . At 11–12 months, the juveniles may begin to soar around their parents’ territory. 3 females in Tikal gradually increase their wanderings at 12–14 months old, ranging anywhere from to from the nest. Around a year of age, the juvenile eagles are likely to make their first attempts to hunt prey. The minimum age at which independence appears to be possible for ornate hawk-eagles is around 11.5–12 months. The average age of independence in studies from Tikal was found to 15.4 months of age for 13 banded juveniles. More poorly known is the age of maturity, which has been estimated at only two years, a matter of months after independence and when the hawk-eagles appear to enter their subadult plumage stage. There is little inconvertible evidence that the species begins breeding at any younger than three years of age. At least one case in Tikal was observed of a pair both in subadult plumage that was breeding, however. While breeding success rates are not known for this species this same subadult breeding pair was observed to kill and cannibalize a juvenile from another territory. When a nest was in imminent risk of flooding from the overflow of a nearby reservoir in southern Brazil, a pair of ornate hawk-eagles appeared to accept translocation when researchers relocated an entire nest intact with nestling in tow to nearby tree, at away. In interspecies comparisons, Tikal studies showed that black hawk-eagles are independent slightly faster at around 12 months old but, like the ornate, also reach maturity roughly in the zone of 2 to 3 years of age while crested eagles take 22.7–30 months until independence and start breeding somewhere around 3 to 4 years of age. In many of the larger eagles, including the harpy eagle, whether tropical or temperate zone dwelling, the minimum age of maturity seems to be around 5 years of age and in some large Afro-tropical species, possibly ranges up to more than 7 years of age.\n\nThe ornate hawk-eagle is, like many large birds of prey, probably naturally scarce. However, the species has shown a marked declining trend. Therefore, in 2012, the species was uplisted to Near Threatened. Currently the total population is estimated at between 13,300 and 33,300 individuals, a very small population considering the species’ ample range. Various means of analysis in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil all showed it to be least densely populated of the three species of \"Spizaetus\" in the area. In particular, when compared to the black hawk-eagle, the ornate hawk-eagle is much less tolerant of partial deforestation and human disturbance and is generally rather more scarce. For example, in the fragmented forest of Paranapiacaba, Brazil, the black hawk-eagle was recorded 2.5 times more frequently during surveys than the ornate species. The species is locally extinct in several former parts of the range. It is thought to have gone extinct early due to increased extensive 19th century colonization in Tumbes, Peru as well as the Belém and probably the São Francisco regions of Brazil. More recently, the continued presence of breeding ornate hawk-eagles was considered doubtful or at critical threat level in western Ecuador and local biologists considered the species to be extirpated from Colima, Mexico. Evidence indicates declines are likely occurring in almost every part of the species’ distribution. Biologists working in Southeastern Brazil felt that the species, though still present, should be uplisted to regionally critically endangered. Increases or apparent breeding records of the species in new areas are likely not correlated to actual population increases but are more likely cases of the species being driven from adjacent areas as habitats become unacceptable, accounting for increased records of the species at drier forests (i.e. in Mexico) or in higher elevations (i.e. in Colombia). What were considered possible range expansions in different areas of Brazil, such as the Caatinga (Serra das Confusões National Park) and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as in northwestern Peru, may be more likely mere cases of more extensive bird surveying in previously little studied areas. The ornate hawk eagle has a status of rare but persisting on Panamanian islands, Coiba and Barro Colorado Island.\n\nThe leading cause, by far, for the species decline is epidemic levels of deforestation. The terribly extensive deforestation of several areas of the neotropics, particularly the Amazon rainforest, was the catalyst for the species being uplisted in 2012. Declines are correlated to deforestation in most parts of the species’ range, all the way from the northern limits in Mexico down to the southern limits in Argentina. Even where lands become protected, it is in many cases too late due to forest fragmentation prior to conservation, resulting in stands too fragmented to support extensive use by the ornate hawk-eagles. Canopy coverage of the forest must be at least 80% in order to retain this hawk-eagle, per a study of its habitat ranging in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Beyond deforestation, human hunting is also causing declines of this species. In part this is due to competition for resources. For example, studies in Tikal, Guatemala showed that 49.4% of the biomass at ornate hawk-eagle nests was overlapping with the wild animals most extensively hunted by local humans (i.e. cracids, agoutis, squirrels). Also, where domestic chickens are found, they are opportunistically hunted by ornate hawk-eagle. Due to the causes of wild prey competition and predation of domestic fowl, humans frequently target and shot this and other eagles on sight, even without direct provocation. Little overarching conservation efforts are known to have been implemented specifically pertaining to this species’ declines, beyond the general retention and conservation of existing forests.\n\n\n"}

They include both large (up to 2 meters long) carnivorous and even larger (to 3 meters) herbivorous forms, some semi-aquatic and others fully terrestrial. The Diadectomorpha seem to have evolved during late Mississippian times, although they only became common after the Carboniferous rainforest collapse and flourished during the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian periods.\n\nDiadectomorphs possess both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. Originally these animals were included under the order Cotylosauria, and were considered the most primitive and ancestral lineage of reptiles. More recently they have been reclassified as amphibian-grade tetrapods, closely related to the first true amniotes (though they have also been argued to be amniotes more closely related to synapsids than to sauropsids). Contrary to other Reptiliomorph amphibians, the teeth of the Diadectomorpha lacked the infolding of the dentine and enamel that account for the name Labyrinthodontia for the non-amniote tetrapods.\n\nDiadectomorpha is most commonly given the rank of order when formal taxonomic ranks are applied. It is further divided into three families, representing specialization into different ecological niches. The exact phylogenetic relationship between the three is disputed.\n\n\nThe reproduction of the Diadectomorphs has been the matter of some debate. If their group lay within the Amniota as has at times been assumed, they would have laid an early version of the amniote egg. Current thinking favours the amniote egg being evolved in very small animals, like \"Westlothiana\" or \"Casineria\", leaving the bulky Diadectomorphs just on the amphibian side of the divide.\n\nThis would indicate the large and bulky Diadectomorphs laid anamniote eggs (in water). However, no unambiguously diadectomorph tadpole is known. Whether this is due to an actual lack of tadpole stage or taphonomy (many diadectomorphs were upland creatures where tadpoles would have a poor probability of being fossilized) is uncertain. Alfred Romer indicated that the anamniote/amniote divide might not have been very sharp, leaving the question of the actual mode of reproduction of these large animals unanswered. Possible reproductive modes include full amphibian spawning with aquatic tadpoles, internal fertilization with or without ovoviviparity, aquatic eggs with direct development or some combination of these. The reproductive mode might also have varied within the group.\n\n\n"}

It is found locally north to southern Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, Maryland, western New York, and the extreme south of Ontario, Canada.\n\nMature Shumard oaks typically reach heights of , trunk diameter is typically , and crown width typically reaches in width. Typical size varies according to region, with larger specimens occurring in the southern portions of its native range in the United States. Record Shumard oaks have been measured at up to tall, with crowns up to in width. Young specimens generally exhibit conic or ovate crowns, with the upper crown filling in as the tree reaches maturity. Trunks are relatively straight and vertical. Trunks may have deeply fluted buttresses near the ground. Shumard oak is typically found in lowland areas and is able to survive where the soils experience flooding for six weeks of the year.\n\nThe young bark of the Shumard oak is light grey, very smooth, and very reflective. Shumard oak bark darkens and develops ridges and furrows as it ages. Occasionally, white splotches are seen on the bark.\n\nShumard oak twigs terminate in a cluster of buds. The buds are lighter in color than the olive-green twigs. The young twig is highly reflective.\n\nThe leaves are arranged alternately and are broadly obovate with 5–9 lobes, each of which is terminated by bristle-tipped teeth. The leaves mature to between in length. The surfaces are glabrous, except for the tufted vein axils. They are dark green on the top, while their bottoms are a slightly lighter shade of green. The leaves turn brown to red in the fall and sometimes have hues of yellow mixed in. Fall colors are relatively late; specimens in central Texas may be at their most red in early December, while Florida specimens may not color substantially until February.\n\nShumard oaks bear relatively large acorns, which typically reach up to in diameter. Acorns take between 1.5 and 3.0 years to fully mature and may go unnoticed during their early stages of development.\n\nThe acorns of the Shumard oak provide food for various songbirds, game birds such as wild turkey and quail, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, feral hogs, and various rodents such as squirrels. The leaves and twigs can also provide browse for white-tailed deer.\n\nOak wilt can attack all red oaks, including the Shumard oak. Other diseases that attack Shumard oaks are various fungi that can grow on the leaves, powdery mildew, canker diseases, and shoestring root.\n\nShumard oak is valued for commercial use, as a shade tree, and as a food source for various birds and mammals. It is cultivated at least as far north as Ottawa, Ontario and southern Quebec, and as far south as Lake Worth, Florida. It is tolerant of wide ranges of pH levels in soil. It is drought-resistant, and prefers partial to full sunlight. Shumard oaks begin to bear seeds at a minimum of 25 years of age, and the optimum age for seed development is 50. They are known to have reached at least 480 years of age. The roots are intolerant to disturbance, so the tree should be planted in its permanent position at an early age.\n\nShumard oak lumber is grouped with other red oak lumber for use in flooring, furniture, interior trim, decorative molding, paneling, and cabinetry. The lumber of Shumard oak is considered \"mechanically superior\" to that of other red oaks.\n"}

As a member of the Conservative Party, he governed in the early years of the era to be known as the Thirty Five Years of Conservatism in Nicaragua's political history. \nCuadra's family had roots in Nicaragua since the days of the conquistadors. The Cuadra family's wealth and power came from interests in banking, agriculture, and mining. During most of his lifetime, Vicente Cuadra was one of the richest landowners in the country. \n\nVicente Cuadra was elected by a landslide but was reluctant to serve due to poor health. However, he decided to serve in the best interests of the country after the Congress gave him an overwhelming vote of confidence and a mandate. His presidency was a reflection of his character – ethical, frugal, and visionary. The Cuadra administration instituted a system of checks and balances in the executive branch, re-established the credit worthiness of the country, replenished the treasury, and positioned the war ravaged nation for much needed infrastructure improvements and projects which occurred during his successor's (Pedro Joaquin Chamorro) term. Educational, judicial, and scientific reforms were also implemented. Critics thought Cuadra as stingy and rigid. The biggest failure of his administration was the inability to deal with the Miskito tribal nation in the eastern region of Nicaragua.\n\nVicente Cuadra really didn't enjoy being in the front lines of politics. His brother, \"Jose Joaquin\", was better suited for that. Vicente, himself, preferred working behind the scenes like he did when he helped draft the Constitution of 1858. When his term of office was over, Cuadra retired to spending time with his family, overseeing his businesses, and writing. He didn't get much involved in the politics of the country and would rarely offer \"the opinion of a statesman\" unless it was warranted. The irony is that in 1891, Gen. José Santos Zelaya of the Liberal Party, taking advantage of splits within the Conservative party, began an economic and political campaign to ruin all of the Conservatives in the country, targeting the icons such as Vicente Cuadra. The former president's businesses were wiped out, most of his lands were confiscated, and his writings were burned. The final insult was that the 79-year-old Cuadra was imprisoned for a few weeks.\n\nCuadra is one of the least known of Nicaragua's presidents due to:\nSince 1854, approximately forty individuals have served as the President of Nicaragua. Among a select few, Vicente Cuadra is considered a model president in Nicaragua's presidential history.

His brothers were Dionisio Chamorro Alfaro and Fernando Chamorro Alfaro. Dionisio was married to Mercedes Oreamuno ... and had two sons, Salvador Chamorro Oreamuno and Rosendo Chamorro Oreamuno, President of Nicaragua, the first of whom married Gregoria Vargas Báez and had Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, 55th and 59th President of Nicaragua.

He also contributed to the struggle to expel William Walker, the American filibuster. In 1862 he dedicated himself to politics as Senator of the Department of Granada. In 1869, he became a member of the governing junta of Nicaragua. He was elected president in 1871 for four years, and again joined the ruling junta in 1885. In both his public and private life, Don Pedro was considered progressive by some and an opportunist by many others, when conservative forces would keep \"campesinos\" without access to education. He represented a faction of the Granada oligarchy and maintained strong conservative principles, which in Latin America meant the preservation of a feudal economic system, with an emphasis on trade. His influence would help form Nicaragua as a nation with the limitations of keeping the country and its economic resources under the control of a few families including the Chamorro and the few other families that still control Nicaragua economically today. He remained a political force in Nicaragua until his death on 7 June 1890.\n\n"}

This phenomenon was first discovered by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart (Markus J. Buehler and Huajian Gao) and IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California (Farid F. Abraham).\n\nThe issues of intersonic and supersonic fracture become the frontier of dynamic fracture mechanics. The work of Burridge initiated the exploration for intersonic crack growth (when the crack tip velocity V is between the shear in wave speed C^8 and the longitudinal wave speed C^1.\n\nSupersonic fracture was a phenomenon totally unexplained by the classical theories of fracture. Molecular dynamics simulations by the group around Abraham and Gao have shown the existence of intersonic mode I and supersonic mode II cracks. This motivated a continuum mechanics analysis of supersonic mode III cracks by Yang. Recent progress in the theoretical understanding of hyperelasticity in dynamic fracture has shown that supersonic crack propagation can only be understood by introducing a new length scale, called χ; which governs the process of energy transport near a crack tip. The crack dynamics is completely dominated by material properties inside a zone surrounding the crack tip with characteristic size equal to χ. When the material inside this characteristic zone is stiffened due to hyperelastic properties, cracks propagate faster than the longitudinal wave speed. The research group of Gao has used this concept to simulate the Broberg problem of crack propagation inside a stiff strip embedded in a soft elastic matrix. These simulations confirmed the existence of an energy characteristic length. This study also had implications for dynamic crack propagation in composite materials. If the characteristic size of the composite microstructure is larger than the energy characteristic length, χ; models that homogenize the materials into an effective continuum would be in significant error. The challenge arises of designing experiments and interpretative simulations to verify the energy characteristic length. Confirmation of the concept must be sought in the comparison of experiments on supersonic cracks and the predictions of the simulations and analysis. While much excitement rightly centres on the relatively new activity related to intersonic cracking, an old but interesting possibility remains to be incorporated in the modern work: for an interface between elastically dissimilar materials, crack propagation that is subsonic but exceeds the Rayleigh wave speed has been predicted for at least some combinations of the elastic properties of the two materials.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230786", "title": "Cacops", "text": "Cacops\n\nCacops (\"ugly look\" for its strange appearance), a genus of dissorophid temnospondyls, is one of the most distinctive Paleozoic amphibians that diversified in the equatorial region of Pangea during the Kungurian stage of the early Permian. Dissorophids were a group of fully terrestrial, often heavily armored faunivores. This, along with their relatively large size and geographical range suggest that they were able to coexist with amniotes as predators during the early Permian. Dissorophidae has four distinct clades differentiated largely on the morphology of the osteoderms, the Eucacopinae (previously Cacopinae), the Dissorophinae, the Aspidosaurinae, and the Platyhystricinae. \"Cacops\" is one of the few olsoniforms (dissorophids and the larger trematopids) whose ontogeny is beginning to surface. \"Cacops\" fossils were almost exclusively known from the Cacops Bone Bed of the Lower Permian Arroyo Formation of Texas for much of the 20th century. New material collected from the Dolese Brothers Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma in the past few decades has been recovered, painting a clearer picture of what the animal looked and acted like.\n\n\"Cacops aspidephorus\" is the most famous dissorophid, in part due to a majority of its skeleton having been known for over a century. \nOver 50 specimens have been found in the \"Cacops\" Bone Bed in Baylor County, Texas, which is now flooded by the dammed Lake Kemp. However, many of the specimens are covered in calcite, which penetrates the bone tissue, resulting in poor preservation. \"\"Trematopsis seltini\"\" from the Vale Formation of Texas was originally described as a trematopid by Olson (1956) but was later synonymized with \"Cacops aspidephorus\" by Milner (1985). \n\n\"Cacops morrisi\" is named in honor of Tony Morris, who discovered one of its two specimens. Many specimens have been found in the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. \"Cacops morrisi\" has a skull that differs from \"C. aspidephorus\" in having a snout that is slightly longer than its post-orbital region, a shorter distance between the orbit and the temporal emargination, and uncinate processes of the ribs.\n\n\"Cacops woehri\" is named in honor of Daniel Woehr, who is an amateur collector of fossils. Specimens have been found in the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. \"Cacops woehri\" differs from \"C. aspidephorus\" and \"C. morrisi\" in many attributes, including a more shallow skull, more dorsally located orbits, and a narrow opening of its tympanic embayment. The contribution of the postparietals to the skull roof also appears to be shorter in \"C. woehri\" than in \"C. morrisi,\" while the occipital flanges are proportionately larger in \"C. woehri\". More notable differences distinguishable from \"C. morrisi\" include: absence of lateral exposure of ectopterygoid in juveniles, absence of tusk-like teeth on the anterior margin of the interpterygoid vacuities, and the quadratojugal lacking an anterior process. The teeth of \"C. woehri\" are also not recurved as in \"C. aspidephorus\" and \"C. morrisi\", showing instead a distinct lingual curvature. Because of the different skull shape, it is theorized that this specific taxon may have had a different ecology than its sister taxa, possibly with a different prey spectrum. This suggests that there could have been different functional demands for the dissorophoids found at the Oklahoma locality.\nAmerican paleontologist Samuel W. Williston used the details of the species \"Cacops\" \"aspidephorus\" to first describe its features. He noted: \"The creature as mounted presents an almost absurd appearance, with its large head and pectoral region, absence of neck, and short tail\" (pg. 279), reflected in the name \"Cacops\" (from Greek \"kakos\" \"bad, ugly\" and \"ops\" \"face, look\"). However, because of the poor preservation of specimens collected from the \"Cacops\" Bone Bed in Texas, other researchers who collected specimens from other localities have described many of \"Cacops’\" features with more certainty. Features that distinguish \"Cacops\" from other dissorophids include a large dorsal process of the quadrate and a shortened posterior skull.\n\nThe skull is very box-like and its cheeks aligned almost at a right angle to the skull table. The external cranial ornamentation is noticeable on the skull table and on top of the ridges that border the numerous depressions. One significant ontogenetic change in \"Cacops\" is a more evenly distributed ornamentation in the adults. Like other dissorophids, the temporal region of \"Cacops\"’ skull was dominated by the tympanic embayment, which likely housed a large tympanum. Marginal teeth are recurved and thinner than in other temnospondyls. \"Cacops\" has fewer, but larger, teeth than in most other dissorophids. The palatal dentition consists of recurved tusks larger than the marginal teeth and minute, strongly recurved teeth that cover most of the palatal surface.\n\n\"Cacops\" was a medium-sized dissorophid, being smaller than later dissorophids from Eurasia such as \"Kamacops\". Like other dissorophids, \"Cacops\" had osteoderms associated with the vertebral column. Internal osteoderms are fused to the neural spines, while external osteoderms overlapped adjacent positions with a ventral flange that inserted between successive internal osteoderms. The osteoderms are associated with only the first 15 vertebrae, beginning at the axis. They are relatively narrow, especially posteriorly, and are subrectangular in dorsal profile, except for the first osteoderm which is more triangular. The osteoderms also have dermal pitting on their dorsal surfaces. The distributions of these pits are not random, but rather found along the raised edges of the midsagittal groove and often in the groove as well.\n\nPartial growth series of both \"Cacops morrisi\" and \"Cacops woehri\" are known. Overall changes to the shape of the skull are minimal, indicating that the shallower skull of \"C. woehri\" is a valid feature for differentiating between the taxa throughout ontogeny. Of the two, the ontogeny of \"C. morrisi\" is better known due to more complete material . Ontogenetic changes in \"C. morrisi\" include the development of more rugose ornamentation and more even distribution of ornamentation across the skull, loss of a lateral exposure of the ectopterygoid (the 'LEE'), the posterior closure of the otic embayment, and a flatter posterior skull roof. In \"C. woehri\", there are slight changes to a few elements (e.g., postorbital) and changes in proportions to the parasphenoid. Ornamentation does not change as drastically as in \"C. morrisi\".\n\nThe skull of \"Cacops\" has several features associated with predatory behavior. In particular, transverse flanges on the pterygoid that extend below the level of the marginal tooth row have been interpreted to be adaptive for capturing and holding struggling prey; this feature is also seen in the trematopids. \n\nLike many other terrestrial tetrapods, \"Cacops\" exhibits evidence of a tympanic membrane in the form of a large, smooth, unornamented flange in the otic notch that bears faint striations inferred to have been the sites of attachment. Among modern amniotes, sensory perception requires a specialized middle ear that collects airborne sounds through a tympanic membrane and delivers the vibrations to the inner ear via multiple structures, including the stapes. Thus, the discovery of a slender stapes in \"Cacops aspidephorus\" suggested that \"Cacops\" had an ability to hear airborne sound. The presence of a tympanum in contemporary amniotes is a difference between these terrestrial vertebrates that suggests these two groups had very different abilities to hear airborne sound.\n\nThe locomotion of \"Cacops aspidephorus\" has been explored through two studies by David Dilkes. Two series of osteoderms of the presacral vertebral column affect the biomechanics of the axial skeleton. \"Cacops\" have an internal series, which consist of an osteoderm fused to the distal tips of each neural spine and an external series, which lie dorsal to and between the segments of the internal series. The portions of the vertebral column with osteoderms had limited lateral flexion, thus limiting lateral movement. The authors suggested that \"Cacops\" may have had the ability to move forward in short running spurts or that it may have also used a symmetrical walk similar to modern crocodilians or salamanders, in which its body is supported by opposite movements of the front and hind limbs.\n"}

It is one use of a deed poll.\n\nSome organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without a deed poll. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change in common law.\n\nIn England and Wales, such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the High Court. Deeds so registered are advertised in the \"London Gazette\". A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the Senior Master on behalf of the Master of the Rolls who will take into account the child's best interests. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.\n\nRegistration of deeds is regulated by the \"Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994\", SI 1994/604 (as amended). Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.\n\nRegistration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a witness, carries sufficient legal authority to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.\n\nThe procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.\nIn England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity. In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office. However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a deed poll of change of name () is obtainable from the Central Office of the Four Courts, Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician Seán Loftus, who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.\n\nIn \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\" [1946] Ch 183, Mr Justice Vaisey stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's Christian name if given in a baptismal ceremony – that could be done by only an Act of Parliament. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed \"Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\", the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed\".\n\n"}

Born in Costa Rica to Nicaraguan parents in 1875, he worked as a secretary for the La Luz y Los Angeles Mining Company, an American company chartered in Delaware that owned the large gold mines around Siuna in eastern Nicaragua. In this capacity, he helped channel funds to the revolt against Liberal President José Santos Zelaya, who had incurred the anger of the United States by negotiating with Germany and Japan to resurrect the proposed Nicaragua Canal. Díaz became Vice President of Nicaragua in 1910. After he became president in 1911, Díaz was forced to rely on U.S. Marines to put down a Liberal revolt, which resulted in a contingent of Marines remaining in Nicaragua for over a decade. In return, in 1914, he signed the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty, which granted the United States exclusive rights to build an inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua.\n\nAfter his term as president ended, Díaz briefly lived in the United States. However, he returned to the presidency in 1926, after a coup by General Emiliano Chamorro (following the withdrawal of the Marines) failed to win U.S. support. During his second term as president, another Liberal revolt occurred. The Liberal forces were on the verge of seizing Managua when the U.S. forced the warring parties to accept a power-sharing agreement, the Espino Negro accord. One Liberal commander, Augusto Sandino, rejected the agreement and waged a guerrilla war against the U.S. Marines, who remained in the country to prop up Díaz's government and enforce the Espino Negro accord. In 1928, after elections supervised by the Marines, Díaz was replaced as president by former Liberal General José Maria Moncada. Afterwards, he acquired control of several of Nicaragua's gold mines, which had been destroyed during raids by Sandino's forces. He unsuccessfully tried to restore mining operations for the La Luz Company, until they sold their holdings to the Nevada-based Tonopah Mining Company.\n\nIn 1936, after Anastasio Somoza García seized power, Díaz took up permanent residency in the United States.

In 1910 José Santos Zelaya from the \"Liberal Party\" stepped down from government. In 1925 his continuing opposition to Conservative control of the Nicaraguan government forced him to flee to Costa Rica, where he continued to build support for a return of the Liberals to power.\n\nAfter President Adolfo Díaz was re-elected in 1926, a coup by General Emiliano Chamorro (following the withdrawal of the Marines) failed to win U.S. support, Liberal forces rebelled in an attempt to overthrow Díaz's government. Moncada was one of the leaders, together with Juan Bautista Sacasa and Augusto César Sandino. The United States provided military support for the Díaz government and the Liberal forces were on the verge of seizing Managua when the U.S. forced the warring parties to accept a power-sharing agreement, the Espino Negro accord. Moncada and Sacasa made peace, but Sandino refused and continued the fight and waged a guerrilla war against the U.S. Marines. But in 1928, after elections supervised by the Marines, Díaz was replaced as president by Moncada.\n\nFor many years, conflict brewed between the Liberal and Conservative Parties in Nicaragua. The Liberal Party, which “advocated manhood suffrage, separation of Church and State, and the advancement of the material wealth of the country”, held power between 1893 and 1909 under the control of President José Santos Zelaya. In 1909, the Conservative Party launched a US-supported revolution, with most Americans “aid[ing] the revolutionary party because of Zelaya’s oppressive acts” and a “[desire] to see the concessions cancelled so that they could get in on the lands and make ‘denouncements’ for mining and agricultural purposes’”. Further American intervention led to the deployment of US troops in Nicaragua from 1909-1933, with a brief exception during 1925 that set the stage for the Nicaraguan Civil War.\n\nThe U.S. Marines withdrew their forces from Nicaragua in 1925, prompting General Emiliano Chamorro to rise “in rebellion against a new regime”. He successfully installed himself as president, but the United States refused to recognize his regime. Although Chamorro offered to resign in favor of a designated successor, the U.S. State Department “insisted upon the selection of its favorite, Adolfo Díaz, as provisional president”. Former President Adolfo Díaz assumed the presidency after Chamorro’s resignation, spurring several Liberal leaders, including José María Moncada to rebel. In response, the United States sent troops in 1926 to force an armistice and eventual resolution to the conflict. Emiliano Chamorro and José María Moncada agreed to the armistice, but “the peace talks failed because of the refusal of the Liberals to accept a compromise government”.\n\nIncensed by the collaboration between the Conservative Party’s leadership and the US government, Moncada refused to recognize the new Díaz government. On December 1, 1926, he initiated a new Liberal offensive at Puerto Cabezas. The U.S. responded by “creating six neutral zones along the east coast, [expelling] the Liberal government from Puerto Cabezas, and dumping Liberal munitions into the harbor”. Augusto Sandino, an ally of the Liberal Party, proposed the creation of a revolutionary force that would continue the struggle against the U.S.-Conservative coalition. He was unable to impress José María Moncada, who was “reluctant to turn over precious arms and munitions to [an] unknown guerrilla”. Despite rejection by the Liberal leadership, “the rank and file among the Liberals were more sympathetic” and Sandino would go on to establish a revolutionary force after the compromise between the Liberal and Conservative Parties.\n\nBy 1928, US Secretary of State Henry Stimson had become involved in the conflict. The American public was growing weary of the presence of US Marines in Nicaragua and the US government was looking for ways to quickly withdraw its forces. Given the Liberal Party’s inability to achieve electoral victories under the previous system, Stimson approached Moncada “with a plan designed to permit Liberal success at the polls”. Moncada accepted, telling Stimson that “while there will probably be resistance by small irreconcilable groups and scattered bandits, [he believed] that there will be no organized resistance to our action”. Eleven of the twelve lieutenants under Moncada accepted Stimson’s plan. Only Augusto Sandino and his forces refused. They retreated “into Nicaragua’s rugged northwest” and \"attacked a much smaller group of marines and constabulary at Ocotal\".\n\nDespite this complication, the plan to hold free elections was implemented and the “US Marines supervised the registration and voting procedures”. Nicaraguans were provided the opportunity to vote and, after the Liberal Party’s electoral victory, “José María Moncada was installed as Nicaragua’s president”.\n\nMoncada’s victory surprised many Nicaraguans since his opponent, Adolfo Díaz of the Conservative Party, was a close ally of the US who “owed [it] his entire political career”. His victory, however, had been assured “by the settlement imposed by President Coolidge’s special emissary Henry Stimson to end the brief civil war between Conservatives and Liberals in 1927”. The Liberal Party, which had been denied power through electoral victories, had planned an uprising, “hoping to drag the United States into the fray\". Stimson’s negotiations recognized that the Liberals would not accept anything less than success and, in order to reach a quick result that would allow the US to leave Nicaragua, assisted his victory. Sandino’s violent response to the election of Moncada, however, ensured that US Marines would remain in the country for the foreseeable future since the “1927 Stimson ultimatum had disbanded Nicaragua’s partisan armed forces”. To create a force that could maintain stability in Nicaragua, the United States created the Nicaraguan National Guard and “provided it with arms and training, while at the same time continuing the fight against Sandino’s rebels”.\n\nMoncada asked the US for assistance in stabilizing the country throughout his presidency. The 1929 Stock Market Crash increased President Herbert Hoover’s “desire to remove the remaining US troops from Nicaragua”. Despite President Hoover's reluctance to intervene in Nicaragua, Moncada succeeded in requesting that “the United States supervise Nicaragua’s 1930 non-presidential elections” and securing enough money from President Hoover in 1932 to “chair half the election boards”, thus ensuring that Juan Sacasa, another Liberal politician, would win the 1932 election.\n\nMoncada was the president of the upper chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua 1942-1943.\n\nGeneral, then President Moncada's first marriage was to Ms. Margarita Carranza, their children being Elsa, Aquiles, Elio, Hernaldo, Lesbia and Alba Moncada Carranza. One the latter's grand-daughters, Maria Elena Amador Valerio, married Guillermo F. Pérez-Argüello, the oldest great-grand son of Doña Angélica Balladares de Argüello (1872-1973), who was Pres. Moncada's close friend, comrade and one of his most assiduous political allies in the 1920s and 30s and until his death. It was during his triumphant entrance to Granada, in June of 1927, that the then General Moncada demanded she be accorded the appellation of \"Liberal Heroine\" as a result of what he termed \"her colossal struggles during the Nicaraguan Constitutional War\". From an historical perspective, and as this was reported in various newspapers, most notably in the front page of the Diario Moderno's June 14, 1927 edition, it was thus as of that date, which continued up to her own death at the age of 101, that she, a descendant of the Western Hemisphere's branch of the House of Plantagenet and its most celebrated Nicaraguan female member, became known as the \"1st Lady of Liberalism\" . \n\nFrom his second marriage to Ms. Josefa Reyes Gadea, his children were Leda Maria, Omar and the late Óscar Moncada Reyes, who served as President of the National Assembly of Nicaragua from 1999 until 2001.\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Roberto Sacasa and Ángela Sacasa Cuadra, the former's cousin twice removed. He was a relative of Benjamín Sacasa.\n\nBorn in the town of León, Sacasa studied in the United States from 1889 to 1901, earning an M.D. from Columbia University. He served as a professor and dean of faculty at the National University in León, and was a supporter of the Liberal regime of José Santos Zelaya. In 1924, Sacasa became a member of a political coalition headed by moderate Conservative Carlos Solórzano. Shortly afterwards, the detachment of U.S. Marines which had remained in Nicaragua for thirteen years withdrew, believing that the political situation was stable. In October 1925, Solórzano's government was overthrown by former President General Emiliano Chamorro, who failed to gain U.S. recognition and subsequently resigned in favor of Adolfo Díaz. In the meantime, Sacasa fled to Mexico.\n\nFollowing an uprising by Liberal soldiers in Puerto Cabezas, Sacasa returned to Nicaragua in 1926. Asserting his claim as constitutional president, he established a government in Puerto Cabezas. Supplied by Mexico with arms and munitions, the Liberal rebels, under the command of General José María Moncada, nearly succeeded in capturing Managua. However, the U.S. forced the two warring parties to enter into negotiations, resulting in the Pact of Espino Negro, which required that both sides would disarm and Díaz would be allowed to finish his term. Sacasa reluctantly agreed to accept the agreement and withdraw his claim to the presidency, but refused to sign the pact and left the country; leaving Moncada to sign the pact on Sacasa's behalf. Over the next six years, a formerly obscure Liberal general named Augusto Sandino would lead a guerilla war against the Marines, who had remained in the country to enforce the agreement.\n\nIn 1932, Sacasa was elected President. He took office on January 1, 1933, the day before the scheduled departure of the Marines. At the insistence of the U.S. Ambassador, he named Anastasio Somoza García, who was married to one of his nieces, as director of the \"Guardia Nacional\" (National Guard). The following month, Sacasa met with Sandino, during which Sandino pledged his loyalty to the new government in exchange for amnesty and land for his followers. Sandino continued to call for the disbanding of the National Guard and, in February 1934, he was assassinated under orders from Somoza. Despite Sacasa's disapproval, he proved unable to contain the growing power of Somoza and the National Guard. His popularity continued to diminish as Nicaragua's fragile economy suffered the collapse of coffee prices due to the Great Depression and allegations of widespread fraud surfaced in the 1934 congressional elections. Meanwhile, Somoza's power continued to grow, and he cultivated ties with former presidents Moncada and Chamorro. Early in 1936, Somoza used the National Guard to purge local officials loyal to the president and replace them with his associates. On June 9, he forced Sacasa to resign, appointing a series of puppet presidents before assuming the presidency himself the following year. Afterwards, Sacasa fled into exile in the U.S., living in Los Angeles until his death ten years later.\n\nHe married María Argüello Manning, a cousin of Leonardo Argüello, 66th President of Nicaragua; together, they had the following children: \n\nJuan Bautista Sacaza was the first cousin of Bertha Lacayo Sacaza. Bertha Lacayo Sacasa was married to Lisimaco Lacayo Solorzano and they had only one child Will Lacayo Lacayo. Will Lacayo Lacayo had four children Danilo Lacayo, Bertha Lacayo, Ligia Lacayo and Tania Lacayo.\n"}

Mutations in the \"C9orf72\" gene have been established as a major genetic contribution of FTLD, although defects in the GRN and MAPT genes are also associated with it.\n\nThere are 3 main histological subtypes found at post-mortem:\n\n\nTwo physicians independently categorized the various forms of TDP-43 associated disorders. Both classifications were considered equally valid by the medical community, but the physicians in question have jointly proposed a compromise classification to avoid confusion.\n\n\nDementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) is a rare and controversial entity. New analyses have allowed many cases previously described as DLDH to be reclassified into one of the positively defined subgroups.\n\nThere have been numerous advances in descriptions of genetic causes of FTLD, and the related disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n\nMutations in all of the above genes cause a very small fraction of the FTLD spectrum. Most of the cases are sporadic (no known genetic cause).\n\n\nFor diagnostic purposes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are applied. They measure either atrophy or reductions in glucose utilization. The three clinical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia, are characterized by impairments in specific neural networks. The first subtype with behavioral deficits, frontotemporal dementia, mainly affects a frontomedian network discussed in the context of social cognition. Semantic dementia is mainly related to the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae; brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia affects the whole left frontotemporal network for phonological and syntactical processing.\n\nUnited States Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) was a known sufferer of FTLD, and the illness was the main reason behind his October 4, 2007 announcement of retirement at the end of his term.

In 2001, he participated and was arrested in the Vieques protests, which demanded the departure of the U.S. Navy from that island.\n\nWhen Rangel retired in 2016, Powell ran again for the House seat. He lost to state Senator Adriano Espaillat.\n\nPowell married Andrea Dial, a former \"Ebony\" fashion fair model. They had a son, Adam Clayton Powell V, before divorcing in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhen Powell ran for Congress in 1994, he raised $64,000, 10% of which came from residents of his state, while the remainder were donated by contributors from Miami and New Jersey, including $5000 from Free Cuba PAC, Inc., headed by leading Cuban-exile community figure Jorge Mas Canosa who made a $1000 personal donation to Powell.\n\nPowell spent $1,200 of his campaign funds traveling to Ireland. Powell said he accompanied several lawmakers on the Ireland trip, which was sponsored by the New York American-Irish Legislators Society as a means to raise awareness of the issues that affect the Irish community.\n\nIn 2008, Powell was arrested and charged for allegedly driving while intoxicated (DWI) on the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City. He was acquitted of driving while intoxicated and found guilty of the lesser charge of driving while impaired. This charge is considered a traffic violation rather than a criminal conviction. One juror commented, \"the whole thing is we didn't think he was drunk.\"\n\nPowell lost to Charles Rangel in the 2010 primary for the 15th district.\n\n\n"}

Located at 59th Street and Fourth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, it is served by the N and R trains at all times, as well as some W trains during rush hours.\n\nThe 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 59th Street started on March 15, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on June 22, 1915, as the southernmost station of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926–1927, and again during the 1960s. The 59th Street station is also being renovated between 2018 and 2020, and elevators are being added to make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nThe 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907.\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. The proposal was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ).\n\nConstruction on Route 11B1, the section of the extension between 43rd Street and 61st Street, which includes the 59th Street station, began on March 15, 1913. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915. 59th Street opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island station, which included the segment of the Fourth Avenue Line to the north of the station, as well as the entire Sea Beach Line to the south. The station's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. Since 59th Street was an express station, the platforms were originally long, allowing eight-car express trains to stop there.\n\nOn June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, 59th Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.\n\nIn the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 59th Street, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge–95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968. However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February. The platforms were extended by to the north.\n\nElevator access for this station has been proposed for the late 2010s. However, the installation of elevators has been delayed due to a column replacement project above this section of the Fourth Avenue Line. Both the column replacement and the elevator installation require temporary lane closures on Fourth Avenue, a major artery. An elevator contract was supposed to be awarded in November 2016, but was pushed back to July 2018. A $55.2 million contract for the installation of three elevators at the 59th Street station was awarded in late 2018, and substantial completion is expected in July 2020.\n\nThis station is the southernmost four-track express station on the Fourth Avenue Line with two island platforms. South of the station, there are two diamond crossovers, allowing trains to cross between each pair of local and express tracks. The local tracks continue along Fourth Avenue to Bay Ridge–95th Street while the express tracks turn east and become the BMT Sea Beach Line. The N and R stop here at all times, while some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe station walls have mosaic trim lines on top of the white tiles, and spell 59th Street at intervals. The northern sections of the station are where the platforms were extended in 1970, and they have no mosaic trims or tiles along the wall, instead including an extension of the tunnel benchwall. Two sets of columns run along the entire length of both platforms and are painted yellow. The mosaic trim lines are also present in the mezzanines. At the top of the pairs of staircases to each of the platforms, in the trim lines, there are directional mosaics. Those to the Brooklyn-bound platform say \"UP TOWN TRAINS\", while those to the Manhattan-bound platform say \"DOWN TOWN TRAINS\".\n\nThe street-level entrances are at the southern end of the station, with one entrance along either side of Fourth Avenue between 60th and 61st Streets. This part-time exit is unstaffed and has High Entry-Exit Turnstiles. There are also four exits to Fourth Avenue and 59th Street, with two each to either northern corner, at the north end of the station. Each entrance has its own small mezzanine, and allows for crossovers between platforms.\n\nImmediately south of the station, there are tunnel stub headings running straight from the local tracks. They run for about and would have been for a line to Staten Island via the Staten Island Tunnel under the Narrows, which was aborted by Mayor Hylan before it was completed. There is a \"maintenance of way\" shed that was built on the southbound trackway. The northbound trackway is unobstructed, albeit much darker. The northbound trackway ends on a brick wall, with evidence of a void space beyond. South of this station, the bridge over the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch has four trackways, with the outer tracks occupying the two western ones. The tracks of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line are under the western half of Fourth Avenue at this point so that two additional tracks could be laid in the future if traffic warranted it.\n\nThe original proposal planned a connection from a point between 65th and 67th Streets, just south of the station, running to Arrietta Street near the Tompkinsville station in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. A later plan called for a connection to St. George, Staten Island, near St. George Terminal. Construction for the latter started in 1923, but the project was canceled in 1925.\n\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the largest church in Brooklyn, is located one block east on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets. The Brooklyn Army Terminal is located two blocks west, along with the NYC Ferry pier there, though there is no free transfer between the subway and the ferry.\n"}
{"id": "2230853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230853", "title": "Crag Hill", "text": "Crag Hill\n\nCrag Hill is a mountain in the North Western part of the English Lake District. It was formerly known as Eel Crag; however, the Ordnance Survey now marks Eel Crag as referring to the northern crags of the fell.\nIt is not to be confused with another Crag Hill lying on the border of North Yorkshire.\n\nIt overlooks the valleys of Rannerdale on the west, and Coledale on the east. It is the second highest fell in the area of high ground between the passes of Whinlatter and Newlands, second to Grasmoor. It is 839 m (2,753 feet) high, and has a relative height of 117 m.\n\nThe North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter and Newlands passes, includes Crag Hill.\n\nThe highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east-west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike. Grasmoor has the greatest elevation, but Crag Hill stands at the hub of the range. In plan it appears as a cross with ridges running to the four points of the compass. \n\nTo the north of Crag Hill is the col of Coledale Hause, the high level connection to Hopegill Head, focal point of a parallel but slightly lower ridge. Valleys descend from either side of Coledale Hause, running between these two ridges. Gasgale Gill (or Liza Beck on OS maps) flows westward to the River Cocker, while Coledale Beck runs eastwards to the Derwent. Guarding the way up from the Hause to Crag Hill is Eel Crag, the face which gave the fell its former name.\n\nCrag Hill also has a southern ridge which steps down toward Buttermere over Wandope and Whiteless Pike. The valley of Rannerdale forms the western boundary with Sail Beck on the other side. Both empty into Crummock Water.\n\nThe highest part of Crag Hill is near the 'cross' where the four ridges meet. Moving further east towards Sail, the ridge tapers down with crags on either side. Scott Crags stands over Coledale and Scar Crag (not to be confused with Scar Crags) looks down on Sail Beck. Beneath Scar Crag is Addacomb Hole, a deep corrie without a tarn. By contrast to the west of the summit the slopes are smooth and wide, although still steep.\n\nThe summit areas of Crag Hill are composed of the Ordovician Kirkstile Formation. This is the typical rock of the Skiddaw fells and is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone. Beneath this are the Greywacke sandstone turbidites of the Loweswater Formation. The Causey Pike Fault runs across the southern flanks of the fell, beyond which are the rocks of the Buttermere Formation.\n\nAlthough there is much evidence of mining activity in the surrounding fells, Crag Hill itself has remained untouched.\n\nThe summit bears an Ordnance Survey triangulation column, set on a stony plateau though it has recently collapsed. The view is excellent, although robbed of some foreground by the flat expanse of the top. All of the major fell groups can be seen with the Scafells particularly fine. Although a higher neighbour, Grasmoor detracts little from the view to the west.\n\nFrom the shore of Crummock Water, Rannerdale Beck can be followed to its source, gaining the ridge between Crag Hill and Wandope. The alternative western route follows Gasgale Gill up to its birthplace on Coledale Hause. From Braithwaite near Keswick at the opposite end of the ridge, Coledale Hause is also the first objective. From here a simple ascent turns Eel Crag to the west, although Wainwright listed more interesting alternatives on the eastern side of the crag.\n\nMany ascents of Crag Hill are made indirectly as part of a full traverse of the Grasmoor to Causey Pike ridge. Climbs from Buttermere via Whiteless Pike and Wandope are also practicable. Finally, rounds of either Coledale or Gasgale Gill, crossing to or from Hopegill Head via Coledale Hause, provide fine horseshoe walks for those needing to return to their starting point.\n"}

She may be seen as a just and benevolent deity on the same rank as her husband, or as a grudging old woman holding back her husband's benedictions, which explains why one does not always receive fair retribution for good behavior.\n\nAnother story says that Tudipo is supposed to be a young lady. After Tudigong received a heavenly rank, he gave everything that the people asked for. When one of the gods went down to Earth to do inspections, he saw that Tudigong was distributing blessings unnecessarily. Soon after that, the god went to the Celestial Palace and reported to the Jade Emperor.\n\nAfter the Jade Emperor knew this, he found out that there was a lady that was going to be killed, but she was not guilty. Thus, the Jade Emperor told a god to go down to Earth and bring the lady to heaven. When the lady was brought to the Celestial Palace, the Jade Emperor bestowed her to Tudigong as his wife. She was ordered to look after how many blessings Tudigong distributes and that they not be unnecessarily distributed. This is why many people do not want to pay respect to Tudipo, because they are afraid that she will not let Tudigong give lots of wealth to them.\n\nThe Landlord God () is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk beliefs who is analogous but is not to be confused with Tudigong. The tablet for the Landlord God is typically inscribed with (middle two rows) \"left: The Earth God of Overseas Tang People (overseas Chinese; ), right: The Dragon of Five Sides and Five Lands (; fengshui). The side inscriptions mean \"The wealth comes from ten thousand directions and the business comes from thousands of miles.\" It is believed that the Landlord God has powers to help gather wealth, and the position of the tablet must be placed properly according to the laws of fengshui.\n\nThe Village God has developed from land worship. Before Chenghuangshen (\"City God\") became more prominent in China, land worship had a hierarchy of deities conforming strictly to social structure, in which the emperor, kings, dukes, officials and common people were allowed to worship only the land gods within their command; the highest land deity was the Houtu (\"Queen of the Earth\").\n\nRanked beneath City Gods, the Village Gods have been very popular among villagers as the grassroot deities since the 14th century during the Ming dynasty. Some scholars speculate that this change came because of an imperial edict, because it is reported that the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty was born in a Village God shrine. The image of the Village God is that of a simply clothed, smiling, white-bearded man. His wife, the Grandmother of the Village, looks like a normal old lady.\n\nIn Taiwan, festivals dedicated to Tudigong typically take place on the second day of the second month and the 15th day of the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar.\n\n"}

{"id": "2230861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230861", "title": "The Folksmen", "text": "The Folksmen\n\nThe Folksmen are a fictitious American folk music trio, conceived and performed by actors-comedians-musicians Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. Originally created in 1984 for a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, the Folksmen have subsequently maintained an intermittent public presence for more than twenty-five years. The trio is best known for its depiction in the mockumentary film \"A Mighty Wind\" (2003), but has also made a number of meta-performances on stage and television, often in conjunction with the same creators' fictitious heavy metal band, Spinal Tap.\n\nChristopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer first appeared as the Folksmen on the November 3, 1984, episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". Guest and Shearer had both been regular cast members for some time, while McKean was appearing that night as a special guest. All three had previously worked together on comedy projects involving musical parody, including the \"Lenny and the Squigtones\" LP and a television pilot, \"The TV Show\", which marked the first appearance of Spinal Tap. The \"SNL\" sketch, entitled \"The Folksmen Reunion\", had a similar satirical intent, targeting the renewed interest in American folk music following then-recent reunions of such artists as Peter, Paul & Mary (1978), The Weavers (1980), and The Kingston Trio (1981). Introduced by Pamela Stephenson, the \"SNL\" sketch depicted the Folksmen as caricatures of semi-retired folk musicians: three conservatively dressed middle-aged men, spouting homilies and performing simplistic songs with cloying lyrics. In a 2009 interview, Shearer stated that the songs were intended to satirize \"the fake folk music being written in office buildings in Manhattan’s Upper West Side.\"\n\nGuest, McKean and Shearer made a cameo appearance as the Folksmen in the 1992 film \"The Return of Spinal Tap\", which documented the latter group's real-life reunion concert at Royal Albert Hall in London. When the trio subsequently toured as Spinal Tap during 2001, they would occasionally perform in the guise of the Folksmen as an ostensible \"opening act\"; not all of the audiences appreciated (or even understood) this in-joke, with one appearance in New York City reportedly being booed by a restless audience. Of this twist, Shearer once stated: \"You can think you're in control of the amusing notion of the wrong act opening for a rock band—but when you actually find yourself being the wrong act, it doesn't feel any better.\" In a 2009 interview, Guest reflected further on the phenomenon:\n\nThe line between fiction and reality had previously blurred when, in 1993, Guest, McKean and Shearer performed as The Folksmen at a genuine folk festival held at UCLA in Los Angeles, alongside such real-life folk artists as Arlo Guthrie, Joni Mitchell and Peter, Paul & Mary. According to Guest, the Folksmen went over \"better than the other acts\", while McKean recalled that \"Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul & Mary looked at us and muttered, 'Too close, too close.'\"\n\nThe Folksmen were incorporated into Christopher Guest's mockumentary \"A Mighty Wind\" (2003), which depicted a reunion concert of three fictitious folk music acts, following the death of their mutual manager, Irving Steinbloom. The film included interviews with the band members (which established much of their fictional backstory), reconstructed vintage footage and album covers, and various original songs performed in rehearsal as well as the purported concert, \"An Ode to Irving\". To publicise the film, Guest, McKean and Shearer appeared as the Folksmen on a number of television programs, in which they performed songs and were interviewed in character. Between September and November 2003, the three fictitious folk groups from the film \"reformed\" to undertake a real-life concert tour of cities on the West Coast (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle) and the East Coast (Boston; Philadelphia; New York; and Washington, D.C.).\n\nMore recently, in April 2009, Guest, McKean and Shearer embarked upon the \"Unwigged & Unplugged\" tour to mark the 25th anniversary of the release of the film \"This is Spinal Tap\". This time, they appeared as themselves, performing songs associated with Spinal Tap, the Folksmen and various other film and comedy projects from their long careers. After touring thirty cities in the United States, the trio performed a special \"One Night Only World Tour\" concert at London's Wembley Arena on June 30, 2009, in which they performed (this time in full costume) as both Spinal Tap and the Folksmen.\n\nThe fictional members of the Folksmen are:\n\n\nDuring televised appearances, Barrows/Guest has also been seeing playing the autoharp (on \"Barnyard Symphony\", as performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1984) and penny whistle (on \"Corn Wine\", in a deleted scene from \"A Mighty Wind\"). The studio recording of \"Skeletons of Quinto\", included on the film's soundtrack CD, included guest appearances from prominent musicians David Nichtern (nylon string guitar) and Marston Smith (cello).\n\nCharacteristically, there is some dispute regarding the origins of the Folksmen. It was once claimed that the three members of the group originally met while they were freshmen at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. However, in a 2003 interview, Mark Shubb and Alan Barrows stated that the two had actually met in late 1961 when both were studying at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont. Barrows recalled that \"we were both interested in folk music and there was a big folk music scene, as there were at many colleges.\" They subsequently formed a musical duo known as The Twobadors. As recorded in an official band biography, later issued by Folktown Records, \"In 1961, Vermont's own The Twobadors boarded a bus bound for New York City. Their first stop: Greenwich Village and The Folk Place. Inside, performing on the legendary stage was Jerry Palter\". Palter, who was performing there as a guitarist and backing singer, sang baritone. As Barrows noted, \"Mark was a bass singer and I was a tenor singer, so we had lead—no glue, no middle. We ended up getting together, and it just clicked.\" As their official bio put it, \"Alan and Mark had found their mid-range, and the Folksmen were born\".\n\nThe newly renamed trio soon attracted the attention of folk music impresario Irving Steinbloom (1920–2003), who became their manager and signed them to Folktown Records – as Palter once put it, \"THE label to be on.\" In 1962, the group released the single \"Old Joe's Place\", which became a Top 70 hit and remains their best-known song. According to one source, the Folksmen remained together for 26 months (i.e. two and a half years), during which time they \"played and sang their own brand of 'eclectified folk' music.\" During this time they released no fewer than five studio albums. In a 2003 interview, Barrow recalled: \"We figured that it would be amusing, at least to us, to have one word album titles, and we'd lop off the g's.\" This, however, eventually came to a halt when, as Shubb noted in the same interview: \"We violated our covenant with the audience with a record called \"Saying Something\", which is two mistakes by my account – two words, and two g's. All of our goodwill and tradition and good luck went down the toilet.\" Compounding the problem, that album was released on a lesser subsidiary label, Folktone Records, which, as Palter notes, was \"a decent label – they just didn't have the distribution.\" The album, elsewhere described as \"their one and only experiment in electric\", was not a success, and the trio disbanded soon afterward. Relegated to the status of a minor footnote in the annals of American folk music, the Folksmen would later be characterised as \"the group who were too popular to be purist and too purist to be popular.\"\n\nLittle is known of the activities of the band members after its demise around 1968. In the early 1970s, Alan Barrows began teaching a creative writing course at Swarthmore College near Philadelphia and also taught a yoga class. In 1984, folk music impresario Albert Lilienthal (best known as the man who established the Eighty-eight Cent Hoot at the Seaman's Institute) invited the Folksmen to re-form for a special one-off appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\". At the time, it was noted that this was the first time that they had performed together in almost twenty years. Their appearance prompted a renewed interest in the group's work, and it was subsequently reported that \"they are again becoming a popular late addition to folk festivals within a day’s auto travel of their homes.\"\n\nIn 1992, the trio was scheduled to open for heavy metal band Spinal Tap during the latter's comeback concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. However, there was some concern that the rowdy audience might threaten the safety of the performers, so they did not appear; instead, the Folksmen attempted to recoup their costs by busking, performing a version of \"Kumbaya\" inside South Kensington tube station. It was later reported on Spinal Tap's website that the Folksmen had signed a four-month lease on a 1994 Chrysler minivan in anticipation of Spinal Tap's proposed 1996 Third World Tour, and there were rumours that the Folksmen might put out a CD. However, neither the anticipated tour, nor the album, ever eventuated.\n\nIn June 1993, the Folksmen appeared at the \"Troubadors of Folk\" festival at UCLA in Los Angeles, where they performed on the same bill as Paul Stookey, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Roger McGuinn and others. (Stookey allegedly saw the Folksmen and muttered, \"Too close, too close.\") Eight years later, they returned to UCLA to make a guest appearance at a tribute concert, \"The Harry Smith Project\", dedicated to the late folk music anthologist Harry Everett Smith.\n\nIn 2003, the Folksmen reunited far more prominently for another tribute concert, this time in honour of their former manager, Irving Steinbloom, who died that year. In the days leading up to the concert, the trio met for a reunion barbecue in upstate New York, during which they rehearsed several numbers from their back catalogue including \"Blood on the Coal,\" \"Corn Wine,\" \"Loco Man,\" and \"Skeletons of Quinto.\" At the concert itself, the group originally intended to open with \"Never Did No Wanderin\". Unbeknownst to them, The New Main Street Singers, another Steinbloom-managed group performing that night, end up performing the song. Reluctantly, The Folksmen instead performed only their hit, \"Old Joe's Place,\" and the rarely heard \"Barnyard Symphony.\" \n\nFollowing the memorial concert, which was broadcast live on public television, bass player Mark Shubb came out as a Trans woman, and subsequently performed with the Folksmen in female attire. As she put it:\n\nThis change had the effect of making the Folksmen lineup identical (at least in terms of gender) to that of Peter, Paul, and Mary.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2230873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230873", "title": "Turkish copula", "text": "Turkish copula\n\nThis article covers the use of copulas in the Turkish language. In Turkish, copula are called ek-eylem () or ek-fiil () ('suffix-verb'). Turkish copula are one of the more distinct features of Turkish grammar. Since Turkish is a highly agglutinative language, copulas are rendered as suffixes, albeit with a few exceptions.\n\nZero copula is the rule for third person, as in Hungarian and Russian. That means two nouns, or a noun and an adjective can be juxtaposed to make a sentence without using any copula. Third person plural might be indicated with the use of plural suffix \"-lar/-ler\".\n\nTurkish \"to be\" as regular/auxiliary verb (olmak) and \"to be\" as copula (imek) contrasts.\n\nThe auxiliary verb \"imek\" (\"i-\" is the root) shows its existence only through suffixes to predicates that can be nouns, adjectives or arguably conjugated verb stems, arguably being the only irregular verb in Turkish.\n\nThe missing forms of \"i-\" are supplied by \"ol-\": the infinitive \"olmak\" is an example, since there is no infinitive \"*imek\". An infinitive \"ermek\" appeared in ancient texts; its stem \"er-\" became the current \"i-\".\n\nThe word \"idir\", a variation of \"imek\" indicates alethic modality, so is used for emphasis, or to prevent ambiguity. \"İdir\" is an enclitic word, and exhibits vowel harmony when used as a suffix. Therefore \"Ali asker idir\" turns into \"Ali askerdir\".

It is located on the western side of Tenley Circle in the Tenleytown section of Northwest Washington, D.C., one block south of the Tenleytown-AU Metro station. The school is fully accredited by the American Bar Association, and a member of the AALS.\n\nWCL is ranked 77th in the nation in the \"Best Law Schools\" by \"U.S. News & World Report,\" and has highly ranked specialty programs in Clinical Training (#2), Trial Advocacy (#5), Intellectual Property (#8), Part-Time Law (#8), International Law (#9), and Health Care Law (#15). It was recently ranked by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2019 as 75th in the world for law. \n\nBegun in 1896, it was the first law school to be founded by women, the first with a female dean, and the first to graduate an all-female class.\n\nEllen Spencer Mussey and Emma Gillett began teaching in Mussey's law offices in 1898 after they were approached by three women who wished to study with them. Not originally intending to create a full-fledged law school, they requested the law school of Columbian College to accept the six women for their final year. When Columbian refused the request on the ground that \"women did not have the mentality for law\", the two women became determined to complete the students' education themselves and to found a co-educational law school that was specifically open to women. Although Gillett was a graduate of Howard University School of Law, Washington College of Law only accepted white applicants.\n\nWith its first graduating class, the Washington College of Law became the first law school to be founded by women, the first with a female dean, and the first law school to graduate an all-female class. Mussey's male law clerk enrolled in 1897, making the school officially coeducational.\n\nWashington D.C. incorporated WCL in 1898. After several temporary locations, the school moved to the Le Droit Building on 8th & F Streets in 1900. Enrollment rose to 55 students by 1908 and doubled in five years to 128 students. Dean Mussey secured a lease in 1909 in the Chesley Building on New York Ave, until the school outgrew the six-classroom lease. The school moved to its first permanent home in 1920; the former residence of Robert G. Ingersoll on K Street. Continually growing, WCL moved in 1924 to the former home of Oscar Underwood, and former residence of Archibald Butt. WCL merged with American University in 1949 and graduated its first African American student in 1953.\n\nThe Women & the Law Program was launched in 1948, to promote the integration of women's rights and gender studies into legal education, practice and doctrine.\n\nAfter years of work by Dean Myers, the John Sherman Myers Law School building was constructed on the American University main campus and dedicated in 1963 by Chief Justice Earl Warren. In the same year, U.S. Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) graduated from WCL after ten years of night-study classes, the first time a sitting member of Congress had begun and completed a law degree while serving.\n\nBy 1988, WCL had grown to over 1,000 students. Dean Milstein pushed for a new building, and in 1996 WCL moved less than a mile to The John Sherman Myers and Alvina Reckman Myers Law Center on Massachusetts Avenue in the American University Park section of Northwest Washington, D.C. The building was two and a half times larger than the previous Myers building, and included the new Pence Law Library.\nIn April 2012, the D.C. Zoning Commission approved the plans for American University Washington College of Law to relocate from Spring Valley to American University's Tenley Campus. The approval of plans for further processing and zoning variances for the law school was handed down after American University's full campus plan was approved in March. Construction began in the summer of 2013, with relocation of the law school to the new campus completed in early 2016. Spring 2016 semester classes began at the new campus on January 11, 2016.\n\nWCL's Master of Laws (LL.M.) program ranks 13th nationally in the 2012 AUAP rankings. The Brian Leiter Law School rankings placed the WCL 47th in the 2012 Top 70 Law Faculties in Scholarly Impact. \"National Jurist\" ranked WCL the fifth best law school for Hispanic students in 2008. It ranked WCL the 4th best public interest law school in the nation.\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" ranks WCL 77th in the nation among the 146 ranked schools. WCL's clinical training, international law, intellectual property, and part-time programs are ranked 4th, 6th, 9th, and 7th in the nation respectively.\n\nThe school maintains programs in both human rights and public interest law. WCL's Equal Justice Foundation (EJF) provides scholarships to students who obtain unpaid summer internships with public interest organizations.\n\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at WCL for the 2018-2019 academic year is $81,922. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $293,573. According to \"U.S. News & World Report\", the average indebtedness of 2013 graduates who incurred law school debt was $158,636 (not including undergraduate debt), and 88% of 2013 graduates took on debt.\n\nAccording to WCL's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 56% of the class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation, and 23% were employed in J.D. preferred or professional positions. Five percent of 2018 graduates worked part-time or short term within 9 months of graduation, and 1% are pursuing an additional degree. Thirteen percent of the class of 2018 were seeking employment within 9 months of graduation.\n\nWCL receives over 5,000 applications annually for its full-time program. For the 2017 admissions cycle, WCL received 3890 applications. It enrolled 351 full-time first year students, 62 percent of whom are female.\n\nThe 2017 incoming class had a median undergraduate GPA of 3.42 and a median LSAT of 156 (out of 180).\n\nThere was 41% minority representation in the 2017 entering class with representation from 40 States.\n\nWCL offers the Juris Doctor (J.D.), Master of Laws (LL.M.) in either international or constitutional law, and Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) degrees. The Washington College of Law now offers an online Master of Legal Studies degree.\n\nAdditionally, students can enroll in one of several dual degree programs:\n\nWCL's clinical program is one of the most comprehensive in the nation. The school was one of the first law schools to develop a modern clinical legal education program. With over 200 students participating in the 11 clinics every year, the program is one of the largest in the country.\n\nThe clinic serves a variety of clients including immigrants and refugees, victims/survivors of domestic violence, juveniles, criminal defendants, low-income taxpayers, individuals seeking help with family law, consumer, disability, and intellectual property issues, community groups and nonprofit organizations.\n\nClinics include the General Practice Clinic, Community and Economic Development Law Clinic, Criminal Justice Clinic, DC Law Students in Court Clinic, Disability Rights Law Clinic, Domestic Violence Law Clinic, Janet R. Spragens Federal Tax Clinic, Glushko-Samuelson Intellectual Property Law Clinic, Immigrant Justice Clinic, International Human Rights Law Clinic, and Women and the Law Clinic.\n\nWCL's study abroad program is considered to be among the best in the country, with 30% of the student body studying abroad every year. In 2012, the \"National Jurist\" recognized it as one of the \"most robust study abroad programs out of the 200 U.S. Law Schools.\"\n\nStudents are able to study law for a semester in over 18 countries. WCL also offers summer abroad programs in Chile, Europe (London, Paris, Geneva and The Hague), Turkey, and Israel.\n\nThe Washington College of Law is located on American University's Tenley Campus at 4300 Nebraska Avenue NW. in northwest edge of Washington, DC, approximately 1 mile from the Maryland state line. Construction on the Tenley Campus was completed in early 2016, and includes three primary buildings:\n\n\nThe law school campus is less than a mile from the main American University campus, however a shuttle system is available for students and staff to travel between the two locations. The campus is accessible to students and faculty 24/7 with the use of an AU ID card.\nThe Pence Law Library is , with more than 600,000 volumes, access to multiple databases, 14 group-study rooms and seating for over 600. The library is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to students and faculty with the use of an AU ID card.\n\nThe library collection includes European Community and US government depositories and the Baxter Collection in International Law. Students and faculty also have access to the university's library, the Library of Congress, specialized agency libraries, and other area law libraries electronically.\n\nThe National Jurist placed WCL's Library 41st out of 199 in its Best Law Libraries ranking.\n\n\nWCL participates in several popular study abroad and student exchange programs with universities around the world, including a semester-long program with the School of Law at City University of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2002, the Jessup Moot Court Team was the top ranked team in the United States and third in the World.\n\nWCL offers an online Master of Legal Studies (MLS) that was created for professionals who have law-related responsibilities. The MLS program provides professionals in a variety of industries with an understanding of the U.S. legal system, but it is not meant for students who want to become a practicing attorney. The program offers the following concentration tracks: General MLS, Business, Health Care Compliance, and Technology. Each concentration features fundamental legal training and industry-specific knowledge in order to improve a student’s ability to make informed decisions and legitimize their credibility with clients, co-workers, and partners. The MLS can be completed in as little as 15 months and does not require a GRE/LSAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bryson covers all corners of the island, observing and talking to people from as far afield as Exeter in the West Country to John o' Groats at the north-eastern tip of Scotland's mainland. During this trip he insisted on using only public transport, but failed on two occasions: in Oxfordshire and on the journey to John o' Groats he had to rent a car. He also re-visits Virginia Water where he worked at the Holloway Sanatorium when he first came to Britain in 1973. (He met his future wife while employed at Holloway.)\n\nOn his way, Bryson provides historical information on the places he visits, and expresses amazement at the heritage in Britain, stating that there were 445,000 listed historical buildings, 12,000 medieval churches, of common land, of footpaths and public rights-of-way, 600,000 known sites of archaeological interest and that in his Yorkshire village at that time, there were more 17th century buildings than in the whole of North America.\n\nBryson also pays homage to the humble self-effacing fortitude of British people under trying times, such as the world wars and Great Depression, as well as the various peculiarities of Britain and British English (such as not understanding, on his first arrival, what a counterpane was, and assuming it was something to do with a window. It is a British English word that means quilt.) Bryson also recalls first going into an English tobacconist's and hearing the man in front of him ask for \"Twenty Number 6\", and assuming that everything in Britain was ordered by number. (A popular brand at the time was \"Players No. 6\", and in British English it is usual to ask for 'twenty' (cigarettes), meaning a packet, not twenty of them.)\n\nIn an opinion poll organised for World Book Day in 2003, \"Notes from a Small Island\" was voted by BBC Radio 4 listeners as the book which best represented England.\n\nThe book was adapted for Carlton Television in 1998 and appeared as a six-part 30-minute documentary broadcast on ITV from January to February 1999. The book is also available in audio book format.\n\nHeavily abridged, the book was read in five fifteen-minute episodes by Kerry Shale for BBC Radio 4. It has been repeated on BBC Radio 7 several times.\n\nBryson praises the city of Durham in the book. He later became Chancellor of Durham University from 2005 to 2011.\n\nThe title of Briton Neil Humphreys' book \"Notes from an Even Smaller Island\" (written on his experiences in the former Crown Colony of Singapore) is a reference to Bryson's book, Humphreys stating in 2012, \"When I read Bill Bryson's travel books, I was inspired to do something similar in Asia (some might say rip him off! Luckily, Bill Bryson doesn't say that!)\".\n\n\"Dear Bill Bryson: Footnotes from a Small Island\" (2015) is an irreverent homage to \"Notes from a Small Island\", wherein Ben Aitken retraces Bryson’s journey as precisely as possible – same hotels, same plates of food, same amount of time in the bath – before finishing outside his house on Christmas Eve.\n"}

{"id": "2230911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230911", "title": "Semantic dementia", "text": "Semantic dementia\n\nSemantic dementia (SD), also known as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of semantic memory in both the verbal and non-verbal domains. However, the most common presenting symptoms are in the verbal domain (with loss of word meaning). SD is one of the three canonical clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), with the other two being frontotemporal dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia. SD is a clinically defined syndrome, but is associated with predominantly temporal lobe atrophy (left greater than right) and hence is sometimes called temporal variant FTLD (tvFTLD). SD is one of the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), which results from neurodegenerative disorders such as FTLD or Alzheimer's disease. It is important to note the distinctions between Alzheimer’s Disease and Semantic dementia with regard to types of memory affected. In general, Alzheimer’s Disease is referred to as disorder affecting mainly episodic memory, defined as the memory related to specific, personal events distinct for each individual. Semantic dementia generally affects semantic memory, which refers to long-term memory that deals with common knowledge and facts.3\n\nIt was first described by Arnold Pick in 1904 and in modern times was characterized by Professor Elizabeth Warrington in 1975, but it was not given the name semantic dementia until 1989. The clinical and neuropsychological features, and their association with temporal lobe atrophy were described by Professor John Hodges and colleagues in 1992.\n\nThe defining characteristic of SD is decreased performance on tasks that require semantic memory. This includes difficulty with naming pictures and objects, single word comprehension, categorizing, and knowing uses and features of objects. SD patients also have difficulty with spontaneous speech creation, using words such as \"this\" or \"things\" where more specific and meaningful words can be used. Syntax is spared, and SD patients have the ability to discern syntactic violations and comprehend sentences with minimal lexical demands. SD patients have selectively worse concrete word knowledge and association, but retain knowledge and understanding of abstract words. SD patients are able to retain knowledge of numbers and music, but have more difficulty with concrete concepts with visual associations. Impairments of processing of phonemic structure and prosodic predictability have also been observed.\nThe majority of SD patients have ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43 positive, tau-negative inclusions, although other pathologies have been described more infrequently, namely tau-positive Pick's disease and Alzheimer's pathology. Of all the FTLD syndromes, SD is least likely to run in families and is usually sporadic.\n\nSD patients generally have difficulty generating familiar words or recognizing familiar objects and faces. Clinical signs include fluent aphasia, anomia, impaired comprehension of word meaning, and associative visual agnosia (inability to match semantically related pictures or objects). As the disease progresses, behavioral and personality changes are often seen similar to those seen in frontotemporal dementia.\n\nSD patients perform poorly on tests of semantic knowledge. Published tests include both verbal and non-verbal tasks, \"e.g.\", The Warrington Concrete and Abstract Word Synonym Test, and The Pyramids and Palm Trees task. Testing also reveals deficits in picture naming (e.g. \"dog\" for a picture of a hippopotamus) and decreased category fluency. The question \"What is a Stapler?\" has been used as a primary diagnostic technique for discerning how SD patients understand word meaning.\n\nSpeech of SD patients is marked by word-finding pauses, reduced frequency of content words, semantic paraphasias, circumlocutions, increased ratios of verbs to nouns, increased numbers of adverbs, and multiple repeats.\n\nSD patients sometimes show symptoms of surface dyslexia, a relatively selective impairment in reading low-frequency words with exceptional or atypical spelling-to-sound correspondences.\n\nIt is currently unknown why semantic memory is impaired and semantic knowledge deteriorates in SD patients, though the cause may be due to damage to an amodal semantic system. This theory is supported by the atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, which is believed to contain a component of the semantic system that integrates conceptual information. Others hypothesize that the damage is predominantly to the ventral temporal cortex, since SD patients remember numbers and music, but have trouble associating visual cues to concrete words.\n\nDue to the variety of symptoms dementia patients present, it becomes more difficult to assess semantic memory capability especially with regard to musical elements. In order to circumvent the explicit verbal learning tests for dementia, semantic melodic matching is a useful technique for detecting the semantic memory of semantic dementia patients. Moreover, it is important to maintain that these tests must be compared to nonmusical domain tests, as music cognition is not often measured in semantic dementia patients (less data available).\nStructural and functional MRI imaging show a characteristic pattern of atrophy in the temporal lobes (predominantly on the left), with inferior greater than superior involvement and anterior temporal lobe atrophy greater than posterior. This distinguishes it from Alzheimer's disease. Meta-analyses on MRI and FDG-PET studies confirmed these findings by identifying alterations in the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae as the hotspots of disease - brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition. Based on these imaging methods, semantic dementia can be regionally dissociated from the other subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive nonfluent aphasia.\n\nSelective hypometabolism of glucose has been observed in the anterior temporal lobe, as well as the medial temporal lobe and limbic areas.\n\nDamage to white matter tracts connecting the anterior temporal cortex to the inferior longitudinal, arcuate, and uncinate fasciculi, which are regions of the language network, is also seen using diffusion tensor imaging. Imaging also shows the integrity of the axonal connections from the anterior temporal cortex to frontal and posterior associative areas to be altered.\n\nFunctional abnormalities have also been observed in hippocampal structures, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the cingulate cortex.\n\nMelodies are a key aspect of musical objects that are thought to form the contents of semantic memory for music. Melodies are defined as familiar tunes that become associated with musical or extra musical meaning. Using familiar songs, such as Christmas carols, were used to test whether SD patients were able to recognize the tones and melodies of the songs if the patients were just given the words of the song. In the analysis of semantic memory using melodies as stimuli, the contents of semantic memory can include many other aspects aside from recognition of the melody, such as the general information about the music (composer, genre, year of release). Results have shown that musicians who suffer from semantic dementia are able to identify and recognize certain melodic tones.\n\nFurther exploring the tests of music and semantic memory, results of a study that centered on the comprehension of emotion in music indicated that Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients retained the ability to discern emotions from a song while non-AD degenerative disease patients, such as those with semantic dementia (SD), show impaired comprehension of these emotions. Moreover, several dementia patients, all with varied musical experience and knowledge, all demonstrated an understanding of the fundamental governing rules of western music. Essentially, it was found that superordinate knowledge of music, such as the rules of composition, may be more robust than knowledge of specific music.\n\nRegarding the neurobiological correlates for this study, it was determined, via lesion studies, that bilateral (but especially the left-side of the brain) fronto-temporoparietal areas are significant in the associative processing of melodies. Based on the data of imaging studies that looked at the localization of processing melodies, it can be inferred that the anatomical location of the processes in consistent with the findings that some SD patients have intact melody recognition. Additionally, the neurobiological basis for musical emotion identification implicated the limbic and paralimbic structures in this process. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that the neurobiological basis of musical semantic memory is bilaterally located in the cerebral hemispheres, likely around the fronto-temporal areas of the brain. Unfortunately, due to the lack of studies studying musical semantic memory, conclusions cannot be more specific.\n\nThere is currently no known curative treatment for SD. The average duration of illness is 8–10 years, and its progression cannot be slowed. Progression of SD can lead to behavioral and social difficulties, thus supportive care is essential for improving quality of life in SD patients as they grow more incomprehensible.Continuous practice in lexical learning has been shown to improve semantic memory in SD patients.No preventative measures for SD are recognized.\n\n\n"}

This allows the youth to become an Ultraman against countless enemies while keeping his identity a secret from his fellow members. Almost in the middle of the series, both Hikari and Joneus lost their lives from fighting the Spirit Parasite.

The Heller Empire was led by Heller, who was banished due to his misuse of the Ultra Mind for immortality. The Science Guard were given the Ultria, an ancient battleship made by the Ultra People to counter invasion attempts made by the Heller Army. In the four final episodes, Heller sent a full-scale invasion on Earth to wipe humanity after fearing that they would cooperate with the remaining Ultra People. The Science Guard disobeyed the Earth Self Defense Army to go into space, joining forces with the remaining U40 resistances to form the U Fleet and attacked the Titan Base on Saturn to prevent more invasion forces from coming to Earth. On U40, the Science Guard made a risky attempt to sneak into the Heller City to weaken its defense as the U Fleet attacked Heller's forces in the planet's outer atmosphere. When the Science Guard were about to be killed by Mac Datar, Hikari's secret was exposed to save his comrades before joining the remaining seven Ultras in foiling Heller's attempts to escape. With Amia and the Great Sage being rescued, Heller died in the ensuing explosion as U40 celebrated their victory. Joneus finally separated from Hikari and spent several months to observe Earth with his sister Amia.

In fact, he shot the officer to protect a defenseless mother and child whom the officer was about to murder in cold blood during a 1969 police raid. Unbeknownst to Bird, the raid had been merely a pretext for the police to attack the members of a militant black nationalist organization.\n\nThis incident in the character's background was inspired by the 1969 death of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, who was shot and killed during a raid upon his residence conducted by Chicago police and other law enforcement personnel. On the show, the street on which the raid involving Bird had occurred was identified as \"Hampton Street\".\n\nWhen Bird is released, he starts working as a private detective, hired by the lawyer who had helped free him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the most popular traditional black tea brand sold in the UK. In 1886 Charles Edward Taylor Founded CE Taylor & Co., later shortened to \"Taylors\", the company was purchased by 'Betty's Tea Rooms' which today forms Bettys & Taylors Group. Taylors of Harrogate is still based in Harrogate, Yorkshire, in the first 'Betty's' tea room. The group is still owned by the family of Bettys' founder, Fredrick Belmont and is currently chaired by Lesley Wild. The company is one of the few remaining family tea and coffee merchants in the country, whilst competing with the British-owned PG Tips (Unilever) and Tetley (Tata), where Yorkshire Tea is now the most purchased tea brand in the UK, overtaking Twinings (Associated British Foods) and Typhoo.\n\nYorkshire Tea uses varieties of tea grown in Assam, Sri Lanka, and Kenya, blended to form four varieties:\n\n\nThe Yorkshire Tea brand is being extended to include a range of cakes, biscuits, and fruit loaves, sold as being complementary to drinking tea by its parent company The Bettys & Taylors Group, which owns cookery schools and tea rooms.\n\nCharles Edward Taylor and his brother created their company, CE Taylor & Co., in 1886 which was later shortened to \"Taylor's\". The brothers later opened \"Tea Kiosks\" in the Yorkshire towns of Harrogate and Ilkley, and in 1962, local tea room competitor 'Betty's' took over 'Taylor's', renamed it 'Taylors of Harrogate' and formed the Bettys & Taylors Group, which is still owned by the family of Fredrick Belmont, who founded 'Bettys Tea Rooms'. The Group now uses the 'Bettys' and 'Taylors' brands in a number of industries including Yorkshire Tea and Taylors Coffee Merchants under the 'Taylors of Harrogate' name and Bettys Tea Rooms, Bettys Cookery School and Bettys Confectionery under the 'Bettys' brand.\n\nYorkshire Tea as a brand was launched in 1977, originally conceived as 'Yorkshire Tea for Yorkshire people, and Yorkshire water-types'. In the early days different blends were created and sold for different regions of Yorkshire where the hardness / softness of the water varied. Over time, and as the scale of the brand grew to be fully national, the product has evolved to one single blend in the standard orange-coloured pack. However, it retains a hard water variant in green-coloured packs to cater for those who live in hard water areas of the UK.\n\nWhen Safeway was taken over by West Yorkshire-based Morrisons in 2004, commentators in the London press noted the amount of shelf space in one former Safeway store that was suddenly given over to Yorkshire Tea.\n\nIn 2009, the Prince of Wales granted Yorkshire Tea a Royal Warrant.\n\nUntil 2011, Taylor's of Harrogate supplied the tea free to branches of the WI (Women's Institute). The company has also sponsored ITV1's Yorkshire-based \"Heartbeat\" from 1998 to 2001.\n\nBy 2015, Yorkshire Tea was the third best-selling tea brand in Britain behind Tetley and PG Tips. By September 2017, it was the second best-selling brand behind PG Tips after having overtaken Tetley on sales in the traditional \"black tea\" market. In November 2019, it was revealed that Yorkshire Tea was now the number one selling brand of tea in the United Kingdom with 28% of the traditional black tea market.\n\nIn 2007, a new TV campaign was created using the line \"Try It, You'll See\", voiced by Bill Nighy.\n\nYorkshire Gold is mentioned in the popular Showtime TV series \"Homeland\" as a favourite of protagonist Sergeant Nicholas Brody. Ian Brabbin, tea buyer at Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate said: We were both surprised and delighted to discover that Yorkshire Gold has been given such a starring role in \"Homeland\" and are looking forward to seeing the show when it arrives on our screens here later in the year. We are no strangers to the small screen – Yorkshire Tea has also made a cameo appearance on \"Friends\", not to mention our ever growing band of celebrity fans such as Noel Gallagher and Alan Carr.\n\nAlso on the celebrity fan list are Russell Crowe, who posted on Twitter about the beverage in 2012, and who visited Yorkshire Teas' headquarters in Harrogate whilst touring with his band. Other aficionados include Martha Reeves, who was also featured on the social media site holding Yorkshire Tea paraphernalia, and Patrick Stewart who indicated Yorkshire Gold was his favourite tea during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session.\n\nYorkshire Tea is notable for its packaging which features romanticised Yorkshire Dales landscapes, although from time to time it explores other themes. As an official supporter of the Grand Départ of the 2014 Tour de France in Yorkshire, Yorkshire Tea produced a 30g special edition sample pack rebranded as Yorkshire Thé. As well as the name change, the orange on the usual box was replaced with yellow. On the hard water variety of the special edition Yorkshire Thé packaging the band remained green.\n\nIn 2016 Yorkshire Tea was made available inside a promotional tea caddy linked to a tree planting campaign with artwork featuring characters from the children's book \"The Gruffalo\" and branded \"Yorkshire Tree\".\n\nYorkshire Tea is repeatedly advertised by the YouTuber \"The Spiffing Brit\", allegedly without any official connection to or contract with the Bettys & Taylors Group.

PNFA has an insidious onset of language deficits over time as opposed to other stroke-based aphasias, which occur acutely following trauma to the brain. The specific degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes in PNFA creates hallmark language deficits differentiating this disorder from other Alzheimer-type disorders by the initial absence of other cognitive and memory deficits. This disorder commonly has a primary effect on the left hemisphere, causing the symptomatic display of expressive language deficits (production difficulties) and sometimes may disrupt receptive abilities in comprehending grammatically complex language.\n\nThe main clinical features are signature language progressive difficulties with speech production. There can be problems in different parts of the speech production system, hence patients can present with articulatory breakdown, phonemic breakdown (difficulties with sounds) and other problems. However, it is rare for patients to have just one of these problems and most people will present with more than one problem. Features include:\n\n\nAs the disease develops, speech quantity decreases and many patients become mute.\n\nCognitive domains other than language are rarely affected early on. However, as the disease progresses, other domains can be affected. Problems with writing, reading, and speech comprehension can occur, as can behavioural features similar to frontotemporal dementia.\n\nImaging studies have shown differing results which probably represents the heterogeneity of language problems than can occur in PNFA. However, classically atrophy of left perisylvian areas is seen.\nComprehensive meta-analyses on MRI and FDG-PET studies identified alterations in the whole left frontotemporal network for phonological and syntactical processing as the most consistent finding. Based on these imaging methods, progressive nonfluent aphasia can be regionally dissociated from the other subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia.\nSome confusion exists in the terminology used by different neurologists. Mesulam's original description in 1982 of progressive language problems caused by neurodegenerative disease (which he called primary progressive aphasia (PPA) included patients with progressive nonfluent (aphasia, semantic dementia, and logopenic progressive aphasia.\n\nNo cure or treatment for this condition has been found. Supportive management is helpful.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230954", "title": "Shark repellent", "text": "Shark repellent\n\nA shark repellent is any method of driving sharks away from an area. Shark repellents are a category of animal repellents. Shark repellent technologies include magnetic shark repellent, electropositive shark repellents, electrical repellents, and semiochemicals. Shark repellents can be used to protect people from sharks by driving the sharks away from areas where they are likely to kill human beings. In other applications, they can be used to keep sharks away from areas they may be a danger to themselves due to human activity. In this case, the shark repellent serves as a shark conservation method. There are some naturally-occurring shark repellents; modern artificial shark repellents date to at least the 1940s, with the United States Navy using them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II.\n\nIt has traditionally been believed that sharks are repelled by the smell of a dead shark; however, modern research has had mixed results.\n\nThe \"Pardachirus marmoratus\" fish (finless sole, Red Sea Moses sole) repels sharks through its secretions. The best-understood factor is pardaxin, acting as an irritant to the sharks' gills, but other chemicals have been identified as contributing to the repellent effect.\n\nIn 2017, the US Navy announced that it was developing a synthetic analog of hagfish slime with potential application as a shark repellent.\n\nSome of the earliest research on shark repellents took place during the Second World War when military services sought to minimize the risk to stranded aviators and sailors in the water. Research has continued to the present, with notable researchers including Americans Eugenie Clark, and later Samuel H. Gruber, who has conducted tests at the Bimini Sharklab in Bimini, and the Japanese scientist Kazuo Tachibana.\n\nInitial work, which was based on historical research and studies at the time, focused on using the odor of another dead shark. Efforts were made to isolate the active components in dead shark bodies that repelled other sharks. Eventually, it was determined that certain copper compounds like copper acetate, in combination with other ingredients, could mimic a dead shark and drive live sharks away from human beings in the water. Building on this work, Stewart Springer and others patented a \"shark repellent\" consisting of a combination of copper acetate and a dark-colored dye to obscure the user.\nThis shark repellent, known as \"Shark Chaser,\" was long supplied to sailors and aviators of the United States Navy, initially packaged in cake form using a water-soluble wax binder and rigged to life vests. The Navy employed Shark Chaser extensively between 1943 and 1973. It is believed that the composition does repel sharks in some situations, but not in all, with about a 70% effectiveness rating.\n\nOn the other hand, Albert Tester questioned the idea that dead shark bodies or chemicals based on them could work as shark repellent. In 1959, he prepared and tested extracts of decaying shark flesh on tiger sharks in Hawaii and blacktip sharks at Enewetak Atoll. Tester found that not only did the dead shark extracts fail to repel any sharks, but several sharks had a \"weak or strong attraction\" to them. Tester reported a similar failure to repel sharks by a 1959 test at Enewetak of \"an alleged shark repellent, supplied by a fisherman, which contained extract of decayed shark flesh as the principal component.\" Research has continued into the 2000s on using extracts from dead sharks or synthesizing such chemicals.\n\nSince the 1970s, there have been studies of how the Moses sole repels sharks, with Clark and Gruber both studying it. it has not found practical use, however, as the chemicals are perishable, and the repellent had to be injected into the shark's mouth to be effective; in nature the substance is secreted on the skin and is thus ingested by sharks when they bite the sole.\n\nSince the 1980s, there is evidence that surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate can act as a shark repellent at concentrations on the order of 100 parts per million. However, this does not meet the desired \"cloud\" deterrence level of 0.1 parts per million.\n\nThere have been validated field tests and studies to confirm the effectiveness of semiochemicals as a shark repellent. From 2005-2010, an extensive study on the effectiveness of semiochemicals as a shark repellent was conducted by scientists from SharkDefense Technologies and Seton Hall University. The study's results were published in the scientific journal \"Ocean & Coastal Management\" in 2013. The study concluded that the existence of a putative chemical shark repellent has been confirmed.\n\nAs of 2014, SharkDefense partnered with SharkTec LLC to manufacture the semiochemical in a canister as a shark repellent for consumers called Anti-Shark 100.\n\nRecently, SharkDefense used the same semiochemicals found in SharkTec's product to reduce shark by-catch by 71% in a government grant initiative. The government agency NOAA released these findings in a report to Congress.\n\nIn a 2015 a \"MythBusters\" episode, the hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman used an extract of dead sharks, and were able to drive away 10-20 Caribbean reef sharks and nurse sharks in only a few seconds on two separate occasions. The repellent used consisted of extracts from other species of shark bodies, and sharks did not return for over 5 minutes on both occasions.\n\nThe 1947 Robb White book \"Secret Sea\" mentions a copper acetate shark repellent developed by the U.S. Navy.\n"}
{"id": "2230959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230959", "title": "Charlie Pace", "text": "Charlie Pace\n\nCharlie Pace is a fictional character on ABC's \"Lost\", a television series chronicling the lives of plane crash survivors on a mysterious tropical island. Played by Dominic Monaghan, Charlie was a regular character in the first three seasons, and continued to make occasional appearances until the final season.\n\nCharlie is introduced as one of the main characters in the pilot episode. Flashbacks from the series show that prior to the plane crash, Charlie was a member of a rock band named Drive Shaft. Initially, Charlie battles with an addiction to heroin. He ultimately achieves sobriety, while establishing a romantic relationship with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and acting as a father figure to Claire's son Aaron. In addition, Charlie also develops close friendships with Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick).\n\nIn season three of the show, Charlie begins to face his inevitable death when fellow castaway Desmond repeatedly foresees Charlie's demise. In the season three finale \"Through the Looking Glass\", Charlie drowns at the hands of Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff), sacrificing himself in an effort to save the other survivors. Due to \"Lost's\" non-linear presentation of events and supernatural elements, Charlie makes several appearances in seasons four and six of the series. Charlie is prominent in the series finale, \"The End\".\n\nCharlie was born in 1979 to Simon and Megan Pace, and lived in Manchester, England. When Charlie was young, he was given a piano as a gift on Christmas Day, thus beginning his career in music. Charlie honed his musical talents by playing on the street for money, where he spotted a woman being mugged and saved her, prompting her to call him a hero.\n\nSometime later, Charlie and his brother Liam (Neil Hopkins) had formed a band called Drive Shaft, and landed a record deal. Suddenly, Drive Shaft became extremely popular for their song \"You All Everybody\", although they were a one-hit wonder. Liam, amidst their popularity and success, develops a drug habit and begins to neglect the band. On Christmas Day, while touring Finland, Liam gave Charlie a family heirloom (a ring inscribed with the initials D.S. in reference to Dexter Stratton, Charlie and Liam's great-grandfather, of whom the band was named after), saying because of his addiction he would never have a family so it should go to Charlie. Eventually, though, Charlie became addicted to heroin. As the band's fame began to decrease, Charlie sank further into his addiction. Liam sold his piano so he could enroll into rehabilitation after dropping his newborn daughter. Liam left Charlie alone, in order to be with his wife, Karen, and daughter, Megan (named after the brothers' mother).\n\nWith Drive Shaft disbanded, Charlie resorted to theft in support of his heroin addiction. He charmed a wealthy woman, Lucy, in order to rob her, but she learned of his intentions and left him as he began to develop real feelings for her. Charlie then traveled to Australia to persuade a now-sober Liam to rejoin the band for a comeback tour. Liam refused, offering instead to help him enter a rehabilitation program, but Charlie angrily rebuked him and left to board a plane to Los Angeles scheduled for the next day. The night before the flight, he took heroin with a woman named Lily, who he fought with over the last of his stash until she left angrily. On the plane, he struggles without any heroin and goes to the bathroom to take some, when the plane begins to crash.\n\nOn the second day on the island, he, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) venture inland to the plane's cockpit, where he retrieves his stash of heroin. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) later discovers his addiction to heroin and in exchange for his guitar, Charlie gives up the drugs. After Jack is trapped in a cave-in, Charlie saves him. Afterwards, Charlie burns his drugs in a fire. When Charlie tries to stop Claire from going back to the beach, both are kidnapped by Ethan Rom (William Mapother). Pursuing him, Jack and Kate find Charlie hung from a tree almost dead. When Claire returns and Ethan comes to recapture her, Charlie kills the latter with a gun.\n\nWhen Claire goes into labour, Charlie, along with Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), helps Kate deliver the baby. When Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) abducts the baby, named Aaron, Charlie and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to rescue him. Along the way, Charlie and Sayid stop by a Beechcraft carrying several Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin. That night, Charlie and Sayid manage to reclaim Aaron, and bring him safely back to Claire.\n\nIn Season 2, Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) reveals to Claire the contents of the Virgin Mary statue, creating a rift between her and Charlie. Charlie takes Eko to the Beechcraft where he found them, and the two decide to burn the plane and its contents. However, Charlie secretly keeps a stash hidden in the jungle. Later, he begins experiencing surreal dreams, in which Aaron is in peril. He seeks out Eko, who says Aaron may need to be baptized. Subsequently, Charlie kidnaps Aaron and attempts to baptize him. When caught, Locke violently beats him. As retribution for Locke embarrassing him, Charlie aids James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway) in conning Jack and Locke out of the Hatch's guns and heroin by assaulting Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim).\n\nLater, Sayid tells Charlie about a prisoner in the Hatch, \"Henry Gale\" (Michael Emerson). They, along with Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), attempt to find the balloon Henry allegedly crashed in. When the three return to the Hatch, they reveal Henry to be an impostor. After this, Charlie begins helping Eko build a church, but is angered when Eko abandons its construction. He finds a box of vaccine, and gives it to Claire for herself and Aaron, beginning to renew their friendship. In Sawyer's tent, Charlie discovers the remaining Virgin Mary statues, and throws them in the ocean. Eko seeks his help in finding the dynamite from the Black Rock ship. Charlie brings him to it, and he and Eko go to the Hatch, with Eko intending to blow open the blast door. After an explosion, Charlie barely escapes the Hatch as it implodes. After the Hatch's implosion, Charlie helps Locke standing guard while Locke communes with the island and helping him rescue Eko from a polar bear's cave. After Eko's death, Desmond starts having visions in which Charlie dies.\n\nLater, Charlie joins Desmond, Hurley and Jin on a hike into the jungle where they find a parachutist named Naomi Dorrit, who crashed on the island. When Jack announces his plan to foil the Others and contact the outside world, Charlie volunteers to swim down to the and switch off a device blocking transmissions to and from the island. Desmond accompanies him. He confronts three people, two women who maintain the station and Mikhail. During a confrontation, Mikhail is shot in the chest with a spear gun. Just as Charlie is able to make contact with Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger) in an adjacent communication room, a mysteriously resurrected Mikhail uses a grenade to destroy the room's porthole, flooding the communication room. To spare Desmond, Charlie locks the door from the inside, and warns him of Naomi's deception by writing on his hand 'Not Penny's Boat'. Charlie then drowns.\n\nAfter leaving the island, Hurley has visions of Charlie first at a convenience store, and then later at the asylum Hurley has been committed to. Charlie tells Hurley the people remaining on the island need him, and that he has to return, but disappears when Hurley closes his eyes. In \"Something Nice Back Home\", Hurley conveys to Jack a message from Charlie: \"You're not supposed to raise him\" (referring to Aaron, whom Kate and Jack have adopted). Hurley also tells Jack that, according to Charlie, Jack will also be visited.\n\nIn the episode \"LA X\", Charlie is seen on board Oceanic 815, in the restroom with heroin, as seen in the \"Pilot\" episode. However; during this \"flash-sideways\", flight 815 does not crash, and Charlie gets a small bag of heroin lodged in his throat, rendering him unconscious. He is revived by Jack and later arrested for possession of illegal drugs. He later claims, while he was unconscious, he had a vision of a \"beautiful, rapturous\" woman who is implied to be Claire. Glaring at Jack as he is restrained, he snarls \"I was meant to die.\" In the episode \"Recon\", Charlie's brother, Liam, was at a police station, the same one Sawyer and Miles work at, asking about Charlie. In the episode \"Happily Ever After\" Charlie is released from jail and greeted by Desmond Hume. Desmond has been tasked by his boss, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), with bringing Charlie and his band Drive Shaft to play with Charles' son, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), at a charity concert. Desmond does not succeed since Charlie runs Desmond's car into the water, which triggers Desmond's memory of Charlie's death in the original timeline. Desmond escapes and rescues Charlie from the submerged vehicle. In the episode \"The End\", Charlie is tranquilized by Hurley in order to carry him to the concert which he was scheduled to perform. While on stage, he sees Claire sitting in the crowd and realizes she's the one he saw when he almost died. She seems to be flattered by his attention, but then has contractions and goes backstage with Kate. Charlie follows them and while he gets water and blankets, Claire gives birth and remembers her life on the island. Charlie returns and she recognizes him. She takes his hand and he then remembers everything too, and they have an emotional reunion. They are seen in the church along with the other main characters at the series' conclusion.\n\nAfter appearing in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part which had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rock musician who had been a big hit in the 1980s but had succumbed to heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition for the character Sawyer, they rewrote the part to make him a younger one-hit wonder musician.\n\nLynnette Porter, David Lavery, authors of \"Lost's Buried Treasures: The Unofficial Guide to Everything Lost Fans Need to Know\", saw Charlie as a combination of Harold Emery Lauder and Larry Underwood, two characters from the Stephen King novel \"The Stand\": Both were one-hit wonder guitarists and singers who used drugs, and both are heroes at the end.\n\nCharlie (Hieronymus) Pace is named after the Austrian theologian and historian Hieronymus Pez. This is in keeping with many of the characters in \"Lost\" who are named after famous philosophers and theologians, although the name Charlie Pace is also the name of one early member of the Branch Davidian sect that was raided in Waco, Texas in 1993.\n\nIn a DVD commentary for \"The Moth\", Monaghan said he felt Charlie's black hoodie is some sort of \"security blanket\" that he hides underneath and uses when he feels \"lost\".\n\nIn a Season One DVD featurette, \"Backstage with Driveshaft\", Dominic Monaghan cites several bands as a direct influence on the fictional band:\n\nMonaghan adds:\n\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Dominic Monaghan returned and confirmed that he would be back in \"Lost\"'s final season as Charlie Pace for three episodes.\n\nChris Carabott responded positively to the utilization of the character in \"The Moth\", mentioning, \"Dini and Johnson use the various talents of some of the \"losties\" to further emphasize Charlie's uselessness,\" and \"Charlie's development throughout the episode is striking.\" However, he did express dissatisfaction at how he was used in season two, believing it took away from a \"gem of an episode.\" In \"Homecoming\", he commented on his \"good nature\" and mentioned his flashback \"does a great job of contrasting the Charlie we now know on the island.\"\n\nIn his review of \"Live Together, Die Alone\", Scott Brown of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the writers were \"trying to make us hate Charlie.\" calling him \"deeply annoying\".\n\nIn a review of season three's penultimate episode, Chris Carabott said Charlie's flashbacks could \"send shivers up our collective spines,\" and said he was \"annoying at times.\" Nonetheless, he called the character \"someone we can respect.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Jeff Jensen said Charlie \"was ready for the spotlight\", and Monaghan gave his \"best performance yet\".\" On BuddyTV, his flashbacks were described as bringing audiences \"closer to Charlie's human aspect\", and it was noted the episode was \"wildly successful\" in turning Charlie into a relatable character.\n\nThe website Television Without Pity ranked him 7th in a list of \"Lost's\" \"10 Most Worthless Characters\", dubbing his backstory \"\"Oasis: Behind the Music\"\". Contrastingly, in a list of the show's \"10 Best Backstories\", he was ranked 8th. A poll by E! Online named him as the character fans would most like to see return at 43.4% of the vote, more than 30 percentage points higher than his nearest rival.\n\nThe one-hit song \"You All Everybody\" created for Drive Shaft was made available to players of the video game series \"Rock Band\" through the Rock Band Network, shortly after the airing of the \"Lost\" series finale alongside Geronimo Jackson's \"Dharma Lady\".\n\n"}

Claire is introduced in the pilot episode as a pregnant crash survivor. She is a series regular until her mysterious disappearance in the fourth season finale. The character returned as a regular in the sixth season.\n\nClaire was raised in Sydney by her mother, Carole (Susan Duerden), who told her that her father had died. When she is a teenager, she and her mother are involved in a car accident which leaves Carole in a coma. Christian Shephard (John Terry) pays for Carole's medical care and reveals himself as Claire's father. When he suggests that Claire turn off her mother's life support, she is angry and leaves without learning his name.\n\nYears later, Claire becomes pregnant by her then-boyfriend, Thomas (Keir O'Donnell). He convinces her to keep the baby but leaves her a few months later. Claire considers giving the child up for adoption. She then visits a psychic, Richard Malkin (Nick Jameson), who insists she raise the child herself, because \"danger surrounds this baby.\" Scared by his vehemence, Claire says she plans to have the baby adopted. Claire begins to sign the document to finalize the adoption, but the pen runs out of ink; the lawyer hands her another and it too fails to work. Before she tries a third pen, Claire changes her mind and leaves the room. She visits Malkin a second time, and he tells her about a couple living in Los Angeles who are interested in adopting her baby. He gives Claire a ticket for Oceanic Flight 815, which is to leave the next day, insisting it has to be that flight — and that flight only — that she must take. Weeks later, Claire believes Malkin foresaw the plane crash, meaning she would have to raise her child herself.\n\nClaire panics as she hasn't felt the baby move after the crash and is helped by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). She passes out from dehydration but when Jack tells them about some caves and a freshwater stream, Claire stays on the beach, claiming the move into the caves would be accepting their fate as long-term inhabitants.\n\nShe bonds with survivor Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan). They grow closer and Charlie persuades her to move to the caves, where Claire has nightmares. She insists someone is trying to interfere with or hurt her unborn child, but Jack insists her nightmares are stress-related and tries to give her sedatives. Annoyed, Claire leaves the caves with Charlie but returns, wanting Jack there when she gives birth. On the way back, she and Charlie are kidnapped by Ethan Rom (William Mapother). Charlie is rescued, but Claire remained missing for nearly two weeks. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) find Claire when she returns to the caves, suffering from amnesia. Ethan, however, demands Claire is returned to him, saying he will kill one survivor a day until he gets her back. The survivors keep this from Claire but she notices them treating her differently and eventually, Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) tells her about Ethan's threats when Claire demands an explanation. Against Charlie's wishes, Claire agrees to be bait to capture Ethan and Charlie kills him, later telling Jack that he wasn't going to let Ethan anywhere near Claire again and he deserved to die.\n\nLater, Locke seeks her help in making a cradle for her baby as a birthday gift. Days later, Claire has the baby, assisted by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Charlie. Claire is initially unable to calm him but James \"Sawyer\" Ford's (Josh Holloway) Southern accent solves the problem. Initially, she doesn't name him, but after Rousseau kidnaps him, she names him Aaron, begging Charlie and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to bring him back. She waits at the caves with Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Shannon until Charlie and Sayid return with him.\n\nClaire continues to struggle with her amnesia, and is annoyed by Charlie's attempts to play an almost fatherly role to Aaron. She unburdens herself to Locke, and jokes Charlie could be a religious freak with his Virgin Mary statues. The statues were found in the wreckage of a plane crash, each filled with heroin. Later, Claire is confronted by Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who tells her what was in the statues. Remembering Charlie mentioning his former drug addiction, she forbids him to approach her or Aaron. When Charlie steals Aaron, wanting to baptize him, Claire slaps him but later requests Eko baptize her and her son.\n\nLater, Aaron falls ill, prompting Claire to seek Libby Smith's (Cynthia Watros) expertise to help her unblock her repressed memories in order to find a cure. Remembering where Ethan took her, she and Kate head into the jungle to search for Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). They return to the Dharma station, but find it abandoned. Before leaving, Claire tells Rousseau her daughter, Alex (Tania Raymonde), helped her and is still alive. Upon returning to the beach, Aaron is well and Claire has recovered all the lost memories from after her abduction by Ethan. Charlie later approaches Claire, and gives her some vaccine for her and Aaron, which she accepts. While at Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby's funeral, Claire clasps Charlie's hand and later kisses him.\n\nDays later, Claire sees a flock of gulls flying overhead. She believes if she can catch one, they could send a distress message to the outside world. She asks Sun and Jin to help build a net to catch one of the birds, but Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) thwarts their attempt when he scares the birds away with gunfire. Angry with him and Charlie, she follows Desmond to a rocky cliff, where he gives her a bird and learns of Desmond's visions of Charlie's death. She comforts Charlie, and the two attach a note to the bird before releasing it. Later, Claire suddenly falls violently ill, due to the now activated implant Ethan put in her during her abduction. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) cures the illness as a means of earning the survivors' trust.\n\nWhen Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) addresses the camp about the world's perspective of their predicament, Claire expresses outrage they are considered dead. Later, when Karl (Blake Bashoff) arrives the next day with news of the Others' impending arrival, Claire goes with the rest of the camp to the radio tower. Soon after, Claire is delighted to hear Charlie has disabled the jamming device blocking all outgoing signals, but is worried he has not returned to shore.\n\nClaire and Sun tend to Aaron before heading back to the beach, following Jack's success in contacting the freighter. However, upon the two groups meeting by the cockpit, Claire learns of Charlie's death and his final warning. With this in mind, Claire decides to join Locke and move into the barracks, along with Hurley, Sawyer and three other unarmed castaways. Along the way, she and the rest of Locke's group encounter Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), who had parachuted onto the island. Claire is asleep when the barracks fall under attack. One of Martin Keamy's (Kevin Durand) men shoots an RPG at Claire's house, which explodes, but she is rescued by Sawyer. Upon safely leaving the barracks and its attackers, Claire, Sawyer and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) return to the beach. Several times during the journey, Miles stares at Claire strangely, prompting Sawyer to issue an impromptu 'restraining order'. She falls asleep in their camp that night and wakes to find her father, Christian, holding Aaron, and proceeds to follow him, leaving Aaron under a tree in the process. Later, when Locke enters Jacob's cabin, he finds Claire sitting there with Christian, claiming she and Aaron are fine where they are. Before Locke leaves, Christian cautions him Claire's whereabouts should remain a secret.\n\nAaron is one of the rescued Oceanic Six, and the general public are told he is Kate's son, while Claire is listed as among the passengers who did not survive the plane crash. At Christian Shephard's memorial service, Carole Littleton, who has recovered from her coma, tells Jack she and Christian had a relationship which produced Claire, revealing her to be Jack's half-sister. Eventually, before departing to return to the island, Kate reveals to Carole that Aaron is Claire's son. Kate tells Carole that she is going back to try to find Claire, and leaves Aaron with his grandmother.\n\nOn the Island, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) tells Jack that Claire has been consumed by the same \"infection\" that threatens Sayid. At about the same time, Jin is attacked by men from the temple, and then rescued by Claire, who has adapted to an existence on the Island like Rousseau's. She tells Jin about a friend she now has on the island, the fake John Locke — of whose falsity she is aware. Claire reveals that she's been searching for Aaron and believes the people in the Temple have him. Observing Claire's erratic behavior, Jin decides not to convince her otherwise. She therefore plans to invade the temple to find her son.\n\nThe Man in Black then sends Claire to the Temple as an emissary for him to communicate with the Others' leader, Dogen. However, Dogen orders the Others to take Claire captive, so they put her in a large pit within the Temple. When Kate returns, she demands to see Claire and finds her there, singing \"Catch a Falling Star\". Kate reveals to Claire that she took and raised Aaron, but Claire is not happy about it. After the Monster's attack on the Temple, the pair escape and join the Man in Black and his new group of defected Others.\n\nAs the Man in Black's party continues their journey, Claire attacks Kate. Their leader intervenes, stopping Claire violently. Claire later apologizes to Kate and thanks her for saving Aaron. Claire questions the Man in Black's intentions for her, expressing her fear that he doesn't need her to be on the plane on which he plans to escape. The Man in Black reassures her that he wants her to be reunited with her child. When asked about Kate, the Man in Black reveals that she is simply a means to an end. Claire later turns against and flees from the Man in Black after he allows Jin, Sun and Sayid to die on Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) submarine. She becomes fearful of him and is hostile towards Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), Miles and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) when she believes that they have been sent to kill her. They fail to convince her to accompany them off the Island as it collapses, owing to Desmond accidentally extinguishing the light in the source of the Island. When Kate and Sawyer arrive on Hydra Island and find her, Claire admits to shame of what she has become, and believes that Aaron is better off without her. Kate assures Claire that her worries are normal, and promises to help her. The trio board the plane with Richard, Frank and Miles and fly home.\n\nClaire is the passenger in a taxi Kate Austen hijacks at gunpoint in order to escape Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne). When the driver runs from the taxi and Kate takes over as driver, she forces Claire to exit the vehicle and leave her belongings behind. Kate later regrets this and gives Claire a ride to the house of the couple who are adopting her baby. Claire asks Kate to come in with her, and finds out the couple has split up and the wife does not feel she can raise Claire's child alone. She then experiences contractions and Kate brings her to the hospital where she is treated by Dr. Goodspeed (Ethan Rom) He tells her at 36 weeks, she could deliver a healthy baby; however, because she does not feel she is ready, she chooses to be treated with drugs stabilizing her. When the baby's heartbeat momentarily cannot be found, Claire instinctively calls her child \"Aaron.\" In thanks for her assistance, Claire covers for Kate and gives her a credit card, enabling her to escape.\n\nAt some later point, Jack Shephard and his mother learn of Claire Littleton's existence when they find her name in Christian's last will and testament. Soon afterward, partly by chance and partly through Desmond's machinations, Claire and Jack find each other, and Jack has her stay with him and his son David (Dylan Minnette), as they are family.\n\nLater on, Claire attends a concert with David. Desmond has brought Kate there, and Charlie's band Driveshaft is performing that night. Claire locks eyes with Charlie, and they both feel the first stirrings of recognition. She then goes into labour and gives birth backstage, being helped by Kate, just like before on the island. This reawakens Claire and Kate's memories of the island. After this, Charlie also remembers their lives on the island, and he and Claire have an emotional reunion. They are later seen at the church with everybody else as Christian opens the doors and allows them to move on.\n\nThe producers thought it was essential an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, as it was always planned to be a multi-cultural show, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so she was unable to go to the auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience.\n\nEmilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, Born in Sydney, Australia. She was originally auditioned for the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming it would just be a recurring role. While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters. She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that \"in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the muggiest weather in the rainforest... You're really exposed to the elements.\" The actress admitted being \"creeped out\" by the premise of \"Raised by Another\", in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby.\n\nEmilie de Ravin did not return as a series regular for the fifth season, but had a \"holding contract\" and returned as a regular in the sixth season.\n"}

{"id": "2230989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230989", "title": "Space Shuttle thermal protection system", "text": "Space Shuttle thermal protection system\n\nThe Space Shuttle thermal protection system (TPS) is the barrier that protected the Space Shuttle Orbiter during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. A secondary goal was to protect from the heat and cold of space while in orbit.\n\nThe TPS covered essentially the entire orbiter surface, and consisted of seven different materials in varying locations based on amount of required heat protection:\n\n\nEach type of TPS had specific heat protection, impact resistance, and weight characteristics, which determined the locations where it was used and the amount used.\n\nThe shuttle TPS has three key characteristics that distinguish it from the TPS used on previous spacecraft:\n\n\nThe orbiter's aluminum structure could not withstand temperatures over without structural failure.\nAerodynamic heating during reentry would push the temperature well above this level in areas, so an effective insulator was needed.\n\nReentry heating differs from the normal atmospheric heating associated with jet aircraft, and this governed TPS design and characteristics. The skin of high-speed jet aircraft can also become hot, but this is from frictional heating due to atmospheric friction, similar to warming one's hands by rubbing them together. The orbiter reentered the atmosphere as a blunt body by having a very high (40°) angle of attack, with its broad lower surface facing the direction of flight. Over 80% of the heating the orbiter experiences during reentry is caused by compression of the air ahead of the hypersonic vehicle, in accordance with the basic thermodynamic relation between pressure and temperature. A hot shock wave was created in front of the vehicle, which deflected most of the heat and prevented the orbiter's surface from directly contacting the peak heat. Therefore, reentry heating was largely convective heat transfer between the shock wave and the orbiter's skin through superheated plasma. The key to a reusable shield against this type of heating is very low-density material, similar to how a thermos bottle inhibits convective heat transfer.\n\nSome high-temperature metal alloys can withstand reentry heat; they simply get hot and re-radiate the absorbed heat. This technique, called \"heat sink\" thermal protection, was planned for the X-20 Dyna-Soar winged space vehicle. However, the amount of high-temperature metal required to protect a large vehicle like the Space Shuttle Orbiter would have been very heavy and entailed a severe penalty to the vehicle's performance. Similarly, ablative TPS would be heavy, possibly disturb vehicle aerodynamics as it burned off during reentry, and require significant maintenance to reapply after each mission. (Unfortunately, TPS tile, which was originally specified never to take debris strikes during launch, in practice also needed to be closely inspected and repaired after each landing, due to damage invariably incurred during ascent, even before new on-orbit inspection policies were established following the loss of Space Shuttle \"Columbia\".)\n\nThe TPS was a system of different protection types, not just silica tiles. They are in two basic categories: tile TPS and non-tile TPS. The main selection criteria used the lightest weight protection capable of handling the heat in a given area. However, in some cases a heavier type was used if additional impact resistance was needed. The FIB blankets were primarily adopted for reduced maintenance, not for thermal or weight reasons.\n\nMuch of the shuttle was covered with LI-900 silica tiles, made from essentially very pure quartz sand. The insulation prevented heat transfer to the underlying orbiter aluminum skin and structure. These tiles were such poor heat conductors that one could hold one by the edges while it was still red hot.\nThere were about 24,300 unique tiles individually fitted on the vehicle, for which the orbiter has been called \"the flying brickyard\". Researchers at University of Minnesota and Pennsylvania State University are performing the atomistic simulations to obtain accurate description of interactions between atomic and molecular oxygen with silica surfaces to develop better high-temperature oxidation-protection systems for leading edges on hypersonic vehicles.\n\nThe tiles were not mechanically fastened to the vehicle, but glued. Since the brittle tiles could not flex with the underlying vehicle skin, they were glued to Nomex felt Strain Isolation Pads (SIPs) with room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone adhesive, which were in turn glued to the orbiter skin. These isolated the tiles from the orbiter's structural deflections and expansions.\n\nThe black HRSI tiles provided protection against temperatures up to . There were 20,548 HRSI tiles which covered the landing gear doors, external tank umbilical connection doors, and the rest of the orbiter's under surfaces. They were also used in areas on the upper forward fuselage, parts of the orbital maneuvering system pods, vertical stabilizer leading edge, elevon trailing edges, and upper body flap surface. They varied in thickness from , depending upon the heat load encountered during reentry. Except for closeout areas, these tiles were normally square. The HRSI tile was composed of high purity silica fibers. Ninety percent of the volume of the tile was empty space, giving it a very low density () making it light enough for spaceflight. The uncoated tiles were bright white in appearance and looked more like a solid ceramic than the foam-like material that they were.\n\nThe black coating on the tiles was Reaction Cured Glass (RCG) of which tetrasilicide and borosilicate glass were some of several ingredients. RCG was applied to all but one side of the tile to protect the porous silica and to increase the heat sink properties. The coating was absent from a small margin of the sides adjacent to the uncoated (bottom) side. To waterproof the tile, dimethylethoxysilane was injected into the tiles by syringe. Densifying the tile with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) also helped to protect the silica and added additional waterproofing.\nAn uncoated HRSI tile held in the hand feels like a very light foam, less dense than styrofoam, and the delicate, friable material must be handled with extreme care to prevent damage. The coating feels like a thin, hard shell and encapsulates the white insulating ceramic to resolve its friability, except on the uncoated side. Even a coated tile feels very light, lighter than a same-sized block of styrofoam. As expected for silica, they are odorless and inert.\n\nHRSI was primarily designed to withstand transition from areas of extremely low temperature (the void of space, about ) to the high temperatures of re-entry (caused by interaction, mostly compression at the hypersonic shock, between the gases of the upper atmosphere & the hull of the Space Shuttle, typically around ).\n\nThe black FRCI tiles provided improved durability, resistance to coating cracking and weight reduction. Some HRSI tiles were replaced by this type.\n\nA stronger, tougher tile which came into use in 1996. TUFI tiles came in high temperature black versions for use in the orbiter's underside, and lower temperature white versions for use on the upper body. While more impact resistant than other tiles, white versions conducted more heat which limited their use to the orbiter's upper body flap and main engine area. Black versions had sufficient heat insulation for the orbiter underside but had greater weight. These factors restricted their use to specific areas.\n\nWhite in color, these covered the upper wing near the leading edge. They were also used in selected areas of the forward, mid, and aft fuselage, vertical tail, and the OMS/RCS pods. These tiles protected areas where reentry temperatures are below . The LRSI tiles were manufactured in the same manner as the HRSI tiles, except that the tiles were square and had a white RCG coating made of silica compounds with shiny aluminum oxide. The white color was by design and helped to manage heat on orbit when the orbiter was exposed to direct sunlight.\n\nThese tiles were reusable for up to 100 missions with refurbishment (100 missions was also the design lifetime of each orbiter). They were carefully inspected in the Orbiter Processing Facility after each mission, and damaged or worn tiles were immediately replaced before the next mission. Fabric sheets known as gap fillers were also inserted between tiles where necessary. These allowed for a snug fit between tiles, preventing excess plasma from penetrating between them, yet allowing for thermal expansion and flexing of the underlying vehicle skin.\n\nPrior to the introduction of FIB blankets, LRSI tiles occupied all of the areas now covered by the blankets, including the upper fuselage and the whole surface of the OMS pods. This TPS configuration was only used on \"Columbia\" and \"Challenger\".\n\nDeveloped after the initial delivery of \"Columbia\" and first used on the OMS pods of \"Challenger\". This white low-density fibrous silica batting material had a quilt-like appearance, and replaced the vast majority of the LRSI tiles. They required much less maintenance than LRSI tiles yet had about the same thermal properties. After their limited use on \"Challenger\", they were used much more extensively beginning with \"Discovery\" and replaced many of the LRSI tiles on \"Columbia\" after the loss of \"Challenger\".\n\nThe light gray material which withstood reentry temperatures up to protected the wing leading edges and nose cap. Each of the orbiters' wings had 22 RCC panels about thick. T-seals between each panel allowed for thermal expansion and lateral movement between these panels and the wing.\n\nRCC was a laminated composite material made from carbon fibres impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate was pyrolized to convert the resin to pure carbon. This was then impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, then cured and pyrolized again to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. This process was repeated three times until the desired carbon-carbon properties were achieved.\n\nTo provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC were coated with silicon carbide. The silicon-carbide coating protected the carbon-carbon from oxidation. The RCC was highly resistant to fatigue loading that was experienced during ascent and entry. It was stronger than the tiles and was also used around the socket of the forward attach point of the orbiter to the External Tank to accommodate the shock loads of the explosive bolt detonation. RCC was the only TPS material that also served as structural support for part of the orbiter's aerodynamic shape: the wing leading edges and the nose cap. All other TPS components (tiles and blankets) were mounted onto structural materials that supported them, mainly the aluminum frame and skin of the orbiter.\n\nThis white, flexible fabric offered protection at up to . FRSI covered the orbiter's upper wing surfaces, upper payload bay doors, portions of the OMS/RCS pods, and aft fuselage.\n\nGap fillers were placed at doors and moving surfaces to minimize heating by preventing the formation of vortices. Doors and moving surfaces created open gaps in the heat protection system that had to be protected from heat. Some of these gaps were safe, but there were some areas on the heat shield where surface pressure gradients caused a crossflow of boundary layer air in those gaps.\n\nThe filler materials were made of either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers). These materials were used around the leading edge of the nose cap, windshields, side hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, vertical stabilizer, the rudder/speed brake, body flap, and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines.\n\nOn STS-114, some of this material was dislodged and determined to pose a potential safety risk. It was possible that the gap filler could cause turbulent airflow further down the fuselage, which would result in much higher heating, potentially damaging the orbiter. The cloth was removed during a spacewalk during the mission.\n\nWhile reinforced carbon–carbon had the best heat protection characteristics, it was also much heavier than the silica tiles and FIBs, so it was limited to relatively small areas. In general the goal was to use the lightest weight insulation consistent with the required thermal protection. Density of each TPS type:\n\nTotal area and weight of each TPS type (used on Orbiter 102, pre-1996):\n\nTiles often fell off and caused much of the delay in the launch of STS-1, the first shuttle mission, which was originally scheduled for 1979 but did not occur until April 1981. NASA was unused to lengthy delays in its programs, and was under great pressure from the government and military to launch soon. In March 1979 it moved the incomplete \"Columbia\", with 7,800 of the 31,000 tiles missing, from the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale, California to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Beyond creating the appearance of progress in the program, NASA hoped that the tiling could be finished while the rest of the orbiter was prepared. This was a mistake; some of the Rockwell tilers disliked Florida and soon returned to California, and the Orbiter Processing Facility was not designed for manufacturing and was too small for its 400 workers.\n\nEach tile used cement that required 16 hours to cure. After the tile was affixed to the cement, a jack held it in place for another 16 hours. In March 1979 it took each worker 40 hours to install one tile; by using young, efficient college students during the summer the pace sped up to 1.8 tiles per worker per week. Thousands of tiles failed stress tests and had to be replaced. By fall NASA realized that the speed of tiling would determine the launch date. The tiles were so problematic that officials would have switched to any other thermal protection method, but none other existed.\n\nBecause it had to be ferried without all tiles the gaps were filled with material to maintain the Shuttle's aerodynamics while in transit.\n\nThe tile TPS was an area of concern during shuttle development, mainly concerning adhesion reliability. Some engineers thought a failure mode could exist whereby one tile could detach, and resulting aerodynamic pressure would create a \"zipper effect\" stripping off other tiles. Whether during ascent or reentry, the result would be disastrous.\n\nAnother problem was ice or other debris impacting the tiles during ascent. This had never been fully and thoroughly solved, as the debris had never been eliminated, and the tiles remained susceptible to damage from it. NASA's final strategy for mitigating this problem was to aggressively inspect for, assess, and address any damage that may occur, while on orbit and before reentry, in addition to on the ground between flights.\n\nThese concerns were sufficiently great that NASA did significant work developing an emergency-use tile repair kit which the STS-1 crew could use before deorbiting. By December 1979, prototypes and early procedures were completed, most of which involved equipping the astronauts with a special in-space repair kit and a jet pack called the Manned Maneuvering Unit, or MMU, developed by Martin Marietta.\n\nAnother element was a maneuverable work platform which would secure an MMU-propelled spacewalking astronaut to the fragile tiles beneath the orbiter. The concept used electrically-controlled adhesive cups which would lock the work platform into position on the featureless tile surface. About one year before the 1981 STS-1 launch, NASA decided the repair capability was not worth the additional risk and training, so discontinued development. There were unresolved problems with the repair tools and techniques; also further tests indicated the tiles were unlikely to come off. The first shuttle mission did suffer several tile losses, but they were in non-critical areas, and no \"zipper effect\" occurred.\n\nOn February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" was destroyed on reentry due to a failure of the TPS. The investigation team found and reported that the probable cause of the accident was that during launch, a piece of foam debris punctured a RCC panel on the left wing's leading edge and allowed hot gases from the reentry to enter the wing and disintegrate the wing from within, leading to eventual loss of control and breakup of the shuttle.\n\nThe Space Shuttle's thermal protection system received a number of controls and modifications after the disaster. They were applied to the three remaining shuttles, \"Discovery\", \"Atlantis\" and \"Endeavour\" in preparation for subsequent mission launches into space.\n\nOn 2005's STS-114 mission, in which \"Discovery\" made the first flight to follow the \"Columbia\" accident, NASA took a number of steps to verify that the TPS was undamaged. The Orbiter Boom Sensor System, a new extension to the Remote Manipulator System, was used to perform laser imaging of the TPS to inspect for damage. Prior to docking with the International Space Station, \"Discovery\" performed a Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver, simply a 360° backflip rotation, allowing all areas of the vehicle to be photographed from ISS. Two gap fillers were protruding from the orbiter's underside more than the nominally allowed distance, and the agency cautiously decided it would be best to attempt to remove the fillers or cut them flush rather than risk the increased heating they would cause. Even though each one protruded less than , it was believed that leaving them could cause heating increases of 25% upon reentry.\n\nBecause the orbiter did not have any handholds on its underside (as they would cause much more trouble with reentry heating than the protruding gap fillers of concern), astronaut Stephen K. Robinson worked from the ISS's robotic arm, Canadarm2. Because the TPS tiles were quite fragile, there had been concern that anyone working under the vehicle could cause more damage to the vehicle than was already there, but NASA officials felt that leaving the gap fillers alone was a greater risk. In the event, Robinson was able to pull the gap fillers free by hand, and caused no damage to the TPS on \"Discovery\".\n\n, with the impending Space Shuttle retirement, NASA is donating TPS tiles to schools, universities, and museums for the cost of shipping -- US$23.40 each. About 7000 tiles were available on a first-come, first-served basis, but limited to one each per institution.\n\n\n\n"}

The character was originally conceived by creator J. J. Abrams, though the direction of storylines owes more to co-creator Damon Lindelof and fellow showrunner Carlton Cuse. Abrams, the creator of \"Lost\", once told \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Jack Shephard may be the greatest leader in any television series.\" Actor Matthew Fox would have some influence on the character during the course of the series' production. For example, Fox's own tattoos were incorporated into the character's backstory. Although at an early stage in the show's development, the character was originally intended to die in the pilot, the writers soon changed this plan, and Jack became the show's main character from its pilot episode onwards.\n\nThe \"de facto\" leader of the crash survivors, in the show's first four seasons, Jack is very much a man of science. He serves as the antithesis of man of faith John Locke; however, his experiences in season five mold Jack into a believer, to the point of becoming John Locke's spiritual successor in the final season. His leadership role culminates in him taking briefly over as protector of the island from its immortal guardian, Jacob, and being the one to engage one of the series' villains, the Man in Black (who has ironically taken on Locke's appearance), in a climactic battle to the death. Jack's storylines have included the exploration of his relationships with various love interests: fellow survivor Kate Austen, and Juliet Burke, who is initially a member of the mysterious Others, who are the series' visible antagonists for the majority of its run. Other key relationships in the show involve Claire Littleton, whom he discovers is his half-sister; Hurley as his right-hand man; and Sawyer, his rival for the affections of Kate, even when at some points, Sawyer calls him the nearest thing he has as a friend.\n\nPrior to the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, Jack was born into a successful family, with aspirations of following in his father's footsteps. He attended Columbia University and graduated from medical school a year earlier than his classmates.\n\nDespite Jack's gifts as a physician, he is haunted by his relationship with his father, a neurosurgeon at St. Sebastian Hospital. Jack exposes his father's alcoholism, ending his career. In September 2004, Jack's mother, Margo, (Veronica Hamel) orders him to find Christian, who has exiled himself to Australia, and bring him back. Jack goes to Sydney and finds that his father has died. Once Jack identified his father's body, he made arrangements to bring him home. Jack boards Oceanic 815 bound for Los Angeles on September 22, 2004, with his father's casket in the cargo hold.\n\nOn the island, Jack plays a key role in the survival of his fellow survivors in the immediate aftermath of the crash, instructing others to help those with injuries and using his medical background to assist the wounded. The survivors look to Jack as their leader; however, he is reluctant to embrace the position and repeats his father's rationale that he does not \"have what it takes\". Exhausted from tending the wounded, attempts to rescue drowning survivors and sleep-deprived, Jack begins chasing hallucinations of his father in the jungle. He drops his skepticism when he finds his father's coffin but it is empty. Struggling to cope with demands made by the castaways, he meets John Locke in the jungle, who provides some guidance for Jack's leadership. Jack returns to the beach camp and gives a speech on how they are going to live on the island and tells them about the caves; one part of his speech—\"live together, die alone\"—becomes a mantra amongst the survivors. Through his medical tending and visibility within the camp, Jack quickly develops many personal relationships with the castaways, most notably finding a romantic interest in Kate Austen, a right-hand man in Hurley Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and a mutual respect for former military torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews).\n\nThroughout the series, it has been stated numerous times that Jack is a natural leader. These things have been demonstrated many times by his ability to think quickly and analyze crisis situations. Jack intentionally represses fear and anxiety, usually in order to remain strong for other people, as he is the one they turn to during crises. Initially, he rejects claims of fellow survivors, such as Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) and John Locke, who believe they are on the Island for a reason and that the Island has mystic properties. He does this to not give his fellow survivors false hope. On the Island, Jack also seems to repress his feelings for Kate Austen. However, after escaping from The Island, Jack and Kate admit their love, move in together, and raise Aaron, Claire's son.\n\nJack's habit of repression sometimes does flare out, usually in his propensity to become violent when he is enraged. He is also prone to become highly obsessive and willing to do anything to help the survivors, even if it's to his detriment. This aspect was noted by his father when he was a child, suggesting that Jack avoid being a hero because he doesn't have \"what it takes\" to keep a level head when things go wrong. Jack is, deep down, a very caring person and has sacrificed himself for his crash-mates several times. After being rescued, he sinks into alcoholism and drug abuse out of severe depression. He blames himself for leaving almost all the fellow survivors behind while he was safely rescued. This leads to his delusions that his father is still alive and a suicide attempt, which indicate that Jack has not been completely able to cope with what happened on the island. \"Digital Spy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ben Rawson-Jones marked a \"difference in the characterization of Jack [who] has become known as the trustworthy, honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed, so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic\".\n\nAfter being rescued and falling into depression, Jack was visited by Locke one last time, to convince him to return to the island. Though he failed, Jack's outlook underwent a fundamental change. He began to believe in fate and destiny. When Juliet asked Jack why he eventually did return to the island, Jack told her \"because I was supposed to\". Jack's faith leads him to sacrifice himself to prevent the island's destruction. He believed that saving the island was what he was \"meant to do\" and the only thing that could give him the peace he did not find when he was off-island.\n\nIn the original outline of \"Lost\", Jack was going to be killed halfway through the first episode. \"Lost\" co-creator J. J. Abrams was interested in Michael Keaton for the role, as Abrams wanted to work with him. However, scripts were never even sent to him, as the character was made into a regular, and Keaton wasn't interested in a series. The producers felt that if the audience became attached to the character during the first episode, and then he was killed, they might resent the show. His death was meant to shock the audience so they would never know what would happen next. The role ended up going to Matthew Fox, who was \"very excited\" about it, as it was the genre and tone he was looking for.\n\nFor story purposes, the tattoos on Jack's arm read: \"He walks among us, but he is not one of us.\" However, Matthew Fox already had the tattoos when he started on \"Lost\". The producers considered putting make-up over them but, instead, decided to keep them and just fit them in with the plot.\n\nAccording to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo is made up of four Chinese characters (; \"鹰\", hawk; \"击\", strike or attack; \"长\", long; \"空\", space or sky) from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925, and the Lebanese Phalangist symbol. Fox's tattoo translates to \"Eagles high up, cleaving the space\".\n\nIn an interview, Fox said that, for him, getting a tattoo is a \"pretty intense experience\" and something he would not do in the \"spur of the moment\". He thought it was a \"really cool idea\" for Jack to have tattoos. Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.\n\nCritical and viewer opinion has been positive for Matthew Fox's Jack Shephard. \"BuddyTV\" praised Matthew Fox's lead role performance in \"Through the Looking Glass\" as \"Emmy worthy\" \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Karla Peterson praised Fox's work in \"Something Nice Back Home\", \"The Palm Beach Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kevin Thompson \"thought [that] Matthew [Fox] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, jealousy, just to name a few\" in the same episode.\n\nMatthew Fox won a Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Television Series for his role as Jack in 2004. He was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2006 for Best Actor in a television series – Drama and a Television Critics Association award in 2005 for Individual Achievement in Drama. He has also won two Saturn awards, including Best Actor on Television in 2005 and Best Actor in a Television Program in 2007. In 2010, Fox received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n"}

Seacer was a founding member of Prince's The New Power Generation in 1991, switching from bass to the band's guitarist.

{"id": "2230999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230999", "title": "Kate Austen", "text": "Kate Austen\n\nKatherine Anne \"Kate\" Austen is a fictional character on the ABC television series \"Lost\", played by Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly. Before the pilot was shot, and during the writing phase, Kate was to emerge as the leader for the survivors, motivating them to build shelter and begin considering life as permanent residents of the island, however when it was decided Jack should survive, she was a second-in-command.\n\nIn this original description for Kate, she was a slightly older woman separated from her husband, who went to the bathroom in the tail-section of the plane. However, that idea ended up being used for Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and her husband Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson). Kate is involved in a love triangle with Jack (Matthew Fox) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and is seen as very protective of Claire (Emilie de Ravin) and her baby Aaron.\n\nCritical reception of Kate has generally been negative. Criticisms were directed toward her uninteresting character and being weakly or inconsistently written.\n\nBorn in 1977 and raised in Iowa, Kate is the daughter of diner worker Diane (Beth Broderick), and Sam (Lindsey Ginter), a U.S. Army Ranger and Gulf War Veteran. At an early age Kate's parents divorced, and Diane married an abusive alcoholic named Wayne Janssen (James Horan). As an adult, Kate killed Wayne, which she confessed to her mother before disappearing. Wayne had always been abusive to her mother, but Kate decided to kill him upon learning that he was her biological father. Diane called the authorities; thereafter Kate is pursued and ultimately arrested by Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne).\n\nKate fled to Miami under the alias \"Monica\", where she dated and soon married a police officer named Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion). After a pregnancy scare and Kevin's purchase of two Oceanic tickets to Costa Rica for their honeymoon, Kate confessed her fugitive past and laced his drink with a sedative before disappearing. After months of traveling around the country under numerous aliases, Kate learned that Diane was dying of cancer, and decided to visit her. She reunited with her high-school sweetheart, Dr. Tom Brennan (Mackenzie Astin), who arranged a meeting between Kate and Diane. As Kate tried to apologize to her, Diane started screaming for help, prompting Kate to flee the hospital with Tom. A policeman opened fire on their getaway car, killing Tom and forcing Kate to flee the scene of the accident.\n\nMonths later Kate staged a robbery in New Mexico with several criminals to infiltrate a bank's safe deposit box. Tom's toy airplane was being stored in box 815, the same number as the crashed flight number. She fled to Australia where, while sleeping in a barn, she was discovered by a farmer, Ray Mullens (Nick Tate). Posing as a Canadian hiker, Kate worked on the farm for three months. When the farmer caught her attempting to sneak away, he offered her a ride into town the next morning. During the journey however, Kate discovered that the farmer had found out her true identity and notified Edward Mars of her whereabouts. Kate grabbed the wheel and crashed the truck into a field but instead of running, she helped the unconscious farmer from his vehicle, giving Mars time to pursue and arrest her. Escorting her to the airport in handcuffs, Mars briefed local security officers on Kate's fugitive past and revealed his locked carry-on case containing four firearms (and a fifth in an ankle holster). As the plane was bombarded with escalating turbulence, Mars was knocked unconscious by luggage from the overhead compartment. Kate stole the keys to the handcuffs and attached an oxygen mask to Mars and for herself, as the plane splintered and crashed onto the island.\n\nHaving survived the crash, Jack Shephard noticed Kate walking out of the jungle and asked her to stitch his wound, to which she agreed reluctantly. During their second day on the Island, Jack, Kate and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) went to retrieve the cockpit's transceiver from the plane debris. They tried to rescue the injured pilot, but the Smoke Monster attacked them. When they returned, Kate, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and several other survivors hiked to higher ground of the Island to transmit a distress signal on the transceiver.\n\nBack at the camp, Kate visited the injured marshal where he attempted to strangle her. Kate told Jack that he should euthanize the dying man, but Jack questioned her true motives when he learned about her criminal record. She went on a mission to triangulate the distress signal, and helped an injured Michael Dawson back to the camp. Jack suggested that the survivors move to the caves that he had discovered, but Kate refused because she was afraid of \"digging in\" and settling down.\n\nWhen Kate discovered the marshal's case, she and Sawyer had several fights to possess it. Eventually, Kate asked Jack for his help; he retrieved the case and decided that he should open it with Kate. Inside the case was Tom's toy plane. Jack questioned her about the toy, and she admitted the plane belonged to the man that she loved and killed.\n\nKate, along with Jack, attempted to track down Claire and Charlie when they were kidnapped by Ethan. They were able to find and revive a hanging Charlie. Later, she helped to capture Ethan. Kate was forced to deliver Claire's baby by herself while Jack was trying to save Boone's life.\n\nKate tried to gain a place on Michael's raft by attempting to steal Sawyer's and Jin's places. She convinced Jin's wife, Sun, to poison his water to ensure that he would not be able to travel on the raft. In preparation for the trip, Kate stole a dead woman's passport to assume her identity. However, Michael accused Sawyer of Michael's poisoning, which led to Sawyer revealing her fugitive status to the other survivors.\n\nAfter Rousseau arrived on the beach to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival; she directed Kate, Jack, Locke, and Hurley to the Black Rock, where they attempted to carry dynamite to the hatch that was discovered in the jungle.\n\nKate and Locke descend into the hatch, Kate entering first. Once inside, she is locked up by Desmond. Kate arrives in a room with a computer, where she overpowers Desmond after Jack arrives. She accidentally damages the computer in the crossfire, causing Desmond to panic and flee. Kate is placed on a rotation to enter a certain set of numbers every 108 minutes into the computer, supposedly saving the world.\n\nWhile picking fruit Kate sees a black horse from her past. When she returns to the hatch she hallucinates that Wayne is channeled through unconscious injured Sawyer and Kate freaks out. Jack finds her alone in the jungle and tries to comfort her. Kate kisses Jack on impulse, then runs away once she realizes what she's done. She eventually returns to the Hatch to tend Sawyer. They venture outside and both witness the black horse lingering nearby. When Michael runs off in search of his son, Kate follows him, but is kidnapped. After Jack refuses Tom's demands to hand over the guns, Kate is brought out and held at gunpoint to force the men to give up their guns.\n\nWhen Claire's baby falls ill, Kate joins her on a trek into the jungle to seek Rousseau's help. The three head inland, where they discover the station. Later, Kate and Jack discover a mysterious and unnoticed food drop in the jungle. They return to the hatch, where hostage \"Henry Gale\" is exposed as an impostor. Later, Kate joins Jack on a trek back to where they encountered the Others. The two make camp and Kate apologizes for kissing him in the jungle. Jack tells her that he is not sorry that she kissed him and they are about to kiss again when an exhausted Michael stumbles out of the bushes. Michael invites her to follow him to the Others' camp when he recovers. The next day, Kate, Jack, Sawyer and Hurley join Michael Dawson as they head for the Others' camp. They are ambushed, gagged, tied up and taken to a pier.\n\nKate is placed in a cage opposite Sawyer to work for the Others, under the eye of Pickett. Sawyer discovers they are actually on another island, and tries to keep the information from Kate so as to give her hope. When Jack contacts her via Pickett's radio, informing her that she has a head-start to escape, she and Sawyer run towards the beach. They encounter Alex, who gives them her boat \n\nWhen arriving on the beach, she scolds Sayid and Locke for not bothering to rescue Jack. They head into the jungle and find Rousseau, who agrees to help them after learning of Alex's status. The four trek into the jungle, where they discover the station. There they confront the Other Mikhail and take him hostage. The four resume their hike, eventually arriving at the Others' barracks, and see Jack socializing with the Others. That evening, Kate approaches Jack, but the Others capture Sayid and her. When they are alone, Jack explains to Kate that he has made a deal with The Others. In exchange for saving Ben's life, Jack will be allowed to return home. He promises Kate that he will come back for her and the rest of their friends. But Locke blows up the Other's submarine before Jack can leave. The following day, Kate is gassed by the Others and wakes up in the jungle, handcuffed to Juliet. They eventually return to the beach with Jack and Sayid.\n\nUpon returning, Kate is still wary of Juliet, and becomes especially jealous of Juliet's developing relationship with Jack. Later, she learns of Naomi's arrival. Kate is then shown Jack and Juliet's plan to deal with the Others' imminent attack while the majority travels to the radio tower. En route, Sawyer tells Kate that he's turning back to help the survivors on the beach. Kate wants to go with him, but Sawyer won't let her, and Jack defends Sawyer's actions, knowing that Sawyer is trying to protect Kate. When Kate asks why he is sticking up for Sawyer because she knows Sawyer would never stick up for Jack, Jack replies that it's because he (Jack) loves her. They eventually encounter Ben and Alex in the jungle, at which point Ben is taken hostage.\n\nKate follows a trail of Naomi's blood until being attacked by Naomi, who suddenly dies. After a confrontation between Jack and Locke, Kate decides to stay with Jack, but questions Sawyer when he decides to go with Locke. Later, they come across Daniel Faraday, whom they believe has arrived to rescue them. After finding Miles, Kate and Jack find themselves at gunpoint until she takes them to Naomi's body.\n\nLater, they team up with Frank, who managed to arrive on the island with the helicopter. Upon learning of the location of the final team member, Charlotte Staples Lewis, Kate accompanies Sayid and Miles to the barracks. They are eventually captured by Locke. Kate decides to remain at the barracks, in an attempt to extract information from Miles. She arranges for him to speak to Ben, but is caught by Locke. She spends the night with Sawyer (although they did not have sex) and tells him that she is not pregnant. They argue over his exaggerated show of relief. Sawyer accuses her of bouncing back and forth between him and Jack. Kate slaps him on the face and then heads back to the beach. When Sawyer returns with Miles and Aaron, she also takes over as Aaron's primary caretaker when Sawyer reveals that Claire has gone missing. Later, Sayid and Kate follow Jack and Sawyer to avoid them being attacked by the boat's soldiers. They meet up with the remaining Others and join forces to defeat the boat's soldiers. They all board Lapidus' helicopter, but as they travel back to the freighter a fuel leak is discovered, and after all the excess weight is thrown out, Sawyer kisses Kate, then asks her to do a favor for him back home and jumps out.\n\nIn \"Eggtown\", Kate goes on trial for her father's murder. Jack testifies on her behalf as a character witness. He lies under oath and tells the court that it was Kate that saved him and the other survivors. Under cross-examination, he is asked whether he loves the defendant and he replies \"Not anymore.\" Kate looks crestfallen and demands that Jack's testimony cease. Kate's mother, the prosecution's star witness, tries to reconcile with Kate, and then decides not to testify. She is consequently released on ten years probation, provided that she does not leave California. Kate meets ups with Jack after she is released and he confesses to her that he lied on the stand (about no longer loving her) and Kate is delighted. She invites him to come home with her, but he hesitates because he is not ready to see Aaron (his nephew) again. In \"Something Nice Back Home\", Kate is seen living in an established relationship with Jack, who is also acting as a surrogate father for his nephew Aaron. Later, Jack asks Kate to marry him, which she happily accepts. Jack later confronts Kate about her \"errands\", which involved her meeting with Sawyer's daughter; Clementine and his ex-girlfriend Cassidy. Kate refuses to tell Jack any details about this, as she knows Sawyer would not want anybody else to know. Jack is angered by her secrecy and raises his voice, waking Aaron up. Kate rushes to comfort him then Jack leaves, paranoid, ending their relationship.\nIn \"Through the Looking Glass\", Jack informs her of John Locke's funeral. Jack then tells her that they need to return to the island, but Kate grows furious and leaves.\n\nKate is surprisingly confronted by Dan Norton, a lawyer who is asking for a blood sample from both her and Aaron to determine their biological relationship. Norton refuses to tell Kate who his client is, and Kate refuses to give him a blood sample. Kate visits Sun, who convinces her to go see Norton and try to get him to reveal who his client is. Kate leaves Aaron in Sun's care while visiting Norton's firm, but cannot get a name out of him. Kate and Jack follow Norton to his clients house, who turns out to be Claire's mother. Jack goes in to talk to her and then realizes that she isn't the client they were looking for. When approached by Ben later, Kate discovers that he was the one who was trying to get a blood sample from her.\n\nKate realizes that she is not supposed to raise Aaron and leaves him in the care of Claire's mother. She goes to Jack's apartment and they spend the night together. She returns to the island with the other survivors on flight 316. Sawyer explains that the year is 1977 and secretly gets her, Jack and Hurley to join the Dharma Initiative. Sayid shoots a young Ben Linus and Kate and Sawyer save his life by bringing him to Richard Alpert. After refusing to aid Jack in his plans to detonate the hydrogen bomb, Kate returns to the Dharma Initiative, to then be put on the Dharma sub with Sawyer and Juliet. However, she insists that the three leave the submarine to prevent Jack from detonating the bomb. When the three return to the island, they eventually reunite with Jack, Jin, Sayid and Hurley. Although Sawyer tries to persuade Jack not to use the bomb, his efforts are in vain and they fight. Kate tells Jack that if he really believes that detonating the bomb is the best thing, then she will help him, while Sawyer reluctantly agrees to go along with the plan after Juliet also takes Jack's side. Kate assists Jack in getting the bomb to the required location, but when he drops it down a tunnel, it does not go off, despite the fact that it is supposed to explode on impact. Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Juliet are shocked, but immediately, the Dharma drill that had been drilling deep into the pocket of magnetic energy that Jack was trying to contain went too far, and Juliet is ultimately dragged down the tunnel, into the source of the energy. Kate and Sawyer try to get her out but the strength of the magnetism is too much and she is pulled into the tunnel. Kate attempts to remove a distressed Sawyer from the scene along with Jack, unaware that Juliet remains conscious for now and desperately attempts to detonate the bomb, eventually succeeding.\n\nKate continues her mission to reunite Claire with Aaron. When she eventually finds her, she discovers that a dark side has grown in Claire, who has become unstable due to many years of living alone, in the belief that the others are holding her son hostage in a Temple. Sawyer escapes from the Temple and Kate follows him to apologize for the loss of Juliet and to ask him to help her find Claire. Sawyer assures Kate she is not to blame, and reveals his intention to propose to Juliet. Kate breaks down, and ultimately returns to the Temple to get Claire. When Kate joins the Man in Black's camp, after Claire learns that it was Kate who took Aaron and attempts to murder Kate by throwing her to the ground and pulling a knife on her. Kate is saved by 'Locke' and seeing that Kate is upset by the loss of Claire's friendship, warns her that Claire should not be reunited with Aaron as she is now 'crazy'. Claire later tearfully apologises for her actions and thanks Kate for keeping her son safe.\n\nKate, (who has since grouped up with 'Locke') plans a breakout from the Man in Black's party, Kate wants to bring Claire but Sawyer refuses, saying she is no longer the friend they once knew following her attack on Kate. When Claire sees them leaving her behind again she gives chase and holds them at gunpoint just as they attempt to board a boat to escape. Kate talks Claire around, convincing her to come with them so she can finally go home to her son.\n\nThe group try to leave on Widmore's sub, and Kate is shot through the right collarbone. Once on board, while Jack is tending to Kate's wound, they discover that the Man in Black has placed a C4 explosive on board. Sawyer inadvertently causes the timer to count down faster and Sayid, Jin and Sun are killed in the resulting explosion. Jack asks Hurley to take care of Kate and make sure that he takes her to safety off the sinking vessel. On the shore, Kate races over to Jack and is relieved to find him safe. Kate, Jack and Hurley mourn the loss of their friends while Sawyer remains unconscious.\n\nAs the Man in Black starts to destroy the Island, Kate helps Jack kill him by shooting him. Jack is wounded in the fight with 'Locke' and he and Kate part for the final time due to their different destinies. Jack and Kate share a passionate kiss and declare their love for each other one last time before Jack leaves with Hurley to save the Island, and Kate goes to fulfill her promise to find Claire before departing on the Ajira plane, piloted by Frank. Along the way, they find Claire, who is scared to leave the island as she feels she is no longer a fit mother. Kate convinces her that her worries are normal and promises to help her. Kate escapes the island on the plane with Claire, Sawyer, Miles, Frank and Richard - Kate hand in hand with Claire.\n\nIn the Sideways, Kate remembers her life when she helps deliver Aaron at the concert. Kate waits at the concert so she can reunite with Jack. She finds him and tells him \"I've missed you so much\", a reference that she probably lived a long life after leaving the Island and missed Jack profoundly. Jack eventually awakens and remembers Kate and his friends. Together with Jack at her side, they move on together.\n\nAround 75 women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate, including Yunjin Kim, who later played the role of Sun-Hwa Kwon. In the initial plans, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode and then Kate would emerge as the leader. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's character. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in the United States. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time and, in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show. Executive producer Damon Lindelof told about Lilly's casting: \n\nMany critics have considered Kate Austen to be one of the more weakly written and uninteresting characters of \"Lost\". Alan Sepinwall of \"The Star-Ledger\" did not find Kate to be “nearly as compelling a central character as Sayid or Hurley (or some of the freighter people, for that matter).” In reviewing the episode \"What Kate Does\" in 2010, critic Todd Vanderwerff of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that though \"Kate's one of the show's most important characters... she's also one of the series' most obvious missed opportunities.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" said Lilly's performance in the season four episode \"Eggtown\" was worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Lilly's performance in \"Whatever Happened, Happened\" also received praise from TV critics and fans of the show alike. Lilly got a Golden Globe nomination for best dramatic actress in a lead role for her work in season 3.\n\nIn 2007, the character was voted #1 Sexiest Woman on Television by \"TV Guide\" and made \"FHM's\" Top Sexiest. Lifestyle website Beliefnet named her among the Top 10 Most Empowering Women on TV Today.\n"}

{"id": "2231003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231003", "title": "Shannon Rutherford", "text": "Shannon Rutherford\n\nShannon Rutherford is a fictional character played by Maggie Grace on the ABC drama television series \"Lost\", which chronicled the lives of the survivors of a plane crash in the South Pacific. Shannon was introduced in the pilot episode as the stepsister of fellow crash survivor Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder). She was a series regular until her funeral in \"What Kate Did\". For most of her time on the Island, she was unhelpful and spent much of her time sunbathing. She formed a relationship with another survivor from the plane crash, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). Shannon was accidentally shot by Ana Lucia Cortez who mistakes her for an Other.\n\nDuring the casting process, she was compared to Paris Hilton. Naveen Andrews, who played the character Sayid on the show, had the idea of encouraging the writers to write a romantic relationship between his character and Shannon into the story. Critics found her to be a largely unsympathetic character until only shortly before her death. Nonetheless, Grace received a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role as Shannon.\n\nWhen Shannon is eight, her father marries Sabrina Carlyle (Lindsay Frost), and she spends much of her adolescence with her stepbrother Boone. She studies ballet and, as she gets older, teaches dance classes to young girls. When she is eighteen, Shannon's father dies in a car crash. He did not have a will prepared, so all of his money and property goes to his wife. Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Unable to come up with the money herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair. Shannon later forms a plan to con her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle, into giving her some of the inheritance she rightly deserved. Playing on her knowledge of Boone's love for her, she makes it appear her boyfriend Brian abuses her. Boone pays Brian to leave her, and Shannon plans to secretly take half the money. During one con in Sydney, her \"abusive boyfriend\" ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States. When Shannon's boyfriend takes off with all of the money, Shannon goes to Boone's hotel room in Sydney, drunk, and Boone allows her to seduce him. After they have sex, Shannon tells Boone things will go back to the way they had been before. He expresses anger because, as always, they both know she is in control of their situation and relationship. The following morning at the Sydney airport, Sayid Jarrah approaches Shannon, asking her to watch his bag for him. She deftly obliges, but soon leaves it unattended. Before the doomed Flight 815 takes off, Shannon rummages through her hand luggage for her asthma inhaler, which Boone casually hands to her. Six hours into the flight, only moments before the crash, Shannon and Boone are momentarily seen as Charlie Pace stumbles through their row.\n\nUpon landing on the Island, she decides to join Sayid on a hike to transmit a distress signal, after she and Boone have an argument about her selfishness. When they discover a French looped signal already being transmitted, Shannon's knowledge of the language is used to translate it. Later, Shannon has an asthma attack, but her inhalers are nowhere to be found. Sun (Yunjin Kim) cures her, by using eucalyptus plants to help her breathing. Because of her selfish and manipulative behavior, Boone brands Shannon useless. Sayid enlists her to help translate the maps belonging to the French woman who made the radio transmission, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). Shannon and Sayid soon form a romantic relationship. After returning from a romantic night along the beach with Sayid, she learns Boone has died after falling from a great height. At his funeral, Shannon does not speak, but allows Sayid to talk instead. Shannon holds Locke (Terry O'Quinn) responsible for Boone's death, and asks Sayid to take action. When he refuses, she steals the key to the gun case from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and holds Locke at gunpoint in the jungle. When Rousseau arrives on the beach one morning to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival, Shannon prepares to migrate to the caves with the rest of the group. Before leaving on the raft the survivors have built, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) gives Shannon guardianship of his dog, Vincent, as a means to help her recover from her loss.\n\nAt the start of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt standing before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to it and they soon decide to sleep together for the first time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.\n\nDuring season six the afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown as an alternate timeline where the plane never crashed. Boone is seen on the plane traveling alone and explains he went to save Shannon from a bad relationship, but she did not want to come with him. In the series finale \"The End\" Boone is being attacked by someone outside a local bar, with Hurley and Sayid watching from afar. Shannon tries to defend him but is overpowered. Sayid gets out of the car and knocks the attacker unconscious. He gets down to help Shannon, and they remember their lives on the island and realize they are in the afterlife. Later that night she is reunited with the other passengers of Oceanic 815 and they all \"move on\" together.\n\nDuring the casting process, Shannon was compared to Paris Hilton, and \"Lost\" producer Damon Lindelof described her as a \"bitch. She is like a typical spoiled daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants and is not responsible to the slightest bit.\" Eirik Knutzen of \"The Repository\" found Shannon to be \"a self-centered twit,\" and she was also called a \"spoiled daddy's girl.\" Boone describes her as a \"self-centered little bitch.\" On her first night on the Island, Shannon is confident they will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends much of her time sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for \"using this poor guy like [she] use[s] everyone else.\" In \"Whatever the Case May Be,\" Boone says to Shannon, \"Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just – you're useless.\" This motivates her to help Sayid translate maps he obtained from Rousseau.\n\nThe producers were looking for someone who had a \"Paris Hilton quality\" to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be unlikable in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They came up with the idea for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is \"the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably.\" This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, \"What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field.\" This pairing made Shannon \"less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with.\" According to \"Lost\" producer Carlton Cuse, \"The relationships [the audience] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [the producers] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising.\"\n\nShannon's flashbacks in \"Abandoned\" were used to allow the audience to get to a \"really emotional level with the character, [to] finally understand ... why she was the way she was.\" Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to \"spin Sayid off in another direction.\" Damon Lindelof commented \"It's sort of understood on \"Lost\" that that's what you sign up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death.\" Lindelof felt an \"intense, emotional sense of loss\" when watching her death. In her post-death appearance in \"Collision,\" Maggie Grace was credited as \"special guest star.\" She received the same billing when she returned in season three, appearing in Nikki and Paulo's flashbacks. Carlton Cuse noted \"it was really fun for us to actually have Boone and Shannon reemerge in the stories.\" Shannon was originally in \"LA X\", the season premiere for the sixth and final season, but had to be written out as Grace was unavailable. The producers eventually arranged for Grace to appear in \"The End\".\n\nChris Carabott from IGN was critical of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting \"Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention.\" On their relationship he added, \"except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or anything that will ultimately be built upon in the \"Lost\" universe.\" In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented \"[Boone and Shannon] were both left with very little to do this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable.\" According to Melanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", Shannon is \"the least deserving of sympathy of all the previously known survivors.\"\n\nC. K. Sample, III, from AOL's TV Squad, joked, \"Boone's mother is the devil. How else to make us sympathize with Shannon right before killing her off of the show.\" Virginia Rohan of \"The Seattle Times\" thought the \"death of troubled Shannon, just as she was becoming more likable and had found love with Sayid, was sadder than the first-season death of her stepbrother, Boone. Still, it would grieve me far more to lose Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Sun or Jin.\" Maureen Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" felt fans echoed this view, describing their reaction as \"muted,\" as they were more angry at Ana Lucia for shooting Shannon. Maggie Grace co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for \"Best Ensemble - Drama Series. She was also nominated for the Teen Choice Award for \"Choice TV Breakout Performance - Female,\" but lost out to \"Desperate Housewives\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Eva Longoria.\n"}
{"id": "2231005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231005", "title": "Spinal manipulation", "text": "Spinal manipulation\n\nSpinal manipulation is an intervention performed on spinal articulations which are synovial joints, which is asserted to be therapeutic. These articulations in the spine that are amenable to spinal manipulative therapy include the z-joints, the atlanto-occipital, atlanto-axial, lumbosacral, sacroiliac, costotransverse and costovertebral joints. \nNational guidelines come to different conclusions with respect to spinal manipulation with some not recommending it, and others recommending a short course in those who do not improve with other treatments.\n\nA 2004 Cochrane review found that spinal manipulation was no more or less effective than other commonly used therapies such as pain medication, physical therapy, exercises, back school or the care given by a general practitioner. There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of spinal manipulations.\n\nA 2004 Cochrane review found that spinal manipulation (SM) was no more or less effective than other commonly used therapies such as pain medication, physical therapy, exercises, back school or the care given by a general practitioner. A 2010 systematic review found that most studies suggest SM achieves equal or superior improvement in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up. In 2007 the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society jointly recommended that clinicians consider spinal manipulation for patients who do not improve with self care options. Reviews published in 2008 and 2006 suggested that SM for low back pain was equally effective as other commonly used interventions. A 2007 literature synthesis found good evidence supporting SM and mobilization for low back pain. Of four systematic reviews published between 2000 and 2005, one recommended SM and three stated that there was insufficient evidence to make recommendations. A 2017 review concludes \"for patients with nonchronic, nonradicular LBP, available evidence does not support the use of spinal manipulation or exercise therapy in addition to standard medical therapy.\"\n\nFor neck pain, manipulation and mobilization produce similar changes, and manual therapy and exercise are more effective than other strategies. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review found that there is no high quality evidence assessing the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for treating neck pain. Moderate to low quality evidence suggests that multiple spinal manipulation sessions may provide improved pain relief and an improvement in function when compared to certain medications. Due to the potential risks associated with spinal manipulation, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical role of spinal manipulation. A 2007 systematic review reported that there is moderate- to high-quality evidence that subjects with chronic neck pain, not due to whiplash and without arm pain and headaches, show clinically important improvements from a course of spinal manipulation or mobilization. There is not enough evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is an effective long-term treatment for whiplash although there are short term benefits.\n\nThere was some evidence that spinal manipulation improved psychological outcomes compared with verbal interventions.\n\nAs for manipulation with the assistance of medication or anesthesia, a 2013 review concludes that the best evidence lacks coherence to support its use for chronic spine pain.\n\nThere is not sufficient data to establish the safety of spinal manipulations, and the rate of adverse events is unknown. Spinal manipulation is frequently associated with mild to moderate temporary adverse effects, and also rare serious outcomes which can result in permanent disability or death. The National Health Service in the UK notes that about half of people reported encountering adverse effects following spinal manipulation. Adverse events are increasingly reported in randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation but remain under-reported despite recommendations in the 2010 CONSORT guidelines. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review noted that more than half of the randomized controlled trials looking at the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for neck pain, did not include adverse effects in their reports. However, more recent reports have reported spinal manipulation adverse events to be rare.\n\nThe degree of serious risks associated with manipulation of the cervical spine is uncertain, with little evidence of risk of harm but also little evidence of safety either. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, which can lead to stroke and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it has been suggested that the relationship is causative, but this is disputed by many chiropractors who believe it is unproven.\n\nUnderstandably, vascular accidents are responsible for the major criticism of spinal manipulative therapy. However, it has been pointed out that \"critics of manipulative therapy emphasize the possibility of serious injury, especially at the brain stem, due to arterial trauma after cervical manipulation. It has required only the very rare reporting of these accidents to malign a therapeutic procedure that, in experienced hands, gives beneficial results with few adverse side effects\". In very rare instances, the manipulative adjustment to the cervical spine of a vulnerable patient becomes the final intrusive act which results in a very serious consequence.\n\nEdzard Ernst found that there is little evidence for efficacy and some evidence for adverse effects, and due to that, the procedure should be approached with caution, particularly forceful manipulation of the upper spine with rotation.\n\nA 2007 systematic-review found correlations of mild to moderate adverse effects and less frequently with cervical artery dissection, with unknown incidence.\n\nA 2016 systematic-review found the data supporting a correlation between neck manipulation and cervical artery dissection to be very weak and that there was no convincing evidence for causation.\n\nStatistics on the reliability of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Edzard Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, but none of the cases had been reported. He concluded that under-reporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates \"nonsensical.\" He therefore suggested that \"\"clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element.\"\" The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection. Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey method of data collection.\n\nA 2001 study in the journal \"Stroke\" found that vertebrobasilar accidents (VBAs) were five times more likely in those aged less than 45 years who had visited a chiropractor in the preceding week, compared to controls who had not visited a chiropractor. No significant associations were found for those over 45 years. The authors concluded: \"\"While our analysis is consistent with a positive association in young adults... The rarity of VBAs makes this association difficult to study despite high volumes of chiropractic treatment.\"\" The NHS notes that this study collected data objectively by using administrative data, involving less recall bias than survey studies, but the data were collected retrospectively and probably contained inaccuracies.\n\nStudies of stroke and manipulation do not always clearly identify what professional has performed the manipulation. In some cases this has led to confusion and improper placement of blame. In a 1995 study, chiropractic researcher Allan Terrett, DC, pointed to this problem:\n\nThis error was taken into account in a 1999 review of the scientific literature on the risks and benefits of manipulation of the cervical spine (MCS). Special care was taken, whenever possible, to correctly identify all the professions involved, as well as the type of manipulation responsible for any injuries and/or deaths. It analyzed 177 cases that were reported in 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997, and summarized:\n\nIn Figure 1 in the review, the types of injuries attributed to manipulation of the cervical spine are shown, and Figure 2 shows the type of practitioner involved in the resulting injury. For the purpose of comparison, the type of practitioner was adjusted according to the findings by Terrett.\n\nThe review concluded:\n\nSpinal manipulation is a therapeutic intervention that has roots in traditional medicine and has been used by various cultures, apparently for thousands of years. Hippocrates, the \"father of medicine\" used manipulative techniques, as did the ancient Egyptians and many other cultures. A modern re-emphasis on manipulative therapy occurred in the late 19th century in North America with the emergence of osteopathic and chiropractic medicine. Spinal manipulative therapy gained recognition by mainstream medicine during the 1960s.\n\nIn North America, it is most commonly performed by physical therapists, osteopathic physicians, occupational therapists, and chiropractors. In Europe, physiotherapists, osteopaths and chiropractors are the majority providers, although the precise figure varies between countries. In 1992, chiropractors were estimated to perform over 90% of all manipulative treatments given for low back pain treatment. A 2012 survey in the US found that 99% of the first-professional physical therapy programs that responded were teaching some form of thrust joint manipulation.\n\nManipulation is known by several other names. The British orthopedic surgeon A. S. Blundell Bankart used the term \"manipulation\" in his text \"Manipulative Surgery\". Chiropractors often refer to manipulation of a spinal joint as an 'adjustment'. Following the labeling system developed by Geoffery Maitland, manipulation is synonymous with Grade V mobilization. Because of its distinct biomechanics (see section below), the term high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust is often used interchangeably with manipulation.\n\nSpinal manipulation can be distinguished from other manual therapy interventions such as mobilization by its biomechanics, both kinetics and kinematics.\n\nUntil recently, force-time histories measured during spinal manipulation were described as consisting of three distinct phases: the preload (or prethrust) phase, the thrust phase, and the resolution phase. Evans and Breen added a fourth 'orientation' phase to describe the period during which the patient is oriented into the appropriate position in preparation for the prethrust phase.\n\nThe kinematics of a complete spinal motion segment, when one of its constituent spinal joints is manipulated, are much more complex than the kinematics that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral synovial joint. This may explain why studies have found that regional vs. targeted spinal manipulation result in similar patient outcomes.\n\nThe effects of spinal manipulation have been shown to include:\n\n\nCommon side effects of spinal manipulation are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231007", "title": "Doubly articulated consonant", "text": "Doubly articulated consonant\n\nDoubly articulated consonants are consonants with two simultaneous primary places of articulation of the same manner (both plosive, or both nasal, etc.). They are a subset of co-articulated consonants. They are to be distinguished from co-articulated consonants with secondary articulation; that is, a second articulation not of the same manner. An example of a doubly articulated consonant is the voiceless labial-velar plosive , which is a and a pronounced simultaneously. On the other hand, the voiceless labialized velar plosive has only a single stop articulation, velar (), with a simultaneous approximant-like rounding of the lips. In some dialects of Arabic, the voiceless velar fricative has a simultaneous uvular trill, but this is not considered double articulation either.\n\nThere are four independently controllable articulations that may double up in the same manner of articulation: labial, coronal, dorsal, and pharyngeal. (The glottis controls phonation, and works simultaneously with many consonants. It is not normally considered an articulator, and an ejective , with simultaneous closure of the velum and glottis, is not considered a doubly articulated consonant.)\n\nApproximant consonants, such as and , may be either doubly or secondarily articulated. For example, in English, is a labialized velar that could be transcribed as , but the Japanese is closer to a true labial–velar . However, it is normal practice to use the symbols and for the labialized approximants, and some linguists restrict the symbols to that usage.\n\nNo claims have ever been made for doubly articulated flaps or trills, such as a simultaneous alveolar–uvular trill, , and these are not expected to be found. Several claims \"have\" been made for doubly articulated fricatives or affricates, most notoriously a Swedish phoneme which has its own IPA symbol, . However, laboratory measurements have never succeeded in demonstrating simultaneous frication at two points of articulation, and such sounds turn out to be either secondary articulation, or a sequence of two non-simultaneous fricatives. (Despite its name, the \"voiceless labial-velar fricative\" is actually a voiceless approximant; the name is a historical remnant from before the distinction was made.) Such sounds can be made, with effort, but it is very difficult for a listener to discern them, and therefore they are not expected to be found as distinctive sounds in any language.\n\nClicks are sometimes said to be doubly articulated, as they involve a coronal (more rarely labial) forward articulation, which defines the various 'types' of clicks and the IPA letter assigned to them, plus a dorsal closure. However, this second, dorsal place of closure functions as part of the controlling mechanism of the lingual ingressive airstream used to generate the click. Thus, much as the glottal closure of ejectives (the airstream-generating mechanism of such consonants) is not considered to be a second place of articulation, clicks are not generally described as such either. Indeed, it is possible to have a true doubly articulated click, such as the labial-dental allophone, , of the bilabial click in Taa.\n\nThis leaves stops, and both oral and nasal doubly articulated stops are found. However, there is a great asymmetry in the places of their articulation. Of the six possible combinations of \"labial\", \"coronal\", \"dorsal\", and \"pharyngeal\", one is common, and the others vanishingly rare.\n\n\nThe Bantu languages Ila, Kafue Twa and Lundwe have been described as having labio-glottal and palato-glottal fricatives. See Ila language for a description.\n\nTriply articulated consonants are only attested as glottalized doubly articulated consonants, and this can be argued to be an effect of phonation or airstream mechanism rather than as a third articulation, just as other glottalized consonants are not considered to be doubly articulated. The most obvious case are the various types of glottalized clicks mentioned above. Another example is 'unreleased' final in Vietnamese, which after or is often labial-velar .\n\n"}

{"id": "2231012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231012", "title": "Walt Lloyd", "text": "Walt Lloyd\n\nWalter \"Walt\" Lloyd is a fictional character portrayed by Malcolm David Kelley in the American ABC television series \"Lost\". The series follows the lives of over forty survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Walt is introduced in the pilot episode as one of the survivors aboard the plane, which crashes onto the island where most of the program takes place. He is the 10-year-old son of Michael Dawson (played by Harold Perrineau).\n\nWalt appears in thirty episodes of \"Lost\"; 27 in seasons one and two as a series regular, and three more episodes as a guest star. He also features in the \"Lost\" epilogue \"The New Man in Charge\". Throughout the series, he is the only child main character. Initially, Walt and Michael have a dysfunctional father-son relationship, causing Walt to form friendships with other survivors, such as Locke and Sun. Walt leaves the island on a raft with Michael and two other survivors during the episode \"Exodus\", but is kidnapped by a group of hostile island inhabitants known as the Others. Walt is then released by the Others in the episode \"Live Together, Die Alone\", who claim that he was \"more than [they] could handle\", and he and Michael leave the island at the end of season two.\n\nWhen originally developed, \"Lost\" creators intended for Walt to display supernatural powers, such as the ability to summon animals through telepathy, but when Kelley had aged significantly for him to no longer convincingly look ten years old, the character's arc was changed and Walt was written out of the show. After auditioning many children for the part, Kelley was hired by the program's producers, who had been impressed by his performance in the 2002 film \"Antwone Fisher\".\n\nWalt is the 10-year-old son of Michael Dawson, a construction worker and part-time artist. He was born August 24, 1994, and is named after Michael's father, Walter. His mother is Susan Lloyd, a law student, who refused to marry Michael.\n\nWhen offered a job in Amsterdam, Susan persuades Michael to let her take Walt with her while he is still a baby. Two weeks before Walt's second birthday, Susan tells Michael that she and her boss, Brian Porter, are planning to get married and will be moving to Rome, Italy, at the end of the month. A legal battle ensues between Walt's parents. Several months later, they settle their dispute amicably and Michael lets Susan keep Walt with her.\n\nEight years later, Susan dies in Australia due to a \"blood disorder\". Brian pleads with Michael to take custody of the boy and even gives him tickets for the flight to Sydney and back, plus money for travel expenses. Brian reveals that he had never wanted to adopt Walt and that he is scared of him. When Michael arrives in Australia to collect Walt, he does not take too well to him. Michael spares Walt's feelings by telling him that Brian wants to keep him, but that it is up to Michael and he has decided to take him.\n\nSoon after the crash, Walt is left under the care of different people due to Michael's involvement in helping other survivors—in particular, Walt spends time with John Locke. He is intrigued by Locke's hunting instincts, and constantly tries to sneak away with him, always unsuccessfully. He sneaks away with Locke and Boone, and exhibits a natural talent in knife throwing. Michael soon arrives and is enraged, taking Walt away from them and forbidding him to see Locke again. Walt takes Vincent, the dog, and leaves camp, heading into the jungle, where he encounters a polar bear. He is rescued by Michael and Locke.\n\nMichael begins constructing a raft to leave the island, and finishes it after a few days. Walt secretly sets alight to it, completely destroying it. Later, Walt confesses to burning the original raft, explaining that he did not want to leave the island, but decides they need to leave. The next morning, Walt gives Vincent to Shannon before he leaves on the raft with Michael, Jin and Sawyer. That night, however, they encounter the Others, who kidnap Walt. Walt remains in captivity with the Others, but frequently appears to Shannon. In the mobisode \"Room 23\" it is revealed Walt posed a greater threat to the Others than they had expected, as he had been doing something unspecified that frightened them so that they would not go in to see him. Ben responds to a particular situation with a blaring alarm and people in commotion, and Juliet suggests that Ben take responsibility of the situation and bring Walt back to Michael.\n\nAs Michael is inspecting the technical equipment inside the hatch, he unexpectedly receives a message that he believes is from Walt. Michael is briefly reunited with Walt after he is brought to the Others' camp. Later, Michael returns with Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley, in an exchange for Walt and their freedom. Walt waits in a boat, and he and Michael sail off.\n\nWhile off the island, Walt learns that Michael killed Ana-Lucia and Libby and decided to live at his grandmother's house so as not to speak or have anything to do with his father.\n\nIn \"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\", Walt is shown to be living in New York City. He is visited by Locke, using a wheelchair at that point, having returned from the Island. Locke does not ask Walt to return to the Island as he does with the rest of the Oceanic returnees, as he felt that the boy had been through enough already. In \"There's No Place Like Home\", after being visited by Locke, Walt visits Hurley at the Santa Rosa Mental Institution with his grandmother. He asks Hurley why the Oceanic Six are lying and is told that they're lying to protect the people left behind on the island. Walt is under the assumption that his father is still alive and living on the island. In \"The End\", \"Lost\" final episode, neither Walt nor Michael feature among the main characters moving on to the afterlife. However, in the 12-minute epilogue to the series, \"The New Man in Charge\" (included on the DVD box set), Ben and Hurley visit Walt in the mental hospital that Hurley had previously been in. Ben promises Walt he can \"help his father,\" even though they both know Michael is dead. Hurley and Ben take Walt \"home\" to the Island, where Hurley promises him he will have a \"job\".\n\nWalt is a bit uneasy initially after being left with his father. He spends most of season 1 dodging his father and exploring the island with his dog, Vincent.\n\nMany children were seen for the role of Walt. They were narrowed down to a top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning the part after the producers were impressed with his role in the 2002 film \"Antwone Fisher\".\n\nWhen Kelley was originally cast, the character of Walt was a 10-year-old boy, but, after two seasons, Kelley no longer looked 10. While the first four seasons move slowly through time and only months have passed on the show, the actual filming stretched over several years. The show's writers dealt with this by sending Michael and Walt away from the island at the end of the second season. In his brief appearance at the end of season three, Kelley is noticeably taller and older with a deeper voice. This fact is acknowledged by Locke in \"Confirmed Dead\". In the season four episode, \"Meet Kevin Johnson\", Kelley makes a brief uncredited cameo as Walt in the episode's flashbacks. Make-up and CGI were used to make Kelley look younger and more like a 10-year-old. In the season four finale, \"There's No Place Like Home\", Walt appears in a flash-forward, but this scene is set about three years after the plane crash, so Kelley's older appearance is not a problem. When asked about the production difficulties associated with Walt and possible appearances of the character in the fourth season, co-creator Damon Lindelof stated: \"We've always known Malcolm was going to grow faster than we could shoot the show. And we planned for it. Trust us. Please trust us. You'll see [Walt] again. But you're gonna have to be patient. Sorry.\"\nWhen the \"Lost\" producers were developing the character of Walt, they initially intended for him to display supernatural powers by summoning animals—in the episode \"Special\", it is suggested that Walt is able both to cause a bird to fly into a window and make a polar bear attack him through telepathy. This is also alluded to in \"Live Together, Die Alone\", when Ben describes Walt as being \"more than [the Others] could handle\". Kelley himself was also under the impression that his character possessed \"magic powers\", but after he had aged significantly enough for him to look no longer ten years old, the writers' plans were changed, and Walt was written out at the end of season two.\n\nWalt returned to \"Lost\" in \"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\", when Locke visits him in New York. Kelley had stated a willingness to return to the show again,\nwhich was realized in \"The New Man in Charge\".\n\nWalt's only centric episode was the season one episode, \"Special\", which received positive reviews from critics. Chris Carabott of IGN described the relationship \"or lack thereof\" between Walt and his father as \"heart wrenching\". Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly stated that it was \"interesting\" to discover that \"Walt is 'different' and has special powers\". She also named the scene of Walt and Michael reading letters towards the end of the episode as \"one of [her favorites] of the entire season\".\n\nFor his performance as Walt, Kelley won the award for Best Supporting Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) at the 2006 Young Artist Awards. He had been nominated for the Leading Performance award in the same category the previous year. He also co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for \"Best Ensemble – Drama Series.\n\n"}

For most of the show's run, Hurley served as the show's comic relief, but occasionally, and most notably in the final season, he was shown in a more serious light. In the series finale, he takes over as the Island's protector from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) then takes Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) as his adviser, the same way Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) took Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). He was cited as an unlikely hero among the show's characters.\n\nHis storylines mostly involved his mental illness, his belief that his lottery win is a curse to those around him, his relationship to The Numbers, and his short-lived relationship with Libby (Cynthia Watros).\n\nHurley is Mexican-American and lives in Los Angeles with his mother (Lillian Hurst). His father left the family when he was a child, at which point Hurley began overeating. He was involved in an accident in which a deck collapsed as he stepped onto it, killing two people. Even though there were too many people on the deck prior to his arrival, Hurley feels great guilt because of his weight. He sinks into a depressive state, so his mother checks him into a psychiatric institution. There he creates an imaginary friend called Dave (Evan Handler) and meets Leonard Simms (Ron Bottitta), a patient who keeps mumbling the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Hurley's condition eventually improves; he leaves the institution and he resumes his job at a fast-food restaurant. He uses the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42 in the lottery, and wins a record jackpot of $114m. Hurley immediately begins experiencing bad luck: his grandfather Tito dies of a heart attack, the priest at Tito's funeral is struck by lightning, there is a fatal fire at a shoe factory he owns, the house he buys his mother burns down; his brother, Diego, is dumped by his girlfriend for a waitress; and Hurley is wrongfully arrested for being a drug dealer. As his net worth increases, so does his bad luck. Hurley suspects the numbers he used to win the lottery are cursed, so he visits the institution again to speak with Leonard. He tells Hurley the man who could explain the mystery of the numbers, Sam Toomey, lives in Australia. Before Hurley can travel to Australia, his father (Cheech Marin) returns to the family. He convinces Hurley to go to a psychic to cure his curse, but Hurley discovers his father has paid the psychic to lie. Once in Australia, Hurley visits Sam Toomey's wife (Jayne Taini), who reveals that Sam was driven to suicide to escape his constant bad luck. Halfway through the return flight to Los Angeles, the plane hits turbulence, splits in mid-air, and crashes on an island in the South Pacific.\n\nDuring the chaos post-crash, Hurley looks after Claire, a pregnant woman, at the request of Jack, a doctor. Hurley helps the group ration the remaining food and water from the plane; he slips Claire an extra ration for the baby. Hurley moves into the caves with some of the other survivors, where he discovers a pack of golf clubs and decides to create a golf course to ease the stress and tension of being stranded. When Claire claims to have been attacked one night, Hurley creates a census and discovers that Ethan, a fellow survivor, was never on the flight. When Hurley looks at the maps that Sayid recovered from Rousseau, Hurley discovers a sheet of paper containing the cursed numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42). He treks into the jungle in search of Rousseau, with Jack, Sayid and Charlie in pursuit. After being separated from the rest of the group, Hurley eventually encounters Rousseau, who reveals that the numbers brought her to the island, and agrees that they are cursed. That night, during a heart-to-heart, he tells Charlie about his wealth. Charlie does not take him seriously, and storms off. One morning, Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns the camp that the Others are coming. She then leads Hurley, Jack, Kate, Locke and Arzt to a wrecked slave ship called the \"Black Rock\", which contains some dynamite. After Arzt dies when dynamite he is holding explodes, Hurley blames himself and his bad luck.\n\nHurley is brought into the hatch the survivors have found, and is given the task of checking the food inventory, and brings Rose to help. Hurley, believing everyone will hate him, attempts to blow up the food with dynamite, but Rose manages to talk him out of it. Hurley decides to distribute the food freely, explaining there is no feasible way to ration it. Shortly after the arrival of the tail-section survivors, Hurley takes a liking to Libby and the two bond. However, Sawyer eventually discovers Hurley has secret food stash, and blackmails him into helping him track a tree frog that is annoying him. One morning, he and Libby go jogging together, where Hurley tells her about the food stash. The two of them destroy it together. At a cliff-top, his imaginary friend Dave convinces him that he is still at the institution in a coma and the only way to \"wake up\" is to jump off the cliff. Hurley is about to jump when Libby stops him and makes him see reason. The two kiss before returning to camp. He then plans a surprise picnic for her, but forgets to bring blankets. Libby offers to retrieve them from the Hatch; however, after collecting them she is shot and killed by Michael. When Hurley learns of Libby's shooting he rushes to her side. After speaking at Libby's funeral, he agrees to help Michael rescue his son from the Others, who he has blamed for Libby's shooting. After trekking across the jungle Jack exposes Michael as a traitor. Hurley confronts Michael, and later Jack, for bringing them along on a mission when he knew it to be a trap. Eventually, they are ambushed by the Others, who tie, gag and blindfold them before bringing them to a pier. Hurley is released and instructed to return to his camp and tell his people that they can never come to this part of the island.\n\nAs Hurley approaches the beach camp, he encounters Desmond, who mentions a speech by Locke about rescuing Jack, Kate and Sawyer. When Locke gives this speech later, Hurley suspects Desmond of being able to see the future, so he and Charlie devise a plan to draw the truth from him by getting him drunk. Later, Hurley discovers an old Dharma Initiative van. He, Sawyer, Jin and Charlie attempt to fix it, culminating in Sawyer and Jin pushing the van down a steep hill so Hurley can jumpstart it. Just as they are about to crash, Hurley defies his curse and miraculously starts the van. Later on, a cocky Sawyer bets against the camp that he can beat their best player in Ping Pong. Hurley defeats Sawyer, causing him to refrain from using nicknames for a week. Later, Hurley and Sawyer discover Nikki stumbling out of the jungle, then collapsing. He mistakes her for dead and finds Paulo in the jungle in the same situation. After failing to find a certain cause of death, Hurley gives them a funeral, but fails to notice Nikki open her eyes seconds before being buried. Hurley cons Sawyer into being decent to his fellow castaways as Hurley believes Sawyer to be the camp's new leader until Jack returns. The next day, Desmond asks Hurley to join him, Jin and Charlie on a hike. On their trek, they notice a parachutist bailing out of her helicopter, prompting them to head inland. They find Naomi hanging from a tree, and the four cut her loose. The four carry her back to the beach, where they hide her in Hurley's shelter. Later, Hurley and the others are shown Jack's plan to deter the Others from carrying out their kidnapping. Just as Charlie and Desmond set off to the , Hurley offers to join them, but his offer is declined. He instead accompanies Claire to the radio tower. As Sawyer and Juliet head back to the beach, Hurley again offers his services, but again his help is denied. Hurley heads for the van and drives it onto the beach, killing an Other, giving Sawyer and Juliet time to deal with the rest.\n\nHurley and Jack speak on the radio, and Jack tells Hurley they were successful and that rescue is imminent. However, Desmond returns to shore with news of Charlie's death, devastating Hurley. On the way to Jack, Hurley falls behind and runs after the group in a panic, only to find Jacob's mysterious cabin. Hurley sees inside and runs away, screaming for help, only to bump into Locke. Locke and Hurley agree that the freighter Jack called is not rescue and become determined to stop Jack. When the survivors are reunited, Locke suggests the group take refuge at The Others' village, an offer Jack refuses. The group divides, with Hurley following Locke. Hurley travels with Locke's group and quickly becomes disturbed by Locke's ideas and methods, especially when Locke takes freighter member Charlotte hostage. Once they reach the village, Hurley and Sawyer become roommates, which irks Sawyer. When playing RISK with Sawyer and Locke the phone alert rings, so he hides in Ben's house with everyone. Later Hurley follows Ben's instructions and flees the house with everyone else. Once Ben catches up to them, Locke and Sawyer argue over who is keeping Hurley when Sawyer decides he's going back to Jack and the beach. Hurley convinces them to stop arguing and goes with Locke and Ben to find Jacob. Afterward, Hurley follows Ben and Locke to the Orchid Station, where Ben and Locke must move the Island. Sawyer and Jack find him; Ben tells Jack and his companions to leave the Island. Hurley follows them to the helicopter, where Lapidus is waiting. Hurley, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Sayid, Sun, Aaron and Lapidus then fly off the Island, towards the freighter. Whilst in the air the island vanishes and the freighter explodes, forcing an emergency landing into a raft. Penelope Widmore's rescue boat rescues them, and Hurley, along with the rest of the Oceanic Six, move on to Sumba, where civilization awaits them.\n\nAfter leaving the island, Hurley and the other survivors are transported by cargo plane to a military base. Oceanic Airlines holds a press conference to tell the survivors' story in which they lie that there were no other survivors from the crash. Later he returns home to his mansion to find a surprise birthday party thrown by his parents. Hurley's father shows him his birthday present – Hurley's old Camaro. When he gets in the car, he notices that the mileage is set to the Numbers. This greatly disturbs Hurley, and he accuses his father of making a joke. His father denies it, but Hurley is so disturbed that he runs away. When Sun has her baby, Hurley arrives in Korea to congratulate her. Later, Hurley sees Charlie in a convenience store, he drives off, and leads the police on a long chase. Hurley is arrested and brought to the police station, where he looks onto the two-way mirror and sees Charlie drowning with the words \"THEY NEED YOU\" written in marker on his hand. The mirror breaks and water come pouring out, and Hurley screams for help. The police officer sarcastically suggests that he can put Hurley in a mental hospital, which Hurley quickly jumps at. Hurley then goes to Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute where he is approached by a man named Matthew Abbadon, who claims to be an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. He asks Hurley if he would like to transfer to a nicer place with an ocean view, but Hurley denies the offer, not wanting to ever see the ocean. Abbadon asks Hurley if anyone else is still alive. Hurley then freaks out and calls for a nurse. When Hurley goes to point him out, he has left the room. When Hurley is sitting on the grounds one day, he is approached by Charlie, who tells him that \"They need you.\" Later, Jack comes to see Hurley to check he will not reveal the truth about the plane crash. Hurley suggests that the Island wants them back, and that they should listen. Hurley's mental condition deteriorates, and his doctor contacts Jack, who comes and visits him. Hurley insists to Jack that none of them really made it off the island and that they are all dead and tells Jack that someone will be coming to visit him too. Later, Hurley is visited by Sayid who is intent on taking Hurley from the mental institution to some place safe.\n\nHurley is accompanied by Sayid after he is broken out of the mental institution and taken to an apartment building, only to discover there are dangerous men inside waiting for Sayid to enter. Sayid fights with them, but gets shot by a tranquilizer dart in the process. Hurley speeds down the road with an unconscious Sayid, but is pulled over. He then sees a vision of Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who informs him of how to avoid the police. He returns to his house and confesses to his parents what actually happened on the island. Hurley's father takes the unconscious Sayid to Jack and orders Jack to stay away from Hurley. While alone in his house, Hurley is approached by Ben Linus, who asks Hurley to come with him so they can go back to the island, to which Hurley declines. Hurley runs outside of his house, confessing to the murders that Sayid committed, and is arrested. Ben later has his lawyer get the charges dropped against Hurley, who is released from jail. Hurley leaves jail in a taxi, and rides along with Jacob who asks Hurley why he does not want to return to the Island. Jacob explains to Hurley that he is not cursed, and leaves a guitar case with Hurley. Hurley takes Jacob's advice and goes to LA X to leave on the flight with Sun, Jack, Sayid, Kate and Ben. During the flight, the plane encounters severe turbulence and a bright flash of light and disappears. Hurley finds himself on the Island's lake, where he is saved by Jack. The two then wake up Kate nearby and witnesses Jin, wearing a Dharma jumpsuit, pointing a rifle at them. Jin drives them to an open field where Sawyer explains to them that the year is 1977. Sawyer alters the recruitment records to allow Hurley, Jack, and Kate in as members; Hurley is assigned work as a chef. Jack and Daniel Faraday agree that dropping a hydrogen bomb will destroy the Island and prevent Oceanic Flight 815 from crashing in 2004. Hurley, Miles, and Jin then take Kate, Jack, Juliet, Sawyer, and Sayid to the construction site where the is being built. Hurley stays behind in their van to treat a wounded Sayid as the hydrogen bomb is detonated.\n\nAfter the detonation of the bomb, the survivors are transported forward to 2007, still on the Island. Jacob encounters Hurley again, telling him to take a dying Sayid to the Temple to save him. Once they arrive at the Temple, they are almost killed by the native inhabitants until Hurley claims that Jacob had sent them. To prove it, he shows the guitar case to the Others' leader Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), which contains an ankh with a scroll from Jacob in it. Later, Jacob's spirit again visits Hurley and instructs him to acquire Jack and walk to a lighthouse. Outside, Jacob reappears to Hurley, congratulating him on bringing Jack to the lighthouse as needed for Jack to realize that he is important to the Island. Jacob also divulges that he needed to get Jack and Hurley away from the Temple because \"someone bad\" was arriving there. The next morning Jack tells Hurley that they need to return to the Temple. Hurley stalls, until Richard Alpert, leads them to the ship \"The Black Rock\" and attempts to commit suicide using the dynamite. After this fails they head back to the beach where they meet Ben, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), Miles, Sun and Lapidus. The next day, he follows a still suicidal Richard into the jungle. He tells Richard that the spirit of Isabella, Richard's wife from 1867, had sent him. Hurley acts as an intermediary between the two, giving Richard the long-awaited opportunity to apologize to his wife. Richard tearfully thanks Hurley after Isabella's spirit leaves.\n\nLater, Richard decides to pack dynamite and explode the Ajira Airline to prevent the Man in Black from escaping. Hurley is initially on his side, but after Michael Dawson's spirit visits him and tells him he must prevent his plans, he tells Richard not to, or that they will all die. When Richard refuses, Hurley secretly walks to the \"Black Rock\" and defuses the remaining dynamite. An irate Richard splits their group up by taking Ben and Miles with him to look for other explosives, while Hurley, Jack, Sun, and Lapidus go to talk with the Man in Black. The whole group walks on to the Ajira plane, as the Man in Black claims that they will all leave on it. However, the Man in Black turns the group around after discovering explosives in the plane, insisting they take the submarine instead. The Man in Black tricks them by placing a bomb in Jack's bag, wanting to kill them all. Sayid grabs it and runs to the far end of the sub to sacrifice himself, despite Hurley's plea. The bomb explodes, and the sub begins to sink. Hurley, Kate, Jack, and Sawyer escape, but Jin and Sun drown. The four eventually arrive at a campfire where Jacob is waiting. Jack volunteers to take Jacob's place and be the next protector of the Island. Jack goes on to defeat the Man in Black, and takes Hurley and Ben with him to the heart of the island to return the light to the island. Jack knows this will kill him, so passes on his guardian role to Hurley. In tears, Hurley wonders what to do next, and asks Ben to be his adviser in protecting the Island. Ben gladly accepts the offer, and the two take up the post of guarding the Island. Hurley is last seen speaking to Walt in a Dharma van outside the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital about offering him a job when they return to the island.\n\nIn afterlife, Hurley describes himself as being the luckiest guy alive. He owns Mr. Cluck's Chicken franchise, and is well known for his philanthropy work. One day Hurley is eating at a Mexican restaurant and Libby sees him and sits next to him. She then tells him that she thinks that they are connected and could be soul mates. Dr. Brooks then comes over to the table and takes Libby back to Santa Rosa Mental Hospital. Later Hurley is eating at Mr. Cluck's and runs into Desmond, who advises Hurley to seek her if he believes she may be right. After making a generous donation to Santa Rosa, Hurley is allowed to see Libby again. Libby then tells Hurley that when she first saw him on one of his Mr. Cluck's Commercials, she had a vision of the Island, with him being in it, and both of them being in Santa Rosa together. Hurley thinks she is crazy, but invites her on a date anyway. On the beach, Hurley sets out a picnic for Libby. They kiss and Hurley also remembers his life on the Island, and assures Libby she isn't crazy. In the final scene outside of a church where the survivors of Oceanic 815 meet, Hurley has a brief exchange with Ben. In the exchange Hurley tells Benjamin that he was a \"real good number two,\" while Benjamin replies that Hurley was a great number one.\n\nJorge Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. In his audition to play Sawyer, the producers recognized him from an episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" which had aired the previous night. They thought he was spectacular, but didn't fit the role of Sawyer, so they created Hurley for him. In a flashback to his childhood in \"Tricia Tanaka is Dead,\" Hurley is played by Caden Waidyatilleka. Hurley appears in three : \"The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt\", \"Arzt and Crafts\", and \"Jin has a Temper Tantrum\".\n\nThe alternative rock band Weezer named their 2010 album \"Hurley\" after the character Hugo Reyes. The album's cover is a picture of actor Jorge Garcia.\n\nJorge Garcia guest starred on a season 6 episode of the CBS show \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"Blitzgiving\" which had references to \"Lost\". When Marshall asks for a random phone number, Jorge Garcia's character immediately shouts out the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Later Jorge's character says \"I feel like I was on that island for eternity\", referencing his curse. Both Hugo and Stephen, the character that Jorge Garcia plays on \"How I Met Your Mother\" are cursed. In Jeremy Garelick's comedy \"The Wedding Ringer\", Garcia portrays the character Lurch, who poses as one of Josh Gad's groomsmen. In the film's finale, the groomsmen are sat on a plane headed towards Tahiti for a weekend trip following the failed wedding. On the plane, Lurch claims, \"I've got a bad feeling about this flight\", a reference to \"Lost\".\n\nThe storyline involving Hurley's usage of the numbers 4 8 15 16 23 42 in a lottery has led to the sequence becoming a popular choice for lottery players. This issue came to particular attention when a record Mega Millions jackpot drawing on January 4, 2011 matched four of the six numbers (three plus the mega ball), resulting in several thousand people who played the numbers winning at least $150 each.\n"}
{"id": "2231014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231014", "title": "James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford", "text": "James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford\n\nJames Ford, better known by the alias \"Sawyer\" () and later as \"Jim LaFleur\", is a fictional character played by Josh Holloway on the ABC television series \"Lost\".\n\nSawyer was born on 18 February 1968; he was initially portrayed as a conniving, sarcastic handsome flirt who keeps stashes of washed-ashore items. His flashbacks typically depict a more sensitive side to him, juxtaposed against acts of betrayal and theft. He has a rivalry with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) for the affections of the fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Sawyer and Kate share a brief and tumultuous affair, but Kate's love for Jack prevails. Their relationship is particularly prominent in the beginning of the third season. In the fourth season he develops a more heroic side, becoming protective of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and sacrificing his chance to escape so his friends can in the season finale. In the fifth season, Sawyer quickly acclimates to his new role as group leader as they are sent back through time, and after being without Kate for three years, falls in love with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell).\n\nSawyer was born in Jasper, Alabama in 1968 as James Ford. When James was nine years old, his parents were conned by a man under the alias of \"Tom Sawyer\"; as a result, his father killed both his mother and himself. On the day of the funeral, Jacob expresses his condolences to Sawyer, even as he is writing his 'I am going to find you' letter for the conman who took his family. At the time of his parents' death, James and his family were living in Knoxville, Tennessee according to the letter Sawyer carries. James also claims to have dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but has a \"high school transcript.\" A major driving force in James' life is his vow to avenge his parents' deaths by hunting down the original Sawyer; as an adult, when he found himself in financial difficulty, he adopted the profession and alias of the man responsible for his parents' death, using his looks and charm to seduce wealthy married women, thus he \"became the man he was hunting.\" One of his scams involved waking up next to his victim and pretending to be late for an important meeting; as he rushes to get ready, his briefcase will \"accidentally\" spill open, revealing bundles of cash the woman \"wasn't supposed to see.\" With her interest piqued, he convinces her and her spouse to invest cash in a legally questionable, but supposedly lucrative business opportunity, before disappearing with the money. On one occasion, he runs this con up until he discovers the targeted couple has a child, experiences an attack of conscience and cancels the deal.\n\nOn another occasion, Sawyer carries out a \"Long con\" (large-scale con) on a divorced woman named Cassidy who is known to be less gullible than his usual victims. He sets up the usual con and spills his cash over the ground, only this time with fake bank notes. Cassidy realizes he's trying to con her from the moment he spills the money, and tells him his con wouldn't have worked because she received no money after the divorce. Instead of being mad, however, she asks him to teach her his profession. After learning a few basic tricks, Cassidy soon asks Sawyer to pull off a long con. He tells her such a con requires money, and she reveals she actually received $600,000 from her ex-husband. He pretends to begin a long con, using her money to set it up, but in fact he simply plans to take the money. However, she has begun to grow on him, and he wavers on his con. While visiting the diner of Kate's mother, his partner (played by Kevin Dunn) forces Sawyer to resume his con on threat of death. He goes back to Cassidy and tells her that he has been conning her, and warns her of a car parked outside. He stuffs the money into a bag and tells her to leave with it, and he will take the blame. When she runs off, he takes the real money (having given her fake bank notes) and returns to the car, actually empty.\n\nCassidy presses charges against Sawyer for conning her, and he is sent to prison. Cassidy visits him and informs him they have a daughter, named Clementine. While in prison, Sawyer befriends a man named Munson, sentenced for a white-collar crime. On behalf of the police, he cons Munson into revealing where he hid the money he stole; as a result, Sawyer's sentence is cut short, and the monetary reward he receives is deposited in an anonymous bank account for Clementine at his request. Later, as Sawyer is seducing another woman, another partner (played by Robert Patrick) informs him of the whereabouts of the original Sawyer who conned his parents. Sawyer travels to Australia to confront the man, and shoots him. Before he dies, Sawyer realizes his partner had conned him into killing someone who owed money to an important person. Sawyer also encounters and drinks with Christian Shephard at a bar. While in Australia, Sawyer is arrested, at the same station visited by Boone, for assaulting Warren Truss, an Australian politician and leader of the National Party, during a bar fight. As a result, Sawyer is deported and banned from returning to Australia; he leaves on board Oceanic Flight 815, his seat number being 15D.\n\nUpon crashing on the island, Sawyer almost instantly clashes with the other survivors. He initially accuses Sayid of being the terrorist who caused the crash. Despite this, he joins Sayid, along with Kate, Charlie, Boone and Shannon on a hike to send out a distress signal. Upon returning, Sawyer searches the plane wreck for anything and everything he can find and keeps them for himself, causing the other survivors to bargain with him for items. He and Jack clash over the attention of Kate on regular intervals. Kate claims to see through his attempts to make people hate him, until he shows her the letter he wrote but implies it was written to him by one of his victims; later she sees the date on the envelope and realizes he wrote the letter himself. After Jack is caught in a cave-in, Sawyer locates Kate in the jungle and eventually informs her. When Shannon experiences asthma attacks, Sawyer is immediately under suspicion of possessing her inhalers after Boone sees him with one of his belongings. After being interrogated by Sayid, he tells Kate that he doesn't have them, causing an enraged Sayid to stab him in the arm. Kate then confronts Sawyer regarding his selfish actions, and tells him to change his ways by cooperating more with the survivors. He reluctantly agrees.\n\nIn the jungle, Sawyer and Kate discover a case, carried on the plane by the marshal, and the two constantly fight over its ownership, until Jack takes it from Sawyer. Soon after, Sawyer becomes constantly harassed by a boar, and seeks Kate's help in finding it. Upon cornering it, however, Sawyer decides to let it go. After learning about Michael's plan to build a raft, Sawyer asks for a place on board, to which he is granted. However, after someone (later revealed as Walt) sets the raft on fire, Sawyer and Michael blame Jin and Sawyer takes him to the beach with the intent of beating him. Once the matter is solved, Sawyer experiences headaches and, after consulting Jack, is prescribed reading glasses, made from pairs found in the wreckage. His voice also calms the newborn of survivor Claire.\n\nThe day before the raft sets sail, Sawyer and Kate clash once more, this time over his place on the raft. While Kate placed a good argument, Sawyer revealed her past life as a criminal to the survivors, securing his space on the raft. The next day, Sawyer, Michael, Walt and Jin set sail on the raft. When a piece of the raft breaks off, Sawyer is the first in the water to retrieve and re-attach it. He also begins reading through the survivors' personal messages, kept in a bottle. That night, they encounter a small boat and begin celebrating their rescue. However, they soon reveal themselves as the Others, and demand they hand over Walt. In an attempt to prevent Walt's abduction, Sawyer is shot in the shoulder before the raft is destroyed by the Others, who leave with Walt.\n\nSawyer and Michael are stranded at sea with the wreckage of the raft. Sawyer removes the bullet from his shoulder prior to arriving back on the island, encountering the tail section survivors from the plane and being thrown into a pit. Once the mishap is cleared, Sawyer, Michael and Jin are released and forced into leading them to the fuselage camp. Throughout the journey, Sawyer constantly clashes with leader Ana Lucia, until he passes out from his bullet wound. He is then carried via hand-made stretcher until the death of Shannon, where he is carried by Mr. Eko into the hatch. He is cared for by Kate, until her father, Wayne, is channeled through Sawyer. Upon recovering, Sawyer reluctantly must seek Jack's medical expertise on a regular basis.\n\nOn one such occasion, Sawyer releases Jack and Locke from the armory after Michael locks them in to search for Walt alone. Sawyer agrees to join them as they follow, only to encounter the Others. After revealing to have Kate held hostage, Sawyer, Jack and Locke reluctantly hand over their guns for her safety. Unlike Jack, Sawyer sympathizes with Kate's actions. Soon after, Sawyer sets up a long con, with the help of Charlie, in order to gain possession of the camp's entire firearms and medicine, using Sun as a victim of a faked abduction attempt. Upon succeeding this feat, Sawyer is challenged by Jack to a game of poker with the medicine as the prize, which Jack wins. Sawyer later gives Sun a pregnancy test upon request, and informs Bernard and Jin about her suspected pregnancy.\n\nSawyer also uses his possession of the medicine to his advantage, and mocks Hurley when he admits to seeing things, only for his tirade to backfire. He also refuses to help Bernard create an S.O.S. sign on the beach. He is soon confronted by Ana Lucia, demanding he give her a gun. She seduces him, and steals his own gun from him. Upon discovering this, Sawyer, along with Jack, Locke and Kate, head for the hatch, where they discover Michael injured, Libby fatally wounded and Ana Lucia already dead. Michael asks Sawyer if he will go with him to the Others' camp, to which he agrees. After the funeral of Ana Lucia and Libby, Sawyer joins Michael, Jack, Kate and Hurley on the trek, where they are suddenly ambushed by the Others, tied up and taken to a pier. While Michael (along with Walt) leave the island, and Hurley is released, Sawyer is taken away by the Others, along with Jack and Kate.\n\nSawyer wakes in the Others' camp, imprisoned in a cage originally designed to hold polar bears. Karl, a teenager being held in the cage across from Sawyer's, helps Sawyer to figure out the mechanism in his cage so he can gain access to food and water. Karl then helps him to escape, but Juliet shoots Sawyer in the neck with a tranquilizer dart and he is returned to his cage. Karl is taken away, and Kate is placed in the cage vacated by Karl. Sawyer and Kate are forced to mine and haul rocks for the Others. During this manual labor, Sawyer kisses Kate, even though he gets beaten for it by Danny Pickett. Pickett, one of the Others, dislikes Sawyer, blaming him for the death of his wife.\n\nSawyer and Kate concoct an escape plan, but they are prevented from acting on it when Sawyer is knocked unconscious by Ben. The Others operate on Sawyer, implanting a pacemaker which will malfunction and kill him if his heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute. He is told if he does not cooperate, Kate will be given a pacemaker too. Because of this, Sawyer does not defend himself when Pickett violently beats him up.\n\nKate realizes she can slip out between top bars of her cage, but Sawyer refuses to escape with her. Instead of fleeing on her own, she returns to her cage. Later, Ben reveals to Sawyer that he has been conned, and there is no pacemaker in his heart. Ben informs Sawyer they are on a smaller island, separated by a stretch of open ocean from the island on which their plane crashed. Sawyer realizes how inescapable the island is, and is returned to his cage.\n\nKate opens Sawyer's cell but Sawyer again refused to leave, knowing how futile it would be to try. They have sex, and while Ben is unconscious, having a tumor removed by Jack, Pickett takes the opportunity to finally kill Sawyer. However, Jack threatens to let Ben die unless Kate and Sawyer are released. Sawyer turns the tables on Pickett, beats him up, and he and Kate escape. Alex Rousseau helps them hide in the jungle in return for freeing Karl (her boyfriend), and gives them a canoe to escape in. Right before they leave the beach, Pickett finally catches up with them, but is shot dead by Juliet, who Ben ordered to help them escape.\n\nBack on the main island, Sawyer and Kate argue over his decision to leave Jack behind (and also to let Karl go free). At the survivors' camp, Sawyer keeps his distance from Kate and helps Hurley, Jin, and Charlie in repairing an abandoned Dharma truck Hurley found in the jungle. Back at the camp, he discovers Kate has gone off with Sayid and Locke in order to rescue Jack. He and Hurley develop a friendship, often playing table tennis together. Hurley surprises Sawyer by announcing with Jack, Locke, Kate, and Sayid gone, the rest of the survivors are looking to Sawyer to lead them. Sawyer rises to the challenge and bonds with the other survivors. When Kate and Jack finally return, Sawyer is outraged they have brought Juliet along. He and Sayid attempt to get information on the Others out of her, but they ultimately fail.\n\nSawyer resumes his relationship with Kate but suspects she is using him to make Jack jealous. One night Locke tells Sawyer that he has captured Ben, and takes Sawyer to the \"Black Rock\", locking him in a room with a bound and gagged stranger. This man, not Ben, reveals he is Anthony Cooper (Locke's father), a conman who reveals he went by name \"Tom Sawyer.\" Sawyer realizes this is the man whom he has been searching for. After Cooper mocks his letter of vengeance, Sawyer strangles him to death in a fit of anger. With no more use for the nickname \"Sawyer,\" he begins to call himself James again, though others continue to refer to him as Sawyer. Locke presents him with a tape showing Juliet is still working for Ben, and the Others are preparing a raid on the survivors. When Sawyer shows the tape to Jack at their camp, Jack reveals he knows about the raid, and Juliet has been working with him to double-cross the Others.\n\nSawyer and several survivors hike across the jungle to the radio tower. Sayid, Jin, and Bernard stay behind to thwart the Others, and end up captured. Sawyer decides to go back with Juliet to rescue them. With the help of Hurley and the Dharma truck, their rescue is a complete success. Two of the Others are killed and the third, Tom, is captured before Sawyer shoots him out of vengeance for 'taking the kid off the raft.'\n\nWhen Desmond breaks the news about Charlie's death, Sawyer attempts to comfort Hurley, though his efforts are rejected. Although originally unsure of the meaning of Charlie's dying message, \"Not Penny's Boat,\" when the survivors split Sawyer chooses to go with Locke to the Barracks, telling Kate he was simply doing what he's always done: surviving. While holding Kate hostage in Ben's house on Locke's orders, Sawyer tells Kate he doesn't wish to return to the real world, seeing as he has nothing for him back there. He then proceeds to tell Kate she should do the same, and that they could try to start a life on the island. Kate leaves after Sawyer is relieved that she isn't pregnant, reasoning that they wouldn't be able to handle a baby. They have an argument and part on bad terms as Kate returns to the beach. Later on, a group of people from the boat arrive at the barracks to capture Ben. Ben, Locke, Hurley and Aaron take refuge in Ben's house and they barricade the door. Sawyer runs to retrieve Claire who is still sleeping alone in her house and watches in horror as it is blown up by the Freighters. He finds Claire alive under the ruins and proceeds to run back to Ben's house. After Alex is murdered by Keamy and Ben unleashes the smoke monster on the attackers, Sawyer decides to go back to Jack and the others on the beach. Claire, Aaron and Miles go with him. Hurley was going to go with Sawyer as well, but Locke, pointing a gun at Sawyer, forces Hugo to stay with him. After Sawyer warns Locke not to hurt \"a single hair on his [Hugo's] curly head,\" he leads the rest of the group back to the beach.\n\nSawyer, Claire and Miles soon come across the bodies of Danielle and Karl. After leaving the area, they decide to settle down to make camp, however during the night Claire takes off into the jungle. Sawyer wakes up the following morning and Miles tells him Claire walked into the jungle in the middle of the night with someone she called \"Dad\". A short while later he hears Aaron crying and runs off to find him alone in the jungle. Sawyer and Miles, along with Aaron, continue on where they meet Jack and Kate in a small field. Jack and Kate were in the process of moving towards the helicopter from the freighter, with Jack inadvertently thinking the dropped satellite phone from Frank was a message to follow the crew. Sawyer then informs Jack and Kate that Claire walked off and the freighter's crew are up to no good. He hands Aaron over to Kate and tells her to go back to the beach with Miles and the infant, while he insists on going with Jack to face Charles Widmore's men. The two then find the helicopter, discover Frank handcuffed to the seats, and are told the men are heading towards Ben. Sawyer then tells Jack that Hurley is with Ben and the two head off to rescue Hurley.\n\nJack and Sawyer eventually find Hurley and Locke at the . After Jack finishes talking with Locke, Sawyer and Hurley meet up with Kate, Sayid, and Frank at the helicopter. En route to the freighter Frank notices that the helicopter is quickly losing fuel due to a bullet hole in the gas tank. The passengers ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load, but Frank declares it will not be enough. Sawyer whispers something to Kate, he gives her a goodbye kiss, and he then bails out of the helicopter to give the others a chance of escape. Sawyer swims back to the Island and encounters Juliet, who directs his attention to smoke coming from the ruins of the freighter. As the two lie on the beach drinking rum they disappear with the vanished Island.\n\nAfter the Oceanic Six (Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun, Sayid and Aaron) leave the Island, flashforwards in \"Something Nice Back Home\" reveal Kate is doing undisclosed favors for Sawyer, who, according to Jack, \"chose to stay on the island\".\n\nBefore the strange flash, James and Juliet meet up with Charlotte, Miles, Rose, Bernard and the other 815 survivors and they discover their camp is somehow missing. James is then introduced to Daniel Faraday, who tells him the camps are not gone but that it hasn't been built yet and whatever Ben did in the Orchid station has made them constantly shift through time. They are in the past. The group set out to find a man-made landmark on the Island to determine where they are in time. After several more flashes, the team decide to head back to the beach. At the beach, they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows, resulting in several casualties. The group ultimately splits up, with James and Juliet heading toward the creek together. There they are attacked by three strangers. They demand answers, and even threatens to cut off Juliet's hand to emphasize their impatience, when Locke arrives to kill one and injure the other two. James, Juliet, and Locke question the two attackers and Juliet discover they are Others when they speak Latin to each other. They arrive at a camp where Richard Alpert is leading his people and he has Charlotte, Daniel and Miles held captive. The year is 1954. When an Other called Ellie takes Daniel at gunpoint to try to disarm a hydrogen bomb called Jughead, James holds a gun at her in order to rescue him. He then discovers Daniel had told Ellie they are from the future and are not part of the American military which the Others had believed they were. Suddenly, there is yet another flash and the Others including Ellie and Richard disappear. James and the rest see Charlotte bleed from her nose and collapse.\n\nJames watches as Juliet and Daniel attempt to wake up Charlotte, who eventually comes around. James and Locke decide to head to the Orchid Station, believing a way to stop the jumps is there. When they return to the beach they discover the camp is back but has been abandoned and they also find a rowing boat on which they decide to use to get to the Orchid. However whilst rowing they are attacked by unknown assailants from behind – Juliet manages to shoot one of the attackers but before anything else can happen there is another flash. The assailants are gone, and they are rowing in the rain. Later on, the team is reunited with Jin, last seen in the season four finale, who is alive. Along with Jin the team then continue on to Orchid where the flashes become worse and becomes painful for all the castaways, and not just Charlotte. They arrive, but a flash moves the island to a point before the Orchid was built. With the guidance of Charlotte, who collapsed earlier due to a deteriorating mental state and stay behind with Daniel, they find a well which leads to the Frozen Donkey Wheel. As Locke lowers himself into the well, another flash engulfs the Island. This causes all parts of the well, except the rope James grabbed on, to disappear. In a frenzy, James starts digging at the ground where the rope is, but Juliet stops James, and tells him Locke is gone.\n\nLocke then goes into a cave and turns the crank, which Ben originally turned, and the island stops moving through time. James, Juliet, Miles and Jin head back to Daniel, who informs them Charlotte has died due to violent shifts through time. As they all head back to the beach they hear the sound of gunshots and a woman screaming. Approaching the source of the commotion they see two men holding a woman hostage with a bag over her head after just killing her male companion. James and Juliet aim their guns at the men and tell them to stand down but when one of the men takes a shot at James both he and Juliet kill the men in self-defense. James releases the woman, who introduces herself as Amy. She tells them they need to bury the men they killed and to take her husband's body back to her people in order to keep a truce. As the team and the woman called Amy trudge back, they approach a sonic fence. Amy appears to turn off the machine and walk through it without being harmed. However James, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Jin walk through and are all knocked unconscious. Amy is revealed to be wearing earplugs.\n\nJames later wakes up in a house on a couch. A man named Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) demands to know who he and his friends are. Having previously experience with lying, he tells Horace his name is Jim LaFleur and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island while on its way to Tahiti. Horace, believing his story, tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that James and his friends must be on it. James asks if he could search for his \"other friends,\" but his plea is denied. It appears Horace and Amy are part of the DHARMA Initiative. Later that night, Richard Alpert enters the Barracks, DHARMA's homes, to demand where his two men, the ones James and Juliet killed, are buried. James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to Richard alone. He explains to Richard he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with John Locke, who had met Richard a few years prior during an earlier flash. He gives the flustered Richard information able to fully convince the latter. James also tells Richard that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense; Richard however tells him his people are livid and want some justice; Amy agrees to give Richard the body of Paul, her husband, in order to keep the truce. The agreement is made; Richard leaves. It appears the present time is 1974, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative's presence on the Island. Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce, stating they must respect their own privacy on the Island. A relieved and obliged Horace kindly informs James he and his fellow survivors can stay on the Island for two more weeks in order to search for his friends (Locke), before boarding the next submarine off the Island. James and Juliet share a quiet moment at the dock, the latter telling the former her longing to leave the Island is at its peak. She wants to leave on the next submarine, but James reminds her she has nothing to go back to, since they are thirty years back. Juliet consents to staying.\n\nThree years pass, and James is still on the Island along with his friends. They are all working for DHARMA, and for the most part they are contented living at the Barracks, especially James, who shares a home with Juliet. He is the head of security and an apparently trustworthy figure, using his alias \"Jim LaFleur.\" One morning, he receives a call from Jin regarding the return of Jack, Kate, and Hurley, having returned to the Island and to the past. Stunned, he goes out to meet them at a grassy field far from the Barracks, and there he tells them of his position within DHARMA and the present time of 1977. Kate's return makes him realize that despite being apart for 3 years and having fallen for Juliet, he is still has feelings for Kate, and becomes torn between her and Juliet. In order to smuggle them into DHARMA, Sawyer instructs the three to dress up in appropriate clothing and pretend to be new recruits for DHARMA so as to avoid awkward questions and the Hostiles, DHARMA's name of choice for the Others. Later Sayid, (last seen in 316), who also traveled back in time, is caught in the jungle and is mistaken by DHARMA as a Hostile. James is pressured to execute him for violating the code of truce between DHARMA and the Hostiles, but he has him locked in a cell and quietly contemplates a plan to free him.\n\nSayid escapes a few days later with the help of eleven-year-old Ben. After the former shoots the latter and runs off, Jin carries the boy back to the Barracks, where he is treated with minimal success at the infirmary. James alerts Jack and pleads him to help, but his request is snubbed. Eventually, James and Kate take the unconscious boy to the Others, believing they can provide the only cure. After doing so, with the caveat Ben will never be the same again, James asks Miles through the surveillance camera at the border between DHARMA's area and the Others' territory to remove the tape containing footage of Ben being taken away. The two return to the Barracks afterward. James is alerted of Roger Linus's, Ben's father, suspicions, and begins to worry about what may come next. Security staff member Phil (Patrick Fischler) confronts James and shows him the tape mentioned earlier, this proving Miles failed James' order. James knocks him out in response and keeps him tied up and gagged in the closet. The next day, he holds a meeting with only the Oceanic Six survivors and Juliet and reluctantly tells them his comfortable life within DHARMA is ending, thanks to Jack, Kate, and Hurley. He wants to return the beach and start over. However, following the events in The Variable, Radzinsky, an antagonistic engineer of DHARMA's, discovers Phil in the closet and ties up James and Juliet in two chairs, furiously demanding answers. James refuses to comply, forcing Radzinsky to violently beat him, even with Horace pleading him not to. When Dr. Pierre Chang (Francois Chau) disrupts the interrogation to order everyone to leave the Island because of impending danger, James requests the women and children get on the submarine and leave. He also agrees to tell everyone everything on the condition he and Juliet also get spots on the sub. An agreement is made; they get on board, James hoping never to turn back. Unfortunately, Kate also gets on, informing him and Juliet of Jack's intentions to detonate a hydrogen bomb which will decimate the Island and alter the past so Oceanic 815 will never crash twenty-seven years from now. Very reluctantly, James agrees to help stop Jack, and the three secretly leave the sub and head back to the beach. After briefly meeting up with Rose and Bernard (last seen in The Lie) and leaving them, they confront Jack, Hurley, Sayid, Jin, and Miles. James drags Jack to a secluded area and tells him that he, James, could have stopped Anthony Cooper from conning his parents and thus preventing their deaths a year ago, but asserts what is done is done, and Jack should do the same in his case. When Jack rebuffs, they get into a fistfight which continued until Juliet intervenes. Much to James' vexation, Juliet agrees with Jack. Juliet tells James she will never lose him if she does not know him.\n\nAs Jack prepares to go to the constructing Swan Station to drop the bomb on the electromagnetic source, Phil and his men spot him and try to shoot him down. James, Juliet, Kate, and Miles come to Jack's aid, and an intense gunfight ensues. DHARMA's men are besieged, and James urges Jack to go ahead and discharge the bomb. However, the bomb does not go off, and the electromagnetic source is activated, causing pandemonium. Phil nearly kills James, but is stabbed dead by a rebar in the process. Amidst the chaos, James spots Juliet falling in the chasm and in danger of getting sucked in. He and Kate grasp her hands and he tells her to not to leave him, but the force becomes too strong, causing pain for all of them. Juliet tells James she loves him and releases her clutch, dropping down to the bottom where she cannot be seen. James sobs hysterically, not registering himself, even when Kate and Jack drag him back up.\n\nIn the premiere of season 6, James wakes up in the middle of the jungle and finds out he and the rest of the group traveled back to 2007. They discover the Swan imploded, just like they left it in 2004. James realizes the plan didn't work and Juliet died for no reason, and he beats Jack. They all fall into the hole where the hatch door was supposed to be, and Kate suddenly hears moaning coming from underneath the steel, which leads her to believe Juliet may still be alive. After removing all the pieces of metal, James climbs down and finds a heavily bleeding Juliet. She asks him to kiss her, and after doing so, Juliet dies in his arms. James buries her with Miles' help, but really wants him to implement his medium skills to find out what Juliet's dying words were supposed to be. Miles says Juliet told him \"it worked,\" to which James pouts. Later, he and Miles are captured by the Others, but not before taking down several of them as Miles proclaimed. They are taken to the Temple, the Others' vicinity and only safe location from the Smoke Monster. In his anger over Juliet's death, he tells the Others to do whatever they want with his friends, whom he proclaims are no longer his friends to this point, and leaves. Kate goes after him, following him back to the Barracks and what used to be his and Juliet's house. When James and Kate sit on the docks, he confesses he planned on asking Juliet to marry him, having a ring and all. He admits to Kate he should have let Juliet leave with the sub when she asked him to, back in 1974, but made her stay because he didn't want to be alone. He also tells Kate he doesn't blame her for Juliet's death. He throws the ring in the ocean and then leaves, telling Kate that he will not help her on her mission to find Claire.\n\nHe spends his time playing loud music from his record player and drinking. When the Smoke Monster shows up, in the form of Locke, James is not entirely surprised about it, but suspects he is not Locke, judging by the way he talks. The Man in Black persuades him to follow him to a part of the Island to answer the most important question of all: \"Why is (James) on the Island?\" They then head off; James spots a boy in the jungle and the Man in Black is perturbed to know he can see him too. While the Man in Black runs after the mysterious boy, James meets Richard, who frantically asks him to come along to the Temple. James refuses, and Richard, hearing the Man in Black coming back, runs off. They climb down a cliff to a cave. James sees a scale with a black stone and a white stone, the Man in Black throwing into the sea the latter. The Man in Black then shows James mysterious carvings on the cave ceiling; among them are the surnames of John, Hurley, James (himself), Sayid, Jack, and Sun. The Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 correspond to a surname, for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively. James is informed Jacob picked and manipulated those people at various points in their lives to have them show up on the Island. James is a candidate to take up the mantle of leader of the Island; thus, he is given three choices: do nothing, become leader of the Island, or leave the Island with the Man in Black. James firmly chooses the third choice.\n\nHe follows the Man in Black to Claire's camp, Claire being a follower of the former. James agrees with Jin he will help look for Sun. The Man in Black then sends him to the other Island, dubbed \"Hydra Island\" to look for survivors of the Ajira Airways Flight 316. Arriving there, James greets Zoey (Sheila Kelley), who tells him she is the remaining survivor. However, James learns she is lying and demands answers, until a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who has returned on a submarine. James makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. He travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating he is loyal to the Man in Black. However, he later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted.\n\nWhen the Man in Black leaves to recruit Sun, James tries to stop Jin from leaving camp, until a barrage of tranquilizers bring them down. Jin is taken away by Widmore's team, who has been spying on them, and James tries to remain calm as the situation reaches higher levels of strain.\n\nIn the series finale, James escapes the island on an airplane piloted by Frank Lapidus, along with Kate Austen, Claire Littleton, Richard Alpert and Miles Straume.\n\nAfter James' untold death at a later date, he appears in the alternate timeline in 2004. James is on the plane along with the rest of the passengers and has a conversation with Hurley. He somewhat flirts with Kate, a fugitive again, escorted by Edward Mars. Later on, after the plane lands, James and Kate share an elevator at the airport, him noticing the handcuffs around her wrists and realizing her criminal status. When security guards enter the elevator, James helps Kate escape them, knowing she's on the run.\n\nAs it turns out, James is actually a policeman from the LAPD. His partner is Miles. However, his back story involving his parents' death at the hands of Anthony Cooper remains unchanged (as shown in his blind date with Charlotte Lewis), and he is adamant on hunting Cooper down and killing him. He had traveled to Australia to look for him, under the pretense he went to Palm Springs, as he had told Miles. However, Miles finds out the truth and threatens to sever their partnership unless James tells him about the trip to Australia. Later, in his car James tells Miles everything, including his yearn to kill Cooper. Miles objects, but before James can respond, a car crashes into his and its driver runs off. The two cops pursue, and James apprehends the driver, Kate.\n\nAlong with Kate, James and Miles arrest Sayid, their only suspect in the killing of Martin Keamy and his men. Sun was shot during the battle and was included in the report. After Desmond runs over Locke with his car and attacks Ben, he turns himself in to James. The three (Sayid, Kate and Desmond) are then told they are being transported to County Prison. Before the concert begins in the final episode, The End, Miles sees Sayid in the passenger seat of Hurley's car. He notifies James, who then believes Sayid is after Sun, at the hospital. When James arrives, Sun and Jin are preparing to leave. He notifies them of the possibility of Sun being Sayid's target but they both re-assure him she is safe. Before they leave the hospital room, Jin tells James, \"We'll see you there\", which leaves him confused. He leaves the room shortly after and bumps into Jack asking him if he knows where to get some food around here. Jack tells him the cafeteria is closed but there are vending machines at the end of the corridor to which he responds, \"thanks Doc\". A connection was seen between the two but nothing played out. The candy he chooses gets stuck so he tries to reach it using the tray at the bottom. Juliet arrives at the same moment and gives her advice to unplug the machine and the candy will fall. While unplugging the machine, there is a short and the entire room's electricity goes off. Juliet then tells him it worked and while handing him the candy, they both flash. They begin to recall the last few words they said to each other about getting coffee, and they touch again, which allows them to remember what occurred. They embrace, hug, and kiss and are later seen at the church with the other main characters. James and Juliet move on to the next phase of the afterlife together, as soulmates.\n\nSawyer is not initially liked by the other survivors due to his narcissistic personality, rude attitude, and his habit of calling everyone by offensive nicknames. He keeps a stash of such items as Whiskey and pornography, which he had stolen from the wreckage. He is manipulative of his fellow survivors. it is revealed after the kiss that he never had the medication in the first place. It is also hard for him to work with other people, a quality essential for surviving on the island, and is quoted saying \"every man for himself\" when he is expected to help Jack escape from The Others in season three. However, he grows more mature and caring in the later seasons, mostly because of his love for Kate, and, later, his own leadership role on the island and his relationship with Juliet. He shows his emotional side occasionally in the earlier seasons, too, especially in the flashbacks. He is very often depicted reading books, a habit that contrasts with his \"redneck\" side.\n\nSawyer was originally a slick conman who wore a Prada suit. Midway through his audition for the role, Josh Holloway forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration. He managed to remember his lines after this and finished reading the monologue. The producers knew he didn't suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, and kept the same intelligence he originally had. Matthew Fox, Jorge Garcia and Dominic Monaghan read Sawyer's lines when they came in to audition because there was no existing script for their characters. Damon Lindelof has stated that Sawyer was written as a character whom audiences were supposed to care about even if his behavior was not sympathetic – \"He's an asshole, but he acts as an asshole because of the horrible things that happened to him as a kid\". The character flashbacks would try to follow the same spirit of the character, \"a humorously engaging rascal — but who did have this sort of darkness to him\", while showing what made Sawyer \"a man who's hell-bent on revenge, like an Ahab model.\"\n"}

On August 22 the company was rebaptized Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, in homage to the killer whales that roam on the British Columbia coast. In 1996, McCaw assumed full ownership of the company and its assets.\n\nCiting mounting losses, on August 21, 1999, Orca Bay announced that the Grizzlies, Canucks and GM Place were up for sale. The Grizzlies were purchased for $160 million in 2000 by Chicago businessman Michael Heisley, who after another losing season relocated the team to Tennessee in 2001, where it became the Memphis Grizzlies. While for three years Orca Bay considered selling the Canucks to North American investors, by 2003 the team's improved performances had the company give up on this. In November 2004, Vancouver-based investment company the Aquilini Investment Group purchased 50% of the company from McCaw and two years later bought the remaining 50%. On 2008, AIG rechristened the company Canucks Sports & Entertainment feeling the team's brand was strong enough for its parent company.\n\nIt was reported on May 11, 2009 by local radio station the TEAM 1040 that Francesco Aquilini and Canucks Sports & Entertainment had expressed interest in purchasing the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association and moving the team to Vancouver. A possible deal would depend on if Pacers owners Herbert and Melvin Simon can secure a new lease agreement with the Indianapolis Capital Improvement Board who own their home arena, the Conseco Fieldhouse (now Bankers Life Fieldhouse). In 2011, rumours surfaced of Aquilini wanting to purchase the then-New Orleans Hornets; however, the Hornets, since renamed the Pelicans, were sold to Tom Benson, owner of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints, in April 2012.\n\nIn June 2018, Canucks Sports and Entertainment purchased the Vancouver Stealth of the National Lacrosse League. The team was rebranded as the Vancouver Warriors and relocated from the Vancouver suburb of Langley, British Columbia to Rogers Arena in Vancouver. Canucks Sports and Entertainment became the fifth NHL owner to purchase an NLL franchise.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231017", "title": "Jin-Soo Kwon", "text": "Jin-Soo Kwon\n\nJin-Soo Kwon, better known as \"Jin,\" is a fictional character on the ABC television series \"Lost\" played by Daniel Dae Kim.\n\nJin-Soo Kwon was born on 27 November 1974 in Namhae, South Korea to a poor fisherman and a prostitute, the latter of which abandoned Jin and his father during his infancy. Jin had since been told that his mother died when he was young. Even though he was not sure about being Jin's father, the fisherman raised Jin, knowing that no one else would. As an adult, Jin attempted to follow his dreams of owning his own restaurant and hotel, and applied for a job at Seoul Gateway Hotel. Jin's heritage is recognized by the owner who employs him as a doorman, under strict instructions to keep \"people like him\" out of the hotel. When Jin allowed a disheveled man's son to use the hotel toilets, the owner rebuked him, prompting Jin to quit on the spot. Shortly after leaving, Jin literally bumped into Sun Paik (Yunjin Kim). After finding work as a waiter elsewhere, Jin visited Sun's father to ask for her hand in marriage. Jin disowned his heritage in order to gain Mr. Paik's respect, and in doing so was given a job as a floor manager in one of his factories. Sun and Jin were wed, and at their wedding reception, unknowingly spoke with Jacob, who congratulated them and told them (in fluent Korean, to the amusement of the couple) to never take each other, or their love, for granted. Two months after marrying Sun, Jin was assigned to present an associate with a stuffed panda to congratulate a newborn, a task in which Jin was faced with various obstructions. Later Jin was promoted to working as an \"enforcer\" for Mr. Paik, who had no qualms about the use of bribery, blackmail, extortion, and murder to succeed.\n\nWhile Jin was unaware as to the reason of his sudden promotion, it put a strain on his relationship with Sun. Jin's first assignment was to \"convince\" a government official to overlook the violating environmental regulations caused by one of Paik's factories. Jin gave the official's puppy to Sun as a gift, but on the second visit, Jin violently beat him to prevent a hitman from killing him. Jin returned home covered in blood, but refrained from telling Sun about the work her father ordered him to do. Despite their problems, Jin and Sun tried to conceive children. However; after a visit with a fertility doctor, Jin grew angry upon learning that Sun could not conceive, and accused her of knowing all along. The doctor later admitted to Sun that the opposite was true, that Jin was the one who was sterile. The doctor was afraid to reveal this to Jin for fear of retribution, as he knew of Jin's work for Mr. Paik. Later, Paik ordered Jin to kill Jae Lee, though he did not reveal to Jin the reason (he was having an affair with Sun). Following orders, Jin confronted Jae Lee at his hotel room and violently beat him. Instead of killing him; however, Jin told him to leave the country and never return. Upon returning to his car, Jin was startled when Jae Lee landed on his car after jumping from his hotel room as a supposed act of suicide.\nLater, Jin was assigned on a secret mission to deliver watches to two of Mr. Paik's associates in Sydney and Los Angeles. Jin took Sun with him, telling her that it was a vacation. Before leaving Korea, Jin visited his estranged father, much to his delight. Jin told his father about the turmoil that had plagued his life since being employed by Mr. Paik. Jin's father told him to remain in the United States upon arrival and never return. Jin decided to follow through with this plan. After checking in at the airport in Sydney, Jin used the restrooms after Sun accidentally spilled coffee on him. As Jin was washing his hands, he was approached by one of Mr. Paik's associates (a Caucasian who shocked Jin by speaking Korean to him), who revealed he knew Jin's hidden agenda, and warned him to deliver the watches or risk losing Sun. Jin then moved on to board the doomed flight.\n\nUpon landing on the island, Jin becomes overprotective of Sun, and forbids her from consorting with the other survivors. Whenever she is approached, Jin scolds her for her poor appearance (most notably when her top button is undone). While the two remain isolated from the others, Jin prepares sea urchin and offers it to the survivors, the only one to turn him down being Hurley (Jorge Garcia). Jin spends most of his time fishing, whilst also keeping a watchful eye over his wife. One morning, Jin assaults Michael (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) and attempts to kill him in front of his son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley). Jin is handcuffed to the wreckage as a result, released only after Michael cuts him free and returns his gold watch to him. (For this reason, Jin continues to wear one handcuff around his wrist, until it is cut off partway into the second season). Later, Jin and Sun move into the caves. When Jack (Matthew Fox) is caught in a cave in, Jin contributes in moving the rubble aside. He soon frowns upon Sun wearing revealing clothes, and even more so when she helps Shannon (Maggie Grace) overcome her asthma.\n\nLater, Jin grabs Sun and yells at her when she decides to go bathing. It is only after Michael intervenes that Jin suspects something going on between the two. That night, Michael's raft is burned down. Jin helps in stopping the flames, but flees to the caves when his hands are scorched. Regardless, Michael blames Jin for the arson attack, and he and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) take their anger out on him by beating him in front of the whole camp. It is only after Sun, revealing her secret to Jin, begs them to stop that Jin is released. He returns to the caves to collect his belongings, blanking out Sun, and joins Michael in building a second raft. Over time, the two begin bonding, eventually becoming mutual friends. Jin stops building the raft only when he hears the distress calls from Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Claire (Emilie de Ravin) in the jungle, where he must help in delivering the baby.\n\nOn the day that the raft sets sail, Sun approaches Jin and gives him a phrasebook she had written for him. Jin apologizes for his actions, and vows to find rescue for her. The two reconcile before departing. Out at sea, Jin helps to maintain the raft's condition. When they encounter the Others that night, Jin dives into the water in an attempt to save Sawyer.\n\nUpon the raft's destruction, Jin washes ashore, being discovered by Libby (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy (Kimberley Joseph). He is taken into the jungle and tied to a tree. Jin breaks free and flees to the beach, encountering Michael and Sawyer. Believing the people to be Others, he attempts to warn the two, until the three are beaten unconscious by Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and thrown into a pit. Upon being released, and their situation mutual, the tail-section survivors lead Jin, Michael and Sawyer back to the station. Before heading off to migrate with the fuselage camp, Jin offers his expertise by catching fish with Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and Bernard (Sam Anderson). When Michael disappears in the jungle, Jin and Mr. Eko run after him, narrowly avoiding an encounter with the Others. The three catch up to the rest of the group, traveling up until Ana Lucia shoots Shannon. Jin is forced to remain behind with Libby and Bernard, until they are given the go-ahead to move on, and being reunited with Sun. The two attend Shannon's funeral.\n\nWhen Jin learns that Michael has gone off to search for Walt, Jin attempts to join the search party, but Sun forbids him to leave her again. Later, Jin grows concerned for his wife when she falls victim to a failed kidnap attempt. Jack and Jin intend to exact revenge on the Others, only for Sawyer to reveal that they had fallen for his long con. Still worried, Jin forbids Sun from tending to her garden, tearing it up in the process. Later, Jin realizes how much he needs her, and attempts to repair the garden. It is then that Sun informs him of her pregnancy, and that it was he who is infertile. Jin considers this a miracle and rejoices. Jin later volunteers to help Bernard build a giant S.O.S. sign in the beach. He is the last person remaining when he decides to quit.\n\nWhen Michael leads Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley to the Others' camp, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) asks Jin to accompany him to the camp via Desmond's (Henry Ian Cusick) boat, to which he accepts only when Sun also insists on going. As they sail to the Other's camp, they pass a strange statue of a four-toed foot. They arrive at the camp, which turns out to be fake. Before setting off, Jin is deafened by a high-pitched noise as the island is engulfed in a strange violet glow.\n\nJin is still on board the boat with Sun and Sayid, and suggests they return to the beach, only to be overruled by Sun and Sayid. They arrive at the pier, where Sayid starts a signal fire. Jin, knowing about Sayid's plan, demands to be given a gun whilst telling Sun that he understands more English than she thinks. That night, Jin and Sayid wait by the end of the pier for the Others to arrive; they are startled to find that they have instead arrived by sea and have gone directly for the boat, where Sun is hiding. Jin ds into the water as the boat sails away, and is reunited with Sun once again when she escapes. The three return to the beach soon after. Days after returning, Sun starts speaking to Jin in English, in an attempt to help him learn. Jin is stubborn, and is left to help Hurley overturn a van in the jungle. When Sawyer arrives, he teaches Jin three phrases that he describes as \"what women want to hear\" (which are, incidentally, \"I'm sorry\", \"You were right\" and \"Those pants don't make you look fat.\") Hurley and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) get the van running, and the four enjoy a joyriding session before returning to the beach, filled with hope.\n\nJin finds himself involved in the investigation over the apparent deaths of survivors Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro). Jin, Hurley and Sawyer find Paulo lying in the jungle. After a brief examination of the surroundings, Jin concludes that the \"Monster\" had killed him. Later, he attends the funeral, unaware that Nikki has opened her eyes moments before being buried. Upon Jack, Kate and Sayid returning to the beach with Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) in tow, Jin shares the same disliking to her as the rest of the camp. Later, Jin joins Hurley, Charlie and Desmond on a trek into the jungle. They witness the bailing of a helicopter pilot that night, and head inland to find them, encountering several pieces of luggage on the way. Jin and Hurley find her hanging from a tree, and the four cut her loose. When Mikhail (Andrew Divoff) arrives, Jin chases after him and catches him. After helping Naomi (Marsha Thomason), Jin pursues Mikhail once again when he steals her satellite phone. The four take her back to the camp and hide her in Hurley's tent.\nAfter she speaks to the camp that night, Juliet's recorder is played to the group, mentioning Sun's pregnancy. Jin asks Sun about Juliet's message, to which he learns of a healthy fetus. When Karl (Blake Bashoff) arrives to warn them of the Others' imminent arrival, Jin volunteers to stay behind and detonate the dynamite inside the targeted tents, along with Sayid and Bernard. That night, Jin's inaccuracy causes the plan to backfire, and three are taken hostage by the surviving Others. The next day, Jin is held at gunpoint in order for the Others to extract the camp's initial plan from Bernard. The three are saved when Hurley, Sawyer and Juliet arrive on the beach and eliminate the Others.\n\nShortly after confirmation that Jack has made contact with the freighter, Jin watches and listens as Desmond delivers Charlie's warning, and ventures into the jungle to meet up with the rest of the camp. After reuniting with Sun, Jin decides to return to the beach with Jack rather than join Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at the barracks. Jin and Sun discuss what they will name their baby, and Jin suggest Ji Yeon. Sun insists it's too early. After a conversation with Kate, Sun decides to head to Locke's camp. In hopes of stopping this Juliet reveals Sun's medical condition, and the affair she had to Jin. Although angry at first, Jin realizes that he was not supportive of Sun and that he pushed her away, so he forgives her and promises that he will never leave her. Later, Sayid returns with the speedboat to take people to the boat. Jin and Sun go with the first group, taking Aaron with them. On the boat, they encounter Michael for the first time since he left the island. Upon discovering a bomb on the boat, Jin, Michael and Desmond attempt to disarm it. While their attempts manage to stall the bomb's detonation, Jin is left on the boat during the bomb's detonation. The freighter explodes and sinks beneath the ocean leading to Sun and the rest of the Oceanic Six believing him to have died in the explosion.\n\nAt the Oceanic 6 conference when a Korean reporter asks Sun if Jin survived the crash, Sun looks very somber and pauses for a minute before replying that he did not. Sun later buys a controlling share of her father's company as retribution for, in her view, his hand in Jin's death. Sun names her daughter Ji Yeon as Jin had asked.\n\nJin's grave in Korea lists the date of the plane crash (Sept 22, 2004) as the date of his death.\n\nIn the fourth episode of the season, after another shift in time, Jin is found unconscious floating on some debris from the freighter by a group of people in a life raft, who turn out to be a young and pregnant Danielle Rousseau (Young: Melissa Farman; Older: Mira Furlan) along with her research team. After realizing who Danielle Rousseau is, Jin is shocked to realize he has traveled back in time to 1988.\n\nJin travels with Danielle's group and leads them to the radio tower. On their way, the smoke monster appears in the middle of the jungle and kills a female member of her group called Nadine. The leader of the group, Montard is dragged down beneath the wall of the temple by the monster. The rest of the group decide to go rescue Montard, but Jin tells Danielle to stay. Suddenly, Jin is torn away through time in front of Danielle and reappears later, she kills the last of her group's survivors because she believes that they had become sick and \"changed\". She tries to kill Jin but he escapes. Another time jump allows him to meet up with Sawyer, Locke, Juliet, Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung) and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader).\n\nJin assists the group with Locke's plan to leave the island and return with the escapees. Threatening his seeming escape via a rope down a well, he makes him promise not to bring Sun back.\n\nSoon after Locke is separated from the group Jin, Sawyer, Juliet and Miles get sent to an ancient time, in which a gigantic statue is seen standing far away from them. After Locke moves the Island by turning the frozen wheel, they get transported to 1974. They then head back to Daniel who informs them that the violent shifts through time had killed Charlotte but that they now had also stopped and wherever they are now they were there to stay. Jin and the others then rescue a woman from the DHARMA Initiative called Amy from two Others and they then move into the barracks with other DHARMA members. They are welcomed to stay there.\n\nThree years later, in 1977, Jin along with Sawyer (under the alias James LaFleur), Juliet, and Miles are all shown to be still there. Jin can now speak fluent English, as is shown in his conversation with Sawyer where he both understands and replies to Sawyer regarding John's quest to bring the others back. Jin's job is to search for Locke and their friends. For the three years there were no signs. But one morning, Jin drives across a waterfall and discovers Jack, Kate and Hurley and he drives all three of them to meet Sawyer.\n\nWhile on a perimeter check he notices the men fleeing into the bushes. He steps out of his vehicle to acknowledge little Ben (Young: Sterling Beaumon; Old: Michael Emerson), who is a reluctant member of DHARMA, and fugitive Sayid. Sayid says that LaFleur gave him the opportunity to run. As Jin calls LaFleur to confirm this Sayid attacks Jin and knocks him unconscious. Sayid leaves him and Ben behind after shooting Ben in the chest with Jin's sidearm. Jin later gains consciousness and brings Ben to the DHARMA infirmary.\n\nLater, Sawyer holds a meeting to decide what to do after their presence in the Dharma Initiative becomes risky. Eventually, the survivors decide to leave the DHARMA Initiative and start all over at the beach. However, their plan is foiled when Sawyer and Juliet are caught.\n\nJin, Hurley, and Miles aid Jack and Sayid in taking them to the Swan Station construction site via DHARMA van, where they plan to detonate the electromagnetic pocket and prevent Oceanic 815 from ever crashing twenty-seven years from now. Jin is tending to a critically injured Sayid, who was shot by Ben's father (Jon Gries), when Juliet manages to detonate the hydrogen bomb, leaving all of their fate unknown.\n\nJin and his friends jump back through time to 2007, still on the Island, after the explosion. He joins Hurley, Jack, Miles, Kate, Sawyer and Sayid in the Temple, the Others' home, to stay protected from the Man in Black/Smoke Monster, but he wants to leave in order to find his wife who he has been told is also on the Island. When Sawyer leaves, he joins Kate and two Others to go look for him; after Kate knocks out the guards to leave the Temple forever, he decides to do the same in order to find Sun. However, the two Others attack him and while running away from them, he gets caught in an old bear trap, which happens to be Claire's. She kills the two Others.\n\nJin is brought to Claire's home, a hut, where he is treated by Claire. He asks her of her survival on the Island for the past three years, growing suspicious of her. He then is greeted by the Man in Black, masquerading as Locke, whom Claire states is her \"friend.\" While still too hurt to walk and obviously a prisoner, Claire looks at Jin as a friend and even talks to the Man in Black about Jin as an ally to their cause to kill the Others.\n\nJin is skeptical of the Man in Black and believes he is not Locke. When James, having been captured by the Man in Black, joins him, Jin tells his friend he wants to find Sun first, to which Sawyer agrees. However, Jin has no choice but to follow the Man in Black's group as they journey across the Island. Sawyer and the Man in Black tell him that he is a possible \"candidate\" of Jacob's (the leader of the Island and enemy of the Man in Black), meaning he may be chosen to watch the Island after Jacob's death. However, he is unaware of the Man in Black's intention to kill him, since he is a candidate. Late one night, while the Man in Black is off retrieving Sun (as she may be a candidate as well), Jin and the others are attacked by Charles Widmore's team. Tranquilized, Jin is brought over to the second Island where Widmore's submarine is docked. Jin wakes up inside a DHARMA Initiative complex and meets Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who eagerly asks him about his hand-drawn map of the electromagnetism pockets, which he drew back in 1977. However, he demands to see Widmore.\n\nWidmore greets Jin and hands him Sun's digital camera. On it, Jin tearfully views photographs of his daughter, seeing his girl for the first time. Widmore then explains to him that everyone will cease to exist should the Man in Black leave the Island, and that he himself is here to prevent that from happening. Jin asks how will he accomplish this, to which Widmore replies that they should see a \"package.\"\n\nWhen Sawyer's group (which consists of Sawyer, Sun, Claire, Kate, Hurley and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), the helicopter pilot who appeared in seasons four and five) arrives, he finally reunites with his long-lost love, only for their reunion to be short-lived, when Widmore and Zoe decide to arrest Sawyer's group and Jin.\n\nThe group is then thrown into the polar bear cages at the Hydra, but are rescued by the Man in Black, Sayid and Jack. Jin and some of the group enter Widmore's submarine to escape the island, leaving The Man in Black and Claire behind. A bomb is then revealed to be inside Jack's bag, which causes Sayid to run away from the group and explode with the bomb, causing water to gush in and sink the submarine. Sun becomes trapped under wreckage caused by the blast, so Sawyer, Jin and Jack try to free her, but they realize she cannot be removed. Another collision causes Sawyer to get knocked unconscious, causing Jin to plead with Jack to save Sawyer. Despite Sun's pleas for Jin to save himself, he decides to stay with her, they both drown.\n\nIn the afterlife, Jin works at Mr. Paik's company, and that is where he met Sun, eventually having an affair. Jin is assigned to deliver a watch and a wad of cash to deliver in a meeting. Jin is on Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, and Sun accompanies him. At Los Angeles International Airport, he fails to declare the cash at customs, since he couldn't understand English and does not know how to claim it. He misses the meeting in the process. Jin and Sun then go back to their hotel, and they both make out in Sun's room. The next morning, two men named Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi) arrive to get the watch and the money. Since Keamy and Omar cannot understand them, they consult the help of translator Mikhail Bakunin, in which they explain the situation to the three. Sun and Mikhail go to the bank to get more money, and Keamy and Omar trap Jin in the freezer. When Sayid arrives, he kills Keamy and his men (including Omar), and help Jin escape. When Sun and Mikhail arrive, Jin kills Mikhail, but injures Sun in the process. Sun then confesses that she is pregnant. Sun eventually recovers at the hospital, and the baby is safe. When Juliet, their doctor does an ultrasound on their baby, they remember moments from the original timeline, and they perfectly speak English and call their baby \"Ji Yeon.\" They then unite with their friends from the original timeline in a church to move on.\n\nDaniel Dae Kim described his audition as a \"really interesting experience\". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he hadn’t spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.\n\nJin is the only major character who could not speak English before arriving on the island (though he does speak it in one of Hurley's dream sequences), and has been receiving tutelage from Sun and Sawyer. Ironically, Daniel Dae Kim has the opposite problem: though Korean-born, he was raised in Pennsylvania, speaks English as his native language, and had to receive tutelage in Korean to prepare for the role. Despite Jin's inability to speak English, he can understand it better than most characters think, deducing that Sun and Sayid are lying to him in \"The Glass Ballerina\". He manages only rudimentary English by the end of season three, but by the end of season four, he can understand most of what is said to him, and can speak English with minimal difficulty. Furthermore, after living for three years on the island, as shown in the episode \"LaFleur\", he is fluent save for an accent.\n\nMilitary service for a minimum of twenty-one months is compulsory in South Korea. This, in addition to Jin's mob experience, may explain his familiarity with handguns as seen in \"The Glass Ballerina\" and \"Through the Looking Glass.\"\n\nSimilarly to the Chinese and Japanese naming system, the convention in the Korean naming system is to put the family name first in the person's name. Therefore, Jin's name should technically be Kwon Jin-Soo or Kwon Jinsoo, rather than Jin-Soo Kwon. However, when his name is spoken in the Korean flashbacks, it is said in the Korean manner.\n"}
{"id": "2231019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231019", "title": "Sun-Hwa Kwon", "text": "Sun-Hwa Kwon\n\nSun-Hwa Kwon (née Paik), better known simply as \"Sun\", is a fictional character on the ABC television series \"Lost\" played by Yunjin Kim.\n\nSun was born on March 20, 1980 into the powerful Paik family; natives of Seoul. As a child, Sun was taught how to play the piano. On at least one occasion, she blamed the results of some mischief on a maid in order to avoid punishment. Later, Sun attended Seoul National University, majoring in Art History. When she returned without a husband, her mother arranged for her to meet a potential suitor, Jae Lee. The two hit it off until Jae Lee revealed that he planned on marrying an American woman. An upset Sun left him, only to quite literally bump into Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), her future husband. While Sun had doubts regarding her father's approval, she was surprised when Jin presented her with an engagement ring. They were wed in Korea, and at the reception, they were complimented by a Korean-speaking Jacob. Shortly after the wedding, however, Sun was approached by a woman claiming to be Jin's mother; she blackmailed Sun into paying her a large sum of money, with the threat of bringing shame upon the Paik family by revealing Jin to be the son of a fisherman and a prostitute. Sun asked her father for the money, but when she did not provide a reason, Mr. Paik assumed it was for Jin, and assigned him a new job until the debt was paid. Over time, Jin grew distant from Sun, and she planned on escaping her failing marriage. She began taking English lessons from Jae Lee, whose own plans had not worked out.\n\nAfter many lessons; the relationship between Sun and Jae Lee developed into an affair. The two were eventually found in bed together by Mr. Paik and the affair ended. Sun and Jin had been trying to conceive a child, but after visiting a fertility doctor, they were informed that Sun was unable to conceive due to severe endometriosis, causing more strain on the marriage. Later, however, the doctor confided in Sun that it was Jin who was infertile, and that he was afraid to tell him because of his job as an enforcer. Later, Sun learned of Jae Lee's death and attended his funeral. She asked her father if he would tell Jin about her affair, to which he declined, saying that it was not his place. During preparations for a business trip, with Jin, to Sydney and Los Angeles; Sun spoke privately with a woman acting as an interior decorator. Sun had planned to leave Jin and her family and the woman had helped Sun set up a false identity (and a place for her to hide until the search for her ended). She was given instructions to leave Jin at the Sydney airport at 11:15 precisely; a car would be waiting outside the Oceanic Airlines gate and she was to maintain a low profile.\n\nAt the airport, Sun was prepared to follow her instructions, and heads towards the car outside. A single moment of tenderness from Jin, however, caused her to change her mind, and she decided to accompany him to Los Angeles. At the airport restaurant, she purchased food for the two of them. Sun accidentally spilled coffee on Jin and after he left to clean himself off; she listened to the snide remarks of a couple seated a few tables away. She and Jin then boarded the doomed flight.\n\nFollowing the crash, Jin is overly protective of Sun and tells her that they must isolate themselves from the other survivors. Whenever other survivors, particularly Michael, attempt to communicate with her, Sun is frowned upon by Jin. One morning, Jin is handcuffed to the wreckage after attacking Michael, and Sun attempts to indicate the watch that Michael is wearing. Sayid misinterprets this as a plea to remove the cuffs. Sun approaches Michael in the jungle and, to his surprise, explains about the watch in English, asking him to keep her bilingualism a secret. Prior to moving into the caves with Jin, Sun attempts to bury her fake I.D. when she is caught by Michael; the two share a brief tender moment before Sun flees. Later, Sun helps move the fallen rocks after Jack is caught in a cave in, and is almost volunteered to crawl through the narrow tunnel to save him by Jin. When Shannon suffers a near-fatal asthma attack, Sun asks Michael to gather some eucalyptus plants, in order for her to make an herbal remedy for her. Her assistance is scorned by Jin.\n\nSun creates a garden in the jungle, where she grows a variety of different herbs and fruit plants. She is helped by Kate, who then figures out that she speaks English. She begs Kate not to tell anyone else. Later, Sun attempts to bathe in the sea, but is quickly escorted away by Jin, prompting Michael to intervene. Sun slaps him for intervening, but apologizes to him later. Jin suspects something between the two and grows wary. That night, after the raft burns down, Sun discovers Jin in the caves with burn marks on his hands. She asks Jin if he caused the fire, to which he grows angry. When he is accused and beaten by Michael, Sun is forced to reveal her long-hidden bilingualism in front of Jin, and begs Michael to stop. Later, Jin leaves Sun, refusing to speak to her. When Boone is brought to the caves in critical condition, Sun helps Jack in the ensuing operation, retrieving a sea urchin in order for Jack to make a blood transfusion. Despite their efforts, Boone dies later that night.\n\nSun expresses her worry to Kate about Jin leaving her. Following her advice, Sun poisons Jin's drinking water, but ends up poisoning Michael instead. Only Kate and Jack know about this. Moments before departing, Sun writes Jin a phrasebook, containing English words written in Korean phonetics. This leads Jin to apologise to Sun for his behaviour. Jin believes he is on the island because he is being punished. Jin tells Sun that he is leaving because he is going to rescue her. The two reconcile before Jin departs on the raft.\n\nSun is approached by Claire and Shannon, who give her the message bottle taken on the raft. In a bid to keep it a secret, Sun buries it on the beach. She notices later that she has lost her wedding ring, and frantically searches for it, even tearing up her garden. She later finds it buried with the bottle. A few days later, Sun and Jin are reunited as the tail-section survivors of the plane migrate on the beach. When the two learn of Michael's sudden departure to look for Walt, Sun refuses to allow Jin to help, reminding him that she is his wife. She later tells Jin that she doesn't like being undermined by him, and the two vow to prevent it from occurring in the future. One day, while working in her garden, Sun is bagged and tied from behind; Sun manages to escape, but does not see who attempted to kidnap her. Sun passes out, and reawakens at the camp, remembering little of the traumatic experience.\n\nFearing for her safety, Jin disallows Sun to tend to her garden, going as far as ripping it apart. Sun returns to the beach, where she starts feeling light-headed. She asks Sawyer for a pregnancy test. Upon learning of her pregnancy, Sun is forced to tell Jin. She tells Jin that he is infertile, but swears that she has slept with no other; she had an affair with Jae Lee, but Jin never found out. Later, Sayid informs Sun of his plan to sail to the Others' camp using Desmond's boat, and asks her to ask Jin to sail for him. Sun does so, but demands that she come along too, knowing that Sayid will need someone to translate for him. As they sail to the Others' camp, they come across a statue of a four-toed foot. Sun and Jin remain on the boat while Sayid searches the Others' camp. Moments later, the three experience a deafening sound as the island is engulfed in a violet glow.\n\nSun is still on board the boat with Jin and Sayid, and eventually arrive at the pier. Sayid informs Sun of his plan to kidnap two of the Others, and asks her to lie to Jin. However, Jin reveals to Sun that he understands more English than she thinks. Sun hides in the boat that night while the other two wait outside. However, the Others head directly to the boat via sea, and Sun encounters Colleen. Startled by the boat's motor, Sun shoots Colleen, fatally injuring her. Sun manages to escape, narrowly avoiding Tom's gunfire. She makes it to shore, where she, Jin and Sayid return to the beach. Sun cares for Aaron one day while Claire goes for a swim, and is oblivious that she is drowning. Later, Sun attempts to help Jin speak English, by refusing to speak to him in Korean.\n\nLater, she and Jin help Claire in catching a bird. When Desmond thwarts their plans, Sun encourages Claire to investigate. The next day, Sun is involved in the investigation of the apparent deaths of Nikki and Paulo. At first, she suspects food poisoning, but later blames the Others, referencing the time she was almost kidnapped. She learns that it was merely a staged act, planned by Sawyer. She threatens that the next grave dug will be his if Jin finds out, and slaps him. She also returns the diamonds he gave her, branding them as worthless on the island. Since then, Sun refuses to speak directly to Sawyer. After Juliet migrates to the camp, Sun demands to know about pregnancy on the island, and is shocked to learn that women die during pregnancy. Juliet takes Sun to the station, where she uses the medical equipment to determine a date of conception; Sun learns that she conceived on the island, making Jin the father, but leaving Sun with less than two months to live before her second trimester.\n\nSun's trust in Juliet is broken when, during a camp meeting one night, Juliet's recorder is played, revealing a message informing Ben of Sun's pregnancy. She tells Jin that the baby is healthy, but never tells him about her fate. When Karl arrives to warn them of the Others' imminent arrival, Sun travels with the majority of the camp to the radio tower, while Jin stays behind. That night, she watches Jack's plan backfire, and grows concerned over the fate of her husband. Later, however, she and Rose are relieved to hear that their husbands are alive. She watches as Jack makes contact with Naomi's freighter.\n\nFollowing Jack's success in contacting the freighter, Sun and Claire tend to Aaron shortly before heading back to the beach with the majority of the group. She is reunited with Jin at the crash site of the airplane cockpit. After learning of Charlie's death and Locke's plan to return to the barracks, Sun and Jin remain with Jack and return to the beach, awaiting apparent rescue. However Sun grows suspicious about the motives of their rescuers, and decides to leave with Jin. However, when Juliet finds out, in hopes of saving Sun's life, she reveals Sun's illness to Jin, and also tells him about her affair. Jin walks away from Sun, and Sun fears he is leaving her. Sun confronts Juliet, who reminds her that she has to get off the island in three weeks, or else she is dead. Jin later forgives Sun, and she decides she does not want to go with Locke.\n\nWhen Sayid returns to begin ferrying people back to the freighter, Juliet states Sun should be the first to go as she is pregnant and as Aaron is in her care. When they reach the boat, Sun is shocked to see Michael; their conversation is cut short when masses of C4 are found. Jin tells Sun to go back on deck where she looks on nervously.\nIn the season finale, Sun manages to get on the helicopter piloted by Lapidus, where the rest of the Oceanic Six are already seated. Sun, however, refuses to leave Jin behind, who is still attempting to postpone the blast. Amid chaos, Sun is forced onto the helicopter, and as it becomes airborne, she sees Jin running on deck, waving his hands frantically. Sun pleads with Lapidus to land, but he refuses, since they are low on fuel. The freighter explodes via the strapped bomb monitor on Keamy, whom Ben kills. Sun screams in agony. Jack tells her Jin is gone, and Sun falls into an extended state of shock. The helicopter tries to land back on the Island, but Ben and Locke make it disappear. The six survivors of Oceanic 815, Lapidus, and Desmond take refuge on a raft, and soon they are spotted by Penelope Widmore's rescue ship. The Oceanic Six spend a week on the ship, before heading off to Sumba.\n\nSun becomes one of the Oceanic Six, one of the six publicly known survivors of Flight 815. As part of the cover-up story, Sun reveals that Jin never made it off the plane after it crashed. Shortly after arriving home in Korea, Sun buys a majority share of her father's company with part of the Oceanic settlement that she received, and tells him that she holds him as one of two people responsible for Jin's death (the second person being Ben, as revealed in Season 5.) Several months later, Sun goes into labor and gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She names her daughter Ji Yeon, due to Jin's request on the island. She is later visited by Hurley, and the two visit Jin's grave, where Sun says that she misses him and was calling for him during labor, knowing that he wasn't there.\n\nA few years later, Sun travels to London to meet with Charles Widmore. She tells him that she knows he is looking for the island, and that the Oceanic Six are lying. She gives Widmore her business card and tells him to contact her when he is ready to work with her before walking away.\n\nSun traveled to Los Angeles from Korea when she is detained by Charles Widmore. He questions her motives for approaching him so disrespectfully, before asking what it is she thinks they have in common. Sun informs him that their only shared interest is in killing Benjamin Linus. While in Los Angeles, Sun contacts Kate, and lets her know she doesn't blame her for not finding Jin before boarding the helicopter; Kate did the right thing, and now she must do so again by protecting Aaron at all costs.\n\nLater on, Kate decides to track down the lawyer in charge of a case against her and asks Sun to look after Aaron, while looking after him she receives a package which contains chocolates and a gun. At the end of the episode, Sun is told by Kate to meet up with her and follows them to a marina where she watches from her car the group discussing Hurley and Aaron before picking up the gun and leaving the car.\n\nSun, however, landed, in the year 2007, on Hydra Island near the main Island along with the majority of the 316 passengers (including Ben, Lapidus, and Locke). When Ben moves into the jungle in attempt to return to the main Island, she follows him and is in turn followed by Lapidus. Sun knocks Ben out with a paddle when they reach a pair of canoes and she and Lapidus then continue to the Island. They find the Barracks empty, save for Christian. When Sun asks where Jin is, Christian informs her that he is on the Island, but in the year 1977.\n\nAfter meeting the supposedly resurrected John Locke, she follows him to the Others' camp. The man posing as Locke tells her that if there is a way to reunite her with her husband, he will find it. When Sun is not present, however, the fake Locke tells Ben that he has no interest in reuniting Sun and Jin. When the Others pass through the old beach camp, Sun finds Charlie's ring inside Aaron's old cradle. She is later present at the Statue remnants when Other Ilana arrives with her people and proves the resurrected Locke to be an impostor by revealing the body of the real John Locke.\n\nAfter the fake Locke, revealed to be the Island's Smoke Monster and more formally the Man in Black, kidnaps Richard and the Others gathered at the Statue depart for the Temple, Sun requests that those still at the statue (herself, Ilana, Ben and Frank) bury Locke.\nThey take his body to the graveyard of 815 survivors near the beach and bury it. After this, the four head to the Temple, where they arrive in the middle of the Smoke Monster's massacre of the Others who remain there, and meet up with Miles. They escape through a passageway and head for the beach.\n\nAt the beach, Hurley, Jack, and Richard arrive shortly after. As they all decide what to do next, Sun grows impatient, and retreats to her garden for alone time. However, the Man in Black appears to her and insists that she follow him, since he has Jin. Sun runs off, however, she bumps her head on a low branch and falls unconscious. Upon awakening, she realizes she can no longer speak English; Jack assures her it is because of temporary aphasia. They all decide to destroy the Ajira Airways plane to prevent the Man in Black from escaping, but after a series of disagreements between Richard and Hurley, the group split; Ben, Miles, and Richard will search for more explosives, while the rest will go talk with the Man in Black.\n\nJack, Hurley, Sun, and Lapidus then run off to join Sawyer and Kate at the docks, hoping to abandon the Man in Black and seek refuge at Hydra Island with Charles Widmore's people. Claire later joins them, but Jack leaves because he wants to stay on the Island, per Jacob's request. Upon arriving there, Sun sees Jin and finally reunites, breaking her aphasia. However, Widmore's people throw them into cages, Widmore claiming this is for their own good. That night, the Man in Black, as the Smoke Monster, attack the base, and Jack frees them. Meeting with Sayid, they make their way to the Ajira flight, but the Man in Black claims that if they are to escape the Island, they should take Widmore's submarine. At the dock, however, Widmore's men engage in a gunfight with them, forcing the submarine to leave Claire and the Man in Black behind. Inside the sub, Jack discovers C-4 in his pack, realizing the Man in Black set them up. While Sawyer wants to disable it, Jack assures that it will be alright, since the Man in Black cannot kill them unless they tamper with the bomb themselves. Sawyer does so, not trusting Jack, but increases the timer. Sayid runs off with the bomb in a suicidal move, trying to save some of the others; it detonates, flooding the sub. Sun is pinned to the wall by fragments, and Jin desperately tries to free her. As the submarine slowly floods, Sun begs Jin to leave her, but he insists on staying, telling her in Korean that they will never be apart again. They share one final passionate kiss and embrace before they drown, holding hands. Shortly after she died, Jack, Kate and Hurley all cried over her and Jin's deaths.\n\nOriginally Yunjin Kim auditioned for the role of Kate. At her audition she explained she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several movies. The producers liked her so much that they created Sun just for her. The character was planned to be someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it.\n"}

Although often influential within the indigenous culture, its members do not usually function as a modern nation's primary law-making body (cf. British House of Lords), being neither representative (i.e. democratically elected) nor consisting of members appointed individually by the government in power, whether democratic or not. It consists of all or some of the \"traditional leaders\", historically known in English as chiefs, of a country or a sub-division thereof.\n\nA House of Chiefs is not, constitutionally, a partisan institution within the body politic. Members of a House of Chiefs are selected neither by a universal suffrage process of those they represent nor by the state executive or legislature they advise: Their function is to express a cultural, historical and/or ethnic point of view on public policies. The process by which individuals qualify for membership varies, but is based on tradition specific to his or her (e.g. the Rain Queen) historic community or ethnic group. Sometimes the qualifying position is obtained through heredity within a local dynasty, sometimes through selection by consensus of a ritually or socially prominent subset of a community, and sometimes by a combination thereof.\n\nHistorically, chiefs were the last indigenous rulers before colonisation of a people, and their modern versions often continue to play a local cultural role of varying significance. Especially in colonial times, chiefs were often used as instruments of indirect rule, and/or convenient alternatives to elective institutions.\n\nIn the post-colonial age, various Houses of Chiefs and similar assemblies have existed in various nations:\n\n\n\nThe term has also been used for similar pre- and post-colonial assemblies of tribal leaders, such as among certain Native American tribes.\n\nAnother way to include traditional chiefs in a nation's political life is to assign them a number of seats in a wider assembly. In Zimbabwe, for example, ten chiefs are chosen to be members of the Senate, the upper house of the country's parliament. From 1990 to 2005, they were represented in the House of Assembly (now the lower house) when it was the sole legislative chamber.\n"}

The list includes introduced species, common vagrants, recently extinct species, extirpated species, some very rare vagrants (seen once) and species only present in captivity. 627 species are listed.\n\nThe taxonomy is based on Christidis and Boles, 2008. Their system has been developed over nearly two decades and has strong local support, but deviates in important ways from more generally accepted schemes.\n\nThis list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of \"The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World\", 2019 edition. All of the birds below are included in the total bird count for Western Australia.\n\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\n\n\nOrder: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae\n\nThis order is not native to Western Australia, but feral populations of one species have become established.\nOrder: CasuariiformesFamily: Dromaiidae\n\nThis family of flightless ratite birds is represented by two living species in Australia. Another two species are found in New Guinea. The extinct, geographically-isolated King and Kangaroo Island emus were historically considered to be separate species to mainland emus. However, genetic evidence from 2011 suggests that all three are conspecific.\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anseranatidae\nThe family contains a single species, the magpie goose. It was an early and distinctive offshoot of the anseriform family tree, diverging after the screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans, sometime in the late Cretaceous. The single species is found across Australia.\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\n\nThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Megapodiidae\nMegapodiidae are represented by various species in the Australasian region. They are commonly referred to as \"mound-builders\" due to their habit of constructing large mounds to incubate their eggs.\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Numididae\n\nNumididae are not native to Australia, but feral populations of one species exist in Western Australia.\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae\nPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.\n\nOrder: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae\nGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. \n\nOrder: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae\nPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.\n\nOrder: OtidiformesFamily: Otididae\n\nOrder: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Podargidae\n\nThe frogmouths are a distinctive group of small nocturnal birds related to swifts found from India across southern Asia to Australia.\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Aegothelidae\n\nThe owlet-nightjars are a distinctive group of small nocturnal birds related to swifts found from the Maluku Islands and New Guinea to Australia and New Caledonia. \n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Apodidae\n\nSwifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. \nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Haematopodidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Rostratulidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Jacanidae\n\n2 species recorded [1 extant native, 1 vagrant]\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Turnicidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae\n\nOrder: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae\nTropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their long wings have black markings, as does the head.\n\nOrder: SphenisciformesFamily: Spheniscidae\nPenguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Only one species, the little penguin, breeds on the Australian coast.\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae\n\nThe albatrosses are a family of large seabird found across the Southern and North Pacific Oceans. The largest are among the largest flying birds in the world.\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae\n\nThe southern storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterised by united nostrils with medium nasal septum, and a long outer functional primary flight feather.\n\nOrder: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae\nThe sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. \nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae\n\nAnhingas or darters are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, straight bills. They are fish eaters which often swim with only their neck above the water.\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae\n\nCormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of coloured skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed, a distinguishing feature among the order Pelecaniformes.\n\nOrder: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae\n\nPelicans are large water birds with distinctive pouches under their bills.

She was the daughter of Platt Rogers Spencer, a reformer and promoter of the Spencerian Method, the widely used form of handwriting.\n\nMussey was born on May 13, 1850, in Geneva, Ohio, United States. Between the age of 12 and the time of her father's death, when she was age 14, she was an assistant at his penmanship school. Thereafter she took up residence with relatives and attended Rice's Young Ladies' Seminary in Poughkeepsie, New York, Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, and Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois.\n\nIn 1871 she married Reuben D. Mussey, a former Union Army colonel, who was nominated but not confirmed to the grade of brevet brigadier general; he was also a successful lawyer. Having been denied admission at the law schools of National University and Columbian College (now George Washington University), Ellen Mussey tutored herself in the field of law and underwent legal training in her husband's law office and began to practice law. Reuben Mussey died May 29, 1892, which might have ended Ellen Mussey's law practice carried out under her husband's name. She obtained special consideration and was allowed to qualify for the bar by oral examination, which she passed in March, 1893. In 1896, Ellen Spencer Mussey was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nShe was approached in 1895 by Delia Sheldon Jackson, an aspiring attorney, to apprentice her as a student of law. Realizing both the scope of the task and the significance of the opportunity, Mussey sought out the assistance of a colleague and friend, Emma Gillett. The two opened the first session of the Woman's Law Class on February 1, 1896. The class had an enrollment of three: Jackson and two other women, Nanette Paul and Helen Malcolm.\n\nWithin a few years, the program had expanded and several prominent Washington, DC attorneys were brought in for assistance. Although Mussey and Gillett had not initially aspired to establish an independent law school, when Columbian College refused their request to take on the women they had educated for their final year of education—-on grounds that \"women did not have the mentality for law\"—they decided to establish a co-educational law school specifically open to women.\n\nThus, in April 1898, the Washington College of Law (now merged with American University) was incorporated in Washington, DC, as the first law school in the world founded by women. Mussey served as the first dean of the college as serving until her retirement in 1913. \n\nWith Emma Gillett, Mussey founded the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia on May 19, 1917, and was elected its first President. The WBA was one of the first organizations for women lawyers in United States. In 1919, Mussey also helped to found the National Association of Women Lawyers. Mussey also served as the first chairwoman of the Women's City Club of Washington, D.C., which was founded in the same year.\n\nMussey died on April 21, 1936, in Washington, D.C.\n\n"}

It was released on 4 October 1999 on Virgin Records. This was Bowie's final album for the EMI sub-label. It was the first complete album by a major artist available to download over the Internet, preceding the physical release by two weeks.\n\n\"Hours\" was the first Bowie studio album to miss the US top 40 since his 1972 album \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" and peaked at number 47.\n\nBowie and Reeves Gabrels wrote the songs for both \"Hours\" and the adventure video game \"\" at the same time. According to Gabrels, they set up special writing sessions to write the music for these projects, then recorded demos in studios in Bermuda and Paris. Gabrels himself wrote over 3 hours of instrumental songs for the game (on top of the songs which he and Bowie had written together). Gabrels described these tracks as \"more electronic and aggressive in nature than the \"Hours\" album\" and suggested there would be an \"Omikron, The Nomad Soul\" instrumental album released the next year.\n\n\"Hours\" was thought of as the soundtrack CD for \"Omikron\" as late as June 1999. In the game, released by Eidos Interactive about a month later than the album, Bowie played the role of a character called Boz, while his wife Iman appeared as an \"incarnable\" who introduced \"virtual reincarnation\". Furthermore, Bowie appeared together with Gabrels and Gail Ann Dorsey as \"The Dreamers\", a virtual band performing in bars around Omikron City. Characters in the game could also buy a virtual album that they could listen to in their apartments. \"Omikron: The Nomad Soul\" included eight songs, all of them also appeared on \"Hours\" (\"We All Go Through\" only as a Japanese bonus track, but also as a related single b-side and on the 2005 bonus disc). At an E3 press conference Bowie said \"I moved right away from the stereotypical industrial game-music sound. My priority in writing music for Omikron was to give it an emotional subtext. It feels to me as though Reeves and I have achieved that. We both worked really close with Quantic Dream to come up with eight new songs for the game.\"\n\nThe game also included 34 \"Instrumental Songs\", of which 26 were written and performed by Gabrels and 8 by Bowie and Gabrels. Half of the tracks by Bowie and Gabrels were \"easy listening versions\" of some of the vocal songs. Some of the other \"instrumental songs\" would be further developed and released as b-sides, for instance \"Awakened 2\" is an instrumental version of \"No One Calls\" and \"Thrust\" (as heard during a rooftop fight with a demon) would become \"1917\". Only three songs on \"Hours\" were not from \"Omikron\": \"If I'm Dreaming My Life\", \"What's Really Happening\" and \"Brilliant Adventure\" (although the latter was actually considered as incidental music for the game).\n\nGabrels remembered how originally, \"we did a different version of the \"Hours\" record, and I had played bass on that, and we let it sit and then we listened to it, and David said it was too raw. I thought it had a certain \"Diamond Dogs\" quality, but he wanted it to be more slick and polished and have fretless bass. … Mark Plati came in at the end of \"Hours\" to play fretless bass and remix the record.\" This was one of the changes that frustrated Gabrels, ultimately leading to Gabrels quitting working with Bowie a short time later. He said, \"There’s a track from the \"Hours\" era that was a b-side called 'And We Shall Go To Town' that I thought was a key track for that album and it ended up being taken off the album, and that was part of the final straw for me. It was a very dark track.\"\n\nTo drum up interest in the impending album, a \"Cyber Song\" contest was held on Bowie's personal website BowieNet to compose lyrics to an early instrumental version of the song \"What's Really Happening\". The winning lyrics would be featured on \"Hours\". Contest winner Alex Grant also won a trip to Philip Glass' Looking Glass Studios on 24 May 1999 to watch Bowie record the final vocal during a live Webcast. There, Grant contributed backing vocals to the song, along with a friend who accompanied him.\n\nThe original title for the album was going to be \"The Dreamers\", after the album's closing track.\n\nThe album cover, designed by Rex Ray with photography by Tim Bret Day and Frank Ockenfels, depicts the short-haired Bowie persona from the intensely energetic previous album \"Earthling\" exhausted, resting in the arms of a long-haired, more youthful version of Bowie. Indeed, \"Hours\" is a much mellower album than its predecessor, and features numerous references to earlier parts of Bowie's musical career (particularly the early 1970s). For the album's initial release, a number of copies featured a lenticular version of the cover, lending a three-dimensional effect to the image.\nAllMusic's senior critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"it may not be one of Bowie's classics, but it's the work of a masterful musician who has begun to enjoy his craft again and isn't afraid to let things develop naturally.\" \"Rolling Stone\" critic Greg Tate described the record as \"an album that improves with each new hearing\" and \"further confirmation of Richard Pryor's observation that they call them old wise men because all them young wise men are dead\". Similarly impressed, \"Alternative Press\" described \"Hours\" as \"a masterpiece\", adding that it \"finds Bowie returning to basics he never should have left behind\".\n\nRyan Schreiber of \"Pitchfork\" criticised the album, saying: \"\"Hours\" opts for a spacy, but nonetheless adult-contemporary sound that comes across with all the vitality and energy of a rotting log.\" Schreiber further stated: \"No, it's not a new low, but that doesn't mean it's not embarrassing.\" Writing for \"Select\", John Mullen considered the album to be an improvement on \"Earthling\", but likened Bowie to a \"more high-brow\" version of Sting and concluded: \"Even on the personal exorcism of 'Seven' there's a lack of urgency that suggests that the 'confessional' is just another style Bowie's trying out for size.\"\n\nAn edition with additional tracks was released in 2004. In January 2005, Bowie's new label ISO Records reissued \"Hours\" as a double CD set with the second CD comprising remixes, alternate versions, and single B-sides.\n\nBowie took the album on the road for the 3-month Hours Tour in late 1999. In August, he appeared on VH1's \"Storytellers\", and in October, he appeared on the 25th season of \"Saturday Night Live\" to perform \"Thursday's Child\" and \"Rebel Rebel\". His appearance on \"VH1 Storytellers\" was released in 2009 as \"VH1 Storytellers\".\n\nAdapted from AllMusic.\n"}

He married Mabel Payne in 1904. They would have two sons and four daughters. His son Geoffrey later served in the Newfoundland assembly.\n\nAfter several failed attempts in colonial politics, he decided to enter municipal politics.In the municipal elections of 1929 for St. John's, he was elected deputy mayor. After the sitting mayor, Charles Howlett, died in 1932, Carnell became acting mayor until he was elected to the post officially by acclamation the following year. He would be reelected to the position continuously until 1949. Carnell's term spanned the time under which Newfoundland was a Crown colony of the United Kingdom after the Dominion government had gone bankrupt and collapsed. To many Newfoundlanders, the mayor was the voice of the people as the highest-ranking official on the island that had been elected. To the colonial government, however, the city council was an inefficient nuisance. Nevertheless, Carnell was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1939.\n\nThroughout his term, Carnell's administration would continue to provide relatively stable and solvent government to St. John's, leading the way in debt relief, improving the standard and affordability of housing in the city and beginning construction on Memorial Stadium, which would be finished in 1955. The 'LaGuardia of St. John's' would be defeated by his deputy mayor, Harry Mews, in the 1949 election.\n"}
{"id": "2231059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231059", "title": "Superheavy element", "text": "Superheavy element\n\nIn chemistry, superheavy elements, also known as transactinide elements, transactinides, or super-heavy elements, are the chemical elements with atomic numbers greater than 103. The superheavy elements are located immediately beyond the actinides in the periodic table; the heaviest actinide is lawrencium (atomic number 103). By definition, superheavy elements are also transuranic elements, i.e. having atomic numbers greater than that of uranium (92).\n\nGlenn T. Seaborg first proposed the actinide concept, which led to the acceptance of the actinide series. He also proposed a transactinide series ranging from element 104 to 121 and the superactinide series approximately spanning elements 122 to 153 (although more recent work suggests the end of the superactinide series to occur at element 157 instead). The transactinide seaborgium was named in his honor.\n\nSuperheavy elements are radioactive and have only been obtained synthetically in laboratories. None of these elements have ever been collected in a macroscopic sample. Superheavy elements are all named after physicists and chemists or important locations involved in the synthesis of the elements.\n\nIUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10 seconds, which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud.\n\nThe superheavy elements all have electrons in the 6d subshell in their ground state. Except for rutherfordium and dubnium, even the longest-lasting isotopes of superheavy elements have short half-lives of minutes or less. The element naming controversy involved elements 102–109. Some of these elements thus used systematic names for many years after their discovery had been confirmed. (Usually the systematic names are replaced with permanent names proposed by the discoverers relatively shortly after a discovery has been confirmed.)\n\nA superheavy atomic nucleus is created in a nuclear reaction that combines two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the two react. The material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target, which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei. Two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough; normally, nuclei (all positively charged) repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion. The strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus; beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus. The energy applied to the beam nuclei to accelerate them can cause them to reach speeds as high as one-tenth of the speed of light. However, if too much energy is applied, the beam nucleus can fall apart.\n\nComing close enough alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse: when two nuclei approach each other, they usually remain together for approximately 10 seconds and then part ways (not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction) rather than form a single nucleus. This happens because during the attempted formation of a single nucleus, electrostatic repulsion tears apart the nucleus that is being formed. Each pair of a target and a beam is characterized by its cross section—the probability that fusion will occur if two nuclei approach one another expressed in terms of the transverse area that the incident particle must hit in order for the fusion to occur. This fusion may occur as a result of the quantum effect in which nuclei can tunnel through electrostatic repulsion. If the two nuclei can stay close for past that phase, multiple nuclear interactions result in redistribution of energy and an energy equilibrium.\n\nThe resulting merger is an excited state—termed a compound nucleus—and thus it is very unstable. To reach a more stable state, the temporary merger may fission without formation of a more stable nucleus. Alternatively, the compound nucleus may eject a few neutrons, which would carry away the excitation energy; if the latter is not sufficient for a neutron expulsion, the merger would produce a gamma ray. This happens in approximately 10 seconds after the initial nuclear collision and results in creation of a more stable nucleus. The definition by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) states that a chemical element can only be recognized as discovered if a nucleus of it has not decayed within 10 seconds. This value was chosen as an estimate of how long it takes a nucleus to acquire its outer electrons and thus display its chemical properties.\n\nThe beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber, the separator; if a new nucleus is produced, it is carried with this beam. In the separator, the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides (that of the original beam and any other reaction products) and transferred to a surface-barrier detector, which stops the nucleus. The exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked; also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival. The transfer takes about 10 seconds; in order to be detected, the nucleus must survive this long. The nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered, and the location, the energy, and the time of the decay are measured.\n\nStability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction. However, its range is very short; as nuclei become larger, its influence on the outermost nucleons (protons and neutrons) weakens. At the same time, the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons, and its range is not limited. Total binding energy provided by the strong interaction increases linearly with the number of nucleons, whereas electrostatic repulsion increases with the square of the atomic number, i.e. the latter grows faster and becomes increasingly important for heavy and superheavy nuclei. Superheavy nuclei are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to predominantly decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion: alpha decay and spontaneous fission. Almost all alpha emitters have over 210 nucleons, and the lightest nuclide primarily undergoing spontaneous fission has 238. In both decay modes, nuclei are inhibited from decaying by corresponding energy barriers for each mode, but they can be tunnelled through.\n\nAlpha particles are commonly produced in radioactive decays because mass of an alpha particle per nucleon is small enough to leave some energy for the alpha particle to be used as kinetic energy to leave the nucleus. Spontaneous fission is caused by electrostatic repulsion tearing the nucleus apart and produces various nuclei in different instances of identical nuclei fissioning. As the atomic number increases, spontaneous fission rapidly becomes more important: spontaneous fission partial half-lives decrease by 23 orders of magnitude from uranium (element 92) to nobelium (element 102), and by 30 orders of magnitude from thorium (element 90) to fermium (element 100). The earlier liquid drop model thus suggested that spontaneous fission would occur nearly instantly due to disappearance of the fission barrier for nuclei with about 280 nucleons. The later nuclear shell model suggested that nuclei with about 300 nucleons would form an island of stability in which nuclei will be more resistant to spontaneous fission and will primarily undergo alpha decay with longer half-lives. Subsequent discoveries suggested that the predicted island might be further than originally anticipated; they also showed that nuclei intermediate between the long-lived actinides and the predicted island are deformed, and gain additional stability from shell effects. Experiments on lighter superheavy nuclei, as well as those closer to the expected island, have shown greater than previously anticipated stability against spontaneous fission, showing the importance of shell effects on nuclei.\n\nAlpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles, and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay; if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus, the original product of a reaction can be easily determined. (That all decays within a decay chain were indeed related to each other is established by the location of these decays, which must be in the same place.) The known nucleus can be recognized by the specific characteristics of decay it undergoes such as decay energy (or more specifically, the kinetic energy of the emitted particle). Spontaneous fission, however, produces various nuclei as products, so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters.\n\nThe information available to physicists aiming to synthesize a superheavy element is thus the information collected at the detectors: location, energy, and time of arrival of a particle to the detector, and those of its decay. The physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed. Often, provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects; errors in interpreting data have been made.\n\nThe heaviest element known at the end of the 19th century was uranium, with an atomic mass of approximately 240 (now known to be 238) amu. Accordingly, it was placed in the last row of the periodic table; this fueled speculation about the possible existence of elements heavier than uranium and why \"A\" = 240 seemed to be the limit. Following the discovery of the noble gases, beginning with that of argon in 1895, the possibility of heavier members of the group was considered. Danish chemist Julius Thomsen proposed in 1895 the existence of a sixth noble gas with \"Z\" = 86, \"A\" = 212 and a seventh with \"Z\" = 118, \"A\" = 292, the last closing a 32-element period containing thorium and uranium. In 1913, Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg extended Thomsen's extrapolation of the periodic table to include even heavier elements with atomic numbers up to 460, but he did not believe that these superheavy elements existed or occurred in nature.\n\nIn 1914, German physicist Richard Swinne proposed that elements heavier than uranium, such as those around \"Z\" = 108, could be found in cosmic rays. He suggested that these elements may not necessarily have decreasing half-lives with increasing atomic number, leading to speculation about the possibility of some longer-lived elements at Z = 98–102 and Z = 108–110 (though separated by short-lived elements). Swinne published these predictions in 1926, believing that such elements might exist in the Earth's core, in iron meteorites, or in the ice caps of Greenland where they had been locked up from their supposed cosmic origin.\n\nWork performed from 1964 to 2013 at four laboratories – the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the USA, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the USSR (later Russia), the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, and RIKEN in Japan – identified and confirmed the elements from rutherfordium to oganesson according to the criteria of the IUPAC–IUPAP Transfermium Working Groups and subsequent Joint Working Parties. These discoveries complete the seventh row of the periodic table. The remaining two transactinides, ununennium (element 119) and unbinilium (element 120), have not yet been synthesized. They would begin an eighth period.\n\nDue to their short half-lives (for example, the most stable isotope of seaborgium has a half-life of 14 minutes, and half-lives decrease gradually going to the right of the group) and the low yield of the nuclear reactions that produce them, new methods have had to be created to determine their gas-phase and solution chemistry based on very small samples of a few atoms each. Relativistic effects become very important in this region of the periodic table, causing the filled 7s orbitals, empty 7p orbitals, and filling 6d orbitals to all contract inwards toward the atomic nucleus. This causes a relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons and makes the 7p orbitals accessible in low excitation states.\n\nElements 104 to 112, rutherfordium through copernicium, are nine of the ten elements that form the 6d series of transition elements: for elements 104–108 and 112, experimental evidence shows them to behave as expected for their position in the periodic table. They are expected to have ionic radii between those of their 5d transition metal homologs and their actinide pseudohomologs: for example, Rf is calculated to have ionic radius 76 pm, between the values for Hf (71 pm) and Th (94 pm). Their ions should also be less polarizable than those of their 5d homologs. Relativistic effects are expected to reach a maximum at the end of this series, at roentgenium (element 111) and copernicium (element 112). Nevertheless, many important properties of the transactinides are still not yet known experimentally, though theoretical calculations have been performed.\n\nElements 113 to 118, nihonium through oganesson, should form a 7p series, completing the seventh period in the periodic table. Their chemistry will be greatly influenced by the very strong relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons and a strong spin-orbit coupling effect \"tearing\" the 7p subshell apart into two sections, one more stabilized (7p, holding two electrons) and one more destabilized (7p, holding four electrons). Additionally, the 6d electrons are still destabilized in this region and hence may be able to contribute some transition metal character to the first few 7p elements. Lower oxidation states should be stabilized here, continuing group trends, as both the 7s and 7p electrons exhibit the inert pair effect. These elements are expected to largely continue to follow group trends, though with relativistic effects playing an increasingly larger role. In particular, the large 7p splitting results in an effective shell closure at flerovium (element 114) and a hence much higher than expected chemical activity for oganesson (element 118).\n\nElement 118 is the last element that has been claimed to have been synthesized. The next two elements, elements 119 and 120, should form an 8s series and be an alkali and alkaline earth metal respectively. The 8s electrons are expected to be relativistically stabilized, so that the trend towards higher reactivity down these groups will reverse direction and the elements will behave more like their period 5 homologs, rubidium and strontium. Nevertheless, the 7p orbital is still relativistically destabilized, potentially giving these elements larger ionic radii and perhaps even being able to participate chemically. In this region, the 8p electrons are also relativistically stabilized, resulting in a ground-state 8s8p valence electron configuration for element 121. Large changes are expected to occur in the subshell structure in going from element 120 to element 121: for example, the radius of the 5g orbitals should drop drastically, from 25 Bohr units in element 120 in the excited [Og] 5g 8s configuration to 0.8 Bohr units in element 121 in the excited [Og] 5g 7d 8s configuration, in a phenomenon called \"radial collapse\" that occurs at element 125. Element 122 should add a further 7d electron to element 121's electron configuration. Elements 121 and 122 should be similar to actinium and thorium, respectively.\n\nBeyond element 121, the superactinide series is expected to begin, when the 8s electrons and the filling 8p, 7d, 6f, and 5g subshells determine the chemistry of these elements. Complete and accurate calculations are not available for elements beyond 123 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should have about the same energy level, and in the region of element 160 the 9s, 8p, and 9p orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the block concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning these elements in a periodic table very difficult; element 164 is expected to mix characteristics of the elements of group 10, 12, and 18.\n\n\n"}

In France, Lenormand is considered the greatest cartomancer of all time, highly influential on the wave of French cartomancy that began in the late 18th century.\n\nLenormand was born on 27 May 1772 in Alençon, Normandy, to Jean Louis Antoine Lenormand, a draper, and Marie Anne Lenormand (née Gilbert). Lenormand was orphaned at the age of five and educated in a convent school. Lenormand left Alençon for Paris in 1786.\n\nLenormand claimed to have given cartomantic advice to many famous persons, among them leaders of the French revolution (Marat, Robespierre and St-Just), Empress Josephine and Tsar Alexander I. She was active for more than 40 years.\n\nIn 1814 Lenormand started a second literary career and published many texts, causing many public controversies. She was imprisoned more than once, though never for very long.\n\nLenormand died in Paris on 25 June 1843 and is buried in Division 3 of Père Lachaise Cemetery. She left behind a fortune of 500,000 Francs, and left no heirs other than a nephew who, at the time of her death, was in the army. A devout Catholic, her nephew burned all of Mme.

He was a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre (ABT) from 1997 till July 2012. He was the artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet from 2011 to 2014. His wife is Gillian Murphy, also a principal dancer with ABT.\n\nHe is the only son of a Lutheran minister who became a prison warden in New York; their last name is pronounced \"Stee-fell\" and is German for \"boot.\"\n\nStiefel began ballet training in Madison, Wisconsin at the Monona Academy of Dance at age eight. He became involved with classical dance through his older sister, who was taking a class. Before that, both he and his sister took gymnastics classes. His first ballet teacher, Jo Jean Retrum, was interested in getting Ethan to take class because boys in ballet are a rarity. He studied for two years at the Milwaukee Ballet School under Ted Kivitt and Paul Sutherland, and at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet before moving to New York City to attend the School of American Ballet on scholarship.\n\nWhile there, Stanley Williams enrolled him in the company's men's special class where he trained alongside Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Fernando Bujones. He studied with Baryshnikov himself at the short lived Mikhail Baryshnikov's School of Classical Ballet.\n\nHe started his dancing career in 1989, when he joined the corps de ballet of New York City Ballet at age 16. In 1992, he took a leave of absence to perform with the Zürich Ballet, under directorship of Bernd R. Bienert, but returned to NYCB a year later as a soloist. By 1995, he was a principal dancer with the company. He ended his tenure with NYCB in April 1997 when he joined ABT as a principal dancer, from which he retired in 2012. He danced with the short-lived Mikhail Baryshnikov School of Classical Ballet at ABT. His dance repertoire includes many key romantic roles in both classical and contemporary ballet.\n\nHe won a silver medal at the Prix de Lausanne in 1989 and also received a Princess Grace Foundation-USA grant in 1991. In 1998, Stiefel was nominated for the Benois de la Danse award as one of the rising stars in ballet. In 2007, Stiefel made his debut with the Australian Ballet in Nureyev's staging of \"Don Quixote\", for its Melbourne and Sydney seasons, in the role of Basilio. In 2008, Stiefel was a recipient of the Dance Magazine Award along with Pina Bausch, Sylvia Walters, and Lawrence Rhodes for his role as a leader in the dance field.\n\nStiefel has appeared as a guest artist with many companies throughout his career including the Mariinsky Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Australian Ballet, Zurich Ballet, Munich Ballet, Hamburg Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, New National Ballet in Tokyo, and Teatro Colón Ballet in Buenos Aires. He gave his final performance as an ABT principal dancer on July 7, 2012, at the Metropolitan Opera House, as Ali the slave in \"Le Corsaire\". He is widely considered right now to be currently \"the greatest male ballet dancer in the world or \"the most advanced male ballet dancer in the world\".\n\nIn 2004, he created a four-week workshop, Stiefel & Students, for aspiring dancers where dance students train and perform with professional ballet dancers. It is held annually on Martha's Vineyard in the month of August. The program accepts students aged 12 to 18. Its rollcall of star guest teachers include Stiefel, Johan Kobborg, Amanda McKerrow, Elizabeth Parkinson, Scott Wise, Marcelo Gomes, John Gardner, Gary Chryst, Ann Reinking, and Alina Cojocaru. The program has been on hiatus since 2008.\n\nIn late 2005, Ballet Pacifica, based in Irvine, California, named him as its artistic director with the aim to relaunch itself as a higher-profile ballet company. However, after the company failed to raise the funds necessary to support their new vision, its executive director resigned followed by Stiefel himself in April 2006.\n\nHe was formerly the dean of the School of Dance at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem where he also choreographed a new production of The Nutcracker.\n\nIn November 2010 Stiefel was announced as the next director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet. He took up that position in September 2011. Stiefel expanded the international profile of the company, programmed new works, created a one-act ballet Bierhalle, and choreographed a production of Giselle. In March 2014, Stiefel announced that he would not extend his contract with the Royal New Zealand Ballet and would return to the United States.\n\nIn 2000, he starred in the film \"Center Stage\", directed by Nicholas Hytner with original choreography by Susan Stroman and featuring Amanda Schull. He also starred in the sequels \"\" and \"\". \"Center Stage\" features a subplot in which Stiefel's character garners the financial support of a flirtatious female philanthropist (played by Elizabeth Hubbard). An article in \"The New York Times\" entitled \"How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?\" revealed that Stiefel has a similar real-life sponsorship relationship with wealthy philanthropist Anka Palitz.\n\nIn 2007 he appeared in the movie, \"Born to Be Wild - The Leading Men of American Ballet Theatre\" with Angel Corella, Jose Manuel Carreno and Vladimir Malakhov directed by Judy Kinberg and produced by Jodee Nimerichter.\n\nIn 2007, Stiefel appeared in an episode of \"Queer Eye\" to meet a \"straight guy\" who considers Stiefel his \"idol.\" In 2010 he appeared as himself in season 4, episode 8 of \"Gossip Girl\" with Murphy.\n\nHe is an avid motorcyclist. He grew up riding dirt bikes, currently owns a Harley-Davidson \"Wide Glide\" and once drove 3,500 miles across the north-eastern US with his (then) girlfriend Gillian Murphy riding pillion. He is also a Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers fan. \n\nStiefel proposed to Murphy, a principal dancer with the American Ballet Company, in May 2011, after they performed in ABT's spring gala. They were married on September 19 2015. On December 14, 2018, Murphy announced that she was pregnant with her first child and would take maternity leave for the 2018-2019 season.

As of 2016, seven people have been removed from the Order of Canada: Alan Eagleson, David Ahenakew, T. Sher Singh, Steve Fonyo, Garth Drabinsky, Conrad Black, and Ranjit Chandra. Eagleson was removed from the order after being jailed for fraud in 1998; Ahenakew was removed in 2005, after being convicted of promoting anti-Semitic hatred in 2002; Singh was removed after the revocation of his law licence for professional misconduct; Fonyo was removed due to numerous criminal convictions; Drabinsky was removed in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario; and Chandra was removed in 2015 for committing research fraud. The formal removal process is performed by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, though it can be initiated by any citizen of Canada.\n\nParagraph 25, section C, of the Constitution of the Order of Canada allows the Governor General of Canada to remove a person from the order by issuing an ordinance based on a decision of the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada. This decision is based on \"evidence and guided by the principle of fairness and shall only be made after the Council has ascertained the relevant facts relating to the case under conlideration.\"\n\nA member of the order can be removed for being convicted of a criminal offense, or if the conduct of the person deviates significantly from recognized standards and is seen as undermining the credibility, integrity, or relevance of the order.\n\nA member of the order can be removed if they have been subjected to an official sanction by an adjudicating body, professional association, or other organization. Official sanctions can include fines, reprimands, or disbarment (as was the case for Alan Eagleson and T. Sher Singh). However, the only punishment the advisory council can issue is removal from the Order of Canada.\n\nThe removal process begins by sending a written petition to the deputy secretary of the chancellery or by the deputy secretary initiating the process himself/herself. If the petition was started by a citizen, the claim could be judged as valid or invalid. If it is invalid, the deputy secretary will consult with the secretary general of the order and a letter will be sent to petitioner explaining their decision. If it is valid, the petition will be sent by the secretary general to the advisory council.\n\nThe advisory council now has the decision to either continue or to stop the removal process. If it stops, the secretary general will notify the petitioner. If the council sees reasonable grounds for the process to continue, the removal-nominee will go through the remainder of the removal process.\n\nThe secretary general will send a registered letter to the removal-nominee that allegations were filed against them and their status in the Order of Canada is under consideration by the advisory council. The letter also gives the removal-nominee the options of responding to the allegations or to resign from the order.\n\nIf the removal-nominee decides to leave the order on their own, they will notify the secretary general of their decision. If the removal-nominee decides to challenge the allegations, either they or their authorized representative will respond to the allegations within the time limit set in the notification letter. Whatever action the removal-nominee takes, the process will be handed back to the advisory council for further consideration. Once the advisory council has made their decision, they will send a report to the governor general explaining their findings and their recommendations. The governor general, following the recommendation of the advisory council, will either notify the person that they will remain in the order in good standing or issue an ordinance terminating a person's membership in the order. Once the ordinance has been published, the person must return all Order insignia to the secretary general of the order and their name will be removed from all records held by the chancellery. The former member also loses the right to use their post-nominal letters in their names and loses the use of the order motto, ribbon, and medal on their personal coat of arms.\n\nWhen the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador was created in 2001, it included a removal system modelled after that one used by the Order of Canada.\n\nAt the time of Ranjit Chandra's removal from the Order of Canada in 2015, there have been six other invididuals who were removed from the order.\n\nAlan Eagleson was appointed to the rank of Officer of the Order of Canada April 20, 1989, for his work in promoting the sport of ice hockey. While serving as the head of the National Hockey League Players Association, he was accused of defrauding players out of money. Other charges included racketeering, embezzlement, and obstruction of justice with 34 total charges in the United States and 8 in Canada.\n\nIn January 1998, Eagleson pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud in the US. In that same month, Eagleson was disbarred in Canada. In February, the Governor General at the time, Roméo LeBlanc, signed an ordinance that removed Eagleson from the order. Eagleson became the first person to be removed from the order.\n\nThe decision to terminate Eagleson's membership in the order was gazetted on March 14, 1998.\n\nDuring his sentencing in July 1998, Eagleson wore his Order of Canada lapel pin, despite the fact it was already stripped from him by that time. However, when asked to return the order, Eagleson did so within a week of the demand being made.\n\nDavid Ahenakew was appointed to the grade of Member in December 1978 for his longtime \"service to Indians and Métis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province.\"\n\nAhenakew first came under fire in 2002 after giving a profanity-laden speech. In this speech, Ahenakew called Jewish people \"a disease\". Ahenakew made taped comments to the \"Saskatoon StarPhoenix\" a few days after the speech that included \"That's how Hitler came in. That he was going to make damn sure that Jews weren't going to take over\", and \"That's why he fried six million of those guys.\" \n\nIn June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan justice department with willingly promoting hatred., but his removal from the order was put on hold until the legal dispute was finished.\n\nOn June 29, 2005, the order's Advisory Council began its formal revocation process, during a regularly scheduled semi-annual meeting. Ahenakew was informed, in writing, that he can either voluntarily resign, respond, or contest the possibility of revocation.\n\nUltimately, the council found that irrespective of the outcome of Ahenakew's legal proceedings, it brought disrepute to the order, and Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to issue an ordinance on July 11 to officially remove Ahenakew from the Order of Canada.\n\nThe decision to terminate Ahenakew's membership in the order was gazetted on July 30, 2005.\n\nT. Sher Singh received his Member of the Order of Canada in 2002, due to a record in public service. His appointment was terminated on December 10, 2008, after the Law Society of Upper Canada found him guilty of professional misconduct and revoked his licence to practise law. Among the allegations against Singh were that he failed to serve clients, mishandled trust funds, misappropriated $2,000 from a client, and continued to practise after being suspended in November 2005. His membership in the order was revoked on December 10, 2008.\n\nSteve Fonyo was the youngest person ever appointed as an Officer of the order in 1985. Following his appointment, however, Fonyo developed an addiction to cocaine. The advisory council considered removing him in 1995, following a criminal conviction related to his cocaine use, but did not move to strip him from the order.\n\nBy 1996, Fonyo had a number of run-ins with the law. He was accused of a number of offenses, including assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, fraud for writing bad checks to supermarkets, and domestic violence.\n\nFonyo was terminated from the order on December 10, 2009. The decision to terminate Fonyo's membership in the Order was gazetted on January 23, 2010, and announced by the Governor General's office two days later.\n\nGarth Drabinsky was a theatrical production mogul in Canada, responsible for numerous successful productions, most notably the long-running Toronto production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"The Phantom of the Opera\". He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1995. In 2009, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario and has been a fugitive from American law for related crimes. With the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling on March 29, 2012, not to hear his appeal or grant a new trial, Drabinsky has apparently exhausted his opportunities to have his convictions overturned and is serving the balance of his reduced sentence. On November 29, 2012, the Governor General signed an ordinance removing Drabinsky from the order. Drabinsky subsequently filed an application in the Federal Court of Canada to block his removal.\n\nMedia baron Conrad Black was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990. In 2001, following a conflict where then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien invoked the Nickle Resolution to prevent Black from being appointed a life peer, Black surrendered his Canadian citizenship, though he remained in the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2005, Black was arrested in the United States on multiple charges of mail and wire fraud. However, due to lengthy appeals, even as Black was serving a prison sentence, he still remained a member of the Order of Canada. In September 2011, after Black returned to prison due to the failure of his appeal, Rideau Hall confirmed that Black's appointment was under review by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, which has the power to recommend \"the termination of a person's appointment to the Order of Canada if the person has been convicted of a criminal offence.\" Black's requests for an oral hearing were denied by the advisory council and his application to federal court for an oral hearing to be required was dismissed. Black appealed the decision.\n\nIn an interview, Black intimated that he would rather resign from the order than be removed. \"I would not wait for giving these junior officials the evidently almost aphrodisiacal pleasure of throwing me out. I would withdraw,\" he told CBC's Susan Ormiston. \"In fact, I wouldn't be interested in serving.\"\n\nOn January 31, 2014, the Governor General at the time, David Johnston, announced that he had accepted a recommendation from an advisory council to remove Black from the Order of Canada. On the same day, the Governor General, acting on the recommendation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, also expelled Black from the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, to which he had been appointed in 1992. Black, however, maintained he resigned from the order the year prior.\n\nThe decision to terminate Black's membership from the order was gazetted on February 22, 2014.\n\nIn 2019 Conrad Black's American criminal record was pardoned by President Donald Trump\nRanjit Chandra was a research scientist and professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1989.\n\nIn 2006, CBC aired \"The Secret Life of Dr. Chandra.\", which alleged that research published by Chandra was fraudulent.\n\nIn 2015, a jury trial in which Chandra sued the CBC for libel found the contents of the documentary to be truthful. In that same year, the \"British Medical Journal\" retracted one of his papers, \"Influence of maternal diet during lactation and use of formula feeds on development of atopic eczema in high risk infants\", which was published in 1989, due to what was described as \"scientific misconduct\".\n\nRideau Hall revoked Chandra's appointment to the order on December 3, 2015, but the decision was only gazetted on January 9, 2016.\n\nResignations from the order can take place only through the prescribed channels, which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery of his or her desire to terminate their membership, and only with the governor general's approval can the resignation take effect.\n\nIf a member resigns, he or she must return all insignia and lose the use of the order motto, ribbon, and badge on their personal coat of arms.\n\nIn reaction to the decision to induct Henry Morgentaler into the order, a number of members in the order indicated they would return or had returned their emblems in protest, including Lucien Larré and former Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick Gilbert Finn. Larré's resignation was gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on February 25, 2010. As for Finn, he has never officially resigned for the order, as no news of his resignation has ever been gazetted.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, the Governor General at the time, Michaëlle Jean, announced that she has accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor René Racine, pianist Jacqueline Richard, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte. The resignations were directly attributed by media reports to the decision to induct Morgentaler. The three's resignations were gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on December 9, 2008. \n\nOn April 19, 2010, the resignation of Frank Chauvin, a retired fire-fighter who opened an orphanage in Haiti, was accepted. Chauvin's decision to resign from the order was also directly attributed by media reports to the decision to induct Morgentaler. Chauvin's resignation was gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on February 25, 2010. \n\nIn January 2013, the Governor General at the time, David Johnston, accepted the resignation of historian Camille Limoges. Limoges was named to the order in 2010, and reportedly resigned from all his honors out of a desire to live a simpler life.\n\nAt times, people resign from the order following a significant personal scandal. In July 2013, Bernard Norman Barwin's resignation from the order was approved by the Governor General, and gazetted a month later. Months prior, Barwin was reprimanded for inseminating women with the wrong sperm. It was later proven via DNA testing that Barwin had in fact inseminated numerous patient's with his own sperm rather than that of the intended father or approved sperm donor without authorization of the fertility patient.\n\nIn May 2014, Louis LaPierre left the order, after it was revealed that he misrepresented his academic credentials. Despite media reports that LaPierre was stripped of the order, and suggestions by at least one member of the order that LaPierre be stripped of the honour, the text used in the Canada Gazette notice on his leaving of the order, published in June 2014, were similar to those used in other resignations, and clearly states that the individual requested the removal.\n\nThe Constitution for the Order of Canada also allows for membership in the order to end when a member dies. When a member dies, the post-nominal letters may still be affixed to their name and their family may keep the insignia as family heirlooms.\n\nOrganizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House Apostolate have, on at least one occasion, returned Order of Canada insignias of deceased former members. However, since membership terminates with the death of the member, the return of the insignia has no effect on the composition of the order.\n\nThe first person \"removed\" from the order was considered by historian Christopher McCreery as more of a transfer of status than a removal.\n\nIn 1981, Zena Sheardown was appointed an honorary member of the Order of Canada. She was the wife of John Sheardown, a staff member at the Canadian embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution. At this time, the new regime did not recognize international laws regarding diplomatic immunity and allowed a group of students to take control of the US embassy and hold its staff members hostage. Several staff were not on site at this time and found refuge with the Canadian diplomatic contingent, the now famous Canadian Caper. At great personal risk, the Sheardowns personally housed four Americans in their home for months until they could be safely removed from the country. At this point, although married to a Canadian, Zena was awarded an honorary Order of Canada in 1981, due to her being a British subject via her Guyanan citizenship.\n\nBy 1986, Sheardown had become a naturalized Canadian, and Sheardown's honorary appointment was terminated, in exchange for an appointment as a full member.\n\n"}

The forest consists of , making it the third largest National Forest outside Alaska. The forest stretches from Yellowstone National Park, along the eastern boundary of Grand Teton National Park and from there rides along the western slope of the Continental Divide to the southern end of the Wind River Range. The forest also extends southward encompassing the Salt River Range and Wyoming Range mountains near the Idaho border.\n\nLocated within the forest are the Gros Ventre, Bridger and Teton Wildernesses, totaling . Other points of interest contained in the forest include Gannett Peak (13,804 ft/4,207 m), the tallest mountain in Wyoming, and the Gros Ventre landslide, which is one of the largest readily visible landslides on earth. All of the forest is in turn a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\nWhile Gannett Peak is the highest summit in the forest, another 40 named mountains rise above . The high altitudes and abundant snowfall, exceeding 600 inches (50 ft/15 m) at some locations, provides a constant supply of water for streams and rivers. 1,500 lakes also help provide water for the Yellowstone, Snake and Green rivers, which all have their headwaters in the forest. Seven of the largest glaciers outside of Alaska are located within the forest boundaries.\n\nU.S. Route 26 and U.S. Route 287 cross over the continental divide at Togwotee Pass and enter the forest from the north, and U.S. Highways 89 and 191 provide access to the forest in the vicinity of Jackson, Wyoming and forest lands to the south.\n\nThe primary tree species include lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, aspen and whitebark pine. Willows, grasses and sagebrush are found on the lower altitudes, while above the timberline alpine meadows are common. Threatened and endangered species found within the forest boundaries include grizzly bears, wolf, black-footed ferret and peregrine falcon. Most of the mammals that existed in the region prior to European settlement can still be found here. Elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, coyote, marmot, pronghorn, and cougar are but a few of the 75 species of mammals known to exist in the forest. Four subspecies of cutthroat trout also are found here including the Snake River cutthroat trout. 355 species of birds have been sighted including bald eagles, trumpeter swans, sandhill cranes, hawks, and Clark's nutcrackers.\n\nOver of hiking trails are located in the forest providing access into wilderness areas and interlinking with trails in Yellowstone National Park. There are several dozen vehicle accessible campgrounds that have picnic tables and tent sites as well as room in some circumstances for recreational vehicles. Nighttime temperatures can be below freezing any time of the year and mosquitos in the late spring and early summer are common. Summertime high temperatures average in the 70s and the wintertime lows can drop below -50 degrees.\n\nBridger–Teton National Forest is an administrative combination of Bridger and Teton National Forests, amalgamated in 1973. The Bridger National Forest itself absorbed Wyoming National Forest in 1923. The Wyoming National Forest had been created as the Yellowstone Forest Reserve in 1904, then renamed in 1908. The Teton Forest Reserve was created at the same time, destined to become Teton National Forest.\n\nRanger district offices are located in Pinedale, Kemmerer, Big Piney, Moran, Afton and Jackson. The forest headquarters is located in Jackson. In descending order of land area the forest is located in parts of Sublette, Teton, Lincoln, Park, and Fremont counties.\n\n"}

With the possibility of oil discovery within the \"Neutral Zone\" itself, concessions were granted in 1948–1949 by each government to private companies. Later the two countries exploited the oil under a joint operating agreement.\n\nIn 1957, Saudi Arabia signed a concession agreement with the Japanese-owned Arab Oil Co., and Kuwait signed in 1958. That concession expired in 2000.\n\nThe partitioning negotiations commenced shortly after the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia met and decided, in October 1960, that the Neutral Zone should be divided. On 7 July 1965, the two governments signed an agreement (which took effect on 25 July 1966) to partition the Neutral Zone adjoining their respective territories. A demarcation agreement dividing the Neutral Zone was signed on 17 December 1967 but did not formally take effect until the exchange of instruments and signing which took place in Kuwait on 18 December 1969. Ratification followed on 18 January 1970, and the agreement was published in the \"Kuwaiti Official Gazette\" on 25 January 1970.\n\nThe zone was never assigned an ISO 3166 code since it was partitioned before the adoption of ISO 3166 in 1974.\n\nSaudi and Coalition forces repelled Iraqi forces when they breached this area in 1991\n\nDespite the zone being half-century gone, oil pumping is still done by agreements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2231117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231117", "title": "François Francoeur", "text": "François Francoeur\n\nFrançois Francœur (8 September 1698 – 5 August 1787) was a French composer and violinist.\n\nFrançois Francœur was born in Paris, the son of Joseph Francœur, a basse de violon player and member of the \"24 violons du roy\". Francœur was instructed in music by his father and joined the Académie Royale de Musique as a violinist at age 15. After travel and performances in the principal European culture centres, he returned to Paris as a member of the Concert Spirituel. Francœur was appointed to the \"24 violons du roy\" in 1730 and \"Maître de musique\" (music instructor) to the Opera in 1739.\n\nIn 1744, he and François Rebel, his lifelong colleague and friend, were appointed \"inspecteurs musicaux\" (music directors) of the Paris Opéra—centre of the French music world—becoming responsible for all phases of its management in 1757. Rebel and Francœur faced numerous challenges in their joint roles, including a large financial deficit, lack of discipline, as well as handling contentious disagreements between traditionalists who favored French operatic tragedies and its mythological themes versus partisans of Italian opera's simpler lyricism and contemporary subject matter, known as the \"Querelle des Bouffons\".\n\nKing Louis XV appointed Francœur as his Music Master in 1760, ennobling Rebel in the same year and Francœur himself in May 1764. Disaster struck when the Paris Opéra was consumed in flames on 6 April 1763, and the two directors were forced to resign in 1767 in its aftermath. However, Louis XV asked Rebel to return to the Opéra as \"Administrateur général\" in 1772, a position he held until shortly before his death three years later. Francœur resigned himself from the music world, living in retirement until his own death in 1787 at age 89. He was thus spared the fate of his nephew, Louis-Joseph Francœur, Master of the King's Chamber music and orchestra director, who was imprisoned during the French Revolution until the fall of Robespierre in 1794.\n\nHis surviving compositions, published in \"Propyläen der Musik, V. 2\" (1989), include two books of violin sonatas, 10 operas (including one about the life of Skanderbeg) and some ballets, created jointly with François Rebel. Thus he is often quoted as a relatively rare case of collaboration in musical composition. A sicilienne and rigaudon were initially attributed to him, in a publication by Fritz Kreisler, but were eventually revealed to be the work of Kreisler himself.\n\nRecordings of Francœur's works include a noteworthy LP, \"Music for the Wedding of the Count d'Artois\", on the Musical Heritage label, and the Cypres CD 1626 \"Suites de Simphonies\", including what may be the same set of works by Francœur. Hugo Reyne and La Simphonie du Marais also recorded the \"Symphonies pour le Festin Royal du Comte d'Artois\". There is a 2003 recording of Francœur's Sonata in E for Cello and Piano on Delos by Zuill Bailey which shows off this composer to advantage. The opera \"Pirame et Thisbe\", a collaborative work with Rebel, was released in 2008, and \"Zélindor, Roi des Sylphes\" and \"Le Trophée\" were released in 2009.\n\nEspecial emphasis is placed on the above recordings for musicological as well as aesthetic reasons. In the transition from ages relatively little interested in earlier music (19th and early 20th century) to an age where a professional specialization in \"ancient music\" has arisen, composers like Francœur, who had relatively modest instrumental production or did not in other ways attract special professional attention, have often remained in obscurity. It is easy to see from Francœur's inventiveness and infectious rhythmic drive why he was esteemed in his lifetime. Had Louis XVI had him as a music instructor earlier in his life, instead of, as biographers suggest, a musical mediocrity who chilled his interest in the violin, he might have become a royal composer like Frederick the Great of Prussia.\n\nFrancœur is sometimes categorised amongst the \"Classical-era\" composers who avoided the \"classical style of Haydn and Mozart\". The surviving music of Francœur (supposedly composed close to 1773), though contemporary with that of Haydn and Mozart, shows relatively few of the courtly mannerisms that abound in classical music directly sponsored by royalty. Rather, it has more of an \"advanced Rococo\" character, spicing strings with creative use of wind instruments. This kind of music seems to have been especially favoured by the rising bourgeoisie and lesser aristocracy in mercantile centres like London, Hamburg, Frankfurt as well as Paris, who provided an increasing market for musical composition.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also credited with ushering in a new era for male ballet in America, thanks to his appearance in the iconic 2002 documentary \"Born to be Wild\" and successful franchise show \"Kings of the Dance\". \"The New York Times\" said Corella gave \"classical dancing, especially in the 19th-century repertory, a new image.\"\n\nHaving appeared on the front cover of \"The New York Times\" on various occasions, he is described as a \"a dancer capable of turning performance into sensation\" and as a \"force of nature\" by the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nAfter performing at the Kennedy Center Honors for the third time in 2014 he was made an official member of the artistic committee. He is the most featured dancer of the American Ballet Theatre in DVD recordings and his appearance as Prince Siegfried in the PBS presentation of \"Swan Lake\" won an Emmy Award.\n\nCorella is the only dancer with a statue in the \"Madrid Wax Museum\", and has both a secondary school and dance museum named after him. He has also been a judge on the Spanish version of the popular television show \"Mira Quien Baila\".\n\nOn 22 July 2014, the Pennsylvania Ballet announced that Corella has been appointed as its artistic director.\n\nBorn and raised in Madrid, Corella trained with Karemia Moreno and Víctor Ullate and began winning dance awards at a young age, including the First Prize in the National Ballet Competition of Spain in 1991 and three years later, the Grand Prix and Gold Medal at the Concours International de Danse de Paris.\n\nWhen the world-renowned Russian ballerina Natalia Makarova saw the young Corella in competition, she contacted the artistic director of American Ballet Theatre and recommended that he be auditioned for the company. She described him later to the publication \"Dance Magazine\" as \"exceptionally incredible… he is an angel who has been sent to us.\" He was accepted into ABT as a soloist in April 1995 and was promoted the following year (August 1996) to the rank of principal dancer.\n\nÁngel Corella has performed as a guest artist with such companies as The Royal Ballet in London, the La Scala Ballet in Milan, the New York City Ballet, the Australian Ballet, the Ballet of Tokyo, the Asami Maki Ballet, Ballet Contemporaneo de Caracas, the National Ballet of Chile and the Kirov Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn recent years Corella has danced for an array of world leaders including Queen Elizabeth II of England, Queen Sofía of Spain, Princess Letizia of Spain, the Duchess of Alba and United States Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He has on several occasions been a guest at the White House.\n\nIn 2006, Corella established the touring show \"Kings of the Dance\" alongside fellow leading men Gudrun Bojesen of The Royal Danish Ballet; Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet; Ethan Stiefel of ABT; and Nikolay Tsiskaridze of the Bolshoi Ballet. which premiered, at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, CA, immediately followed by an East Coast premiere at City Center. In 2007, \"Kings of the Dance\" toured to Russia with performances in St. Petersburg, Moscow, ad Perm, Russia. The next year, Angel Corella was the sole returning original cast member to perform it at the Mariinsky Festival. Since its inception, the franchise has been continued by various other dancers.\n\nCorella also devised an annual touring group entitled \"Angel Corella and stars of American Ballet\" which performed throughout Spain for seven years.\n\nCorella has also collaborated for gala performances with a variety of artists including actress Bette Midler, violinist Ara Malikian as well as opera singers Cecilia Bartoli and Ainhoa Arteta.\n\nAfter having danced in the operatic production \"La Gioconda\" at New York's Metropolitan Opera House, Barcelona's Liceu opera house, Madrid's Teatro Real and the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome, Corella made his debut with the Paris Opera in 2013.\n\nHe has had the opportunity to partner many well-known ballerinas including Alessandra Ferri, Xiomara Reyes, Julie Kent, Gillian Murphy, Diana Vishneva, Alina Cojocaru, Nina Ananiashvili, Paloma Herrera, Irina Dvorovenko, Viktoria Tereshkina, Alina Somova, Evgenia Obraztsova, Alexandra Ansanelli, Michele Wiles, Stella Abrera, Letizia Giuliani, Leanne Benjamin and Lucia Lacarra, among others.\n\nEncouraging of young professionals, he is a regular judge at several prestigious dance competitions such as the International Ballet and Choreography competition (Beijing) and has also taught at the various summer programs and leading dance schools including the Royal Ballet School in London.\n\nThroughout his career Angel Corella has won the respect of both the notorious New York critics and international publications due to both his technical capabilities and artistic prowess.\n\nIn Corella's debut year with American Ballet Theatre, during a performance of Twyla Tharp's \"Americans We\", \"The New York Times\" praised Corella's performance saying the ballet \"explodes with this young dancer’s phenomenal bravura. Don’t miss him.\" Increasing interest from audience and critics alike led quickly to more demanding principal roles. In his debut as the lead in the epic ballet La Bayadere the critic read \"Angel Corella was nothing short of perfect.\"\n\nDescribed as a virtuoso for his trademark feats of endurance \"extremely fast pirouettes suddenly speeding up rather than slowing down\" Corella excelled in the most demanding roles of the classical repertoire. Upon reviewing his first performance in Le Corsaire, \"The New York Times\" said \"This performance bought the house down!\" The newspaper also praised his versatility \"Mr Corella is the rare dancer who has performed magnificently in each part he has been given.\"\n\nRemarking on his artistic flair, the \"New York Times\" described Corella as a \"highly sophisticated artist\" referencing his \"finely nuanced acting\" and stated that \"the young Spaniard could wow audiences with multiple pirouettes, but it was his joy of dance that carried the day.\"\n\nIt was cited that Corella was often \"the star - and the heart of the show\" frequently causing the audience to erupt into \"feverish applause\" and that \"by sheer force, he put the company one step ahead,\"\n\nIn the year of his retirement from the American Ballet Theatre, \"The New York Times\" wrote \"Dancers like Angel Corella are hard to come by, and that speaks to more than just the radiance of his technique. He’s generous with his talent too.\"\n\n\nCorella's global success has on occasion allowed for him to appear in mainstream popular culture.\n\nIn 1998 a young Corella appeared on the long-running children's television show \"Sesame Street\". After chatting with the likes of Elmo, Corella danced a rendition of the alphabet.\n\nIn 2006 Corella appeared alongside Gwyneth Paltrow in the big-budget Christmas commercial for the luxury cava Freixenet. He was also the sole performer in the 2008 multi media campaign for Rolex, for which he was the Spanish ambassador for several years.\n\nCorella has represented high fashion designers such as Loewe, as well as popular dance brands such as Bloch and Sansha. He has also featured in the magazines \"Vogue\", \"Vanity Fair\", \"W\", \"GQ\" and \"Men's Health\" which recognised him as one of 2007's Men of the Year.\n\nIn 2014 Corella was a judge on the Spanish version of the American hit TV show \"Dancing with the Stars\". Which ran for a total of fourteen weeks and averaged a weekly audience of three million viewers.\n\nCorella has also appeared on a variety of talk shows in the United States including Charlie Rose and Jay Leno, as well as many Spanish entertainment programs like \"Buena Fuente\", \"Sorpresa Sorpresa\" and \"Quien Vive Aqui\".\n\nUpon his retirement from ABT in 2012, Corella performed to a sell out audience at the Metropolitan Opera House and received a standing ovation lasting over twenty minutes. \"The New Yorker\" commemorated the occasion by caricaturing the artist. The arts journal wrote \"For a long and happy time, we thought of Angel Corella, a much adored star of American Ballet theatre, simply as a king of dance. Now we are coming to know him as a native son.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2008, Corella established the first classical ballet company in Spain in 20 years, the Corella Ballet, Castilla y Leon; in February 2012, it moved to Barcelona and became the Barcelona Ballet.\n\nThe company had its world premiere in La Granja, Segovia, Spain on 11 July 2008 performing a mixed program of Clark Tippet's \"Bruch Violin Concerto\", Stanton Welch's \"Clear\" and Twyla Tharp's \"In the Upper Room\". Its first full-length ballet was \"La Bayadère\" (staging by Natalia Makarova) on 4 September 2008 at the Teatro Real in Madrid, Spain.\n\nBarcelona Ballet has since gone on to expand its repertoire and gain a great following across both Spain and the rest of the world. They are a touring company performing in many theatres across Spain, including Teatro Real, Madrid and the Liceu, Barcelona. They have performed internationally at the New York City Center in March 2010 as well as at the Los Angeles Music Center and Santa Barbara, California.

He was First Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration from 1999 to 2011, during which time he was often viewed as the main ideologist of the Kremlin who proposed and implemented the concept of sovereign democracy in Russia. From December 2011 until May 2013, Surkov served as the Russian Federation's Deputy Prime Minister. After his resignation, Surkov returned to the Presidential Executive Office and became a personal adviser of Vladimir Putin on relationships with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine. He was fired from this duty by presidential order in February 2020.\n\nSurkov is perceived by many to be a key figure with much power and influence in the administration of Vladimir Putin. According to \"The Moscow Times\", this perception is not dependent on the official title Surkov might hold at any one time in the Putin government. BBC documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis credits Surkov's blend of theater and politics with keeping Putin, and Putin's chosen successors, in power since 2000.\n\nJournalists in Russia and abroad have speculated that Surkov writes under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky, although the Kremlin denies it.\n\nAccording to Surkov's official biography and birth certificate, he was born 21 September 1964 in Solntsevo, Lipetsk Oblast, Russian SFSR. As per other statements, he was born in 1962 in Shali, Checheno-Ingush ASSR. His birth name is sometimes reported to be Aslambek Dudayev. His parents, the ethnic Russian Zinaida Antonovna Surkova (born 1935) and the ethnic Chechen Yuriy (\"Andarbek\") Danil'bekovich Dudayev (1942-2014), were school teachers in Duba-yurt, Checheno-Ingush ASSR. Following the separation of his parents, his mother moved to Lipetsk and he was baptized into Eastern Orthodox Christianity. In an interview published in June 2005 in the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\", Surkov stated that his father was ethnic Chechen and that he spent the first five years of his life in Chechnya, in Duba-yurt and Grozny. Surkov has claimed to be a relative of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1983, Surkov attended MISiS, but did not graduate from it. From 1983 to 1985, Surkov served in a Soviet artillery regiment in Hungary, according to his official biography. However, former Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov stated in a 2006 TV interview that Surkov served in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) during the same time period.\n\nAfter his military training, Surkov was accepted to Moscow Institute of Culture for a five-year program in theater direction, but spent only three years there. Surkov graduated from Moscow International University with a master's degree in economics in the late 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1980s, when the government lifted the ban against private businesses, Surkov started out in business. In 1987, he became head of the advertising department of Mikhail Khodorkovsky's businesses. From 1991 to April 1996, he held key managerial positions in advertising and PR departments of Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep. From March 1996 to February 1997, he was at Rosprom, and since February 1997 with Mikhail Fridman's Alfa-Bank.\n\nIn September 2004, Surkov was elected president of the board of directors of the oil products transportation company Transnefteproduct, but was instructed by Russia's prime minister Mikhail Fradkov to give up the position in February 2006.\n\nAfter a brief career as a director for public relations on the Russian television ORT channel from 1998 to 1999, Surkov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the President of the Russian Federation in 1999.\n\nDuring the beginning of his time in this role, Surkov's main appearances in public and in international media were as a public relations mouthpiece of the Kremlin. In August 2000, he confirmed that Gazprom would buy Vladimir Gusinsky's Media-Most, which at the time owned the only independent, nationwide Russian television channel, NTV. In September 2002, he stated on behalf of the Kremlin that they had decided not to return the statue of KGB founder Felix Dzerzhinsky that had been torn down during the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the 2003 Russian Duma elections, when the president's United Russia party got the most seats at 37.6%, Surkov delivered the Kremlin's enthusiastic response, saying \"We are living in a new Russia now.\"\n\nIn March 2004, he was additionally appointed as aide to the president.\n\nSince 2006, Surkov has advocated a political doctrine he has called sovereign democracy, to counter democracy promotion conducted by the USA and European states. Judged by some Western media as controversial, this view has not generally been shared by Russian media and the Russian political elite. Surkov sees this concept as a national version of the common political language that will be used when Russia talks to the outside world. As the most influential ideologist of \"sovereign democracy\", Surkov gave two programmatic speeches in 2006: \"Sovereignty is a Political Synonym of Competitiveness\" in February and \"Our Russian Model of Democracy is Titled Sovereign Democracy\" in June 2006.\nOn 8 February 2007, Moscow State University marked the 125th anniversary of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birth with a high-level conference \"Lessons of the New Deal for Modern Russia and the World\" attended, among others, by Surkov and Gleb Pavlovsky. Surkov drew an explicit parallel between Roosevelt and Russian president Putin, praising the legacy of Roosevelt's New Deal, and between the US of the 1930s and present-day Russia. Pavlovsky called on Putin to follow Roosevelt in staying for a third presidential term.\n\nAccording to \"The Moscow Times\", Surkov exerted his influence to have Ramzan Kadyrov appointed as acting Head of the Chechen Republic on 15 February 2007. Since this appointment, Kadyrov has gone on to serve two terms in office and has been accused of numerous humans rights abuses.\n\nIn October 2009, Surkov warned that opening and modernization of Russia's political system, a need repeatedly stressed by President Dmitry Medvedev, could result in more instability, which \"could rip Russia apart\".\n\nIn September 2011, Mikhail Prokhorov quit the Right Cause party, which he had led for five months. He condemned the party as a puppet of the Kremlin and named Surkov the \"main puppet master of the political process\" (), according to a report in Russian-language magazine \"Korrespondent\" picked up by \"The New York Times\". Prokhorov had hoped that Surkov would be fired from the Kremlin, but the Kremlin stood behind Surkov and said he would not disappear from the political stage. At that time, \"Reuters\" described Surkov in a profile as the Kremlin's 'shadowy chief political strategist', one of the most powerful men in the Kremlin and considered a close ally of then-Prime Minister Putin.\n\nOn 28 December 2011, Medvedev reassigned Surkov to the role of \"Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Modernisation\" in a move interpreted by many to be fallout from the controversial Russian parliamentary elections of 2011. At that time, Surkov described his past career as follows: \"I was among those who helped Boris Yeltsin to secure a peaceful transfer of power; among those who helped President Putin stabilize the political system; among those who helped President Medvedev liberalize it. All the teams were great.\"\nDuring this time, Surkov helped create some pro-government youth movements, including Nashi. He met with their leaders and participants several times and gave them lectures on the political situation. Nashi has been compared by Edward Lucas as the Putin government's version of the Soviet-era Komsomol.\n\nSince Putin's return to the presidency in 2012, Surkov became marginalized as Putin \"pursued a path of open repression over the cunning manipulation favoured by Surkov\". As a Deputy Prime Minister, Surkov criticized the Kremlin's Investigative Committee, which led investigations into opposition leaders, rather than the general prosecutor's office. The Committee stated he offered to resign on 7 May 2013, whereas Surkov stated he offered to resign on 28 April 2013. Putin signed it on 8 May 2013.\n\nDuring Putin's first two terms as president, Surkov was regarded as the Kremlin's \"grey cardinal\", due to crafting Russia's system of \"sovereign democracy\" and directing its propaganda principally through control of state run television. On 20 September 2013, Vladimir Putin appointed Surkov as his Aide in the Presidential Executive Office. He also became Putin's personal adviser on relationships with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine.\nOn 17 March 2014, the day after the Crimean status referendum, Surkov became one of the first eleven persons who were placed under executive sanctions on the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN) by President Barack Obama, freezing his assets in the US and banning him from entering the United States. Surkov responded to this by saying: \"The only things that interest me in the US are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock. I don’t need a visa to access their work.\"\n\nOn 21 March 2014, the European Union (EU) placed Surkov on its sanction list barring him from entering the EU and freezing his assets in the EU.\n\nIn February 2015, Ukrainian authorities accused Surkov of organizing snipers to kill protesters and police during the Ukrainian Euromaidan in January 2014. This accusation was dismissed by the Russian government as \"absurd\".\n\nDespite being barred from entering the EU, Surkov visited Greece's Mount Athos as a part of Putin's delegation to the holy site in May 2016.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, Surkov published in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta article \"The Long State of Putin\", which describes the main points of the term \"Putinism\" proposed by him. The article caused a stir in the media.\n\nIn February 2020, Surkov was removed from his role of advisor. On 26 February 2020, he gave an interview to \"Aktualnyie kommentarii\" where he stated that he actually resigned from the post on his own initiative and the reasons were correctly disclosed by Russian journalists Vladimir Solovyev and Alexei Venediktov. Surkov added that he was primarily involved with Donbass and Ukraine, but since the \"context\" has changed he decided to leave. He also stated that \"coercion to fraternal relations by force is the only method that has historically proven its effectiveness in the Ukrainian direction. I do not think that some other will be invented\".\n\nIn October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta released over a gigabyte of emails and other documents alleged to belong to Surkov. The 2,337 emails belonged to the inbox of Surkov's office email account, prm_surkova@gov.ru. The Kremlin suggested that the leaked documents were fake.\n\nThe emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine. The document release included a document sent by Denis Pushilin, former Chair of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic, listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to  6 June 2014. It also included a 22-page outline of \"a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev.\"\n\nBefore the 2010 U.S.-Russia \"Civil Society to Civil Society\" (C2C) summit, a U.S. House of Representatives representative for the state of Florida's 27th district, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), was the lead signatory of a written petition which called upon the Obama administration to suspend U.S. participation in the summit until Surkov was replaced as a delegate for the Russian side. In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Ros-Lehtinen explained that she objected to Surkov's attendance as she views him as \"one of the main propagators of limiting freedom of speech in Russia, intimidating Russian journalists and representatives of opposition political parties\". However, the summit went ahead despite her objections. A 2007 Open Source Center \"Media Aid\" document identifies the Russian \"ura.ru\" information website as reportedly having links to Surkov.\n\nInside Russia, Surkov has drawn criticism from activists and opposition groups: In September 2010, Lyudmila Alexeyeva appealed to then-president Dmitry Medvedev to dismiss him. Opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov (Solidarnost), Vladimir Milov (Democratic Choice), and Vladimir Ryzhkov (People's Freedom Party) jointly demanded his resignation over policies perceived to threaten freedom of the press and journalists in Russia. Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, who played a key role in the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, referred to Surkov as a \"notorious\" person who \"focuses only on destruction...as in South Ossetia and other regions where he focused on looting rather than aide\" ().\n\nIn 2013, Surkov was characterized by \"The Economist\" as the engineer of \"a system of make-believe\", \"a land of imitation political parties, stage-managed media and fake social movements\".\n\nIn Western media outside Russia, a vocal and eloquent critic of Surkov and of the administration of Vladimir Putin in general has been Peter Pomerantsev. Pomerantsev has written op-eds in \"The Atlantic\", \"The New York Times\", and the \"London Review of Books\" accusing Surkov, \"Putin's chief ideologue\" with \"unsurpassed influence over Russian politics\", of turning Russia into a \"managed democracy\", and of reducing Russian politics to nothing but \"postmodernist theatre\". In a talk before the Legatum Institute, Pomerantsev, along with Pavel Khodorkovsky, termed Russia a \"postmodern dictatorship\".\n\nOn 13 August 2009, Russian business newspaper \"Vedomosti\" reported that an anonymous source told them that a recently released novel, \"Close to Zero\" (\"\"), was written by Surkov under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky () in the magazine Russian Pioneer (). It was soon realized that the pseudonym is almost identical to the name of Surkov's second and current wife, Natalya Dubovitskaya ().\n\nIn a subsequent edition of \"Close to Zero\", Surkov would write a preface to it under his real name, but would continue to deny writing the main text. In the preface, Surkov writes two seemingly contradictory statements: \"The author of this novel is an unoriginal Hamlet-obsessed hack\"; and, \"this is the best book I have ever read\". Furthermore, the debut performance of the theatrical version of the novel, directed by Kirill Serebrennikov, was attended by Surkov.\n\nThe novel, which has the English language subtitle \"gangsta fiction\", has as its protagonist a man by the name of Yegor Samokhodov. Samokhodov's occupation is public relations, and he is tasked with managing the reputation of a regional governor. First, he hires a writer to ghostwrite a piece of poetry to be published under the name of the governor without disclosing the ghostwriting, so that the governor may win an award and seem clever to his constituents. He then bribes a newspaper reporter to \"correct\" stories that portray the governor negatively, such as allegations that a factory of a relative of his is releasing chemicals into the air that harm local children. The publishing houses and public relations firms in the novel are intensely violent, with each company having its own gang and turf wars being fought over the rights to publish or represent such acclaimed Russian authors as Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Nabokov. Peter Pomerantsev described the book as \"exactly the sort of book Surkov's youth groups burn on Red Square.\" \"The Economist\" wrote that the novel \"expos[ed] the vices of the system [Surkov] himself had created\".\n\nOther works authored under the name Nathan Dubovitsky, all published in Russian Pioneer, that are rumored to be the work of Surkov are:\n\nSome outside Russia, such as Ned Reskinoff of ThinkProgress, and Adam Curtis in the BBC documentary \"HyperNormalisation\", have claimed that Surkov's unique blend of politics and theatre have begun to affect countries outside of Russia, most notably the United States with the selection of Donald Trump for the 2016 US Republican nomination and Trump's subsequent campaign and election victory.\n\nIn an editorial for the \"London Review of Books\" quoted by Curtis, Peter Pomerantsev describes Putin's Russia thus:\n\nCurtis claims that Trump used a similar strategy to become president of the United States, and hints that Trump's Surkovian origins caused Putin to express his admiration for Trump in Russian media.\n\nSurkov has boasted that \"Russia is playing with the West’s minds\", \"They don't know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.\"\n\nSurkov has married twice. His first marriage, to Yulia Petrovna Vishnevskaya (, née Lukoyanova, Лукоянова) in 1987, ended in divorce in 1996. In his second marriage, Surkov married Natalya Dubovitskaya, his secretary when he was an executive at the Menatep bank, in a civil ceremony in 1998. Surkov has four children: Artem (; born 1987), the biological child of Yulia he adopted during his first marriage; and Roman (; born 2002), Maria (; born 2004), and Timur (; born 2010), biological children of himself and Natalya.\n\nSurkov has composed songs and written texts for the Russian rock-musician Vadim Samoylov, ex-member of the band Agata Kristi (). He speaks English and is fond of poets of the Beat Generation such as Allen Ginsberg.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the first stage of the Finnish War, the Swedish commander Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor had decided to retreat from southern Finland, so that the Swedes would gain time, and more troops could be moved to Finland via Tornio. The retreat was also made in an effort to delay battles until the seas thawed, and to reserve troops in case the Danes took the opportunity to attack Sweden.\n\nThe Battle of Pyhäjoki, which had been fought two days earlier, was one of the first skirmishes of the war, but Siikajoki was the first major attempt to stop the advancing Russians. Carl Johan Adlercreutz had been appointed commander after Count Gustaf Karl Fredrik Löwenhjelm had been captured by the Russian at Pyhäjoki. The force commanded by Georg Carl von Döbeln was trying to cross the Siikajoki River when the Russians caught up with his force. Von Döbeln decided to take a stance on the south bank of the river. He first ordered a counterattack, but was forced to pull back. At that point the Russian center opened up and the newly appointed General-Adjutant Adlercreutz ordered another attack, which threw the Russians back and halted their advance.\n\nThe Battle of Siikajoki is described in the poem \"Adlercreutz\" in Runeberg's epic \"Tales of Ensign Stål\".\n\nThe Nyland Regiment distinguished themselves at the battle, and today the Siikajoki Cross can be worn by soldiers of the Nyland Brigade, which is the traditional heir, though now part of the Finnish Navy.\n"}
{"id": "2231127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231127", "title": "Vitis riparia", "text": "Vitis riparia\n\nVitis riparia Michx, with common names riverbank grape or frost grape, is a vine indigenous to North America. As a climbing or trailing vine, it is widely distributed across central and eastern Canada and the central and northeastern parts of the United States, from Quebec to Texas, and eastern Montana to Nova Scotia. There are reports of isolated populations in the northwestern USA, but these are probably naturalized. It is long-lived and capable of reaching into the upper canopy of the tallest trees. It produces dark fruit that are appealing to both birds and people, and has been used extensively in commercial viticulture as grafted rootstock and in hybrid grape breeding programs.\n\n\"Riverbank grape\" is a translation of the scientific name \"Vitis riparia\"; means \"of riverbanks\" in Latin, deriving from \"riverbank\".\n\nMature vines have loose, fissured bark, and may attain several inches in diameter. Leaves are alternate, often with opposite tendrils or inflorescences, coarsely toothed, long and broad, sometimes with sparse hairs on the underside of veins.\n\n\"V. riparia\" is functionally dioecious. The inflorescence is a panicle long and loose, and the flowers are small, fragrant, and white or greenish in color. \"V. riparia\" blooms sometime between April and June and in August or September produces a small blue-black berry (grape) with a bloom, seeded, juicy, edible, vinous in flavor, lacking the \"foxy\" characteristics of \"Vitis labrusca\", but usually quite sour and herbaceous. \"V. riparia\" has a wide range and may deviate considerably in detail from the above general description. White berries, perfect flowers, large clusters, large berries, and sweet fruit are among the known variations. However, some observers consider such variations as evidence of natural hybridization with other species of grapes.\n\n\"Vitis riparia\" has the largest geographical range of any of the North American Vitis species. It is present across nearly the entire eastern half of North America, from southern Quebec, to Piedmont, Alabama, and the Carolinas \nbut absent of the coastal plains and the westerner parts of North America of the great plains. Variants of the species have been observed as far north as Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba, Canada and as far west as Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota.\n\nIn the wild, the vine thrives along exposed areas with good sun exposure and adequate soil moisture, such as riverbanks, forest clearings, fence lines and along road sides. The species has adapted to a variety of soil chemistries.\n\nSome \"V. riparia\" vines have been known to withstand temperatures as low as . The foliage is typically resistant to mildew and black rot, and the roots resistant to phylloxera. The berries, however, are often sensitive to mildew and black rot if the vine is exposed to prolonged wet and humid conditions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant agricultural usage of \"V. riparia\" is as grafted rootstock for Vitis vinifera. Important advantages of the use of \"V. riparia\" (and hybrids between it and other Vitis species) include resistance to phylloxera and adaptation to variant soil types.\n\nDue to the extensive cold hardiness and fungal disease resistance of this species, it has been used extensively in grape breeding programs to transfer cold hardy and disease resistant genes to domesticated grapes. The French-American hybrid grapes are notable examples of these attempts. \"V. riparia\" has been used extensively for over a hundred years to create hardy hybrids. Many \"V. riparia\" hybrids are currently being used and investigated by plant breeders and in breeding programs such as those conducted by the University of Minnesota's horticulture program in an effort to make a commercially viable wine grape that can survive the northern climate of the Upper Midwest. Examples of commercially important cultivars with significant \"V. Riparia\" ancestry include Baco noir, Marechal Foch, Triomphe d'Alsace and Frontenac.\n\nWhile \"V. riparia\" shares many important characteristics with its cousin, Vitis vinifera, the small size of the berry (making it prone to predation by birds), the high acidity of its fruit (often up to 5% titratable acidity), the intense pigment of its juice, and the presence of herbaceous aromas in wine produced from it have made it unusable on its own for commercial viticulture.\n\nThese grapes are sometimes used to make flavorful homemade jellies, jams, and wine.\n"}

However, most researchers interpret them as having sequences of labial and coronal consonants, a rather common occurrence in Africa. The Yélî Dnye language of Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea, appears to be unique in having distinct labial–alveolar and labial–postalveolar places of articulation, as illustrated below. (The alveolars are fronted, and the post-alveolars only slightly retracted, so it may be best not to consider the latter to be retroflex as they are sometimes described.)\n\nIn some Ghanaian languages such as Dagbani, and Nzema, there are palatalized allophones of labial–velars. These are sometimes mistakenly referred to as labial–alveolars, though they actually have a post-alveolar or palatal articulation instead of a true alveolar one.\n\nSomething similar is found with the labialized alveolar stops in several Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages such as Abkhaz and Lak. Although the double stop articulation may be more common, they are generally considered to be essentially labialized alveolars because the labial contact is light, and moreover the contact is between the inner surfaces of the lips, which are protruded as they are for [w]. This is quite different from the normal contact for [p] in these languages. The labial contact may also be realized as a trill. Compare the following minimal sets in Ubykh:\n\nSome speakers of !Xóõ have a labial–dental allophone, (or ), of the bilabial click in some cases (Traill 1985: 103–104).\n\nDiscounting clicks otherwise as having a velar/lingual airstream mechanism rather than a double articulation, nearly all other doubly articulated consonants in the world are labial–velars. The labial-alveolars reported from some Chadic languages have upon investigation turned out to be , , and sequences, not single consonants. (See Margi language.)\n"}

Broadcast on weekday mornings on San Diego's famous KGB-FM, the show is named for its three main hosts, Dave Rickards; Shelly Dunn; and Cookie \"Chainsaw\" Randolph, known as the \"Dean of American Sportscasters\". \n\nThe format of the show combines humor, parodies, news and skits. The show's bawdy humor and irreverent attitude, described as \"raucous and often hilarious\", has sometimes sparked controversy. That said, the show is marketed as \"San Diego's most dependably hilarious morning radio show\".\n\nIn addition to the radio programming, the show has produced three comedic films starring Dave, Shelly, and Chainshaw. The group has also released 18 annual \"Best of\" CDs featuring the show's regular cast members. The proceeds from the CDs and DVDs, usually released around Christmas, support the show's charity fund that assists San Diego residents in need.\n\n\"The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show\" debuted in 1990, on KGB-FM as \"The Dawn Patrol\". In 1992, the group moved to Rock 102 and changed the show's name to \"The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show\", often referred to as simply \"DSC\". In 1996, both radio stations were purchased by Jacor Broadcasting (which was later bought by Clear Channel). At that time, the show moved to 105.3 KIOZ (formerly KCBQ) . DSC returned to KGB in 1997.\n\nIn January 2010, the show was abruptly canceled by Clear Channel, with executives citing an \"inability to reach an agreement\" with the performers. The cast denied any agreement was even attempted. Fans of the show protested and staged rallies, to no avail. The show remained off the air until August 2, 2010, when it was picked up by Jack 100.7 FM. The show initially featured Rickards and Randolph, without Dunn, who was still under contract with Clear Channel. 100.7 dropped DSC in the summer of 2018, after which the show returned once again to KGB.\n\nIn addition to Rickards, Dunn, and Randolph, the show includes a support cast consisting of Chris Boyer; producer Emily Maguire, who screens listener calls; Nina Reeba (known as Ruth 66); and Elaina Smith, affectionately dubbed the \"Mexican Leprechaun\" by other members of the show. While Dunn was in a contract dispute with Clear Channel, Smith substituted for Dunn on air. Former cast members have included sports producer David \"Bromo\" Abromowitz and Shelly Brown (who was nicknamed \"Chucko\" to avoid confusion with Shelly Dunn).\n\n\"The J-K Conspiracy\" is a 2004 film directed by Chainsaw, and produced jointly by Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw. The film stars the entire cast of \"The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show\". The story is a semi-fictional tale, written by Jules Hypenstein and based on a real event that took place several years before the movie was made.\n\nPlot: The J through K volume of Chainsaw's World Book encyclopedia has been stolen and (in the movie) Chainsaw accuses Dave of stealing it, triggering a comedic misadventure with guest appearances by co-starring Bob Costas, Dom Irrera, Doug Flutie, Davy Jones, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and Don Rickles. Along the way, viewers get an inside look at real-life flashbacks, radio station politics, bizarre secret meetings, and conspiracy theories, along with the night life parties, sporting events, and live comedy. \n\n\"The Trouble with Money\" is the second film produced by Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw. \n\nPlot: Shamus O'Reilly is supposed to receive $1 million for a scandalous videotape desperately wanted by notorious businessman Kaiser Poppo. Before Shamus arrives for the switch, Poppo's thugs accidentally give the money to Shamus look-alike Dave Rickards, a local radio host in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rickards is chased through the streets of downtown San Diego and onto a train, where he makes a clean getaway with the cash. Now Poppo not only wants the videotape but his money back and must contend with the FBI, con men, and his long-time nemesis \"The Greek\". Despite advice from San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders and Watergate legend G. Gordon Liddy, Rickards loses track of both the money and the videotape. He is then tricked into a dramatic showdown with Poppo, and the secret of the videotape is finally revealed. Shot entirely in San Diego County; cameos from Bob Costas, Luke Walton and Bill Walton.\n\n\"No-Brainer\" is the third film by Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw. Cameos from many celebrities including Will Ferrell, Bob Saget, Paula Abdul, Paula Poundstone, and recurring guest Bob Costas.\n\nThe DSC now offers podcasting of the shows, each day shortly after the live show closes. This allows the fans and listeners of the show to download and take them on the go.\n\nThe DSC has also recently made available their \"Best of...\" CDs now in downloadable format as well from the KFMB site store, beginning in Feb. 2013 with \"Best of The Dawn Patrol - Rookie Season (1990 - 1991)\".

Aristion joined forces with king Mithridates VI of Pontus against Greece’s overlords, the Romans, fighting alongside Pontic forces during the First Mithridatic War, but to no avail. On 1 March 86 BC, after a long and destructive siege, Athens was taken by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla who had Aristion executed.\n\nAristion's early history is preserved by Athenaeus, on the authority of Posidonius. Posidonius calls him Athenion and makes him a Peripatetic philosopher, whereas others, Pausanias, Appian, and Plutarch, call him Aristion, and Appian calls him an Epicurean philosopher. There is no universally accepted resolution to this confusion, and it is possible that there were two separate tyrants who held power in Athens in quick succession during the First Mithridatic War whose stories became conflated together. This is the most commonly accepted explanation for the confusion between the two figures. Athenion was likely an Athenian citizen and Peripatetic philosopher that was elected hoplite general in 88 BC. Aristion is a fellow Peripatetic philosopher who seized the reigns of Athenian government in c. 88 BC. \n\nAristion was the illegitimate son of a Peripatetic philosopher to whose party he succeeded, and so became an Athenian citizen. He married early, and began at the same time to teach philosophy, which he did with great success at Messene and Larissa. On returning to Athens with a considerable fortune, he was named ambassador to Mithridates, king of Pontus, then at war with Rome, and became one of his most intimate friends and counsellors. His letters to Athens represented the power of Mithridates in such glowing colours, that his countrymen began to conceive of hopes of throwing off Roman rule. Mithridates then sent him to Athens around 88 BC, where he soon contrived, through the king's patronage, to assume the tyranny. His government seems to have been of the most cruel character, so that he is spoken of with horror by Plutarch, and classed by him with Nabis and Catiline. He sent Apellicon of Teos to plunder the sacred treasury of Delos, though Appian says that this had already been done for him by Mithridates, and adds that it was by means of the money resulting from this robbery that Aristion was enabled to obtain supreme power. Meanwhile, Sulla landed in Greece, and immediately laid siege to Athens and Piraeus, the latter of which was occupied by Archelaus, the general of Mithridates. The sufferings within the city from famine were so dreadful that cannibalism was reported. Eventually Athens was stormed, and Sulla gave orders to spare neither age nor sex. Aristion fled to the Acropolis, having first burned the Odeon, in case Sulla should use the woodwork for battering rams and other instruments of attack. The Acropolis, however, was soon taken, and Aristion dragged to execution from the altar of Athena and poisoned. Pausanias attributes the unpleasant disease that later killed Sulla as divine vengeance for this impiety.\n"}

In the former, Dryden apologizes for his allegiance with the Cromwellian government. Dryden was later excused by Samuel Johnson for this change in allegiance when he wrote, 'if he changed, he changed with the nation.'\n\nThe period between Cromwell and the Restoration is presented in \"Astraea\" as a time of chaos, and Charles is greeted as a restorer of peace. In the traditional form of the panegyric, Charles is praised for qualities which it is hoped he will attain as well as for those he already possesses, and Dryden recommends that Charles adopt a policy of toleration.\n\nThe poem well illustrates Dryden's lifelong commitment to peace and political stability. It also that Dryden was looking for a royal patron.\n\nThe name of the poem \"Astraea Redux\" is defined in \"The Nuttall Encyclopaedia\" as \"an era which piques itself on the return of the reign of justice to the earth.\"\n\n"}

According to an interview with Kensuke Tanabe, producer of \"Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\", character designer Imamura created Tingle in a \"very relaxed manner.\" He was also in charge of the character design of the games \"F-Zero\" and \"Star Fox\". In an interview with \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", director Eiji Aonuma stated that he had \"found out some American people didn't like him very much\" and ultimately decided not to include him in \"\" as a result. In a later interview with \"Nintendo Dream\", he stated that the character Purlo is his reference to Tingle in \"Twilight Princess\". According to Aonuma, Purlo's appearance \"is the result of wondering what a realistic Tingle would look like\".\n\nTingle, in his Wind Waker form is a short, pudgy 35-year-old, while Tingle, in his Majora's Mask form, is an averaged-sized, paunchy 35-year-old in man who is obsessed with \"forest fairies\" and dresses up in a green costume, slightly resembling that of Link. He also wears tight red shorts and a necklace with a clock that is permanently stuck at four o'clock. Tingle is normally seen floating around on his red balloon drawing and selling maps for his father, who runs the Southern Swamp pictograph contest and sees Tingle as \"a fool\". He is also known for his catchphrase: \"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah!\" . Tingle appears to have a fixation for Rupees and other similar collectibles, such as Force Gems in \"\" and Kinstones in \"\". In \"Majora's Mask\", Tingle can be found selling maps, and in \"The Wind Waker\", he translates Triforce Maps for a high price, among other things. Tingle's fixation for Rupees is explained in the Nintendo DS game \"Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\", where it is stated that he needs Rupees to live. He is known to dress as a fairy.\n\nAnkle is Tingle's younger brother and Knuckle's twin. In \"The Wind Waker\", he is found turning the grinding wheel at Tingle Tower with David Jr.. The reason he does so much work is to support his brother, Knuckle. He also has a love of gardening. He also appears in \"Four Swords Adventures\" and later in \"The Minish Cap\", where he fuses Kinstones behind Lon Lon Ranch. His outfit is faded purple.\n\nKnuckle is Ankle's twin and the one who built Tingle Tower. In \"The Wind Waker\", he is largely a side-quest character, requiring use of the Tingle Tuner to find. By doing so, Link can gain the Hand-Me-Down Tuner which provides additional options. He also appears in \"Four Swords Adventures\" and later in \"The Minish Cap\", where he fuses Kinstones in Trilby Highlands. His outfit is light blue.\n\nDavid Jr., although similar in appearance to Tingle and his brothers, is from Windfall Island and is unrelated to Tingle. After getting shipwrecked on Tingle Island, he was forced by Tingle to work turning the wheel. Unenthusiastic about his role, he does it anyway, although he is prone to complaining. When reading his inscription in the Nintendo Gallery, it implies that his father was the one who made the ghost ship chart, but died immediately after doing so. He also appears in \"Four Swords Adventures\" and \"The Minish Cap\", the latter of which sees him fusing Kinstones in Lake Hylia. His outfit is white.\n\nTingle made his debut in the Nintendo 64 game \"\". Throughout Link's adventure, Tingle helps Link navigate Termina by selling him maps of various areas. Tingle appears in Clock Town, Southern Swamp, Woodfall, Mountain Village, Milk Road, Great Bay, Ikana Valley, Stone Tower, and outside Zora Hall. His father operates the pictograph contest at the Woodfall Swamp, and is ashamed by his son's antics, although he admits that perhaps he spoiled him too much.\n\nTingle doesn't appear in \"Oracle of Seasons\" but does appear in \"\", giving Link a chart that he needs to cross the sea. He also gives Link upgrades to the Seed Satchel, the first increasing its capacity to 50 of every seed and the second (available only in a linked game) to 99 of every seed.\n\nTingle's first appearance in \"\" is in a small, dingy prison cell on Windfall Island. He was imprisoned for being mistaken for a troublemaker. When freed, Tingle gives Link the Tingle Tuner, a device that can be used if the player connects a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable. This allows a second player to control Tingle and assist Link by selling him potions, providing him with a shield, and allowing him to float and drop bombs. However, in the , Tingle gives Link the Tingle Bottle, which can be used to post on Miiverse, instead of the Tingle Tuner. Tingle also gives the player a crudely drawn map to Tingle Island, and can be found for the rest of the game on this island, near the top of Tingle Tower. According to the Tingle Tuner, Tingle is merely a native of a different island with a Tingle-centric legend, in parallel to the Link-centric legend of Outset Island. He deciphers the charts needed to haul the Triforce Shards from the ocean floor. He is also known for his extortionate prices; he demands 398 Rupees per chart, plus 201 Rupees for the IN-credible Chart that shows the location of the Triforce Charts and Triforce Shards from the charts that have been deciphered. This game also introduced his brothers, Ankle and Knuckle, who are twins, and David Jr., who is not related but was (supposedly) saved by Tingle after his ship was sucked into a cyclone.\n\nTingle appears in the GameCube game \"\". If a player leaves a good deal of Force Gems lying around for too long, Tingle will eventually float towards them on his balloon to steal them. The players must grab them before he does (although while playing multi-player, players are given the option of turning this off). There is also a trap in this game that causes Tingle to lead an army of lookalikes and steal the gems directly from the Links.\n\nTingle, Ankle, Knuckle, and David Jr. are able to fuse Kinstones with Link in the Game Boy Advance game \"\". Fusing Kinstones is an action that Link can do with many people, animals, and seemingly inanimate objects throughout the game, which influences the game world to give Link access to an item or new area. When all four have fused Kinstones with Link, a passage will open on the Castle Grounds that gives him the Magic Boomerang. Tingle, his brothers, and David Jr. can also tell Link how many Kinstone fusions remain. Once Link has done every Kinstone fusion, Tingle will award Link with the Tingle statue.\n\nIn \"\", Tingle makes a small appearance in Mercay Island's bar, as a poster on the wall. In \"\", an small Tingle figurine is in Hyrule Castle Town's shop and Linebeck III's shop. In \"\", a Tingle doll can be seen in Zelda's room at the Knight Academy. Tingle appears as an additional playable character in \"Hyrule Warriors\" via the \"Majora's Mask\" DLC pack. In \"\" the main character Link is able to discover and wear a Tingle outfit made available via a DLC pack.\n\nTingle's first starring role was in the spin-off title game known as \"Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\" for the Nintendo DS. It tells the story of Tingle as a simple, 35-year-old man who ended up becoming a Tingle after meeting a character known as Uncle Rupee. The game explain why all of Tingle's incarnations have been so obsessed with Rupees, as well as why he wears his 'fairy suit'. The game was released in Japan in 2006 and one year later in Europe on September 14. Although the game scored high reviews in both Japan and Europe, it never saw a North American release. This was likely due to a poll on Nintendo's website asking if the game should be brought to America. The poll slightly swung against an American release due to the poor perception that Tingle had received in the region.\n\n is a Nintendo DS arcade style platformer published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console, which is solely available to Platinum Club Nintendo members. The game itself is based not only on \"The Legend of Zelda\", but on \"Balloon Fight\" as well, making this the third entry in the latter franchise (following the first title and \"Balloon Kid\").\n\nTingle's Balloon Fight uses the same game design as \"Balloon Fight\". The game has three modes: Balloon Fight (single player), local wireless Balloon Fighting Spirit (2–4 players), and Balloon Trip (single-player). Performing various accomplishments throughout the game (winning multiplayer matches, achievements in scoring, and other as yet unknown methods) unlocks artwork in a gallery of Tingle portraits, available on the Options screen of the game. The game was released exclusively to members of Club Nintendo in Japan.\n\nAn issue of the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" published in June 2009 contained a teaser advertisement depicting a tiny picture of Tingle along with a line of text saying \"Yōsei?\" (ようせい?, lit. \"Fairy?\"). On June 12, 2009, Nintendo opened a teaser website, hinting at an upcoming Nintendo DS game starring Tingle. Later, a DSiWare title named \"Dekisugi Tingle Pack\" (lit. \"Too Much Tingle Pack\") was released in Japan on June 24, which is a collection of Tingle themed applications. Another issue of \"Famitsu\" published in late June revealed a Nintendo DS game titled \"Irodzuki Tincle no Koi no Balloon Trip\" (lit. \"Ripening Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love\"), which is a sequel to \"Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\". It was released in Japan on August 6, 2009.\n\n\"Dekisugi Tingle Pack\" (lit. \"Too Much Tingle Pack\") is a DSiWare application that includes several different minigames, including a fortune-teller, calculator, timer, coin-flipper and dancing game. It was released on June 24, 2009 as a promotional application for \"Irozuki Tingle no Koi no Balloon Trip\".\n\nTingle appears in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" as part of the Termina Bay stage, as well as an Assist Trophy in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\". In those games, he threw out a large amount of items that could quickly be grabbed by all of the fighters. However, he would sometimes just float away, not doing anything. He also appears as a trophy in those games, the former based on \"\" and the latter two based on \"\".\n\nTingle also appears in \"Super Mario Maker\" as one of the unlockable \"Mystery Mushroom\" outfits.\n\nThe editors at IGN did not like Tingle, in part because his role in \"\" was an integral part of \"tedious fetch quests\". They titled the article \"IGNcube's 2004 \"Die, Tingle, Die! Die!\" Campaign.\" When development for \"\" began, IGN hoped that game directors Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma would not include the character, saying \"we're not going to stand for him in another Zelda game\". Tingle ranked sixth on GameDaily's top 10 ugliest game characters list, stating that his face looks out of place. GamesRadar described him as \"Zelda's Jar Jar\". \"Nintendo Power\" listed Tingle as one of the three weirdos, describing him as both a great cartographer as well as a \"fully grown man in a green elf costume who rides a balloon and says, 'Tingle! Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah!'\". Fan distaste for Tingle led to his exclusion from \"Twilight Princess\". PALGN editor Matt Keller stated that Tingle was widely considered the weakest part of \"\". IGN, among others, ranked him number 1 of the top 20 weirdest Zelda characters.\n\nHowever, many fans have stood up for Tingle, as well his respective game series. Criticism of the character primarily comes from Western gamers, but in Japan, Tingle has garnered a cult following, which resulted in the development of several spin-off games featuring Tingle as their star. In a 2013 interview with VentureBeat, Kensuke Tanabe had expressed interest in making another Tingle game, having stated: \"I know that people cannot stand Tingle. But to me that challenge is: Could I take this character that is so reviled in the West and just [do] a complete turnaround and make him a beloved, fun character? The idea of that really just gets me going. I know we have made a Tingle game in the past, but maybe at some point down the road.\" He later joked that \"it's like romance: You meet someone and you're like, 'Oh god, I can't stand that person.' And then three weeks later, you're madly in love – it's that turn, that quick whip, that motivates [me] a little bit.”\n"}

She is currently a principal dancer with the English National Ballet, and formerly The Royal Ballet.\n\nAlina Cojocaru was born and raised in Bucharest, Romania. She has one sister. From a young age she studied gymnastics. Later she began ballet classes, despite never having seen a live ballet.\n\nAt the age of 7 or 8 she began gymnastic classes, progressing at the age of 9 to a Bucharest ballet school which acted as a feeder for the Romanian State Ballet school. Later the same year she took and passed the entrance exam for the school and a few months later was chosen (with 8 other Romanian students) by the director of the Kiev Ballet school to take part in a student exchange.\n\nShe left her family to train at the school, and did not speak any Russian. Initially, Cojocaru and the other Romanian students were taught separately, before being integrated with the other students in the third year.\n\nThe ballet school gave a public performance every six months and it was in one of these performances that Cojocaru made her debut, dancing the role of \"Amor\" in \"Don Quixote\".\n\nIn January 1997, aged 15, she competed in the Prix de Lausanne international ballet competition. There, she was awarded a six-month scholarship to train at the Royal Ballet School in London. In June she won a silver medal at the Moscow Ballet Competition and impressed the audience in \"Musketeer\" by Alla Rubina. She moved to London later that year to commence her training, but did not speak any English.\n\nAfter completing her six month training with the Royal Ballet School, Cojocaru was offered a contract to join The Royal Ballet as a member of the corps de ballet. She was also offered a contract to join the Kiev Ballet as principal. She subsequently joined Kiev Ballet in November 1998, believing she would gain greater experience as a principal dancer. She stayed for one season, dancing a variety of roles.\n\nWhilst dancing with Kiev Ballet, Cojocaru re-applied to the Royal Ballet in London, but was only invited to audition for the corps de ballet. She attended an audition for the company whilst on leave from Kiev Ballet and was offered a contract. Doubtful of development opportunities elsewhere, she accepted the contract and joined the company in November 1999. She was subsequently promoted to principal dancer in 2001. In 2004, she received the Prix Benois de la Danse for her portrayal of \"Cinderella\".\n\nCojocaru's early appearances with the company included performing in the opening gala for the refurbished Royal Opera House, plus appearances with the corps de ballet in the Kingdom of the Shades from \"La Bayadère\", as a snowflake in \"The Nutcracker\" and as a doll in \"Coppélia\".\n\nOne of the highlights of her career is her partnership with Danish principal dancer, Johan Kobborg. The partnership began in 2001 when they danced together in \"Romeo and Juliet\" after Cojocaru filled in for an injured Miyako Yoshida. Since then, Kobborg and Cojocaru's partnership has been named one of the greatest in the history of ballet, and they have danced together at Covent Garden and worldwide.\n\nIn 2012, Cojocaru became the first ballerina to receive the Prix Benois de la Danse twice, this time for John Neumeier's \"Liliom\" with the Hamburg Ballet. The lead role of \"Julie\" also marked the first time a full-length ballet was created around Cojocaru.\n\nIn June 2013, she announced that she and Kobborg would leave The Royal Ballet at the end of 2012/13 season. Their last performance in London was in \"Mayerling\" on 5 June, followed by scheduled performances on 10 and 12 July with the company in Tokyo.\n\nIn July 2013, following her departure from the Royal Ballet, Cojocaru joined the English National Ballet as a principal dancer. The company is directed by her former Royal Ballet colleague Tamara Rojo She is also a guest at the Hamburg Ballet. She now split her time between London and Hamburg, where she developed a close creative relationship with John Neumeier.\n\nIn December 2013, she also joined the Romanian National Ballet as a principal after Kobborg became the company's artistic director. However, in 2016, actions by new leadership at the Bucharest National Opera House resulted in both Kobborg and Cojocaru resigning, triggering protests by dancers. The new management then apparently banned them from even setting foot in the theatre. \n\nShe won the Critics’ Circle National Dance Awards 2017 Outstanding Female Performance (Classical) for her portrayal of the title role in Akram Khan's \"Giselle\". In 2020, she performed a self produce show, \"Alina at Sadler's Wells\" at the Sadler's Wells Theatre. The show included Frederick Ashton's \"Marguerite and Armand\", and Tim Rushton’s \"Reminiscence\", a new commissioned piece, which was danced with Johan Kobborg.\n\nIn 2008, during rehearsal when an unidentified partner handled her awkwardly in a lift, Cojocaru suffered a whiplash injury that could have ended her career. But after surgery and months of rest, and following the rehabilitation regimen guided by Patrick Rump, she successfully recovered and eventually returned to dancing.\n\nCojocaru's performance as Clara in Peter Wright's Royal Ballet production of \"The Nutcracker\" was taped and first telecast in the US in 2001. It is available on DVD. Her performance as Aurora in the Royal Ballet's new production of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" has not been telecast in the US yet, but has become available on DVD.\n\nHer performance as \"Giselle\", alongside Johan Kobborg as Albrecht was recorded in 2006, broadcast in England on Boxing Day, and released on DVD the following year.\n\nCojocaru lives with her fiancé, Johan Kobborg. After Kobborg became her most frequent partner, it was publicly announced in 2005 that they were in a romantic relationship. In May 2011, Cojocaru was making a guest appearance at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, but her dance partner was injured so Kobborg flew over unexpectedly to fill in and surprised Cojocaru when he proposed to her on her 30th birthday. Their engagement was announced shortly afterward. In May 2017, Cojocaru announced on Twitter that she and Kobborg are expecting their first child. On 10 October 2017, Kobborg announced via Twitter that Cojocaru had given birth to their daughter Thalia Chulpan.\n\n\n"}

After being denied from local law schools because of her gender, she was admitted by Howard University, a historically black college and university. Yet, the Washington College of Law, which she founded in 1898, did not accept people of color until 1950.\n\nGillett was born on July 30, 1852, in Princeton, Wisconsin, to Wisconsin homesteaders. She was educated in Girard, Pennsylvania, where her family moved following the death of her father. In 1870, she graduated from Lake Erie College and taught for the following ten years in the Pennsylvania public school system. During her time as a teacher, she became frustrated with the meager wages paid to single women teachers.\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Gillett's role in the settlement of her estate sparked an interest in law, as well as being a better paying profession. Encouraged by the news of Belva Lockwood, who had become the first female law student at National University in Washington, DC; Gillett moved to Washington in hopes of following in Lockwood's footsteps. Unfortunately, she found that National University had closed its doors to women. Gillette did gain admission at Howard University and graduated in 1882 with an LLB, followed in 1883 with an LLM. She passed the bar in the District of Columbia the same year. She also became first woman to be appointed a notary public by the president of the United States.\n\nAfter admission to the bar, she formed a partnership with Watson J. Newton, which continued until the death of Newton in 1913. At one time she was connected with the District Title Insurance Company and was later Vice President of the Realty Appraisal & Title Company.\n\nDuring this time, her colleague and friend, Ellen Spencer Mussey, sought her assistance in the education of women in the field of law. Mussey had been approached in 1895 by Delia Sheldon Jackson, an aspiring attorney, to apprentice her as a student of law. Realizing both the scope of the task and the significance of the opportunity, Mussey sought out the assistance of Gillett. The two opened the first session of the Woman's Law Class on February 1, 1896. The class had an enrollment of three: Jackson and two other women, Nanette Paul and Helen Malcolm.\n\nWithin a few years, the program had expanded and several prominent Washington, DC, attorneys were brought in for assistance. Although Mussey and Gillett had not initially aspired to establish an independent law school, when Columbian College (now George Washington University) refused their request to take on the women they had educated for their final year of education—on grounds that \"women did not have the mentality for law\"—the two decided to establish a co-educational law school specifically open to women.\n\nThus, in April 1898, the Washington College of Law–newly merged with American University–was incorporated in Washington, DC, as the first law school in the world founded by women.\n\nGillett helped in the establishment of a women's club, \"The Wimondaughsis\", in DC.\n\nWith Ellen Spencer Mussey, her colleague and co-founder of the Washington College of Law, Gillett founded the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. Responding to the written invitation issued by Mussey, calling an initial meeting of \"an association of women lawyers in the District of Columbia\" on May 17, 1917, 29 other women lawyers joined Gillett and Mussey as charter members of the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. At that time, only New York City, Chicago, and Omaha had organized women's bar associations.\n\nGillett held many additional roles, including Vice President for the District of Columbia of the American Bar Association in 1922; President of the State Suffrage Association of the District; President of the Women's Bar Association in 1921, and at the time of her death was Dean Emeritus of the Washington College of Law and Chairman of the Legal Branch of the National Woman's Party.\n\nGillett died on January 23, 1927, after contracting pneumonia while confined to her bed after breaking her hip the previous October.\n"}

As a result, the company’s share price dropped 60% and the company subsequently withdrew from the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nIn 2008, Anurag Dikshit pleaded guilty to violation of the Federal Wire Act, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, and personally paid $300 million to the United States Department of Justice as part of his plea. In 2009, PartyGaming entered a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and paid a fine of $105 million. In 2011, the Justice Department reversed its earlier position, determining that the Federal Wire Act does not apply to online poker and casino games, only to sports betting.\n\nParasol is the principal benefactor and a founding member of the International Advisory Board of The Parasol Foundation Trust (formerly known as the Bonita Trust), a Gibraltar-based independent philanthropic organization that was founded 2004.

It was built in 1679 by the Ottomans, in order to contain the Inner Mani region. Some years later, in 1685, the Maniots besieged the castle. They sent messengers to Venice so the Doge could send a fleet to help them capture the castle. The Venetians were currently at war with the Ottomans so they agreed and sent a fleet under Francesco Morosini. As soon the fleets bearing the symbol of St Mark the Ottoman garrison surrendered. A year later the Ottomans returned with a strong force and laid siege to the castle but were driven back. Along with the rest of the Peloponnese, the castle remained in Venetian hands for about 30 years, but in 1715 the Ottomans recaptured the Peloponnese.

It is owned and operated by iHeartMedia and broadcasts a classic rock music format. KGB-FM's studios are located in San Diego's Kearny Mesa neighborhood on the northeast side, and the transmitter is located in East San Diego east of Balboa Park.\n\nThe station has broadcast using the HD Radio digital transmission format since 2005.\n\nThe 101.5 MHz FM frequency originally signed on the air in 1950 as KSON-FM, owned by Fred Rabel. It is the second-oldest FM station in San Diego; the former KFSD-FM (now KMYI) at 94.1 FM debuted in 1948. Rabel later sold the signal to Brown Broadcasting in 1958. KSON-FM was moved off the KSON AM tower on the corner of Highway 15 and Interstate 5, to the new site of sister station KGB (1360 AM, now KLSD) at 52nd Street and Kalmia. KSON-FM's call letters were changed to KGB-FM. In 1964, Brown Broadcasting hired Bill Drake to consult for the new KGB as the format he installed there later became known as \"Boss Radio\". In 1964, KGB and KGB-FM were separated, and the latter became KBKB, a beautiful music station.\n\nBy 1972, Boss Radio on KGB was failing and more focus was being given to KBKB. Brown Broadcasting hired Ron Jacobs to turn around the FM station. Jacobs' first move was to restore the KGB-FM call letters and to drop Boss Radio from 1360 AM. Jacobs created San Diego's first-ever freeform progressive album-oriented rock FM superstation, further nurtured by station general manager Sonny Jim Price. Among the innovations introduced during this era of KGB-FM is the station's iconic mascot, the \"KGB Chicken\" (now known as the \"San Diego Chicken\"), a series of records called the \"Homegrown\" albums, and the \"Sky Show\", a fireworks display set to rock music.\n\nKGB-FM has hosted many of San Diego's most prominent radio and television personalities. Such hosts include Lawrence \"Larry The Cruiser\" Himmel, Bob \"B.C.\" Coburn, Dave Benson, Damian Bragdon, Gabriel Wisdom, Erik Thompson, Jim McInnes, Ricky Leibert, Patrick Martin, Larry Bruce, Bill Hergonson, Ernesto Gladden, Ted Edwards, Linda McInnes, Digby Welch, Kevin McKeown, Pamela Edwards, Brian Schock, Susan Hemphill, Johnny Leslie, Andrew \"Long Tall Andy\" Geller, Blair and Kymythy Schultz, Philip Hendrie, Jeffrey Prescott, Michael Berger, Sue Delaney, Coe Lewis, \"Steve-o\", Cindy Spicer, Ted \"The Chicken\" Giannoulas, and Mojo Nixon. KGB-FM news anchors include Bradley Messer, Brent Seltzer, with Gerry Gazlay, and George Wilson.\n\nOne prominent longtime fixture on KGB-FM, and on San Diego rock radio in general, is \"The DSC Show\". The morning zoo program, hosted by Dave Rickards, Shelly Dunn, and Cookie \"Chainsaw\" Randolph, debuted on KGB-FM in 1990 as \"The Dawn Patrol\". In 1994, the program moved to KIOZ (originally at 102.1 FM, now at 105.3), where it was renamed \"The Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw Show\" and aired for three years. Upon returning to KGB-FM in 1997, the show's name was shortened to \"The DSC\". From August 2, 2010 to July 19, 2018, the program was broadcast on KFMB-FM (100.7). Prior to the show's cancellation on \"100.7 KFM-BFM\", co-host Shelly Dunn announced her retirement from radio broadcasting. On August 6, 2018, \"The DSC Show\" returned to KGB-FM once again with the remainder of the cast.\n\nKGB-FM airs \"The Beatles Radio Show\", hosted by Ken Dashow, on Sundays.\n\nIn 1974, KGB introduced the \"KGB-FM 101 Chicken\", an advertising mascot played by Ted Giannoulas. Ted then a student at San Diego State University was hired to wear a chicken outfit for a promotion to distribute both 1360 KGB and KGB-FM 101 Easter eggs to children at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The KGB-FM 101 Chicken whose wacky but fun antics entertained steadily larger crowds, moved on to features at concerts and sporting events, including appearances at more than 520 consecutive San Diego Padres baseball games. Conflict emerged however between the station and Ted and he was dismissed in 1977. Another unnamed employee was hired to take his place, which triggered a lawsuit by Ted.\n\nAfter a court found in his favor in June 1979, Ted was allowed to continue to perform in a chicken costume but though not the same one as the original costume. He return with a brand spanking new name, this time as the San Diego Chicken was witnessed by 47,000 people at what was called a \"Grand Hatching\" event, where he emerged from a styroform egg as the theme from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" played, since then Ted and his alternate ego The Chicken is still truly representing the city of San Diego and 101 KGB-FM to this very important day.\n\nIn 1973, KGB-FM created an annual contest called \"Homegrown\", in which local singers and songwriters submitted songs about the San Diego area for inclusion on an album produced by the station. The songwriting contest is the brainchild of KGB-FM program director Ron Jacobs, who first held such an event at KHJ (AM) in Los Angeles. The \"Homegrown\" album series was introduced in response to the cancellation of the popular \"Charity Ball\" event at San Diego Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium), a venue for which the station was not granted usage in 1973 after holding it the previous year. Proceeds from sale of the albums were donated to local charities. The contest ran through 1978, yielding seven albums named \"Homegrown\" through \"Homegrown VII\" with copyrights from 1973 to 1979. There were two additional \"Homegrown\" albums: \"Homegrown's Greatest Hits\" (1978) with favorite selections from previous albums, and \"Homegrown Songs for '84\" with additional songs by San Diego artists about the area.\n\n\nIn 1976, singer Stephen Bishop submitted his song \"On and On\", but it was rejected because he submitted it on cassette tape instead of the required reel-to-reel format. The song went on to become a commercial hit.\n\nIn 1976, KGB-FM launched the annual \"KGB Sky Show\" and it has been held continuously ever since. (\"Sky Show 40\" was held on September 5, 2015.) The \"Sky Show\" is a fireworks display, synchronized to a music soundtrack, broadcast on the radio. This artform was invented by KGB and is now practiced worldwide. The first Sky Show was fired from two locations, Fiesta Island and Chollas Lake. It created traffic jams all over the city as people watched and listened. The firing site was moved to San Diego (Jack Murphy)(Qualcomm) Stadium for reasons of crowd control. The show has become a very well attended annual event with fans viewing from both inside the stadium and outside, tailgating in the parking lot or from vantage points along Mission Valley's canyon rim. The KGB Sky Show also introduced the use of Rock and Roll music, multimedia, video, theatrical lighting and effects to enhance the fireworks display. According to its creator Rick Leibert, Sky Show is \"continuing experiment blending the ancient art of fireworks with rock and roll\". The creative team for Sky Show has been collaborating for more than 20 years. Blair Schultze has been Writer/Producer/Director of the KGB Sky Show since 1988, and Ron Dixon has been Fireworks coordinator since 1979 and choreographer since 1990.\n\nKGB-FM has garnered several honors throughout its existence. \"Billboard\" magazine named KGB-FM its \"Station of the Year\" in 1974, and \"Rolling Stone\" designated it \"Rock Station of the Year\" in 1991.\n\n"}

They are commonly known as shrub frogs, or more ambiguously as \"moss frogs\" or \"bush frogs\". Some Rhacophoridae are called \"tree frogs\". Among the most spectacular members of this family are numerous \"flying frogs\".\n\nAlthough a few groups are primarily terrestrial, rhacophorids are predominantly treefrogs which are arboreal. Mating frogs, while in amplexus, hold on to a branch, and beat their legs to form a foam. The eggs are laid in the foam and covered with seminal fluid before the foam hardens into a protective casing. In some species, this is done in a large group. The foam is laid above a water source so the tadpoles fall into the water once they hatch.\n\nThe species within this family vary in size from . Like other arboreal frogs, they have toe discs, and those of the genus \"Chiromantis\" have two opposable fingers on each hand. This family also contains the Old World flying frogs, including Wallace's flying frog (\"Rhacophorus nigropalmatus\"). These frogs have extensive webbing between their forelimbs and hindlimbs, allowing them to glide through the air.\n\nThe following phylogeny of Rhacophoridae is from Yu et al. (2008).\nAs many frogs, Rhacophorids harbour monogeneans worms in their urinary bladder. The parasite species specialized to this family of frogs belong to the genus \"Indopolystoma\", described in 2019.\n"}

He worked for \"The New York Times\" as a news assistant for four years after which he relocated to Nigeria to work with \"Daily Times\".\n\nDele Giwa and fellow journalists Ray Ekpu, Dan Agbese and Yakubu Mohammed founded \"Newswatch\" in 1984, and the first edition was distributed on 28 January 1985.\nA 1989 description of the magazine said it \"changed the format of print journalism in Nigeria [and] introduced bold, investigative formats to news reporting in Nigeria\".\nHowever, in the first few months of the administration of General Ibrahim Babangida, who took power in August 1985, the magazine was shamelessly flattering. It printed his face on the cover four times and even criticised \"anyone who attempted to make life unpleasant for Babangida\".\nLater, the paper took a more hostile view of the Babangida regime.\n\nGiwa married an American nurse in 1974. His second marriage, to Florence Ita Giwa, lasted 10 months. He later married Olufunmilayo Olaniyan on 10 July 1984, and they were married until his death in 1986. He was survived by his mother, wives and children.\n\nDele Giwa was killed by a mail bomb in his Lagos home on 19 October 1986. The assassination occurred two days after he had been interviewed by State Security Service (SSS) officials. In an off-the-record interview with airport journalists, Lt. Col. A.K. Togun, the Deputy Director of the SSS had claimed that on 9 October Dele Giwa and Alex Ibru had organised a media parley for media executives and the newly created SSS. Togun claimed that it was at this meeting that the SSS and the media executives reached a secret censorship agreement. Under this agreement, the media was to report any story with potential to embarrass the government to the SSS before they tried to publish same.\n\nGiwa had been invited by the SSS to their headquarters for the first time on 19 September 1986 after writing an article in which he described the newly introduced Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM) as \"God's experiment\" and suggested that if SFEM failed, the people would will stone their leaders in the streets. Giwa was interviewed and his statement taken by two SSS operatives. He was later taken to meet with Lt Col Togun, the deputy director of the agency in his office. Togun is reported to have told Giwa that he found nothing offensive in the story as Giwa had also stated in the same story that he was hopeful that Babangida seemed determined to make SFEM work.\n\nAccording to Giwa's neighbour and colleague, Ray Ekpu, on 16 October 1986, Giwa had been questioned over the telephone by Col Halilu Akilu of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) over an allegation that Dele had been heard speaking to some people about arms importation. SSS officials reportedly summoned Giwa to their headquarters again on 16 October 1986, and on the next day Ekpu accompanied him to the SSS headquarters for the interview. Lt. Col Togun accused Giwa and \"Newswatch\" of planning to write the \"other side\" of the story on Ebitu Ukiwe who was removed as Chief of the General staff, to General Babangida. The magazine had published a cover story titled, \"Power Games: Ukiwe loses out\", in its edition of 20 October which was on sale on 13 October 1986. Togun also accused Giwa plotting with the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and students to carry out a socialist revolution. Giwa was also accused of saying that \"Newswatch\" would employ the suspended police public relations officer Alozie Ogugbuaja. Ogugbuaja claims that on 16 October 1986, a bomb was defused by the police bomb squad at his official residence in GRA, Ikeja, Lagos. Ogugbuaja also said that he suspected that his phone might have been bugged because Giwa and Ray Ekpu in one of their telephone conversations with him had indeed promised to employ him in \"Newswatch\" if the police dismissed him. Ray Ekpu also believed that their houses and phones may have been bugged because he did discuss employing Ogugbuaja in \"Newswatch\" with dele Giwa over the phone only; he said that he found two bugging devices in the cover of two books inside his study. Lt. Col. Togun while questioning Giwa had claimed that he wasn't aware of the fact that Akilu had already questioned Giwa over the gun running allegations the day before, this was after Giwa had brought it to his attention.\n\nGiwa reported the interrogations to his friend Prince Tony Momoh who was then the Minister of Communications, Giwa had told Momoh that he feared for his life because of the weight of the accusations levelled against him. According to Ekpu, Momoh \"dismissed it as a joke and said the security men just wanted to rattle him\"; Momoh promised to look into the matter. On 18 October Giwa also spoke to Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, the Chief of General Staff who said he was familiar with the matter and also promised to look into it.\n\nLater on 18 October, a day before the bombing, a staff of the DMI had phoned Giwa's house and asked for his office phone number from his wife Funmi. This same person from the DMI later called back to say he couldn't reach Giwa at the office and then put Col Akilu on the line. Ekpu alleges that Akilu asked Giwa's wife for driving directions to the house and when she asked him why he needed the directions he explained that he wanted to stop by the house on his way to Kano and he wasn't very familiar with Ikeja, he also offered that the President's ADC had something for Giwa, probably an invitation. According to Ekpu this didn't come as a surprise because Giwa had received advance copies of some of the President's speeches in the past through Akilu.\n\nOn 19 October, Giwa phoned Akilu to ask why he had been calling his house the previous day, Akilu was alleged to have explained that he only wanted to tell Giwa that the matter had been resolved. Ekpu says Giwa replied Akilu that it wasn't over and that he had already informed his lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi to follow up on the matter. Akilu then told Giwa that there was no need for that, that it wasn't a matter for lawyers and that he should consider the matter resolved.\n\nAbout 40 minutes after the telephone conversation with Akilu, a package was delivered to Giwa's guard (the accounts of which vehicle was used to deliver the package vary). When Giwa received the package, he was with Kayode Soyinka (London Bureau Chief of \"Newswatch\"). The package exploded, mortally wounded Giwa and temporarily deafening Soyinka, who had excused himself to the rest room shortly before Giwa was supposed to have attempted opening the package. Giwa was rushed to the hospital where he eventually died from his wounds.\n\nOn twenty October, the day after the bombing, the government convened a press conference presided over by Augustus Aikhomu. Before the press conference started, all press photographers, foreign journalists, and Nigerians that worked for foreign news media were ordered out. Those left behind were told that the briefing was \"off the record\" and Aikhomu would not be entertaining any questions.\n\nAikhomu then went on to ask Ismaila Gwarzo, the Director of the SSS and Haliru Akilu to render their accounts of what had transpired between Dele Giwa and their agencies in the recent past. Gwarzo confirmed that the SSS had invited Giwa for questioning over allegations of gun running. Akilu on his part confirmed that he had called Giwa's home on 18 October to ask for directions to the house so he could stop over to see Giwa while on his way to Kano through Ikeja airport. Akilu also said that he had wanted to visit Giwa at home to \"prove a Hausa adage that if you visit someone in his house, you show him you are really a friend.\" Ekpu claimed that he remembered Gwarzo saying that the killing was \"quite embarrassing\" and also that Tony Momoh had described it as \"a clear case of assassination\"; later he was quoted saying, \"a special probe would serve no useful purpose\".\nGraffiti of the time implied a belief that the SSS had been responsible.\n\nIn a newspaper interview years later in retirement, Chris Omeben who at the time was the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (FIIB) at Alagbon, on his part recalled that he was the second officer to have handled the case file after he had taken it over from his predecessor at the FIIB, Victor Pam. Omeben explained that he had done what any competent investigator would have done in unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of Dele Giwa. He went on to say that he had examined the crime scene and found it suspicious that the toilet adjacent to the blast site which Kayode Soyinka alleged he was occupying when the explosion occurred had also suffered damage from the blast but Soyinka was left unscathed. Omeben described the force of the explosion to have been strong enough to blow out the steel bars over the toilet window (burglary protection), which in his own assessment made Soyinka's story less convincing. Omeben also claims he requested to interview Dan Agbese, Ray Ekpu and Kayode Soyinka. Of the three, only Agbese turned up, he was later to find out that Soyinka had fled the country. Omeben also recalled that in the course of his investigations he had cause to interrogate both Haliru Akilu and Tunde Togun. According to Omeben Akilu defended Giwa's invitation to the DMI by saying Giwa was invited to clarify statements he made to a New York daily which had been assessed as having potential to paint the country in a bad light in the international press. The only known interview Giwa gave to any New York daily was one published eight months earlier in a New York Times story about rising religious nationalism and extremism in Nigeria. On the issue of rising Islamic nationalism, Giwa gave this singular quote in the story, \"It's a dangerous, explosive trend...in the worst case, I see a situation where die-hard Christians and die-hard Moslems are fighting in the streets.\" Omeben said he was satisfied with the reasons Akilu and Togun gave for inviting Giwa.\n\nHowever, Soyinka has come out to reply Omeben and accused him of spreading deliberate falsehood with his comments on him on his involvement with the parcel bomb incident. In an interview he granted The Nation newspaper of Lagos of Saturday, 19 January 2013, Soyinka strongly denied that he ran to the toilet when the bomb exploded. He said he did not know where Omeben got that false information from. When questioned, Soyinka requested to not be required to relive the experience again.\n\nOmeben also alleged that he was being pressured into naming Babangida and Akilu as suspects when he yet had no evidence linking them to the crime. Some of this pressure led to the formation of a special squad to investigate the case, the squad was headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsav. Omeben alleges that the then Inspector General of Police Gambo Jimeta has asked him to leave the case with the Tsav team out of anger at how messy the whole situation was getting.\n\nOmeben also spoke about certain \"fixations\" in the minds of the general public about the case, in his own words \"...There is the tendency for people to make up their minds as to what they want to see or hear. It may not necessarily be the truth and once they are so fixated, every other thing that somebody else would say would not mean anything to them. Dele Giwa's case suffered such a fixation\".\n\nIn testimony that he gave on 3 July 2001 before the Justice Oputa led Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (HRVIC), Tsav alleged that the government stonewalled his investigation into the assassination. Tsav claimed that he was not granted permission to question key actors involved, including Tunde Togun, Ismaila Gwarzo and Haliru Akilu. He also said that he had requested that the privileges of these officers be withdrawn so he could take their statements and conduct a search of their offices and residences for items of evidential value but this request was denied. Tsav averred that in his final report, he had concluded that there was enough circumstantial evidence to accuse the duo of Togun and Akilu of conspiracy to murder but still the government did not make these two officers available for interrogation or a voice identification as he had requested.\n\nTsav claims that he handed the case file back to Chris Omeben. Tsav alleged that none of his recommendations were implemented, the case file was never returned to him and that there was no evidence that the case was transferred to another officer or agency. Tsav said he believed Giwa was killed because he believed Giwa was in \"the way of some powerful forces\".\n\nAfter the investigation stalled, various conspiracy theories arose to explain why Giwa was killed. One of the most popular and still the most enduring has been the Gloria Okon connection. Gloria Okon was a Lady who was arrested in 1985 at the Aminu Kano International airport on suspicion of drug smuggling. Soon after, the it was alleged that she had died in custody, the government subsequently constituted a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter.\n\nConspiracy theorists allege that Gloria Okon was a drug mule working for the wife of General Ibrahim Babangida who was then the Minister of Defence in the regime of General Muhammadu Buhari. The theorists allege that during interrogation Okon had claimed that she worked for highly placed Nigerians, in particular Babangida's wife. The theory goes on that Babangida spirited Okon out of detention to the United Kingdom, sold the public the ruse of a dead Gloria Okon and that Dele Giwa happened upon Okon on a trip to the UK where she told him her story. The story goes on that armed with this information, Giwa tried to blackmail the now Military President, Ibrahim Babangida and this was why he was killed. This blackmail theory might not be unconnected with the off-the-record interview that Lt Col A.K Togun gave to airport correspondents of the Guardian on 27 October 1986. In the interview, when asked about Dele Giwa's killing and the suspicion in the public that he was killed by the government, Togun was quoted as saying \"...one person cannot come out to blackmail us. I am an expert in blackmail. I can blackmail very well. I studied propaganda so no one person can come and blackmail us after an agreement...\". Togun's statement was in the context of the secret agreement reached by Giwa and other media executives at the 9 October meeting, he seemed to accuse Giwa of reneging on the agreement leading to Giwa being invited for questioning on 16 October. Theorists also allege that Babangida's drug running activities were brought to the attention of the Buhari-Idiagbon regime which led the regime to slate him for retirement on 1 October 1985. They also say that it was his impending retirement that inspired him to plan the coup that toppled Buhari in August 1985.\n\nGiwa's colleagues at \"Newswatch\" have debunked this theory and deny any link between Giwa, Gloria Okon and Mrs. Babangida. In a \"Newswatch\" interview marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the magazine, one of the founding partners of the organisation Yakubu Mohammed explained the Giwa-\"Newswatch\"-Gloria Okon link.\nMohammed claims that Dele Giwa had not been writing any Gloria Okon story and that the closest \"Newswatch\" got to a Gloria Okon story was at one of the magazine's editorial conferences where a \"Newswatch\" reporter, Bose lasaki, who was a niece to President Olusegun Obasanjo spoke about a \"rumour\" making the rounds to the effect that Gloria Okon had not died in detention but had been spirited out of the country. Mohammed claimed that Lasaki's story was dismissed off-hand but that she was asked to find out more about the rumour. Lasaki was alleged to have returned for the next editorial conference the following week and declared that there was no substance to the rumour. Mohammed alleged that Giwa was not at any of these meetings. The Ibrahim Babangida drug running angle was also called into question by revelations made by the embittered former head of the National Security Organization (NSO), Alhaji Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi. In 1985, following a request by the Supreme Military Council, the NSO under Rafindadi investigated Babangida and found him complicit of forgery and activities inimical to national security. This issue arose as a result of Babangida and his in-law, Mr Sunny Okogwu's interest in an arms manufacturing venture in Kaduna called Black Gold. The SMC, based on the NSO's findings slated Babangida for retirement.\nThe only witness to the events shortly before the bomb exploded, Mr Kayode Soyinka had alleged that the package had a label with the seal of the Nigerian President and also claimed that the label indicated that it was from the office of the president. However, no other witness has corroborated this claim, Giwa's 17-year-old son, Billy, who had delivered the package to Giwa has never corroborated this claim. Soyinka's testimony about the events prior to and after the bombing have also been brought into question, there have been accusations made to the effect that he might have been the same person that detonated the bomb by remote control as he was not injured in the explosion.\n\nSoyinka is also alleged to have given conflicting accounts of the events to the Police and media outlets, he is also accused of fleeing the country while investigations were ongoing. To the accusation of fleeing the country, Soyinka has this to say in that his interview with The Nation (Saturday, 19 January 2013): \"Dele was very close to his mother. He did not joke with her at all. It was an honour for me to have met her. The last time I saw her was at Dele's burial in their village near Auchi, in Edo State. I was there live with my wife contrary to the erroneous story of Babangida's government's mischief makers who tried to deceive the Nigerian people in order to exonerate the government from the assassination of Dele Giwa, saying that I had fled the country. They deliberately spread all kinds of falsehood, ignoring even newspaper reports and pictures of myself and my wife in attendance at the burial. And mind you, how could I have fled the country? My wife and children were not in Nigeria with me when the bomb exploded, they had to take the next available flight to Nigeria to join me. Yet, Babangida's men said I fled the country. And my family and I remained in the country throughout the whole period of the controversy and burial arrangement. We returned to London together through the former British Caledonian Airways, through Muritala Mohammed Airport. There was no way we could have left quietly. We were accompanied to and seen off at the airport by friends, including the \"Newswatch\" editors, and family. The airline people recognised us. Our two children were still small then. The air hostesses took them from us, played with them, and they were asking me if I was feeling better – knowing the trauma one must have been through in the past weeks, and took us straight and right inside the aircraft, even before checking in other passengers. Yet the Babangida men kept saying, even till today, that I fled the country. Can you imagine?\"\n\nGiwa's lawyer was also accused of prematurely accusing the government of Dele Giwa's murder thereby truncating the investigation into the case, \"Newswatch\" magazine in an edition of 5 November 1986 disowned Fawehimni.\n\nThe subsequent court cases instituted by Fawehinmi against the government to enable him try the case as a private prosecutor after the Director of Public Prosecution, Mrs. Eniola Fadayomi had refused to prosecute based on the evidence available were mostly unsuccessful. An excerpt of the Judgement by the then Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Candido Johnson reads thus \"...Even if one considers the reasonableness of time, I would say that the incident that gave birth to the death of the late Dele Giwa is not only unique in its form but also complex and would require sufficient time to conduct detailed and balanced investigation, a report on which the appropriate authority would reasonably act. The timing here appears hasty and premature. It appears impulsive without giving reasonable time and chance for a detailed and balanced investigation into this sordid incident.\nIn the circumstances and having regard to the review made above, it is my ruling that this (ex-parte) application is misconceived and it is therefore dismissed. Leave to apply for mandamus is hereby refused.\"\n\nFawehinmi went on to the Supreme Court and got a favourable judgement which enabled him go back to the Lagos State High Court, this judgement also mandated the Justice Candido to recuse himself from the case and appoint another judge to hear the case. On 23 February 1988, Justice Longe ruled that the two security officers, Lt. Col Tunde Togun and Col. Haliru Akilu could not be tried for the murder of Dele Giwa.

Based on the evidence available before the court, it will be an abuse of the process of court to call the two security chiefs for trial. The information is therefore quashed accordingly.\" Kayode Soyinka was represented in court by Kayode Sofola SAN, representing the chambers of Kehinde Sofola SAN, that succeeded to getting the court to rule as frivolous the reference to Soyinka being \"implicated\".

The city and its council were established on February 4, 1960 by means of Private Bill 125 of the Twenty-Fifth Legislature of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (now National Assembly of Quebec).\n\nSince June 1962, regular sittings are held once a month at the Garth House, 100 Grande Cote, Lorraine, Quebec. The agenda for each meeting is not published in advance resulting in low citizen attendance.\n\nThe bill stated that the first aldermen were to be:\n\nThe first sitting of the Council occurred on May 9, 1960; John J.

{"id": "2231248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231248", "title": "List of current world boxing champions", "text": "List of current world boxing champions\n\nThis is a list of current world boxing champions. Since at least John L. Sullivan, in the late 19th century, there have been world champions in professional boxing. The first of the current organizations to award a world title was the World Boxing Association (WBA), then known as the National Boxing Association (NBA), when it sanctioned its first title fight in 1921 between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier for the world heavyweight championship.\n\nThere are now four major sanctioning bodies in professional boxing. The official rules and regulations of the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), International Boxing Federation (IBF), and World Boxing Organization (WBO) all recognize each other in their rankings and title unification rules. Each of these organizations sanction and regulate championship bouts and award world titles. American boxing magazine \"The Ring\" began awarding world titles in 1922.\n\nThere are seventeen weight divisions. To compete in a division, a boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in eight different weight divisions, more than any other boxer. The Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir, held all four major titles in the heavyweight division from 2011 to 2013; they were the first brothers to hold versions of the heavyweight championship at the same time. Joe Louis holds the record of being the longest reigning world champion in boxing.\nWhen a champion, for reasons beyond his control such as an illness or injury, is unable to defend his title within the normal mandatory time, the sanctioning bodies may order an interim title bout and award the winner an interim championship. The WBA and WBC have often changed the status of their inactive champions to a \"Champion in Recess\" or \"Champion Emeritus\".\n\nThe World Boxing Association (WBA) was founded in 1921 as the National Boxing Association (NBA), a national regulating body of the United States. On August 23, 1962, the NBA became the WBA, which today has its head office in Panama. According to WBA championship rules, when a champion also holds a title of one of the other three major sanctioning bodies in an equivalent weight division, that boxer is granted a special recognition of \"Unified Champion\", and is given more time between mandatory title defences. The WBA Championships Committee and President may also designate a champion as a \"Super Champion\" or \"Undisputed Champion\" in exceptional circumstances; the standard WBA title is then vacated and contested between WBA-ranked contenders. When a WBA \"Regular Champion\" makes between five and ten successful defences, he may be granted the WBA \"Super\" title upon discretion of a vote of the WBA's board of governors.\n\nThe World Boxing Council (WBC) was founded in Mexico City, Mexico on February 14, 1963 in order to establish an international regulating body. The WBC established many of today's safety measures in boxing, such as the standing eight count, a limit of 12 rounds instead of 15, and additional weight divisions. More information about the WBC's other titles including \"Silver\", \"Diamond\", \"Emeritus\", \"Franchise\", \"Honorary\", and \"Supreme Champion\" can be read at the WBC article.\n\nThe International Boxing Federation (IBF) originated in September 1976 as the United States Boxing Association (USBA) when American members of the WBA withdrew in order to legitimize boxing in the United States with \"unbiased\" ratings. In April 1983, the organization established an international division that was known as the United States Boxing Association-International (USBA-I). In May 1984, the New Jersey-based USBA-I was renamed and became the IBF.\n\nThe World Boxing Organization (WBO) was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico (which is a self-governing commonwealth of the United States) in 1988. In its early years the WBO's titles were not widely recognized. By 2012 when the Japan Boxing Commission officially recognized the governing body, it had gained similar status to the other three major sanctioning bodies. Its motto is \"dignity, democracy, honesty.\" When a WBO champion has reached \"preeminent status\", the WBO's Executive Committee may designate him as a \"Super Champion\". However, this is only an honorary title and not the same as the WBA's policy of having separate \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions. A WBO \"Super Champion\" cannot win or lose that recognition in the ring; it is merely awarded by the WBO.\n\nThe boxing magazine \"The Ring\" awards its own belts. The original title sequence began from the magazine's first publication in the 1920s until its titles were placed on hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When \"The Ring\" started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion. Cyber Boxing Zone commented in 2004 that \"\"The Ring\" has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\".\n\nIn 2007, \"The Ring\" was acquired by the owners of fight promoter Golden Boy Promotions, which has publicized \"The Ring\"'s world championships when they are at stake in fights it promotes (such as Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones Jr. in 2008). Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, \"The Ring\" allows fights between a number one or two contender; or alternatively a number three, four, or five contender to fill a vacant title. This has prompted further doubts about its credibility. Some boxing journalists have been extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed, the \"Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\n\nThe current champions in each weight division are listed below. Each champion's professional boxing record is shown in the following format: wins–losses–draws (knockout wins).\n\n"}

{"id": "2231257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231257", "title": "Jim Hacker", "text": "Jim Hacker\n\nJames George Hacker, Baron Hacker of Islington, KG, PC, BSc (Lond.), Hon. DCL (Oxon.) is a fictional character in the 1980s British sitcom \"Yes Minister\" and its sequel, \"Yes, Prime Minister\". He is the Minister of the (fictional) Department of Administrative Affairs, and later the Prime Minister. He was portrayed by Paul Eddington in the original show; in the 2013 revival he was portrayed by David Haig.\n\nHacker was an academic political researcher, polytechnic lecturer, and editor of a newspaper, \"Reform\", and entered Parliament circa 1961. He continued with at least some of these jobs while holding the office of Member of Parliament for Birmingham East.\n\nFor the first twenty years of his political career, Hacker was a member of the Opposition, and he served as Shadow Minister of Agriculture from 1974 on. In 1980, he served as the head of the unsuccessful party leadership campaign of Martin Walker; the winner of this campaign, Herbert Attwell, later went on to win the general election in 1981, and thereby became the UK's new prime minister. Hacker was nervous that Attwell would pass him over for a Cabinet post as an act of revenge for running Walker's campaign against him, but Attwell appointed Hacker to the cabinet as minister for the (fictitious) Department of Administrative Affairs. At least one news commentator of the time speculated that the appointment \"was\" actually an act of revenge, as the DAA had a reputation as \"a political graveyard\" that could end Hacker's career.\n\nIn \"Yes Minister\", Hacker is joined by the ministry's Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, who as a senior civil servant tries to control the ministry and the minister himself, and also by his Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley. Hacker received his degree, a third, from the London School of Economics, and is frequently derided for this by the Oxford-educated Sir Humphrey. He and his wife, Annie, have one daughter, Lucy, a sociology student at the University of Sussex who plays a major role in the first series episode \"The Right to Know\".\n\nHacker gains an honorary doctorate from Baillie College, Oxford (a possible reference to Balliol College), in the second series episode \"Doing the Honours\". During the Christmas special episode, \"Party Games\", he is Party Chair, which gives him the opportunity – with the help of Sir Humphrey and other civil servants acting in their own interests – to become Prime Minister in an episode broadcast in 1985 (but according to the book adaptation, set in 1984).\n\n\"Yes, Prime Minister\" follows on from this, with Hacker and Sir Humphrey raised to the highest levels in British government: Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary respectively. Bernard remains Hacker's principal private secretary throughout.\n\nAn obituary for Hacker, written by his creators, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, appears in \"Politico's Book of the Dead\". The entry gives Hacker the same dates of birth and death as Paul Eddington, the actor who portrayed him. (These dates make Hacker 53 at the time of broadcast of the episode \"Open Government\", although this episode states that he is in his late forties.) Although the series itself ends with Hacker still Prime Minister, this obituary mentions his later career as a member of the House of Lords. After his death, a college is named after him (Hacker College, Oxford).\n\nJim Hacker first appears in \"Yes Minister\" having been recently re-elected as Member of Parliament for Birmingham East, soundly defeating his opponents. His early character is that of a very gung-ho, albeit naive, politician, ready to bring sweeping change into his department, unaware that Sir Humphrey and the civil service are out to stop any semblance of change, despite their insistence that they are his allies. Hacker is also noted as having challenged Humphrey while he was a member of the Opposition by asking difficult questions when Sir Humphrey was testifying to a Parliamentary committee: Sir Humphrey stated that Hacker had asked \"...all the questions I hoped nobody would ask,\" showing his new Minister to be at least a reasonably capable politician.\n\nBefore long, Hacker begins to notice that the Civil Service has been preventing any of his changes from actually being put into practice. Bernard is sympathetic to Hacker's plight and tries to enlighten his Minister as to the tricks and techniques employed by government staff, but his ability to help is limited by his own loyalties in the Civil Service. Hacker soon learns and becomes more sly and cynical, using some of these ploys himself. While Sir Humphrey nearly always gets the upper hand, Hacker now and again plays a trump card, and on even fewer occasions, the two of them work towards a common goal.\n\nHacker also learns that his efforts to change the government or Britain are all really for naught, as he discovers in the episode \"The Whisky Priest\", when he attempts to stop the export of British-made munitions to Italian terrorists.\n\nThroughout \"Yes Minister\", there are many occasions when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually concerned with what the newspapers of the day will have to say about him, and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election – his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted.\n\nJust prior to the start of \"Yes, Prime Minister\", Hacker shows a zeal for making speeches and presents himself as a viable party leader after the Prime Minister announces his resignation in the episode \"Party Games\". He is given embarrassing information about the two front-runner candidates, and manages to persuade them (by insinuating that secret information pertaining to both may be revealed to the public) to drop out of the race, and lend their support to him. With help from the recently promoted Sir Humphrey and other senior civil servants, Hacker emerges as a compromise candidate and becomes head of his party unopposed – and Prime Minister.\n\nIn \"Yes, Prime Minister\" Hacker strives to perfect all the skills needed by a statesman, giving more grandiose speeches, dreaming up \"courageous\" political programmes, and honing his diplomatic craft, nearly all of these attempts landing him in trouble at some point.\n\nIn a \"Radio Times\" interview to promote the latter series, Paul Eddington stated, \"He's beginning to find his feet as a man of power, and he's begun to confound those who thought they'd be able to manipulate him out of hand.\"\n\nHacker becomes a more competent politician by the end. Though primarily interested in his personal career survival and advancement, he, unlike Sir Humphrey, views government as a means rather than an end in itself.\n\nHacker has many prominent habits that feature throughout the series:\n\nHacker's political party is never explicitly stated – a deliberate ploy by the series' creators to prevent the show from having a partisan affiliation. This begins in the very first scene of the 'Yes Minister' pilot episode, where the victorious Hacker's party rosette is white, as opposed to the red (for Labour) and blue (for the Conservatives) rosettes worn by the other candidates. The Labour and Conservative parties are eventually compared in \"The National Education Service\", when Sir Humphrey tells Bernard, \"When there is a Labour government, the education authorities tell them that comprehensives abolish the class system and when there's a Tory government we tell them that it's the cheapest way of providing mass education; to Labour we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.\" but Sir Humphrey then goes on to tell Hacker neither of these things, forgoing any suggestion that Hacker is from either party. Throughout the show, Hacker's political opinions tend towards reform of administration and are neither left nor right wing. However, the concentration on \"making budget cuts (of 5%)\" in the \"Yes Minister\" episode \"Doing the Honours\" and cutting taxes in the \"Yes Prime Minister\" episode \"The Smoke Screen\" allude towards him being a conservative; and the writers have since established that they privately saw Hacker as a centrist \"wet\" Conservative.\n\nIn a radio broadcast spoof of \"Yes Minister\" performed by both Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne, both of whom played their respective parts from the show, Hacker is a Minister in the government of the day, that of Margaret Thatcher, who also played herself as Prime Minister. In the sketch, she asks that Hacker and Sir Humphrey abolish economists.\n\nIn the 2010 stage production of \"Yes, Prime Minister\", the role was played by David Haig; Graham Seed took the role in a touring production of the play.\n"}
{"id": "2231258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231258", "title": "BMW K100", "text": "BMW K100\n\nThe BMW K100 is a family of four-cylinder 987 cc motorcycles that were manufactured by BMW from 1983 to 1992.\n\nAs the 1970s came to an end, BMW faced three problems from developing its flat-twin boxer engine further:\n\nIn combination, this meant that BMW's marketing to users of a superior bike, allowing them to price at a premium, was being quickly lost, resulting in a loss of sales and market share.\n\nAt the time, BMW, Moto Guzzi and Harley-Davidson were the only major \"high end\" manufacturers that did not offer liquid-cooled engines. Competing brands, notably of Japanese manufacture, were touting the superiority of their liquid-cooled engines and had introduced low maintenance shaft-drive technology in a growing number of their models.\n\nBMW needed to develop a clean burning four-cylinder engine quickly. While a flat-four engine would have been suited to their boxer tradition and experience, it would also give the appearance that they were copying Honda's GL1000 Gold Wing.\n\nIn 1977, Josef Fritzenwenger presented a prototype using a PSA-Renault X-Type engine from a Peugeot 104. The engine, which was installed in the 104 at a 72° angle, was laid flat in the frame with the crankshaft on the right, running parallel to the centre line of the frame. This layout, for which BMW submitted a patent application, was well suited to BMW's traditional shaft drive, needing only one 90° bevel drive to transmit power to the rear wheel. Using shaft drive with the near-vertical transverse engine preferred by the Japanese manufacturers at the time would have needed two 90° bevel drives, doubling the power lost to the inefficiency of these units. The new layout also kept the bike's centre of gravity low, which improved the bike's handling, and made space behind the front wheel available for the radiator.\n\nFritzwenger's concept was developed by a team led by Stefan Pachernegg based on criteria set out by R. P. Michel and K. V. Gevert. Martin Probst, who had earlier worked with the development of BMW's Formula Two engine, was responsible for engine testing and development.\n\nAs an automobile manufacturer, BMW had about twenty years of experience with liquid cooled overhead camshaft inline engines. This was carried over to the K100 engine, which used a Bosch LE-Jetronic fuel injection similar to that being introduced on their second generation 3 Series cars. Replacing the Bing carburettors traditionally used on BMW motorcycles, the fuel injection system increased power, broadened and smoothed the powerband, and reduced fuel consumption, partly by shutting off fuel under deceleration to 2000 rpm. The engine also featured a breakerless electronic ignition system.\n\nThe engine was positioned with the crankshaft on the right-hand side of the motorcycle and the cylinder head, camshafts, injectors and spark plugs on the left-hand side. This improved access to the engine over that of a conventional design, where the crankshaft would be at the bottom and the cylinder head and associated parts would be between the engine block and the upper frame.\n\nThe BMW K75 is a standard motorcycle produced by BMW Motorrad from 1985 to 1995.\n\nThe three-cylinder BMW K75 was developed alongside the K100, but was introduced a year after the K100 as a marketing strategy. The K75 engine had the same bore and stroke as the K100, yielding a displacement of 740 cc. Its crankshaft had 120° between the throws and was counterbalanced by balance weights added to the water pump accessory shaft, which ran at engine speed as is correct for a 120° straight-three engine. The balance shaft made the K75's engine smoother than the K100's engine. To increase the smaller engine's power, the K75's engine was given longer valve timing, the compression ratio was increased to 11.0:1 from the K100's 10.2:1, the combustion chambers were redesigned, the intake manifold was shortened, and the exhaust system was retuned. The US market engine, specified to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, produced ; engines for all other markets produced .\nThe front engine mounts on the K75 frame are placed further back than in the K100 frame and the downtubes are at a different angle; otherwise the frames are identical. The K75 had the same wheelbase, seat height, and steering geometry as the K100. According to BMW, 80 percent of the K75's parts are interchangeable with the K100's. The K75's radiator and fuel tank were smaller than those on the K100.\n\nA single-sided hollow swingarm enclosing the drive shaft provides right side drive through the gearbox and to the rear wheel. The 4-into-1 all stainless steel exhaust exits on the left hand side.\n\nBrakes are two-piston Brembo callipers onto undrilled discs. Two different fork manufactures are used: Showa with an outer upper tube diameter of and Fichtel and Sachs measuring .\n\n\nAll K100 models have dual front and single rear disk brakes. The RS model has taller gearing than other models.\n\nThe K-series has additional refinements including aluminium fuel tanks, adjustable headlights, high capacity 460 watt alternators, Hella accessory plug-in, and self-cancelling turn signal lights.\n\n\nThe S and RT versions have a rear disc brake and 17\" rear wheels, whereas the others have a single leading shoe drum brake and 18\" rear wheels. A stiffer \"anti-dive\" front suspension was added to the S and RT models. The later RT versions had an adjustable windshield that could be raised and lowered. Some taller riders complained of wind buffeting with the smaller S model stock windscreens.\n\nThe same team would later develop an improved four-valve-per-cylinder head for the aerodynamic K1. In later models, the standard swingarm was replaced with a Paralever as on the K1. The LE Jetronic fuel injection system with separate ignition management was replaced by Motronic engine management with the introduction of four-valve cylinder heads with the 1990 K1 and the 1991 K100RS.\n\nAnti-lock brakes (ABS) were developed for K100 and K75 motorcycles and were installed on later models, which were among the first production motorcycles with this feature.\n\nIn 1993, the fork used on the K75S was replaced by a Showa fork. In 1994, the electrical system was given a larger 700 watt alternator and a smaller 19 Ah battery. For 1995 anti-lock braking was standard on the K75S. Two different forks manufacturers were used: Showa with an outer upper tube diameter of and Fichtel and Sachs measuring .\n\nAlthough sales were initially modest, buyers eventually warmed to the multi-cylinder BMWs. The K100 was a relative sales success, stemming the losses to the Japanese and changing the media and public perception of BMW.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine suffered from secondary vibration, but the three-cylinder K75, with its balance shaft, was far smoother. The engineers had anticipated this, and had designed in excellent vibration isolation, but it was the only technical glitch.\n\nThe competition were never far behind in performance on launch, updates were modest, while engine performance was stepped up with the September 1988 launch of the radically aerodynamic BMW K1.\n\n"}

The EP received a mixed-to-favorable response from music critics.\n\nThe EP's title reflects frontman Jason Lytle's frustration with his hometown, Modesto, California, and has been described as \"not so much a farewell as a fuck off to the town\". The name comes from something Lytle saw on the vanity license plate of a large truck in Modesto. In Lytle's words, the EP \"was a nice opportunity for me to produce some whiney little complaining songs about my hometown. I think it's pretty blatant; it's pretty stripped down in terms of the message.\" It was recorded simultaneously with \"Just Like the Fambly Cat\", and Lytle planned to leave Modesto as soon as the album was complete, stating \"In Modesto, it's like gravity is a lot heavier.

A limited-pressing vinyl edition was released by record label Devil in the Woods, containing the bonus track \"Hidden Health Announcement\".\n\n\"Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla\" received mixed-to-favorable reviews from critics.\n\nMarc Hogan of Pitchfork gave it 5.6/10, calling it \"a goofy, sloppy mini-album, cramming familiar Weezer fuzz, stoned piano ballads, playful analogue synths, and misguided Bad Company references into a little more than half an hour\". Gareth Dobson of Drowned in Sound gave it five out of ten, calling it a \"mixed bag\". \"SPIN\" gave it a B+ rating, calling it \"richly illustrated, grim but empathetic, epic yet humane art rock\". In the view of Joey Lipps of \"The Michigan Daily\", \"it falls short of the captivating quality of their previous recordings\". Shilpa Ganatra of \"Hot Press\" opined that the EP represented \"a wander into the field of revolution rather than evolution\".\n"}

In particular, a universally measurable set of reals is necessarily Lebesgue measurable (see below).\n\nEvery analytic set is universally measurable. It follows from projective determinacy, which in turn follows from sufficient large cardinals, that every projective set is universally measurable.\n\nThe condition that the measure be a probability measure; that is, that the measure of formula_2 itself be 1, is less restrictive than it may appear. For example, Lebesgue measure on the reals is not a probability measure, yet every universally measurable set is Lebesgue measurable. To see this, divide the real line into countably many intervals of length 1; say, \"N\"=<nowiki>[0,1)</nowiki>, \"N\"=<nowiki>[1,2)</nowiki>, \"N\"=<nowiki>[-1,0)</nowiki>, \"N\"=<nowiki>[2,3)</nowiki>, \"N\"=<nowiki>[-2,-1)</nowiki>, and so on. Now letting μ be Lebesgue measure, define a new measure ν by\nThen easily ν is a probability measure on the reals, and a set is ν-measurable if and only if it is Lebesgue measurable. More generally a universally measurable set must be measurable with respect to every sigma-finite measure that measures all Borel sets.\n\nSuppose formula_1 is a subset of Cantor space formula_8; that is, formula_1 is a set of infinite sequences of zeroes and ones. By putting a binary point before such a sequence, the sequence can be viewed as a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive), with some unimportant ambiguity. Thus we can think of formula_1 as a subset of the interval <nowiki>[0,1]</nowiki>, and evaluate its Lebesgue measure, if that is defined. That value is sometimes called the coin-flipping measure of formula_1, because it is the probability of producing a sequence of heads and tails that is an element of formula_1 upon flipping a fair coin infinitely many times.\n\nNow it follows from the axiom of choice that there are some such formula_1 without a well-defined Lebesgue measure (or coin-flipping measure). That is, for such an formula_1, the probability that the sequence of flips of a fair coin will wind up in formula_1 is not well-defined. This is a pathological property of formula_1 that says that formula_1 is \"very complicated\" or \"ill-behaved\".\n\nFrom such a set formula_1, form a new set formula_19 by performing the following operation on each sequence in formula_1: Intersperse a 0 at every even position in the sequence, moving the other bits to make room. Although formula_19 is not intuitively any \"simpler\" or \"better-behaved\" than formula_1, the probability that the sequence of flips of a fair coin will be in formula_19 is well-defined. Indeed, to be in formula_19, the coin must come up tails on every even-numbered flip, which happens with probability zero.\n\nHowever formula_19 is \"not\" universally measurable. To see that, we can test it against a \"biased\" coin that always comes up tails on even-numbered flips, and is fair on odd-numbered flips. For a set of sequences to be \"universally\" measurable, an arbitrarily \"biased\" coin may be used (even one that can \"remember\" the sequence of flips that has gone before) and the probability that the sequence of its flips ends up in the set must be well-defined. However, when formula_19 is tested by the coin we mentioned (the one that always comes up tails on even-numbered flips, and is fair on odd-numbered flips), the propability to hit formula_19 is not well defined (for the same reason why formula_1 cannot be tested by the fair coin). Thus the formula_19 is \"not\" universally measurable.\n\n"}
