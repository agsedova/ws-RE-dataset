{"id": "2051567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051567", "title": "Classical compound", "text": "Classical compound\n\nClassical compounds and neoclassical compounds are compound words composed from combining forms (which act as affixes or stems) derived from classical Latin or ancient Greek roots. New Latin comprises many such words and is a substantial component of the technical and scientific lexicon of English and other languages, including international scientific vocabulary. For example, \"bio-\" combines with \"-graphy\" to form \"biography\" (\"life\" + \"writing/recording\").\n\nClassical compounds represent a significant source of Neo-Latin vocabulary. Moreover, since these words are composed from classical languages whose prestige is or was respected throughout the Western European culture, these words typically appear in many different languages. Their widespread use makes technical writing generally accessible to readers who may only have a smattering of the language in which it appears.\n\nNot all Western European languages have been equally receptive to classical technical compounds. German and Russian, for instance, have historically attempted to create their own technical vocabularies from native elements. Usually, these creations are German and Russian calques on the international vocabulary, such as \"Wasserstoff\" and \"водород\" (\"vodoród\") for \"hydrogen\". Like any exercise in language prescription, this endeavour has been only partially successful, so while official German may still speak of a \"Fernsprecher\", public telephones will be labelled with the internationally recognized \"Telefon\".\n\nThese words are compounds formed from Latin and Ancient Greek root words. Ancient Greek words are almost invariably romanized (see transliteration of Ancient Greek into English). In English: \nThus, for example, Ancient Greek \"σφιγξ\" becomes English (and Latin) \"sphinx\". Exceptions to these romanizing rules occur, such as \"leukemia (leukaemia)\"; compare \"leukocyte\", also \"leucocyte\". In Latin, and in the target languages, the Greek vowels are given their classical values rather than their contemporary values in demotic Greek.\n\nAncient Greek words often contain consonant clusters which are foreign to the phonology of contemporary English and other languages that incorporate these words into their lexicon: \"diphthong\"; \"pneumatology\", \"phthisis\". The traditional response in English is to treat the unfamiliar cluster as containing one or more silent letters and suppress their pronunciation, more \"modern\" speakers tend to try and pronounce the unusual cluster. This adds to the irregularities of English spelling; moreover, since many of these words are encountered in writing more often than they are heard spoken, it introduces uncertainty as to how to pronounce them when encountered.\n\nClassical compounds frequently vary their stressed syllable when suffixes are added: \"ágriculture, agricúltural.\" This also gives rise to uncertainty when these words are encountered in print. Once a classical compound has been created and borrowed, it typically becomes the foundation of a whole series of related words: e.g. \"astrology, astrological, astrologer/astrologist/astrologian, astrologism\".\n\nMainstream medical New Latin and ISV pronunciation in English is not the same as Classical Latin pronunciation. Like Ecclesiastical Latin, it has a regularity of its own, and individual sounds can be mapped or compared. Although the Classical Latin pronunciation of \"venae cavae\" would be approximately , the standard English medical pronunciation is .\n\nEnglish began incorporating many of these words in the sixteenth century; \"geography\" first appeared in an English text in 1535. Other early adopted words that still survive include \"mystagogue\", from the 1540s, and \"androgyne\", from the 1550s. The use of these technical terms predates the scientific method; the several varieties of divination all take their names from Classical compounds, such as \"alectryomancy\", divination by the pecking of chickens.\n\nNot all English writers have been friendly to the inflow of Classical vocabulary. The Tudor period writer Sir John Cheke wrote:\n\nand therefore rejected what he called \"inkhorn terms\".\n\nSimilar sentiments moved the nineteenth century author William Barnes to write \"pure English,\" in which he avoided Greco-Latin words and find Anglo-Saxon equivalents therefor: for Barnes, the newly invented art of the \"photograph\" became a \"sun-print\". Unlike this one, some of Barnes's coinages caught on, such as \"foreword\", Barnes's replacement for the \"preface\" of a book. Later, Poul Anderson wrote a jocular piece called \"Uncleftish Beholding\" in a constructed language based on English which others have called \"Ander-Saxon\"; this attempted to create a pure English vocabulary for nuclear physics. For more information, see Linguistic purism in English.\n\nMany such words, such as \"thermometer\", \"dinosaur\", \"rhinoceros\", and \"rhododendron\", are thoroughly incorporated into the English lexicon and are the ordinary words for their referents. Some are prone to colloquial shortening; \"rhinoceros\" often becomes \"rhino\". The binomial nomenclature of taxonomy and biology is a major source for these items of vocabulary; for many unfamiliar species that lack a common English name, the name of the genus becomes the English word for that life form.\n\nIn the metric system, prefixes that indicate multipliers are typically Greek in origin, such as \"kilogram\", while those that indicate divisors are Latin, as in \"millimeter\": the base roots resemble Greek words, but in truth are neologisms. These metric and other suffixes are added to native English roots as well, resulting in creations such as \"gigabyte\". Words of mixed Latin and Greek lineage, or words that combine elements of the classical languages with English – so-called hybrid words – were formerly castigated as \"barbarisms\" by prescriptionist usage commentators; this disapproval has mostly abated. Indeed, in scientific nomenclature, even more exotic hybrids have appeared, such as for example the dinosaur \"Yangchuanosaurus\". Personal names appear in some scientific names such as \"Fuchsia\".\n\nClassical compounds are sometimes used to lend grandeur or the impression of scientific rigour to humble pursuits: the study of \"cosmetology\" will not help anyone become an \"astronaut\". Compounds along these models are also sometimes coined for humorous effect, such as \"odontopodology\", the science of putting your foot into your mouth. These humorous coinages sometimes take on a life of their own, such as \"garbology\", the study of garbage.\n\nSome classical compounds form classical plurals, and are therefore irregular in English. Others do not, while some vacillate between classical and regular plurals.\n\nThere are hundreds of classical compounds in English and other European languages. As traditionally defined, they cannot stand alone as free words, but there are many exceptions to this rule, and in the late 20th century such forms are increasingly used independently: \"bio\" as a clipping of \"biography\", \"telly\" as a respelt clipping of \"television\". Most classical compounds translate readily into everyday language, especially nouns: \"bio-\" as ‘life’ \"-graphy\" as ‘writing, description’. Because of this, the compounds of which they are part (usually \"classical\" or \"learned compounds\") can be more or less straightforwardly paraphrased: \"biography\" as ‘writing about a life’, \"neurology\" as ‘the study of the nervous system’. Many classical compounds are designed to take initial or final position: \"autobiography\" has the two initial or preposed forms \"auto-\", \"bio-\", and one postposed form \"-graphy\". Although most occupy one position or the other, some can occupy both: \"-graph-\" as in \"graphology\" and \"monograph\"; \"-phil-\" as in \"philology\" and \"Anglophile\". Occasionally, the same base is repeated in one word: \"logology\" the study of words, \"phobophobia\" the fear of fear.\n\nPrefixes include: \"aero-\" air, \"crypto-\" hidden, \"demo-\" people, \"geo-\" earth, \"odonto-\" tooth, \"ornitho-\" bird, \"thalasso\" sea. Many have both a traditional simple meaning and a modern telescopic meaning: in \"biology\", \"bio-\" means ‘life’, but in \"bio-degradable\" it telescopes ‘biologically’; although \"hypno-\" basically means ‘sleep’ (\"hypnopaedia\" learning through sleep), it also stands for ‘hypnosis’ (\"hypnotherapy\" cure through hypnosis).\n\nWhen a form stands alone as a present-day word, it is usually a telescopic abbreviation: \"bio\" biography, \"chemo\" chemotherapy, \"hydro\" hydroelectricity, \"metro\" metropolitan. Some telescoped forms can be shorter than the original classical compounds: \"gynie\" is shorter than \"gyneco-\" and stands for both \"gynecology\" and \"gynecologist\"; \"anthro\" is shorter than \"anthropo-\" and stands for \"anthropology\".\n\nSuffixes include: \"-ectomy\" cutting out, \"-graphy\" writing, description, \"-kinesis\" motion, \"-logy\" study, \"-mancy\" divination, \"-onym\" name, \"-phagy\" eating, \"-phony\" sound, \"-therapy\" healing, \"-tomy\" cutting. They are generally listed in dictionaries without the interfixed vowel, which appears however in such casual phrases as ‘ologies and isms’.\n\nSome classical compounds are variants of one base.\n\nSome are also free words, such as \"mania\" in \"dipsomania\" and \"phobia\" in \"claustrophobia\".\n\nSome are composites of other elements, such as \"encephalo-\" brain, from \"en-\" in, \"-cephal-\" head; and \"-ectomy\" cutting out, from \"ec-\" out, \"-tom-\" cut, \"-y\", a noun-forming suffix that means \"process of\".\n\nIn Greek and Latin grammar, combining bases usually require a thematic or stem-forming vowel. In \"biography\", from Greek, the thematic is -\"o\"-; in \"agriculture\", from Latin, it is \"-i-\". In English morphology, this vowel can be considered as an interfix: \"-o-\", in \"miniskirt\", the interfix \"-i-\". It is usually regarded as attached to the initial base (\"bio-\", \"mini-\") rather than the final base (\"-graphy\", \"-skirt\"), but in forms where it is conventionally stressed, it is sometimes considered as part of the final base (\"-ography\", \"-ology\"). If the final element begins with a vowel (for example, \"-archy\" as in \"monarchy\"), the mediating vowel has traditionally been avoided (not *\"monoarchy\"), but in recent coinages it is often kept, sometimes accompanied by a hyphen (\"auto-analysis\", \"bioenergy\", \"hydroelectricity\", not *\"autanalysis\", *\"bienergy\", *\"hydrelectricity\").\n\nIts presence helps to distinguish classical compounds like \"biography\" and \"agriculture\" from vernacular compounds like \"teapot\" and \"blackbird\".\n\nGenerally, English has acquired its classical compounds in three ways: through French from Latin and Greek, directly from Latin and Greek, and by coinage in English on Greek and Latin patterns. An exception is \"schizophrenia\", which came into English through German, and is therefore pronounced ‘skitso’, not ‘skyzo’.\n\nFrom the Renaissance until the mid-20th century, the concept of derivational purity has generally regulated the use of classical compounds: Greek with Greek, Latin with Latin, and a minimum of hybridization. \"Biography\" is Greek, \"agriculture\" Latin, but \"television\" is a hybrid of Greek \"tele-\" and Latin \"-vision\" (probably so coined because the ‘pure’ form \"telescope\" had already been adopted for another purpose). Most dictionaries follow the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in using \"combining form\" (\"comb. form\") to label such classical elements, but the name is not widely known. In appendices to dictionaries and grammar books, classical compounds are often loosely referred to as roots or affixes: ‘a logo …, properly speaking, is not a word at all but a prefix meaning word and short for logogram, a symbol, much as telly is short for television’ (Montreal \"Gazette\", 13 Apr. 1981). They are often referred to as affixes because some come first and some come last, but if they were affixes, a word like \"biography\" would have no base whatever. While affixes are grammatical (like prepositions), classical compounds are lexical (like nouns, adjectives, and verbs): for example, \"bio-\" translates as a noun (life), \"-graphy\" as a verbal noun (writing). They are also often loosely called roots because they are ancient and have a basic role in word formation, but functionally and often structurally they are distinct from roots: the \"-graph\" in \"autograph\" is both a root and a classical compound, while the \"-graphy\" in \"cryptography\" consists of root \"-graph-\" and suffix \"-y\", and is only a classical compound.\n\nGenerally, classical compounds were a closed system from the 16th century to the earlier 20th century: the people who used them were classically educated, their teachers and exemplars generally took a purist's view on their use, contexts of use were mainly technical, and there was relatively little seepage into the language at large. However, with the decline of classical education and the spread of technical and quasitechnical jargon in the media, a continuum has evolved, with at least five stages:\n\nIn the older sciences, classical compounds are generally used to form such strictly classical and usually Greek compounds as \"anthocyanin\", \"astrobleme\", \"chemotherapy\", \"chronobiology\", \"cytokinesis\", \"glossolalia\", \"lalophobia\", \"narcolepsy\", \"osteoporosis\", \"Pliohippus\", \"sympathomimetic\".\n\nIn technical, semitechnical, and quasitechnical usage at large, coiners of compounds increasingly treat Latin and Greek as one resource to produce such forms as \"accelerometer\", \"aero-generator\", \"bioprospector\", \"communicology\", \"electroconductive\", \"futurology\", \"mammography\", \"micro-gravity\", \"neoliberal\", \"Scientology\", \"servomechanism\".\n\nIn the later 20th century, many forms have cut loose from ancient moorings: \"crypto-\" as in preposed \"Crypto-Fascist\" and \"pseudo-\" as in \"pseudoradical\"; postposed \"-meter\" in \"speedometer\", \"clapometer\". Processes of analogy have created coinages like \"petrodollar\", \"psycho-warfare\", \"microwave\" on such models as \"petrochemical\", \"psychology\", \"microscope\". Such stunt usages as \"eco-doom\", \"eco-fears\", \"eco-freaks\", common in journalism, often employ classical compounds telescopically: \"eco-\" standing for \"ecology\" and \"ecological\" and not as used in \"economics\". In such matters, precision of meaning is secondary to compactness and vividness of expression.\n\nIn recent years, the orthography of many word forms has changed, usually without affecting pronunciation and stress. The same spoken usage may be written \"micro-missile\", \"micro missile\", \"micromissile\", reflecting the same uncertainty or flexibility as in \"businessman\", \"business-man\", \"business man\". When used in such ways, classical compounds are often telescopic: \"Hydro substation\" Hydro-Electricity Board substation, \"Metro highways\" Metropolitan highways, \"porno cult\" pornography cult.\n\nThe mix of late 20c techno-commercial coinages includes three groups of post- and non-classical forms: (1) \"Established forms\": \"econo-\" from ‘economic’, as in \"econometric\", \"Econo-Car\", \"mini-\" from ‘miniature’, as in \"miniskirt\", \"mini-boom\", \"-matic\" from ‘automatic’, as in \"Adjustamatic\", \"Instamatic\", \"Stackomatic\". (2) Less established forms, often created by blending: \"accu-\" from ‘accurate’, as in \"Accuvision\"; \"compu-\" from ‘computer’, as in \"Compucorp\"; \"docu-\" from ‘documentary’, as in \"docudrama\"; \"perma-\" from ‘permanent’, as in \"permafrost\" and \"permaban\"; \"dura-\" from ‘durable’, as in \"Duramark\". (3) Informal vernacular material in pseudo-classical form: \"Easibird\", \"Healthitone\", \"Redi-pak\", \"Relax-A-Cizor\" (relax, exerciser).\n\nWord forms exist for describing relations or interactions between two nations or societies, such as \"Anglo-French\" (England and France), Franco-Italian (France and Italy), Greco-Turkish (Greece and Turkey), Russo-Japanese (Russia and Japan), Sino-Cambodian (China and Cambodian), Americo-Liberian (the United States and the African nation of Liberia). In theory, at least, word forms exist to describe every conceivable pairing, although some (Peruvo-Ugandan? Papuo-Icelandic?) may tend more to the fabulous than the actually useful forms. Note that it could be argued that Franco-English, Italo-French, Turco-Grecian, and so forth are equally valid ways of describing the relationship or interactions. The term Afro-American was formerly used to describe a Black American, but now it is deemed more politically correct not to use the Afro- combining form and instead, the term African American is used.\n\nIn East Asia, a similar role to Latin and Greek has been played by Chinese, with non-Chinese languages both borrowing a significant number of words from Chinese and using morphemes borrowed from Chinese to coin new words, particularly in formal or technical language. See Sino-Japanese vocabulary, Sino-Korean vocabulary, and Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary for discussion.\n\nThe coinage of new native terms on Chinese roots is most notable in Japanese, where it is referred to as . Many of these have been subsequently borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, with the same (or corresponding) characters being pronounced differently according to language, just as happens in European languages – compare English \"biology\" and French \"biologie.\"\n\nFor example, 自動車 (Japanese \"jidōsha,\" Korean \"jadongcha\") is a Japanese-coined word meaning “automobile”, literally self-move-car; compare to \"auto\" (self) + \"mobile\" (moving).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among the prominent Methodists associated with the Kingsway Hall was Donald Soper, who was Superintendent Minister at the West London Mission from 1936 until his retirement in 1978.\n\nKingsway Hall took its name from the street on to which its main entrance opened. The address was West London Mission, 75 Kingsway, London .\n\nIn 1899, the London County Council (LCC) was given the power to proceed with major slum clearance in the area between Holborn and the Strand. The Methodist Church had operated its West London Mission since 1887 occupying a number of rented buildings in Piccadilly, St James' Hall and Princes Hall, and the Strand, Exeter Hall. These venues were steadily reclaimed as sites for new hotels so eventually in 1906 the church found a more permanent home for the Mission at 67 Great Queen Street where there was a chapel. There had been a chapel there since at least 1709 but the Methodists moved in in 1789 and from time to time refurbished and expanded it. In April 1907 this chapel was renamed as Kingsway Hall but the building was condemned by the LCC as part of the clearance. It was then decided to join the development taking place on the new Kingsway road and build a new Mission including a spacious chapel. An idea of the nature of the area around Great Queen Street and Holborn just before the new Kingsway was built can be found in the book \"Old time Aldwych, the Kingsway and Neighbourhood\" by Charles Gordon, published in 1903 by T Fisher Unwin.\n\nA new seven-story building called Wesley House was home to the West London Mission from 1911 until 1972, when it merged with the Hinde Street Methodist Chapel (a merger not completed until 1982). Wesley House included a youth club, religious meeting rooms, a luncheon club, mission offices, and accommodation for resident staff. Adjacent to Wesley House, and with a frontage on to Kingsway, the Church also speculated by building the International Buildings, which was let to many tenants and was a source of much needed revenue to run the mission. The mission was inaugurated at Wesley House on 6 December 1911, but Kingsway Hall, the chapel attached to Wesley House, required another year of construction. Although Kingsway Hall itself has been demolished, Wesley House remains today, no longer a mission, as do the International Buildings.\n\nFoundation stones for Kingsway Hall were laid 24 April 1912 and the hall was completed with a ceremony on 6 December 1912. The hall included a raked floor with over 2,000 seats.\n\nThe organ, built in 1912 by J. J. Binns of Leeds, was inaugurated 4 April 1913 with half its cost of £1,500 being contributed by American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. A fourth manual was added in 1924 by Messrs. Hill & Son and Norman & Beard, along with chimes and timpani. Gatty Sellars, the hall's organist at the time, gave the inaugural performance on the new organ. The organ was rebuilt in 1932 and remained in use until the closure of the hall. The Nigerian composer Fela Sowande was the organist of the hall from 1945. As soon as electrical recording began in the Hall among the very first recordings were those of the solo organ; some of these have been issued on CD by Amphion Records of Malton in Yorkshire.\n\nDonald Soper (the well-known pacifist, later to become Baron Soper), became the Methodist minister of Kingsway Hall in 1936. When German air raids on London started in 1940, Soper opened a \"rest and feeding centre\" in Kingsway Hall's basement (not far from Holborn underground station). Here the victims of the bombing could find refuge, and Soper and his family also lived there for a time. Until the end of 1944, Kingsway Hall ran a breakfast canteen. In one 6-month period alone, 26,232 breakfasts were served (and 34,178 cups of tea). At the request of the Ministry of Food, from 1942 Soper also organised the distribution of surplus vegetables from Covent Garden Market to the needy.\n\nThe Hall was used for public meetings as well as church services etc. One such meeting was held by the Free French on 18 June 1940 at which General Charles De Gaulle addressed them to encourage resistance to the very recent German invasion. On this same day Winston Churchill addressed the House of Commons giving his famous \"Finest Hour\" speech in which he refers to the recently lost Battle of France and the forthcoming Battle of Britain. The speech was recorded at Abbey Road studios.\n\nAfter the war, Kingsway Hall became an active venue for concerts and recording sessions, and was regarded as one of the best recording locations in the world. Its use for concerts and recordings continued until 1983 when it was acquired by the GLC and closed.\n\nAt the end of March 1983 the Greater London Council purchased Wesley House and Kingsway Hall for the women's committee. Kingsway Hall was rapidly deteriorating, and an archaeological survey in August 1996 found that nothing significant about it was still present. Despite pleas from some musicians and record magazines, Kingsway was demolished in 1998 to make way for a hotel of the same name, which opened in 2000. The hotel's reception desk is on the approximate location where orchestra members once recorded.\n\nKingsway was built for evangelistic purposes, as a place of worship, not as a concert or recording hall. However, it was considered to have the finest acoustics in London for recording orchestral and choral repertory. The acoustics resulted more by accident than through conscious design. The size and shape of the space as well as the plastered walls and wooden floor all contributed, as did the large storage chamber below the hall. Musicians were enthusiastic about performing there since the hall allowed them to hear their own playing very well. At the same time they found other aspects of the hall difficult since nearby parking was scarce, it was cold in the winter, was dingy and dirty, and lacked food services. For recording engineers, there was also continual rumbling from the London Underground line interrupting recordings. Directly below Great Queen Street is the main line of the Underground Piccadilly line which opened on 15 December 1906, and under Kingsway was a branch, the rail extension from Holborn to Aldwych which opened 13 November 1907 and closed 1994. The sound of the underground could be heard on many recordings, and became known as the \"Kingsway rumble\". There were also recording problems created by road and construction noise, and even occasional interruptions from the clientele of the mission itself. Engineers complained that takes made with outside traffic noise could not be edited together with those made while traffic stopped for a red light.\n\nDespite the drawbacks, Kingsway became the most sought-after recording venue for orchestral music in England because of its central location and excellent acoustics, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, when companies were converting from monaural to stereophonic recordings. The London Symphony Orchestra alone made 421 recordings there between 1926 and 1983; the London Philharmonic Orchestra made 280 recordings there, including its very first sessions (with Malcolm Sargent conducting choral favorites).\n\nThe hall had sufficient space for choral and even operatic recordings, and the availability of the organ offered still another benefit. Since the stage itself was not large enough for an orchestra or chorus, the metal ground floor seating was removed for recordings. The conductor often faced the horseshoe balcony, giving that individual an unusual prospect of looking at the orchestra rising rapidly away from him due to the five percent raked floor that sloped down towards him and the stage behind. Cellists much preferred to have the seating this way around so that they played \"downhill\" rather than up.\n\nHis Master's Voice began recording at Kingsway Hall on 3 November 1925 using electrical equipment obtained from the American Western Electric company, to whom they paid a royalty on each disc sold for the patents involved, and continued making regular use of it even after the construction of its own recording complex at Abbey Road Studios in 1931. From about 1933 EMI used its own equipment designed by their brilliant engineer Alan Blumlein, who successfully circumvented the Western Electric patents and thus avoided their substantial royalty costs. At this time he also developed and patented a stereo disc recording method which was eventually adopted for the LP standard set in 1958. Decca Records only began using the hall in May 1944, introducing their famous FFRR recording system developed during war work, but it would become one of the three most-used Decca recording locations (the others being Victoria Hall in Geneva, and the Sofiensaal in Vienna). Lyrita used Kingsway from 1965 to 1980 (these recordings were actually produced by Decca's recording team) as did RCA Records from 1957 to 1977. Although primarily used for classical music recording, very occasionally dance bands and the like were recorded there including Sydney Lipton in the thirties and Ted Heath in the summer of 1958 and again in 1963. Mantovani made a number of recordings at Kingsway including a carol concert album in 1953 and a Kismet album for Decca's Phase Four label released in 1964. EMI rarely used the venue for chamber music but Decca recorded solo keyboard, violin sonatas and string quartets.\n\nEMI and Decca had opportunities to purchase Kingsway Hall, which they did not pursue. EMI determined that although the facility was one of the best recording locations in the world, refurbishment would be too expensive. Decca's and EMI's recording contracts at Kingsway expired 31 December 1983. The final recording, with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli, was made with Deutsche Grammophon a few days later: Giacomo Puccini's \"Manon Lescaut\", which finished taping on 5 January 1984.\n\nAt 3.30 in the afternoon of Friday, 6 December 1912, the Lord Mayor of London, Colonel Sir David Burnett, presided over the opening ceremony of a new Methodist Church Hall. Although this was an event that took place in Central London, the opening was reported in the national press including the \"Manchester Guardian\", the \"Times\", \"Express\", \"Morning Post\" and \"Daily News and Leader\". \"The Daily Graphic\" of 5 December, as well as several provincial newspapers, published photographs of the new Hall. That Church Hall was of course Kingsway Hall, well known to record collectors world wide for the qualities of its acoustic, and it was built to replace a previous Kingsway Hall based in a chapel round the corner at 67 Great Queen Street. A chapel had existed at the site since at least 1709.\n\nHowever, regular recording did not begin in the Hall until January 1926, a year of economic depression and the General Strike, when HMV signed an exclusive contract with the Church authorities. That 1-year agreement, the first of many, allowed for 130 sessions for a fee of £1,000. At this time HMV also had exclusive recording access to the Queen's and Albert Halls. The reason for this initiative was of course the coming to maturity of electrical recording technology that allowed recordings to be made in the natural acoustics of the concert hall, free of the constraints of acoustic recording and its intrusive sound gathering horns. At first, the new technology allowed the disc recording machines to be located in other buildings in London [Queen's Hall and other HMV premises] the microphones being connected to them using Post Office telephone lines. Soon however disc-cutting machines were installed in the Hall itself using rooms beneath the stage. In the years between 1912 and 1926, including those of the Great War, the Hall was also used for concerts conducted by the likes of Beecham and Boult with the young John Barbirolli among the cellists, its fine acoustic having been discovered early in its life. The Hall's active life spanned the age of the acoustic cylinder to the coming of the Compact Disc. It remained a venue for public meetings and exhibitions, for example, a model railway engineering exhibition in 1928.\n\nThe Hall itself was only part of the complex of buildings that the church had built to re-house its evangelical West London Mission, which was launched in October 1887; its partner was Wesley Hall, where the philanthropic work of the Mission was carried out. Whilst the element of the Mission that was Kingsway Hall was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for the present Kingsway Hall Hotel in Great Queen Street, Wesley Hall still stands but is now used mainly for office accommodation with an entrance in a side street. The main entrance to Kingsway Hall in Kingsway itself is now a sandwich bar. The centenary of the WLM was celebrated at the Methodist Hinde Street premises in 1997 and the artifacts and documents of the exhibition are held at the London Metropolitan Archive. Some items are also held in the Local Studies section of the Holborn branch of the Camden library in the Theobalds Road.\n\nDuring the 1930s the Great Western Railway built a series of steam locomotives in its Hall class. Number 5933 was built in June 1933 and was called Kingsway Hall. Its first home was Bristol, before being moved to Reading, Southall and finally Oxford, from where it was withdrawn from service in 1965 and scrapped at Llanelli.\n\nWhilst the opening of Abbey Road studios in November 1931 reduced the need for Kingsway as a regular venue, HMV, now a part of the newly formed EMI, retained it under exclusive contract but available to all other EMI partner labels, including Columbia. EMI were to retain this guarded access to a prized acoustic until the Hall was acquired by the Greater London Council in 1983, after which all recording activity ceased, the final contract expiring on 31 December that year. Exclusivity was maintained throughout the whole time between 1926 and 1983 and shared between EMI, and all its affiliated labels, and Decca, and its affiliates, who joined the agreement in 1944. Whilst both EMI and Decca used the Hall for sessions sponsored by other labels such as Lyrita, the recording teams were always those of EMI or Decca. However, occasionally, when they were not using the Hall themselves, Decca and EMI agreed to allow access to small labels using their own equipment and technicians, even loaning microphones on occasion. Such was the rare case with a label, Bartok Records established by Peter Bartok, the composer's son, who made a number of recordings of his father's works in 1950 [or 1951, the dates are not verified] and again in 1953. The New Symphony Orchestra was used, a pick up band organised by Jack Simmons, and for some items it was conducted by Walter Susskind. These rare recordings are available on CD [www.bartokrecords.com].\n\nThe very last recordings made at Kingsway were by Deutsche Grammophon, a partner of Philips and Decca in Phonogram since 1979, of \"Manon Lescaut\", Sinopoli conducting the Philharmonia, recorded between 28 December 1983 and 5 January 1984. Of all the orchestras to have recorded at Kingsway, the Philharmonia/New Philharmonia spent more days there than any other. Decca's last recording was Beethoven's String Quartet Opus 130 and Große Fuge, Op. 133, with the Fitzwilliam Quartet on 10–12 December 1983. EMI's last recording appears to have been Tennstedt's Mahler 6 with the LPO in May 1983.\n\nWhilst the vast majority of recordings at Kingsway were of London or British orchestras [e.g. the Halle under Barbirolli, City of Birmingham under Fremaux], very rare visitors to Kingsway for recording included the Vienna Philharmonic. The VPO appeared once only on 4 October 1949 for a recording of Mahler's \"Kindertotenlieder\" with Walter and Ferrier [also a centenary year of hers this year] for Columbia. This recording was made after a performance in London and after some contractual wrangling between Decca [who owned Ferrier's contract] on the one hand and EMI/HMV [who owned that of the VPO] and EMI/Columbia [who owned Walter's] on the other. It is available on Naxos Historical 8.110 876 as well as REGIS RRC1153 and EMI 678 722 2. In the aftermath of WW2, Decca needed artists and so invited a number of continental orchestras to record in London, usually while they were on tour. Among these were the Turin Symphony Orchestra under Frede and Rossi, the Paris Conservatoire under Charles Munch [both in 1947] and the Hamburg Radio Symphony Orchestra under Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. Later the Israel Philharmonic under Mehta also recorded whilst passing through London on tour in both 1968 [Dvorak and Tchaikovsky] and 1975 [Bartok]. James Galway recorded with the Zagreb Soloists for RCA in 1975. Infrequent visiting conductors were Krauss, Celibidache, Kleiber Snr, Furtwangler, Knapperstsbusch, Weingartner, Szell, Dorati, Leinsdorf, Bohm, etc.\n\nAlthough Kingsway Hall is no more, its legacy of many great recordings made over 57 years covers every genre of classical music from organ music, string quartets, solo piano, opera and choral works and film scores to full-scale orchestral symphonies. These recordings can be explored by browsing the several discographies compiled by Philip Stuart for a number of London Orchestras [LPO, LSO, ASMF and ECO] and by Stephen Pettit for the Philharmonia [up to only 1987]. It even included Christmas carol recordings by the oddly named Butlin Choral Society. It was also very rarely a location for recorded jazz concerts [Ted Heath 1958 and 1963] and even Mantovani. Its acoustic added something unique to all these genres.\n\nIts demise was brought about by a combination of events but also by factors which related to its location and the fate of the recording industry. Rumbles from the Piccadilly line plagued its whole life, as did extraneous noise from traffic and aircraft, neighbouring buildings and from the inhabitants of the Wesley Hall Mission next door. There were always complaints about the maintenance of the building, especially when it was owned by the church, whose funds were much diminished after WW2. Indeed the roof collapsed in early September 1969 and put the Hall out of action whilst repairs were made, and imminent sessions for the ASMF Vivaldi Four Seasons were hastily moved to St John's Smith Square. The Church sold the whole Mission building to British Land in 1972, but this did not improve matters. After a number of attempts at justifying acquiring it, neither Decca nor EMI could envisage the building being a major recording centre, and so in 1983 it fell into the hands of the GLC, bringing its recording career to an end.\n\nIn March 1986 the GLC was abolished and the Hall put up for sale once again. In October 1987 a centenary exhibition was held at the Mission's then home at Hinde Street, near Wigmore Hall and a history published, authored by Professor Philip Bagwell. Many of the exhibits and artifacts are now kept at the London Metropolitan Archives in London. By this time Kingsway Hall had been out of regular use for some time and was in a poor state of repair. It would seem that there were no takers, and so it was gutted and remained derelict until 1996, when planning permission for its demolition and replacement by a hotel was requested. The Gramophone magazine and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe were among the very few to object, and archeological excavations were conducted by the Museum of London, following which no widespread opposition was raised to the granting of the demolition order, English Heritage being unable to justify preservation. Kingsway Hall was demolished in 1998 and the hotel opened in 2000. Fate seemed to dog the Mission's home; its previous two meeting Halls, St James' in Piccadilly and Exeter Hall in the Strand, had also been demolished to make way for hotels. One Hall that was used by the WLM whilst Kingsway Hall was being built was the \"new\" St James, or Philharmonic, Hall in Great Portland Street. The building survives today but now as a BBC Office block called Brock House.\n\n Both recordings have been issued on CD\n\n"}

Abbas is buried in the Shrine of Abbas in Karbala, Karbala Governorate, Iraq, where he was martyred during the Battle of Karbala on the day of Ashura. He was praised for his \"handsome looks\" and was also well known in the Arab community for his courage, bravery, strength and ferocity as a warrior. Ibn Manzur narrates in his al-Ayn that Al-Abbas was the \"lion that other lions feared\" as a testament to his accolades as a warrior. Sheikh at-Turaihi describes Abbas's appearance as resembling an unshakable mountain, with his heart firmly rooted, due to his qualities as a \"unique horseman\" and a \"fearless hero\".\n\nAbbas was born in the month of Sha'ban in the year 26 AH (approximately May 647 CE) in the city of Medina to Ali and Umm al Banin. Abbas had three full brothers – Abdullah ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib, Jafar ibn Ali, and Usman ibn Ali. Abbas married a distant cousin, Lubaba. They had three sons – Fadl ibn Abbas, Mohammad ibn Abbas, and Ubaydullah ibn Abbas. His mother would recite famous lines of poetry in supplication to ward off the evil of those who envied him.\n\nAbbas debuted as a soldier in the Battle of Siffin, one of the main conflicts of the struggle between Abbas's father Ali and Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, in 657 CE. Wearing the clothes of his father, who was known to be a great warrior, Abbas killed many enemy soldiers. Muawiya's forces actually mistook him for Ali. Therefore, when Ali himself appeared on the battlefield, Muawiya's soldiers were astonished to see him and confused about the identity of the other soldier. Ali then introduced Abbas by saying:\n\nHe is Abbas, the moon of the Hashimites.\n\nAbbas was trained by his father and his elder brother Hassan in the art of battle, which may be one reason he resembled his father on the battlefield. When describing his fighting on the battlefield, many historians call him a furious lion because of his courage, fearlessness, and strength as an attacker.Abbas then became the trainer of most of his elder brothers sons in the art of battlefield. A perfect example of this is the courage of Ali Akbar son of Hussain\n\nAbbas showed his loyalty to Hussein at the Battle of Karbala. After succeeding his father Muawiya I as caliph, Yazid I demanded that Hussein pledge allegiance to him, but Hussein refused, saying:\n\nYazid is a person who kills people without cause, and an individual like me doesn't pledge allegiance to someone like him...\n\nAs these behaviors were (and still are) prohibited in Islam, if Hussein had pledged allegiance to Yazid, his act would have ruined the basics of Islam. Hussein's elder brother Hassan had made a pact, that they (i.e. Ahl al-Bayt) would be responsible for religious (i.e., Islamic) decisions and would not interfere in other matters. Hussein wanted to do what had been agreed upon, but Yazid I wanted to take total control of diverse affairs. With the help of Ubayd Allah, Yazid I conspired to kill Hussein by sending a letter to him in the name of people of Kufa (Iraq), inviting him to come to Kufa and guide them on the right path, an invitation that was accepted by Hussein; though most historians state that the letters were actually sent by the people of Kufa who later betrayed him when the body of Muslim ibn Aqeel (Hussein's messenger to Kufa) was thrown from a building in the center of Kufa by Yazid's army while the people of Kufa stood silent. In 60 AH (680 AD), Hussein left Medina for Mecca with a small group of companions and family members to travel to Kufa. He sent his cousin, Muslim, on ahead to make his decision after the advice of his cousin. But, by the time Hussein arrived near Kufa, his cousin had been killed.\n\nOn the way of Kufa, Hussein and his group were intercepted. They were forced into a detour and arrived in Karbala on the 2nd of Muharram, 61 AH. Hussein's camp was surrounded and cut off from the Euphrates river. The camp ran out of water on the 7th of Muharram.\n\nApart of being the \"standard bearer\" of Hussain ibn Ali's army, Abbas was asked by Hussain to provide some water for the thirsty children. The Euphrates river was occupied by Yazid I's army to prevent the camp of Hussain from getting water. Because of his skill and bravery, Abbas could have attacked Yazid I's army, occupied the river, and retrieved water for the camp alone. However, Abbas was only allowed to be defensive because his brother Hussain didn't want him to fight. He was only allowed to get water (although there are also narrations which mention that he participated in battle, too). Eventually, Abbas went to the river to get water for the children in Hussein's camp. Sakinah was very attached to Abbas, who was her uncle. To her, Abbas was their only hope for getting water. Abbas could not stand to see her thirsty and crying, \"Thy thirst!\". When Abbas entered the battlefield, he only had a spear, and a bag for water in his hands. He was also given the authority to hold the standard in the battle and Hussain gave the standard to him who was the bravest one; therefore he came to be known as Abbas Alamdar. Once he had made it to the river, he started filling the bag with water. Abbas's loyalty to Hussein was so great that, although he was very thirsty, Abbas drank no water because he could not bear the thought that Sakinah was thirsty. This story illustrates how Abbas conquered the Euphrates river, held it with his mighty hands, yet still did not drink. After gathering the water, Abbas rode back towards the camp. On his way back, he was struck from behind, and one of his arms was amputated. Then he was struck from behind again; the attack amputated his other arm. Abbas continued, carrying the water-bag in his mouth. Yazid's soldiers started shooting arrows at him. One arrow hit the bag, and water poured out of it. Immediately after the bag of water was hit, the enemy shot an arrow at Abbas that hit his eye. One of Yazid's men hit Abbas' head with a mace, and, lacking the support of his arms, Abbas fell off his horse. As he was falling, he called, \"Oh brother!\", [calling for Hussein]. Abbas fell on his face before he let the standard fall.\n\nHe was martyred on Friday, the 10th of Muharram, 61 AH, near the bank of the river Euphrates. Hence, he is called the \"Hero of the Euphrates.\" His death is generally commemorated by the Shiite Muslims on the eighth night of Muharram. Muslims, particularly Shiites, mourn the death of all the martyrs who fell at the Battle of Karbala with Hussein in the Islamic month of Muharram, mainly in the first ten days of the month. Fadl ibn Abbas and Qasim ibn Abbas also laid down their lives in Karbala. Ubaydullah ibn Abbas lived to continue the lineage of Abbas with five sons of his own.\n\nAbbas was buried at the spot where he fell from his horse in Karbala, Iraq. The Shrine of Abbas was built around his grave, at which millions of pilgrims pay homage every year. The Albanian Bektashi community also maintain a shrine to Abbas on the summit of Mount Tomorr, where an annual pilgrimage is held every August.\n\nAbbas ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib had 5 sons, namely: Ubaidullah, Fadhl, Hassan, Qasim and Mohammad; and also 2 daughters. Ibn Shahrashub, the prominent historian, recorded that: \"Muhammad ibn Abbas was martyred in Karbala with his father.\" The mother of Ubaidullah and Fadhl was Lubaba. Genealogists have agreed unanimously that the progeny of Al-Abbas came from his son Ubaidullah. Sheikh al-Futouni, however, mentioned that Hassan ibn Abbas also had sons and descendants. Ubaidullah ibn Abbas, who died in 155 AH, was a celebrated scholar known for his handsomeness, perfect morality, and fine personality. He had three wives.\n\nAli (son of Hussein), had great respect for his uncle Abbas. He often wept when his eyes fell on Ubaidullah, explaining that he reminded him of his father's heroic and tragic exploit on that day in Karbala.\n\nAl-Hassan, son of Ubaidullah, lived to age 67 and had five sons – Fadhl, Hamza, Ibrahim, Abbas, and Ubaidullah, all of whom became honorable, virtuous authors.\n\nAl-Fadhl was such an eloquent, religious, and courageous personality that even caliphs respected him. He was named 'Ibn al-Hashimiyya – son of the Hashemite woman . He had three sons – Ja'far, al-Abbas al-Akbar, and Mohammad.\n\nHamza ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah was another descendant of Abbas ibn Ali, and was like \"Ali ibn Abu Talib\" who was his ancestor. A Pakistani tribe namely Awan are descendants of Qutb Shah who is a direct descendant of Hamza ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah. Awans are descendants of Qutb Shah (Aawn) ibn Yaala ibn Hamza ibn Qasim ibn Tayyar ibn Qasim ibn Ali ibn Jaffar ibn Humza ibn al-Hassan ibn Ubaidullah ibn Abbas ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib.\nAbu'l-Abbas al-Fadhl ibn Mohammed ibn al-Fadhl ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah ibn al-Abbas who was a famous orator/poet, composed several poetic verses eulogizing his ancestor, Abbas ibn Ali.\n\nIbrahim Jardaqa (Arabic: ابراهیم جردقة) was another descendant of Abbas ibn Ali. Jardaqa was a jurist and litterateur; he was well known for his ascetics (piety), too. Abdullah ibn Ali ibn Ibrahim (Arabic: عبدالله بن علي بن ابراهیم) wrote several books, consisting one titled al-Ja'fariyya. He died in Egypt in AH 312. Al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah ibn al-Abbas was a well-known celebrity among the Hashemites; he visited Baghdad at the time of Harun ar-Rashid reign. He was also among the most celebrated poets.\n\nAbu't-Tayyib Mohammad ibn Hamza (Arabic: ابوطیب محمد بن حمزه) was also one of Abbas descendants who had a good personality. He was likewise well known for his regard for his relatives and likewise his virtue. Abu-Tayyib had properties in Jordan where he was killed in 291 AH . His descendants were called \"sons of the martyr\". Abdullah ibn al-Abbas, another son of Abbas ibn Ali whose name has been mentioned among the \"martyrs of Karbala\", He was famous for his virtue/celebrity, too. The Abbasid caliph al-Ma'moun mentioned about him that: \"All people are the same after your departure, son of al-Abbas!\".\n\nUbaidullah ibn al-Hasan whose ancestor is reached to Abbas, was the governor/qadi of Mecca and Medina during the reign of al-Ma'moun. Abu-Ya'la al-Hamza ibn al-Qasim ibn Ali ibn Hamza ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah ibn al-Abbas ibn Ali, as another descendant of Abbas was one of the most celebrated men of knowledge. He was great hadithist who instructed many famed scholars and wrote many books, such as \"Kitab ut-Tawhid\", \"Kitab uz-Ziyaraatu wel-Menasik\", and many others in different fields of knowledge, particularly in Ilm ur-Rijal and Ilm ul-Hadith. Many scholars described him with remarkable words of praise. In a village called al-Hamza in al-Jazira, central Iraq, between the Euphrates and the Tigris, 102 is a handsome shrine built over the tomb of al-Hamza that continues to be visited by many people.\n\nAbbas is known as Abu al-Fazl (ابوالفضل), meaning the father of heavenly graces and/or the father of the graceful manner. Abbas was the king of chivalry and the most loyal companion to his half brother Hussain. Abbas ibn Ali is also known as-Qamar Banu Hashim, meaning the moon of the Hashim clan.\n\nHe is also known as Ghazi; Ghazi (غازی), meaning \"soldier who returns successfully from the battle\". Although Abbas was killed at Karbala, he is known as because, when he carried out the first strike against Yazid's army, his mission was to rescue the horse which was seized by Shimr during the battle of Siffin. This horse belonged to his other brother Hasan ibn Ali. Abbas retained control over the horse and presented it to Husayn.\n\nAbbas was given a horse named \"Uqab\" (Eagle). Shia sources say that this horse was used by Muhammad and Ali and that this horse was presented to Muhammad by the King of Yemen, Saif ibn Zee Yazni, through Abd al-Muttalib. The king considered the horse to be very important, and its superiority over other horses was evident by the fact that its genealogical tree was also maintained. It was initially named \"Murtajiz\", which comes from the Arabic name \"Rijiz\" meaning thunder (lightning).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051587", "title": "Grid (graphic design)", "text": "Grid (graphic design)\n\nIn graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal, and angular) or curved lines (grid lines) used to structure content. The grid serves as an armature or framework on which a designer can organize graphic elements (images, glyphs, paragraphs, etc.) in a rational, easy-to-absorb manner. A grid can be used to organize graphic elements in relation to a page, in relation to other graphic elements on the page, or relation to other parts of the same graphic element or shape.\n\nThe less-common printing term \"reference grid,\" is an unrelated system with roots in the early days of printing.\n\nBefore the invention of movable type a system based on optimal proportions had been used to arrange handwritten text on pages. One such system, known as the Villard Diagram, was in use at least since medieval times.\n\nAfter World War II, a number of graphic designers, including Max Bill, Emil Ruder, and Josef Müller-Brockmann, influenced by the modernist ideas of Jan Tschichold's \"Die neue Typographie\" (The New Typography), began to question the relevance of the conventional page layout of the time. They began to devise a flexible system able to help designers achieve coherency in organizing the page. The result was the modern typographic grid that became associated with the International Typographic Style. The seminal work on the subject, \"Grid systems in graphic design\" by Müller-Brockmann, helped propagate the use of the grid, first in Europe, and later in North America.\n\nBy the mid-1970s instruction of the typographic grid as a part of graphic design curricula had become standard in Europe, North America and much of Latin America. The graphic style of the grid was adopted as a look for corporate communication. In the early 1980s, a reaction against the entrenchment of the grid, particularly its dogmatic use, and association with corporate culture, resulted in some designers rejecting its use in favor of more organic structure. The appearance of the Apple Macintosh computer, and the resulting transition away from type being set by typographers to designers setting type themselves resulted in a wave of experimentation, much of it contrary to the precepts of Tschichold and Müller-Brockmann. The typographic grid continues to be taught today, but more as a useful tool for some projects, not as a requirement or starting point for all page design.\n\nWhile grid systems have seen significant use in print media, interest from web developers has only recently seen a resurgence. Website design frameworks producing HTML and CSS had existed for a while before newer frameworks popularised the use of grid-based layouts. Some grid systems specify fixed-width elements with pixels, and some are 'fluid', meaning that they call for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.\n\nThe W3C published the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 to define a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.\n\nThere are also CSS frameworks that include their own grid system:\n\nMost desktop publishing software and professional publishing software and other office software including word processors displays grid layout as an option.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051591", "title": "Matthew 4:9", "text": "Matthew 4:9\n\nMatthew 4:9 is the ninth verse of the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. It is part of the Temptation of Christ narrative. Jesus has rebuffed two earlier temptations by Satan. The devil has thus transported Jesus to the top of a great mountain and shown him all the kingdoms of the world. In this verse Satan offers control of the world to Jesus if he agrees to worship him.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:9\n\nAs is hinted in the previous verse and confirmed at and this verse seems to show that the devil controlled the world before the coming of Jesus. It also is said to show how unimportant the physical world is, Satan is willing to abandon it to Jesus in exchange for Jesus not threatening him in the spiritual world. Jesus seems to agree that the physical world is secondary and that he is also mainly interested in the spiritual one. This scene has thus been used as an argument for the supremacy of spiritual over secular power. In a famous letter, Pope Gregory VII used this section to assert his precedence over the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThis temptation is somewhat different from the previous two. In both of those Satan began with \"if you are the messiah\" and asked Jesus to test his powers. In this verse Jesus' messianic status is confirmed and rather than test his role of Son of God Jesus is asked to confirm it. The previous two verses have Satan more in his early Old Testament role of what Albright and Mann refer to as the \"opposing council,\" one who works for God by testing the faithful. In this verse he presents himself as the more modern adversary of God.\n\nAs with the previous temptations there are various theories as to its meaning. The traditional view that developed in the Middle Ages was that the devil was simply testing Jesus with the sin of avarice. Most modern scholars reject this sin based interpretation. A second theory that was popular for some time, and is still held by many, is that the temptation narrative represents Jesus rejecting alternate views of the messiah. In this verse Satan is tempting Jesus to become a political figure rather than a spiritual one. Many Jews expected the messiah would be both a spiritual and political liberator who would lead the Jewish people to freedom from the Romans and dominion over the world. Why Jesus did not do so was an important discussion in the early church. This temptation is thus theorized as a demonstration that Jesus seeking political power would have been following the will of Satan. A third theory that is popular today is to see the temptation narrative as one of Jesus not making the same mistakes as the Israelites did. France notes that many times since the Exodus the Israelites had compromised their principles for political goals and in this verse Jesus makes clear he will not do the same. Schweizer proposes that the temptation might include elements of both the later two interpretations. As with the rest of the temptation narrative this section is believed to have been taken from Q. Schweizer notes that at the time Q was written the central political issue in the region would have been the Great Jewish Revolt. The small Christian community did not join the Zealots in the revolt and Schweizer feels that Q thus focused on justifying this decision by focusing on the unimportance of politics compared to the spiritual. By the time the Gospel of Matthew was written the Revolt had faded from prominence, Matthew thus adapted the section to fit more closely with his theme of Jesus as the culmination of Jewish history, but preserved some elements of the original argument in Q.\n"}
{"id": "2051594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051594", "title": "The Hourglass Sanatorium", "text": "The Hourglass Sanatorium\n\nThe Hourglass Sanatorium () is a 1973 Polish film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has, starring Jan Nowicki, Tadeusz Kondrat, Mieczysław Voit, Halina Kowalska and Gustaw Holoubek. It is also known as The Sandglass in English-speaking countries. The story follows a young Jewish man who visits his father in a mystical sanatorium where time does not behave normally. The film is an adaptation of Bruno Schulz's story collection \"Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass\". It won the Jury Prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nJoseph (Jan Nowicki) travels through a dream-like world, taking a dilapidated train to visit his dying father, Jacob, in a sanatorium. When he arrives at the hospital, he finds the entire facility is going to ruin and no one seems to be in charge or even caring for the patients. Time appears to behave in unpredictable ways, reanimating the past in an elaborate artificial caprice.\n\nThough Joseph is always shown as an adult, his behavior and the people around often depict him as a child. He befriends Rudolf, a young boy who owns a postage stamp album. The names of the stamps trigger a wealth of association and adventure in Joseph. Among the many occurrences in this visually potent phantasmagoria include Joseph re-entering childhood episodes with his wildly eccentric father (who lives with birds in an attic), being arrested by a mysterious unit of soldiers for having a dream that was severely criticized in high places, reflecting on a girl he fantasized about in his boyhood and commandeering a group of historic wax mannequins. Throughout his strange journey, an ominous blind train conductor reappears like a death figure.\n\nHas also adds a series of reflections on the Holocaust that were not present in the original texts, reading Schulz's prose through the prism of the author's death during World War II and the demise of the world he described.\n\n\n\"The Hourglass Sanatorium\" is not solely an adaptation of \"Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass\", but also includes sequences from other works by Bruno Schulz. Regarding the possibility of a film adaptation of a book written by Schulz, director Wojciech Jerzy Has said: \"Schulz's poetic prose was the reading of my early youth. It influenced my films. That is why the realization of \"The Hourglass Sanatorium\" was a must for me. My aim was not to make a literal adaption of the work, but rather to do justice to what we call the work's poetics: its unique, isolated world, its atmospherics, colours and shapes.\" The time period of the film is a mixture of elements from the turn-of-the-century Galicia where Schulz grew up, and Has' own pre-World War II memories of the same region. The film was produced by Zespół Filmowy Silesia. Principal photography took place at the Wytwórnia Filmów Fabularnych studios in Łódź.\n\nDespite being a major production, the finished film was met by reluctance from the Polish authorities. Not only was the crumbled sanatorium interpreted as a parallel to the poor condition of many institutions and manor houses in contemporary Poland; Has had also chosen to emphasize the Jewish aspects of the source material, and this soon after an antisemitic campaign the government had launched in 1968, which had prompted around 30,000 Polish Jews to leave the country. The authorities forbid Has to submit \"The Hourglass Sanatorium\" for the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, but the director managed to smuggle a print abroad so the film could be screened at the festival. The Cannes jury, led by actress Ingrid Bergman, honoured the film with the Jury Prize. The Polish premiere took place on 11 December 1973. The film is among 21 digitally restored classic Polish films chosen for \"Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.\" and has been released on blu-ray in a related box set by Milestone Cinema.\n\nWhen the film was released in Poland it met with mixed reviews from the critics and it was mostly criticized by literary scholars. Artur Sandauer noted that the book was a great material for a film, however, he strongly rejected Has's adaptation since in his opinion it changed Schulz's story \"of cosmic dimensions\" into \"grotesque folklore\". Jerzy Jastrzębski opined that Has's film evokes \"a feeling of clear insufficiency\". The film was positively reviewed by Konrad Eberhard and Adam Garbicz who claimed that it wasn't the film director's intention to adapt Schulz's prose in a literal manner but rather to capture its eschatological climate.\n\nIn France, the film was very positively received with film critics such as François Mourin, writing for \"L'Humanité\", praising it for the costumes, set design and decorations, cinematography as well as the actors' performance. Jacques Siclier writing for \"Le Monde\" stated that the viewer watching the film experiences \"an emotional and breathtaking shock\". Richard Bégin described the film's \"permeable atmosphere of transcience and deadness\" generated by the dominant shots of ruins.\n\nThe film also received recognition in Britain and the United States. Phelim O’Neill of \"The Guardian\" considered Has's film as \"another psychedelic classic\" while Michael Wilmington of \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 commenting on the splendid and surreal adaptation of Schulz's literary work.\n\nIn the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in Łódź, \"The Hourglass Sanatorium\" was ranked as the fifth greatest Polish film of all time.\n\n\nEssay on the film: A Journey into the Underworld \n\n"}

The municipal unit has an area of 167.575 km. Until 2011, it was a municipality whose seat was in Chiliomodi.\n\nThe modern city is named after ancient Tenea, established approximately 15 km SE of Corinth and 20 km NE of Mycenae shortly after the Trojan War. According to Pausanias, Tenea's founders were Trojan prisoners of war whom Agamemnon had allowed to build their own town. The name Tenea is styled upon Tenedos, the founders' home town, whose mythological eponym was the hero Tenes. Tenea and Rome, according to Virgil's Aeneid, had in the years following the Trojan War produced citizens of Trojan ancestry. Under the leadership of Archias in 734 or 733 BC, Teneans and Corinthians established the joint colony of Syracuse in Sicily, the homeland of Archimedes.\n\nStrabo mentions Tenea:\n\nas does Pausanias:\n\nTenea was the most important place in ancient Corinthia after the city of Corinth and its port towns; it was situated 60 stadia south of Corinth, according to Pausanias, hence the southern gate of Corinth was called the Teneatic. Stephanus of Byzantium describes Tenea as lying between Corinth and Mycenae. Pausanias says that the Teneatae claimed descent from the inhabitants of Tenedos, who were brought over from Troy as prisoners, and settled by Agamemnon in this part of Corinthia; and that it was in consequence of their Trojan origin that they worshipped Apollo above all the other gods. Strabo also mentions here the temple of Apollo Teneates, and says that Tenea and Tenedos had a common origin in Tennes, the son of Cycnus. It was at Tenea that Oedipus was said to have passed his childhood. It was also from this place that Archias took the greater number of the colonists with whom he founded Syracuse. After the destruction of Corinth by Lucius Mummius Achaicus, Tenea had the good fortune to continue undisturbed, because it is said to have assisted the Romans against Corinth. We cannot, however, suppose that an insignificant place like Tenea could have acted in opposition to Corinth and the Achaean League; and it is more probable that the Teneatae were spared by Mummius in consequence of their pretended Trojan descent and consequent affinity with the Romans themselves.\n\nRuins of ancient Tenea are one kilometre south of Chiliomodi. Some archaeological finds are housed in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth. The most famous find, the Kouros of Tenea (c. 550 BC), found near Athikia in 1846, is in the Munich Glyptothek. It is a great example of 6th century BC Greek sculpture and of the so-called Aeginetean or archaic smile.\n\nIn 1984, archaeologists discovered a sarcophagus of the Greek early archaic period containing the skeletal remains of what had been a high-society woman along with offerings.\n\nIn 2013, archaeologists surveyed a site in the area and, encouraged by pottery and other small finds, began excavating. They said that “The concentration of ceramics and architectural remains… were the reasons that led us to the excavation of the site,” In 2017, they found a trove of riches while digging up what had been a dual-chambered burial ground at the Tenea site. In 2018, they found “proof of the existence of the ancient city” of Tenea lead by Elena Korka near the village of Chiliomodi. An image of the excavation site depicts stone walls, clay and marble floors, about 200 rare coins, the remains of what were probably houses from the settlement. During the excavation, seven burials with vases and jewelry were revealed dating to the Roman and Hellenistic periods. Besides, skeletons of a woman and an infant were found. According to Elena Korka, Tenea’s cutting coins was the indicator of its complete independence. In 2019, a complex of massive baths, roughly , was discovered in Tenea, dating back to the Roman times between the end of 3rd to mid-1st century BC.\n\nThe municipal unit Tenea is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):\n\n\n"}

The title is widely used in North American for-profit organizations, though many United States nonprofits have adopted the title president or CEO.\n\nConfusion can arise because the words \"executive\" and \"director\" occur both in this title and in titles of various members of some organizations' boards of directors. \n\nThe role of the executive director is to design, develop and implement strategic plans for the organization in a manner that is both cost and time-efficient. The executive director is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of the organization, which includes managing committees and staff as well as developing business plans in collaboration with the board. In essence, the board grants the executive director the authority to run the organization. The executive director is accountable to the chairman of the board of directors and reports to the board on a regular basis – quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The board may offer suggestions and ideas about how to improve the organization, but the executive director decides whether or not, and how, to implement these ideas.\n\nThe executive director is a leadership role for an organization and often fulfills a motivational role in addition to office-based work. Executive directors motivate and mentor members, volunteers, and staff, and may chair meetings. The executive director leads the organization and develops its organizational culture.\n\nIn the UK, an executive director is a member of a board who is also an employee with a senior role. It is common for boards to have several executive directors, e.g. for different departments.\nThere is no legal difference between an executive and a non-executive director (NXD or NED), but there are considerable \ndifferences in the expectations associated with the role.\n\n"}

This plant has many common names, including common soapwort, bouncing-bet, crow soap, wild sweet William, and soapweed. There are about 20 species of soapworts altogether.\n\nThe scientific name \"Saponaria\" is derived from the Latin (stem ) meaning \"soap\", which, like its common name, refers to its utility in cleaning. From this same Latin word is derived the name of the toxic substance saponin, contained in the roots at levels up to 20 percent when the plant is flowering (Indian soapnuts contain only 15 percent). It produces a lather when in contact with water. The epithet \"officinalis\" indicates its medicinal functions. It is a common host plant for some moth species, including the white-lined sphinx.\n\n\"Saponaria officinalis\" native range extends throughout Europe, and in Asia to western Siberia. It grows in cool places at low or moderate elevations under hedgerows and along the shoulders of roadways. It can be found in much of North America.\n\nThe plant possesses leafy, unbranched stems (often tinged with red). It grows in patches, attaining a height of . The broad, lanceolate, sessile leaves are opposite and between 4 and 12 cm long. Its sweetly scented flowers are radially symmetrical and pink, or sometimes white. Each of the five flat petals have two small scales in the throat of the corolla. They are about wide. They are arranged in dense, terminal clusters on the main stem and its branches. The long tubular calyx has five pointed red teeth.\nThe individual flowers open in the evening, and stay open for about three days. They produce a stronger scent at night and supplement nectar production during the night. The flowers are protandrous: on the second night of blooming, the pollen is released, and the stigma develops to its final position by the third night. Much of the seed production comes from self-pollination. The flowers are visited by various insects including Noctuidae, Sphingidae, bumblebees, and hoverflies.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere \"Saponaria officinalis\" blooms from May to September, and in the Southern Hemisphere October to March.\n\nAs its common name implies, it can be used as a very gentle soap, usually in dilute solution. It has historically been used to clean delicate or unique textiles, especially woollen fabrics; it has been hypothesized that the plant was used to treat the Shroud of Turin.\n\nA lathery liquid that has the ability to dissolve fats or grease can be procured by boiling the leaves or roots in water. Leaves are chopped, boiled, and strained; the liquid can then be used as soap.\n\nIn the Romanian village of Șieu-Odorhei, natives call the plant . It is traditionally used by the villagers as a soap replacement for dry skin.\n\nAn overdose can cause nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\nDespite its toxic potential, \"Saponaria officinalis\" finds culinary use as an emulsifier in the commercial preparation of tahini and in brewing to create beer with a good head. In the Middle East, the root is often used as an additive in the process of making halva. The plant is used to stabilize the oils in the mixture and to create the distinctive texture of halvah.\n\n\"Saponaria officinalis\" contains the flavone saponarin.\n\n"}

The company was named for the Knights Templar and used a Maltese Cross as an emblem.\n\nAdvertising themselves as \"The pioneer builder of quality small cars\", the first Templar car had a four-cylinder, overhead-valve engine of 3.2 litres capacity coupled to a three-speed transmission mounted in a chassis with a wheelbase. The entry of the United States into World War I severely curtailed production, the company making artillery shells for the war effort. Only around 150 cars were made in 1918. Body styles included a coupe with coachwork by Leon Rubay at US$4250, a Victoria Elite tourer, a 3-door sedan and a sports model called the Sportette at US$2400. The cars were extremely well equipped with a compass and Kodak camera as standard equipment.\n\nFull production resumed in 1919 with 3 body types, the coupe, Sportette and sedan. 1800 cars were built by the 900 employees. While the post war boom continued, the company could sell every car it made and Templar even increased prices in 1920 and 1921. The 1921 coupe, still basically the 1917 car, cost US$3785, as did the five-passenger sedan, while the five-seat tourer, four-passenger Sportette, and two-seat touring roadster were US$2885.\n\nBy contrast, an Enger 40 was US$2000, the FAL was US$1750, US$2000, the Oakland 40 US$1600, the Cole 30 and Colt Runabout were each US$1500, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout was US$650, and Western's Gale Model A was US$500, but Templars were still well below the Lozier Light Six Metropolitan tourer and runabout at US$3,250 and coupe US$3,850 or even American's lowest-price model, which was US$4250 (its highest was US$5250), while the 1913 Lozier Big Six tourer and roadster started at US$5,000.\n\nCompetition was increasing, so in 1922, two cheaper models were announced, a roadster and a Deluxe Sports at US$1985. Production was severely affected following a major fire which had swept through the works in December 1921, and receivers were appointed in October 1922.\n\nThe company was re-financed and became the Templar Motor Car Company in 1923, and work started on a 4.3-litre six-cylinder engine, as the new management decided the future was in larger cars. The new models were based around a wheelbase frame with a range of four- and five-seat bodies. Four-wheel brakes were also introduced. However, only 125 cars were sold in 1923.\n\nBy late 1924 it seems the money ran out, and the company passed into the ownership of a local bank who had called in a loan, and production ceased.\n\n\n\n"}

Handbag house is one of the most mainstream and accessible subgenres of electronic dance music. \"The Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture\" defines handbag house as having \"prominent female vocals, breakdowns, and a proliferation of piano 'stabs'.\" Modern diva house compositions use synth stabs and four on the floor rhythms.\n\nThe term \"diva house\" was in use as early as July 1992, when \"Billboard\" magazine described \"What Are We Doin'\" by Dee Dee Simone as \"iron-lunged diva-house.\" It is known for booming unisex vocals, sometimes sampled from other recordings. Such samples come from soul, disco, gospel recordings and even show tunes performed by singers like Bette Midler, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, and other gay icons. This bombastic genre can include songs performed by dance specialists \"(see artists)\" as well as club remixes of pop songs by singers such as Patti LaBelle, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston.\n\nThe term \"handbag house\" appears to be particularly popular on British dancefloors and refers to the notion of a group of female club-goers dancing around a pile of their handbags. Dance culture's usage of the word 'handbag house' started life as a derogatory term.\n\nIn the 1990s, as gay clubs and gay culture became more mainstream so did house music. The accessibility of diva house lead to the mainstreaming of gay club music. In the UK especially, handbag house became emblematic of the clubbing culture. According to music historians Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, by the mid-1990s handbag house had helped to make clubbing into a \"mainstream leisure activity.\" With the mainstreaming of gay culture in the 1990s, \"diva\" was the word that bound house music to the gay dance scene, which was previously only defined by Italo disco compositions.\n\nMusic critic Simon Reynolds asserts that handbag house was \"initially a disparaging term, coined by condescending cognoscenti vis-à-vis the anthemic, chart-penetrating house tunes that allegedly appealed to women, and above all to the folk-mythic construct of Sharon and Tracy.\" According to electronic music producer Ewan Pearson and academic Jeremy Gilbert, \"handbag house\" is often derided as \"plastic disco\" by dance music fans who prefer \"the more esoteric sound of musics which eschew the 'mainstream' musical priorities of melody and verbal language.\" The mainstream appeal of handbag house caused underground dance music purists to flock to the spin-off genres of hardbag, progressive house, deep house, and garage house. Sociologist Dunja Brill argues that criticism of handbag house carries a \"misogynist slant in club cultural representations of the denigrated mainstream of 'Handbag House' against which Ravers define their subculture.\" Brill maintains that bias against handbag house \"is expressed most clearly in a femininisation of the denigrated 'mainstream' of pop culture against which subcultures define themselves.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Bachchan Jr. and Mukerji play con-artist partners-in-crime, Bunty and Babli, while Bachchan Sr. plays JCP Dashrath, whose focus is solely to catch them.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, with lyrics done by Gulzar and Blaaze together, and released under the banner YRF Music. Released worldwide on 27 May 2005, \"Bunty Aur Babli\" was a commercial success, grossing 634 million at the worldwide box office on a budget of 120 million, and was the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year. The film earned eight nominations at the 51st Filmfare Awards including Best Film, Best Actor for Bachchan Jr., Best Actress for Mukerji and Best Supporting Actor for Bachchan Sr. and won three - Best Music for Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Best Lyrics for Gulzar and Best Female Playback for Alisha Chinai, the latter two for the song \"Kajra Re\".\n\nA spiritual sequel under the title of \"Bunty Aur Babli 2\" is set to be released in 2020.\n\nRakesh Trivedi (Abhishek Bachchan) comes from a small village named Fursatganj. His father is a ticket collector on a train and wants him to get into a similar occupation as well. However, Rakesh has big dreams; he is forever coming up with new business plans and is convinced he will make it big one day. He adamantly refuses any notion that he will one day work in a 9-to-5 environment.\n\nVimmi Saluja (Rani Mukerji) is the daughter of a Punjabi family in another small village named Panki Nagar; she spends her hours watching films and studying supermodels. She dreams of becoming Miss India.\n\nVimmi's parents tell her they have arranged her marriage to a young man with a decent job. At the same time, Rakesh's father gives him an ultimatum – go on the job interview he has arranged or get out of the house.\n\nRakesh and Vimmi pack their bags and sneak out in the dark of the night. They bump into each other at a train station and become friends after realising their stories are similar. They support and encourage each other to achieve their dreams: Vimmi tries to enter the Miss India contest but gets thrown out after an argument. Rakesh tries to sell his ideas for an investment scheme, but a businessman turns him away. In fact, a man he had met at a restaurant stole ideas from Rakesh's presentation file and, when he enters the office, the interviewer states someone before he came in with the same idea. After finding out that the businessman who Rakesh approached has used his idea to make money, he and Vimmi con him and take the money that they believe is rightfully theirs.\n\nOnce they realise how easy it is to con people, they decide to run some more cons by raising money to make it to Bombay.\n\nUnfortunately for India, they find the lifestyle too exciting to give up. Adopting the names of 'Bunty' and 'Babli', they successfully pull off con after con, looting rich people dressed as local guides, religious priests, health inspectors, business partners, etc. Their flamboyant antics make them famous in newspapers nationwide. Soon their friendship leads to romance and they decide to continue conning the rich as husband and wife.\n\nLittle do Rakesh and Vimmi know that JCP Dashrath Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) is catching up with their cons and pranks, getting closer each day. He relentlessly pursues them across India in the hopes of putting them behind bars. To complicate matters, Rakesh and Vimmi have a child and, after a very close call eluding Dashrath, they decide to quit conning for their child's sake. This decision leads to their capture by Dashrath. While in custody, their heartfelt confessions and conversation soften the policeman's heart and he lets them go, certain he has destroyed Bunty and Babli's career as criminals.\n\nThree years later, Dashrath rescues them from their mundane domestic lives by offering them to work for the nation thwarting the activities of other scammers.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success becoming one of the biggest hits of 2005. Designer Aki Narula dressed Rani Mukerji a new look Patiala salwars and kurtis, which became quite popular.\n\nThe glorification of crime in the movie inspired many people to emulate the glamorous couple, resulting in a trend of real-life Buntys and Bablis. One such case is that of Shushant and Kajal, a married couple who conned two businesses out of money using a photo frame. \"The Darjeeling-based couple did a 'Bunty Aur Babli' on their victims, and were caught and arrested.\" Another case of the movie's influence on crime is that of another married couple, Suresh and Rekha. Their crimes also mirrored those committed in the movie \"Bunty Aur Babli\", and they admitted to committing the crimes they were accused of in a \"Bunty Aur Babli\" style. Yet another couple, a sister and brother-in-law, were caught for crimes that mirrored those committed in the movie. Shahnaaz Bano and Sajid Ahmed were caught smuggling and shoplifting diamonds and other expensive merchandise out of stores, using disguises.\n\nA. R.

According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 19,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's second highest-selling.\n\nThe music of \"Bunty Aur Babli\" received favourable reviews from almost all critics. Sukanya Verma of \"Rediff\", said in her review, \"On the whole, the music of Bunty Aur Babli, with its over the top, uninhibited, rustic and teasing spices, makes for one helluva musical masala.\" \"Planet Bollywood's\" review concluded, \"Overall, Shakhar-Ehsaan-Loy do an excellent job of getting different singers for each track, trying to infuse different beats together and creating an album worth buying. It’ll take a few listens to pick your favourites, but its fresh and an above average album to own. Enjoy!\" \"Bunty Aur Babli does not contain your routine Yash Chopra genre of music that are choreographed around the meadows and Swiss alps. They are more of situational rhythmic tracks that take a story forward\" Joginder Tuteja of \"Bollywood Hungama\" said in his review. The Glamsham was full of praise for the lyrics by Gulzar, \"Throughout this zany zingy and zippy album the 70-year-old Gulzar imbues a youthfulness that comes from being young at heart. Indeed that's the quality, which flows freely out of this album. You can't miss its zest for life… or its lunge towards a luscious nirvana obtained from looking at life through rose-tinted glasses.\" Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, \"In essence, Bunty Aur Babli is an on-the-road flick about a boy and girl in search of fun and freedom rather than a story of two cons. To capture the splintered yearnings of smalltown India which watches Aastha channel in the morning and FTV at night is a difficult and ambitious task. But like his protagonists, director Shaad Ali Sahgal pulls it off. Bravely. Almost.\" 10\n\n\"Kajra Re\" was voted as the best of 2005 overwhelmingly by listeners of three radio stations catering for South African Indians.\n\nHidekaz Himaruya, the manga artist who created Hetalia, embedded the video of \"Dhadak Dhadak\" on his blog around Christmas time, which caused a sudden influx of Himaruya fans commenting on the video.\n\nIn December 2019, Yash Raj Films announced a spiritual sequel, \"Bunty Aur Babli 2\", to be directed by Varun V. Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra. The film stars Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherji, Siddhant Chaturvedi and debutante Sharvari Wagh as the leads, and is scheduled to release on 26 June 2020.\n"}

Symptoms of untreated tyrosinemia include liver and kidney disturbances. Without treatment, tyrosinemia leads to liver failure. Today, tyrosinemia is increasingly detected on newborn screening tests before any symptoms appear. With early and lifelong management involving a low-protein diet, special protein formula, and sometimes medication, people with tyrosinemia develop normally, are healthy, and live normal lives.\n\nAll tyrosinemias result from dysfunction of various genes in the phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolic pathway, and are inherited in an autosomal-recessive pattern.\n\nType I tyrosinemia results from a mutation in the \"FAH\" gene, which encodes the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase. As a result of \"FAH\" deficiency, the substrate fumarylacetoacetate can accumulate in proximal renal tubular cells and hepatocytes, resulting in damage to the kidney and liver, respectively.\n\nType II tyrosinemia results from a mutation in the \"TAT\" gene, which encodes the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase. As a result of \"TAT\" deficiency, the substrate tyrosine accumulates, causing ophthalmologic and dermatologic abnormalities.\n\nType III tyrosinemia results from a mutation in the \"HPD\" gene, which encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Type III tyrosinemia is the rarest of the three conditions, with only a few cases ever reported. Most of those cases have included intellectual disability and neurologic dysfunction.\n\nType I tyrosinemia can be detected via blood tests for the presence of a fumarylacetoacetate metabolite, succinylacetone, which is considered a pathognomonic indicator for the disease.\n\nType II tyrosinemia can be detected via the presence of significantly elevated plasma tyrosine levels, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by detection of a mutation in \"TAT\" in cultured fibroblasts.\n\nType III tyrosinemia can be diagnosed by detection of a mutation in \"HPD\" in cultured fibroblasts. \n\nTreatment varies depending on the specific type; a low-protein diet combined with the use of a specially engineered formula to supply protein is required in most cases. Experience with nitisinone has shown it to be effective. It is a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Liver transplant is indicated for patients with tyrosinemia type I who do not respond to nitisinone, as well as those with acute liver failure and hepatomas.\n\n\n"}

These cells are constituents of three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The science of the microscopic structures of the tissues formed within histogenesis is termed histology.\n\nA germ layer is a collection of cells, formed during animal and mammalian embryogenesis. Germ layers are typically pronounced within vertebrate organisms; however, animals or mammals more complex than sponges (eumetazoans and ) produce two or three primary tissue layers. Animals with radial symmetry, such as cnidarians, produce two layers, called the ectoderm and endoderm. Therefore, they are diploblastic. Animals with bilateral symmetry produce a third layer in-between called mesoderm, making them triploblastic. Germ layers will eventually give rise to all of an animal’s or mammal's tissues and organs through a process called organogenesis.\n\nThe endoderm is one of the germ to penes \nlayers formed during animal embryogenesis. Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the endoderm. Initially, the endoderm consists of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar.\n\nThe mesoderm germ layer forms in the embryos of animals and mammals more complex than cnidarians, making them triploblastic. During gastrulation, some of the cells migrating inward to form the endoderm form an additional layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. A theory suggests that this key innovation evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and led to the evolution of nearly all large, complex animals. The formation of a mesoderm led to the formation of a coelom. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.\n\nThe ectoderm is the start of a tissue that covers the body surfaces. It emerges first and forms from the outermost of the germ layers.\n\nThe proceeding graph represents the products produced by the three germ layers.\n\n\n\n"}

The center took 4 years to complete, opening in 1978. It was \"built as a cultural center for Seoulites.\" It currently contains the biggest pipe organ in Asia.\n\nAfter the Seoul National Hall was destroyed by fire in 1972, the City Council of Seoul commissioned the construction of a venue to continue the cultural heritage of that structure. Built in 1978, commissioned by the City of Seoul, Sejong Center was largely unsupported financially for 20 years, being under the control of the Special City of Seoul. In 1999, the center was placed under control of a foundation governed by civilians whose passion for the arts fueled its massive newfound success. This venue hosted Miss Universe 1980.\n\nThe center's design was based on a fusion of Korean national symbols and the western architectural designs.

{"id": "2051748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051748", "title": "Chris Simms", "text": "Chris Simms\n\nChristopher David Simms (born August 29, 1980) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Texas.\n\nSimms also played for the Denver Broncos and the Tennessee Titans. He is the son of former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl XXI MVP Phil Simms and the older brother of Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Simms.\n\nSimms grew up in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and attended Ramapo High School there, where he was a standout in both football and basketball. In football, he was a two-time All-State honoree, and was named the 1998 \"USA Today\" National Offensive Player of the Year. Simms graduated from Ramapo High School in 1999. After committing to the University of Tennessee during his senior year, Simms decommitted and enrolled at the University of Texas instead.\n\nSimms played college football at the University of Texas at Austin from 1999 to 2002.\n\nHe spent his freshman year as the backup to Major Applewhite, and saw limited playing time until the end of the season. Going into the Texas A&M game (the so-called Bonfire Game as it followed the tragic death of 12 students during construction of A&M's annual bonfire), Texas was ranked #5, but right before that game, Applewhite got an intestinal virus that kept him up all night and required him to be put on an IV the next day. As a result, Simms got his first career start and had the Longhorns up 16–6 at halftime. After Simms struggled in the 2nd half, and with Texas still ahead, he was replaced by Applewhite in the 4th quarter, but Applewhite was not able to get Texas any points, they fell behind in the last 6 minutes and Applewhite fumbled on their last possession. Simms took over again during the Cotton Bowl, when Applewhite suffered a knee injury in the 4th quarter.\n\nThe next season Applewhite was again the starter, but Simms was more of a co-quarterback than a backup. After Applewhite played poorly in a loss to Stanford in the 2nd game, Simms was given his second career start in the following game against Houston. Simms struggled early and Applewhite got the majority of the snaps in what turned out to be a rout resulting in Applewhite regaining the role as starter. Simms would again get a chance to start when Applewhite suffered a season-ending knee injury on the last drive of the Texas Tech game. Simms played well, throwing for 240 yards or more in each game, including a 383-yard game against #21 Texas A&M, the most ever by a Texas QB against the Aggies. Texas went 2–1 with Simms as quarterback, with the only loss against #8 Oregon, a game Texas could have won - despite Simms setting the record for interceptions in a Holiday Bowl game with 4, but for three dropped touchdown passes on the last drive. Mack Brown was impressed enough to name Simms the starter before the start of spring practice, a decision that proved controversial.\n\nThe Longhorns were ranked #5 to start the 2001 season and Simms' play through the first four games was good enough to keep them there. But in the Red River Showdown, Texas faced #3 Oklahoma and Simms' four interceptions, including one in the Sooners' end zone and one that was returned for a touchdown, sealed Oklahoma's victory. Nonetheless, Simms recovered to lead Texas to six straight wins with five straight 200-yard passing games, including a dominating win over #14 Colorado and his second straight win over the Aggies, a #3 ranking, and a rematch against #10 Colorado in the Big 12 Championship Game on December 1. Because of an upset loss by Florida to Tennessee earlier in the day, Texas went into the game knowing that a win would likely put them in the 2002 BCS Championship Game. But Simms had a disastrous game. He was responsible for four turnovers (three interceptions and a fumble) in the first half of play. In the 2nd quarter, after being booed by Texas fans, Simms injured his finger and Applewhite entered the game with Texas down, 29–10. Applewhite led Texas back to within 2 points, but eventually Texas would come up short losing 39–37 after an onside kick attempt failed. Applewhite's strong play, combined with Simms' injury, resulted in Simms sitting out the 2001 Holiday Bowl.\n\nTexas came into the 2002 season with high hopes and a #2 ranking. Simms was the starter all season, and he threw for a career-high 3,207 yards, 2nd to only Applewhite at the time. Texas won its first 5 games and then faced their first challenge against #3 Oklahoma. Texas led in that game until the 4th quarter, when a 3rd Simms interception set up Oklahoma's winning touchdown. Simms and Texas recovered to beat #17 Kansas State and #17 Iowa State in back to back weeks followed by wins over Nebraska and Baylor to climb back up to #3 in the rankings. But the following week, Texas Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury threw for 473 yards to upset the Longhorns 42–38, despite Simms playing one of his best games, and scuttle their national championship dreams. Simms capped his year with his 3rd straight victory over Texas A&M and his first bowl win over #25 LSU in the Cotton Bowl. In the Cotton Bowl he threw for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception - with more than half of those yards going to Cotton Bowl MVP Roy Williams. Simms was named the team's MVP for the season.\n\nHe finished with a career record of 26–6, second largest number of wins, at the time, to Bobby Layne. He also played in the 2002 Senior Bowl in which he threw an interception that went for a Senior Bowl record 99 yard return.\n\n\nBold means active\n\nSimms was drafted with the last pick of the 3rd round in 2003 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the expectation that he would eventually be the successor to Brad Johnson. He was cast third on the Bucs depth chart behind Johnson and former Buccaneers starter Shaun King. Simms sat his entire rookie year without playing a single snap in the regular season.\n\nIn 2004, Simms started the season as the 3rd string quarterback again, this time behind Johnson and former Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins starter Brian Griese, but quickly advanced to backup quarterback after a poor preseason by Griese. Simms saw his first action on September 19, 2004 against the Seattle Seahawks after a below-average performance by Johnson, coming into the game with 10:32 left in the 2nd quarter. Simms went 21–32 with 175 yards and an interception. Simms received his first start two games later against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, 2004 after the Bucs started 0–4 and Johnson was benched for his poor performance. Simms went 5–8 for 75 yards but injured his shoulder early in the game and missed three weeks, allowing Brian Griese to secure the position with 3 straight wins. Simms saw occasional action as the backup QB to Griese and started a meaningless final game against the Arizona Cardinals where he threw for 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.\n\nIn 2005, Simms was slated on the depth chart as the backup quarterback, behind Griese and ahead of former Cleveland Browns starting quarterback Luke McCown. Simms got his first snap of the season after Miami Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas was pushed onto Griese's leg with several minutes left in the game on October 16, 2005. Despite the injury, the Buccaneers prevailed 27–13 in the game in which Griese was lost for the season. Simms performed well, completing 6 of 10 passes for 69 yards. Simms got his first start of the season the following week against a weak San Francisco 49ers squad. While Simms had decent numbers (21–34, 264 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions), his performance was considered poor, as there were many times when he underthrew his receivers, missed open receivers, or incorrectly read the defensive coverage. Simms followed up this performance with about the same performance (25–42, 259 yards, 1 touchdowns, 2 interceptions) against the division rival Carolina Panthers, who were considered a much better team than San Francisco. After these two losses however, Simms performed better than expected and had a knack for late-game heroics. He led fourth-quarter charges against fellow division rival Atlanta twice, as well as the Washington Redskins. The Redskin game was his best performance of the year as Simms threw for 3 scores as the Buccaneers won 36–35 in a remarkable game. Simms had a much more impressive performance in the rematch against Carolina on the road. The two losses in this stretch were against the defending Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots, and the Chicago Bears, who were ranked #1 in the league in total defense, and in both of these games, Simms did not throw any interceptions, but was sacked a combined 11 times. He even led Tampa Bay to another fourth-quarter comeback against the Bears but a 29-yard field goal attempt floated wide right, giving the Bears a 13–10 victory.\n\nSimms led the Buccaneers to their first playoff berth since their Super Bowl victory in the 2002 season. In the rematch vs. the Redskins Simms led Tampa Bay back again from a 17–3 halftime deficit. With the score at 17–10 late in the fourth quarter, Simms hit Edell Shepherd on an apparent 35-yard touchdown strike. However, Shepherd failed to maintain possession as he hit the ground. Tampa Bay lost 17–10 in a game where Washington gained only 120 yards of offense, the lowest total for a playoff winner in NFL history.\nSimms suffered a season-ending injury in Game 3 of the 2006 schedule. On Sunday, September 24, he was taken off the field after taking hard hits from the Carolina Panthers defense. Simms returned to the game and even led a successful scoring drive, but remained in physical distress and was taken to a nearby hospital after the game. Tests revealed a ruptured spleen, and Simms immediately underwent emergency surgery. In the aftermath, Simms said he lost five pints of blood before the operation and conceded that another 45 minutes without treatment could have been fatal. The injury is believed by some to have been caused by an illegal hit from Al Wallace, who was later fined by the NFL. However, Simms was complaining of pain and shortness of breath, symptoms of a spleen issue, prior to the hit. Playing on a one-year, $2.1 million contract signed before the season, Simms was eligible for free agency for 2007.\n\nOn December 27, 2006, Simms announced that he had signed a two-year extension to remain with the Buccaneers with the expectation that he would start. However, due to complications from his recovery and the performance of Jeff Garcia in mini-camp, Simms was expected to serve as a backup to Garcia. On October 9, Simms was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season. The Bucs were expected to keep Simms on the roster for mini camp as their fifth quarterback.\n\nSimms' relationship with head coach Jon Gruden worsened significantly during this period. Simms attributed his lack of playing time to how Gruden treated him during his recovery from the spleen injury. He has even said that \"The relationship between me and coach Gruden, it’s broken,\" Simms said. \"And I don’t see any way it’s going to get better.\" Simms also said that he will never forgive Gruden, although he still respects the Buccaneers as an organization.\n\nOn August 30, 2008, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers released Simms. He worked out with the Baltimore Ravens during the preseason but was not signed.\n\nSimms signed with the Tennessee Titans on September 9, 2008 after starter Vince Young was sidelined with a sprained MCL. In Young's absence, Simms served as the backup quarterback behind Kerry Collins until October 3, when Simms was released to make room for punter Josh Miller. Simms was re-signed the following week on October 6.\n\nOn March 4, 2009, Simms signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Denver Broncos. The deal included a $1.5 million signing bonus and Simms could have earned an additional $3 million through incentives. He was the backup quarterback to Kyle Orton. However, he took over in the second half of a game against the Washington Redskins after Orton left with a sprained ankle, and eventually gave up the lead to the Redskins while going 3–13 passing for 13 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. He started against the San Diego Chargers on November 22, 2009 but was quickly replaced by Orton in the second quarter after going a disappointing 2 for 4 for only 10 yards. He was released on March 15, 2010 after the Broncos traded for Brady Quinn.\n\nOn April 12, 2010, Simms was re-signed by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nOn September 4, 2010, Simms was cut from the Titans roster. On November 22, 2010, he was re-signed to be a backup quarterback behind Rusty Smith, after the season-ending injury to Vince Young. He was not brought back for the 2011 season, nor was he picked up by another team.\n\nSimms was hired as a coaching assistant by the New England Patriots on March 26, 2012. He had two main roles. One was in offensive quality control which involved breaking down film for the offense. He also had responsibilities in putting together the scouting report.\n\nOn July 22, 2013, Chris Simms was included in Fox Sports' commentator lineup for the 2013 college football season. He made his debut as color commentator when West Virginia University played the College of William & Mary on August 31, 2013.\n\nChris Simms joined Bleacher Report in February 2014 as an NFL Analyst, a high-profile hire for Time-Warner and Turner Sports's rapidly growing mobile product, Team Stream.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, Simms was as a color commentator for the \"NFL on CBS\", joining his father as part of the CBS broadcasting team. He left after the 2016 season to join his father's old employer, NBC Sports, where he is a studio analyst for Notre Dame football and a personality on NBC Sports Radio. In March 2019, Simms left Bleacher Report to become a full-time employee of NBC working as an analyst for Football Night In America and Notre Dame football, as well as co-host of NBC Sports Radio/NBCSN program \"ProFootballTalk Live\".\n\nSimms married Danielle Marie Puleo in August 2004, whom he first met in high school. Together, they have two children: Charlotte, born in 2006, and Phillip, born in 2010.\n\nSimms was arrested in July 2010 and charged with driving while intoxicated, but was acquitted at trial in May 2011.\n"}
{"id": "2051753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051753", "title": "Stuck on You (film)", "text": "Stuck on You (film)\n\nStuck on You is a 2003 American comedy film directed by the Farrelly brothers and starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as conjoined twins, whose conflicting aspirations provide both conflict and humorous situations, in particular when one of them wishes to move to Hollywood to pursue a career as an actor.\n\nConjoined twins Bob and Walt Tenor try to live as normally as possible. Outgoing and sociable Walt aspires to be a Hollywood actor, however, whereas shy, introverted Bob prefers the quiet life. They run Quikee Burger, a diner in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, that guarantees free meals to customers whose orders are not completed in three minutes, a testament to how skilled and in sync Bob and Walt are with each other. Though Walt is comfortable socializing with women, Bob is the shyer of the two, and carries on a long-distance relationship with a pen pal named May Fong whom he has never met in person, and who is unaware that they are conjoined twins.\n\nWalt gets a role in a local play. Bob stays as much as possible in the background, as he has a tendency to get stage fright. Following the play's success, Walt decides to follow his dream to Hollywood and persuades his hesitant brother to go along for the ride.\nThey rent an apartment in California and become friends with fellow aspiring actress April Mercedes. When she expresses curiosity about their conjoinment, Walt explains that they share a liver that is mostly Bob's, and that because surgical separation entails risk to Walt, Bob would not consent to the surgery, even though Walt favored it. It is also the reason why Walt appears somewhat older than Bob. (Greg Kinnear is seven years older than Matt Damon in real life.)\n\nWalt's efforts to find acting work in Hollywood are fraught with difficulty, and his agent, Morty O'Reilly, is little help, offering at one point to get him a job in a pornographic film. Cher is upset that she has ended up starring in a prime-time TV show called \"Honey and the Beaze\". She wants out of the deal, so she decides to hire Walt as her co-star (since her contract states she can choose anyone she wants), certain the show will get cancelled. The producers, realizing Cher's scheme, foil it by going forward with the production, compensating for Bob's presence by keeping him out of the camera frame and employing bluescreen effects. The show is a surprise hit and Walt becomes famous.\n\nWalt arranges for May Fong to come to California. Although he did this without Bob's consent, Bob and May Fong develop a romantic relationship, though the twins' attempt to keep their conjoined nature a secret proves challenging, especially since Walt must accompany the new couple everywhere, sometimes using creative solutions like disguising himself as a giant teddy bear. Eventually however, when May discovers the twins in bed, she concludes that they are a homosexual couple rather than brothers. Although Bob shows May that they are indeed conjoined twins, May is nonetheless in even greater shock at the deception, and flees.\n\nMorty informs the twins that word has leaked about Walt and Bob being conjoined. Rather than hide this, the twins decide to embrace it, and they both become huge celebrities, making commercials and appearing on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". While Walt enjoys this success, he knows that Bob is unhappy because he misses May. Resolving that Bob needs to be independent from him in order to be happy, Walt demands they be surgically separated. When Bob refuses, Walt, determined to convince him, begins acting wild and crazy until Bob can no longer take it. Walt starts to make a fool of himself by getting drunk and accidentally snatching a woman's purse. They eventually end up spending the night in jail for drunk driving; even though Walt was drinking, Bob is the one who suffers the hangover since their shared liver is mostly his. When they are released the following morning, they get into a fight and Bob decides to go with the operation.\n\nOn the night before the surgery, May shows up and apologizes to Bob for running out the way she did. Bob informs her that they're getting separated; although she does not want them to, he knows that it's best for them. At the hospital, May and April keep a vigil until learning from Ben Carson, a real-life neurosurgeon playing a cameo role, that the surgery was successful. Bob and May, both being small-town people, decide to move back to Oak Bluffs, but Bob finds the separation from Walt difficult, both practically and emotionally, and is unable to do the things by himself that the twins used to do together, such as maintain Quikee Burger's three-minute challenge or play hockey. Walt, for his part, loses his job when \"Honey and the Beaze\" is canceled due to low ratings, and finds it difficult to find subsequent work. He is also emotionally devastated by Bob's absence. After having a brief talk with Cher about what's best for him, he decides to move back to Oak Bluffs.\n\nOne year later, Walt and Bob are back in Oak Bluffs running the restaurant together, Bob and May have married and May is pregnant. The twins simulate their former conjoinment with Velcro clothing that attaches them to one another. Walt finds creative fulfillment continuing in local plays, including a musical in which he and Meryl Streep play Bonnie and Clyde.\n\n\n\nThe song \"Human\" recorded by Cher, who appears in the film, and produced by David Kahne was included in the soundtrack (Flynn cover). There was no official release, but in Germany the song was released on a promotional CD of the soundtrack called \"Unzertrennlich\" and that version clocks 3:49. The original 4:25 version was never released. The song can be heard during the end credits of the film and is played during a scene in a club. This is the first Farrelly Brothers film not to have an official soundtrack.\n\nThe song \"Moonlight Feels Right\" by Starbuck, written and produced by lead singer/keyboardist Bruce Blackman also appears in the film.\n\nPete Yorn recorded a cover of the Albert Hammond classic \"It Never Rains in Southern California\" for the film, and like the aforementioned Cher song, remains unreleased. The Kings of Leon songs \"California Waiting\", \"Molly Chambers\" and \"Holy Roller Novocaine\" are all featured in the film as well, from the band's first EP \"Holy Roller Novacaine\". Greg Kinnear's version of \"Summertime\" is an almost note-for-note cover of the Billy Stewart version. Eight minutes out in the movie, while at a bar, Morten Abel's song \"Welcome Home\" is played.\n\nThe country song played over the closing credits The Fear of Being Alone is sung by George Schappell (credited as Reba), one of a set of conjoined twins who is mentioned in the film.\n\nReview website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 61% based on 158 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10, with the consensus: \"An unusually sweet and charming comedy by the Farrelly brothers. Fans may miss the distinct lack of bodily fluids though.\"\n\nThe film broke even on its $55 million production budget with $65,784,503 worldwide, its box office draw considerably underperformed the Farrelly Brothers' previous hits. It only managed third place in its opening weekend box office (US) despite having the largest theater count of any release that weekend (December 12–14, 2003).\n\n"}

He was selected 121st overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by his hometown team, the Edmonton Oilers, mostly because of his outstanding skating. Chimera played three seasons on the Hamilton Bulldogs, which at that point was the Oilers' farm team in the American Hockey League. In his final season, he was named to the AHL First All-Star team.\n\nChimera played two seasons for Edmonton before being traded to the Phoenix Coyotes for draft choices. Because of the NHL lockout, he did not play the following season and went to play in Italy for Mastini Varese. Chimera was subsequently dealt to the Columbus Blue Jackets, without playing a game in Phoenix, as part of a trade for Geoff Sanderson.\n\nWith the Blue Jackets, Chimera predominantly played left wing on the team's third line.

In 2013, \"Red and Rover\" received the Reuben Award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip by the National Cartoonists Society. On Sunday, May 7, 2000, \"Red and Rover\" appeared in newspapers for the first time. \n\nBasset had been producing the comic strip \"Adam\" (now known as \"Adam@home\") since 1984. In 1998, he began thinking about producing a second comic strip that had a more childlike quality to it.\n\nIn 2009, after nearly 25 years of drawing \"Adam@home\", Basset decided to focus squarely on \"Red and Rover\" and he handed over the illustration duties of the older strip to \"Big Top\" artist Rob Harrell.\n\nOriginally syndicated for the first ten years by The Washington Post Writers Group, \"Red and Rover\" is currently syndicated to over 200 papers by Andrews McMeel Syndication.\n\n\"Red and Rover\" is usually set around the end of the 1960s or the beginning of the 1970s, although a strip from November 20, 2009, depicted a car which bears a striking resemblance to a mid-1970s Ford Country Squire station wagon, and in a Sunday strip from August 28, 2011 Red plays a parody of \"Jaws\", a film from 1975.\n\nRed (real name Russell McLean) is a ten-year-old with dreams of going into space one day.

The team first appeared in \"Adventure Comics\" #293 (February 1962), although each of the members had appeared individually in earlier issues.\n\nThe first super-pet crossover story was published in \"Action Comics\" #277 (June 1961), \"Battle of the Super-Pets\", in which Krypto and Streaky competed with each other. The story ended with the surprise appearance of Beppo, who had appeared a couple of years earlier in \"Superboy\".\n\nSignificant appearances during the Legion's \"Adventure Comics\" run include issue #322 (July 1964) in which Proty II is initiated onto the team; issue #343 (April 1966) in which the Super-Pets help the Legion battle the Luck Lords; and issue #364 (January 1968), \"The Revolt of the Super-Pets!\" The team only rarely appeared after the Silver Age and have not made any appearances post-Crisis, though Krypto has become a supporting character in the Superman titles.\n\nThe alien creatures known as the Brain-Globes of Rambat decide that in order to succeed in their plan to move Earth to their own solar system, they must defeat Superboy. When they are unable to gain control of Superboy, they summon Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad, and Saturn Girl of the Legion of Super-Heroes from the future and mentally command the trio to capture him.\n\nAfter Superboy is defeated, the Brain-Globes of Rambat release their hold on the Legionnaires. When they notice that the Brain-Globes cannot control animals, the Legionnaires gather Krypto the Super-Dog (from Superboy's present), Streaky the Supercat and Beppo the Super-Monkey (from Superman's present), and Comet the Super-Horse (from a few weeks in Superman's future) to battle the aliens. The pets defeat the aliens and are named the Legion of Super-Pets, the animal branch of the super club. They are then returned to their proper time periods. Proty II would later join the team.\n\nAn assembly of new Super-Pets was seen in Super Sons Annual #1. This version in the post New 52 and DC Rebirth universe consists of Krypto, Titus (Damian Wayne's dog), Streaky, Flexi the Plastic Bird (a parrot with Plastic Man's powers), Bat-Cow, and Clay Critter (likely a broken off part of Clayface). The group broke apart after a battle with Dex-Starr and Harley Quinn's hyenas Bud and Lou resulted in Clay Critter's demise.

It was a member of the Trades Union Congress. In March 2017, NUT members endorsed a proposed merger with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers to form a new union known as the National Education Union, which came into existence on 1 September 2017. The union recruited only qualified teachers and those training to be qualified teachers into membership and on dissolution had almost 400,000 members, making it the largest teachers' union in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe NUT campaigned on educational issues and working conditions for its members. Among the NUT's policies in 2017 were:\nThe NUT offered legal protection to its members. The NUT established two financial services companies for teachers, Teachers Assurance in 1877 and the Teachers Building Society in 1966.\n\nThe NUT was established at a meeting at King's College London on 25 June 1870 as the National Union of Elementary Teachers (NUET) to represent all school teachers in England and Wales combining a number of local teacher associations which had formed across the country following the 1870 Education Act. After toying with the idea of changing the name to the National Union of English Teachers, the name National Union of Teachers (NUT) was finally adopted at Annual Conference in April 1889.\n\nIn 1919, in response to an NUT referendum approving the principle of equal pay, a ginger group, the National Association of Men Teachers (NAMT), was formed within the NUT to further the interests of male teachers. The NAMT changed its name in 1920 to the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) and seceded finally from the NUT in 1922. The secession came about indirectly following a decision at the NAS Conference that year to prohibit NAS members from continuing to also be members of the NUT after the 31 December 1922. The NAS is now amalgamated into the NASUWT, the second-largest teaching union in the UK.\n\nThe NUT first established its offices at 7 Adam Street, Adelphi, London WC on the appointment of the first full-time Secretary in 1873. In 1889 it moved its headquarters to Bolton House, 67/71 Russell Square, London WC. In 1915, it moved its headquarters to Hamilton House, Mabledon Place, London WC1H 9BD, where it has remained ever since, except during the Second World War, when the NUT rented Toddington Manor, Gloucestershire in order to avoid air raids.\n\nThe General Secretary was the leader of the NUT. From 1989, the General Secretary was elected by the union's membership, with each term lasting five years.\n\n\nThe NUT annual conference took place every spring. The timing always coincided with Easter weekend: starting on Good Friday and ending on Easter Tuesday and took place in various locations. The last NUT Conference was held in Cardiff in 2017. Following the NUT amalgamation with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers on 1 September 2017 there will be a National Education Union - NUT Section held in Brighton in 2018.\n\nNamed after former General Secretary Fred Jarvis and his late wife, the Fred and Anne Jarvis Award was established in 2007 and was presented annually by the NUT to individuals other than NUT members who campaigned tirelessly for all children and young people.

{"id": "2051812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051812", "title": "Proportional control", "text": "Proportional control\n\nProportional control, in engineering and process control, is a type of linear feedback control system in which a correction is applied to the controlled variable which is proportional to the difference between the desired value (setpoint, SP) and the measured value (process variable, PV). Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl float proportioning valve and the fly-ball governor.\n\nThe proportional control concept is more complex than an on–off control system like a bi-metallic domestic thermostat, but simpler than a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control system used in something like an automobile cruise control. On–off control will work where the overall system has a relatively long response time, but can result in instability if the system being controlled has a rapid response time. Proportional control overcomes this by modulating the output to the controlling device, such as a control valve at a level which avoids instability, but applies correction as fast as practicable by applying the optimum quantity of proportional gain.\n\nA drawback of proportional control is that it cannot eliminate the residual SP − PV error in processes with compensation e.g. temperature control, as it requires an error to generate a proportional output. To overcome this the PI controller was devised, which uses a proportional term (P) to remove the gross error, and an integral term (I) to eliminate the residual offset error by integrating the error over time to produce an \"I\" component for the controller output.\n\nIn the proportional control algorithm, the controller output is proportional to the error signal, which is the difference between the setpoint and the process variable. In other words, the output of a proportional controller is the multiplication product of the error signal and the proportional gain.\n\nThis can be mathematically expressed as\n\nwhere\nConstraints: In a real plant, actuators have physical limitations that can be expressed as constraints on formula_3. For example, formula_3 may be bounded between −1 and +1 if those are the maximum output limits.\n\nQualifications: It is preferable to express formula_4 as a unitless number. To do this, we can express formula_5 as a ratio with the span of the instrument. This span is in the same units as error (e.g. C degrees) so the ratio has no units.\n\nProportional control dictates formula_13. From the block diagram shown, assume that \"r\", the setpoint, is the flowrate into a tank and \"e\" is \"error\", which is the difference between setpoint and measured process output. formula_14 is process transfer function; the input into the block is flow rate and output is tank level. \n\nThe output as a function of the setpoint, \"r\", is known as the \"closed-loop transfer function\".\nformula_15 If the poles of formula_16 are stable, then the closed-loop system is stable.\n\nFor a first-order process, a general transfer function is formula_17. Combining this with the closed-loop transfer function above returns formula_18. Simplifying this equation results in formula_19 where formula_20 and formula_21. For stability in this system, formula_22; therefore, formula_23 must be a positive number, and formula_24 (standard practice is to make sure that formula_25). \n\nIntroducing a step change to the system gives the output response of formula_26. \n\nUsing the final-value theorem, \n\nformula_27\n\nwhich shows that there will always be an offset in the system.\n\nFor an integrating process, a general transfer function is formula_28, which, when combined with the closed-loop transfer function, becomes formula_29. \n\nIntroducing a step change to the system gives the output response of formula_26.\n\nUsing the final-value theorem,\n\nformula_31\n\nmeaning there is no offset in this system. This is the only process that will not have any offset when using a proportional controller.\n\nProportional control cannot eliminate the offset error, which is the difference between the desired value and the actual value, SP − PV error, as it requires an error to generate an output. When a disturbance (deviation from existing state) occurs in the process value being controlled, any corrective control action, based purely on Proportional Control, will always leave out the error between the next steady state and the desired setpoint, and result in a residual error called the offset error. This error will increase as greater process demand is put on the system, or by increasing the set point.\n\nConsider an object suspended by a spring as a simple proportional control. The spring will attempt to maintain the object in a certain location despite disturbances which may temporarily displace it. Hooke's law tells us that the spring applies a corrective force that is proportional to the object's displacement. While this will tend to hold the object in a particular location, the absolute resting location of the object will vary if its mass is changed. This difference in resting location is the offset error.\n\nImagine the same spring and object in a weightless environment. In this case, the spring will tend to hold the object in the same location regardless of its mass. There is no offset error in this case because the proportional action is not working against anything in the steady state.\n\nThe proportional band is the band of controller output over which the final control element (a control valve, for instance) will move from one extreme to another. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nformula_32 <br>\n\nSo if formula_4, the proportional gain, is very high, the proportional band is very small, which means that the band of controller output over which the final control element will go from minimum to maximum (or vice versa) is very small. This is the case with on–off controllers, where formula_4 is very high and hence, for even a small error, the controller output is driven from one extreme to another.\n\nThe clear advantage of proportional over on–off control can be demonstrated by car speed control. An analogy to on–off control is driving a car by applying either full power or no power and varying the duty cycle, to control speed. The power would be on until the target speed is reached, and then the power would be removed, so the car reduces speed. When the speed falls below the target, with a certain hysteresis, full power would again be applied. It can be seen that this would obviously result in poor control and large variations in speed. The more powerful the engine; the greater the instability, the heavier the car; the greater the stability. Stability may be expressed as correlating to the power-to-weight ratio of the vehicle. \n\nIn proportional control, the power output is always proportional to the (actual versus target speed) error. If the car is at target speed and the speed increases slightly due to a falling gradient, the power is reduced slightly, or in proportion to the change in error, so that the car reduces speed gradually and reaches the new target point with very little, if any, \"overshoot\", which is much smoother control than on–off control. In practice, PID controllers are used for this and the large number of control processes that require more response control than proportional alone.\n\n\n"}

His early research, which formed the basis of his PhD thesis, was biological and focussed on the endocrinological effects of opioids on cortisol, growth hormone and insulin. He also systematically investigated the effect of naloxone on the pupil and developed this research into an accurate, non-invasive test for opioid dependence, which uniquely permits the rapid differentiation of opiate dependence from non-dependent use in an outpatient setting; international patents have been taken out for both the Ghodse Opioid Addiction Test (GOAT) and the pupilometer components of the test, which was selected as one of the 1000 UK Millennium Products.\n\nAnother important area of research was the development of epidemiological methods of studying the extent and nature of drug-related problems and the evaluation of the reliability and validity of various indicators. These included major surveys of accident and emergency departments and long term studies of coroners' courts and of the Home Office Index of Addict Deaths. Continuation of this 30-year-long research on mortality led to the development of a unique national database including the establishment of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (NPSAD). An understanding of the \"natural history\" of addiction is fundamental to understanding the condition and to evaluating the effect of different treatments. Professor Ghodse's follow-up studies of cohorts of addicts therefore made a significant contribution to knowledge in this area. He also carried out systematic evaluation of different pharmacological treatments as well as the settings in which treatment takes place.\n\nThe epidemiological methods that he pioneered were selected by WHO for international studies and his studies have contributed significantly to international policy formation. His investigations on the role of different healthcare professionals in the rational use of psychoactive drugs were important in the development of WHO guidelines on this subject. He also developed an index for the assessment of rational prescribing which was accepted by WHO as an advancement of drug utilisation research. His multicentre European studies on drugs and mental health and \"Treat 2000\" are contributing to the understanding of drug-related psychosis and treatment outcome of opioid addictions. He was the lead investigator in a multicentre study on the treatment of tobacco addiction in general and psychiatric hospitals and developed a toolkit for use in these settings.\n\nHe established the International Centre for Drug Policy at St George's University of London and over the years attracted substantial funding for research programmes and projects in psychiatry, mental health, addictions and medical education. He was President of the European Collaborating Centres on Addiction Studies (ECCAS).\n\nProfessor Ghodse was appointed to the first established Chair in Addictive Behaviour in the UK in 1987. He established undergraduate, postgraduate and multi-professional training programmes in addiction, the benefit of which is reflected in the numbers of senior academics, consultant psychiatrists, public health practitioners, specialist nurses, social workers and psychologists leading the delivery of services in communities throughout the United Kingdom and many other parts of the world. A long list of teaching and training programmes which Professor Ghodse helped to establish includes addiction prevention in primary care, and educational courses for general practitioners and for prison service medical and nursing staff. He directed a national programme for the development and implementation of a Corporate Substance Misuse Curriculum in Medical Schools in the UK.\n\nFor many years he was Chairman of the subject panel of Psychiatry and Co-ordinator of Higher Degree Examinations of the University of London. He was Chairman of the Association of Professors of Psychiatry in the British Isles.\n\nHamid Ghodse was one of the 13 elected members of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board from 1992 to his death. He was the first scientist to be the President of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, and was elected to this position for a record ten times. During this time he helped to modernise and lead the Board, gaining the confidence of the public and governments of all nations, as a truly respected and highly regarded organisation and helping to stem the scourge of narcotic abuse and trafficking. Over the years he vigorously tried to bring to the attention of governments the need to ensure adequate access to narcotic analgesics and other internationally controlled drugs for legitimate medical and scientific purposes. He addressed the UN, CND, ECOSOC and the World Health Assembly as well as national parliaments and international conferences and was an advocate for debate on controversial drug-related issues. He played an important role in a number of national and international civil societies, organisations and NGOs and was always supportive of their eminent contribution to all aspects of health.\n\nProfessor Ghodse was Medical Director of the National Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards (ACCEA) for England and Wales, Chairman of the International Health Advisory Board (IHAB) and the Senior Professional advisor to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. He was awarded the highest honour of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, by being elected an Honorary Fellow in 2006, and was made an Honorary Fellow of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) in 2008 and International Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). He published over 350 papers, chapters and a number of books, of which those on legal and clinical aspects have become standard works. Some of his other books, \"Addiction at Work\" (Gower Publishing), \"International Drug Control in 21st Century\" (Ashgate Publishing), \"Ghodse's Drugs and Addictive Behaviour\"(4th Edition, Cambridge University Press) and \"Substance Abuse Disorders\" (Wiley-Blackwell Publication) are other ground-breaking works. He was an Advisor on analgesic and on psychotropic medication (Section 4) to the British National Formulary from 1982. One of his research papers won the SIGP 2004 Prize for best psychopharmacological paper in the British Journal of Psychiatry. In 1999 Ghodse was appointed as an honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his dedication to research and clinical practice.\n\n"}

It also connects to the Midland Highway towards Ballarat, and the Hamilton Highway. Sections one and two were officially opened 14 December 2008, with section three on 14 June 2009. Section four recently opened in January 2013 extending to the Princes Highway at Mount Moriac, which now avoids the narrow and windy road from Waurn Ponds towards Winchelsea.\n\nOne of the first plans for a ring road of Geelong dates back to 7 March 1969, when a report was released by the then Geelong Regional Planning Authority. It said that the ring road could be delayed for up to 15 years.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the Geelong Regional Planning Authority, Chairman by Colin K. Atkins OAM, sponsored the Geelong Transportation Plan, which canvassed a number of options for major road construction in the area. One was for a north–south freeway along the line of Latrobe Terrace, though Geelong West and Chilwell, and another was for Aberdeen Street to be upgraded into a major road with the acquisition of 99 houses. Any freeway construction through the suburbs of the city was vetoed after residents objections. The final plan advocated the construction of what became the Geelong Ring Road, although it also proposed that Latrobe Terrace become a 4-lane arterial road.\n\nIn 1979 a Melbourne firm carry out acoustic testing at Wandana Heights to ascertain the impact of a freeway. The alignment was finalised in 1979 and appeared as a proposed freeway in the Melway street directory for a number of years.\n\nGrowing traffic volumes through the centre of Geelong led to Latrobe Terrace being converted into a major arterial road in early 1989, with the construction of a bridge over the Geelong-Melbourne railway line at its northern end, and the James Harrison Bridge over the Barwon River at its southern end.\n\nThe project was renamed the Geelong Ring Road on 20 February 2007.\nConstruction on the Geelong Ring Road began in early 2006 with the freeway section to Waurn Ponds scheduled for completion in 2009. A total of $384 million from the Victorian and Federal Governments was committed initially to fund the first three sections of the project.\n\nThe Geelong Ring Road (freeway type) was to be constructed in three sections as follows:\nThere was much local debate on the proposed route for Section 3. The final decision was made on 7 July 2006, while construction commenced in September 2007. There will be no toll when the Geelong Ring Road opens to traffic.\n\n\nIn October 2007, during the 2007 Federal election campaign the Labor party promised $107.5 million for the fourth stage of the road. It was made up of $45 million for stage 4B, on top of their promise made in September for $62.5 million towards Stage 4A. In May 2008 stages 4A and 4B were given the go ahead, with State Premier John Brumby announcing $65 million in funding for stage 4B, in addition to earlier State Government funding of $63 million for stage 4A. Running from the Princes Highway at Waurn Ponds; it will run from Anglesea Road near Hams Road, through the Blue Circle Quarry to the Princes Highway, near Draytons Road.\n\nOn 17 December 2008 a $62 million contract was awarded to Fulton Hogan to design and build section 4A of the ring road to Anglesea Road.\n\nThe State and Federal Governments have also each committed $110 million to duplicate the Princes Highway to Winchelsea. An extra stage connecting the road to the Surf Coast Highway is also being investigated, but the Government has not put a timeframe on when a final decision will be made.\n\nA shared bicycle and pedestrian pathway has also been built along the freeway from Broderick Road, Corio to Church Street, Hamlyn Heights. Built at a cost of $4 million, the trail will not connect into the Geelong bicycle network, due to a short missing link between Church Street and the Fyansford Common.\n\nSections 1 and 2\n\nThe design and construction contract for the 10.5 km long section 1 was awarded to Abigroup in November 2005 for $134.8 million. Construction work commenced on 17 February 2006.\nSection 2 was delivered via two separate design and construction contracts. The contract for 4.5 km of freeway was awarded to Cut and Fill Pty Ltd for $31.7 million, while FRH (now Fulton Hogan) won the $15.5 million contract for the Moorabool River bridges. Construction work on section two commenced on 27 September 2006.\n\nThe Creamery Road overpass in Bell Post Hill was the first major element of the project to be opened in January 2007 (a number of minor access road deviations had been completed earlier). The Broderick Road overpass was opened in November 2007. The 200m long bridges over the Moorabool River, the largest on the project, had the final span installed on 6 March 2008. The bridges contain 70 beams and have 12 piers.\n\nIn 2007 VicRoads said that section one was to be completed by February 2008, but by that time completion had been pushed out to the middle of 2008. By this time earth works were completed on stage two, with 700,000 cubic metres of earth moved, and installation of noise walls had started along with landscaping.\n\nBy May 2008 completion of stages one and two of the road has been delayed until November, with VicRoads staying that \"\"wet and cold weather in recent weeks had prevented sealing the road surface\"\". At this time the Victorian Government permitted the filming of a plane crash scene from the Nicolas Cage film \"Knowing\" on the incomplete road at Corio.\n\nLocal police expressed concerns about a staged opening of the road, with drivers using temporary shortcuts not suited to heavy traffic and large vehicles.\n\nConstruction on sections 1 and 2 reached practical completion when the road opened to traffic on 14 December 2008.\n\nSection 3\n\nThe $108.3 million design and construction contract for section 3 was awarded on 25 July 2007 to Abigroup. Section three works include 7.5 kilometres of freeway, the transportation of 4.7 million cubic metres of earth, and twin 110-metre long bridges over the Barwon River. Construction of section 3 commenced on 14 September 2007.\n\nBy February 2008 550,000 cubic metres of earth had been moved to the north and south of Barrabool Road, and the foundation works for the arch structure over Wandana Drive were complete. Section three was originally scheduled for completion in the second half of 2009 however it was announced in early June 2009 that section three would open 6 months early on 14 June 2009.\n\nSection 4A\n\nThe design and construction contract for section 4A was awarded to Fulton Hogan on 16 December 2008 for $61.7 million. Construction began in March 2009 and was completed by the end of 2011.\n\nSection one from Corio to the Midland Highway at Bell Post Hill, and section two from the Midland Highway to the Hamilton Highway at Fyansford were officially opened on Sunday, 14 December 2008. Two days of torrential rain beforehand threatened to disrupt the opening, however it went ahead as planned after a cessation of the storm. Section three, from the Hamilton Highway to the Princes Highway at Waurn Ponds was opened in June 2009. These first two sections were opened by Victorian Premier John Brumby, who announced the naming of the feature bridge on stage two of the road as the \"Lewis Bandt Bridge\", in honour of the Ford Australia engineer who is credited as the inventor of the Utility vehicle, in Geelong.\n\nSection 3 opened on 14 June 2009.\n\nSection 4A opened in December 2011\n\nSection 4B opened in February 2013.\n\nThe freeway saves fuel and travel time for commuters and cargo trucks.\n\nThe completion of the Geelong Ring Road was expected to bring large economic benefits to the region. Approximately 582 hectares of land west of the road has been identified for use as new industrial land, however resistance from nearby residents in the Lovely Banks area to two service station developments cast some cloud over future development.\n\nSome opponents of the construction of the Geelong Ring Road feared that the inclusion of the road in the local Geelong roads ecosystem would have adversely affected the environmental conditions in the Geelong area. One point made was that it would \"generate millions of tons of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide pollution in the Geelong and Corio Bay region\".\n\nMore likely however is that the overall difference would not be significant, as traffic that would previously have travelled through the centre of Geelong via the main Melbourne Road/Latrobe Terrace/James Harrison Bridge/Settlement Road/High Street/Princes Highway West corridor, would now travel via the Geelong Ring Road, improving the environmental condition for the majority of Geelong residents, by removing that traffic from the most heavily populated areas of the city. There has been no environmental study that shows that the construction of the Geelong Ring Road would adversely affect the environment.\n\nThe loss of amenity experienced by residents in the immediate vicinity of the freeway corridor due to the severing of a number of local roads was also a source of criticism, but most of these roads have been reconnected via upgraded existing roads, or the addition of new roads.\n\nThe main opposition to this project had nothing to do with environmental issues. In 1991 VicRoads undertook its own study and decided to abandon plans to utilise the Section 3 route in favour of a bypass from Avalon Road across Corio Bay to Point Henry and then along the Barwon River valley to the Surf Coast Highway, Anglesea Road and Princes Highway West.\n\nAs a result of VicRoads decision the freeway reservation south of Princes Highway West to the Anglesea Road was abandoned and was developed as residential allotments with the approval of VicRoads and South Barwon Council.\n\nOver the next 11 years many people built houses along the route especially from Wandana Drive to the Princes Highway West. Then in 2001 the Victorian Government initiated a project to investigate options for a Geelong Bypass. It involved a steering committee, technical committee and Community consultation committee. After 18 months the expectations based on information provided to participants was that the VicRoads preferred route would be recommended. To the surprise of almost all Westconnect - the route to the west of Geelong including the abandoned Section 3 was recommended. Much later it was found that someone had re-costed the eastern route as a full 2 lanes each way freeway construction - even though such a construction was not warranted - and that re-costing made the eastern route uneconomic.\n\nImmediately opposition was generated by those who had built close to the Ring Road reservation. VicRoads proposes 4 alternate routes with the result that further opposition was generated from people located close to Options 2 and 3.\n\nIn May 2005 during negotiations between Planning Panels Victoria and VicRoads over an environmental Effects process, Planning Panels requested VicRoads minimise the Options to be considered. VicRoads obliged by reducing the Options to 1 and 2 , even though Option 3 was the best Option . As a result, during the EES process a huge amount of pressure was put on the Planning Panel in respect of consideration of Option 3 but they only agreed to consider it if neither 1 or 2 satisfied the criteria being considered.\nIn its recommendation, in spite of neither Option 1 or 2 satisfying the criteria . Planning Panels recommended Option 1 plus an urgent need to consider further work to overcome the problems with Option 1 including the fact it ended in the middle of a commercial area with nowhere to go to connect to Anglesea Road et cetera.\n\nAs a result, the estimated cost of the route to Anglesea Road and then around to Princes Highway West is $618 million - about $200 million more than Option 3 plus a connection to Anglesea Road would have cost. In addition the fact that the route is 3 km longer than Option 1, that most freight traffic comes from the west, and the route requires trucks to negotiate slopes down into the Waurn Ponds Valley and then back out again means the additional cost to users is around $10 million per annum. Finally around 360 households are located within 160 metres of the Ring Road and subject to noise and diesel engine particulate matter pollution whereas with the Option 3 route only 10 houses would have been within 160 metres.\n\nThe freeway is entirely located in the local government area of City of Greater Geelong.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051863", "title": "Welfare definition of economics", "text": "Welfare definition of economics\n\nThe \"welfare definition\" of economics is an attempt by Alfred Marshall, a pioneer neoclassical economist, to redefine his field of study. This definition expands the field of economic science to a larger study of humanity. Specifically, Marshall's view is that economics studies all the actions that people take in order to achieve economic welfare. In the words of Marshall, \"man earns money to get material welfare.\" This is why economists since Marshall have described his definition as the \"welfare definition\" of economics. This definition enlarged the scope of economic science by emphasizing the study of wealth and humanity together, rather than wealth alone.\n\nIn his widely read textbook, \"Principles of Economics\", published in 1890, Marshall defines economics as follows:\n\n\"Political Economy or Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being\".\n\nThe following are the implications of this definition:\n\nAccording to Edwin Cannan, \"the aim of political economy or Economics is the explanation of the general causes on which the material welfare of human beings depend\".\n\nMarshall clearly explains that economic activity is different from other activity. For example,\n\nMarshall defines economic activity as separate from the above activities. A farmer who toils in the field, or a worker on an assembly, are performing an economic activity: they work to increase their material welfare (primarily by earning money). Money buys goods or services that satisfy wants. In other words, economics deals with effort, wants, and the satisfaction of those wants.\n\nFollowers in the neoclassical tradition, such as William Beveridge and Arthur Pigou have continued to define economics in terms of material economic welfare. According to Pigou, \"the range of enquiry becomes restricted to that part of social welfare that can be brought directly or indirectly into relation with the measuring rod of money\".\n\nMarshall’s definition has been criticized by more recent economists, including Lionel Robbins. Robbins' criticisms include:\n\n(1) Narrows down the scope of economics. Marshall distinguishes between material and non-material welfare, and confines economics to the study of material welfare. Robbins feels that economists should not limit their attention to material welfare. There are things that are \"non-material\" but they promote human welfare. Robbins cites “the services of doctors, lawyers, teachers, dancers, engineers, professors\". These goods \"satisfy our wants and are scarce in supply”. Some economists feel that Marshall's definition of \"material\" includes both goods and services, and that Robbins is either misreading Marshall's text, or creating a straw man argument.\n\n(2) Assumes equivalency between welfare and economic activity. For Robbins, there are economic activities which do not promote human welfare. For example, the sale of cocaine or heroin. Here Robbins says, “Why talk of welfare at all? Why not throw away the mask altogether”.\n\n(3) It is a vague concept. According to Robbins, “welfare” is a vague concept to use to define economics because it is subjective. Economics is a quantitative science; but welfare cannot be quantitatively measured, and two persons cannot agree on what creates or improves welfare.\n\n(4) It involves value judgement. Finally the word “welfare” in Marshall’s definition brings economics to the realm of ethics. Robbins would prefer that economics remain neutral in assessing the results of economic transactions..\n\nBroadly, economic welfare is the level of prosperity and standard of living of either an individual or a group of persons. In the field of economics, it specifically refers to utility gained through the achievement of material goods and services. In other words, it refers to that part of social welfare that can be fulfilled through economic activity.\n\nAccording to Roefie Hueting, welfare is dependent on factors like employment, income distribution, labour conditions, leisure time, production and the scarce possible uses of the environmental functions.\n\nEconomic welfare is measured in different ways, depending on the preferences of those measuring it. Factors used to measure the economic welfare of a population, include: GDP, literacy, access to health care, and assessments of environmental quality.\n\n"}

Burbank left the show in mid-December 2007 in order to spend more time with his daughter in Seattle. His last appearance on the program was on December 14, 2007.\n\nAfter leaving NPR, Burbank returned to Seattle to host a local show called \"Too Beautiful to Live\". The program ran for 18 months (initially on KIRO-AM and then on KIRO-FM). It was \"Seattle Weekly\"'s choice as \"Best Radio Talk Show\" in July 2009, but after a poor showing in the July Arbitron ratings, the radio program was canceled in September. Burbank and KIRO said that the program would continue as a daily podcast. The podcast has continued since its radio cancellation, currently on American Public Media with longest serving co-host Andrew Walsh, a veteran radio producer and sometime host in his own right.\n\nOn October 26, 2010, after one year off the KIRO airwaves, Burbank joined \"The Dave Ross Show\" as co-host. The show was renamed to \"The Ross and Burbank Show\". On January 7, 2013, the show was involved in a KIRO morning lineup change. Ross anchored Seattle's Morning News from 6 to 9 a.m., then co-hosted \"The Ross and Burbank Show\" from 9-10 a.m. Burbank hosted The Luke Burbank Show from 10 a.m. to 12 noon. with co-host Tom Tangney. On August 2, 2013, Burbank announced that he was leaving both shows to pursue longer-form broadcast opportunities.\n\nOn March 11, 2013, Burbank became the interim host for the syndicated public radio variety show \"Live Wire Radio\". In September of that year he became the full-time host.\n\nHe previously appeared in a regular weekly segment called \"Awesome, Not Awesome\" on the Madeleine Brand show on KPCC until its cancellation in September 2012.\n\nIn September 2013 he starred in a Microsoft online video advertisement with his wife Carey Burbank, which made headlines after it was pulled by the company less than 24 hours later following viewer backlash. The Huffington Post declared the ad was \"terrible\" while The Next Web described it as \"cringeworthy.\" Burbank defended the ad, however, saying it was \"successful.\"\n\n"}

The petroglyph sites are much more plentiful than the rock painting sites. The prehistoric art of this area is not as well known as the more popular rock carving sites of Scandinavia, such as the Rock carvings at Alta, the Nämforsen rock art site, or the many petroglyph sites in Bohuslän, Sweden - but in recent years the amount of research into this corpus has increased, due largely to the work of professor Kalle Sognnes at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim.\n\nScandinavian rock art comprise two categories. The first type dates to the Stone Age (in Norway from between 8000-1800 BC), and usually depicts mammals such as elk, red deer and reindeer, but also brown bears, whales and porpoises. It also depicts fish such as halibut and salmon, as well as birds. There are also examples of boats, humans and various geometrical figures. These rock carvings were probably made by people who used gathering, fishing and hunting as their subsistence. This type of rock art is commonly known as veideristninger (hunter's rock carvings). Since the most common motifs are hunted animals, a popular interpretation has been that the carvings were made as part of \"hunter's magic\" - in an attempt to gain control of the animals that were hunted.\n\nIn the later years, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the animals being totems for clans or the animals being spiritual animals seen in trance. Some sites with paintings in this style are also known.\n\nIn addition to the carved sites dating from the Stone Age, there is a series of caves on the coast of Central Norway containing painted human stick figures. As has been shown by archaeologist Hein Bjerck, these pictures are usually located in the liminal area of the cave where the natural light gives way to complete darkness. He has suggested that these pictures were part of initiation rites.\n\nThe second kind of Scandinavian rock art was made by farmers, usually in the Nordic Bronze Age, the Pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age (In Norway approx. 1800 BC until AD 400). The most common motifs are the cup mark (cupule), boats, horses, people (often brandishing weapons), foot soles, wagons, and many kinds of abstract geometrical symbols (such as spirals, concentric circles etc.) Interpretations of this kind of art has usually been that of a fertility cult, with the ship being a mythical ship that is sometimes seen pulling abstract representations of the sun. Danish archaeologist Flemming Kaul has attempted to recreate a complete Bronze Age cosmology by examining illustrations on Danish bronze items. He suggests that the ships and horses seen in the carvings and on the bronze items were the sun's helpers - the horse pulling the sun across the sky during the day, and the boat bringing it back through the underworld during night-time.\n\nThe hunter's rock carvings are often found in places with striking and highly visible natural features, such as below steep cliffs, by waterfalls etc. This was part of what led to the original hunting-magic-interpretation: supposedly the carvings were made in places where animals could easily be hunted. In Central Norway, these sites have a markedly different distribution than the Bronze Age carvings. Sites are found one by one, often in isolated places.\n\nThe Bronze Age-sites, on the other hand, are usually clustered. They are often found in places with arable land that could have been used for fields and grazing, and were probably quite close to the original settlements and farms. In Central Norway there are concentrations of these carvings mainly in the Stjørdal municipality, in the Steinkjer area, around the Selbu lake, and in the Melhus area. Certain solitary sites also exists.\n\nMost of the rock-art sites in Central Norway, and indeed in Scandinavia as a whole, are not meant to be visited by the public. There are no signs, no maintenance is done on the sites to keep vegetation from covering the carvings, etc. There are however a small number of sites open to the public. These have signs with information, the carvings are usually painted to make them more visible, and there are parking spaces.\n\nThis site is of the Stone Age type, located approximately 30 kilometres from Steinkjer, Nord-Trøndelag. The first figure to be discovered was a naturalistic reindeer, almost life size. The placement in the landscape is striking: close to a waterfall that becomes quite large during flood season. The site was discovered in 1895, as one of the first sites of the Stone Age type in Norway. In recent years, more figures have been discovered: a bear, a person on skis, an elk, and several parts of other figures. The carvings are thought to be up to 5500 years old.\n\nThe Bardal site is also in the Steinkjer area. The site is particularly interesting as it contains images from both of the rock carving traditions. There is a multitude of different motifs: boats, elks, people, abstract geometrical figures, horses, and a six meter long whale. The earliest carvings probably date to 6000-5500 BC, while the later ones are from the period 1500-200 BC.\n\nThis site on the Frosta peninsula is also from the Stone Age tradition. Motifs ranges from whales, elks, boats and people. A concentration of cup marks were probably made later, perhaps during the Bronze Age.\n\nDespite its uninviting name (meaning \"rock shelter\" or \"cliff overhang\" in Norwegian), this is a beautiful site, located near Stjørdal. It contains two large reindeer, other, smaller reindeer and an intricate, geometrical pattern. These figures could be up to 6000 years old.\n\nThis is the only public site in Central Norway with only Bronze Age carvings. It lies in the centre of Stjørdal, and because of its size, might have been a ritual centre during the Bronze Age. The site is unusual in the number of figures (more than a thousand), and must have been used in several periods from about 1500 BC until a few hundred years AD.\n\nThis site lies in Stadsbygd on the Fosen peninsula, and can be reached by ferry from Trondheim. It dates to the Stone Age. On an almost vertical, undulating cliff face three near life size elks have been carved. In addition there is another animal which might represent a hare.\n\n\n\n"}

These demonstrations can be seen as the forerunner of the anti-globalisation protests of the 1990s, especially those in London, England, on May Day and the Carnival against Capitalism on 18 June 1999. They were partially inspired by the actions of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp.\n\nActivities that formed part of the biggest of these events were separate day-long street blockades of the financial district (the City of London) which supporters of the protest argued are a major centre for profiteering, and consequently a root cause of many of the world's problems. The largest blockade involved 3,000 people, which succeeded in causing a £100 million shortfall on the day according to \"The Times\". Around 1,000 arrests were subsequently made by the police over 18 months.\n\nThere were several inspirations for the protest. At the time there was a growing anti-militarist and anti-nuclear movement across Europe represented in the UK by CND and the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, which repeatedly blockaded the RAF Greenham Common base in protest at nuclear weapons being placed there. A new generation of anarchists were being drawn into activism through anarcho-punk.\n\nOn 29 September 1983, 1500 people demonstrated in order to disrupt the financial activities of the City of London. Buildings were blockaded and leaflets handed out.\n\nThe protest was unusual for the time since it had not met with the police to discuss a route or stewarding, it was not organised by a political party or trade union and the plan was not to march from one point to another.\n\nAfterwards, Penny Rimbaud of Crass declared it “a massive success, the best gig of the year.\" Rimbaud listed the following actions: work stopped at the Royal Exchange, shops selling fur attacked, restaurants stink-bombed, building locks glued, telephone lines jammed.\n\nAround 200 arrestees faced charges, with the court dates set for November 1983. Solidarity days were organised with the theme 'Actions against Banks.'\n\nThe second demonstration was planned by anarchists meeting at the squatted ambulance station on Old Kent Road in south London. The squat also organised a benefit gig which raised £300 and featured Flux of Pink Indians, Kukl and Flowers in the Dustbin.\nThe rough plan for the day was as follows:\n\nThe demonstration happened on 29 March 1984. In addition to the events stated above there were feminist actions such as the mass theft of tampons from Boots the chemists, animal rights protests against fur and alternative energy protests outside the Central Electricity Generating Board. In total, 550 police officers were deployed and there were around 400 arrests. Writing in \"The Times\" a correspondent described \"a combination of punks, anarchists, nuclear disarmers, and people demanding the liberation of gays, women or animals.\"\n\nAt an evaluation conference attended by around 65 people on 14–15 April it was decided to do another Stop the City in September 1984 and also to do a short-notice event in May. The 31 May Stop the City was swamped by police and viewed by organisers as a failure. It was acknowledged that more publicity was needed.\n\nThe fourth Stop the City took place on 27 September 1984, with benefit gigs happening at the Dickie Dirts squat in Coldharbour Lane in Brixton, south London. St. Pauls Cathedral and the Royal Exchange were sealed off against demonstrators. A 'people's party' was held in a bank and banners were hung up. A counter group handed out leaflets urging city workers to 'aggravate an anarchist.' The water in the Trafalgar Square fountains was dyed red and there was an impromptu anti-apartheid demonstration on Oxford Street. The police tactic was again to swamp the protests. Of the 470 arrests, most were released again swiftly.\n\nPenny Rimbaud wrote that \"Aware that we had been out-manoeuvred, no further Stop the City actions took place in London.\"\n\nBefore the second Stop the City in London in 1984, there were also smaller demonstrations attacking banks in Bristol and Glasgow one week earlier.\n\nFollowing the fourth Stop the City event in London, there were other demonstrations across the UK, including Birmingham. In Leeds, on 9 August 1984, activists including members of Chumbawamba chained up the doors of a porn cinema, threw Monopoly money onto shoppers, gave out leaflets and ran a pirate radio station which blocked wavelengths used by BBC radio stations.\n\nStop the City was criticised by the Anarchist Workers Group for creating an anarchist ghetto politics.\n\nWhilst seen as initially successful, the demonstrations also provoked questions for anarcho-punk activists about how to make alliances with other groups and what aims to strive for in future. It was clear that the numbers of people on Stop the City protests were nothing like the 400,000 people attending the CND rally at Hyde Park in 1983.\n\nAn hour-long documentary was made about the second Stop the City event by members of Crass Mick Duffield (camera), Joy de Vivre (sound) and Andy Palmer (interviewer).\n\n\n"}

He was named after his uncle, a victim of the Irish Civil War in the early 1920s. Lemass was educated at Catholic University School, Leeson Street in Dublin and later at Newbridge College in County Kildare. He didn't attend university, against his father's wishes, instead undertaking business training and later becoming an executive member and branch secretary of the Irish Commercial Traveller's Association.\n\nLemass followed his father into politics in 1955, when he was elected to Dublin City Council.

It is located on Adelsö island (formerly called Alsnö), of Lake Mälaren in central-eastern Sweden. The ruins are part of the combined Birka and Hovgården UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe ruin is next to five burial mounds, up to 45m in diameter, which date back to the Vendel Era (i.e. Late Iron Age, c. 500-800 CE) when Hovgården was a so-called King's House (\"Kungsgård\"). The royal castle \"Alsnö hus\" reflects the importance of Birka, the trade settlement on Björkö island just south of Adelsö. However, Birka was abandoned around 975, but apparently the royal mansion continued to be of importance as the runestone U 11 (c. 1070 CE) was erected next to it.\n\"Alsnö hus\" first appears in historical records in 1200 as \"mansionem regiam Alsnu\", i.e. a house of more than ordinary proportions. However, 70 years later King Magnus Barnlock had the old fortress replaced by a summer residence built in brick. In contrast to the many fortifications built during the era, this building was a summer residence more adapted to offer comfort than defence and it regularly served both Magnus and his son Birger during summers. The Ordinance of Alsnö (\"Alsnö stadga\") was made here in 1279, often said to be the foundation of the Swedish nobility as a separate social class and the start the Swedish feudal system. Large parts of the Romanesque parish church Adelsö Church next to the present ruins date from this period and was possibly commissioned by the king.\n\nThe building was ruined by the end of the 14th century, and little remains today. When the ruins were excavated in 1916-18, a huge number of crossbow bolts were found, indicating the palace might have been burnt down by the pirates of Albert von Mecklenburg who raided the Baltic in an attempt to reclaim the Swedish crown to Albert.\n\nThe ruins were bought by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities (\"Vitterhetsakademien\") in the 1950s and 1960s and are today preserved by the Swedish National Heritage Board (\"Riksantikvarieämbetet\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2051939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051939", "title": "Wisteria frutescens", "text": "Wisteria frutescens\n\nWisteria frutescens, commonly known as American wisteria, is a woody, deciduous, perennial climbing vine, one of various wisterias of the family Fabaceae. It is native to the wet forests and stream banks of the southeastern United States, with a range stretching from the states of Virginia to Texas (Northeast Texas Piney Woods) and extending southeast through Florida, also north to Iowa, Michigan, and New York.\n\nCarl Linnaeus described \"Wisteria frutescens\".\n\nKentucky wisteria, \"Wisteria frutescens\" var. \"macrostachya\" is a distinctive variety found in the southeastern United States, including its namesake state of Kentucky. It has been classified as a separate species, \"Wisteria macrostachya\" .\n\nAmerican wisteria can grow up to 15 m long over many supports via powerful clockwise-twining stems. It produces dense clusters of blue-purple, two-lipped, flowers wide on racemes long in late spring to early summer. These are the smallest racemes produced by any \"Wisteria\". Though it has never been favored in many gardens for this characteristic, many bonsai artists employ American wisteria for its manageably-sized flowers, and it is charming as a woodland flowering vine.\n\nThe foliage consists of shiny, dark-green, pinnately compound leaves in length. The leaves bear 9-15 oblong leaflets that are each long. It also bears numerous poisonous, bean-like seed pods long that mature in summer and persist until winter; the pods are fuzzy and greenish-tan when young, but shiny brown and smooth when dry. The seeds are large and brown (see image). American wisteria prefers moist soils. It is considered shade tolerant, but will flower only when exposed to partial or full sun. It grows best in USDA plant hardiness zones 5-9.\n\nKentucky wisteria bears unscented bluish-purple flowers in racemes long, a generally average length for the \"Wisteria\" family.\n\nSeveral characteristics distinguish American wisteria from its Asian counterparts. It grows only two-thirds as tall, its racemes are half as long (the shortest of the wisteria family), and its bloom time is sometimes shorter than many Asian varieties. Its flowers are not scented, and its seed pods are smooth rather than velvety when mature. Its most redeeming feature is the fact that it is much less invasive than its Asian counterparts, especially the beautiful but ruthless Chinese wisteria (\"Wisteria sinensis\").\n\nAmerican wisteria is very similar to Kentucky wisteria (\"Wisteria macrostachya\") which has been considered a variety of \"W. frutescens\" but grows somewhat differently and has a fragrance.\n\nThe butterflies long-tailed skipper, silver-spotted skipper, marine blue, zarucco duskywing and the moth \"Cuphodes wisteriae\" use \"Wisteria frutescens\" as a larval host.\n\n\"Wisteria frutescens\", in general, is subject to few pests or diseases. It is, however, subject to damage by typical pests like aphids, leaf miners, Japanese beetles, scale insects, and mealybugs. Pests of particular concern are longhorn beetles, such as \"Synaphaeta guexi\", and the Asian long-horned beetle. These beetles will bore into the woody stems of young or unhealthy wisteria, causing disruption of water and nutrient flow. This also allows for the potential to introduce disease, like rot, and both of these have the potential to cause death of the plant.\n\n\"Aplosporella wistariae\" , previously known as \"Haplosporella wistariae\" , has been found on some cultivars of wisteria in Louisville, Kansas. Its stromata are elliptical or orbicular, are 1–2 mm in diameter, and are sunk into the bark, which causes raised pustules, some of which are ruptured. Its perithecia are 120-150 μm and are white inside; sporules are oblong, measuring 12-16 by 6-7 μm.\n\nPartly dead leaves of \"Wisteria frutescens\" have been found to host \"Phomatospora wistariae\" This fungus is perithecial, meaning its fruiting body is flask-shaped with an ostiole through which its ascospores are released. It is mostly epiphytic, and it grows in relatively flat gray spots that are approximately 2–4 mm. in diameter. These spots are bounded by narrow dark lines; however, they frequently run together. \"Phomatospora wistariae\" is hyaline in appearance and resembles a membrane, it is sessile, it does not have paraphyses, its asci are oblong, and its sporidia are biseriate and have an oblong-elliptical shape. Its perithecia mesaure to about 110-120 μm, its asci 35-45 by 10-12 μm, and its sporidia 12 by 6 μm.\n\n\"Rhizobium radiobacter\", previously known as \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" and commonly as crown gall, is a soil-borne bacterium that occasionally infects wisteria, causing abnormal growths or swellings on the roots or stems. It infects the plant through its Ti plasmid, and then \"A. tumefaciens\" integrates a part of its DNA into the chromosome of the host plant's cells. The K-48 strain of the bacterium can be effectively used to prevent infection by the pathogenic strain of Crown Gall.\n\nRoot-knot nematodes are parasites known to affect most species of plants, wisteria not being an exception, but wisteria is susceptible to Texas root rot caused by the fungus \"Phymatotrichum omnivorum\". Texas root rot damages the roots and prevents their absorption of water, resulting in wilting then death.\n\n\"Pantoea agglomerans\" has been shown to induce galls on \"Wisteria\".\n\n\"Wisteria brachybotrys\", \"Wisteria floribunda\", \"Wisteria sinensis\" and \"Wisteria venusta\", have been shown to carry \"Erysiphe cichoracearum,\" \"Botryosphaeria,\" and \"Phomopsis\" canker and die-back pathogens, \"Phyllosticta wisteriae\", and \"Septoria wisteriae\". Wisteria vein mosaic virus (a variant of the tobacco mosaic virus) and subterranean clover stunt virus are the only two known viruses to infect genus \"Wisteria\", and the potential for \"Wisteria frutescens\" to contract any of the previously mentioned diseases is indeterminate.\n\nAll species of \"Wisteria\" contain a saponin known as Wisterin, sometimes called Wistarin, in the bark, branches, pods, roots, and seeds. There is debate over whether the flowers are toxic. An unknown and toxic resin is present as well. Poisoning from the plant can occur from ingestion of 1 to 2 seed pods and results in mild to severe gastroenteritis, nausea, frequent vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. This can result in dehydration and collapse in serious cases; recovery generally occurs within 24 hours. The concentration of toxins varies in all segments of the plant and varies during different seasons. Wisterin's structure has been shown to be similar in structure and in effects to the alkaloid cytisine, but less potent. It has a bittersweet taste. As with the cytisine containing \"Laburnum\", its leaves are sometimes taken as a tobacco substitute.\n\nCanavanine is a common α-amino-acid constituent found in the seeds of all species of \"Wisteria\". It serves as a defense compound against herbivores and provides a vital source of nitrogen for the growing plant embryo. The toxicity of canavanine is due to its extreme structural similarity to L-arginine, which may result in an organism's incorporation of it into proteins in place of L-arginine. This causes aberrant proteins that may not function properly.\n\n"}

The term is usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and the technique is very characteristic of scripting languages.\n\nIn a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results. The name \"read–eval–print loop\" comes from the names of the Lisp primitive functions which implement this functionality:\n\n\nThe development environment then returns to the read state, creating a loop, which terminates when the program is closed.\n\nREPLs facilitate exploratory programming and debugging because the programmer can inspect the printed result before deciding what expression to provide for the next read. The read–eval–print loop involves the programmer more frequently than the classic edit-compile-run-debug cycle.\n\nBecause the \"print\" function outputs in the same textual format that the \"read\" function uses for input, most results are printed in a form that could (if it is useful) be copied and pasted back into the REPL. However, it's sometimes necessary to print representations of elements that can't sensibly be read back in, such as a socket handle or a complex class instance. In these cases, there must exist a syntax for unreadable objects. In Python, it is the codice_5 notation, and in Common Lisp, the codice_6 form. The REPL of CLIM, SLIME, and the Symbolics Lisp Machine can also read back unreadable objects. They record for each output which object was printed. Later when the code is read back, the object will be retrieved from the printed output.\n\nREPLs can be created to support any text-based language. REPL support for compiled languages is usually achieved by implementing an interpreter on top of a virtual machine which provides an interface to the compiler. For example, starting with JDK 9, Java included JShell as a command line interface to the language. Various other languages have third party tools available for download that provide similar shell interaction with the language.\n\nAs a shell, a REPL environment allows users to access relevant features of an operating system in addition to providing access to programming capabilities.\n\nThe most common use for REPLs outside of operating system shells is for instantaneous prototyping. Other uses include mathematical calculation, creating documents that integrate scientific analysis (e.g. IPython), interactive software maintenance, benchmarking, and algorithm exploration.\n\nA REPL can become an essential part of learning a new language as it gives quick feedback to the novice.\n\nMinimal definition is: \n\nWhere codice_7 represents initial codice_8-uation Environment. It is also assumed that codice_7 can be destructively updated by codice_8.\n\nTypical functionality provided by a Lisp REPL includes:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2051965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051965", "title": "Prithviraj Chauhan", "text": "Prithviraj Chauhan\n\nPrithviraja III (IAST: Pṛthvī-rāja; reign. –1192 CE ), popularly known as Prithviraj Chauhan or Rai Pithora was a king from the Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty. He ruled Sapadalaksha, the traditional Chahamana territory, in present-day north-western India. He controlled much of the present-day Rajasthan, Haryana, and Delhi; and some parts of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. His capital was located at Ajayameru (modern Ajmer), although the medieval folk legends describe him as the king of India's political centre Delhi to portray him as a representative of the pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nEarly in his career, Prithviraj achieved military successes against several neighbouring Hindu kingdoms, most notably against the Chandela king Paramardi. He also repulsed the early invasions by Muhammad of Ghor, a ruler of the Muslim Ghurid dynasty. However, in 1192 CE, the Ghurids defeated Prithviraj at the Second battle of Tarain, and executed him shortly after. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the Islamic conquest of India, and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts. The most popular of these accounts is \"Prithviraj Raso\", which presents him as a \"Rajput\", although the Rajput identity did not exist during his time.\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number, and were not issued by the king himself. Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles. Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval \"kavya\"s (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors. These include \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", \"Hammira Mahakavya\" and \"Prithviraj Raso\". These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable. \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj. \"Prithviraj Raso\", which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by the king's court poet Chand Bardai. However, it is full of exaggerated accounts many of which are worthless for the purposes of history.\n\nOther chronicles and texts that mention Prithviraj include \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", \"Prabandha Kosha\" and \"Prithviraja Prabandha\". These were composed centuries after his death, and contain exaggerations and anachronistic anecdotes. Prithviraj has also been mentioned in \"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\", a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara Jain monks. While the work was completed in 1336 CE, the part that mentions Prithviraj was written around 1250 CE. The \"Alha-Khanda\" (or \"Alha Raso\") of the Chandela poet Jaganika also provides an exaggerated account of Prithviraj's war against the Chandelas.\n\nSome other Indian texts also mention Prithviraj, but do not provide much information of historical value. For example, the Sanskrit poem anthology \"Sharngadhara-paddhati\" (1363) contains a verse praising him, and the \"Kanhadade Prabandha\" (1455) mentions him as an earlier incarnation of the Jalore Chahamana king Viramade.\n\nPrithviraj was born to the Chahamana king Someshvara and queen Karpuradevi (a Kalachuri princess). Both Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chaulukya court by his maternal relatives. According to \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the Jyeshtha month. The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the astrological planetary positions at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, Dasharatha Sharma calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 VS).\n\nThe medieval biographies of Prithviraj suggest that he was educated well. The \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" states that he mastered 6 languages; the \"Prithviraj Raso\" claims that he learned 14 languages, which appears to be an exaggeration. The \"Raso\" goes on to claim that he became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy (mimamsa), and theology. Both the texts state that he was particularly proficient in archery.\n\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II. Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent. The \"Hammira Mahakavya\" claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then retired to the forest. However, this is doubtful.\n\nDuring his early years as the king, Prithviraj's mother managed the administration, assisted by a regency council.\n\nKadambavasa served as the chief minister of the kingdom during this period. He is also known as Kaimasa, Kaimash or Kaimbasa in the folk legends, which describe him as an able administrator and soldier devoted to the young king. \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" states that he was responsible for all the military victories during the early years of Prithviraj's reign. According to two different legends, Kadambavasa was later killed by Prithviraj. The \"Prithviraja-Raso\" claims that Prithviraj killed the minister after finding him in the apartment of the king's favourite concubine Karnati. \"Prithviraja-Prabandha\" claims that a man named Pratapa-Simha conspired against the minister, and convinced Prithviraj that the minister was responsible for the repeated Muslim invasions. Both these claims appear to be historically inaccurate, as the much more historically reliable \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" does not mention any such incident.\n\nBhuvanaikamalla, the paternal uncle of Prithviraj's mother, was another important minister during this time. According to \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", he was a valiant general who served Prithviraj as Garuda serves Vishnu. The text also states that he was \"proficient in the art of subduing \"nāga\"s\". According to the 15th-century historian Jonaraja, \"naga\" here refers to elephants. However, Har Bilas Sarda interpreted Naga as the name of a tribe, and theorized that Bhuvanaikamalla defeated this tribe.\n\nAccording to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Prithviraj assumed actual control of the administration in 1180 CE (1237 VS).\n\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Guḍapura; possibly modern Gurgaon). Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle Vigraharaja IV, and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.\n\nAccording to \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", Nagarjuna rebelled against Prithviraj's authority and occupied the fort of Gudapura. Prithviraj besieged Gudapura with a large army comprising infantry, camels, elephants and horses. Nagarjuna fled the fort, but Devabhata (possibly his general) continued to offer resistance. Ultimately, Prithviraj's army emerged victorious, and captured the wife, mother, and followers of Nagarjuna. According to \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", a garland made of the defeated soldiers' heads was hung across the Ajmer fort gate.\n\nTwo verses of \"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\" mention the victory of Prithviraj over the Bhadanakas, while describing a debate between two Jain monks. This victory can be dated to sometime before 1182 CE, when the said debate took place.\n\nAccording to Cynthia Talbot, the Bhadanakas were an obscure dynasty who controlled the area around Bayana. According to Dasharatha Sharma, the Bhadanaka territory comprised the area around present-day Bhiwani, Rewari and Alwar.\n\nThe 1182–83 CE (1239 VS) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day Bundelkhand), which was ruled by the Chandela king Paramardi. Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as \"Prithviraj Raso\", \"Paramal Raso\", and \"Alha-Raso\". Other texts such as \"Sarangadhara Paddhati\" and \"Prabandha Chintamani\" also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi. The \"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\" mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a \"digvijaya\" (conquest of all the regions). This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti.\n\nThe legendary account of Prithviraj's campaign against the Chandelas goes like this: Prithviraj was returning to Delhi after marrying the daughter of Padamsen, when his contingent was attacked by the \"Turkic\" forces (Ghurids). His army repulsed the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. Amid this chaos, the Chahamana soldiers lost their way, and unknowingly encamped in the Chandela capital Mahoba. They killed the Chandela royal gardener for objecting to their presence, which led to a skirmish between the two sides. The Chandela king Paramardi asked his general Udal to attack Prithviraj's camp, but Udal advised against this move. Paramardi's brother-in-law Mahil Parihar ruled modern-day Orai; he harboured ill-will against Paramardi, and instigated the king to go ahead with the attack. Prithviraj defeated Udal's contingent, and then left for Delhi. Subsequently, unhappy with Mahil's scheming, Udal and his brother Alha left the Chandela court. They started serving Jaichand, the Gahadavala ruler of Kannauj. Mahil then secretly informed Prithviraj that Chandela kingdom had become weak in absence of its strongest generals. Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom, and besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Udal's cousin Malkhan. After failing to win over Malkhan through peaceful methods and losing eight generals, Prithviraj captured the fort. The Chandelas then appealed for a truce, and used this time to recall Alha and Udal from Kannauj. In support of the Chandelas, Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons. The combined Chandela-Gahadavala army attacked Prithviraj's camp, but was defeated. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked Mahoba. He then dispatched his general Chavand Rai to Kalinjar Fort to capture Paramardi. According to the various legends, Paramardi either died or retired shortly after the attack. Prithviraj returned to Delhi after appointing Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son recaptured Mahoba.\n\nThe exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable. The Madanpur inscriptions establish that Prithviraj sacked Mahoba, but historical evidence indicates that he did not occupy Mahoba or Kalinjar. It is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory; in fact, he continued ruling as a sovereign nearly a decade after Prithviraj's death. It appears that Prithviraj only raided Jejakabhukti, and Paramardi regained control of his kingdom soon after his departure from Mahoba. Prithviraj was not able to annex the Chandela territory to his kingdom.\n\nThe \"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\" mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and Bhima II, the Chaulukya (Solanki) king of Gujarat. This implies that the two kings were previously at war. This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 VS). The Veraval inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals). Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.\n\nThe historically unreliable \"Prithviraj Raso\" provides some details about the Chahamana-Chaulukya struggle. According to it, both Prithviraj and Bhima wanted to marry Ichchhini, the Paramara princess of Abu. Prithviraj's marriage to her led to a rivalry between the two kings. Historian G. H. Ojha dismisses this legend as fiction, because it states that Ichchhini was a daughter of Salakha, while Dharavarsha was the Paramara ruler of Abu at the time. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, believes that Salakha was the head of another Paramara branch at Abu. The \"Raso\" also mentions that Prithviraj's uncle Kanhadeva had killed seven sons of Bhima's uncle Sarangadeva. To avenge these murders, Bhima invaded the Chahamana kingdom and killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara, capturing Nagor in the process. Prithviraj re-captured Nagor, and defeated and killed Bhima. This is known to be historically false, as the reign of Bhima II lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Similarly, historical evidence suggests Bhima II was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, could not have killed him.\n\nDespite these discrepancies, there is some evidence of a battle between the Chahamanas and the Chaulukyas at Nagor. Two inscriptions found at Charlu village near Bikaner commemorate the death of Mohil soldiers at the battle of Nagor in 1184 CE (1241 VS). The Mohils are a branch of the Chauhans (the Chahamanas), and it is possible the inscriptions refer to the battle described in \"Prithviraj Raso\".\n\nSometime before 1187 CE, Jagaddeva Pratihara signed a peace treaty with Prithviraj. According to \"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\", a chief named Abhayada once sought Jagaddeva's permission to attack and rob the wealthy visitors from Sapadalaksha country (the Chahamana territory). In response, Jagaddeva told Abhayada that he had concluded a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty. Jaggadeva then threatened to have Abhayada sewn in a donkey's belly if he harassed the people of Sapadalaksha. Historian Dasharatha Sharma theorizes that the Chahamana-Chaulukya conflict ended with some advantage for Prithviraj, as Jagaddeva appears to have been very anxious to preserve the treaty.\n\nAbu was ruled by the Chaulukya feudatory Dharavarsha, who belonged to a branch of the Paramara dynasty. \"Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga\" by his younger brother Prahaladana describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.\n\nThe Gahadavala kingdom, centered around Kannauj and headed by another powerful king Jayachandra, was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in \"Prithviraj Raso\", Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter Samyogita, leading to a rivalry between the two kings.\n\nThe legend goes like this: King Jaichand (Jayachandra) of Kannauj decided to conduct a Rajasuya ceremony to proclaim his supremacy. Prithviraj refused to participate in this ceremony, and thus, refused to acknowledge Jaichand as the supreme king. Jaichand's daughter Samyogita fell in love with Prithviraj after hearing about his heroic exploits, and declared that she would marry only him. Jaichand arranged a swayamvara (husband-selection) ceremony for his daughter, but did not invite Prithviraj. Nevertheless, Prithviraj marched to Kannauj with a hundred warriors and eloped with Samyogita. Two-third of his warriors sacrificed their life in fight against the Gahadavala army, allowing him to escape to Delhi with Samyogita. In Delhi, Prithviraj became infatuated with his new wife, and started spending most of his time with her. He started ignoring the state affairs, which ultimately led to his defeat against Muhammad of Ghor.\n\nThis legend is also mentioned in Abu'l-Fazl's \"Ain-i-Akbari\" and Chandrashekhara's \"Surjana-Charita\" (which names the Gahadavala princess as \"Kantimati\"). \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" mentions that Prithviraj fell in love with the incarnation of an apsara Tilottama, although he had never seen this woman and was already married to other women. According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, this is probably a reference to Samyogita. However, this legend is not mentioned in other historical sources such as \"Prithviraja-Prabandha\", \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", \"Prabandha-Kosha\" and \"Hammira-Mahakavya\". The Gahadavala records are also silent about this event, including the supposed Rajasuya performance by Jayachandra.\n\nAccording to Dasharatha Sharma and R. B. Singh, there might be some historical truth in this legend, as it is mentioned in three different sources. All three sources place the event sometime before Prithviraj's final confrontation with Muhammad of Ghor in 1192 CE.\n\nThe \"Prithviraj Raso\" mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined Qila Rai Pithora fort in Delhi is attributed to Prithviraj. According to \"Prithviraj Raso\", Delhi's ruler Anangpal Tomar gave the city to his son-in-law Prithviraj, and was defeated when he wanted it back. This is historically inaccurate, as Delhi was annexed to the Chahamana territory by Prithviraj's uncle Vigraharaja IV. In addition, historical evidence suggests that Anangpal Tomar died before the birth of Prithviraj. The claim about his daughter's marriage to Prithviraj appears to have been concocted at a later date.\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the Indian subcontinent by the 12th century. By the late 12th century, the Ghazna-based Ghurid dynasty controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus River and captured Multan. In 1178 CE, he invaded Gujarat, which was ruled by the Chaulukyas (Solankis). During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the Bhati-ruled Lodhruva. The \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like Rahu to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a solar eclipse). However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms. On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the Naddula (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the Chahamanas of Naddula. Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict. The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the Battle of Kasahrada in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat.\n\nOver the next few years, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering Peshawar, Sindh, and Punjab. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him into conflict with Prithviraj.\n\n\"Prithviraja Vijaya\" mentions that Muhammad of Ghor sent an ambassador to Prithviraj, but does not provide any details. Hasan Nizami's \"Taj-ul-Maasir\" (13th century CE) states that Muhammad sent his chief judge \"Qiwam-ul Mulk\" Ruknud Din Hamza to Prithviraj's court. The envoy tried to convince Prithviraj to \"abandon belligerence and pursue the path of rectitude\", but was unsuccessful. As a result, Muhammad decided to wage a war against Prithviraj.\n\nThe medieval Muslim writers mention only one or two battles between the two rulers. The \"Tabaqat-i Nasiri\" and \"Tarikh-i-Firishta\" mention the two Battles of Tarain. \"Jami-ul-Hikaya\" and \"Taj-ul-Maasir\" mention only the second battle of Tarain, in which Prithviraj was defeated. However, the Hindu and Jain writers state that Prithviraj defeated Muhammad multiple times before being killed:\n\nWhile these accounts seem to exaggerate the number, it is possible that more than two engagements took place between the Ghurids and the Chahamanas during Prithviraj's reign. The early victories mentioned by the Hindu and Jain writers probably refer to Prithviraj's successful repulsion of raids by Ghurid generals.\n\nDuring 1190–1191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with Bathinda). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the Qazi of Tulak, supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of Delhi. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian Firishta, his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.\n\nMuhammad's original plan was to return to his base after conquering Tabarhindah, but when he heard about Prithviraj's march, he decided to put up a fight. He set out with an army, and encountered Prithviraj's forces at Tarain. In the ensuing battle, Prithviraj's army decisively defeated the Ghurids. Muhammad of Ghor was injured and forced to retreat.\n\nPrithviraj did not pursue the retreating Ghurid army, not wanting to invade hostile territory or misjudge Ghori's ambition. He only besieged the Ghurid garrison at Tabarhindah, which surrendered after 13 months of siege.\n\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to \"Prithviraj Raso\", during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad of Ghor returned to Ghazna, and made preparations to avenge his defeat. According to \"Tabaqat-i Nasiri\", he gathered a well-equipped army of 120,000 select Afghan, Tajik and Turkic horsemen over the next few months. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via Multan and Lahore, aided by Vijayaraja of Jammu.\n\nPrithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbouring Hindu kings. Nevertheless, he managed to gather a large army to counter the Ghurids. The 16th century Muslim historian Firishta estimated the strength of Prithviraj's army as 300,000 horses and 3,000 elephants, in addition to a large infantry. This is most likely a gross exaggeration, aimed at emphasizing the scale of the Ghurid victory. Prithviraj's camp, which comprised 150 feudatory chiefs, wrote a letter to Muhammad of Ghor, promising him no harm if he decided to return to his own country. Muhammad insisted that he needed time to confer his Ghazna-based brother Ghiyath al-Din. According to Firishta, he agreed to a truce until he received an answer from his brother. However, he planned an attack against the Chahamanas.\n\nAccording to \"Jawami ul-Hikayat\", Muhammad assigned a few men to keep the fires in his camp burning at night, while he marched off in another direction with the rest of his army. This gave the Chahamanas an impression that the Ghurid army was still encamped, observing the truce. After reaching several miles away, Muhammad formed four divisions, with 10,000 archers each. He kept the rest of his army in reserve. He ordered the four divisions to launch an attack on the Chahamana camp, and then pretend a retreat.\n\nAt dawn, the four divisions of the Ghurid army attacked the Chahamana camp, while Prithviraj was still asleep. After a brief fight, the Ghurid divisions pretended to retreat in accordance with Muhammad's strategy. Prithviraj was thus lured into chasing them, and by the afternoon, the Chahamana army was exhausted as a result of this pursuit. At this point, Muhammad led his reserve force and attacked the Chahamanas, decisively defeating them. According to \"Taj-ul-Maasir\", Prithviraj's camp lost 100,000 men (including Govindaraja of Delhi) in this debacle. Prithviraj himself tried to escape on a horse, but was pursued and caught near the Sarasvati fort (possibly modern Sirsa). Subsequently, Muhammad of Ghor captured Ajmer after killing several thousand defenders, enslaved many more, and destroyed the city's temples.\n\n\"Prabandha Chintamani\" by the 14th century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured. \n\n\"Hammira Mahakavya\" by the 15th century Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri states that after his initial defeat, the Ghurid king raised a fresh army with the support of a neighboring king, and marched to Delhi. Before the battle, he bribed Prithviraj's master of horses and musicians with gold coins. The master of horses had trained Prithviraj's horse to prance to drumbeats. The Ghurids attacked the Chahamana camp just before dawn, when Prithviraj was sleeping. Prithviraj tried to escape on his horse, but his musicians sounded the drums. The horse started prancing, and the invaders easily captured Prithviraj.\n\nAccording to another Jain text, \"Prithviraja Prabandha\", Prithviraj's minister Kaimbasa and his spear-bearer Pratapasimha were not on good terms. Kaimbasa once complained to king against Pratapasimha, who convinced the king that Kaimbasa was aiding the Ghurids. An angry Prithviraj attempted to kill Kaimbasa with an arrow one night, but ended up killing another man. When his bard Chand Baliddika admonished him, the king dismissed both the bard and the minister. At the time of Ghurid invasion of Delhi, Prithviraj had been sleeping for ten days. When the Ghurids came close, his sister woke him up: Prithviraj tried to flee on a horse, but Kaimbasa helped the Ghurids capture him by telling them about a certain sound that caused his horse to prance.\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital Ajmer, where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid vassal. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason. This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint, although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory. After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory.\n\nThe various sources differ on the exact circumstances:\n\n\nThe 13th-century Persian historian Minhaj-i-Siraj states that Prithviraj was \"sent to hell\" after being captured. The 16th-century historian Firishta also supports this account. According to historian Satish Chandra, Minhaj's account suggests that Prithviraj was executed immediately after his defeat, but R. B. Singh believes that no such conclusion can be drawn from Minhaj's writings. \"Viruddha-Vidhi Vidhvansa\" by the Hindu writer Lakshmidhara claims that Prithviraj was killed on the battlefield.\n\nThe \"Prithviraj Raso\" claims that Prithviraj was taken to Ghazna as a prisoner, and blinded. On hearing this, the poet Chand Bardai traveled to Ghazna and tricked Muhammad of Ghor into watching an archery performance by the blind Prithviraj. During this performance, Prithviraj shot the arrow in the direction of Muhammad's voice and killed him. Shortly after, Prithviraj and Chand Bardai killed each other. This is a fictional narrative, not supported by historical evidence: Muhammad of Ghor continued to rule for more than a decade after Prithviraj's death.\n\nAfter Prithviraj's death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal. In 1192 CE, Prithviraj's younger brother Hariraja dethroned Govindaraja, and recaptured a part of his ancestral kingdom. Govindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern Ranthambore), where he established a new Chahamana branch of vassal rulers. Hariraja was later defeated by the Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak.\n\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for pandits (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha. His court had a number of poets and scholars, including:\n\n\"Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali\" mentions a debate that took place between the Jain monks Jinapati Suri and Padmaprabha at Naranayana (modern Narena near Ajmer). Prithviraj had encamped there at the time. Jinapati was later invited to Ajmer by a rich Jain merchant. There, Prithviraj issued him a \"jaya-patra\" (certificate of victory).\n\n<mapframe text=\"Find-spots of inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign, in present-day India\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"5\" longitude=\"74.84\" latitude=\"25.98\">\n</mapframe>\n\nAccording to historian R. B. Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from Sutlej river in the west to the Betwa river in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south. Thus, it included parts of present-day Rajasthan, southern Punjab, northern Madhya Pradesh, and western Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOnly seven inscriptions dated to Prithviraj's reign are available; none of these were issued by the king himself:\n\nThe early Sanskrit descriptions of Prithviraj, from 14th and 15th centuries, present him as a mediocre, unsuccessful king who was memorable only for his defeat against a foreign king. \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" and \"Prithviraja-Prabandha\", written by Jain authors, portray him as an inept and unworthy king who was responsible for his own downfall, and whose mistreatment of his devout subordinates turned them into traitors. In contrast, the \"Hammira Mahakavya\", also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed. The \"Hammira Mahakavya\", which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two \"Prabandha\" texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero Hammira.\n\n\"Prithviraj Raso\", a legendary text patronized largely by the Rajput courts, portrays Prithviraj as a great hero. Prithviraj's dynasty was classified as one of the Rajput clans in the later period, including in \"Prithviraj Raso\", although the \"Rajput\" identity did not exist during his time.\n\nOver time, Prithviraj came to be portrayed as a patriotic Hindu warrior who fought against Muslim enemies. He is remembered as a king whose reign separated the two major epochs of Indian history. The convention of portraying Prithviraj as a Hindu king defeated as part of the Islamic conquest of India appears to have started with Hasan Nizami's \"Tajul-Ma'asir\" (early 13th century). Nizami presents his narrative as a description of \"war with enemies of the faith\" and of how \"the Islamic way of life was established in the land of the Hindus.\" \"Tajul-Ma'asir\" as well as well as the later text \"Tabaqat-i Nasiri\" (c. 1260) present the Ghurid victory over Prithviraj as an important milestone leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nThe 16th century legends describe him as the ruler of India's political centre Delhi (rather than Ajmer, which was his actual capital). For example, Abul Fazl's \"Ain-i-Akbari\" does not associate the Chahamana dynasty with Ajmer at all. Prithviraj's association with Delhi in these legends further strengthened his status as a symbol of pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nPrithviraj has been described as \"the last Hindu emperor\" in eulogies. This designation is inaccurate, as several stronger Hindu rulers flourished in South India after him, and even some contemporary Hindu rulers in northern India were at least as powerful as him. Nevertheless, the 19th century British officer James Tod repeatedly used this term to describe Prithviraj in his \"Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han\". Tod was influenced by the medieval Persian language Muslim accounts, which present Prithviraj as a major ruler and portray his defeat as a major milestone in the Islamic conquest of India. After Tod, several narratives continued to describe Prithviraj as \"the last Hindu emperor\". For example, the inscriptions at the Ajmer memorial (\"smarak\") to Prithviraj also honour him as \"the last Hindu emperor\".\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi. A number of movies and television serials have been made on his life. These include the Hindi movie \"Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan\" and the Hindi television serial \"Dharti Ka Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan\" (2006–2009). The animated movie \"Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan\" (2008) was released in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages. He was also one of the first historical figures to be covered in \"Amar Chitra Katha\" (No. 25). Many of these modern retellings depict Prithviraj as a flawless hero, and emphasize a message of Hindu national unity. \n\nIn September 2019, a historical drama film \"Prithviraj\" starring Akshay Kumar in titular role was announced by Yash Raj Films.\n\n"}

They were used as sport aircraft, as well as trainers by flying schools and the militaries of several countries.\n\nT. Claude Ryan was the founder of the Ryan Aeronautical Company, the second incarnation of a company with this name, and the fourth company with which he had been involved to bear his name (the first, Ryan Airlines, was the manufacturer of the Ryan NYP, more famously known as the \"Spirit of St. Louis\"). He began the development of the ST (for \"Sport Trainer\", and also known as S-T), the first design of the company, in 1933.\n\nThe ST featured two open cockpits in tandem in a semi-monocoque metal fuselage of two main frames – one steel, the other half of steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar in the form of a parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.\n\nFive STs were built, each powered with a 95HP Menasco B4 engine before the follow-on ST-A (A for \"A\"erobatic) was developed with a more powerful 125HP Menasco C4 engine. A single ST-B was produced, this being an ST-A with only one seat and an extra fuel tank where the front cockpit normally was; this aircraft was subsequently converted back to ST-A standard. The ST-A was further developed as the ST-A Special, with a super-charged 150HP Menasco C4-S engine of increased power.\n\nIn 1937 the ST-A Special was developed into a military version, the STM (also ST-M) series. The first STMs were virtually identical to the STA-Special. The STM-2 was derived from the STM with changes including wider cockpits to enable military pilots to enter and exit while wearing parachutes, external stringers, and provision for a machine gun on some examples. Variants in the series included the STM-2P single-seat version armed with a machine gun delivered to Nationalist China; and the STM-S2, which could be fitted with landing gear or with EDO Model 1965 floats.\n\nAfter the ST-M came the ST-3, a substantial redesign in 1941 partly brought about by the unreliability of the Menasco engines fitted to STs to that point. The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) had purchased several dozen ST-M variants under various designations and had Ryan Aeronautical re-engine most with Kinner R-440 radial engines. The USAAC found the modification to be beneficial and asked Ryan Aeronautical to design a variant with this engine as standard, and with airframe modifications considered desirable from in-service experience. The ST-3 that resulted featured a longer and more circular wider fuselage, this being suggested by the circular radial engine. Other changes included a revised rudder, balanced ailerons and elevators, and strengthened main landing gear with the legs spaced further apart. The streamlining spats covering the mainwheels, found on ST series aircraft to that point, were deleted as well. The ST-3 served as the basis for military versions ordered by the USAAC and the United States Navy (USN).\n\nThe ST-3 gave rise to another model developed in 1941 and early 1942, this was the ST-3KR (for \"K\"inner \"R\"adial). The ST-3KR had a more powerful Kinner R-5 engine fitted and became the definitive model; more than 1,000 military versions were built during World War II as PT-22 Recruits. The final variant was the ST-4, which was a version of the ST-3 with a wooden fuselage, developed in case a shortage of \"strategic materials\" (i.e. of metal) developed. Such a shortage did not eventuate and the ST-4 was not put into mass-production.\n\nSome U.S. Navy versions of the ST-3, the NR-1, were converted to specialized ground trainers to teach cadets how to taxi aircraft when on the ground or after landing, and especially in crosswinds. The main wing was clipped back to the landing gear; a small nose wheel added to prevent ground loops; a roll cage between cockpits to protect the pilot and cadet; and the throttle modified so the engine could not go over a certain RPM.\n\nThe first Ryan ST flew for the first time on 8 June 1934 and production began the following year, when nine aircraft were delivered. Except for 1937 (when 46 aircraft were built), production rates remained low for several years, at about one aircraft every two weeks. This changed in 1940 when deliveries to military forces began in earnest; production that year was just under three aircraft per week. Total production of civil and military aircraft prior to the entry of the United States into World War II amounted to 315. Another 1,253 military versions were produced in 1942 and 1943, for a total of 1,568 aircraft of all models.\n\nMost civil aircraft in the ST series were delivered in the United States, although a few were exported to South Africa, Australia and various countries in Latin America. An example of the ST-A was procured by the USAAC in 1939 for evaluation as the XPT-16. This was followed by 15 YPT-16s, the first time the USAAC had ordered a monoplane trainer. These were the first of more than 1,000 Ryan STs to serve the USAAC, its successor, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the USN.\n\nA large number of STMs were exported in the 1930s and early 1940s (prior to the entry of the United States into World War II) to various air forces, with the biggest customer being the military of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI, now Indonesia). The NEI Army and Navy took delivery of 84 STM-2s and 24 STM-S2s in 1940 and early 1941. Another 50 STM-2Es and STM-2Ps were exported to Nationalist China, while a number of STMs were exported to Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua. The STM was chosen by the South American Air-forces because of the superior performance of the super-charged Menasco engine at the high altitude airports encountered. \n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of the NEI many Ryans in that country were pressed into combat, especially in reconnaissance roles, and large numbers were shot down or destroyed on the ground. Surviving STM-2s and STM-S2s that were not captured by the Japanese were shipped to Australia, where 34 entered service in the Royal Australian Air Force as trainers. Many of those that survived until the end of World War II were then placed on the civil register in Australia and elsewhere, and some are still flying more than 70 years after they were built.\n\n\nPT-16\n\n\nNumbers used from \"World Air Forces\"\n\n\nThere are a number of surviving Ryan ST series aircraft remaining. The survivors range from project aircraft in various stages of completion to beautifully restored flying examples. There are remaining examples of the ST, STA, STA-Special, STM, STM-2 and PT20. Many of these restored examples have had their Menasco C4 engines replaced with Menasco D4-87 engines. This change was often because of the shortage of parts available for the C4 engine.\n\n"}

He was the younger brother of Krishna Deva Raya, whom he succeeded in 1529.\n\nFernao Nuniz was a Portuguese traveller, chronicler and horse trader who visited India during reign of Achyutaraya and who spent three years in Vijayanagara.\n\nHe patronised Kannada poet Chatu Vittalanatha, the great composer and singer Purandaradasa (one of the Fathers of Carnatic music), and the Sanskrit scholar Rajanatha Dindima II. Upon his death, the succession was disputed. His nephew, (younger brother's son) Sadasiva Raya, finally became king while yet a child, under the regency of Aliya Rama Raya, a son-in-law of Krishnadevaraya.\n\nThe time when Achyuta Deva Raya became the king was by no means a favorable one. The peace and prosperity of the halcyon days under Krishnadevaraya were coming to an end. Feudatories and enemies were waiting for an opportunity to bring down the empire. In addition, Achyuta Deva Raya had to contend with the powerful Aliya Rama Raya, who was competing for the throne.\n\nWhile the works of Nuniz speak very lowly of Achyuta Deva Raya as being a king given to vices and cruelty, there is enough evidence to prove that the king was indeed noteworthy in his own right and fought hard to keep the prosperity of the kingdom alive. He had been handpicked by Krishna Deva Raya himself as an able successor.\n\nIsmail Adil Shah of Bijapur invaded and captured the Raichur doab. However the Gajapati's of Orissa and Quli Qutub Shah of Golconda were defeated and pushed back. Now Achyuta Deva Raya along with his general Salakaraju Tirumala went on a southern campaign to bring the chiefs of Travancore and Ummatur under control. This they did successfully. Then they invaded the doab north of Tungabhadra and recaptured the forts of Raichur and Mudgal.\n\nThe two Sanskrit works \"Achyutabhyudayam\" and \"Varadambikaparinayam\" describe the king's life and rule in detail.\n\nThroughout his rule, Achyuta Deva Raya had to contend with the manipulations of Rama Raya who in his powerful capacity had replaced many of the faithful servants of the Kingdom in high ranking positions with men of his own favour. On more than one occasion the Bahamani Sultans were brought in to play the role of mediator between the king and Ailya Rama Raya in the game of power sharing. This would further weaken the kingdom. Around 1540 Aliya Rama Raya imprisoned Achyuta Deva Raya in a coup.\n\nIn 1542 Achyuta Deva Raya died, and was succeeded by his young son of Venkata I (Venkata Raya or Venkatadri Raya). But he was soon killed, and Sadasiva Raya became the new king. Aliya Rama Raya became the regent and let very little governance in the hands of Sadasiva Raya.\n\nThe Tiruvengalanatha temple was built at Vijayanagara during his reign. It has become popularly known by his name as Achyutaraya temple, rather than by the name of the deity Lord Venkateshwara to whom the temple was dedicated.\n\n\n"}

Because this idea was preposterous, it needed testing before we did the proper thing on a beach in Somerset. The test… was done on a small grass aerodrome near London.\"\n\nThe version of the artwork featuring a man in bed on the beach is clearly indebted to another Thorgerson creation: Pink Floyd's \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\".\n\n\n"}

His post was then split into three positions: he was succeeded as Cabinet Secretary by Sir Jeremy Heywood, as Head of the Home Civil Service by Sir Bob Kerslake (in a part-time role), and as Permanent Secretary in the Cabinet Office by Ian Watmore. Whilst Cabinet Secretary, O'Donnell was regularly referred to within the Civil Service, and subsequently in the popular press, as \"GOD\"; this was mainly because of his initials. In 2012, O'Donnell joined Frontier Economics as a Senior Advisor.\n\nO'Donnell was born and raised in south London. Educated at Salesian College, Battersea, he read Economics at the University of Warwick before taking his MPhil degree at Nuffield College, Oxford. He gained a PhD degree from and was a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in the Political Economy Department from 1975 until 1979, when he joined the Treasury as an economist.\n\nIn 1985, he joined the British Embassy in Washington, serving as the First Secretary of the Economics division for four years. In 1989 O'Donnell became press secretary for the Chancellor of the Exchequer before transferring next door to serve as press secretary to the Prime Minister from 1990 to 1994.\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, O'Donnell was the United Kingdom's Executive Director to both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, again in Washington, before returning to HM Treasury to serve as both Director of Macroeconomic Policy and Prospects and also Head of the Government Economics Service, with overall responsibility for the professional economists in Her Majesty's Government. A year later, in 1999, he was appointed Managing Director of Macroeconomic Policy and International Finance, with responsibility for Fiscal Policy, International Development, and European Union Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nIn 2002, O'Donnell took over from Sir Andrew Turnbull as Permanent Secretary of the Treasury when Sir Andrew became Cabinet Secretary. Three years later, on 15 June 2005, it was announced that O'Donnell would again replace Turnbull, this time as Cabinet Secretary, on the latter's retirement at the end of that summer. He took up office in September 2005.\n\nO'Donnell is known for his \"wondrous interpersonal gifts\" and his informal style. He regularly visited Civil Service departments outside London \"to meet civil servants at work\".\n\nDuring his time as Cabinet Secretary, his authority was seen as absolute, giving rise to the affectionate nickname \"GOD\" based on his initials as they appeared in Government papers.\n\nThe annual remuneration for this position was £235,000.\n\nIn his role as Cabinet Secretary, O'Donnell was responsible for overseeing the review of Christopher Meyer's controversial memoirs, \"DC Confidential\", in November 2005. The previous month he had told the Public Administration Select Committee that it was \"wrong\" for civil servants to publish personal memoirs.\n\n\"Channel 4 News\" on 10 August 2010 had reported that O'Donnell would leave his post before the end of the current Parliament.\n\nIn January 2011, it emerged that O'Donnell had decided not to publish correspondence sent between Tony Blair and George W Bush prior to the 2003 invasion. The papers were, however, provided to the Iraq Inquiry itself. His reasoning is explained in several documents between himself and Sir John Chilcot.\n\nIn November 2010, O'Donnell published a draft copy of the Cabinet manual. This document outlines the laws, rules and conventions that apply to the British executive.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, it was announced by Downing Street that O'Donnell was to retire at the end of the year. His successor was announced as the Downing Street Permanent Secretary Jeremy Heywood. However the roles of Cabinet Secretary, Head of the Civil Service and Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office were split.\n\nOn 22 December 2011, O'Donnell said that the future of the Union is one of several \"enormous challenges\" facing the political establishment in the coming years. The admission from such a senior non-political figure that the break-up of Britain is now a real possibility is likely to push the issue up the political agenda. \"Over the next few years there will be enormous challenges, such as whether to keep our kingdom united,\" he warns officials and politicians.\n\nIn addition to being the chair of Frontier Economics, O'Donnell is also visiting professor to the London School of Economics and University College London.\n\nHe is also a trustee of the Economist Group.\n\nHe is a strategic adviser to the chief executive of Toronto Dominion Bank, a fellow of the Institute for Government\nand was the chairman of the Commission on Wellbeing at the Legatum Institute.\n\nIn 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by 2025.\n\nO'Donnell has been a leader in the wellbeing and happiness movements. He chaired the development group of founding partners setting up the What Works Centre for Wellbeing. He is a supporter of Action for Happiness.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, O'Donnell was created a life peer as Baron O'Donnell, of Clapham in the London Borough of Wandsworth, and was introduced in the House of Lords, where he sits as a crossbencher, on 12 January 2012. In his first speech in the House of Lords, in June 2012, Lord O'Donnell warned that too many Treasury officials were leaving and that staff are underpaid, and that the Treasury may be struggling to address the problems caused by the ongoing global financial turmoil.\n\nO'Donnell supports a liberal immigration policy, saying in 2011 that \"[w]hen I was at the Treasury I argued for the most open door possible to immigration … I think it’s my job to maximise global welfare not national welfare.\" O'Donnell has repeated this view in a milder form in newspaper articles, and thinks that his views about immigration are in the interests of the average British person, notwithstanding some short-term losers.\n\nIn 2017 he warned that \"there was no way Brexit would happen smoothly.\"\n\nO'Donnell is a keen sportsman, having played football for the University of Warwick First XI and for Oxford, earning two Blues in 1973/4 and 1974/5. While Permanent Secretary at the Treasury he won a football medal at the annual Civil Service Sports Day—the first Permanent Secretary to do so. O'Donnell has played for the \"Mandarins Cricket Club\" for many years, the third Cabinet Secretary to do so (the others being Sir Robin Butler and Sir Andrew Turnbull). He is a keen supporter of Manchester United.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Tablet\" named him as one of Britain’s most influential Roman Catholics.\n\nO'Donnell was formerly a governor of his alma mater, Salesian College, Battersea.\n\nO'Donnell has received several appointments to the Most Honourable Order of the Bath: he was appointed Companion (CB) in the 1994 New Year Honours, Knight Commander (KCB) in the 2005 Birthday Honours and Knight Grand Cross (GCB) in the 2011 Birthday Honours. The Parliamentary Public Administration Committee cited the example of at least one of O'Donnell's appointments [his knighthood] to the Order as automatic honours granted due to his position and not for exceptional service, although it is not specified if all of his honours were granted solely due to his position or if some were due to exceptional service.\n\nIn 2014, O'Donnell was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy. In 2016, he was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS).\n\n"}

At the age of sixteen he became a student at Uppsala University, where he distinguished himself, and where, in 1866, having taken the degree of doctor, he was appointed reader in history.\n\nAt the age of thirty, however, Forssell, who had already shown remarkable business capacity, was called to Stockholm, where he filled one important post after another in the Swedish civil service. In 1875, he was appointed head of the treasury, and in 1880 was transferred to the, department of inland revenue, of which he continued to be president until the time of his death. In addition to the responsibilities which these offices devolved upon him, Forssell was constantly called to serve on royal commissions, and his political influence was immense. In spite of all these public duties, which he carried through with the utmost diligence, Forssell also found leisure for an abundant literary activity.\n\nOf his historical writings the most important were: \"Sveriges inre historia från Gustaf den förste, med särskildt afseende på förvaltning och ekonomi\" (\"The Administrative and Economical History of Sweden after Gustavus I\"; 1869–1875) and \"Sverige 1571. Försök till en administrativ-statistisk beskrifning...\" (\"Sweden in 1571\"; 1872). He was also for several years, in company with the poet Carl David af Wirsén, editor of the Swedish Literary Review. He published two volumes of Studies and Criticisms (1875, 1888). In the year 1881, at the death of the historian Anders Fryxell, Forssell was elected to the vacant seat on the Swedish Academy. He was also a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1876.\n\nThe energy of Forssell was so great, and he understood so little the economy of strength, that he unquestionably overtaxed his vital force. His death, however, which occurred with great suddenness on 2 August 1901 while he was staying at San Bernardino in Switzerland, was wholly unexpected. There was little of the typical Swedish urbanity in Forssell's exterior manner, which was somewhat dry and abrupt. Like many able men who have from early life administered responsible public posts, there appeared a certain want of sympathy in his demands upon others. His views were distinct, and held with great firmness; for example, he was a free-trader, and his consistent opposition to what he called the new system had a considerable effect on Swedish policy. He was not exactly an attractive man, but he was a capable, upright and efficient public servant. In 1867 he married his cousin Hildegard Zuleima Eneroth, a goldsmith's daughter from Stockholm; she survived him, with two sons and two daughters.\n"}

{"id": "2052075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052075", "title": "The Velvelettes", "text": "The Velvelettes\n\nThe Velvelettes were an American singing girl group, signed to Motown in the 1960s. Their biggest chart success occurred in 1964, when Norman Whitfield produced \"Needle in a Haystack\", which peaked at number 45 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe group was founded in 1961 by Bertha Barbee McNeal and Mildred Gill Arbor, students at Western Michigan University. Mildred recruited her younger sister Carolyn (also known as Cal or Caldin), who was in 9th grade, and Cal's friend Betty Kelley, a junior in high school. Bertha recruited her cousin Norma Barbee, a freshman at Flint Junior College. Cal was chosen as the group's lead singer.\n\nA classmate at Western Michigan University, Robert Bullock, was Berry Gordy's nephew, and he encouraged the group to audition for Motown. The group signed to Motown in late 1962 and started recording in January 1963. They recorded at the Hitsville USA studio and \"There He Goes\" and \"That's The Reason Why\", produced by William Stevenson, was released as a single via the IPG Records label (Independent Producers Group). The recordings included a young Stevie Wonder playing harmonica. While the group awaited their chance at stardom, they recorded for many producers, some of which were re-recorded by other artists including fellow labelmates Martha and the Vandellas and The Supremes. The Velvelettes were not used to provide backing vocals since Motown already had its in-house backing group, The Andantes.\n\nThe Velvelettes got their break chartwise in the spring of 1964 thanks to young producer Norman Whitfield, who produced \"Needle in a Haystack\" as a single for the group, on Motown's VIP Records imprint. \"Needle in a Haystack\" peaked at number 45 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in mid 1964. The group recorded its follow-up, \"He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'\", with Whitfield again producing, and spent time on various Motown-sponsored tours as a support act. In September 1964, after recording \"Dancing in the Street\" earlier in June, Betty Kelley officially left the group to join Martha and the Vandellas, and the quintet became a quartet.\n\nThe Velvelettes continued performing, with various members leaving and rejoining, as family matters dictated. By 1967, Gill, Norma and Bertha Barbee had decided to devote all of their time to raising their families. Cal recruited two new members for concert performances: future Vandella Sandra Tilley (who was introduced by her friend Abdul Fakir of The Four Tops), and Annette McMullen.\n\nWith a song on the charts and a place on several concert tours, an album project was started using songs already recorded. However, with the growing success of other Motown groups such as The Supremes, Motown's attention was diverted and the project was left unfinished. The LP was scheduled for release on Motown's V.I.P. label, as V.I.P 401.\n\nMotown released two additional singles, \"Lonely Lonely Girl Am I\" and \"A Bird in the Hand\" on their V.I.P. imprint. Both singles did not reach the same chart levels as their predecessors. The Velvelettes continued to record new material until September 1967, with the Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson song \"Bring Back The Sunshine\", which was retitled \"Dark Side of the World\" when Diana Ross later released a version of the song. The final Velvelettes single release (after an internal label change to Motown's Soul subsidiary) was \"These Things Will Keep Me Loving You\", which made number 43 on the US R&B Charts. Carolyn Gill began dating Richard Street, lead singer of The Monitors, who later joined The Temptations. Sandra Tilley joined Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, replacing Rosalind Ashford. Gill married Street in November 1969 and he dissuaded her from continuing with the Velvelettes (preferring that his wife care for the home) so Gill decided to break up the group and it disbanded.\n\nIn 1971, \"These Things Will Keep Me Loving You\" became a hit in the United Kingdom, number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite the new success, the group did not reunite until 1984, following a rare concert appearance by the cousins and the sisters at the request of Barbee. Together the Gill sisters and Barbee cousins then went on to re-record their original hits and some new songs for the album \"One Door Closes\" for Motorcity Records. The group continues to tour today.\n\nThree decades after the group left Motown, the company released a CD, \"The Very Best of the Velvelettes\", featuring 15 tracks, including four previously unreleased selections. A 19-track CD \"The Velvelettes: The Best Of\" was released in the UK in 2001. The 2004 \"The Velvelettes: The Motown Anthology\" is a double album with 48 tracks.\n\nIn 2006, the Velvelettes contributed to the double CD \"Masters of Funk, Soul and Blues Present a Soulful Tale of Two Cities\". Lamont Dozier, Freda Payne, George Clinton and Bobby Taylor recorded remakes of songs from Philadelphia International Records. The Velvelettes sang \"One Of a Kind Love Affair\", originally recorded by the Spinners. The other CD featured Jean Carne, Bunny Sigler and Jimmy Ellis.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052079", "title": "Lovat Scouts", "text": "Lovat Scouts\n\nThe Lovat Scouts was a British Army unit first formed during the Second Boer War as a Scottish Highland yeomanry regiment of the British Army. They were the first known military unit to wear a ghillie suit and in 1916 formally became the British Army's first sniper unit, then known as \"sharpshooters\". It served in the First World War and the Second World War and today forms A (The Lovat Scouts) Company within the 2nd Battalion, 51st Highland Volunteers.\n\nThe regiment was formed in January 1900 for service in the Second Boer War by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat as the Lovat Scouts. Recruited initially from gamekeepers on Highland estates, the unit was commanded by an American, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts, who fittingly described Lovat Scouts as \"half wolf and half jackrabbit\". Burnham would later go on to become one of the founders of the Boy Scouts. Well practiced in the arts of marksmanship, fieldcraft and military tactics, they were also phenomenal woodsmen always ready to tempt fate, but also practitioners of discretion: \"He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day.\" Lovats scouts have the distinction of being the first military unit to wear a Ghillie suit.\n\nLovat scouts were attached to the Black Watch, but were disbanded in July 1901 while two companies (the 113th and 114th) were formed for the Imperial Yeomanry. After the end of the Second Boer War in June 1902, the two companies of the Imperial Yeomanry returned to the United Kingdom on SS \"Tintagel Castle\" two months later, and were disbanded. The unit was reformed the following year, consisting of two regiments, titled the 1st and 2nd Lovat Scouts. From these scouts a sharpshooter unit was formed and formally become the British Army's first sniper unit. The regiment was disbanded in August 1902 but reformed as Lovat's Scouts Imperial Yeomanry in March 1903. It reverted to the Lovat's Scouts in April 1908. The regiment was based at Croyard Road near Beauly at this time (since demolished).\n\nIn accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (\"7 Edw. 7, c.9\") which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.\n\nThe 1/1st Lovat's Scouts Yeomanry landed in Gallipoli in September 1915. It was evacuated to Egypt in December 1915 and then converted into 10th (Lovat's Scouts) Battalion, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in September 1916. It landed at Salonika and under the command of 82nd Brigade in the 27th Division in October 1916 and then became Line of Communication troops in France in June 1918.\n\nThe 2nd Line regiments were formed in 1914 and in January 1915 joined the 2/1st Highland Mounted Brigade. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence; the brigade became the 1st Mounted Brigade and joined 1st Mounted Division in Norfolk.\n\nIn July 1916, the 1st Mounted Division was reorganised as the 1st Cyclist Division and the regiments were converted to cyclist units in the 1st Cyclist Brigade of the division at Somerleyton near Lowestoft. In November 1916, the 1st Cyclist Division was broken up and the regiments were merged to form 1st (Lovat's Scouts) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment, still in the 1st Cyclist Brigade. In March 1917, they resumed their identities as 2/1st Lovat's Scouts and 2/2nd Lovat's Scouts at Gorleston. By July 1917, the regiments had moved to Beccles, where they remained until the end of the war, still in 1st Cyclist Brigade.\n\nThe 3rd Line regiments were raised in July 1915 at Beauly and affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Aldershot. They provided drafts to 1st and 2nd Line regiments. In June 1916, they moved to Perth. The regiments were disbanded in January 1917 with personnel transferring to the 2nd Line units or to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders at Invergordon.\n\nIn 1916 the regiment formed detachments known as \"sharpshooters\" which used for observation and sniping work in France.\n\nPostwar, a commission was set up to consider the shape of the Territorial Force (Territorial Army from 1 October 1921). The experience of the First World War made it clear that cavalry was surfeit. The commission decided that only the 14 most senior regiments were to be retained as cavalry. Eight regiments were converted to Armoured Car Companies of the Royal Tank Corps (RTC), one was reduced to a battery in another regiment, one was absorbed into a local infantry battalion, one became a signals regiment and two were disbanded. The remaining 25 regiments were converted to brigades of the Royal Field Artillery between 1920 and 1922. The Lovat Scouts was reduced to a single regiment, but remained mounted as a \"scouts\" unit—as did the Scottish Horse.\n\nFrom May 1940 to June 1942, the Lovat Scouts provided the garrison in the Faroe Islands, protecting against the feared German invasion. After a period based in northern Scotland and Wales, the regiment was sent to Canada in December 1943 for specialist ski and mountain training. They sailed on the \"Mauretania\" for 11 days. They pulled into Grand Central Station, New York and then travelled on the Canadian Pacific Railway eventually arriving in Jasper National Park after five days. The training started with basic ski training, with the emphasis on cross country work with the type of load that would have to be carried in action e.g. sleeping bag, rations for two or more days, and a rifle. This was followed by survival instruction—what to do and what not to do to exist and function in very cold conditions e.g. by digging snow holes in which to sleep, or erecting simple shelters from the virgin pine and spruce forests. After this stage, there was instruction and practice in ascents on snow and ice, use of ice axe, crampons etc.\n\nTypically, men would spend three or four weeks at a mountain base, in the vicinity of Mount Edith Cavell, or in the Tonquin Valley—all within the 4200 square miles of Jasper National Park. In that time, squadrons would practice their survival work in expeditions usually lasting about two or three days at a time, with the men sleeping in snow holes. For the remainder of the time, they were billeted in canvas marquees, each accommodating about 25 men, with a large wood-burning stove in the middle that was kept on night and day with logs sawn from the fallen or naturally dead trees in the area.\n\nAt the end of the three or four weeks on Mount Edith Cavell or in the Tonquin Valley, the men would come down for a few days' rest and recreation in the chalets in Jasper, Alberta. Alberta was then a \"dry\" province, so there was no alcohol. When a few days' leave was given, most made the 500-mile journey to Vancouver or Halifax, Nova Scotia or Windsor, Ontario, where they were entertained by the many Scottish expatriates, or their descendants, who were able to get limitless supplies of liquor from over the U.S. border.\n\nBy late April, spring was well on the way, and the regiment embarked by train for a journey to Halifax. Their intended embarkation there was delayed when some fell ill with scarlet fever, but training continued with work on river crossing, whether or not the individual soldiers could swim, and route marches. Eventually, all embarked on the converted liner \"Andes\" on convoy, which had an uneventful crossing, being in mid-Atlantic on 6 June, the day of the Normandy landings. On landing at Liverpool, the regiment entrained for Aberdeen Kittybrewster railway station, where it spent about three weeks, including spells of home leave.\n\nAs a consequence of its training in Jasper, the Scouts was sent to Italy. The Scouts arrived in Naples, Italy in July 1944, to take their part in the relatively fluid situation between the fall of Monte Cassino. As part of, successively, the 10th Indian Infantry Division, II Corps (Poland), and latterly the recently arrived Jewish Brigade, the regiment took part in the remainder of the Italian campaign, and the German surrender in early May 1945.\n\nAt the end of the war in Europe, the regiment drove north, through the Brenner Pass, into Austria, where they sought out senior members of the Nazi party. In early 1946, the regiment moved to Greece by plane, landing in Salonika in support of the Greek Civil Power during the communist insurgency. Upon the reconstitution of the Territorial Army in 1947, the regiment was reduced to a squadron (C (Lovat Scouts) Squadron) of The Scottish Horse, part of the Royal Armoured Corps. It was converted to artillery becoming the 677th Mountain Artillery, RA (Lovat Scouts) in 1949 and the 540th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Lovat Scouts) in 1950.\n\nAfter the defence cuts of 1967, the unit became A (The Lovat Scouts) Company, 2nd Battalion, 51st Highland Volunteers.

The object of the operation was to engage the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division.\n\nThe Quế Sơn Valley is located along the border of Quảng Nam and Quảng Tín Provinces. During the Vietnam War it lay in the southern part of South Vietnam's I Corps. Populous and rice-rich, the valley was viewed as one of the keys to controlling South Vietnam's five northern provinces by the communists and by early 1967 at least two regiments of the PAVN 2nd Division had been infiltrated into the area.\n\nThe 5th Marine Regiment minus its 2nd Battalion, an experienced force that had fought in Vietnam since their arrival in mid-1966, was assigned to the valley in 1967 to support the outnumbered Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces in the area, the 6th ARVN Regiment and the 1st Ranger Group.\n\nSince mid-January 1967 Company F, a reinforced company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, had manned an outpost atop Nui Loc Son (Loc Son Mountain), which dominated the southern Que Son Valley. Although the PAVN and Vietcong (VC) forces operating in the valley did not initially take much notice of the Marines, on April 15, 1967 the Company F commander advised Colonel Emil Radics, the commander of the 1st Marine Regiment, that PAVN/VC units appeared to be preparing for an all-out assault on the outpost.\n\nRadics developed a plan for a multi-battalion assault and sweep aimed at clearing PAVN units from the vicinity of the mountain. The plan was approved as Operation Union by Major General Herman Nickerson Jr., the commanding general of the 1st Marine Division on April 20 and was put into action the following morning.\n\nActing as bait, Company F was ordered to leave its outpost to sweep toward Binh Son, the nearest enemy-held village complex. Contact with PAVN elements began around 07:00, shortly developing into a full battle. PFC Gary W. Martini would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. The Marine company was soon pinned down in a tree line near Binh Son, thereby fixing the PAVN forces who were soon subjected to a withering air and artillery bombardment. This allowed Company F to attack into Binh Son as the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, arrived to support them via a helicopter assault.\n\nThe main body of the 3/1 Marines fought into the village to join Company F in engaging the enemy while other elements of the battalion landed from helicopters east of the battlefield to block the PAVN’s most likely escape route. During the afternoon, United States Army 175 mm self-propelled artillery and Marine 105 mm howitzers established separate firebases near the battlefield, and that evening the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines landed atop Nui Loc Son.\n\nOn the morning of 22 April the PAVN had been driven out of Binh Son and withdrew to the north. On 25 April the 5th Marine Regiment relieved the 1st Marine Regiment in the valley.\n\nOn 27 April a Marine triggered a land mine in a landing zone which set off a series of secondary explosions resulting in 1 Marine killed and 43 wounded.\n\nOn 10 May, Company C 1/5 Marines became pinned down by PAVN fire on Hill 110, two more Companies from 1/3 Marines were sent to support them which also came under fire and were unable to advance. Company A 1/5 Marines was sent in support, but as it began its assault a forward air controller misplaced an airstrike on their position resulting in 5 Marines killed and 24 wounded stopping their assault. Company D 1/5 Marines then moved to outflank the PAVN position while Company M 3/5 Marines also joined the battle. By evening the Marines had overrun the PAVN positions killing 116 PAVN for the loss of 33 Marines killed and 135 wounded.\n\nOn 13 May the 1/5 Marines engaged a PAVN Battalion killing 122 PAVN. On 15 May Companies A and M found a PAVN bunker complex and called in air and artillery struck, 22 PAVN bodies were found in the wreckage.\n\nOperation Union concluded with US forces claiming that the PAVN suffered 865 casualties for the loss of 110 Marine dead, 2 missing and 473 wounded.\n\nThe 5th Marine Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation awarded by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nOn 26 May, 5th Marines, which had assumed control of the latter stages of Operation Union, kicked off Operation Union II.\n\n"}

Through his artistic and institutional reform efforts, he is credited with its revitalization and refinement, paving the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the 20th century. He is often called the Croatian Verdi.\n\nIvan Dragutin Stjepan Zajc was born in Fiume, modern-day Rijeka, Croatia. His family migrated from Bratislava, Slovakia; his father, Johann Zaytz, was of Czech descent, and his mother, Anna Bodensteiner was of German descent. His musical talent was evident very early on in his life, as he began to study the piano and violin at the age of five, performed in public by the age of six, and even began to compose his own music by the age of twelve. Nevertheless, despite his early musical success, his military bandmaster father was opposed to the idea of a career in music and wanted him to study law instead following the completion of his secondary education. In the end, Zajc's professors prevailed and he entered the Milan Conservatory in 1850 with his father's consent.\n\nZajc studied in Milan from 1850 to 1855, under the supervision of Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti (counterpoint and composition), Alberto Mazzucato (orchestration), and Lauro Rossi (dramatic music). During this period, Zajc took his studies very seriously and regularly won prizes as one of the conservatory's most talented students. He was awarded first prize at his graduation examination for the opera \"La Tirolese\" (1855), which was performed on stage in the same year. Zajc's future as a composer and conductor in Milan was secure, but the death of his parents in the meantime forced him to return to Rijeka.\n\nBack home, he accepted the post of conductor and concert master of the Town Theatre Orchestra, taught stringed instruments at the Philharmonic Institute, and simultaneously wrote numerous compositions with his characteristic speed and ease. In 1860, his opera \"Amelia ossia Il Bandito\" was met with great success, though two years later, after a prolonged illness, Zajc chose to move to Vienna, where opera and theatre were flourishing. His eight-year stay there (1862–70) was marked by further success, though he settled for composing operettas rather than operas. His first Viennese work, \"Mannschaft an Bord\" (1863), was enormously well received and his later operettas only served to strengthen his growing reputation. Yet it was in Vienna that Zajc became involved with the Croatian academic society Velebit and frequently met with young Croatian students. Influenced by such Croatian cultural figures as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer and poets Petar Preradović, Ivan Trnski, August Šenoa, and Matija Divković, Zajc chose patriotism over world fame and returned to Croatia.\n\nUpon his arrival in Zagreb in 1870, Zajc was presented with two posts: director and conductor of the Croatian Opera and director and teacher at the Croatian Institute of Music. It was during this period that Zajc made his colossal contribution to Croatian musical culture, not only through his compositions, but also through his leadership in reorganizing Zagreb's musical institutions. He was also an excellent vocal teacher and succeeded in training several prominent singers. Zajc was an exceptionally prolific composer as evidenced by almost 1000 works, from Op. 234 to Op. 1202, produced during his time in Zagreb. Included in this number are \"Mislav\" (1870), \"Ban Leget\" (1872), his masterpiece \"Nikola Šubić Zrinski\" (1876), and \"Lizinka\" (1878), in addition to operettas, musical comedies, cantatas, songs and choral compositions, concerti, chamber music, and many other works.\n\nZajc's appointment at the opera was held until 1889, when owing to financial difficulties the organization lapsed for a time, but Zajc retained his post at the school until 1908, when he finally retired. He is credited with reviving Croatian music during a period of musical stagnation after the collapse of the Illyrian Movement and raising it to the artistic level where it stands today. His efforts paved the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the early 20th century, which Zajc himself lived to see until his death on December 16, 1914 in Zagreb.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052143", "title": "Titanic (1943 film)", "text": "Titanic (1943 film)\n\nTitanic is a 1943 German propaganda film made during World War II in Berlin by Tobis Productions for UFA, depicting the catastrophic sinking of in 1912. Despite the fact that there already was a German silent film produced in 1912 just four weeks after the sinking and a British company had released a German-language film about the disaster in 1929, the film was commissioned by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels with the intent of showing not only the superiority of German filmmaking, but also as a propaganda vehicle which would show that British and American capitalism was responsible for the disaster. The addition of an entirely fictional heroic German officer to the ship's crew was intended to demonstrate the superior bravery and selflessness of German men as compared to the British officers.\n\nThe film's original director, Herbert Selpin, was arrested during production after speaking out against the Nazi regime – he was later found hanged in prison – and the film was completed by Werner Klingler, who was not credited.\n\nAlthough the film had a brief theatrical run in parts of German-occupied Europe starting in November 1943, it was not shown within Germany by order of Goebbels, who feared that it would weaken the German citizenry's morale instead of improving it. Goebbels later banned the playing of the film entirely, and it did not have a second run.\n\nThe film was the first on the subject which was simply titled \"Titanic\", and the first to combine various fictional characters and subplots with the true events of the sinking; both conventions went on to become a staple of \"Titanic\" films.\n\nA proclamation to the stockholders of the White Star Line declares the value of their stock is falling. The president of the Line, J. Bruce Ismay (E.F. Fürbringer), promises to reveal a secret during the maiden voyage of the line's new that will change that. He alone knows she can break the speed record and receive the Blue Riband, and he believes this will raise the stock's value. Ismay and the board of the White Star Line plan to manipulate the stock by selling short their own stock in order to buy it back at a lower price just before the news about the ship's record speed is revealed to the press.\n\nOn Titanics maiden voyage in April 1912, First Officer Petersen (Hans Nielsen), the sole German crew member onboard, begs the arrogant Bruce Ismay to slow the ship while sailing through ice infested North Atlantic waters, but Ismay refuses and pressures the weak-willed Captain Smith to keep up the vessel's record breaking speed. Because of Ismay's recklessness, \"Titanic\" hits an iceberg and begins to sink. The passengers in First Class act like cowards, while Petersen, his Russian aristocrat ex-lover Sigrid Olinsky (Sybille Schmitz), and several German passengers in steerage behave bravely and with dignity. With Sigrid's assistance, Petersen manages to rescue many passengers before convincing her to board one of the last lifeboats. He then arranges a seat for Ismay in order for him to stand trial for causing the disaster. As the water ravages through the ship, Peterson finds a young girl, left to die in her cabin by her uncaring capitalist parents. Petersen leaps from the sloping deck with the girl in his arms and is pulled aboard Sigrid's lifeboat, where the two are reunited; the occupants then watch in horror as \"Titanic\" plunges beneath the waves.\n\nAt the British Inquiry into the disaster, Petersen testifies against Ismay, condemning his actions, but Ismay is cleared of all charges and the blame is placed squarely on the deceased Captain Smith's shoulders. An epilogue states that \"the deaths of 1,500 people remain un-atoned, an eternal condemnation of Britain's endless quest for profit.\"\n\n\nMost of the film was shot at the German-occupied Polish Baltic Sea port of Gdynia (renamed \"Gotenhafen\"), on board , a passenger liner that eventually shared \"Titanic\"s fate; it was sunk a few days before the end of World War II by the Royal Air Force on May 3, 1945, with loss of life more than three times than that on the actual \"Titanic\". The ship had been turned into a prison ship and filled with Jewish inmates that the Nazis had put there in hopes that the ship would be destroyed by the British.\n\nThe scenes with the lifeboats were also filmed on the Baltic Sea; some of the interior scenes were shot in Tobis Studios.\n\n\"Titanic\" endured many production difficulties, including a clash of egos, massive creative differences and general war-time frustrations. As filming progressed, more extravagant sets were demanded by Selpin, as well as additional resources from the German Navy – these demands were all approved by Goebbels, despite the mounting costs and the drain on the wartime German economy.\n\nAfter one week of troubled shooting on \"Cap Arcona\", with the Allies bombing not far away, Herbert Selpin called a crisis meeting where he made unflattering comments about the \"Kriegsmarine\" officers who were supposed to be marine consultants for the film, but were more interested in molesting female cast members. Selpin's close friend and the co-writer of the script, Walter Zerlett-Olfenius, reported him to the Gestapo, and Selpin was promptly arrested and personally questioned by Joseph Goebbels, who was the driving force behind the \"Titanic\" project. Selpin, however, did not retract his statement – infuriating Goebbels, since the Propaganda Minister had personally chosen Selpin to direct his propaganda epic. Within 24 hours of his arrest, Selpin was found hanged in his jail cell, which was ruled a suicide. However, in reality, Goebbels had arranged for Selpin to be hanged and the hanging framed as a suicide. The cast and crew were angry at the attempt to cover up Selpin's obvious murder and attempted to retaliate, but Goebbels countered them by issuing a proclamation stating that anyone who shunned Zerlett-Olfenius, who had reported Selpin, would answer to him personally. The unfinished film, on which the production costs were spiraling wildly out of control, was in the end completed by an uncredited Werner Klingler.\n\nThe film cost almost 4 million Reichsmarks (equivalent to million euros). It is said to be the most expensive film of its time.\n\nThe faults of capitalism and the stock market play a dominant role throughout the movie. \"Titanic\" makes the allegory of the liner's loss specifically about British avarice rather than, as most retellings do, about \"hubris\". This fits in with other works of anti-British propaganda of the time such as \"The Maiden Joanna\", \"The Heart of a Queen\", \"The Fox of Glenarvon\", \"Uncle Krüger\", and \"My Life for Ireland\".\n\nUndermining the intended effect were the scenes of British and French panic and desperation. Scenes of steerage passengers separated by crew members and desperately searching for their loved ones through locked gates and a chain link fence bore an uncanny resemblance to what was happening in German concentration camps during that time. This contributed to the film being banned by Goebbels inside Germany.\n\n\"Titanic\" was to premiere in early 1943, but the theatre that housed the answer print was bombed by Royal Air Force planes the night before. The film went on to have a respectable premiere in Paris in November 1943 \"where it was surprisingly well-received by its audience\", and also played well in some other capital cities of Nazi-occupied Europe such as Prague. But Goebbels banned its playing in Germany altogether, stating that the German people – who were at that point going through almost nightly Allied bombing raids – were less than enthusiastic about seeing a film that portrayed mass death and panic. The Nazi leadership was also displeased with the manner in which the fictional character Petersen critiqued his superiors, which they regarded to be at odds with the \"Führerprinzip\" which demanded Germans unquestioningly obey the orders of their superiors.\n\nShortly after the war \"Titanic\", dubbed in Russian and with the opening credits removed to hide its origin, was screened across the Eastern Bloc as a \"trophy film.\" The film was later reissued in 1949, but was quickly banned in most Allied occupied territories until a censored version, deleting the final scene at the inquiry and several other moments of overt anti-British propaganda, was approved for distribution in West Germany. After the 1950s, \"Titanic\" went back into obscurity, sometimes showing on European television. A VHS of the censored version was released in Germany in 1992.

{"id": "2052150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052150", "title": "Jacobean architecture", "text": "Jacobean architecture\n\nThe Jacobean style is the second phase of Renaissance architecture in England, following the Elizabethan style. It is named after King James I of England, with whose reign (1603–1625 in England) it is associated. At the start of James' reign there was little stylistic break in architecture, as Elizabethan trends continued their development. However, his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture, with Italian influence, was in progress, led by Inigo Jones; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture, or English Baroque (though the latter term may be regarded as starting later).\n\nCourtiers continued to build large prodigy houses, even though James spent less time on summer progresses round his realm than Elizabeth had. The influence of Flemish and German Northern Mannerism increased, now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists, rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign. There continued to be very little building of new churches, though a considerable amount of modifications to old ones, but a great deal of secular building.\n\nThe reign of James VI of Scotland (or James I of England (1603–1625)), a disciple of the new scholarship, saw the first decisive adoption of Renaissance motifs in a free form communicated to England through German and Flemish carvers rather than directly from Italy. Although the general lines of Elizabethan design remained, there was a more consistent and unified application of formal design, both in plan and elevation. Much use was made of columns and pilasters, round-arch arcades, and flat roofs with openwork parapets. These and other classical elements appeared in a free and fanciful vernacular rather than with any true classical purity. With them were mixed the prismatic rustications and ornamental detail of scrolls, straps, and lozenges also characteristic of Elizabethan design. The style influenced furniture design and other decorative arts.\n\nReproductions of the Classical orders had already found their way into English architecture during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, frequently based upon John Shute's \"The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture\", published in 1563, with two other editions in 1579 and 1584. In 1577, three years before the commencement of Wollaton Hall, a copybook of the orders was brought out in Antwerp by Hans Vredeman de Vries. Although nominally based on the description of the orders by Vitruvius, the author indulged freely not only in his rendering of them, but in suggestions of his own, showing how the orders might be employed in various buildings. Those suggestions were of a most decadent type, so that even the author deemed it advisable to publish a letter from a canon of the Church, stating that there was nothing in his architectural designs that was contrary to religion. It is to publications of this kind that Jacobean architecture owes the perversion of its forms and the introduction of strap work and pierced crestings, which appear for the first time at Wollaton Hall (1580); at Bramshill House, Hampshire (1607–1612), and in Holland House, Kensington (1624), it receives its fullest development.\n\nHatfield House, built in its entirety by Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, between 1607 and 1611, is an example of the later extension of the Elizabethan prodigy house, with turreted Tudor-style wings at each end with their mullioned windows but the two wings linked by an Italianate Renaissance facade. This central facade, originally an open loggia, has been attributed to Inigo Jones himself; however, the central porch carries a heavier quasi-gatehouse emphasis, so the attribution is probably false. Inside the house, the elaborately carved staircase demonstrates the Renaissance influence on English ornament.\n\nOther Jacobean buildings of note are Crewe Hall, Cheshire; Hatfield House, Hertfordshire; Knole House, near Sevenoaks in Kent; Charlton House in Charlton, London; Holland House by John Thorpe; Plas Teg near Pontblyddyn, between Wrexham and Mold in Wales; Bank Hall in Bretherton; Castle Bromwich Hall near Solihull; and Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire.\n\nAlthough the term is generally employed of the style which prevailed in England during the first quarter of the 17th century, its peculiar decadent detail will be found nearly twenty years earlier at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, and in Oxford and Cambridge examples exist up to 1660, notwithstanding the introduction of the purer Italian style by Inigo Jones in 1619 at Whitehall.\n\nIn 1607 and 1620, England founded her first successful colonies: Jamestown, Virginia and Plymouth, Massachusetts. As with other settlers in the New World, the men and women that built the homes and buildings that formed the infrastructure of these towns and the others that followed over the coming century often built edifices that were consistent with Jacobean vernacular architecture in the portion of England that they originated from: for example, the clapboard common to houses in New England and later Nova Scotia to this day are derived from a local style of architecture popular in Northeast England in the early to mid 17th century. Historians often classify this architecture as a subtype of colonial American architecture, called First Period architecture, however there is an enormous amount of overlap between the architecture of the commoner class in early 17th century England and colonial America architecture, where some of the key features of the Jacobean era often outlived James I and VI owing to less contact between the American colonists and the fashions of England.\n\nWhen the Puritans arrived in the winter of 1620 in New England, there was very little time to waste owing to the bitterly cold weather and the fact that many of the occupants of the ship that brought them, the Mayflower, were very ill and needed to get into housing before circumstances could allow the diseases on board to spread further. Those that were still able bodied had to act quickly and as a result the first buildings of New England most resembled the wattle and daub cottages of the common people back home, especially of places like East Anglia and Devonshire, with the thatched roofs that remained common in England until the 1660s differing only in that the main material chosen for thatching was grass found in the local salt marshes. Most of these would have been hall and parlor dwellings with a simple central chimney, a feature of British architecture since the earlier Elizabethan era, a timber frame, a squat lower floor and an upper floor with bare beams and a space to be used for storage. Measurements of the archaeological remains of houses owned by Myles Standish and John Alden done in the mid nineteenth and the mid twentieth century in Duxbury, Massachusetts, a town across the harbor from Plymouth, also settled by the original Pilgrim Fathers, and inhabited just eight years later, reveal that the original homes were very narrow and small, averaging approximately forty feet long by fifteen feet wide. This concurs with the dimensions of houses that would have been found amongst the English commoner classes (specifically yeoman and small farmers) as evidenced by the surviving tax rolls of the Jacobean era.\n\nExamples of original Jacobean architecture in the Americas include Drax Hall Great House and St. Nicholas Abbey, both located in Barbados, and Bacon's Castle in Surry County, Virginia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052173", "title": "George Hirst", "text": "George Hirst\n\nGeorge Herbert Hirst (7 September 1871 – 10 May 1954) was a professional English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1891 and 1921, with a further appearance in 1929. One of the best all-rounders of his time, Hirst was a left arm medium-fast bowler and right-handed batsman. He played in 24 Test matches for England between 1897 and 1909, touring Australia twice. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season 14 times, the second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team-mate Wilfred Rhodes. One of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year for 1901, Hirst scored 36,356 runs and took 2,742 wickets in first-class cricket. In Tests, he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets.\n\nBorn in Kirkheaton, Hirst first achieved success for Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting improved at the expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He was one of the first bowlers to control the swing of the ball, which batsmen found very difficult to counter, making Hirst's bowling far more successful from then on.\n\nFrom 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire, and he may have suffered from playing in Australia where conditions did not suit him.\n\nHirst returned to play for Yorkshire after the war, but became a cricket coach at Eton College in 1920, where he remained until 1938. After making occasional appearances in 1920 and 1921, he retired from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connections with Yorkshire for the rest of his life, coached young players and established an excellent reputation for developing players of all social backgrounds. A popular player, coach, and personality with cricketers and spectators, Hirst died in 1954, aged 82.\n\nHirst was born on 7 September 1871 in the Brown Cow Inn, Kirkheaton, a village close to Huddersfield. He was the last of 10 children born to James Hirst and his wife Sarah Maria Woolhouse. When his father died in 1880, Hirst lived with his sister Mary Elizabeth Woolhouse and her husband John Berry in Kirkheaton. After leaving school at 10 years of age, Hirst first worked for a hand-loom weaver in a local cottage, and then at a dyeing firm. He played rugby football as a full back during winter, and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer. By the age of 15, Hirst was playing regularly for the Kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper. His reputation grew; when he was 18 he was a key player in the Kirkheaton team which won the Lumb Challenge Cup of 1889. In the final, watched by players from Yorkshire County Cricket Club, he took five wickets for 23 runs. Days later, invited to take part along with another local player, he appeared for Yorkshire against Cheshire in a non-first-class match in Huddersfield. He scored six runs in his only innings, and took three wickets in the match.\n\nHirst played only intermittently for Yorkshire over the next couple of seasons, but continued to develop as a cricketer, signing as a professional for Elland Cricket Club for the 1890 season before joining Mirfield in 1891. During that season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Somerset in the County Championship; he scored 15 runs and took two wickets in the game.\n\nFor the 1892 season, Hirst joined Huddersfield, which played a higher standard of cricket. Yorkshire also gave him a longer run in the first team. Early in the season, Hirst appeared for Yorkshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Not considered a good batsman at this stage, he batted at number 11 in the first innings, scored 20 and 43 not out and, as a bowler, took four wickets for 29 runs (four for 29) and two for 58. His bowling performance particularly impressed Sydney Pardon, the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". Yorkshire, needing to fill a vacant place in the team, played Hirst 13 times in first-class matches in 1892. He did not pass 30 runs in an innings again and averaged 16.15 with the bat. With the ball, he took 30 wickets at an average of 20.56 with a best performance of six for 16 against Sussex. \"Wisden\" later noted that Hirst, until he tired later in the season and was dropped from the team, \"bowled up to a certain point with excellent results\".\n\nOver the next few seasons, Hirst became a regular member of the Yorkshire side, but although his performances were good enough to keep him in the team, he had few outstanding successes. \"Wisden\" noted: \"For some time after his first season Hirst's career was one of steady progress rather than of brilliant achievement.\" Hirst's batting remained undeveloped in 1893; he batted at number 10 and did not pass fifty in any one innings, though he managed some useful scores. He averaged only 15.04 with the bat, but his bowling continued to make a good impression on critics. He took 99 wickets at an average of 14.39, placing him third in the Yorkshire averages for the season; that year, the county won the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890, for the first time. In 1894, Hirst scored his maiden first-class century against Gloucestershire, hitting an unbeaten 115 out of a partnership of 176 for the ninth wicket. Although this was his only score over fifty, \"Wisden\" recorded how his batting often helped his team out of difficult situations. In total, he hit 564 runs at an average of 16.58. With the ball, his record was similar to the previous season. He took 98 wickets at an average of 15.98, and his best figures came in a match against Lancashire, a feat appreciated by Yorkshire supporters as the fixture was always highly competitive. Then in the 1895 season, Hirst passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, securing 150 wickets at an average of 17.06. He established himself as an opening bowler for Yorkshire, assuming the role from Ted Wainwright and developing a good partnership with Bobby Peel. Against Leicestershire, he took a hat-trick. Although primarily regarded as a bowler, and while \"Wisden\" later described his batting as being in \"temporary decline\" in 1895, Hirst also scored 710 runs at an average of 19.18, with three fifties.\n\nIn 1896, Yorkshire won their second County Championship. Hirst hit a century against Leicestershire and nine other scores over fifty; this improvement in his batting took him past 1,000 runs for the first time, and his average of 28.05 was substantially higher than he had achieved previously. With the ball he took 104 wickets, at the more expensive average of 21.61, to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time. However, some critics in Yorkshire were unhappy that his batting had improved, believing that the extra effort involved would diminish his effectiveness as a bowler. They considered a powerful bowling attack to be vital to the team's success, more so than a strong batting line-up, and expressed the opinion that Hirst should concentrate on one discipline rather than dividing his energy. Over the next few seasons, these fears were proven to some extent, \"Wisden\" noting in 1901 that he was a less effective bowler than previously. In 1897, Hirst completed the double again. He scored 1,535 runs at an average of 35.69, with a century and 11 fifties, and took 101 wickets at an average of 23.22. These performances were good enough to earn him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen in the prestigious matches at The Oval and Lord's, in both of which he scored half-centuries.\n\nFor the winter of 1897–98, Hirst was selected as part of Andrew Stoddart's team to tour Australia. The team was outplayed and lost the Test matches 4–1, hampered by the poor form of the bowlers and ill health among the team, not least from Stoddart himself who missed several matches following the death of his mother. Hirst, suffering from a strained leg for some of the tour, was ineffective as a bowler. The hard Australian pitches favoured batsmen and did not suit Hirst's style of bowling. In all the first-class matches on the tour, he took only nine wickets at the very expensive average of 75.77. His batting was inconsistent and he scored 338 runs at an average of 21.12. His best scores came in minor matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for England in four of the five Test matches. His debut came in the first match, England's only victory, when he scored 62 batting at number six in the batting order. Despite bowling 41 overs in the game, he failed to take a wicket; his maiden Test match wicket came in the following Test, but he took only two wickets in the series. In the third Test, Hirst scored 85, which remained the highest Test score of his career, but in this series he reached double figures only once more. When the series ended, Hirst had scored 207 runs at an average of 29.57.\n\nHirst's poor form continued when he returned to England for the 1898 season. Fatigue from continuous cricket and ongoing problems with his leg added to his difficulties and he had a poor season. His only score over fifty was an innings of 130 against Surrey, and he scored 567 runs at an average of 17.71. Statistically, he had one of his worst bowling seasons, taking 36 wickets at 25.61 and never taking more than four wickets in an innings. For Yorkshire, Hirst's loss of form was offset by the debut of Wilfred Rhodes, also from Kirkheaton, who took 154 wickets in his first season. In 1899, Hirst showed a big improvement in his batting form, scoring 1,630 runs—his best tally to date—at an average of 35.43. He increased his number of wickets to 82 at 24.75, and his form was good enough to earn selection for his first home Test match, against Australia. However, it was only injuries to three other candidates that secured his place as a fast bowler, and he was not selected in the rest of the series. \"Wisden\" noted: \"It cannot be said that the experiment was in any way a success. Hirst worked hard for his side, his fielding indeed being perfection, but as a bowler he did not cause the Australians any trouble.\" When he played the tourists in their game against Yorkshire soon after the Test, Hirst took 13 wickets. Later in the season, he played for the Players against the Gentlemen, though without any great success.\n\nHirst's batting continued to be more successful than his bowling, to the point where commentators regarded him as primarily a batsman, who bowled occasionally. In 1900, he scored 1,960 runs at an average of 40.83, his best batting record to date, but his total of wickets fell to 62 at an average of 26.90, his worst average until 1914. His only representative cricket came in end-of-season festival matches, including a Gentlemen v Players match. Yorkshire won the County Championship, the first of three consecutive victories in which Hirst played a leading role. After his achievements in the season, Hirst was selected as one of \"Wisden's\" Cricketers of the Year. The citation described him as a confident batsman who could be relied upon in difficult batting conditions or when his team were under pressure, but noted how his bowling had suffered as he improved as a batsman. However, around this time, Hirst began to develop his use of swing bowling, known at the time as swerve bowling. Previously, the ball occasionally swung through the air without his deliberate intention after he released it, but he now discovered a method to control the \"swerve\" in certain atmospheric conditions. He never discussed how he achieved the effect, limiting his comments to \"sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nIn the 1901 season, Hirst's improvement in bowling brought him the highest total of wickets in his career to date. In a summer of sunny weather which brought a succession of good batting pitches, he took 183 wickets, the first time since 1897 he had passed 100 wickets, at an average of 16.38. This placed him second in the national averages behind Rhodes. He recorded a series of impressive bowling performances, winning extravagant praise from \"Wisden\"; he took five wickets in an innings on 15 occasions and 10 wickets in a match five times, including once against traditional rivals Lancashire. His batting continued to be successful, and he completed his second double with 1,950 runs at 42.39, including his first double-century: 214 against Worcestershire. He was selected for the Gentlemen and Players match at Lord's, and appeared in the equivalent fixture in an end-of-season festival match.\n\nAlthough both were invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia in the winter of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire committee wanted both players to be well rested before the new season. Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.\n\nDuring the summer of 1902, Australia toured England, playing five Test matches; Hirst made an impact on the series. Around the time of the first Test, the tourists endured a dispiriting spell of poor form and illness. In the first Test, England scored 376 for nine wickets. Hirst scored 48 and \"Wisden\" described his partnership with Johnny Tyldesley of 94 in 80 minutes as the turning point of the innings. In reply, Hirst and Rhodes bowled out Australia for 36 in conditions that the umpires considered reasonable to bat in. \"Wisden\" described the two Yorkshiremen as bowling very well. Hirst had figures of three for 15 and Rhodes returned seven for 17. However C. B. Fry, who played for England in the match, believed Hirst to be the more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they \"hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success. Well as Rhodes bowled, it was Hirst who was responsible for the debacle. This is the best instance I know of the bowler at the other end getting wickets for his colleague.\" The England side for this match was later described by some critics as the greatest England team in history. Rain prevented the match from being completed and saved Australia from almost certain defeat. The Australian team's next game was against Yorkshire. Hirst took four for 35 in the tourist's first innings, but in a low-scoring game, Yorkshire were behind after the first innings. After Australia had reached 20 for three wickets in their second innings, Hirst bowled Victor Trumper with what Hirst believed was the best delivery of his life and the tourists last wickets fell quickly. The team were bowled out for 23, of which Hirst took five wickets for nine runs as he made the ball swing. Yorkshire lost five wickets in scoring the 48 runs they required to win.\n\nThe second Test was badly affected by weather and Hirst did not bat or bowl, and in the third Test in Sheffield, lost by England, he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets. Although he failed at Sheffield, Hirst was the leading all-rounder in England and thus unlikely to be left out of the team. However, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was engaged in a dispute with the team selectors over the composition of his side. He was given only 12 players to choose from for the fourth Test. Fred Tate was one of the twelve and the selectors probably included him as they believed MacLaren could not possibly choose him in the final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field the side they wanted. MacLaren responded by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of anger towards the selectors. The pitch was soft, which would have favoured the bowling of Tate, but \"Wisden\" reported that while this offered some justification for dropping Hirst, \"it meant playing a bowler pure and simple in preference to a first-rate all-round man, and the result proved anything but happy.\" Tate bowled just 16 overs in the game, dropped a vital catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the series; later writers claimed that Tate's performance was responsible for losing the match.\n\nHirst was recalled for the final Test and played a vital role. \"Wisden\" said that he bowled as well as he had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse. Although Australia recovered, he had figures of five for 77. With Len Braund, Hirst then helped England to avoid the follow-on, scoring 43 and according to \"Wisden\" \"hitting with the utmost freedom\". Hirst took a further wicket as Australia were dismissed for 121. England, needing 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from Gilbert Jessop gave England a chance. Hirst scored 58 not out, making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in the later stages of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, \"We'll get 'em in singles\", but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket victory. \"Wisden\" described Hirst as playing \"a great game\", noted the coolness of his play under pressure and said that \"Hirst's innings was in its way almost as remarkable as Jessop's\".\n\nIn four Tests, Hirst scored 157 runs at an average of 39.25 and took nine wickets at an average of 23.11. Apart from his Test appearances, Hirst also played twice for the Players against the Gentlemen and played for the same side against the Australians.\n\nEarly in the 1903 season, Hirst suffered a leg injury. This, coupled with other players' absences, was partly responsible for a poor start to the season by Yorkshire, and although the team recovered, it could only achieve third place in the County Championship. When Hirst returned his bowling speed was reduced, but during the season he rediscovered his swing bowling. In completing the first of 10 consecutive doubles, he took 128 wickets at an average of 14.94 and scored 1,844 runs at an average of 47.28. For Yorkshire, he topped both the batting and bowling averages and had the third highest batting average in the country. Hirst played in two end-of-season games for the Players against the Gentlemen; his 124 not out in the second match was his only century in the Players versus Gentlemen series.\n\nIn 1903, Pelham Warner, who played for Middlesex, was chosen to captain the first tour of Australia to be sponsored by MCC, in the winter of 1903–04. According to Warner, Hirst and Rhodes were the first two players to be selected, as \"the two best bowlers of the present day in this country\". Before the tour, critics claimed Hirst would be unsuccessful, citing his failure during his previous tour. However, Warner later wrote: \"Hirst, to say nothing of his batting, bowled excellently throughout the tour, and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest\". He further described him as the best all-rounder in England and noted that \"the tighter the match, the better he plays\". \"Wisden\" was less convinced, and the report on the tour said that, as a bowler, \"Hirst, though by no means the failure he had been with Mr Stoddart's team six years before, fell far below his English form.\" While commenting on his batting record, the \"Wisden\" report noted: \"The Australian wickets [i.e. pitches] in fine weather are rather too fast to suit the pulling and hook strokes of which he is such a master in England.\" As he could not make the ball swing in Australia in the same way it did in England, Hirst used leg theory, bowling at leg stump with fielders close by on the leg side.\n\nIn his second match of the tour, Hirst scored 92 and used his pull shot more effectively than on other occasions. He followed this with 66 in the third match but did not take many wickets before the first Test. Warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in the hot conditions; his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells. Hirst played in all five Test matches, the first two of which were won by England. In the first game, Hirst took two wickets. In his first innings, he scored a duck and was dropped by Frank Laver before he had scored in the second. He survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with Tom Hayward guided England to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194. Hirst scored 11 runs in the second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch, badly affected by rain. Although this performance was not statistically impressive, Warner thought he bowled very well. During the third Test, Hirst took three wickets and, with innings of 58 and 44, was one of the few successful England batsmen in a poor performance which enabled Australia to win the match. England won the crucial fourth match to ensure the series victory. Hirst took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18. Australia achieved a win in the final match in which Hirst scored 0 and 1, but after taking no wickets in the first innings he achieved his best Test figures of the tour in the second, with five for 48.\n\nIn the Test series, Hirst scored 217 runs at an average of 24.11 and took 15 wickets at an average of 30.06. He scored 569 runs at 33.47 and took 36 wickets at 24.50 over all first-class games on the tour. His best bowling performance was five for 37 against Tasmania. Warner described Hirst as a very consistent batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.\n\nAfter returning to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904. Although a leg injury reduced the pace and effectiveness of his bowling for much of the season, he scored 2,501 runs at an average of 54.36, the highest aggregate and average of his career, and took 132 wickets at 21.09. He became the first Yorkshire player to achieve the double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, a feat previously achieved only by the Gloucestershire trio of W. G. Grace, Charlie Townsend and Gilbert Jessop. Most of his eight centuries were either against the strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for the team. In August, Hirst had a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £3,703, worth around £ as of , a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity was reflected in the attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.\n\nYorkshire finished second to Lancashire in the County Championship in 1904 but regained the title in 1905. Hirst's leg-strain continued to cause him pain throughout the season and again hampered his bowling. Even so, he took 110 wickets at 19.94 and passed 2,000 runs for the second time, scoring 2,226 runs at an average of 53.95. Early in the season, Hirst scored 341 against Leicestershire, the highest score of his career and, as of 2015, the record individual innings by a Yorkshire batsman. On a good pitch for batting, he began his innings when Yorkshire had scored 22 for three wickets, in reply to Leicestershire's score of 419, batted just under seven hours and hit 53 fours and a six. Later that season, he scored another double century, hitting 232 not out against Surrey; only two other players reached double figures in the Yorkshire innings. In the same game, Hirst took five wickets for 43 runs.\n\nHirst's leg injury kept him out of the England side for the first two Test matches against Australia, although he would have been a certain selection had he been fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate Stanley Jackson, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.\n\nIn 1906, Hirst completed an unprecedented double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Cricket writer A. A. Thomson noted that both milestones were unusual individually, and that such all-round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of W. G. Grace in the 1870s. No other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double. Hirst reached the 1,000 run–100 wicket double by the end of June, two weeks faster than anyone else in the history of first-class cricket. In total he scored 2,385 first-class runs at an average of 45.86 and took 208 wickets at 16.50. Hirst's contributions were particularly important in a close race for the County Championship. Kent were eventual champions after Yorkshire lost a close game to Gloucestershire, but Hirst performed well in the two matches against Kent. He scored a century and took 11 wickets as Yorkshire won the first, and took eight wickets and scored a match-saving 93 in the drawn second encounter. Against the other title contenders, Lancashire and Surrey, he was likewise successful with both bat and ball, earning praise from \"The Times\" and \"Wisden\" for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches. His captain, Lord Hawke, said \"It was not only what Georgie Hirst did but how he did it, coming off [i. e. \"succeeding\"] when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against the more formidable sides.\" He scored six centuries, two of which came in a record-equalling performance against Somerset. He scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with the ball. He became only the second man after Bernard Bosanquet to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same first-class match; as of 2015, only one other man, Franklyn Stephenson in 1988, has achieved the feat. Battling a knee injury and exhaustion towards the end of the season, it became increasingly difficult for Hirst to perform. Hirst took his 200th wicket at the end of August and commented that, were his feat to be duplicated in future, \"whoever does will be very tired\". He also commented that his injuries only troubled him once the season was over and it \"was a triumph of spirit over matter\".\n\nThe weather was poor during the 1907 season, resulting in a succession of pitches which suited spin bowling and were difficult to bat on. In these circumstances, Hirst scored fewer runs than in the previous season. He did not score a century, making 1,321 runs at 28.71, and the prevalent type of pitches did not suit his bowling pace so that he took fewer wickets. Even so, he was the second highest wicket-taker in the season and came fifth in the bowling averages, with 183 wickets at 15.29. Hirst remained a first-choice member of the Test team, playing all three matches against South Africa that summer in a series which England won 1–0, with the other two games drawn. Although unsuccessful with the bat, achieving 46 runs in five innings with a top-score of 17, in a low-scoring second Test, Hirst was one of the few batsmen to handle the googlies of Aubrey Faulkner. As a bowler he took 10 wickets at 18.50; of these wickets, six were in the final match of the series. Yorkshire won the County Championship again during the 1908 season. Hirst completed another double, scoring 1,598 runs at 38.97 and taking 174 wickets at 14.05, but was not selected for any other representative games until the end of the season. However, he declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC team in 1907–08.\n\nIn the 1909 season, Hirst was less successful. Possibly affected by his heavy workload with bat and ball in previous seasons, his batting disappointed critics. He scored 1,256 runs at 27.30, his lowest batting average since 1898. With the ball, he took 115 wickets at 20.05; his best performances came in the more important matches such as those against Lancashire and Surrey. He was selected for the Players against the Gentlemen, taking seven wickets in the game. In the Test series against Australia, which England lost 2–1, Hirst played in the first four matches. England won the first game, in which Hirst took nine wickets. On the first day, bowling throughout the Australian innings with Colin Blythe, Hirst took four for 28. The Australians were never comfortable; \"Wisden\" noted that Hirst \"[made] the ball swerve in his most puzzling fashion\". After England established a first innings lead, Australia were bowled out for 151 in their second innings, with Hirst taking five for 58. The English opening batsmen scored the 105 runs required for victory without being separated. Hirst and Blythe took all the wickets which fell to England in the match, a rare accomplishment, and apart from a brief period, bowled throughout the match without resting. However, Hirst was ineffective in the rest of the series, and was left out of the side for the fifth and final Test. In the series he scored 52 runs at an average of 8.66, with a top-score of 31, and took 16 wickets at 21.75. This ended his Test career; his final Test record in 24 matches was 790 runs, with three scores over fifty, at an average of 22.57, and 59 wickets at an average of 30.00.\n\nYorkshire had one of their worst seasons to date in 1910, finishing eighth in the County Championship and attracting disapproval from critics. Hirst led the Yorkshire batting and bowling averages and was the third highest wicket-taker in the country. He scored 1,840 runs at 32.85 and took 164 wickets at 14.79. One of his best performances came at Lord's, where he scored an unbeaten century to guide Yorkshire to a win against Middlesex. Against Lancashire he took nine for 23, the best bowling figures of his career, clean-bowling eight of his victims as Lancashire were dismissed for 61. Yorkshire continued to struggle in 1911, but Hirst was successful against many of the leading counties, mainly as a bowler. However, he achieved some large scores; against Sussex, he hit the third double-century of his career and against Lancashire he scored 156 as well as taking six wickets for 83. In total, he scored 1,789 runs at 33.12 and took 137 wickets at 20.40. In 1912 Yorkshire regained the County Championship; Hirst's form that season was not as good as in previous years, but he batted well before poor weather and a knee injury interrupted his cricket. He hit one century and his performances with the ball were unspectacular. In all he scored 1,133 runs at an average of 25.75 and took 118 wickets at 17.37. Although both Australia and South Africa toured England, Hirst did not play any Tests and, for the first time since 1904, was not selected for the Players side in any of their matches.\n\nHirst completed the 14th and final double of his career in 1913, leading the Yorkshire batting averages with 1,540 runs at an average of 35.81. His bowling was not as effective and he was no longer Yorkshire's main attacking bowler, as Alonzo Drake and Major Booth headed the averages. Hirst took 101 wickets at 20.13. During the following season, the last before the First World War, Hirst was further afflicted by injuries and missed some matches. He bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets, which cost 29.81, were his fewest since 1898; it was the first time since 1902 he failed to complete the double. His batting remained effective and he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances, although his two centuries were against the weaker bowling attacks of Northamptonshire and Somerset. He scored 1,670 runs at 41.75. In June, he was selected in a match to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the current Lord's ground, playing for the Rest of England against the MCC side which had toured South Africa the previous winter. The outbreak of war brought the season to an early close in August.\n\nDuring the war Hirst, along with Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, worked in a munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on a certain number of Saturdays. Hirst played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers for accepting minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in the first two weeks of the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.\n\nHirst played three more first-class games; in 1921–22 he played two games for the Europeans cricket team in India, and in 1929, aged 58, he made a final appearance for Yorkshire in a Scarborough Festival match against the MCC. He scored just one run before Bill Bowes bowled him; Hirst reportedly commented: \"A grand ball that, lad. I couldn't have played that one when I was good.\" In all first-class cricket, Hirst played 826 games, scored 36,356 runs at an average of 34.13 with 60 hundreds and took 2,742 wickets at 18.73.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Hirst occasionally umpired first-class matches, taking charge of at least one match at every Scarborough Festival between 1922 and 1938. He also umpired two matches on Yorkshire's tour of Jamaica in 1936, and a Minor Counties match between Yorkshire and Lancashire second teams.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1938, Hirst was the cricket coach at Eton. The college's most important match was the annual match against Harrow at Lord's, and during Hirst's tenure, the team were unbeaten in the fixture, winning the six matches that produced a definite result and drawing the remainder. Following Hirst's retirement, Eton lost to Harrow in 1939 for the first time since the First World War. In the period of Hirst's coaching, Eton only lost once—in 1920—to Winchester. A combination of Hirst's technical knowledge, playing experience and empathy with young people made him a very successful coach. He taught technical proficiency, but encouraged his pupils to play their natural game. His \"Times\" obituary noted \"his professional capacity earned him the respect of the boys and his natural good humour and good manners gained him the love of all.\" When he retired, a dinner was held in his honour at Eton.\n\nWhile serving as the Eton coach, Hirst also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and maintained his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite the differences in the backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay to the point where he became a key member of the Yorkshire team.\n\nBill Bowes, who received coaching by Hirst and went on to play for England, described him as \"the finest coach in the world\". Len Hutton, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote \"I shall always think of George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of every young fellow who has had a trial under him\". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge in a way that was easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how \"he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies\".\n\nHirst received little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, he was often at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, making it difficult to place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.\n\nAlthough Hirst was a right-handed batsman, he bowled with his left arm at medium-fast pace. He was one of the first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as Bernard Bosanquet's invention of the googly. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball swing in every match, nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. Sammy Woods described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: \"How the devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?\" Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, a little faster than medium pace, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over mid on. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often rubbed the ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's \"Wisden\" obituary records: \"Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling.\"\n\nHirst completed the double 14 times, more than any other cricketer except Rhodes. Unusually for an all-rounder, for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler. Consequently, he was a key member of the Yorkshire team. His Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke described Hirst as \"the greatest county cricketer of all time\", and journalist Jim Kilburn noted that no cricketer could \"capture the heart and the imagination and the affections more firmly than George Herbert Hirst\". E. W. Swanton described his typical style of play as \"grafting for victory without heroics\". His record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket, owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of Australia which reduced the effectiveness of his bowling and batting.\n\nHirst gave the impression of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile \"went right round his head and met at the back\". Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's \"Times\" obituary said: \"No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of \"Wisden\" can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, and he was one of the most illustrious of his time.\" Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as \"George Herbert\", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: \"He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it.\"\n\nA plain-speaking man, Hirst could be firm and even outspoken at times. \"Wisden\" said: \"Cricket was George Hirst's life\". Bowes wrote that Hirst \"was loved as a player, he was worshipped as a coach, revered as a man. His friends numbered thousands. He gave his full life to cricket; cricket gave a full life to him.\" Bowes also commented: \"I never hope to meet a better coach or a better man.\"\n\nOn 1 January 1896, Hirst married Emma Kilner in Kirkheaton; James, their first child, was born on 6 October of the same year. A second child, Annie, followed in December 1899, and a third, Molly, in April 1906. The family first lived in Kirkheaton but later moved to Marsh, a more affluent area of Huddersfield. In his later years, Hirst's health declined and he spent time in a nursing home. His wife died in 1953; twelve months later, on 10 May 1954, Hirst died, aged 82. He was cremated at Lawnswood Crematorium, Leeds.\n\n"}

Designed in the early 1960s for the American Broadcasting Company's five owned-and-operated stations (all of which broadcast on VHF channel 7), the logo, or a version of it, is currently being used not only by ABC stations and affiliates, but also by a number of television broadcasters around the world.\n\nThe Circle 7 logo was created by G. Dean Smith, a San Francisco graphic designer, and was first used in 1962 by ABC as the logo for its (then) five owned-and-operated television stations: WABC-TV in New York City; KABC-TV in Los Angeles; WBKB (now WLS-TV) in Chicago; KGO-TV in San Francisco; and WXYZ-TV in Detroit. When ABC applied for television station licenses in the late 1940s, it was thought that the low-band channel frequencies (2 through 6) would be removed from use for television broadcasting, thus making these five stations broadcasting on VHF channel 7 the lowest on the television dial. American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, ABC's then-corporate parent, registered the Circle 7 logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1962.\n\nWhen WABC-TV adopted the \"Eyewitness News\" format in 1968, all reporters and anchors were required to wear a blazer with a \"Circle 7\" patch (a lapel pin in later years) when they appeared on the air – a marketing practice that spread to the other ABC O&Os, and eventually to other ABC affiliates. Stations commonly used the logo on microphone flags, newscaster clothing and design of sets, as well as on-air graphics for locally originated programming.\n\nWZVN is operated through an LMA by Waterman Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\n\n"}

It is native to Southeast Asia but elsewhere is cultivated in gardens as an annual. It has been naturalized in the southern United States and the New World tropics. In its native environment it is grown in higher areas where rice and corn do not grow well. Other common names include coixseed, tear grass and Yi Yi (from Chinese 薏苡 \"yìyǐ\"). Job's tears are also commonly sold as Chinese pearl barley in Asian supermarkets, although \"C. lacryma-jobi\" is not closely related to barley (\"Hordeum vulgare\").\n\nThere are two main varieties of the species, one wild and one cultivated. The wild variety, \"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"lacryma-jobi\", has hard-shelled pseudocarps—very hard, pearly white, oval structures used as beads for making rosaries, necklaces, and other objects. The cultivated variety \"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"ma-yuen\" is harvested as a cereal crop, has a soft shell, and is used medicinally in parts of Asia.\n\nThe species was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 with the epithet as a Latin translation of the metaphorical \"tear of Job\". , four varieties are accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families:\n\n\nBesides the use for ornamental purposes, Job's tears grains are useful as a source of food (cereals) and folk medicine.\n\nThroughout East Asia, Job's tears are available in dried form and cooked as a grain. The grains are generally spherical, with a groove on one end, and polished white in color, though in Japan unpolished \"yuuki hatomugi\", which is unpolished and brown in color, is also available.\n\nIn Korea, a thick drink called \"yulmu cha\" (율무차, literally \"Job's tears tea\") is made from powdered Job's tears. A similar drink, called \"yi ren jiang \" (薏仁漿), also appears in Chinese cuisine, and is made by simmering whole polished Job's tears in water and sweetening the resulting thin, cloudy liquid with sugar. The grains are usually strained from the liquid but may also be consumed separately or together.\n\nIn both Korea and China, distilled liquors are also made from the grain. One such example is the Korean liquor called \"okroju\" (옥로주; hanja: 玉露酒), which is made from rice and Job's tears. An ancient Chinese beer recipe included the grain as an ingredient. In Japan, an aged vinegar is made from the grain.\n\nIn southern Vietnam, a sweet, cold soup called \"sâm bổ lượng\" has Job's tears as one of its ingredients. This dish derives from the southern Chinese \"tong sui\" called \"qīng bǔ liáng\" (清補涼; Cantonese: ching1 bou2 leung4).\n\nIn Cambodia, where it is known as \"skuay\" (ស្គួយ), it is used both as part of herbal medicine and as an ingredient in desserts.\n\nIn Thailand, it is often consumed in teas and other drinks, such as soy milk.\n\nIt is also used alongside other herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. Particularly \"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"ma-yuen\" has been used in the traditional Chinese medicine to invigorate the spleen function and promote urination, alleviate arthritis, arrest diarrhea, remove heat and facilitate the drainage of pus.\n\nIn both the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, the beads of Job's tears are called \"corn beads\" or \"Cherokee corn beads\" and have been used for personal adornment.\n\n"}

The screenplay, written by Nora Ephron, is based on her novel of the same name, a semi-biographical account of her marriage to Carl Bernstein.\n\nThe song \"Coming Around Again\" was performed and written by Carly Simon, and became one of her \"Billboard\" hits, reaching #18 on the Hot 100 and #5 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The film was released in the United States on July 25, 1986.\n\nManhattan food writer Rachel Samstat and Washington, D.C. political columnist Mark Forman meet at a mutual friend's wedding. Both have been married before and Mark has a reputation for being a serial womanizer. After a whirlwind courtship, the two marry, despite Rachel's reservations. They purchase a dilapidated Georgetown townhouse and Rachel struggles to adapt to being a wife in Washington's political high society. The ongoing renovations of their house create some stress in Mark and Rachel's marriage, but they are brought closer together when Rachel discovers she is pregnant. Rachel experiences a difficult labor in which the baby's life is briefly threatened, but she gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Annie.\n\nSoon after, Rachel discovers evidence of Mark's extramarital affair with socialite Thelma Rice during her pregnancy with her second child. She leaves him and takes their daughter to New York, where she moves in with her father and gets her job back as a food writer. Although she insists that she has left him for good, Rachel is dismayed when he fails to call her after several days. She inadvertently leads a burglar to a group therapy session she is attending in her therapist's apartment; he robs the group and takes Rachel's wedding ring. Just after, Mark arrives and asks her to come back, insisting he will never see Thelma again.\n\nRachel gives birth to their second child, but struggles to fully forgive Mark. She spreads a nasty rumor about Thelma having Chlamydia but is caught out by Mark. The New York police return Rachel's wedding ring after they catch the burglar. When she takes it to the jeweler's to get the stone tightened, she discovers that Mark has bought a very expensive necklace, which coincides with Thelma's birthday. Realizing that he has returned to the affair, Rachel sells her wedding ring and leaves with both her children for New York, this time for good.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia. Jack Nicholson replaced Mandy Patinkin after a day of shooting. Nora Ephron's screenplay is based on her 1983 autobiographical novel of the same name, and inspired by her tempestuous second marriage to Carl Bernstein and his affair with Margaret Jay, the daughter of former British Prime Minister James Callaghan.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Carly Simon. Her songs, \"Coming Around Again\" and \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\", are included in the 1987 Grammy nominated album \"Coming Around Again\".\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called it \"a bitter, sour movie about two people who are only marginally interesting\" and placed much of the blame on screenwriter Nora Ephron, who \"should have based her story on somebody else's marriage. That way, she could have provided the distance and perspective that good comedy needs.\" He felt \"she apparently had too much anger to transform the facts into entertaining fiction.\"\n\n\"Variety\" thought it was \"a beautifully crafted film with flawless performances and many splendid moments, yet the overall effect is a bit disappointing\" and added, \"While the day-to-day details are drawn with a striking clarity, Ephron's script never goes much beyond the mannerisms of middle-class life. Even with the sketchy background information, it's hard to tell what these people are feeling or what they want.\"\n\nPauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" wrote: \"The movie is full of talented people, who [...] are fun to watch, but after a while the scenes that don't point anywhere begin to add up, and you start asking yourself: 'What is this movie about?' You are still asking when it's over, and by then a flatness, a disappointment, is likely to have settled over the fillips you'd enjoyed,\" noting that \"[t]hough Ephron is a gifted and a witty light essayist, her novel is no more than a variant of a princess fantasy: Rachel, the wife, is blameless; Mark, the husband, is simply a bad egg—an adulterer. And, reading the book, you don't have to take Rachel the bratty narrator very seriously; her self-pity is so thinly masked by humor and unabashed mean-spiritedness that you feel that the author is exploiting her life—trashing it by presenting it as a juicy, fast-action comic strip about a marriage of celebrities.\"\n\nLeonard Maltin gave the film three stars out of a possible four, and wrote \"Lightweight, superficial story is supercharged by two charismatic stars, who make it a must see.\"\n\nThe film opened in 843 theaters in the United States on July 25, 1986, and earned $5,783,079 during its opening weekend, ranking number two at the box office behind \"Aliens\".

Ron Popeil founded the company in 1964, and infomercials and commercials for the company's products soon became pervasive and memorable, in part thanks to Popeil's personal sales pitches. The names \"Ronco\" and \"Popeil\" and the suffix \"-O-Matic\" (used in many early product names) became icons of American popular culture and were often referred to by comedians introducing fictional gadgets, and As-Seen-On-TV parodies.\n\nRon Popeil was inspired to start the company by the open market hustling he saw on Maxwell Street during his youth. In the beginning, the company chiefly sold inventions developed by Popeil's father, Samuel \"S.J.\" Popeil. Products include the Veg-O-Matic and the Popeil Pocket Fisherman, a product manufactured by S.J. Popeil's company. During the 1970s, Ron Popeil began developing products on his own to sell through Ronco.\n\nIn August, 2005, Popeil announced his sale of the company to Fi-Tek VII, a Denver holding company, for $55 million. He was expected to continue working with the company as spokesman and product developer, but sold the company in order to have more time with his family. Fi-Tek VII changed its name to Ronco, and maintained the right of first look for Popeil's future inventions.\n\nRonco still held the trademark on the phrase \"set it and forget it\", used in the commercials for the Showtime Rotisserie Grill (and \"Household goods, namely, rotisseries, electric food dehydrators and structural parts therefor, namely, dehydrator trays and screens\"). The phrase has gone on to be used in popular culture.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Ronco filed Chapter 11 in U.S. bankruptcy court. Paperwork filed showed that Ronco creditors, the largest of which was Popeil himself, were owed US$32.7 million.\n\nIn 2011, CD3 Holdings, Inc., a consumer products company, acquired Ronco.\n\nOn April 27, 2018, Ronco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, seeking time to reorganize after failing to secure funding.\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Ronco changed its bankruptcy filing from Chapter 11 (reorganization) to Chapter 7, full liquidation and shutdown.\n\nRonco is known for a wide range of products marketed and in some cases invented by Ron Popeil. Among them are:\n\n\n\nRonco, like its rival K-tel, is also known as a record label, mostly issuing compilation albums created for TV advertising and licensed from the major record labels. In the United Kingdom, its first album was \"20 Star Tracks\", released in 1972. It issued three albums that reached No. 1 on the UK album charts: the \"That'll Be the Day\" soundtrack in 1973, which was removed from the UK charts after six consecutive weeks at No. 1, as TV-advertised compilations were banned from the chart; \"Disco Daze and Disco Nites\" in 1981; and \"Raiders of the Pop Charts\", released at the end of 1982, topping the chart in 1983.

The company's origins can be traced to Canadian Breweries, which bought the Carling Brewery in 1930 and the O'Keefe Brewery in 1934. Canadian Breweries purchased numerous other brewers – some to shut down, and some solely for their brands. In 1969, Canadian Breweries was acquired by a subsidiary of Rothmans, which renamed the company as Carling O'Keefe in 1973. The company was sold in 1987, then merged with Molson in 1989.\n\nIn 1840, Thomas Carling began a small brewing operation in London, Ontario, selling beer to soldiers at the local military camp. When he died, his sons William and John took over, naming it the W & J Carling Brewing Co. John Carling became a prominent figure in Canadian business and politics; he was knighted in 1893 and died in 1911. The Carling brewery then changed hands several times. In 1930, the Carling company was merged into the Brewing Corporation of Ontario, founded by E. P. Taylor.\n\nEugene O'Keefe, a banker, purchased the Hannath & Hart Brewery in 1862. By 1864, one of his partners had died, while the other (Patrick Cosgrave) left to found his own brewery. The business was renamed O'Keefe and Company. It was the first to produce lager beer in Canada, along with the traditional ale and porter. In 1891, the company was incorporated as O'Keefe Brewing Company Limited. In 1911 another new brewery was built with an annual capacity of 500,000 barrels. O'Keefe was one of the first to use trucks for beer delivery, the first to build a mechanically refrigerated warehouse, and one of the first to advertise extensively.\n\nO'Keefe died in 1913. The company became owned by a holding company, O'Keefe Limited, controlled by Sir Henry Pellatt, Sir William Mulock and Charles Vance Millar, who served as its president until his death in 1926. O'Keefe House is the former mansion owned by Eugene O'Keefe in Toronto. It now serves as a residence for Ryerson University. The O'Keefe brewery facility was located at Victoria and Gould streets, just east of Yonge Street. It was sold to Ryerson in 1996. The brewery was demolished and used as a parking lot for several decades. The site is now part of a mixed-use development, including a movie theatre used as lecture rooms by Ryerson, a parking garage and the Ryerson book store. Other O'Keefe buildings on the east side of Victoria were converted for Ryerson's use.\n\nE. P. Taylor began forming Canadian Breweries Limited (CBL) in 1930, beginning with Brading Brewery of Ottawa and Kuntz Brewery of Kitchener. Carling was merged into the-then Brewing Corporation of Ontario later that year. O'Keefe was one of the major targets, but the acquisition was not completed until 1934. Canadian Breweries Limited was a conglomerate, having purchased about 30 breweries. Some of the original brand names stayed in use during this time. The company closed some breweries, reducing its number of brands to just six in 1959. It also expanded into the United States, starting with a Carling Brewery in Cleveland, Ohio in 1934. By 1971, it had seven breweries in the United States. In the UK, it first licensed the production of Carling Black Label in 1952 to Hope & Anchor. Along with Hope & Anchor, CBL built a national brewing group starting in the late 1950s, developing Northern Breweries and Charrington United Breweries.\n\nTaylor resigned as chairman of CBL in 1966, and CBL was sold to Rothmans of Pall Mall Canada in 1969. Under Rothmans, it began a period of consolidation and cutting costs. It closed breweries in Ottawa, Quebec and Cleveland. Faced with declining sales and profits, it renamed itself Carling O'Keefe in 1973.\n\nAs a new venture, Carling O'Keefe began making Carlsberg and distributing Tuborg in 1973. The company continued the acquisitions of the Taylor era. The company bought two more brewers: Doran's of Northern Ontario, and National Brewing of the US.\n\nIn 1981, Carling O'Keefe, responding to the entry of Budweiser by Labatt's, licensed Miller High Life beer for production in Canada. The beer, unlike its other beers was not sold in the \"stubby\" bottle, instead, it was sold in the long-neck clear bottle. This began the decline of the stubby, which was phased out in the 1980s.\n\nCarling O'Keefe was bought by Elders IXL of Australia in 1987. Carling O'Keefe began bottling Elders' Foster's Lager. Carling O'Keefe merged with Molson Brewery to form Molson Breweries Canada in 1989. At the time of the merger, Molson was the second-largest Canadian brewing company, while Carling O'Keefe was third. The merger put the combined company ahead of former market leader Labatt's and made it the sixth-largest North America brewery. Seven Canadian plants were closed due to consolidation. Molson would later add US brewer Miller Brewing as a minority partner, then buy out Elders and Miller. In 2005, Molson merged with Coors to form Molson Coors Brewing Company. \n\nCarling brands are currently owned by the Molson Coors Brewing Company. Carling O'Keefe's Toronto location on Carlingview Drive (named for the brewery) is now a Molson brewery.\n\nCarling O'Keefe was a major supporter of Langley Speedway, a 3/8th-mile paved stock car oval, in Langley, British Columbia. They often sponsored races and season points championships. For example, Tom Berrow was the 1976 Carling O'Keefe Super Stock Points Champion. Their Company name was painted on the front stretch of the track and was part of the \"Winner's Circle\" celebration.\n\nIn 1974, Carling USA sponsored a NASCAR car driven by Canadian short track driver Earl Ross and owned by former NASCAR driver Junior Johnson in the Winston Cup Series. Over the course of the season, Ross earned four top fives, nine top tens, and a single win at Martinsville Speedway en route to a ninth-place finish in the points standings.\n\nIn 1976, Carling O'Keefe became a minority partner in the Toronto Argonauts professional football team. They would remain as owners or minority owners until 1991. Carling O'Keefe also held ownership of the NHL's Quebec Nordiques. Both franchises were sold due to the impending merger with Molson. The company, however, maintained promotional interests in both teams. In addition, during the 1980s, Carling O'Keefe was a chief sponsor for the CFL game telecasts on both the CBC and CTV (and, when CTV ceased broadcasting the CFL after 1986, the league-operated Canadian Football Network) networks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.849, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission, this star is located at a distance of approximately from the Sun.\n\nGamma Aquarii is the primary or 'A' component of a double star designated WDS J22217-0123. The secondary or 'B' component is UCAC2 31430071. Gamma Aquarii A's two components are therefore designated WDS J22217-0123 Aa and Ab. Gamma Aquarii is traditionally also called Sadachbia , a name now formally restricted to γ Aqr Aa.\n\n\"γ Aquarii\" (Latinised to \"Gamma Aquarii\") is the system's Bayer designation. WDS J22217-0123 A is its designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog.\n\nIt bore the traditional name \"Sadachbia\", from an Arabic expression سعد الأخبية (\"sa‘d al-’axbiyah\"), meaning \"luck of the homes (tents)\". In Hindi it is also called \"Satabhishaj\" (a hundred physicians); it is called \"Sadhayam\" in Tamil. In the catalogue of stars in the \"Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket\", this star was designated \"Aoul al Achbiya\" (\"أول ألأجبية\" - \"awwil al ahbiyah\"), which was translated into Latin as \"Prima Tabernaculorum\", meaning \"the first of luck of the homes (tents)\". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name \"Sadachbia\" for the component WDS J22217-0123 Aa on 21 August 2016, and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\n\nThis star, along with Pi Aquarii (Seat), Zeta Aquarii (Sadaltager / Achr al Achbiya) and Eta Aquarii (Hydria), were \"al Aḣbiyah\" الأخبية \"the Tent\".\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Tomb\", refers to an asterism consisting of Gamma Aquarii, Zeta Aquarii, Eta Aquarii and Pi Aquarii. Consequently, the Chinese name for Gamma Aquarii itself is (, ).\n\nGamma Aquarii is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 58.1 days.\n\nIt presents as an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 V, around two and a half times more massive than the Sun. It is a candidate Lambda Boötis star, suggesting it may have accreted low-metallicity circumstellar gas some time in the past. It is spinning relatively rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of . This value gives a lower bound on the actual azimuthal velocity along the star's equator. The outer atmosphere of Gamma Aquarii is radiating energy at an effective temperature of 10,500 K, which is nearly double the temperature at the surface of the Sun. This heat is what gives Gamma Aquarii the white-hot glow of an A-type star.\n\n"}

The band formed during the summer of 1992. Between 1992 and 1997, they released two full-length albums, three EPs and several singles.\n\nUnder the original moniker of \"Chupa,\" the band's founding members were Mary Lou Lord; Jason Hatfield, Juliana Hatfield's brother; Shawn King Devlin; and Brian Dunton. Devlin and Dunton were both also in the band Dumptruck before founding Helium. Mary Timony, formerly of the band Autoclave, replaced Mary Lou Lord on vocals and guitar shortly after formation, as Lord was reluctant to use electric instrumentation. Following Lord's departure, the remaining members changed the band's name to Helium.\n\nTimony was known for her husky, vibrato-less and monotone singing style. The band's record label, Matador Records, likened Timony's vocals to Kim Wilde and Debbie Harry.\n\nTheir first release was a 7\" single entitled \"The American Jean\" (1993), which was followed by the 7\" \"Hole in the Ground\". They released their first EP, \"Pirate Prude\", in 1994. Shortly after the release of \"Pirate Prude\", Dunton left the band and Polvo guitarist Ash Bowie, boyfriend of Timony at the time, joined on bass. In 1995, they released their first full-length release, \"The Dirt of Luck\", and played the second stage of Lollapalooza. Adam Lasus produced and engineered \"The Dirt of Luck\", \"Pirate Prude\", and all of Helium's singles up to 1995.\n\nIn 1997, the group released the EP \"No Guitars\" before releasing their second album, \"The Magic City\". This album featured synths and analog drum sounds, as opposed to their previous guitar-centered releases.\n\nCommenting on the band's new direction, in an interview with the Boston Phoenix in 1997, Timony said: \"\"It seemed natural for a girl my age to be expressing anger in music. For whatever psychological reason, I found it easier to express it in my songs than any other way. Writing out of anger is an easy framework, and that's one reason I don't do it now. I remember hearing Patti Smith say that she stopped playing music because she wasn't angry anymore. I could totally relate, except that I want to keep playing. Lately I'm more into the idea that making music is fun. I want it to be a collaborative, creative thing, rather than using music as a tool.\"\n\nThe band toured the United States in early 1998 and disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nThe band makes an appearance in a 1994 road movie, entitled \"Half-cocked\". On television, two of the band's music videos, \"Pat's Trick\" and \"XXX\", were critiqued by Beavis and Butt-head.\n\nTimony began a solo career in 2000 and Bowie released an album of old four-track recordings under the name Libraness. Timony was later a member of the bands Wild Flag and Ex Hex.\n\nMatador Records reissued the band's two albums in March, 2017, along with a new collection of rarities titled Ends With And.

{"id": "2052309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052309", "title": "Apache Tapestry", "text": "Apache Tapestry\n\nApache Tapestry is an open-source component-oriented Java web application framework conceptually similar to JavaServer Faces and Apache Wicket. Tapestry was created by Howard Lewis Ship, and was adopted by the Apache Software Foundation as a top-level project in 2006.\n\nTapestry emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and developer productivity. It adheres to the Convention over Configuration paradigm, eliminating almost all XML configuration. Tapestry uses a modular approach to web development by having a strong binding between each user interface component (object) on the web page and its corresponding Java class. This component-based architecture borrows many ideas from WebObjects.\n\n\nA minimal, templated Tapestry application needs only three files:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" \n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n\npackage org.example.demo.pages;\n\n/** A page class (automatically associated with the template file of the same name) */\npublic class HelloWorld {\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE web-app\n<web-app>\n</web-app>\n\nTapestry uses bytecode manipulation to transform page and component classes at runtime. This approach allows the page and component classes to be written as simple POJOs, with a few naming conventions and annotations potentially triggering substantial additional behavior at class load time. Tapestry versions 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 used the Javassist bytecode manipulation library. Subsequent versions replaced Javassist with a new bytecode manipulation layer called \"Plastic\" that is based on ObjectWeb ASM.\n\nTapestry 5 versions up through 5.3 bundled the Prototype and script.aculo.us JavaScript frameworks, along with a Tapestry-specific library, so as to support Ajax operations as first-class citizens. Third party modules are available to integrate jQuery instead of, or in addition to, Prototype/Scriptaculous.\n\nStarting with version 5.4, Tapestry includes a new JavaScript layer that removes built-in components' reliance on Prototype, allowing jQuery or another JavaScript framework to be plugged in.\n\nVersion 5.4 also introduces support for JavaScript \"modules\" using the RequireJS module loading system.\n\nThe Tapestry project documentation cites four \"principles\" that govern all development decisions for Tapestry, starting with version 5 in 2008:\n\n\nTapestry has been criticized as not being backward-compatible across major versions, especially noted in the transition from version 4 to version 5, where no clean migration path was available for existing applications. Project team members have acknowledged this as a major problem for Tapestry's users in the past, and backward compatibility was made a major design goal for Tapestry going forward. From early on in the development of version 5, backward compatibility was listed as one of Tapestry's four new \"Core Principles\", and two of the other three were intended to make the evolution of the framework possible without sacrificing backward compatibility. Project team members claim that all Tapestry releases since 5.0 have been highly backward compatible.\n\nEarly criticisms of Tapestry 5 also mentioned documentation as a shortcoming. Project members now claim that this deficiency has been largely addressed with a thoroughly revised and updated User's Guide and other documentation.\n\nSince version 5.0, Tapestry has bundled the Prototype and Scriptaculous JavaScript libraries. According to Howard Lewis Ship, in the 2008-2009 timeframe these were reasonable choices. Since then, however, Prototype's popularity has declined, and jQuery's has risen dramatically. In response, the Tapestry community developed modules that allowed jQuery to be used in addition to, or instead of, Prototype. Meanwhile, the current version of Tapestry, 5.4, removes the dependency on Prototype entirely, replacing it with a compatibility layer into which either jQuery or Prototype (or potentially any other JavaScript framework) can be plugged.\n\nAccording to Howard Lewis Ship, Tapestry was initially conceived as an attempt to implement in Java some of the general concepts and approaches found in WebObjects, which was at that time written in Objective-C and closed-source.\n\nApache Wicket was developed as a response to the complexity of early versions of Tapestry, according to Wicket originator Jonathan Locke.\n\nFacelets, the default view technology in JavaServer Faces, was reportedly inspired by early versions of Tapestry, as an attempt to fill the need for \"a framework like Tapestry, backed by JavaServer Faces as the industry standard\".\n\n"}

It was developed by North American Aviation (NAA) from the smaller AJ Savage.\n\nThe XA2J was intended to be a turboprop-powered derivative of the AJ Savage, with the design as initially proposed in December 1947 a simple modification of the Savage, with extensive use of components of the earlier aircraft. The design gradually evolved, however, to improve performance and increase compatibility with operations from aircraft carriers, as it was recognized that the AJ Savage was deficient in performance and was a less-than-satisfactory carrier aircraft.\n\nThe A2J was essentially an enlarged AJ Savage with the two reciprocating engines replaced with two Allison T40 turboprop engines and removal of the tail-mounted turbojet. Like the AJ, it was a high-winged monoplane with unswept wings. The wings were fitted with leading edge slats and large trailing edge flaps, and folded outside of the engine nacelles to ease storage aboard ship. It had a crew of three: pilot, co-pilot/bombardier, and gunner who sat in a pressurised cabin in the nose of the aircraft. Up to of bombs could be carried in a large enclosed bomb-bay in the center fuselage, while the planned defensive armament was a remotely controlled tail turret with two 20 mm cannon.\n\nConstruction of two prototypes started 1 October 1948, but due to delays developing the engines, the first flight was not until 4 January 1952. The competing Douglas XA3D, the prototypes of which were ordered the year after construction had begun on the XA2J prototypes, first flew in October 1952. The A3D had far superior performance, which doomed the XA2J.\n\nThe root cause for the failure of the XA2J was the protracted development and poor reliability of the Allison T40 engines. The T40 engine was an ambitious engine design with two power sections, (the T38 was developed from the T40 to assist in its development, by using a single power section with extension shaft and gearbox), driving two large contra-rotating propellers through a combining gearbox. Both the engines and the gearbox proved to be unreliable. The T40 engine was also used in the developmental Douglas A2D Skyshark, and the Republic XF-84H Thunderscreech. After a number of engine-related mishaps, the XA2J project was abandoned and the second prototype was never flown.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052351", "title": "Blue Monday (opera)", "text": "Blue Monday (opera)\n\nBlue Monday (Opera à la Afro-American) was the original name of a one-act \"jazz opera\" by George Gershwin, renamed 135th Street during a later production. The English libretto was written by Buddy DeSylva. Though a short piece, with a running time of between twenty and thirty minutes, \"Blue Monday\" is often considered the blueprint to many of Gershwin's later works, and is often considered to be the \"first piece of symphonic jazz\" in that it was the first significant attempt to fuse forms of classical music such as opera with American popular music, with the opera largely influenced by Jazz and the African-American culture of Harlem.\n\n\nAs in Gershwin's later opera \"Porgy and Bess\", all the singing roles are African-American characters. Unlike \"Porgy and Bess\", however, the original production of \"Blue Monday\" was performed by white singers in blackface.\n\nAfter a brief overture, the gambler Joe appears in front of the curtain as a Prologue, in a reference to the character Tonio's opening aria in \"Pagliacci\". Like that number, which explained the serious nature of Leoncavallo's opera as if it were an actual event, Joe tells his audience that just like \"the white man's opera\", this \"colored [Harlem] tragedy enacted in operatic style\" focuses on primal human emotions such as love, hate, passion and jealousy, and that the moral of the story is that tragic results come from when a woman's intuition goes wrong (Joe: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\").\n\nAs the curtain rises on a café with a bar, gambling room and dance floor, café owner Mike berates his worker Sam for his laziness and commands him to get to work. As Sam sweeps the floor, he relates that he resents \"Blue Monday\" because he always loses at dice gambling and it is the day when people die, and concludes that there is no use working on Mondays (Sam: \"Blue Monday Blues\"). The pianist Sweetpea arrives and plays for a while until the arrogant singer Tom comes in and knocks her out of the way, claiming that the only reason the café is still in business is his singing. Joe's sweetheart Vi enters, asking if anyone has seen her \"lovin' man\" Joe, whom she is supposed to be meeting for a date (Vi: \"Has Anyone Seen My Joe?\").\n\nWhen Mike goes to the backroom to ask if anyone has seen Joe, Tom attempts to seduce and woo Vi. When Tom tells her that he loves her and asks what she sees in the gambler Joe, Vi angrily retorts that even if he gambles, Joe is a man and unique. Tom continues to try and persuade Vi to leave Joe for him and he attempts to kiss her, when Vi threatens him with a revolver that Joe had given her. Mike returns with the news that no one has seen Joe, and Vi leaves. Mike again calls Sam and scolds him for being lazy, and as Sam again sweeps the floor he sings a reprise the song \"Blue Monday Blues\" (Sam: \"Monday's the day that all the earthquakes quiver\"). This time Sam more directly foreshadows the event to come, as he states that \"Monday's a day full of sad, sad news /... That's when a gal will pull a trigger, / A gal will pull a trigger\".\n\nJoe enters the café and Tom hides behind the piano to eavesdrop on his conversation with Mike. After Mike tells Joe that Vi has been looking for him and that he has heard that Joe won a large deal of money in a game of craps, Joe tells him that he is going to use the money to travel to the South the next morning to visit his mother, whom he hasn't seen in years and to whom he has recently sent a telegram (Joe: \"I'll tell the world I did\"). Joe says that he can not tell Vi that he is going, and when asked why by Mike he says that she gets jealous and angry for irrational reasons. He then relates how he yearns to see his mother and return home (Joe: \"I'm Gonna See My Mother\").\n\nJoe goes upstairs to meet Vi, and slowly the night's guests and customers arrive. After a dance, Vi tells him that she loves only him and although she is a jealous woman, if he remains true to her then she will be his (Vi: I love but you, my Joe, my Joe\"). When Joe leaves to wait for a telegram from his mother, Tom tells Vi that he overheard Joe's conversation and that the telegram is from another woman. Vi initially refuses to believe him, but when Sweetpea arrives with Joe's telegram, Vi accuses Joe of infidelity and demands to see the telegram. Joe rebukes her by pushing her away, and when he opens the envelope Vi shoots him with the revolver from her handbag.\n\nVi reads the letter, which says that there is no need for Joe to come because his mother had been dead for three years. When she realizes what she has done, she sinks to the floor and begs Joe for forgiveness, which she receives. As Joe dies, he sings that he is finally going to see his mother in heaven. (Joe: \"I'm Gonna See My Mother\").\n\nBy 1922, the improvisational and melodic talent of George Gershwin, a former song-plugger for a music publishing firm on Tin Pan Alley, allowed him to write songs for three Broadway shows and then write complete scores for four (although because every one of his previous shows was a revue, Gershwin had basically no dramatic experience). Two of Gershwin's most successful works at this time were the scores to the 1920 and 1921 productions of \"George White's Scandals\", a popular annual revue. Paul Whiteman, the music director and conductor of the \"Scandals of 1922\" (with his Orchestra in the pit), which Gershwin was again hired for, had previously worked with him when the Paul Whiteman Orchestra recorded the latter's song \"South Sea Island\" in 1921.\n\nGershwin's lyricist Buddy DeSylva originally conceived a plan for writing a \"jazz opera\" set in Harlem and based on the Italian language verismo opera \"Pagliacci\" with Gershwin in the early 1920s, and Whiteman, who had built much of his reputation on such experimental fusions of different musical and dramatic genres, persuaded producer George White to include it in the 1922 \"Scandals\". White was initially enthusiastic about an idea of a black \"opera\" because \"A recent Broadway success was \"Shuffle Along\", a show with an all-black cast—its words and music by the black creative team of Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake... White seems to have imagined that a black-oriented segment in the new edition of his revue would capitalize on \"Shuffle Along's\" appeal.\" However, after considering his decision, White realized that a thirty-minute operatic tragedy, or \"one act vaudeville opera\", as Gershwin called it, would disrupt the flow of his review, and promptly reconsidered before Gershwin and DeSylva had begun writing. The latter two, however, were still the composer and lyricist of the rest of the revue, as it would include the later-famous song \"I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise.\"\n\nThree weeks before the opening of the show, White found that he was in need of a longer program and reverted to allowing the (unwritten) opera to be included in the show. Gershwin and DeSylva wrote the work in five days and five nights, and soon after completion it was orchestrated by Will Vodery, a very talented but relatively unknown African-American composer who had befriended Gershwin.\n\nThe premiere performance of \"Blue Monday\" was at the four \"Scandal's\" tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut, and it was received there very warmly and enthusiastically. Gershwin later wrote that what he referred to as his \"composer's stomach\", ailments which he would have for the rest of his life, originated in his nervousness on the opening night of \"Blue Monday\". A few days after, it opened (and closed) on Broadway at the Globe Theatre on August 28, 1922. The opera itself did not gain a lot of acceptance because of its tragic ending, and was removed from the Scandals after only one performance.\n\nSome critics saw the work as worse than just inappropriate for the Scandals, as Charles Darnton's review in the \"New York World\" called it \"the most dismal, stupid, and incredible blackface sketch that has probably ever been perpetrated. In it a dusky soprano finally killed her gambling man. She should have shot all her associates the moment they appeared and then turned the pistol on herself.\" According to Reed College Professor of Music David Schiff, \"With the appearance of black musicals like \"Shuffle Along\" and the emergence of black stars such as Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters, the minstrel convention of blackface, which survived in the vastly popular performances of Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor, had become an embarrassment – at least to some critics.\"\n\nHowever, \"Another critic... said it was a genuine human plot of American life and foreshadowed things to come from Gershwin,\" and another wrote that \"This opera will be imitated in a hundred years.\" Most importantly, a third critic was relieved that \"Here at last, is a genuinely human plot of American life, set to music in the American vein, using jazz only at the right moments, the blues, and above all, a new and free ragtime time recitative. In it we see the first gleam of a new American musical art.\" Many biographers and musicologists would see such an assessment as a prophetic prediction of the accomplishment that Gershwin would make thirteen years later with \"Porgy and Bess\".\n\n\"Blue Monday\" was one of Gershwin's premature works and lacks the musical and dramatic sophistication of his later musicals and \"Porgy and Bess\", but jazz conductor Paul Whiteman, who conducted the original performance of the piece in 1922, was so impressed by it that he asked Gershwin to compose a symphonic jazz piece for Whiteman to conduct at a concert Whiteman was planning. The resulting piece, \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" became Gershwin's most famous composition.\n\nArts consultant Jeffrey James claims that \"Blue Monday\" is the \"genesis of the Rhapsody\", and \"the missing link in Gershwin's evolution into the Rhapsody in Blue\" as well as a source to his Preludes, Piano Concerto and \"Porgy and Bess\".\n\nAfter its disastrous flop on Broadway, \"Blue Monday\" was reportedly renamed 135th Street when Ferde Grofé re-orchestrated it in 1925, with a concert performance at Carnegie Hall on December 29 under the direction of Paul Whiteman. However, the original Grofe score exists in the archives of the Oscar & Hammerstein Library at Lincoln Center, part of the New York Public Library and is titled Blue Monday (135th Street). In an unusually daring move for 1950's television, it was presented in that medium in 1953, as part of the famous anthology, \"Omnibus\", under the title \"135th Street\". This production featured black singers, not white singers in blackface. \"Blue Monday\" is occasionally, though sparingly, revived both inside and outside of the United States, including a 1970 New York revival and recent productions in Adelaide, Australia, Livorno, Italy, Arlington, Virginia and Linz, Austria. A vocal score with a new orchestration by George Bassman was published in 1993. This version was recorded and released on CD that year.\n\nAn abbreviated version of \"Blue Monday\", performed in blackface, was included in the 1945 film biography of Gershwin, \"Rhapsody in Blue\". The sequence was a fictionalized, but basically true re-creation of the work's opening performance. Bandleader Paul Whiteman appeared as himself.\n\nOn September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score (with the original orchestrations by Will Vodery) will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent.\n\nThe entire Gershwin project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, and it is unclear when the \"Blue Monday\" edition will be released.\n\n"}

Ulithian is one of the six official languages of the Federated States of Micronesia. There are some 3,000 speakers, although only 700 of these live on Ulithi Atoll.\n\nIn 2010, a UlithianEnglish and EnglishUlithian dictionary was published by Habele, a US-based charity. The authors' stated aim was to create a consistent and intuitive pattern of Roman alphabet spelling useful for both native Ulithian and native English speakers.\n\nUlithian is a language spoken in Micronesia. The specific islands that Ulithian is spoken in are Ulithi, Ngulu, Sorol, Fais Islands and Eastern Caroline Islands. There are also a few speakers that can be found in the United States. Ulithian has about 3039 speakers, 700 of which reside in Ulithi itself. Many of the other Pacific languages spoken in the surrounding islands are similar to Ulithian which makes it easier for others to understand. In a way, it is a universal language for the area. The people who live in and around Ulithi are classified as Micronesian. Their appearances greatly vary because of all the different people who passed through the area over time. Ulithi has a strong democracy with a king by name voted by the people. Because the Ulithian language is so widely recognized, it holds a good status in the islands. It is also one of the six official languages in the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nUlithian has 19 consonants which are /b, ch, d, f, g, h, k, l, l', m, mw, n, ng, p, r, s, t, w, y/.\n\nUlithian has eight vowels which is a large amount for a Pacific language.

It can be used to show a stronger emotion, for example, means jealous and means short tempered or easily set off. It can also be used for similar things, for example means the color white, and is glare or the reflection of the sun.\n\n\nAt various times, Spain, Germany, Japan, and the United States had control over the islands of Ulithi. Each one of these groups left behind words that have been evolved and are now used in the Ulithian language. Linguists have used these words to trace back what items each group introduced to Ulithi.\n\nSpain has had an influence in Ulithi since the early 1500s. They left behind things like foods, religious terms, and animals. Some examples of words from Spanish:\nSince Spain passed through Ulithi for such a long period of time, the words they left were used because they actually left behind those things. Foods like the potato and squash were brought by the Spanish, so Ulithian uses words based on the Spanish words for them. Spain was also Catholic, so Catholic terms were left behind.\n\nJapan occupied Ulithi during the time of World War I and left during or after World War II. Before the World Wars, Japan traded with Ulithi. Since the two countries were trade partners, they needed to know how to communicate. Every so often, young boys would learn the basics of Japanese and because of this, \"it is not at all difficult today to find Ulithians who speak and write a bit of Japanese\". An example of a word from Japan \"denwa\" which Ulithian changed to \"dengwa\" which means telephone. Japan had such a big impact that the word for battery, \"denchi\", remained the same in Ulithian.\n\nGermany did not occupy Ulithi for long, so they left the least influence and there are almost no words that were left behind and still used. One of the few words that got carried over is \"mark\", a German coin which turned into \"mak\", what Ulithians call the U.S. half dollar.\n\nIn 1944, the U.S. task force arrived in Ulithi and there has been an abundance of English loan words since then. The most impact English is having on Ulithian is through the school systems. Words such as homework and campus which in Ulithian are \"homwork\" and \"kampus\" are very similar.\n\nThere are some loan words that have become the official word in Ulithian, but others are used in place of another word. The Spanish word \"flores\" which means flower was taken and used by Ulithian speakers as \"floras\". According to the Ulithian-English Dictionary written by Neil Mellen and John Hancock, the general word for flowers is \"floraas\" which is close to what is stated in the journal. While the word for flower was similar, the Spanish word for table, \"mesa\" was directly taken to use in Ulithian. The Ulithian-English Dictionary says that the translation of table is \"tiis\". This is totally comparable to speaking pidgin in Hawaii. There are a lot of Japanese words that the majority of people, even if they do not speak Japanese, use such as \"shoyu\" for soy sauce and \"bocha\" for a bath.\n\nAs far as social media such as radio and television, there does not seem to be any in specifically Ulithian but there are some in other surrounding languages. Esikiel Lippwe states in a letter that radio and television stations are very important because they effectively educate and bring awareness to the people about things like health issues.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, Ulithian is ranked at an EGIDS level of 5 which means that the language is being used vigorously, but not as a main language. It is most likely being used more by the older generation. There is a possibility of the language dying out, but it is still in good standing (Ethnologue).\n\n\n"}

In 1968, Marshall was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada but was, over her long career, the recipient of many other honours and awards, such as the University of Alberta National Award in Music (1962), the Centennial Medal (1967), a Canada Music Council Medal (1972), the Ontario Arts Council Medal of Excellence (1973), the Molson Prize (1980), the Toronto Arts Award for music (1987), a Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement (1993) and the Order of Ontario (1993). She held honorary degrees from the Universities of Toronto and Regina, and the Royal Conservatory made her an honorary fellow in 1994.\n\nShe enjoyed a long career, primarily as a concert and recital singer, first as a soprano and later as a mezzo-soprano. She recorded extensively and in a very wide repertoire. Especially prized are the live recordings, which provide something of the vitality and warmth she radiated on those occasions. The lifelong effects of childhood polio severely limited her mobility, especially in later years. Nevertheless, she appeared occasionally on opera stages and in televised opera, including Boston productions especially staged for her by Sarah Caldwell. Her final performances in opera were as the old nurse in \"Eugene Onegin\", in both Ottawa and Toronto. Early fame came with appearances and recordings with Toscanini and Beecham. For many years, she toured as the soprano soloist in the Bach Aria Group, and sang in annual Toronto performances of Messiah and St. Matthew Passion under Sir Ernest MacMillan and successive conductors of the Toronto Symphony.\n\nDates in parentheses are the dates of recording.\nMuch of Lois Marshall's recorded legacy is held in the archives of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

I just liked the combination of words... Instead of 'Eat your heart out' or 'I'll get even with you,' it sounded like a good, smart retort to somebody who had hurt your feelings or broken your heart.\" He was initially concerned that listeners would hear a reference to the Crimea, rather than \"..cry me a...\", but said that \"..sitting down and playing the melody and coming up with lyrics made it a nonissue.\"\n\nA bluesy jazz ballad, \"Cry Me a River\" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film, \"Pete Kelly's Blues\" (released 1955). According to Hamilton, he and Julie London had been high school classmates, and she contacted him on behalf of her husband, Jack Webb, who was the film's director and was looking for new songs for its soundtrack.\nAfter the song was dropped from the film, Fitzgerald first released her version on \"Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie!\" in 1961. The song was also offered to Peggy King, but Columbia Records A&R chief Mitch Miller objected to the word \"plebeian\" in the lyric. \n\nThe song's first release was by actress and singer Julie London on Liberty Records in 1955, backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Leatherwood on bass. London had been urged to record the song by Bobby Troup, her future husband following her divorce from Webb. A performance of the song by London in the 1956 film \"The Girl Can't Help It\" helped to make it a bestseller (reaching no. 9 on US and no. 22 on UK charts). It became a gold record, and in 2016, it was inducted by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.\n\nOne site, Secondhand Songs, lists 484 recorded versions of the song (as at March 2020).

In 2010, Lindberg married Herminia Mabunda from Mozambique and adopted her surname. He had five children.\n\nLindberg died unexpectedly on 26 March 2019, aged 53.\n\nLindberg was involved with underground performance art and entertainment for many years. His stage name \"Master Fatman\" was first chosen during a performance of his in March 1987, attempting to channel and incarnate Liberace's soul into his body. Lindberg used other stage names and alter egos, but Master Fatman eventually emerged as the most popular one. \n\nLindberg had a very broad range of interests and engaged with magazine writing, publishing and editing, theatre, film, tv, radio and music, usually with a good deal of humour and subtle irony, but also out of genuine artistic interest and curiosity, and an urge for creative expression. In the early 1990s, he took up an interest in acting and film making, and among his first engagements was the lowbudget short film \"Gayniggers from Outer Space\", which later obtained a cult status. This was the first and only time Lindberg tried his hands with film directing, but he continued his film interest with acting roles and writing. In 1993, after travelling in India, Lindberg started the political party \"Det Kosmiske Parti\" (The Cosmic Party) and participated in the Copenhagen municipal elections as the love preaching self-styled guru \"Tykmesteren\" the following year, another stage name of his. Although close to being elected, he didn't make it, but kept evolving the cosmic guru role and was associated with it ever after. Through the later half of the 1990s and early 2000s, he edited and wrote for the underground magazine \"Magasin Schäfer\" along with Danish writers Martin Kongstad and Henrik List. \n\nMaster Fatman participated in the Danish Eurovison contest of 1995 with his song \"\"Jordisk Kærlighed\"\" (Earthly Love), but didn't win. In 2006, also as Master Fatman, he competed in the third season of the dance contest \"Vild med dans\" on TV2, wearing several eye-catching costumes, including an Elvis outfit.\n\nLindberg travelled widely to experience the cultures of the world and he developed particularly strong ties to India, Brazil, Mozambique (and Africa in general), and France. In Brazil, where he lived for extended periods, his social indignation and concern was aroused after experiencing the Brazilian favelas and seeing how rough life was there. As a response, Lindberg eventually set up and sponsored orphanages and humanitarian child care projects in Brazil, among other engagements. With his African wife, Lindberg owned a second home in Mozambique.\n\nAs a musician, Lindberg participated in numerous projects and bands, both as an instrumentalist and a singer. Projects and bands that he has been in include: Master Fatman and his Freedom Fighters, Master Fatman Guru Orchestra, Lindberg Hemmer Foundation, Nature TM and Per Kristensen Band. Most of the bands that Lindberg was involved with were out of the mainstream and only modestly popular. The musical styles was broadranging, from punk, growling and heavy metal to instrumental jazz, disco and easy listening.\n\nLindberg had a very broad range of musical interests, and was an avid jazz lover, in particular the Brazilian Bossa-style jazz, and he ran his own jazz program for several years on the Danish Radio (DR). He was also a frequent host at various Danish jazz events and shows.\n\nFood, especially vegetarian food, had Lindbergs interest throughout most of his life. He was himself a vegetarian since his early twenties, and he hosted several tv-programs about food and cooking for the Danish National TV DR. In his radio show Croque Monsieur at Radio24syv he explored and mediated his love for the French cuisine, in particular his love for cheese and cakes, and followed it up with a cookbook in 2017. \n\nLindbergs image as a fat man, was a deliberate act of his, and started out as a counterreaction to all the weight loss diets and popular ideals of being slim in the 1980s. He increased his cake consumption and drank cream and ate raw bacon as part of stage acts. Soon, a significant weight gain was achieved and it became part of his public image. Lindberg sought happiness and cosmic love, not material virtues, and to him, being slim simply didn't look good for men.\n\nSome of Lindberg's music has only been released on cassettes or in very limited numbers (records and cds) in underground circles. The list of substantial albums and widely circulated releases includes:\n\nAs Master Fatman, Lindberg also released a number of singles, covering disco hits from the 1970s.\n\n"}

{"id": "2052415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052415", "title": "P/poly", "text": "P/poly\n\nIn computational complexity theory, P/poly is the complexity class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded advice function. It is also equivalently defined as the class PSIZE of languages that have polynomial-size circuits. This means that the machine that recognizes a language may use a different advice function or use a different circuit depending on the length of the input, and that the advice function or circuit will vary only on the size of the input.\n\nFor example, the popular Miller–Rabin primality test can be formulated as a P/poly algorithm: the \"advice\" is a list of candidate \"a\" values to test. It is possible to precompute a list of at most \"n\" values such that every composite \"n\"-bit number will be certain to have a witness \"a\" in the list. For example, to correctly determine the primality of 32-bit numbers, it is enough to test \"a\" = 2, 7, and 61. The existence of short lists of candidate witnesses follows from the fact that for each composite \"n\", 3/4s of all possible \"a\" values are witnesses; a simple counting argument similar to the one in the proof that BPP in P/poly below shows that there \"exists\" a suitable list of \"a\" values for every input size, although finding it may be expensive.\n\nP/poly, unlike other polynomial-time classes such as P or BPP, is not generally considered a practical class for computing. Indeed, it contains every undecidable unary language, none of which can be solved in general by real computers. On the other hand, if the input length is bounded by a relatively small number and the advice strings are short, it can be used to model practical algorithms with a separate expensive preprocessing phase and a fast processing phase, as in the example above.\n\nP/poly is an important class for several reasons. For theoretical computer science, there are several important properties that depend on P/poly:\n\n\nOne of the most interesting reasons that P/poly is important is the property that if NP is not a subset of P/poly, then P ≠ NP. This observation was the center of many attempts to prove P ≠ NP. It is known that for a random oracle \"A\", NP is not a subset of P/poly with probability 1.\n\nP/poly is also used in the field of cryptography. Security is often defined 'against' P/poly adversaries. Besides including most practical models of computation like BPP, this also admits the possibility that adversaries can do heavy precomputation for inputs up to a certain length, as in the construction of rainbow tables.\n\nAlthough not all languages in P/poly are sparse languages, there is a polynomial-time Turing reduction from any language in P/poly to a sparse language.\n\nAdleman's theorem states that BPP ⊆ P/poly, where BPP is the set of problems solvable with randomized algorithms with two-sided error in polynomial time. A weaker result was initially proven by Leonard Adleman, namely, that RP ⊆ P/poly; and this result was generalized to BPP ⊆ P/poly by Bennett and Gill.\nVariants of the theorem show that BPL is contained in L/poly and AM is contained in NP/poly.\n\nLet \"L\" be a language in BPP, and let \"M\"(\"x\",\"r\") be a polynomial-time algorithm that decides \"L\" with error ≤ 1/3 (where \"x\" is the input string and \"r\" is a set of random bits).\n\nConstruct a new machine \"M\"(\"x\",\"R\"), which runs \"M\" 18\"n\" times and takes a majority vote of the results (where \"n\" is the input length and \"R\" is a sequence of 18\"n\" independently random \"r\"s). Thus, \"M\" is also polynomial-time, and has an error probability ≤ 1/\"e\" by the Chernoff bound (see BPP). If we can fix \"R\" then we obtain an algorithm that is deterministic.\n\nIf Bad(\"x\") is defined as {\"R\": \"M\"(\"x\",\"R\") is incorrect}, we have:\n\nThe input size is \"n\", so there are 2 possible inputs. Thus, by the union bound, the probability that a random \"R\" is bad for at least one input \"x\" is\n\nIn words, the probability that \"R\" is bad for some \"x\" is less than 1, therefore there must be an \"R\" that is good for all \"x\". Take such an \"R\" to be the advice string in our P/poly algorithm.\n"}
{"id": "2052417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052417", "title": "Savoy Truffle", "text": "Savoy Truffle\n\n\"Savoy Truffle\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\"). The song was written by George Harrison and inspired by his friend Eric Clapton's fondness for chocolate. The lyrics list the various flavours offered in Mackintosh's Good News chocolates and serve as a warning to Clapton about the detrimental effect that his gorging would have on his teeth. Along with Clapton's guest appearance on the White Album track \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and Harrison reciprocating on Cream's \"Badge\", it is one of several songs that mark the start of a long-lasting musical association between the two guitarists.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Savoy Truffle\" in October 1968, towards the end of the five-month sessions for the album. An upbeat rock track in the soul genre, the song reflects Harrison's return to the guitar as his main musical instrument after two years of studying the Indian sitar. The recording includes a Chris Thomas-arranged horn section, and introduced the horn-heavy sound that became a feature of Harrison's music as a solo artist. Through the lyrics' reference to \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", the song is also an example of the Beatles' use of self-quotation in their later work.\n\nOn release, \"Savoy Truffle\" was viewed by many commentators as a sign of Harrison's growing maturity as a songwriter. Among more recent assessments, Ian MacDonald cited it as an example of the lesser material found on \"The Beatles\", while Daryl Easlea of BBC Music describes it as one of the \"doodles that delight\" and \"a fine counterweight\" to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Ella Fitzgerald, Terry Manning and They Might Be Giants have also recorded the song.\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"Savoy Truffle\" in September 1968, by which point the Beatles had been working on their self-titled double album (also known as \"the White Album\") for over three months. This period was one of disharmony within the band, following their mixed experiences while attending an advanced course in Transcendental Meditation in India early in the year, a group activity that had been led by Harrison's commitment to Eastern spirituality. Away from his work with the Beatles in 1968, Harrison increasingly spent time with Eric Clapton, leading to occasional musical collaborations between the two guitarists and a lifelong friendship. Having contributed to Harrison's solo album \"Wonderwall Music\", Clapton was invited to play on his White Album track \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" on 6 September, marking a rare appearance by another rock musician on a Beatles recording as Harrison sought to defuse tensions within the band.\n\nIn an interview with the \"NME\" in late September, Harrison said he was keen to depart from his image as \"Mystical Beatle George\" and now wanted to contribute songs without any profound message.<ref name=\"Smith/NME\"></ref> He wrote \"Savoy Truffle\" as a tribute to Clapton's sweet tooth. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's bridge sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film \"You Are What You Eat\", which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.<ref name=\"Williamson/Uncut\"></ref>\n\nMusicologist Walter Everett suggests that \"Savoy Truffle\" might have been an attempt to rewrite the Byrds' \"less innocent\" 1968 track \"Artificial Energy\", which warns of the dangers of amphetamines. The song also reflects Harrison's rediscovery of his passion for rhythm and blues. Coinciding with this, he had returned to the guitar as his main instrument in 1968, after two years of studying the sitar under the guidance of Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar.\n\n\"Savoy Truffle\" is primarily in the key of E minor, although the melody continually shifts to the parallel, major equivalent, in addition to anchoring briefly in G major. Musicologist Alan Pollack identifies the composition's harmonic style as one that \"makes you feel constantly on the move, on the threshold of some new breakthrough\", and he adds: \"There are other Beatles' songs that exploit this triumvirate of keys (i.e. a parallel Major/minor pair and the relative Major), but never quite with such audacity.\" Throughout, the meter is 4/4, delivered in an assertive, driving tempo. The song's main musical style is soul music,<ref name=\"Erlewine/AM\"></ref> while its melody and mood partly recall \"Sour Milk Sea\", which Harrison wrote earlier in 1968.\n\nIn the verses, Harrison lists a variety of chocolate flavours, beginning with \"creme tangerine\" and \"Montélimar\". He employs wordplay to incorporate the Mackintosh's brand name in his closing phrase to the first verse: \"yes, you know it's 'good news\". The refrain throughout the song – \"But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle\" – refers to the deterioration of one's teeth after eating too many sweets, echoing the warning that Clapton had recently received from his dentist.\n\nOver the second bridge, Harrison adapted Taylor's suggestion to read \"You know that what you eat you are\". In the same section, a subsequent line names the track \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", a Paul McCartney composition that would also appear on \"The Beatles\". In this way, \"Savoy Truffle\" continued a tradition initiated by John Lennon in 1967, particularly in his lyrics to \"I Am the Walrus\", whereby the Beatles deliberately quoted from their previous songs.\n\nSince \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" was not a song that McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's appropriation of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – \"We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But can you show me where you are?\" – serves as an example of Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for hidden meaning. Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.\n\nThe Beatles taped the basic track for \"Savoy Truffle\" at Trident Studios in London on 3 October 1968, the day after Harrison had recorded his and Clapton's song \"Badge\" for Cream's forthcoming album. In his \"NME\" interview the previous month, Harrison expressed satisfaction with his increased guitar contributions to the Beatles' recent recording sessions; he also said that their album would be a return to the \"funky\" rock approach that had characterised their pre-fame performances at Liverpool's Cavern club and in Hamburg. With Lennon absent between 3 and 7 October, the line-up on the rhythm track was Harrison on electric guitar, McCartney on bass, and Ringo Starr on drums. Overdubs took place on 5 October, again at Trident, and then on 11 and 14 October, at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). Chris Thomas, as assistant to the Beatles' producer, George Martin, played electric piano on the song.\nDuring the 11 October session, six saxophonists (three baritone and three tenor) performed overdubs, arranged by Thomas. These horn players were all veterans of the British jazz scene and included Art Ellefson and Ronnie Ross. Ken Scott, the Beatles' recording engineer, recalls that Harrison thought the saxophones sounded \"too clean ... too nice\" and so asked that they be treated with heavy distortion. Scott also cites Harrison's curt dismissal of Martin's objections, that the song sounded too \"toppy\", as evidence of the Beatles' growing independence during the making of the White Album – a project in which Martin played a mainly peripheral role. In author Nicholas Schaffner's description, the song's \"beefy horns\" became \"a trademark\" of Harrison's work following the Beatles' break-up in 1970.\nThe 14 October date marked the final recording session for \"The Beatles\". With Starr away in Sardinia, the overdubs consisted of another lead guitar part by Harrison, and organ, tambourine and bongos, although the latter contribution does not appear in the final mix. Harrison and Thomas have each been credited as the organ player. According to Everett, there are two organ parts, the second of which provides a \"soft, whirling\" sound over the more \"sustained\" part. In his description of the finished recording, Jonathan Gould notes the aptness of Harrison's vocal delivery, where the list of chocolate flavours \"roll off George's tongue like a catalog of life's little pleasures\". He also comments on the effectiveness of Harrison's guitar solo, which, further to the lyric's warnings regarding tooth decay, is \"pitched to the register of a dentist's drill\".\n\nMixing on \"Savoy Truffle\" was also completed on 14 October, after which Harrison left for Los Angeles to produce Jackie Lomax's album \"Is This What You Want?\" The stereo and mono mixes of the song differ in their editing of the lead guitar parts. In addition, the mono version omits the organ over the third verse.\nApple Records released \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968. \"Savoy Truffle\" was sequenced as the third track on side four of the double LP, between \"Honey Pie\" and \"Cry Baby Cry\". As with Harrison's other three contributions to the album, including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", the song was viewed by many commentators as a sign of his growing maturity as a songwriter beside Lennon and McCartney.\n\nDue to the Beatles' use of pastiche, parody, irony and, in the case of \"Savoy Truffle\" and Lennon's \"Glass Onion\", self-quotation, the album's lyrics were intensely analysed by contemporary reviewers. Alan Walsh of \"Melody Maker\" described \"Savoy Truffle\" as \"a rocker that's the most obscure track lyrically\". \"Record Mirror\"s reviewer speculated that the song \"could either be a delicate and expensive sweet or a new dance. It could be a delivery on the pomposities of intricate desserts or a depiction of the 'upper' class.\" The writer then concluded: \"Whatever it is, it swings.\" Alan Smith of the \"NME\" said that although he was \"not particularly partial\" to the song, \"there's a good, heavy sound and I'm not complaining.\"\n\nIn his review for \"International Times\", Barry Miles wrote: \"George's 'Savoy Truffle' is the best track on this [LP] side. Beautiful, impressionistic music. Don't miss this one.\" Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" praised Harrison's lead guitar playing throughout the album and highlighted the song as an example of the Beatles' success in progressing on their past work, in this case by creating \"a more sophisticated look at 'Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds'\". In \"Newsweek\"s mainly unfavourable review, Hubert Saal concluded by saying that Harrison was the album's \"hero\", as the composer of its two best songs, \"Savoy Truffle\" and \"Long, Long, Long\", and that the former \"appears to sing the praises of food and in fact is all about suffering\".\n\nGiven the lack of stylistic unity across its 30 tracks, many authors have since scrutinised the content of \"The Beatles\" with regard to whether the album would have benefited from being scaled down to a single disc, an assertion that Martin repeatedly voiced. In his book \"Revolution in the Head\", Ian MacDonald dismisses \"Savoy Truffle\" as \"space-filling\" and \"as pointless as ['Honey Pie']\". In a 2003 review for \"Mojo\" magazine, he described it more favourably as \"an efficient \"jeu d'esprit\"\". Author Alan Clayson has questioned its inclusion in light of Harrison having more substantial compositions that went unrecorded by the band, and, in the case of \"Not Guilty\", a song that the Beatles recorded but then omitted from the White Album. In his attempt to reduce the 1968 release to a single LP, Mark Caro of the \"Chicago Tribune\" listed all of Harrison's contributions except for \"Savoy Truffle\", which he included in his \"toughest deletions\" category, along with three Lennon-written songs. Writing in the 2004 \"Rolling Stone Album Guide\", Rob Sheffield said that such scrutiny had long been part of the double album's legacy. He described the track as being \"among the Beatles' finest songs\".\n\nBeatles biographer Philip Norman considers \"Savoy Truffle\" to be \"the album's best piece of rock and roll\" after McCartney's \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" While admiring the interplay between the saxophones and lead guitar as \"rousing rock-'n'-roll confectionery\", Tim Riley views the song as one of the \"essentials\" on \"The Beatles\" and, with regard to the \"sheer feel\" of the performance, Harrison's most successful contribution to the band's discography since \"I Want to Tell You\" in 1966. Former \"Creem\" critic Richard Riegel included \"Savoy Truffle\" on his 1996 list of the ten most underrated Beatles tracks, saying: \"this is a great song by any standard, certainly the most fun George would have in the sensual world for many years to come. 'Savoy Truffle' is wonderfully British psychedelic throwaway pop, much like Cream on their pop-tarty \"Disraeli Gears\", recorded back when Eric Clapton was a mortal, too.\" In the opinion of author Mark Hertsgaard, the song's most salient features are its \"beefy horns\" and the lyric directed at McCartney. He grouped it with \"Glass Onion\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"Don't Pass Me By\" as examples of how each of the four Beatles were represented on the White Album by tracks that, although short of the band's best work, were \"certainly the equal of most other pop songs of the era\".\n\nAmong more recent reviews, Daryl Easlea of BBC Music cites \"Savoy Truffle\" as an example of \"the doodles that delight\" on the White Album, and he describes it as \"a fine counterweight\" to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".<ref name=\"Easlea/BBC\"></ref> Mark Kemp, writing for \"Paste\", highlights the same pair of tracks as \"two of Harrison's finest moments ('While My Guitar Gently Weeps,'\nwith Eric Clapton wailing on lead guitar, and the surrealistic soul of 'Savoy Truffle')\".\n\n\"Savoy Truffle\" was included on the Beatles' 2012 iTunes compilation \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", which the band's website described as a collection of \"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\". In 2015, it was ranked 66th in the \"NME\"s list \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs As Chosen By Music's A-Listers\". Staff writer Leonie Cooper admired its subject matter and described the track as a \"typically off-kilter\" Harrison composition. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Savoy Truffle\" at number 7 in his ranking of the album's 30 tracks. He said it was \"the album's most criminally overlooked song\" as well as \"The Beatles at their most underrated\".\n\nJazz singer Ella Fitzgerald covered \"Savoy Truffle\" on her 1969 album \"Ella\", produced by Richard Perry. The following year, Terry Manning included the song on his album \"Home Sweet Home\". The recording features Robert Moog on synthesizer and has been described by PopMatters as \"long, freaked out\" and \"sublimely excessive\".\n\nPhish included \"Savoy Truffle\" in their performance of \"The Beatles\" on Halloween 1994, which was released in 2002 as \"Live Phish Volume 13\". The song was They Might Be Giants' contribution to the 2003 compilation \"\".\n\nAlong with a sample of the Beatles' \"Glass Onion\", the song was mashed with Jay-Z's \"Encore\" for a track on Danger Mouse's \"The Grey Album\" in 2004, creating what \"Spin\" magazine's reviewer termed a \"psychedelic Stax jam\". For the Beatles' 2006 remix album \"Love\", the track's horn parts were mixed into \"Drive My Car\". Dhani Harrison performed \"Savoy Truffle\" at the George Fest tribute concert, held at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on 28 September 2014.\n\nAccording to authors John Winn and Kenneth Womack, except where noted:\n\nThe Beatles\n\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n"}

As of September, 2006, Rushmore became an imprint label due to the project being largely unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2002, two years before the label's official establishment, Rushmore was supposed to be formed as a \"new\" Drive-Thru Records. The intention was to start the label up during Drive-Thru's distribution agreement with Geffen Records — restricting co-owners Richard and Stefanie Reines from full control over the roster, which is why they were reluctant to sign new talent — and eventually move all of Drive-Thru's bands over to Rushmore. This was meant to be a tactic to avoid Geffen taking over more of the label's roster.\n\nDuring this time, the first signed artists to be announced were Self Against City and Houston Calls, shortly followed by Day at the Fair and The Track Record a week later. In early 2005, two bands were announced to join the existing four, Madison, and The Cover.\n\nOn May 1, 2006, Day at the Fair announced their breakup.\n\nIn September 2006, The Track Record parted ways with Rushmore based on the direction of the band. An announcement states: \"As of September 1st, we are no longer affiliated with Drive-Thru / Rushmore Records. The split is due to disagreements regarding the direction of the band. While we maintain good terms with the label, there is no more progress to be made in the relationship.\"\n\nDue to issues with the label's management, Madison decided to break up in September 2006. According to a press release written by the band, the main reason behind why they split was a lack of professionalism and laziness on part of the label. The band claimed, that a month passed before submitted demos were listened to and when questioned about this, the owners responded in an often vulgar and rude manner. In the wake of this, Richard Reines wrote a lengthy response criticising Madison's announcement, mentioning that they took nine months to record said demos, then – at a time when the label had other priorities – impatiently called every couple of days asking if the material had yet been listened to, and ultimately threatened with their breakup if they weren't allowed to start recording an album within two weeks. This came after Madison's original material was rejected as it was produced by Jesse Cannon. Reines stated that he wanted to hear new material because he didn't trust Cannon's ability to produce a full-length record. This was somewhat surprising given the fact that Madison had originally been signed to Rushmore Records after independently producing an EP with Jesse Cannon so all current material which Reine's had heard was produced by the same person. The end result was that over 20 songs were recorded, produced, and mixed over an 18-month period which were never released and never received notes from the label heads.\n\nAlso in September 2006, the label dropped The Cover (whose signing was never announced). They rarely showed any activity during their brief time signed to the label.\n\nPresently, Self Against City have finished recording their full-length \"Telling Secrets to Strangers\" (released January 9, 2007), while Houston Calls are about to release their second full-length, The End of An Error. (October 14, 2008)\n\nDespite the label's lack of activity, the Rushmore Records logo has been used on various campaigns by owners Richard & Stefanie Reines. This includes a banner advertisement for You, Me, and Everyone We Know's EP, which was distributed by Drive Thru Records.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052455", "title": "Letkajenkka", "text": "Letkajenkka\n\nLetkajenkka, also known as Letkajenka in English and many other languages, is a Finnish dance.\n\nThe popular music genre and the ensuing dance craze were at their hottest during 1963–1965. Letkajenkka is based on the idea of performing Jenkka music using non-traditional instruments. Traditional instruments for playing the Jenkka, a Finnish traditional folk dance, are instruments such as the violin and accordion. In the early 1960s some composers thought of writing Jenkka tunes for more contemporary bands with more modern instruments, such as wind instruments (for a more swing-like Jenkka) and amplified instruments like electric guitars, basses, and drums (a more rock 'n' roll or boogie woogie-like sound). The form of the letkajenkka songs is consistent with traditional Jenkka, but where the music is distinctively Jenkka, the dance steps are not.\n\nErik Lindström introduced the genre with his song \"Letkajenkka\". A Swedish band called the Adventurers recorded it, and it immediately topped the charts in Finland. Later Jan Rohde, a Norwegian artist, recorded a version with lyrics with the bands the Adventurers and the Wild Ones.\n\nHalf a year later Rauno Lehtinen followed with his song \"Letkis\". This has become by far the most popular of all songs in the Letkajekka genre. It was first recorded by his studio orchestra Rautalanka Oy in August 1963, but was made popular in the October of the same year by a group called Ronnie Krank's Orchestra. His chart topper has been re-recorded approximately a hundred times, and the rights to at least 60 versions of the song are owned by Swedish publisher Stig Anderson. One well known recording of the song is by German musician Roberto Delgado.\n\nFor versions in other languages, Lehtinen's Letkis was renamed Letkiss, Let's Kiss, Lasst uns Küssen etc., for easier pronunciation in different languages. The name Letkis has nothing to do with kissing; the idea of kissing was introduced by non-Finnish speakers, who thought that the title of the song sounded like \"kissing\". In Finnish Letkis is merely short for Letkajenkka, a diminutive formed by the beginning of the word and adding \"is\" in the end.\n\nLehtinen's Letkis made the charts in many European countries, in Latin America, and even in Japan. There are numerous translations including Russian, Swedish, and Japanese. In 1965, four instrumental versions of the tune reached number one in the Netherlands simultaneously. These were by Stig Rauno, Gudrun Jankis, The Wild Ones and the Dutch Swing College Band. All four versions had the English title \"Letkiss\" rather than the original Finnish title. It remained the only Dutch number one to have originated from Finland until 2000, when \"Freestyler\" by the Bomfunk MC's reached number one.\n\nThe steps of Letkajenkka are like the steps of Bunny Hop, a novelty dance from the 1950s. It has been proposed that exchange students returning from the United States to Finland would have imported the steps of the Bunny Hop to Finland, as they had seen them on the TV show Bandstand. Whereas the Bunny Hop starts with a right foot lead, the Letkajenkka transformed into a dance based on the same step, but starting with a left leg lead. This can be seen from the early recordings for TV and in some movies made during the hottest craze. Also many translated lyrics include advice on the steps: \"left kick, left kick, right kick, right kick, forward jump, backward jump, hop, hop, hop\".\n\nThe people participating in the dance form a Conga-like line (that can also be a circle) so that everyone holds the person in front of themselves by the shoulders or the waist. The steps go as follows (everybody does the same thing):\n\n1–4 may be enhanced by bouncing with the leg opposite to the kicking side.\n\nThe music genre became popular, and many composers around the world started writing letkis music. Examples of non-Finnish letkis music include \"La Yenka\" (performed by Johnny & Charley Kurt, 1965), Gemelle Kessler's \"Lasciati Baciare Col Letkis\", \"Leaf Fall\" () by David Tukhmanov and \"Ploem Ploem Jenka\" by . Lindström's Letkajenkka was translated and covered in Japanese as Retto Kisu (Jenka) / レット・キス（ジェンカ）, performed by Kyu Sakamoto.\n\nIn Finland, the most well-known letkajenkka songs include\n\n\nThe movie \"Jamboree66\" (Sampaguita Pictures, Philippines, 1966, directed by Luciano B. Carlos) features a scene where the song \"Letkis\" is being played at a club.\n\nThere are at least two Letkajenkkas by Mimis Plessas that appear in the Greek movie \"Mia Trelli, Trelli Oikogeneia\" (Crazy, crazy family) that is directed by Dinos Dimopoulos (). There is a scene with people dancing around the pool. The steps are not strictly Jenkka, but the music is in the style of letkis. In another scene, Katerina Gogou and Alekos Tzanetakos are dancing a Letkajenkka variation as a couple to Letkis music. The choreography is John Flery's.\n\nIn the Hungarian movie \"Patyolat akció\" (1965), Mari Törőcsik and Gyula Bodrogi perform letkajenkka. The dance also appears in the Polish film \"Małżeństwo z rozsądku\" from 1966 (en. \"Marriage of Convenience\").\n\n\n"}

During his time on the show, Danny becomes represents several plotlines that contribute to his strained interactions with both Jake and their crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). This involves Danny sparking a feud with fellow mob boss Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); forming a relationship with Andy's ex-wife Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf); and killing local hardman Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) as Johnny's request.\n\nTowards the end of March 2006, Danny's exit is confirmed in the Get Johnny Week storyline when he attempts to kill Sam's brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp) on Johnny's orders - only to be accidentally killed by Jake after the latter discovered the truth about Dennis' murder. As such, Jake also comes to realize through Danny's \"bond\" with Johnny's daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) of just how their involvement in Johnny's criminal reign has rendered Danny mentally unstable beyond repair — thus destroying their brotherly interaction in the process.\n\nDanny Moon first arrives in Albert Square - the community of Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London - in late December 2004, along with his older brother Jake (Joel Beckett). Their second cousin, Alfie (Shane Ritchie) is not happy to see them since they are always in trouble - as evident when it quickly turns out that Alfie had previously took the blame for their crimes and went to prison for three years for credit card fraud. He nevertheless allows Jake and Danny to stay at his house in exchange for helping him and his younger brother Spencer (Christopher Parker) look after their grandmother, Nana (Hilda Braid).\n\nIt soon transpires that Danny and Jake are henchman who work for their crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), who recently ordered them to deliver a package on his behalf; this was unsuccessful due to Danny's incompetence and Jake later uncovering drugs in the package. Johnny soon arrives in Walford to confront the brothers over the situation, and they are forced to explain the drugs in the package. After ordering them to remain in Walford for further examination on their progress, Johnny arranges for Jake and Danny to work for the square's gangland kingpin - Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). \n\nTheir efforts to impress Johnny by working for Andy grow difficult when the latter sparks a feud with the brothers, with Danny particularly clashing with Andy on several occasions. This continues when it is publicly alleged that Andy has organized the death of his employee Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), to which Danny tauntingly probes Andy regarding his inability to cover-up his tracks. Andy later plans to get revenge on Danny by roping him in his scheme to defraud Johnny out of his £750,000 and deceiving him into believing that both Jake and Johnny view him as weak, further asserting that Danny's contribution would change Johnny's viewpoint on him instead of Jake. He reluctantly agrees and helps Andy in his scheme, after which Andy betrays Danny by leaving him behind. However, Andy's scheme fails when Johnny intercepts his plan and kills Andy by throwing him off a motorway bridge. The next day, Danny learns about Andy's death and - deducing that Johnny killed him - becomes paranoid that Johnny will kill him next. His attempts to calm down over the situation leads to Danny having a brief relationship with Andy's estranged wife, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf). Later on, Danny is enraged when Johnny fires him for incompetence and steals his business idea to expand on his nightclub - Scarlet. In retaliation, he sets fire to Johnny's house and uses the incident to try and prove to Johnny how he should be taken more seriously.\n\nDanny and Jake later plan on leaving Walford before Johnny finds out, but are caught out when Johnny finds Danny and forces him into his car. Jake then gets into the car to stay with his brother. Johnny drives them to a forest and locks Jake in the car as he prepares to shoot Danny; however, Jake kicks the car window out and escapes into the woods to find them. He tries to persuade Johnny not to kill Danny. The episode ends with Johnny raising the gun at both of them, however, their fate is not revealed until a few months later when Jake turns up, where it turns out that Johnny let them go: under the agreement that they were not seen again. Johnny allows Jake to stay in Walford, but refuses for Danny to ever return. Jake reveals that Danny has gone abroad.\n\nOff-screen, Danny begins working for Johnny to make amends for his actions. On New Year's Eve 2005, Johnny contacts Danny and orders him to murder Andy's best-friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) - who had severely beaten Johnny in retribution for killing Andy and threatening to harm Dennis' wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Returning to the Square that same night, Danny stabs Dennis in the chest and slips away unseen; Dennis ends up dying in Sharon's arms. He later reveals this to Jake, by showing him a video of the murder, on his mobile phone. Jake is later summoned to Scarlet, only to be greeted by Danny - who is there to look after things for Johnny during the latter's absence; Johnny has moved to Essex. Danny reveals his working relationship with Johnny. After hearing that his grandmother Nana (Hilda Braid) has died, he leaves again.\n\nTowards the end of March 2006, Sam's two older brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and his brother Grant (Ross Kemp) - dubbed the \"Mitchell Brothers\" in Walford - arrive in Essex with the intention of bringing Johnny to justice for Dennis' murder on behalf of Sharon, who had previously married Grant until she had an affair with Phil. It soon emerges at this point that Danny has been staying with Johnny in Essex. When Johnny gets ambushed by the Mitchell Brothers, he asks Danny to look after his daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) while he deals with Phil and Grant alone. Danny's behaviour then shows signs of mental illness when he refers to Johnny as \"dad\" when asks Ruby if he ever talks about him. He also tells Ruby to get undressed, but promises not to look. He then drugs Ruby with sleeping pills and lays on her bed, watching her sleep. Jake eventually tracks Danny down and tries to persuade him to return to Walford. Danny doesn't want to go because he thinks Johnny needs him and Johnny's home is his home as well. This causes Jake to realize that Danny has become mentally unstable, and that Johnny is merely using him to settle down a new life away from Walford.\n\nJohnny returns and is intent on killing the Mitchells with Danny's help. Danny is again confronted by his brother. During the conversation, Danny produces a mobile phone with video evidence that it was he who had killed Dennis on New Year's Eve. After a short struggle, Danny knocks Jake unconscious with a baseball bat and - under Johnny's orders - marches the Mitchells into the nearby woods armed with the shotgun and a spade with the intent to kill and bury them. Just as Danny prepares to execute Grant, he is suddenly killed when Jake appears with a pistol - which Danny had dropped in the earlier struggle between the brothers - and shoots him, albeit unintentionally killing him in the process; Jake had only meant to shoot Danny in the arm or leg to save the Mitchell Brothers. \n\nAfter confessing that Danny was the one who stabbed Dennis on Johnny's orders, Jake buries his brother in the woods - using the spade to mark his grave - whilst Phil and Grant rush out to confront Johnny, only to find that Ruby has already forced her dad to turn himself in for the murders of Andy and Dennis. The only people who are aware that Jake killed Danny are the Mitchell Brothers, Ruby, and her boyfriend Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky); a guilt-ridden Jake insists that he never intended for Danny to die. \n\nSeven months later after Danny's death, Jake's fate is left unknown when Johnny dies of a heart attack amid requesting for Jake to kill Sean for misusing Ruby - only for the mob to misinterpret Johnny's late words into believing that Jake is the target. \n"}

The last line-up was Alex Gillings (rhythm guitar), Gemma Clarke (drums), Claire Wakeman (lead guitar, vocals) and Lulu Small (bass). The band split in March 2007.\n\nThe band was formed in a school playground by childhood friends Gemma Clarke and Alex Gillings, completed by bassist Charlene Hall. The band gained popularity through their frequent touring (from the age of around 14 years old), the release of singles such as \"Hold These Eyes\" and \"Distinction\" and a Channel 4 documentary entitled \"We Are The Suffrajets\". Their fans include Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.\n\nThe band signed their first record contract with Poolside Records via Sony when the girls were 17 years old. After signing with Sony, the band toured Los Angeles and recorded their debut album with producer Greg Hampton. For 6 months they toured the UK and the first line-up change came in October 2002 when their tour bus crashed on the M25. Hall sustained a broken collarbone and ultimately left the band. She was replaced by sisters Sam (bass/vocals) and Shelley Walker (lead guitar) who were in the band for two years. It was during this period that the band wrote and recorded their album at Great Linford Manor and UB40s Dep International studios with producer Danny Sprigg. They released their single 'Distinction' which gained the band a lot of press and amazing reviews from the likes of Kerrang! The girls also came to the attention of Bruce Dickinson, who was blown away by Shelley (Lead Guitarist) and frequently played their music on his radio show.\nClarke found fame that year as a member of the original line-up of Babyshambles. The Suffrajets called a hiatus while Clarke toured with Babyshambles and played drums on several of the band's singles. After Clarke quit Babyshambles in January 2005, The Suffrajets reformed with new members Claire Wakeman (lead guitar) and Vicky Kingston (bass). They toured with punk band Towers Of London and released their first single \"Sold\" on the independent record label Tough Cookie. The single received coverage in Music Week and featured on the Radio 1 Show \"Women in Rock.\" \"Sold\" reached number 8 in the official UK Rock chart.\n\nThe Suffrajets played Download Festival and Tiscali Sessions at Reading Festival in Summer 2005 appearing alongside acts such as The Futureheads, Graham Coxon and We Are Scientists. During this period work was finished on their previously unreleased album. The band toured extensively in 2005, completing 30 dates in 30 days in September, ending in a show at the Camden Underworld. Tough Cookie were bought out of their contract by Beyond Bedlam Records who released the Suffrajets' second single \"Everything You Do\" in October 2005, earning them coverage in The Guardian and New Woman Magazine. In June 2006, the band toured the UK supporting Presidents of the United States of America, and shortly afterwards released their next single \"Worthy\", which was played on many UK radio stations. Shortly after this Vicky Kingston left the group, to be replaced by Lulu Small. Their album \"Crooked Mile\" went on release in September 2006, but was only available via their website.\n\nAfter 11 years playing together, the band announced that they had split in March 2007. Clarke and Wakeman went on to form The Krak, Gillings immediately after splitting from The Suffrajets formed Lullaby Project & Bears (an acoustic duo), before forming her current band The Great Malarkey, an 8 piece folk punk band based in London, but touring the UK, Europe and Scandinavia regularly and Small reformed her original band Seven Embers.\n"}

It is based in Washington, D.C., and the membership consists primarily of journalists, students, educators, and communications professionals.\n\nAccording to the NLGJA's website, \"NLGJA is an organization of journalists, media professionals, educators and students working from within the news industry to foster fair and accurate coverage of LGBTQ issues. NLGJA opposes all forms of workplace bias and provides professional development to its members.\" The association offers professional development opportunities for its members, in addition to resources newsrooms including a Rapid Response Task Force, Stylebook Supplement on LGBTQ Terminology,<ref name=\"http://www.nlgja.org/stylebook\">http://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/</ref> and informational tip-sheets.\n\nThe association was founded by Roy Aarons in 1990, along with other journalists, Elaine Herscher, Shannon Hickey, David Tuller, Victor Zonana, and Kathleen Buckley, who made up its first board.\n\nJen Christensen took over as NLGJA national president following the death of Michael Triplett, who died Jan. 18, 2013, less than six month after his election.\n\nPast national Presidents of NLGJA include Roy Aarons (founder), Karen-Louise Boothe, Robert Dodge, Steven Petrow, Eric Hegedus, David Steinberg and Michael Triplett.\n\nNLGJA hosts three annual benefit events to support its programs throughout the year: the Headlines & Headliners Benefit in New York City, Dateline:DC in Washington, DC, and L.A. Exclusive in Los Angeles. The events have drawn guests including Don Lemon, Hoda Kotb, Meredith Vieira, Rue McClanahan, and Barry Manilow.\n\nThe association has inspired the founding of the in 2013.\n\nNLGJA works with the Centers for Disease Control as part of the Partnering and Communicating Together to Act Against AIDS (PACT) program. As part of the partnership, NLGJA offers workshops and resources to educate journalists about the HIV & AIDS epidemic.\n\nFrom its inception in 1990, NLJGA hosts an annual convention inviting their members to participate in top-level training sessions, thought-provoking discussions, and social & professional networking events. From 2003 to 2016, a one-day LGBT Media Summit was added to the event to educate and network journalists working within LGBT media.\n\nThe 2012 convention was the first time NLGJA participated in the joint UNITY Journalists convention, held in Las Vegas with the Asian American Journalists Association, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the Native American Journalists Association.\n\n2010 marked the 20th anniversary for NLGJA. It hosted its annual convention in San Francisco. In 2009 , NLGJA held its first international convention in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nPrevious conventions have been held in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and San Francisco, among other cities.\n\nThe group published a quarterly newsmagazine called \"Outlook\" until the mid-2000s. The magazine focused on LGBTQ stories in the workplace and workplace issues such as domestic partner benefits, and updates readers on NLGJA's activities at the local and national levels. The magazine had a circulation of over 3,500. As it was written by news professionals, it had a high level of professional writing and was recognized as a source for commentary on LGBTQ workplace issues.\n\nStarting in 2005, the NLGJA has inducted noteworthy LGBTQ journalists into a Hall of Fame (HOF) so that their legacy may be remembered for generations to come. Inductions occur during the NLGJA National Convention each year along with the annual Excellence in Journalism awards.\n\nInductees by year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing a tradition started in 1993, the NLGJA Excellence in Journalism Awards are given each year to recognize journalists who have made a difference in their field. Each year the organization chooses recipients for awards in over 30 categories spanning fields including local television, radio, HIV/AIDS coverage, photojournalism, and feature writing. The awards are given out at the NLGJA National Convention each year.\n\nThe 2018 Excellence in Journalism Awards were announced on July 3, 2018 with awards presentations scheduled for September 8–10, 2018 in Palm Springs, California during the organization's 3-day annual convention.\nNick Broomfield and Marc Hoeferlin for “Whitney: Can I Be Me”, Showtime and BBC\nPeggy Kusinski, Katy Smyser, Lisa Capitanini, Richard Moy, Julio Martinez and Nathan Halder for “Some Local Rules Keep Transgender Athletes From Competing In High Schools”, NBC5 Chicago\nTodd Cross and Gabe Gutierrez for “One Year After Pulse Nightclub Shooting, 4 People Reflect on How Their Lives Changed”, Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist/NBC\nNatalie Winston, Gabriela Saldivia and David Greene for “‘They Told Me I Wasn’t A Human Being’: Gay Men Speak Of Brutal Treatment In Chechnya”, National Public Radio\nKate Sloan and Indiana Joel for “What It’s Like to Talk to Your Doctor About Sexual Health When You’re Bisexual”, Xtra\nLinda Villarosa for “America’s Hidden HIV Epidemic”, The New York Times Magazine\nMargie Fishman for “A Child’s Journey to ‘Truegender’”, The News Journal/USA Today\nPhoebe Wang for “God + The Gays”, The Heart (Radiotopia)'\n\n\n\nThe NLGJA's most noteworthy tangible contribution to the journalism industry is the \"NLGJA Stylebook Supplement on LGBTQ Terminology\", which fellow journalists can use for reference when writing about topics relating to the LGBTQ community. According to the organization's website it is part of the NLGJA's push to encourage \"the association's mission of inclusive coverage of LGBTQ people\"\n\nThe \"Stylebook Supplement\" can be found on the NLGJA website in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn connection with Witeck-Combs Communications, the NLGJA launched OutNewsWire in 2008 to simplify the distribution of news articles relating to the LGBTQ community. The wire has more than 400 journalists receiving updates currently, which are available online. The service comes at a discounted price to \"nonprofits hoping to use the service to reach the LGBTQ media\".\n\nAs early as 1996, the NLGJA, along with Hollywood Supports, developed “sexual orientation in the workplace” seminars that were conducted in Knight-Ridder newspapers across on the nation. The seminars were designed to place emphasis on acceptance in the workplace, through discussions of stereotypes and business and legal issues involved with the LGBTQ community. The stated goal of these seminars was to provide an LGBTQ-friendly office environment for LGBTQ journalists, but the discussions also pushed for domestic partnership benefits at newspapers across the nation, one of the main focuses of the LGBTQ rights movement nationwide. The seminars are offered free of charge to news organizations.\n\nDuring the seminars, facilitators introduce employees to the “model of parity” NLGJA developed in order to encourage equality and inclusiveness within the workplace. There are fourteen steps in this model, highlighting both workplace climate and fair compensation. Included in these steps are things like avoiding double standards, promoting balanced coverage, providing the same insurance coverage for all employees, and offering family and medical leave.\n\nIn order to more directly combat biased journalism, the NLGJA formed the Rapid Response Task Force. This team of journalists addresses any news piece that readers report as being offensive or inaccurate and informs writers and readers of the correct terminology, which furthers their mission of equality and helps to “spread awareness about issues facing the LGBTQ community”. In order to report a biased or offensive story, readers simply email the link or a description of the article to the NLGJA and the problem is evaluated.\n\nIn an attempt at connecting with and encouraging future LGBTQ journalists, the NLGJA created the CONNECT: Student Journalism Project. The program brings 12 young journalists to NLGJA's National Convention each year to form a newsroom and cover the local community and convention events. Since its inception, over 200 students have participated in the CONNECT program.\n\nThe NLGJA offers several scholarships each year to students \"committed to NLGJA's mission of fair and accurate coverage of the LGBTQ community.\" These scholarships include the Leroy F. Aarons scholarship and the Kay Longcope Scholarship scholarship, each of which provides tuition money to one LGBTQ student a year.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2009, the organization lost members due to the number of people laid off in the media industry that year. Since then, membership has steadily grown to include over 750 members.\n\n\n"}

Interested in the world, he abandoned his mother's practices and studied Christianity for a long while under a Protestant minister before ultimately deciding that it was not for him either. He returned to his own religion, Buddhism, and eventually came into contact with Rinzai teachings.\n\nEventually, he also grew distant from Rinzai Buddhism and was unsatisfied by his life as a businessman. In 1935, when he was studying economics in Tokyo, Deshimaru began to practice under Sōtō Zen Master Kodo Sawaki.\n\nFollowing the Attack on Pearl Harbor, his master predicted that Japan would lose the war. When Deshimaru departed from his Master, Kodo said \"Our homeland will be destroyed, our people annihilated . . . and this may be the last time we see one another. Nevertheless, love all mankind regardless of race or creed.\"\n\nDeshimaru was exempted from the Imperial Japanese Army because of his near-sightedness. He went to the island of Banka, Indonesia, to direct a copper-mine. He found himself on the island of Bangka, where he taught the practice of \"zazen\" to the Chinese, Indonesian, and European inhabitants. He defended inhabitants against the violence of his own people, and was therefore almost thrown in jail, in which case he would have been released by \"the highest military authorities in Japan\".\n\nThereafter Deshimaru went to the island of Belitung, to direct a copper mine which was captured from the Dutch. After the war Deshimaru was taken prisoner by the Americans, and sent to a camp in Singapore.\n\nDeshimaru quickly rejoined Kodo Sawaki. He studied with him for fourteen years, until Sawaki's death in 1965. Deshimaru received the monastic ordination shortly before Sawaki became ill. Deshimaru claims to have received dharma transmission at Sawaki's death bed, but it was never registered with the Soto school. Sawaki is said to have expressed his wish to spread Zen to other parts of the world on his death-bed, and asked Deshimaru to travel to Europe and spread the teaching.\n\nIn 1967, Deshimaru went to Europe and settled in Paris in order to fulfill his master's wish and spread the teachings of Zen. In an interview Deshimaru affirmed he chose France to teach because of its philosophical tradition; he cited Michel de Montaigne, René Descartes, Henri Bergson and Nicolas Malebranche as philosophers who understood Zen without even knowing it. In the 1970s, his mission grew. In 1970 Deshimaru received dharma transmission from Master Yamada Reirin. He became Kaikyosokan (head of Japanese Soto Zen for a particular country or continent) in Europe.\n\nHe died in 1982, after he had solidly established Zen practice in the West. After Master Deshimaru's death, three of his closest disciples, Etienne Zeisler, Roland Rech, and Kosen Thibaut, traveled to Japan to receive the shiho from the highest Soto authority, Master Rempo Niwa Zenji.\nIn 1977 Master Deshimaru ordained Olivier Wang-Genh into his Soto-lineage. In 2016 Olivier Wang-Genh was re-appointed President of the Buddhist Union of France.\n\nDeshimaru founded the Association Zen Internationale in 1970, and La Gendronnière in 1979. Deshimaru trained many disciples, and was the catalyst for the creation of a multitude of practice centers. His teachings and multitude of books helped spread the influence of Zen in Europe and America, particularly of the Sōtō sect.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052477", "title": "Nymphaeum", "text": "Nymphaeum\n\nA nymphaeum or nymphaion (), in ancient Greece and Rome, was a monument consecrated to the nymphs, especially those of springs.\n\nThese monuments were originally natural grottoes, which tradition assigned as habitations to the local nymphs. They were sometimes so arranged as to furnish a supply of water, as at Pamphylian Side. A nymphaeum dedicated to a local water nymph, Coventina, was built along Hadrian's Wall, in the northernmost reach of the Roman Empire. Subsequently, artificial grottoes took the place of natural ones.\n\nThe nymphaeum in Jerash, Jordan (\"illustration, above right\"), was constructed in 191 AD. The fountain was originally embellished with marble facing on the lower level, painted plaster on the upper level, and topped with a half-dome roof, forming a giant niche. Water cascaded through seven carved lion's heads into small basins on the sidewalk.\nThe nymphaea of the Roman period, which extended the sacral use to purely recreational ones, were borrowed from the constructions of the Hellenistic east. The majority of them were rotundas, and were adorned with statues and paintings. They served the threefold purpose of sanctuaries, reservoirs and assembly-rooms. A special feature was their use for the celebration of marriages. Such nymphaea existed in Corinth, Antioch and Constantinople; the remains of some twenty have been found in Rome and many in Africa. The so-called exedra of Herodes Atticus (which corresponds in all respects to a nymphaeum in the Roman style), the nymphaeum in the palace of Domitian and those in Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli (\"Tibur\") — five in number — may be specially mentioned.\nNymphaea were important in the architectural movement of mosaic from floor to walls and ceiling vaults in the 1st century. Initially they were often decorated with geometrical mosaics often incorporating shells, but by the end of the century could contain ambitious figure subjects.\n\nThe term \"nymphaeum\" was also applied to the fountains of water in the atrium of the Christian basilica, which according to Eusebius were symbols of purification. Phiale is an equivalent Greek term.\n\nA nymphaeum for \"al fresco\" summer dining featuring artificial grottoes with waterflows was designed by Bartolomeo Ammanati (1550–1553), and was reintroduced at the Villa Giulia, Rome.\n\n\n"}

A spin-off of the \"Xenosaga\" trilogy and forming part of the \"Xeno\" metaseries, \"Xenosaga I & II\" retells the events \"Xenosaga Episode I\" and \"Xenosaga Episode II\" while expanding on its characters and narrative. Displayed from an angled two-dimensional perspective, \"Xenosaga I & II\" makes use of a turn-based battle system with elements carried over from the main \"Xenosaga\" games.\n\n\"Xenosaga I & II\", Monolith Soft's first portable video game title, began development in 2005 following the completion of \"\". The scenario, drafted and supervised by series creator Tetsuya Takahashi, was intended to retell the story of the two games while incorporating events that had originally been cut. The game was released exclusively in Japan in March 2006. Upon release, it received generally positive reviews from critics, but was not commercially successful.\n\n\"Xenosaga I & II\" is a role-playing video game which retells the events of \"Xenosaga Episode I\" and its direct sequel \"Episode II\". Cutscenes and the in-game environments and character sprites are displayed on the Nintendo DS (DS) console's top screen, with events outside still animated cutscenes taking place from an angled top-down perspective using two-dimensional graphics. Additional information is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Environments can be freely explored, with breakable chests holding consumable items and accessories. Shops within the levels can be used to purchase items and equipment using in-game currency. Special EVA structures within the environment can be used to recover health points (HP) and a type of skill point called ether points (EP). Characters are able to both roam around open environments and enter story-based dungeons. During the course of the story, the player receives emails through the U.M.N. service, which is also used to store the game's glossary, a store of information on the world and characters.\n\nUnlike the original versions, \"Xenosaga I & II\" features random encounters within the environment, with enemies only appearing in the battle arena. During battle, the battle arena is displayed on the DS's top screen while commands and party status is displayed on the bottom screen. Battles are governed by a turn-based battle system similar to the main \"Xenosaga\" games. Battles take plates on a 5x6 grid divided between the main party and the enemy party. During their turn, a character can move to any part of their half of the grid.\n\nThe party's statistics are divided between HP, EP which is drained by using Ether abilities, attack points (AP) when a party member performs an attack, and a boost count gauge which is filled when an enemy attacks. Each character is given two actions per turn, with one physical and one magical attack per character. When a character has three AP available, they can attack twice and trigger a special cinematic attack which deals high damage. The Boost meter, once filled, grants either side additional turns.\n\nIn addition to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New formations are acquired through the course of the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In addition to standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.\n\nEarly development work for \"Xenosaga I & II\" began following the completion of \"\" in 2005, although plans existed while the anime was in development. \"Xenosaga I & II\" was co-developed by \"Xenosaga\" series developer Monolith Soft and external studio Tom Create. It was Monolith Soft's first time developing a portable game, as they had previously only worked on home console titles. The script was written by Yuichiro Takeda, whose previous work included both \"Xenosaga: The Animation\" and \"Xenosaga\" CD dramas. The script was based on drafts by series creator Tetsuya Takahashi, who supervised the writing process. Staff related to multiple video game and anime projects took part, with their previous work including \"\". Character designs were redrawn by Hiroshi Takeuchi, who had done artwork for \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"My-HiME\". The drawing director was Ai Kikuchi, who had worked on the anime adaptation of the . Cutscene director Hiroyuki Okawa had worked on both \"Xenosaga: The Animation\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED\". Coloring for cutscene artwork was done by Studio Deen. The music was composed by Kousuke Yamashita, who had previously worked on both \"Xenosaga: The Animation\" and the \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" series. Due to the size of the narrative, the game used a 2D art style so minimal story content was cut. Voice acting was limited to victory quotes after successful battles, with the rest of the story communicated solely with text.\n\nTakeda was first shown the project while still working on \"Xenosaga: The Animation\", a work load he estimated at six months. Once work on the anime had finished, Takeda and Takahashi began work on the script. Takahashi created the draft based on his original plans for the \"Xenosaga\" storyline, which had needed substantial alteration for the original \"Episode I\" and \"Episode II\" due to both design and time limitations. The scenario for \"Episode I\" required little alteration as it was relatively unaltered from Takahashi's initial draft. For \"Episode II\", more substantial alterations were made such as rearranging flashback sequences so the story would maintain an uninterrupted flow, and greatly expanding information concerning the Immigrant Fleet faction and the origins of central character Jr.. During the \"beta\" period of script development, the scenario for \"Episode II\" only made up 30% of the whole game, which was seen as a drastic imbalance requiring rewrites to address it. To better connect the two storylines, characters from \"Episode II\" were given minor cameos within the events of \"Episode I\". A major change was the shift to the viewpoint of main protagonist Shion Uzuki, as \"Episode II\" originally portrayed events from the perspective of Jr., a concession that enabled events to be fleshed out. Despite these changes, keeping the narrative consistent with the in-development \"Xenosaga Episode III\" was a necessity. Ultimately the scenario came close to what Takahashi originally intended for \"Episode I\" and \"Episode II\". The total writing work on \"Xenosaga I & II\" lasted over six months, with Takeda needing to visit Monolith Soft's offices once a week to discuss the script.\n\nThe game was first announced in December 2004 under the working title \"Xenosaga DS\" alongside a DS game in the \"Baten Kaitos\" series. The game's official title and release window were announced in September 2005 alongside reveal of \"Xenosaga Episode III\" and \"Baten Kaitos Origins\". The game released on March 30, 2006; it was the fourth video game release in the \"Xenosaga\" franchise. Along with the mobile spin-off \"\", \"Xenosaga I & II\" remains exclusive to Japan.\n\nDuring its debut week on sale in Japan, the game debuted outside the top ten, reaching fifteenth place with sales of over 17,000 units. These low sales were noted as disappointing for a game within the \"Xenosaga\" series, which was still popular in Japan. By the end of 2006, the game had sold 38,500 units.\n\nWhile Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" praised the game's storyline, with one reviewer saying the story was the main reason for playing the game, another reviewer found the technical terminology slowed the pace. RPGFan writer Neal Chandran felt that the story was lacking despite the additions and supplementary material, although he found that the story delivery struck a better balance with gameplay than the original games. RPGamer's Michael Baker positively compared the story to \"a particularly well-organized season of \"\"\" in spite of the need to read the in-game encyclopedia to keep up with its terminology, but noted that the amount of text could be off-putting, also citing the game being in Japanese as a barrier to importing the title.\n\nIn its review, one \"Famitsu\" reviewer found elements of the gameplay quite challenging despite it being an \"orthodox\" role-playing game. Chandran enjoyed the additions to saving and navigation, and praised the battle system despite some pacing issues and annoying mechanics. Baker praised the streamlining of general gameplay and the battle system, lauding the removal of the more convoluted mechanics of the original games. His main complaint was the mini-games, which he found lacked substance. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot compared the battle system to the mainline \"Xenosaga\" titles, positively noting the battle system mechanics.\n\n"}

KMBZ is owned by Entercom Communications and it airs a talk radio format. Its studios and transmitter tower are in suburban Mission, Kansas, at separate locations.\n\nAfter a local morning drive time news show, simulcast with co-owned 98.1 KMBZ-FM, KMBZ's weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated talk programs including Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Tom Sullivan, Joe Pags, Laura Ingraham and \"Coast to Coast AM\" with George Noory. World and national news is supplied at the beginning of each hour by ABC News Radio. Weekend programming includes shows on money, health, computers and cooking. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. KMBZ's sister station, KMBZ-FM, airs mostly local talk shows.\n\nKMBZ operates at 5,000 watts around the clock. It uses a non-directional antenna by day; at night, however, it broadcasts using a directional antenna to protect other stations on AM 980 from interference. On January 14, 2015, KMBZ was granted an FCC construction permit to move to the KCCV transmitter site and increase the daytime power to 9,000 watts. Its signal covers the Kansas City metropolitan area, including parts of Missouri and Kansas.\n\nKMBZ is the oldest surviving station in Kansas City, beginning experimental broadcasts in 1921. The station officially signed on as a commercially licensed station on April 5, 1922, with the call sign WPE. It was the second radio station in the state of Missouri, behind only St. Louis' WEW.\n\nIn its history it has been owned by two rival branches of the Latter Day Saint movement although it has no church affiliation now. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS Church based in Independence, Missouri) bought the station in 1923 and renamed it KFIX and later KLDS (with the LDS standing for \"Latter Day Saints\").\n\nIn 1928, Midland Broadcasting bought the station and renamed it KMBC for Midland Broadcasting Company. In 1953, Midland put Channel 9 KMBC-TV on the air as a shared time arrangement with another local radio station owner. Cook Paint and Varnish Company bought the Midland holdings in 1954. KMBC-AM-TV operated out of the Lyric Theatre.\n\nIn 1961, Cook sold the radio and television stations to Metromedia. In 1962, Metromedia signed on 99.7 KMBC-FM (later KMBR and KLTH, now KZPT). In 1967, Metromedia sold both radio stations to Bonneville International but kept the television station. Bonneville is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) based in Salt Lake City. So for the second time, the station was owned by an LDS Church organization. Since Metromedia held the rights to the KMBC call letters, Bonneville changed the AM station's call letters to KMBZ. The choice was deliberate; \"Z\" rhymes with \"C\", allowing Bonneville to continue trading on the old call letters. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the station's nickname was \"Z-98\". During those years, the station aired a full service middle of the road music format.\n\nIn 1997, Bonneville sold its entire Kansas City cluster, which by then consisted of KMBZ, KLTH, and KCMO-AM-FM, to Entercom Communications.\n\nPaul Henning, who created \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", was a writer, actor, disc jockey and newsreader at the station early in his career.\n\nAfter having worked as Director of Promotion for the Kansas City Royals baseball team, Rush Limbaugh got his start in political commentary on the station in 1983. He continues to be heard on KMBZ in his live 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. time slot. For many years KMBZ also repeated Limbaugh's show overnight.\n\nKMBZ was the Royals flagship station for some time. For a time in the 1980s, it ceded flagship status to WIBW in Topeka, Kansas. In 2008, Royals games switched to co-owned sports radio station 610 KCSP. Beginning in 2009, some Royals games returned to KMBZ, when KCSP is committed to another sporting event. KMBZ is also the Kansas City affiliate for the Missouri Tigers radio network, broadcasting football, men's and women's basketball and the \"Tiger Talk\" coach's show.\n\nIn 2009, KMBZ began simulcasting its programming on the HD3 subchannel of sister station 98.1 KUDL. On March 24, 2011, Entercom announced that on March 30, KUDL's analog FM broadcasts would become a full-time simulcast of KMBZ as KMBZ-FM. On December 24, 2014, Entercom announced that the KMBZ simulcast would split on January 5, 2015. On that date, KMBZ became \"Talk 980,\" carrying mostly syndicated shows, while KMBZ-FM began airing a mostly locally oriented programming schedule.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052496", "title": "Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories", "text": "Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\n\nYertle the Turtle and Other Stories is a picture book collection by Theodor Seuss Geisel, published under his more commonly known pseudonym of Dr. Seuss. It was first released by Random House Books on April 12, 1958, and is written in Seuss's trademark style, using a type of meter called anapestic tetrameter. Though it contains three short stories, it is mostly known for its first story, \"Yertle the Turtle\", in which the eponymous Yertle, king of the pond, stands on his subjects in an attempt to reach higher than the moon—until the bottom turtle burps and he falls into the mud, ending his rule.\n\nThough the book included \"burp\", a word then considered to be relatively rude, it was a success upon publication, and has since sold more than a million copies. In 2001, it was listed at 125 on the \"Publishers Weekly\" list of the best-selling children's books of all time.\n\nThe eponymous story revolves around Yertle the Turtle, the king of the pond. Dissatisfied with the stone that serves as his throne, he commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see farther and expand his kingdom. However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him to be quiet. Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain and hunger to the turtles at the bottom of the pile. Again, Yertle yells at Mack to be quiet. Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something \"dares to be higher than Yertle the King\", he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before he can give the command, Mack decides he has had enough. He burps, which shakes up Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him \"King of the Mud\" and freeing the others.\n\nThe second story recounts the tale of the \"girl-bird\" Gertrude McFuzz, who only has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for something that will make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. But because of the added weight of too many feathers, she is unable to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, hearing her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has \"enough, because now she is smarter.\"\n\nThe third and final story tells of a rabbit and a bear, who both boast that they are the \"best of the beasts\", because of the range of their hearing and smelling abilities, respectively. However, they are humbled by a worm who claims he can see all around the world—right back to his own hill, where he sees the rabbit and bear, whom he calls \"the two biggest fools that have ever been seen\".\n\nA stack of turtles drawn similarly to those featured in \"Yertle the Turtle\" first appeared on March 20, 1942, in a cartoon for the New York City newspaper \"PM\", where Seuss worked as an editorial cartoonist. The illustration shows two stacks of turtles forming the letter \"V\" on top of a large turtle labelled \"Dawdling Producers\", with a caption reading \"You Can't Build A Substantial V Out of Turtles!\"\n\nSeuss has stated that the titular character Yertle represented Adolf Hitler, with Yertle's despotic rule of the pond and takeover of the surrounding area parallel to Hitler's regime in Germany and invasion of various parts of Europe. Though Seuss made a point of not beginning the writing of his stories with a moral in mind, stating that \"kids can see a moral coming a mile off\", he was not against writing about issues; he said \"there's an inherent moral in any story\" and remarked that he was \"subversive as hell\". \"Yertle the Turtle\" has variously been described as \"autocratic rule overturned\", \"a reaction against the fascism of World War II\", and \"subversive of authoritarian rule\".\n\nThe last lines of \"Yertle the Turtle\" read: \"And the turtles, of course ...all the turtles are free / As turtles, and maybe, all creatures should be.\" When questioned about why he wrote \"maybe\" rather than \"surely\", Seuss replied that he didn't want to sound \"didactic or like a preacher on a platform\", and that he wanted the reader \"to say 'surely' in their minds instead of my having to say it.\"\n\nThe use of the word \"burp\"—\"plain little Mack did a plain little thing. \"He burped!\"\"—was also an issue before publication. According to Seuss, the publishers at Random House, including the president, had to meet to decide whether or not they could use \"burp\" because \"nobody had ever burped before on the pages of a children's book\". However, despite the publishers' initial worries, it eventually proved to be a hit—in 2001, \"Publishers Weekly\" reported that it was 125th on the list of best-selling hardcover children's books in the United States, at just over one million copies.\nThe book is dedicated to the Sagmaster family as a tribute to Joseph Sagmaster, who had introduced Seuss to his first wife, Helen Palmer, when they were both attending Oxford University. Sagmaster is quoted as saying that bringing the two together was \"the happiest inspiration I've ever had\".\n\nAlthough \"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\" has not been directly adapted, several characters from the book have appeared in other media. Yertle is a character in the 1996–1997 television series \"The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss\", and in Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty's Broadway musical \"Seussical\", Yertle serves as a judge and Gertrude McFuzz acts as Horton's love interest. The story was also turned into a dance number in the 1994 film \"In Search of Dr. Seuss\".\n\n\"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\" is a 1992 animation directed by Ray Messecar and narrated by John Lithgow (later released and cropped to widescreen format on Blu-Ray part of \"Who's Who in the Dr. Seuss?\").\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers adapted the story in the song \"Yertle the Turtle\" on their second album, \"Freaky Styley\", released in 1985.\n\nIn 1961 RCA Camden Records released \"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\" with the three stories on the A side and \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\" on the B side. The liner notes state \"set to dramatic action personally by \"Dr. Suess\" with music featuring Marvin Miller\".\n"}

{"id": "2052512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052512", "title": "Knights of Honor (video game)", "text": "Knights of Honor (video game)\n\nKnights of Honor is a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed by Bulgarian Black Sea Studios. It was published by Sunflowers Interactive in Europe in 2004 and Paradox Entertainment in North America in 2005. The game takes place in Medieval Europe, spanning the early centuries of the second millennium in three historical time periods. The player can choose to play as one of over 100 playable kingdoms.\n\nIn 2019, a sequel titled Knights of Honor II: Sovereign is announced and the game is being developed by Black Sea Games, which consisted of former Creative Assembly Sofia employees who worked on the original game, and will be published by THQ Nordic.\n\n\"Knights of Honor\" is played on a large map of Europe spanning from Ireland to Caucasus and from Scandinavia to the northern coast of Africa. The map is divided into parcels of land called provinces. Each province is governed by a city and contains several \"Rural Areas\" which can be towns, farms, monasteries and coast towns. These rural areas can't be altered and are placed randomly across the map before each game. The city, however has room for several buildings which can give bonuses to the rural areas or the city itself, such as more piety in the monasteries when a church is built or a higher income from the towns when a market is present in the city. Other buildings are needed to recruit certain units (such as a swordsmith for sword-wielding units or a fletcher for bow-wielding units) or to defend the city such as walls and towers. A city only has limited room for buildings. Thus, not all buildings can be built in a city and the player must carefully consider what to build for a particular city. Compared to other strategy games, building structures in \"KOH\" takes a rather long time. The main goal of the game is to become emperor of Europe. However, the player is free to do whatever they wish. There is no set time limit.\n\nThere are three kinds of resources which can be spent on a variety of upgrades. Money is needed to recruits units, build buildings, etc. It is earned by taxes, trading and kingdom power. Piety is used for increasing your kingdom power and converting provinces to your religion. Books are used to educate your knights and adopting provinces. Towns themselves also generate hammers (used to construct certain buildings) and food which determines how long they can withstand sieges.\n\nReligion plays an important role in Knights of Honor. There are 4 different types of religion: The Catholic Church, The Orthodox Church, Islam, and Paganism. The catholic Pope has much influence in medieval Europe. He can excommunicate catholic kingdoms and call for crusades against non-catholic kingdoms. When a player chooses to go on a crusade they are granted powerful Crusader units. When the Pope dies, his successor is chosen among several clerics throughout Europe. If the player happens to have a very experienced cleric, there is a chance he will be chosen as Pope. From then on, the player controls the Pope and can choose to excommunicate kingdoms and call for crusades, a successful crusade can result in a puppet state that is unquestionably loyal to the leader of the crusade or plunder the town for a huge sum of gold. The Catholic Church is located in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. Orthodox factions are located in south east Europe and answer to Byzantium. These factions can declare independence and form their own churches which grants them a greater sum of gold while lacking the disadvantage of being excommunicated which results in a gold penalty. Islamic empires have the ability to call a Jihad which is similar to a Crusade and will cause armies to spawn at their borders and attack any invaders or rebels. This is a powerful ability but it has a long cool down period . Islam is found in north Africa and the middle east. Paganism is the smallest religion being found only in Scandinavia and some parts of eastern Europe. Pagans do not collect piety (a religious resource used to build certain units and buildings and perform some diplomatic options) so are free to focus on gold and are not troubled by religious problems such as religious tension but they have a penalty on their income and have bad relations with all other religions. Paganism is the only religion the player or other kingdoms cannot convert to, the only way to play as a pagan nation is to start the game as one. The player can renounce his faith and adopt another official religion (except paganism) but such religious conflict will often split the kingdom up and one must reunify the nations as a result.\n\nProvinces can have up to three attributes called \"\"province features\"\" which allow the construction of certain buildings. For instance if a province contains fertile soil, an apiary can be built in that province. These buildings give access to \"\"trade goods\"\" which have a number of positive effects on the kingdom. For example, horses allows mounted units, wine makes a population happier and silver brings in extra money. Controlling such provinces is the key to success in \"Knights of Honor\".\nBesides trade goods, which can be obtained in provinces where the right province features are present or by importing them from other kingdoms, there is another type of goods called \"\"exotic goods\"\". These goods can't be produced within a province but have to be imported by means of an admiralty, the upgraded version of a harbour. Examples are ivory, gems and spices.\nExotic goods, together with trade goods, are needed to activate so called \"\"kingdom advantages\"\". There are ten different kingdom advantages each requiring a different set of trade and exotic goods and each giving a different advantage. For instance, the kingdom advantage \"\"Secret Order\"\", which gives a bonus to spies, requires the following trade goods: columns, statues, silver and dyes and the following exotic goods: ebony and ivory.\n\nControlling many provinces certainly gives an advantage over other kingdoms not only because of more income but also because of the goods and eventually the kingdom advantages. However, larger kingdoms are harder to maintain and defend.\n\nA large community of modders created a lot of content for the game, though nowadays almost all has been lost in the closure of Sunflowers/Black Sea Studios Website. But some mods have been restored and have been recently developed thanks to the nostalgia of some players. One of them has created a mod which allow to play on new monitor resolution such as Full HD - 1920x1080 and 1366x768p. It adds many new content and tweaks. \n"}

{"id": "2052515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052515", "title": "Mr. Vampire", "text": "Mr. Vampire\n\nMr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film directed by Ricky Lau and produced by Sammo Hung. The film's box office success led to the creation of a \"Mr. Vampire\" franchise, with the release of four sequels directed by Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1992, with Lam Ching-ying as the lead for the majority of them. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore (similar to both zombies and vampires). The film was released under the Chinese title (literally: \"Hold Your Breath for a Moment\") in Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.\n\nIn Republican-era China, Master Kau makes a living as a Taoist priest who performs magic that maintains control over spirits and irrepressible vampires. Together with his inept students, Man-choi and Chau-sang, he resides in a large house protected from the spiritual world with talismans and amulets.\n\nOne day, he accepts an assignment from a wealthy businessman, Yam, to remove Yam's deceased father from his grave and rebury him, with the hopes that doing so will bring more prosperity to the Yam family. However, during the raising of the coffin, Kau notices the body, instead of in a decomposed state, is still intact. Knowing it has become a vampire, he has it moved to his house for further study.\n\nOnce in the house, Choi and Sang line the coffin with enchanted ink to safeguard the body, but forget to line the bottom of the coffin, causing the vampire to break out. It heads straight for Yam's home and savagely kills his son before going into hiding by dawn.\n\nWai, an incompetent police inspector who is smitten with Yam's daughter Ting, blames Kau for murdering Yam and arrests him. Kau is imprisoned and Yam's body is placed in a makeshift morgue near the jailhouse. Choi stays at Yam's house to protect Ting while Sang frees his master, only to witness Yam reawakening as a vampire. Kau and Sang manage to kill it after engaging it in battle. Wai realizes his mistake in framing Kau earlier and accepts the fact that another vampire is on the loose.\n\nThe vampire again invades Yam's house. Kau and Sang arrive in time to wound it and forcing it to flee, but not before it critically wounds Choi. Kau invites Ting to stay at his house for safety. The next morning, after examining Choi's wounds, Kau claims he too may become a vampire. He orders Sang to feed Choi glutinous rice, claiming it may decrease the vampire's venom in Choi's body and bring him back to his normal state. While purchasing the rice, however, the shady merchant deliberately mixes different kinds of rice in the bag, and an unwitting Sang accepts it. Before Sang can get home, he is lured by a mysterious woman into her house. He soon deduces she is a spirit, but she uses her supernatural power to seduce him. They sleep together for the night.\n\nWhen Sang returns to Kau's house, the priest is quick to notice his student's predicament. That night, he silently follows Sang to the spirit's house. The spirit transforms into a hideous ghoul and attempts to kill Kau, but fails at the hands of his talismans. She bewitches Sang to turn on his master, but after a brief fight, Kau breaks the spell and she escapes.\n\nThe next night, Kau ties Sang to a chair and prepares to capture and eliminate the spirit. Sure enough, she arrives at their house and Kau chases her throughout. As Sang tries to free himself, Choi turns into a vampire and attacks him. Amidst the chaos, Kau restrains Choi and almost terminates the spirit, but stops when Sang begs him to let her go. Saddened she can no longer be with Sang, the spirit flies away.\n\nOver the next few days, Kau restores Choi's health and turns him back to human. Wai brings in news that the vampire is now active again. When Kau leaves to investigate, the vampire, now in an almost demonic form, invades Kau's place. After pushing Choi off a balcony, it turns its attention to Ting and Wai, but Kau and Sang again divert its attention. Finally, Kau's fellow Taoist priest, Four Eyes, shows up by coincidence, and they manage to destroy the vampire by burning it alive.\n\n\nDirector Ricky Lau wanted a fresh-faced girl whom people were unfamiliar with to play the role of Mr Yam's daughter so he avoided choosing a well-known actress. He spotted dancer Moon Lee at a performance and approached her and asked \"Are you interested in acting as you'd fit into a part I have?\"\n\nLam Ching-ying was recommend to the director by Sammo Hung to play the main role. The director had seen Lam before on The Prodigal Son which the director had worked on. The director noted in an interview that \"He seems cold but actually he is with a good heart\" that was why he was suitable for the role.\n\nThe director had still not settled the actress to play ghost's role. The role ended up going to Wong Siu-fung, who impressed Ricky Lau in her previous film 'Person at the end'. Chin Siu-ho was chosen because he knew Kung Fu and all about action scenes. The Director noted in an interview \"he was serious and used no stuntman.\"\n\nSammo Hung (producer) hired Billy Lau to provide additional comedy to Mr vampire.\n\nAccording to the producer Sammo Hung, the idea for \"Mr. Vampire\" originated through childhood stories he heard from his mother who was also an actress. One of the major sources of inspiration for the film \"Mr. Vampire\" came from a collection of supernatural tales called \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\" by Qing Dynasty writer Pu Songling. \"Mr. Vampire\" is based on a story of a resurrected corpse. The script was not written by Ricky Lau alone. It was written by many script writers, including Roy Szeto (Chak Han), Wong Ying and Barry Wong (Ping-Yiu). When the script was finished, Eric Tsang reviewed it. Sammo Hung also reviewed it and gave Lau some ideas.\n\nIn an interview the director mentioned \"Compared with nowadays, the situation was different because now they often use less time to finish the script.\" In the original script, the ghost (Jade) was written to die during the film but during filming, Lau decided to change the ending and keep her alive so that could it would be more romantic.\n\nThe director and writers used a cheap gimmick only once, when they made a man in poor quality gorilla suit chase the characters down a mountain.\n\nFilming lasted more than five months to almost half a year. On the set, the actors would sometimes crack jokes, and if director Ricky Lau liked them, he would retain those scenes in the film. The love scene that contained no violence took two weeks to complete, in addition to a further three weeks of shooting in Taiwan.\n\nThe production team built a village that appeared in the opening and ending scenes of the film, while a few scenes were shot on a standing set near Taipei because they lacked a good studio set of a long street running into the distance, which could be done by CGI in more recent times. The scene in which a dead body was found was shot in Taiwan on a set with stone arches. In that set, a real street was constructed from stone, and has been reused for other films and television series. In Hong Kong, most studios could not afford a standing set. It took one week in Taiwan to set up the sets mentioned above. The Golden Harvest studios were used as the set for the scene where Master Kau is in jail.\n\nThe scene where the body is being exhumed was filmed just out of the New Territories in Hong Kong. The background has been used in movies such as \"The Young Master\" and the end fight in \"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\". Also filmed in the New Territories were scenes where the police went to find the vampire in the cave and the scene in which a body is being burnt.\n\nProducer Sammo Hung visited the set less frequently to promote a relaxed atmosphere as he was aware that his presence may make the cast and crew nervous. Hung took a hands-off role on the film and entrusted Mr Vampire to protégé director Ricky Lau.\n\nA real snake was used in the scene which showed one being cut, and was later used to make snake soup. This was because the production team could not afford a fake snake. This was also the case in a scene where a chicken's blood is needed and its throat is cut and a bowl is held under its neck to collect the blood.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" is set in the Early Republic, as can be seen from the five-coloured-star cap emblems on the \"modern\" uniforms, but the vampire's costume belonged to the previous dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, contrary to a commentator's notes. Oddly in one scene after Chau-sang woke up, Ting-ting had a white flower in her hair which signifies morning but it is night time in the film.\n\nAction scenes in the movie were designed by both the director and Chiny-Ying, who was an action director as well. There wasn't much time for the director and actors to sleep. The director and actors had 2 shifts (12 hours per shift). The Day shift is from seven in the morning till seven in the evening. The Night shift is from seven in the evening work till seven in the morning and many actors didn't really sleep for maybe two weeks.\nDuring filming in the extremely hot summer months, Yuen Wah suffered as he was not allowed to remove the plastic from his face. After several hours in the make-up chair, he would spend the working day unable to move, talk or eat properly. Ironically, Ricky Lau cut out many of Yuen's footage from the finished film, as he felt that too many vampire hopping would slow down the pace. \nNear the end of shooting, \"Mr. Vampire\", the cast and crew came under pressure to work faster, as the movie screening was around the corner.\n\nMoon Lee recalls the \"Mr. Vampire\" shoot as a largely enjoyable experience. Lam Ching Ying always looked serious during filming. He was dedicated and professional, although friends have brought up his sense of humour.\n\nIt is long been rumoured that Hung effectively directed Mr Vampire on his own with the inexperienced Ricky Lau serving as his assistant. Hung has always denied the story and Chin Siu Ho has confirmed Ricky Lau as the true director of \"Mr. Vampire\".\n\nAt different parts of the movie, wires were used. The production staff had to take care of the wires. To ensure they do not show on screen, they would spray the wires in the same colour as the set background. If the wires were shown, they would have to take it overseas for editing which was not popular at that time. However, no wires were used in the scene where actor Chin Siu-ho performed a back-flip up the door.\n\nAction director Yuen Wah doubled as a vampire for some of the more acrobatic shots, such as the end scene depicting the vampire being burnt (the flames and oil were real).\n\nMost of \"Mr. Vampire\" atmospheric scores that were both spooky and humorous was mainly supplied by Anders Nelsson's music production company The Melody Bank. Jade's theme song, \"Gwai San Noeng\" (鬼新娘; \"Ghost Bride\"), was performed by the Jie'er Choir (傑兒合唱團). The music was written by Lee On-Tat and lyrics were written by Cheng Kwok-Kong.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was originally given a budget of HKD 4.5 million, but halfway through production, it was already depleted. The director then had to ask for more money and was given a further HKD 1 million to finish the film. After one week, the money was also spent. When the film was finally finished, it cost HKD 8.5 million. Sammo estimated the film would cost a HKD 2 to 3 million loss to Golden Harvest\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was nominated for thirteen awards, including two for Best Supporting Actor (Billy Lau and Lam Ching-ying). Out of the thirteen nominations the film only received one award for Best Original Film Score.\n\n\"Mr, Vampire\" ran in cinemas from 7 November 1985 to 4 December 1985 and grossed a total of HK$20,092,129. This was the same year that Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan's movies were at the box office, with \"My Lucky Stars\", \"Police Story\" and \"Heart of Dragon\" all exceeding \n\"Mr. Vampire\" considerable takings.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was given a midnight premier at Grand Ocean (Hong Kong). The director was so worried about the success of this movie as well as his directing career, he stood outside during the screening, greeting guests until he heard the audience starting to laugh.\n\nSino Cine Co Ltd bought the UK distribution rights to \"Mr. Vampire\" and the BBFC classified the film as '15' without any cuts and then it was released March 1986. The following year Chinatown Cinema bought the Australia distribution rights and the movie was classified 'M'(mature no one under the age of 15) it was classified 1 January 1986\n\nIn Canada the Manitoba Film Classification Board classified the film as 14 for Festival Cinema, Ontario Film Review Board classified \"Mr. Vampire\" 1 April 1986 as Restricted (18 years of age or older) and Régie du cinéma du Québec was classified 1986 as 14 and then reclassified 9 September 2004 as Visa général (General Rating, all ages)\n\nIn Singapore the movie was cut and classified as PG and later was reclassified to NC16 (Not suitable for children under 16)\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was well received in Taiwan, southeast Asia, and especially in Japan, where it inspired a vampire craze with toys and a lot of other merchandise that had a vampire on them.\n\nThe film was featured as part of Channel 4's Chinese Ghost Story season in 1990 introduced by Johnathan Ross being played alongside some similar movies in the genre including \"Encounters of the Spooky Kind\", \"Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain\", \"Esprit d'amour\", \"Spiritual Love\" and \"Rouge\".\n\nIn a DVD commentary of \"Mr. Vampire\", Bey Logan said \"\"Mr. Vampire\" is very basic visual effects and was only really the start of visual effects in Hong Kong filmmaking.\"\n\nLoveHKFilm described it as \"quite possibly the seminal entry in HK's famous horror-comedy genre\" and \"a fun movie that showcases Lam Ching-Ying at his best.\"\n\nThe English language soundtrack made for Mr vampire is low quality, redubbing the characters with bland mid American accents. The sound effects are inadequate, clomping footsteps are added as a distracting effect. This version of the film is not widely circulated.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" made the Hong Kong Film Archive's \"100 Must-See Hong Kong Movies\" at number 77.\n\nGolden Harvest attempted to make an English-language version of \"Mr. Vampire\" under the title \"Demon Hunters\". The film was produced by David Chan. However, the team could not get Lam Ching-ying to reprise his role because the latter was busy with another film overseas. Yuen Wah, who worked on the original \"Mr. Vampire\", replaced Lam and handled the action sequences as well. American actor Jack Scalia, who acted in the 1978 television series \"Dallas\", was also recruited into the cast.\n\nInitially Tanya Roberts from \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"Sheena: Queen of the Jungle\" was chosen but it did not work out so she was replaced by Michelle Phillips, a singer from the vocal group The Mamas & the Papas. They all flew out to Hong Kong to start filming at Golden Harvest studios. After several weeks filming was abandoned because Yuen Wah could not speak English very well. Raymond Chow pulled the plug, saying \"we started but we need not finish\". The Demon Hunters filmed footage still exists and is kept in Golden Harvest's archives.\n\nSince the failed English version of \"Mr. Vampire\" Michelle Yeoh's company, Han Entertainment, is planning to do a similar movie.\n\nHighly successful at the time, both in Hong Kong and as a cult film favourite with overseas enthusiasts of Hong Kong cinema, It inspired numerous parodies and homage films. The film launched Lam Ching-ying's character, the unibrowed Taoist exorcist, whom he would portray not only in the \"Mr. Vampire\" sequels, but also in many other films, including unrelated ones.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" sequels included \"Mr. Vampire II\", \"Mr. Vampire III\" and \"Mr. Vampire IV\". However, most do not relate to the first film, instead simply being set on the same themes. There is in fact only one canonical sequel, Ricky Lau's own \"Mr. Vampire 1992\". Confusion regarding the sequels has been compounded not only by the names of the films but also by the fact that the films share some cast members, though often recast in different roles. There are also other films of the Chinese vampire genre starring Lam Ching-ying, such as \"Encounters of the Spooky Kind II\" (1990) and \"Magic Cop\" (1990), or directed by Lam himself, such as \"Vampire vs Vampire\" (1989), which are all separate from the \"Mr. Vampire\" franchise. In addition, Lam uses his real name for his character in some of the films he acted in.\n\nA related television series titled \"Vampire Expert\" (殭屍道長) starring Lam Ching-ying was broadcast from 1996 to 1997. However, during the filming of the third season, Lam developed liver cancer and died before the project was completed. The first season of \"My Date with a Vampire\", a television series produced by ATV, was specially dedicated to Lam, and the story was based on future events in \"Vampire Expert\".\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was adapted into a theatrical play and was performed at the Cultural Centre's Studio Theatre in Hong Kong from 29 to 31 October 2010 as part of a Halloween theme and New Vision Arts Festival. Tang Lok-yin is the music director/composer for this play with Pun Siu-fai as the choreographer.\n\nThe inspiration for this play was that of the music directors in an interview he said that when he was a child he watch a lot of Lam Ching-Ying's movies with his younger brother. She also mentioned Lam had played a Taoist priest in the \"Mr. Vampire\" series and that is the inspiration behind the director's contemporary musical dance theatre. She also said she was sort of forced into watching the movies because her parents are big fans.\n\nOn the stage it is decorated with six coffins and a large moon on top, \"Mr. Vampire\" the play begins with the suicide of a grief-stricken woman. The play shows the audience the popular understanding of qi (breath) and the mythical consequences if it does not leave the body of a person who dies in grudge, The play then portray love and hate with the use of animalistic dancers alternating between kissing and biting each other. The show then transforms into a performance of similar to that of Michael Jackson's music videos Thriller and Beat It before turning into the rage of the grudging beings.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was made into a Japanese video game entitled \"Reigen Doushi\" it was published by Pony Canyon and certain scenes in the game were taken from the movie. The video game was released on Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan 16 September 1988 and in the United States 1 April 1990 under the title \"Phantom Fighter\" by the publisher FCI Inc and the Developer Marionette.\nA number Japanese board games that relate to \"Mr. Vampire\" were released in Japan.\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" has been screened numerous times in since its release screening include:\n\n\n\"Mr. Vampire\" was previously available on Netflix and Sky Player (now Sky Go).\n\n\n"}

It was released on August 9, 2005, debuted at number 1 with first week sales of 185,000 copies, and has spawned 1 big hit single along with three moderately successful singles on rock radio. Its first single \"Right Here\" was the most successful at both rock and pop stations and it was used in a video package by World Wrestling Entertainment commemorating wrestler Edge after he won his first WWE Championship. \"Falling\" and \"Everything Changes\" have also been released with accompanying videos.\n\nLead singer Aaron Lewis has stated that he thinks 'Chapter V is the best record the band has released to date', and the album continues the evolution from the messages on \"14 Shades of Grey\" to messages of hope and uncertainty. It also showcases a heavier side to the band on selected tracks (reminiscent of some content on \"Dysfunction\"), and emphasizes a balance between both styles of the band's sound. The album includes a track called \"Paper Jesus\" targeted at record company executives who idolize money instead of music and \"Reply\", an open letter replying to fan mail that Aaron Lewis and the rest of the band have received over the years (the original version can be found on the Special Edition).\n\nSince its release, it has sold 1,200,000 copies in the United States and 1,500,000 worldwide. However, it marked Staind's lowest debut so far in the UK, at number 112. All the same, it was regarded as one of the most anticipated albums of the year in the U.S. before its release. A special edition, with five bonus tracks, an extra booklet and a DVD was released several months later. Even after a full year, it remained fairly consistent on the Billboard 200. Aaron Lewis has said in relation to this in the booklet of the Special Edition of the album: \"Having three straight number one albums was a nice big fuck you to a lot of people who have slagged us. Nobody can ever take away that fact.\"\n\nStaind have promoted the album by allowing selected fans to preview it on their tour bus, and touring after its release for a whole year, including mini tours to Australia and solo tours across Europe, as well as the famous Fall Brawl Tour with Flyleaf, Taproot and P.O.D. The band have also toured with 3 Doors Down, Hurt, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and Seether (later cancelled) across the United States to promote the album.\n\nInitial critical response ranged from mixed to average. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 48, based on 10 reviews.\n\n\nProduction\n\n"}

It was published in February 1995 in North America and during the same year in Europe, within the waning days of the platform lifespan.\n\nThe game is a semi-sequel to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game \"Eternal Champions\" and was part two of a proposed trilogy of games by Sega. Both games were developed by an internal team at Sega Interactive Development Division and designed by Michael Lantham, a developer with Sega of America from their early days.\n\n\"Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side\" includes the nine playable fighters and non-playable boss from the first game, and adds 13 new playable characters (nine of which are hidden) and a new boss. Also, new moves called \"Cinekills\" were added, which are essentially fatality scenes rendered in full motion video.\n\n\"Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side\" makes most special attacks use less of the special attack meter than in the previous game. There are also some special attacks that do not deplete the special attack meter. Combo attacks are also introduced, and jumping attacks can be linked to ground attacks and most normal attacks can be linked to other normal attacks. Mild \"juggle\" combos can also be executed by landing an additional hit on an already aerial opponent.\n\nThe game also includes three new types of finishing moves. The first is a second \"Overkill\" in each stage, called \"Sudden Death\", that can be activated when the victim still has a little life left. The other two, \"Vendetta\" and \"Cinekill\", can be performed on a dazed opponent that has 20% or less of their life in the final round only. Sudden Deaths and Vendettas are often exceptionally gory, and the original Overkills were made gorier to match. During Overkills (and Sudden Deaths), the winning fighter is carried off the stage in a flash of light the moment the fateful blow was made. The game retains the stage-specific finishing moves called Overkills from the first \"Eternal Champions\", and added ones for the new stages. These are performed by defeating the player's opponent in a way that ensures that they fall upon a certain area of ground. If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear and some element of the background kills them.\n\nThe Vendetta is performed by motion and button presses identical to those used in a \"Mortal Kombat\" Fatality. Each character (except the unlockable animal characters) has their own Vendetta and each is performed differently.\n\nCinekills are triggered when the dominant player has earned (through successful combo attacks) temporarily unlimited inner strength/energy, the victim's health is 20% or lower, and the victim is stunned. In a Cinekill, the Dark Champion appears on the field and kills the victim in a full motion video cutscene that supposedly mimics the victim's greatest fear. Certain characters have the ability to combo into this style of finishing move, such as Trident who has an elaborate re-dizzy combo that culminates in a Cinekill. Only the base characters can receive Cinekills, though any character can trigger one. This type of finish activates automatically.\n\nLike the first game, \"Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side\" follows the story of the Eternal Champion, who felt the balance of the universe and time had been disturbed by the deaths of key individuals who had been destined to change the world for the greater good. To restore the balance, he held a great contest in which the winner would be granted the gift of new life, allowing them to fulfill their rightful destiny.\n\nIn this second chapter, it is revealed that the Eternal Champion has an evil counterpart: the Dark Champion. The Dark Champion appears and declares that he also will enter the contest and that he has hidden four more warriors, preventing the contest from truly being fulfilled. The contestants must not only achieve the aims of the Eternal Champion but also face the Dark Champion if they want their lives back.\n\n\"Challenge from the Dark Side\" includes all nine playable characters from the first \"Eternal Champions\". New fighters include Riptide, a pirate from 1566 A.D.; Ramses III; an Egyptian pharaoh from 151 B.C.; Raven Gindhar, a voodoo priestess from 1802 A.D.; and Dawson McShane, a gambler from 1849 A.D. The game features multiple secret fighters including the Eternal Champion and the Dark Champion, along with Thomas \"Blast\" Chavez, a Green Beret from 1955 A.D.; Chin Wo, an acupuncturist and healer from 1815 A.D.; and Thanatos, the former Greek God of Death from 1692 A.D. In addition, six hidden joke characters can be unlocked, consisting of five animals (Hooter the Owl, Yappy the Dog, Crispy the Chicken, Zuni the Monkey, and Slither the Rattlesnake) and a parody fighter known as the Senator.\n\nBoth Blast and Chin Wo were originally intended for inclusion in the first \"Eternal Champions\" video game for the Sega Genesis, but had to be omitted due to memory limitations with the cartridge.\n\n\"Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side\" was the first game to carry Sega's internal Deep Water warning icon label, which was employed by Sega of America for games featuring adult content. In North America, the game earned an \"M\" (for Mature) rating from for its graphic violence and gore from the freshly-introduced IDSA system (later ESRB). In Europe, it earned both an 18+ ELSPA rating and a 15 BBFC rating.\n\n\"GamePro\" gave the game a mixed review. They highly approved of the stage designs and said the rendered cinematics \"offer a nice alternative to the full-motion, live-action video prevalent on Sega CDs.\" However, they criticized that the game has only minor enhancements over the original Genesis game, and concluded with a reference to the Sega CD's \"Welcome to the next level\" advertising slogan: \"Instead of taking us to the next level, EC has merely taken us to a different part of the same one.\" \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it a 6.125 out of 10, with Ed Semrad summarizing it as \"simply a hodgepodge of fatalities strewn across a poor fighting game.\" The other three members of the \"EGM\" review panel concurred that Sega seemed to be trying to draw attention away from the loose controls, sluggish combat, inappropriate audio, and lack of improvement from the first \"Eternal Champions\" using flashy fatality sequences. Though some of them found the fatalities entertaining, they said they were not enough to give the game any sort of lasting appeal.\n\nRetro gaming website Racketboy included it among the games that \"defined\" the Sega CD, noting that \"Even though the Sega CD was a commercial failure, \"Challenge from the Dark Side\" sold better in the U.S. than the Genesis versions of \"Street Fighter II\".\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that what Sega did was \"take a good game, and use the inexpensive storage capacity of CD to add surprises until they build something people will be digging stuff out of for years. Very cool.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2052551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052551", "title": "Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)", "text": "Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)\n\nSymphony No. 9 in D minor is the last symphony on which Anton Bruckner worked, leaving the last movement incomplete at the time of his death in 1896; Bruckner dedicated it \"to the beloved God\" (in German, \"dem lieben Gott\"). The symphony was premiered under Ferdinand Löwe in Vienna in 1903.\n\n\"(Disambiguation note: While logical to name this \"Symphony in D minor, opus posthumous\", that name usually refers to the \"nullified\" Symphony in D minor.)\"\n\nBruckner is said to have dedicated his Ninth Symphony to \"the beloved God\". August Göllerich and Max Auer, in their biography of Bruckner, \"Ein Lebens- und Schaffensbild,\" claim he expressed to his doctor, Richard Heller, this dedication of his work saying:\n\nImmediately after completing the first version of his Eighth Symphony on 10 August 1887, Bruckner began work on his Ninth. First draft sketches, which are stored in the Jagiellońska Library, Kraków, are dated 12–18 August 1887. Additionally, the first score of the first movement is dated 21 September 1887.\n\nHowever, the work on the first movement was soon interrupted. The conductor Hermann Levi, to whom Bruckner had just sent the score of his Eighth, found the orchestration impossible and the working-out of the themes \"dubious\", suggesting that Bruckner rework it. Bruckner set to revising it in 1888. During the revision of his Eighth, he also revised his Third Symphony from March 1888 to March 1889.\n\nIn the midst of revising his Eighth and Third, on 12 February 1889, Bruckner began to prepare his Second Symphony for publication. On 10 March 1890, he completed his Eighth before making further revisions of his First and Fourth Symphonies and his F minor Mass.\n\nBruckner announced in a letter dated February 18, 1891 to the reviewer Theodor Helm, \"Loud secrets today. H. Doctor! [...] 3rd secret. The Ninth Symphony (D minor) has begun.\" concealing the fact that his first sketches of the Ninth had been written nearly four years earlier. Bruckner then composed two choral-symphonic works, a setting of the 150th Psalm (1892) and the male choral work Helgoland (1893).\n\nOn 23 December 1893, the first movement of the Ninth was completed after six years. The Scherzo (second movement), sketched as early as 1889, was completed on 15 February 1894. Bruckner composed three successive versions of the \"Trio\":\n\n\nThe Adagio (third movement) was completed on 30 November 1894. With regard to the final movement, the following entry can be found in Bruckner's calendar: \"24. Mai [1]895 1.mal Finale neue Scitze\". Overall, the work on the Ninth stretched over the long period from 1887 to 1896 and had to be interrupted repeatedly due to revisions to other works and Bruckner's deteriorating health. Bruckner died during the work on the fourth movement, before completing the symphony.\n\nThe first three movements of the Ninth were premiered in Vienna, in the Wiener Musikvereinssaal on 11 February 1903 by the Wiener Concertvereinsorchester, the precursor of the Wiener Symphoniker (Vienna Symphony), under the conductor Ferdinand Löwe in his own arrangement. Löwe profoundly changed Bruckner's original score by adapting Bruckner's orchestration in the sense of a rapprochement with Wagner's ideal of sound, and made changes to Bruckner's harmony in certain passages (most notably in the climax of the Adagio). He published his altered version without comment, and this edition was long regarded as Bruckner's original. In 1931, the musicologist Robert Haas pointed out the differences between Löwe's edition and Bruckner's original manuscripts. The following year, conductor Siegmund von Hausegger performed both the Löwe-edited and the original Bruckner score, so that the \"actual premiere\" of the first three movements of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony took place on 2 April 1932 in Munich. The first recording (issued on LP in the 1950s) was made by Hausegger with the Munich Philharmonic in the original version (edited by Alfred Orel) in April 1938.\n\nBruckner's Ninth Symphony represents an important link between late romanticism and modernity. With the Ninth, Bruckner not only opens up new soundscapes through the emancipation of dissonance that Wagner had already achieved, but also achieves a new dimension by separating individual chords from once firmly established sound connections in the harmony, as it is continued, for example, by Arnold Schoenberg. On the long symphonic tracks (negative sound of silence - sequencing phase - widened peak - decay process) Bruckner expands the form extremely. Thus, Bruckner's use of structure in his Ninth Symphony makes him a pioneer of modernism.\n\nAs pointed out by Hans-Hubert Schönzeler, Bruckner had \"his roots in the music of Palestrina, Bach, Beethoven, [and] Schubert\". At the same time, however, Bruckner is also regarded as one of the key innovators of late 19th-century harmony alongside Franz Liszt. In the Ninth Symphony, Bruckner consistently continues his chosen symphonic path by adhering to the sonata form (extended to the third theme). At the same time he expands the form and enhances it to the monumental. The expansion of the orchestra apparatus is also an expression of this mass increase. The Bruckner researcher Alfred Orel states:\n\nAccording to Ekkehard Kreft, \"the phases of improvement in the Ninth Symphony take on a new significance, as they serve to shape the character from the starting point of the thematic complex (first theme) to its final destination (main theme).\" Both in the first sentence and in the final movement this is expressed in a hitherto unknown dimension. The entry of the main theme is preceded by a harmoniously complicated increase phase. The use of this increasingly complex harmony makes Bruckner the pioneer of later developments. The musicologist Albrecht von Mossow summarizes this with regard to the Ninth as follows: \"To the material developments of modernity must be attributed to Bruckner as with other composers of the 19th century, the increasing emancipation of dissonance, the chromatization of harmony, the weakening of tonality, the touch of the Triadic harmonics through the increased inclusion of four- and five-tone sounds, the formal breaks within his symphonic movements, and the revaluation of timbre to an almost independent parameter.\"\n\nIn the Ninth Symphony, the great waves of increase frequently lead to a subsequent process of decay. The music psychologist Ernst Kurth expresses this process of development, climax and decay, and speaks of the \"inner space symbolism of a contrast of sound-specific breadth and emptiness compared to the previous compression and summit position.\" In his book on Bruckner, he draws the immediate parallel to Stockhausen, \"and to his half-hour work 'Gruppen' (1957) for three orchestras, because structure is likewise not so much in the linear genesis, but in the tearing, the dismemberment of the individual apparatus will be shown. As with Bruckner, it is not just about the transfer of the spatial sound conception on the instrumental apparatus, often referred to by interpreters as 'registration', but also to the wealth of types of sound, of colors, of characters.\"\n\nThe fugue is extraordinary for its prominent position in the final movement of the Ninth Symphony, although the inclusion of a fugue in the symphonic context of Bruckner is not uncommon. As Rainer Bloss explained (as translated from German): \"The main theme of the finale of the 9th Symphony has a peculiarity, because its form is changed, transformed in its last two bars. . . . Bruckner's 'unusual' two-bar extension demonstrates this modular regression exceptionally\".\n\nBruckner increasingly refines his technique of citation in the Ninth Symphony. Paul Thissen sums it up in his analysis (translated from German): \"Undoubtedly, the form of integration of quotations used by Bruckner in the Adagio of the Ninth Symphony shows the most differentiated appearance. It ranges from mere montage technique (as in Miserere) to the penetration of the sequence with transformations similar to Kyrie\".\n\nThe symphony has four movements, although the finale is incomplete and fragmentary:\n\nMuch material for the finale in full score may have been lost very soon after the composer's death; some of the lost sections in full score survived only in two-to-four-stave sketch format. The placement of the Scherzo second, and the key, D minor, are only two of the elements this work has in common with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nThe symphony is so often performed without any sort of finale that some authors describe \"the form of this symphony [as] … a massive arch, two slow movements straddling an energetic Scherzo.\"\n\nThe score calls for three each of flutes, oboes, clarinets in B and A, bassoons, trumpets in F, and trombones, with eight horns (the fifth-eighth horns doubling on Wagner tubas), contrabass tuba, timpani and strings.\n\n\nThe first movement in D minor (alla breve) is a freely designed sonata movement with three thematic groups. At the beginning, the strings in the tremolo intone the root note D, which is solidified in the third bar by the woodwinds. A first thematic nucleus sounds in the horns as a \"(fundamental) tone repetition in the triple-dotted rhythm, from which the interval of the third, then the fifth dissolves, fits into the underlying metric order structure by caesurating strokes of the timpani and trumpets. A symphony can hardly begin more primitive, elemental, archetypal.\" The typical phenomenon of sound splitting for Bruckner occurs in bar 19: the root note D is dissociated into its neighboring notes E and D. A bold E major upswing of the horns announces something auspicious. As a result, an extended development phase prepares the entry of the main theme. Manfred Wagner points to the specificity of Bruckner's music, which underlies the principle of development and the exploration of sound: \"Bruckner still believes in the compelling musical thought, but concludes it as the culmination of development, but he knows that in the future it will be much more about the circumstances, how something will be than what it will be.\" Bruckner's path to this theme creation is getting longer; it takes more and more time for the main idea to break out.\n\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nThe powerful main theme in the first movement impresses as the D minor sound space is first confirmed by the rhythmically striking octave transposition of the notes D and A, with a sudden deviation of the sound to C major, reinterpreted as a dominant to E minor. The theme follows a multiple cadence over C major and G minor to A major, and finally to D major, seeming to enter its decay phase, yet simultaneously transitioning to the lyrically cantabile side theme – the so-called singing period. This interval of falling in succession, which also plays a role in the unfinished fourth movement, forms an integral part of the lead motif of the singing period. Subsequently, Bruckner composes a pristine transitional phase, which is closely repeated between the second and third theme groups.\n\nThe second theme group shifts the music to A major and begins quietly. This section is played more slowly than the first and the violins carry the initial theme:\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\n\nThe third theme group returns to D minor and prominently features the horns.\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nThis third theme group, with its five-four motif, has a strong affinity with the theme of \"Te Deum\" recurring in the finale. At the end of the transition, there is a pause on the note F, implemented seamlessly.\n\nWith regard to the formal design of the development and the subsequent reprise, Bruckner takes his symphonic path a step further by not separating the two parts, but merging them. As Alfred Orel emphasizes (translated from the German):\n\nFinally, a summit point is reached in the third part of the main theme when a repeated transfer is omitted. An organ point, on the note A, slows down the movement and prepares the varied page set. The seemingly incomplete reprise begins; the three-part sonata form here returns to its original bipartite nature. The coda again dominates the material of the main theme, which is enhanced by a persistent, punctuated rhythm and the repeated juxtaposition of E major and D minor to a provisional, yet to be released apotheosis.\n\nBruckner's tendency to telescope sonata form development and recapitulation finds its fullest realization in this movement, the form of which Robert Simpson describes as \"Statement, Counterstatement and Coda\". An unusually large number of motifs are given in the first subject group, and these are substantially and richly developed on restatement and in the coda. The main theme of the movement, which is given by the full orchestra, contains an octave fall that is effectively in a quadruple-dotted rhythm (a whole note tied to triple-dotted half note).\n\nBruckner also cites material from his earlier works: at a point near the coda, Bruckner quotes a passage from the first movement of his Seventh Symphony. The concluding page of the movement, in addition to the usual tonic (I) and dominant (V) chords, given out in a blaze of open fifths, uses a Neapolitan flat (II; the rising E figure from bar 19) in grinding dissonance with both I and V.\n\nThe Scherzo in D minor () unusually begins with an empty bar. After this pause, the woodwinds intone a distinctive rhythmic dissonance chord with the sounds E, G, B and C. This chord can be analyzed in several ways. The musicologist Wolfram Steineck gives the following explanation: \"As undoubtedly the turn to C sharp minor can be heard, it is from the beginning also dominantly related to D minor, so at least ambiguous. [...] It is the dominant note A, which is split into its two surrounding halftones and gives the sound its characteristic subdominant character, without taking the dominant part.\" Here, too, the phenomenon of tone splitting is significant. However, while the tone dissociation in the first movement concerned the tonic and was relatively late, in the Scherzo, immediately at the beginning, the note A located in the center of a dominant A major sixth chord is split into its neighbors G and B. The frame interval of this chord is the sixth, which is thematically and structurally woven in the Ninth.\n\n\\relative c {\n</score>\n\nIn his sketch on 4 January 1889, Bruckner's comment can be found: \"E Fund[ament] Vorhalt auf Dom\"; thus, according to Steinbeck, \"the sound is also theoretic on E, but is dominant, e.g. 'Vorhalt' to the A major sound and thus stands in the fifth interval...\". However, this characteristic chord can also be heard as a double-diminished fifth chord on C with a highly advanced fourth G, which is a ladder in harmonic minor on the seventeenth degree. In the end, his target point is the tone D or a D minor context, which is then reached after a complicated harmonic development phase. Almost violently, the Scherzo theme breaks through, energetically throbbing and contrasting with the ghostly introductory theme. In the middle part, the thematic material is further varied and receives an elegiac and sometimes even dance-like tone, after a return to the beginning of an energetic coda purposefully concludes.\n\nBruckner has composed three successive versions of the \"Trio\":\n\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nThe three-part Adagio in E major () \"has experienced innumerable interpretations seeking to describe its mood and will undoubtedly experience these in the future.\" For example, Göllerich and Auer see the beginning \"in the bleak mood of the erring Parsifal (the prelude to Richard Wagner's Third Act of the Dedication Festival).\" In terms of compositional analysis, the phenomenon of tone splitting plays an integral role in this movement's beginning. The initial tone B is split or differs in its two neighboring notes C and A, whereby the distinctive ninth interval jump gives the beginning of the movement an intensive sound charge. The following chromatic downhill C, B, A, leads to a sudden crash of octaves, followed by diatonic upright phrases ending in a plaintive tone. Just as there is no other Scherzo by Bruckner that begins with a composed pause, Bruckner has composed \"no other Adagio that raises without any accompaniment, [yet] with a unanimous melodic movement.\" However, this movement beginning was by no means planned from the beginning, as Bruckner's sketches and drafts prove. The rest of the strings and the Wagner tubas set themselves in full tone on the third beat of the second bar. The latter are used here for the first time in the Ninth Symphony, a delayed method Bruckner has used in his Seventh Symphony. Here, at the beginning of his mourning song for the death of Wagner, Bruckner calls for these instruments to enter, with their round and dark sound, for the first time. Unlike in the Ninth, however, the Adagio of the Seventh already begins with a full chord accompaniment. While in the Seventh, the basic key of C minor is set from the beginning, the basic key of E major in the Ninth is initially completely avoided, only called forth after a lengthy delay.\n\nThe striking, second part of the motif shows echoes of the so-called Dresden amen. As Clemens Brinkmann states in principle: \"Under the influence of Mendelssohn and Wagner, Bruckner used the 'Dresden amen' in his church music and symphonic works\". The third, brooding motif in pianissimo is marked by the \"tired seconds of the double basses.\" In a lament, the first oboe swings up and becomes part of a sequencing phase that spirals steadily, eventually leading to the eruption of the fourth motif: a pentatonic trumpet call repeated in this key [E major] seven times [in each measure] without ever being modified \" is presented on a tonally aimless chord face resulting from a multiple quintuplet. Michael Adensamer explains this in detail: \"One could interpret at least four keys from this layering (E major, B major, C sharp minor and F sharp minor) and still pass the character of this sound. This character lies in the manifold usefulness of the sound. You could extend it up or down until it covered all twelve tones. In this sense it is unlimited, infinite and basically atonal...\" On this sound surface, the characteristic trumpet fans are literally staged and counterpointed by a fatefully unfurling horn motif. This motif quotes the expressive beginning of the sentence through the use of the wide-stretched void. The sounds ebb and flow into a mourning chorale by the horns and the Wagner tubas, which Auer and Göllerich, named after Bruckner's \"farewell to life\". Ernst Décsey also highlights this mourning passage, stating: \"Bruckner called this passage [rehearsal mark B] when he played it to the two Helms, returning in 1894 from Berlin.\"\n\nNear the end of the first theme group, a slowly descending chorale appears. This chorale is cited by Anton Bruckner as the \"Farewell to Life\". Played by the Wagner tubas, it is in B minor (a tritone above the movement's overall tonic of E):\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\n\nThe beginning of the second theme group presents a somewhat more melodic, lamenting theme on the violins:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nIts second theme, a soft vocal melody, the structure of which is sometimes \"compared to the themes of the late Beethoven\", undergoes numerous modifications and variations as it progresses. Immediately before the reentry of the main theme, the solo flute descends in a C major triverse above the pale sound primer of an altered-fifth F major seventh chord from the Wagner tubas, to remain on the sound F after a final tritone fall.\n\nAfter a silence, the second part of the Adagio (from bar 77) follows. This is largely based on the components of the main theme. The existing material presented is varied and further developed. The principle of tone splitting is also evident here, above all in the opposite voice of the flute, which as a new element forms a clear counterpoint to the main theme. Only now does the actual implementation work begin, in which the lead motif of the first theme is carried up by proudly walking basses. Afterwards, the milder tone of the varied lyrical theme dominates again. After a brooding intermediate phase, a renewed increasing wave rises, which leads to the climax of the implementation. Once again, trumpets are blaring their already familiar fanfare, which abruptly stop. This is followed by the middle part of the vocal theme, which also ends abruptly. Only the very last end of the phrase is taken up by the oboe and declared in the forte, stemming from the horn in the diminutive form and in the piano. After a general break, the movement quickly pushes open. The crescendo, which has been stretched over a long period, breaks off abruptly, followed by an almost shy-sounding pianissimo part from the woodwinds, which in turn leads to a chorale-like episode of strings and brass. In the opinion of Constantin Floros, there are two passages in the Adagio, each appearing only once and not to \"recur in the further course of the composition. This applies once to the tuba [departure from life] at [rehearsal mark] B. [...] This applies to the other for the chorale-like episode, bars 155–162\". This spherically-transfigured passage has its origin set structurally in the tubal chorale, decreasing with the chorale into the finale.\n\nThe third part of the slow movement (from bar 173) begins with a figuratively animated reproduction of the second theme. Floros emphasizes that the Adagio of the Ninth, as well as the finale, \"must be viewed against an autobiographical background.\" Bruckner composed his Ninth Symphony in the awareness of his approaching death. Accordingly, the existing self-citations such as the \"Miserere\" from the D minor Mass (bar 181 onward) can also be understood in the sense of a religious connotation. In the third part, the two main themes are stacked atop each other and finally merge; all this takes place in the context of an enormous increase in sound. Bruckner creates a climax, \"as if he sought their monumental, expressive power and intensity unparalleled in music history\". The enormous accumulation of sound experiences a sharply dissonant discharge in the form of a figuratively extended thirteenth chord in bar 206. Then Bruckner, taking parts of the first theme and the Miserere, weaves a reconciling swan song. Finally, the Adagio of the Ninth ends, fading away; Kurth speaks of this as a \"process of dissolution.\": At an organ point on E, the Wagner tubas announce the secondary motif from the Adagio of the Eighth Symphony as the horns recall the beginning of the Seventh.\n\nBruckner called this movement his \"Farewell to Life\". It begins in tonal ambiguity, and is the most troubled opening to any Bruckner Adagio, although it achieves lyrical serenity and awe. The main theme is a portent for the chromaticism of the movement, starting with an upward leap of a minor ninth and containing all 12 tones of the chromatic scale:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nThroughout its course, the movement goes back to some of the troubled moods of the earlier movements. A call by the oboe – a quote of the \"Kyrie\" of Mass No. 3 – introduces the repeat of the first theme, which is underlined by dramatic trombone appeals. Shortly after, Bruckner also quotes, as a kind of supplication, the \"Miserere nobis\" from the Gloria of his Mass in D minor. The following final climax, given by the full orchestra, concludes on an extremely dissonant chord, a dominant thirteenth:\n\\relative c\"\" «\n</score>\n\nThereafter, in the most serene coda yet, the music alludes to the coda of the Adagio of Symphony No. 8, and also hints at Symphony No. 7. These bars of music conclude most live performances and recordings of the symphony, although Bruckner had intended for them to be succeeded by a fourth movement.\n\nAlthough Bruckner is supposed to have suggested using his \"Te Deum\" as the finale of the Ninth Symphony, there have been several attempts to complete the symphony with a fourth movement based on Bruckner's surviving manuscripts for the Finale. Indeed, Bruckner's suggestion has been used as a justification for completing the fourth movement, since, in addition to the existence of the fragments of the Finale, it shows (according to scholars such as John A. Phillips), that the composer did not want this work to end with the Adagio.\n\nThe materials of this 4th movement have preserved various stages of the composition: from simple profile sketches to more or less completely prepared score sheets, the so-called \"bifolio\". A bifolio (German: \"Bogen\") consists of a double paper sheet (four pages). Sometimes, there are multiple bifolios, which document Bruckner's different compositional concepts. The largest part of Bruckner's manuscripts of the final movement can be found in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Other works are located in the Vienna Library, in the library of the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, in the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna and in the Jagiellonska Library, Kraków.\n\nBruckner's estate administrator Theodor Reisch and the testament witnesses, Ferdinand Löwe and Joseph Schalk, according to the minutes of 18 October 1896 divided the estate; Joseph Schalk was commissioned to investigate the connection between the Finale Fragments. After his death (1900), the material in his possession came into the possession of his brother Franz; Ferdinand Löwe received further material. In 1911, Max Auer examined the surviving material of the final movement, which had been in the possession of Bruckner's former student Joseph Schalk. Referring to a sketch sheet, which is no longer available today, Auer states, \"The sketches... reveal a main theme, a fugue theme, a chorale and the fifth theme of the \"Te Deum\"\". In addition, Auer writes: \"Once these themes even towered over one another as in the finale of the Eighth.\" However, it is not possible to clearly identify which passage of the finale is actually meant.\n\nWhile Bruckner's score designs and sketches can be arranged harmoniously, so that a logical musical sequence results, there are five gaps in this musical composition. For instance, the conclusion of the symphony, the so-called Coda, is missing. The original material was more extensive, but some sheets of music were lost upon Bruckner's death. Bruckner's first biographer and secretary, August Göllerich (1859–1923), who was also the secretary of Franz Liszt, began a comprehensive Bruckner biography, which was completed after his death by the Bruckner researcher Max Auer (1880–1962). In this nine-volume work, it is reported that, \"It was an unforgivable mistake that an inventory of the estate was not included and an exact list can not be determined. After Dr. Heller's [Bruckner's attending physician] report the sheet music of the Master were laying around and parts of it were taken by qualified and unbidden people. It was even therefore not possible to find the chorale, which the Master had specially composed for Dr. Heller\".\n\nThe Australian musicologist John A. Phillips researched the different remaining fragments, compiling a selection of the fragments for the Musikwissenschaftlichen Verlag Wien. In his opinion, the material he obtained is of Bruckner's carefully numbered \"autograph score in the making\". According to his research, in May 1896, the composition, in the primary stage of the score (strings added, sketches for wind instruments too) was written. In his opinion, half of the final bifolios have been lost to the score today. The course of the gaps, however, can be largely restored from little changed earlier versions of individual sheets and extensive Particell sketches. The surviving remains of the score break off shortly before the coda with the 32nd bifolio. According to Phillips, the sketches contain the progress of the coda to the last cadence. The corresponding sketch for the 36th bifolio still contains the first eight bars with a lying tone of D.\n\nA facsimile edition of Bruckner's surviving final material has been published by Musikwissenschaftliche Verlag Wien. The largest part of the fragments can now also be viewed in the works database \"Bruckner online\".\n\nIn 1934, for the first time, Bruckner's passed down drafts and sketches of the Ninth Symphony were sequenced by the Bruckner researcher Alfred Orel (1889–1967). He assumed, however, that there are still different versions.\n\nThe movement, as left by Bruckner, features a \"jagged\" main theme with a double-dotted rhythm:\n</score>\nThis insistent double-dotted rhythm pervades the movement. The second theme group begins with a variant of the main theme. The third theme group features a grand chorale, presented by the full brass. This chorale, a \"resplendent resurrection\" of the \"Farewell to Life\" of the Adagio, descends in its first half with a similar mood as the Farewell to Life. But in the second half, the chorale ascends triumphantly:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nThe opening motif of the \"Te Deum\" appears before the development begins, played by the flute. The development that follows is brief, but contains a bizarre passage with minor-ninth trumpet calls:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nA \"wild fugue\" begins the recapitulation, using a variant of the main theme as a subject:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nAfter the recapitulation of the chorale, a new \"epilogue theme\" is introduced. Harnoncourt suggested that it probably would have led to the coda. After this cuts off, the only remaining extant music in Bruckner's hand is the previously mentioned initial crescendo and approach to the final cadence.\n\nIn 1934, parts of the final composition fragments in the piano version were edited by Else Krüger and performed by her and Kurt Bohnen, in Munich.\n\nIn 1940, Fritz Oeser created an orchestral installation for the Finale's exposition. This was performed on 12 October 1940 at the Leipzig Bruckner Festival in a concert of the Great Orchestra of the Reichssenders Leipzig with the conductor Hans Weisbach and transmitted by the radio.\n\nIn 1974, Conductor Hans-Hubert Schönzeler played major parts of the Finale for BBC with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn his essay, \"Approaching a Torso\" in 1976, the composer Peter Ruzicka published his research findings regarding the unfinished final movement of the Ninth Symphony. Previously, he recorded parts of the finale with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra.\n\nConductor Peter Hirsch has recorded a selection of the fragments with the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin on CD.\n\nNikolaus Harnoncourt performed the final score in a Phillips edition of the Phillips edition with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in Vienna (1999) and in Salzburg (2002).\n\nMany (alleged) utterances by Bruckner concerning his Ninth Symphony have only survived indirectly. Bruckner, fearing that he would not be able to complete his composition, was supposed to have envisioned his \"Te Deum\" as the possible end of the symphony. When the conductor Hans Richter (1843–1916) visited Bruckner, he told him (translated from German):\n\nAuer continued, about a possible transition to the \"Te Deum\", in the biography (translated from German):\n\nAugust Göllerich, Anton Meissner, August Stradal and Theodor Altwirth, persons who knew Bruckner personally and were familiar with him, reported in unison that Bruckner was no longer able to complete an instrumental finale: \"Realizing that the completion of a purely instrumental final movement was impossible, he [Bruckner] attempted to establish an organic connection to the \"Te Deum\", as proposed to him, to produce an emergency closure of the work, contrary to the tonal misgivings.\" Bruckner, therefore, certainly had tonal misgivings about ending the D minor symphony in C major. Nevertheless, he conceded to the variant with the \"Te Deum\" as a final replacement, at least according to the testimony of various eyewitnesses.\n\nAugust Göllerich, as his biographer, knew Bruckner personally and collected much information about Bruckner and his environment. The later biographers, who no longer knew Bruckner personally, drew on Göllerich's work. The authentic contemporary statements are therefore sometimes considered more accurate than the explanations and assumptions of later generations. If one wants to believe in contemporary biography, Bruckner had improvised the end of the symphony at the piano, but he was no longer able to fix the coda in definitive form and completely in writing.\n\nWe know by Anton Bruckner's physician, Richard Heller, the following words:\n\nIn the extended report of the physician, which Max Auer reproduces in his article, \"Anton Bruckner's last physician in charge\", in 1924, Heller stated, \"Since he was quite weak at that time, I often asked him to write the symphony in the main thoughts, but he was not willing to.\"\n\nFurthermore, Max Auer explains in his book, \"It is true that Bruckner led the pen until the last day of his life to finish his Ninth with a finale. The extensive sketches show that the master also wanted to conclude this work, like the Fifth Symphony, with a purely instrumental finale and a powerful fugue. In the middle of his work on the fugue, death snatched the pen from him\". Indeed, in the fugue, the last almost completely orchestrated score pages are traceable. The subsequent score pages are only incompletely instrumented, although the strings are written down in detail, but the winds are only incomplete or only hinted at.\n\nThe first attempt of a performing version of the Finale available on disc was the one by William Carragan (who has done arguably more important work editing Bruckner's Second Symphony). His 1983 completion was premiered by Moshe Atzmon, conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in January 1985.\n\nThe European premiere by the Utrecht Symfonie Orkest conducted by Hubert Soudant (Utrecht, April 1985), was the first to be recorded (on LP). Shortly afterwards, this version was recorded for CD release by Yoav Talmi and the Oslo Philharmonic.\n\nTalmi's recording also includes the retrieved fragments Bruckner left so that the listener may determine for himself how much of the realization is speculation by the editor.The revision of 2006 was recorded by . This recording includes the Trio No. 2 of 1893 (Ed. Carragan, 2006).The further revision of 2010, which was premiered by Warren Cohen and the Musica Nova Orchestra in November 2009, has been recorded by Gerd Schaller and the Philharmonie Festiva.Carragan made some additional adjustments in 2017.\n\nCarragan uses both older and earlier bifolios. He bridges the gaps more freely by using sound formations and harmonic connections that are less typical for Bruckner than for later musical history (Mahler). He extends the coda by remaining at a constant fortissimo level for long periods and incorporating a variety of themes and allusions, including the chorale theme and the \"Te Deum\".\nThe team of Nicola Samale and Giuseppe Mazzuca put together a new realization from 1983 to 1985, which was recorded in 1986 by Eliahu Inbal and fits in with Inbal's recordings of early versions of Bruckner's symphonies. It was also included by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky in his recording of the different versions of Bruckner's symphonies. The coda of the Samale and Mazzuca realization has more in common with the corresponding passage of the Eighth Symphony than it does with the later Samale, Mazzuca, Phillips and Cohrs realization. The authors, Samale and Mazzuca, do not wish this version to be performed any longer.\n\nFor this venture Samale and Mazzuca were joined by John A. Phillips and Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs. This completion proposes one way to realize Bruckner's intention to combine themes from all four movements. This completion has been recorded by Kurt Eichhorn, with the Bruckner Orchestra in Linz, for the Camerata label. The 1996 revision has been recorded by Johannes Wildner for Naxos.\n\nA new, revised edition of this completion was published in 2005 by Nicola Samale and Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs. Cohrs' latest research also made it possible to recover the musical content of one missing bifolio in the Fugue fully from the particello-sketch. This new edition, 665 bars long, makes use of 569 bars from Bruckner himself. This version has been recorded by Marcus Bosch for the label Coviello Classics.\n\nA revised reprint of this first revision was performed by the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Daniel Harding, Stockholm, in November 2007. This revision was published in 2008 and was then recorded by conductor Friedemann Layer with the Musikalische Akademie des Nationaltheater-Orchesters, Mannheim. Richard Lehnert explains the changes made for this version.\n\nA final revision was made in 2011, in particular including an entirely new conception of the Coda.\nThe world premiere of this new ending was given by the Dutch Brabants Orkest under the baton of Friedemann Layer in Breda (NL), 15 October 2011. It was performed in Berlin on 9 February 2012 by Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic and can be watched on the Internet. This version was released on EMI Classics on 22 May 2012. Rattle conducted the American premiere at Carnegie Hall on 24 February 2012. Simon Rattle conducted this version again with the Berlin Philharmonic on 26 May 2018.\n\nNicola Samale and Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs compare in their preface to the study score of the completed performance version of Samale-Phillips-Cohrs-Mazzuca (2008) the reconstruction of a musical work with methods of reconstruction of plastic surgery, forensic pathology, aetiology and fine art:\n\nFor the beginning of the final movement, the SMPC team of authors uses a bifolio in Bruckner's form in a shortened form. To fill in the gaps, the authors rely primarily on later bifolios and sketches of Bruckner, while earlier original material is sometimes disregarded. The authors believe that every gap has a certain number of bars. The gaps are added by the four editors according to the calculations they have made. For the coda, the authors use Bruckner's sequencing sketches, which are also processed by other authors, in a transposed form. The block effect of the final part is achieved mainly by the constant repetition of individual motifs. The authors also include various themes of the finale.\n\nThe coda combines the main themes of all four movements simultaneously, in a somewhat similar fashion to the coda of the finale of Symphony No. 8:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nIn his finale edition, Nors S. Josephson makes various cyclical connections to the first and third movement of the symphony. Above all, he refers to a method that Bruckner uses in his Symphony No. 8. Josephson also uses Bruckner's sketched sequencing, which is believed to be part of the coda. In the coda. He refers to the themes of the exposition and avoids further development of the material. Compared to the Adagio, the final movement gets less weight in his edition. Josephson's completion by John Gibbons with the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra has been issued by Danacord: CD DADOCD 754, 2014.\n\nNors S. Josephson also aims for a reconstruction and states in the preface to his score edition, which is titled as Finale-Reconstruction:\n\nIn 2008 the Belgian organist and composer Sébastien Letocart realized a new completion of the Finale in 2007–08. In the \"Coda\" he included quotations of themes from the Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Symphonies, the mid-subject of the \"Trio\" as a final \"Halleluja\", and at the end the combination of the four main themes from all four movements of the Ninth.\n\nLetocart's completion, together with the first three parts of the symphony, was recorded in 2008 by the French conductor Nicolas Couton with the MAV Symphony Orchestra of Budapest. \nSébastien Letocart states in the booklet text to the CD recording of his final version:\nGerd Schaller has composed his own completion of the Ninth, closely based on Bruckner's notes. He took into account all available draft materials as far back as the earliest sketches in order to close the remaining gaps in the score as much as possible. He used Bruckner's original manuscript documents, and ran the finale to 736 bars. Additionally, Schaller was able to supplement archival and manuscript material with missing elements in the score by drawing on his experience as a conductor, and applying Bruckner's compositional techniques to the recordings of the complete cycle of all the composer's eleven symphonies. The resulting composition, even the passages without continuous original material, are in a recognizably Brucknerian style. \nSchaller also creates the broad, dramatically designed reprise of the main theme from Bruckner's earlier sketches. In the coda he quotes the opening theme of the first movement, thereby bridging the beginning of the symphony, a technique of quoting that Bruckner himself used in his symphonies (Symphony No. 3 and Symphony No. 5) and originating back to Beethoven. In the final part of the coda, Schaller renounces the quotations from other works by Bruckner in his newly published revised edition of 2018.\n\nSchaller first performed his version of the finale with the Philharmonie Festiva in the abbey church at Ebrach on 24 July 2016, as part of the Ebrach Summer Music Festival. \nIn March 2018 Schaller's revised version was published by Ries and Erler, Berlin, Score No 51487, ISMN M-013-51487-8. Schaller performed his revised version of the finale in the abbey church at Ebrach on 22 July 2018. This performance is issued on Profil CD PH18030.\nGerd Schaller explains a reconstruction in itself as an impossible undertaking:\nOther completions have been made by Ernst Märzendorfer (1969), Hein 's-Gravesande (1969), Marshall Fine (1979), and Roberto Ferrazza (2017).\n\nUnlike most of his symphonies, Bruckner did not produce multiple revisions of his Ninth Symphony. However, there have been multiple editions of what Bruckner did write, as well as several attempts to complete the symphony's fourth movement, which Bruckner left unfinished.\n\nThis was the first published edition of the Ninth Symphony. It was also the version performed at the work's posthumous premiere, and the only version heard until 1932. Ferdinand Löwe made multiple unauthorized changes to the Symphony amounting to a wholesale re-composition of the work. In addition to second-guessing Bruckner's orchestration, phrasing and dynamics, Löwe also dialed back Bruckner's more adventurous harmonies, such as the complete dominant thirteenth chord in the Adagio.\n\nThis was the first edition to attempt to reproduce what Bruckner had actually written. It was first performed in 1932 by the Munich Philharmonic conducted by Siegmund von Hausegger, in the same program immediately following a performance of Löwe's edition. The edition was published, possibly with adjustments, two years later (1934) under the auspices of the \"Gesamtausgabe\".\n\nThis is a corrected reprint of the Orel edition of 1934. The Nowak edition is the most commonly performed one today.\n\nThis new edition of the complete three movements has been recorded by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Simon Rattle and Simone Young. It contains only minor differences from the Orel and Nowak editions, but corrects several printing errors and includes extensive comments in the footnotes, explaining some of the editorial problems. The separate Critical Report of Cohrs contains numerous facsimiles from the first three movements. It also contains an edition of the two earlier Trios for concert performance.\n\n\nRecordings of the completions of the fourth movement are usually coupled with the Nowak or Cohrs edition for the first three movements.\n\nA recording of the Orel or Nowak edition on average lasts about 65 minutes, though a fast conductor like Carl Schuricht can get it down to 56 minutes.\n\nThe oldest complete performance (of the three completed movements) preserved on record is by Otto Klemperer with the New York Philharmonic from 1934.\n\nThe first commercial recording was made by Siegmund von Hausegger with the Munich Philharmonic in 1938 for HMV. Both recordings used the Orel edition.\n\nThe apocryphal Löwe version is available on CD remasterings of LPs by Hans Knappertsbusch and F. Charles Adler. These can be as short as 51 minutes.\n\nThe earliest recordings of the Orel edition were Oswald Kabasta's live performance with the Munich Philharmonic in 1943 for the Music and Arts label, and Wilhelm Furtwängler's studio performance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1944 (multiple labels).\n\nAfter Bruno Walter's studio recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in 1959 for Sony/CBS, the Nowak edition was preferred.\n\nThe most recent Orel edition recording was Daniel Barenboim's live performance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1991 for Teldec.\n\nIn 2003 Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Wiener Philharmoniker recorded the Ninth (Cohrs edition) as well as the Finale fragment for BMG/RCA, but without the coda sketches.\n\nIn the CD \"Bruckner unknown\" (PR 91250, 2013) Ricardo Luna recorded the Scherzo, the three versions of the Trio (own edition) as well as the Finale fragment with the coda sketches.\n\n\n\n"}

He felt it could provide a guide for the country during its tumultuous period following the May Fourth Movement in 1919. He felt that national survival was predicated on a sense of community, which in turn could only come from trusting commitments from the people involved. He believed that the most urgent task for the educated elite in China was to raise the cultural awareness and sensitivity of the people that the clash between the West and China was not solely a clash of economic strength and military might, but also a conflict between basic human values. While he led a fairly secluded life throughout his career as a teacher and his association with the academic community did not begin until he was in his late thirties, his views have influenced scholars to this day.\n\nXiong was born to a poverty-stricken family in the Huanggang, Hubei. His father was a village teacher who died of tuberculosis when Xiong was ten years old, forcing him to work as a cowherd for his neighbor to support his family. By his twenties, he was a dedicated revolutionary in the Republican Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and ushered in China's first republic. Disgusted over corruption in politics, and what he termed \"latent feudalism\" among the revolutionaries, he began to study Buddhism in 1920 at the China Institute for Inner Learning () in Nanjing headed by Ouyang Jingwu (), perhaps the most influential lay Buddhist thinker of the twentieth century. At this time, the Chancellor of Peking University, Cai Yuanpei, sent Liang Shuming to Nanjing to ask Ouyang Jingwu to recommend one of his students to teach Buddhist Logic (因明學, \"Yinming Xue\") and Yogacara philosophy () in the Philosophy Department at Peking University. Ouyang Jingwu recommended Xiong and passed Liang Shuming a draft on which Xiong had been working entitled \"An Outline of Consciousness-only\". Impressed with Xiong's work, Cai Yuanpei, on Liang's recommendation, invited Xiong to Peking University where Xiong, much to the chagrin of Liang Shuming, destroyed his draft and instead wrote and published in 1932 what is now considered his major work \"A New Treatise on Consciousness-only\" (新唯识论, xin weishi lun). In his \"New Treatise\", Xiong criticized the old Yogacara masters, such as the brothers Vasubandhu and Asanga (4 c.), as well as their successors, Dharmapala (530-561) and Xuanzang (c. 602–664), for their theory of seeds in which seeds, stored in the eight or 'storehouse' consciousness (alayavijnana), become discrete causal agents that 'perfume' (bring into being) all mental and physical dharmas. However, he also used the insights of Buddhism to reconstruct Confucianism. Much of his philosophy is influenced both by Buddhism and by his study of the Book of Changes, which he regarded as the fundamental classic of Confucianism.\n\nXiong felt that his mission was to assist China in overcoming its social and cultural crisis, and simultaneously to search for truth. He felt compelled to find and develop the \"dao\" of Confucius to meet the force of Western culture. In his outline of the main point of the \"New Treatise\" he wrote (in reply to Mou Zongsan):\n\nNow again we are in a weak and dangerous situation. With the strong aggression of European culture, our authentic spirit has been extinct. People are accustomed to self-disregard, self-violence, self-abandonment. Everything is copied from the outside, with little self-establishment. Hence the \"New Treatise\" must be written.\n\nThe first edition of the \"New Treatise\" was written in Classical Chinese, and in 1944 Xiong published a Colloquial Chinese version which was in actuality a complete rewriting of the original work. In 1958–59 Xiong published \"On Original Reality and Function\" and \"Illuminating the Mind\". Together, these two books form a revised account of his \"New Treatise\".\n\nAfter the founding of the People’s Republic of China, Xiong stayed on the mainland and continued to lecture at Peking University. While he wasn’t required to criticize his earlier thinking in terms of Marxism, and he even received government funding in publishing some of his writings after 1949, he was still subjected to physical abuse at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. After seeing Confucianism suffer another cultural and political blow, he died at the age of 84 in 1968.\n\nXiong's preference of Confucianism is partially because he felt that Buddhism over-emphasizes the negative or passive aspects of human nature. Because of this, it fails to provide a positive and active guide to human life. This is something that Confucianism provided with its trend towards humanist thought. He labels Buddhism a learning of ‘daily decrease,’ a philosophy that points out the darker aspects of human nature and then directs us to eliminate it. Xiong’s view of humanity was brighter. He felt that the meaning of human life is not confined to the elimination of the negative, but also involves the cultivation of the brighter aspects of human nature. He found Confucianism to uphold original human goodness; an original benevolence is insisted upon in Orthodox Confucianism. The role of the human dao is to develop this fundamental goodness. Xiong felt that the human dao lies in expanding the good root of the original mind and having it grow daily.\n\nXiong felt that the central theory of his \"New Treatise\" was to show that original reality, (what he also refers to as \"ti\" 體 and substance), and the material world, (which he calls \"yong\" 用, or function. Cf. Ti yong) are one. The two cannot be split into separate realms. He admits that they should be described using different terms, and can be spoken of as such, but are not actually two separate entitites. Original reality is the cause of all transformations, while function is the myriad of manifestations of original reality. Original reality is hidden, function is visible. He uses the metaphor of the ocean and the waves to illustrate this point.\n\nThis is different from the notion of substance in mainstream western philosophy, which does not allow substance to embrace dynamism. Plato’s Forms, for example, are static and normative. Xiong's substance changes and transforms unceasingly to become function.\n\n\"This meaning is subtle and profound. It is best illustrated in terms of the relationship between the ocean and all the waves. 1. The ocean is analogous to original reality; 2. All the water in the ocean is manifested as waves. This is analogous to original reality's manifestation as function of ten thousand things, that is, one function and another. 3. All the waves are analogous to the innumerable functions; 4. All the waves are mutually assimilable to a whole; this is analogous to the mutual assimilation of all the functions into a whole. From the above, we can see that the metaphor of the ocean and the waves best illuminates the relation between original reality and function.\"\n\nThe idea that reality and function are in fact, one unit, is a metaphysical claim that is key to Confucianism. This means that the phenomenal flux of change is not illusory, but is intrinsically meaningful. Thus, if original reality is in daily life, human lives should be devoted to daily cultivation in order to attain the vision of original reality.\n\nXiong believed that the world is in a state of constant change, and that the ability of changing into all things is exactly what characterizes original reality. He also refers to original reality as \"eternal transformation\" or \"the ability to change\". Furthermore, he suggested that the perpetual transformation of original reality consists of \"opening\" and \"closing\", two tendencies of change. Closing refers to the tendency of transformation that forms things; through integration and consolidation, or materialization, various physical things are formed. Simultaneously, there is a tendency of opening. This tendency is of being strong, vigorous and not materialized. Both tendencies are indispensable, and they are responsible for the apparent distinction between matter and mind, a distinction that Xiong held is not real.\n\nBetween the two, however, Xiong refers to the opening tendency as \"mind\" and consciousness—the tendency in which original reality manifests its true nature. Like the Buddhist theory of Mere Consciousness, Xiong's philosophy claims consciousness as the ultimate reality. Along these lines, he considered the universe to be living and vital, not a stagnant mechanism.\n\nTu Wei-Ming's essay on Xiong Shili’s quest for authentic existence, includes a quote that exemplifies where Xiong's philosophy was coming from on a personal level. He was driven by \"a great wish to search for truth as a ground for 'peace of mind and a meaningful existence ...' I searched within myself with a singleness of purpose. I thought that the truth is not remote from us ... After a long time, I suddenly awoke to the realization that what I inwardly witnessed agreed entirely with the idea of 'great change' in the Confucian transmission ... hence my own understanding of Confucianism was not derived from book learning. Only after my inner experience had already embodied it did I feel that my understanding of it was in complete harmony with what was recorded in the books.\"\n\nThe first sentences of the \"New Doctrine\" state that \"the original reality of all things is neither the objective world separate from the mind, nor that is comprehensible through knowledge; it must be comprehended through reflective seeking and confirming\".\n\nThis has two important implications, one, that the human mind and original reality are not separate; and two, original reality must be grasped through reflection on what is in the human mind. Because original reality and the human mind are not separate, this means that in order to know reality, you must first get to know your own mind. This is the cultivation of virtue.\n\nFor Xiong Shili, the human mind is distinguished by the habituated mind and the original mind. The habituated mind is the mind of thought, emotions, and the will. It is inclined to see the world as external to the self and is motivated by self-desires. Additionally, it uses \"calculative understanding\", which is a method of thinking that is deliberative and logical, bound to scientific rationality and sense experience. In contrast, the original mind is our real nature, at one with reality. It uses \"nature understanding\", which is an inward process of intuitive experiencing that points back to the mind itself to discover the original reality within it. Xiong speaks of calculative understanding as fit for seeking reason in the external world, the physical world. He states that we must use it carefully, and if we take original reality as an external object to infer and inquire into, then it is fundamentally wrong. He says that original reality can be comprehended, differing from Kant on this point. He stated that we must realize that original reality is in each one of us, and that we cannot seek to know it in external things. We must turn inward and allow original reality to present itself.\n\n\n"}

He married with a Kanhaiya girl and lastly he had his biological child. His first heir was his adopted son. He, his father and his grandfather linked with Kanhaiyas.\n\nHe was the son of Maharani Chand Kaur and Maharaja Kharak Singh, himself the eldest son and heir of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Sher-e-Panjab and a grandson of Maharani Datar Kaur of the Nakai Misl.\n\nIn April 1837 at the age of sixteen he was married to Bibi Sahib Kaur, a daughter of Shaheed Sardar Sham Singh Attariwala (1790–1846) of the village of Attari in Amritsar district of Punjab.\n\nNau Nihal was raised outside the court politics at Lahore however at the age of eighteen, and forced by his father's incapacity he returned to Lahore. He was instructed to govern in the name of his father under the direction of the vizier, Dhian Singh. When Kharak Singh became gravely ill, the court physician Johann Martin Honigberger noted that despite his father begging him to see him every day, Nau Nihal rarely visited his father.\n\nNau Nihal was popular with the royal courtiers and the general public, and was seen as a worthy successor to his father during the latter's sickness. After Kharak Singh died on 5 November 1840, Nau Nihal performed his last rites beside the Ravi River in Lahore. After the ceremony, he started returning to the palace via the Hazuri Bagh, where a massive block of stone from a gate fell upon him and two of his companions. One of the companions - who was a nephew of the prime minister Dhian Singh - died instantly.\n\nAccording to Alexander Gardner, who was just steps behind Nau Nihal when the incident took place, the prince had sustained only minor injuries during this episode: he was well enough to walk on his own, and agreed to be taken on a stretcher only because of Gardner's insistence. However, when the court physician Johann Martin Honigberger came to attend Nau Nihal in a tent, he observed that the prince's skull had been crushed, and the bedsheet was covered with blood and brain tissue. Dhian Singh insisted that the prince had suffered these injuries during the alleged accident in Hazuri Bagh. Nau Nihal died hours later, although the courtiers did not make this news public until three days later in an attempt to avoid panic. According to Gardner, five artillery men had carried Nau Nihal from Hazuri Bagh to the tent: two of these men died under mysterious circumstances, two went on leave and never re-joined the service, and one disappeared without explanation.\n\nNau Nihal was cremated on 9 November 1840, and two of his teenage wives died on his funeral pyre as per the sati custom. His eldest wife, who was pregnant, was spared from sati. Another 12-year old wife was spared from sati because of her young age, after the intervention of Nau Nihal's uncle Sher Singh.\n\nAfter Nau Nihal's death, a court faction proclaimed his uncle Sher Singh as the rightful heir, while another declared his mother Chand Kaur as the ruler. The faction supporting Chand Kaur hoped that Nau Nihal's pregnant wife would give birth to a son. However, the widow gave birth to a stillborn baby six months later, and Sher Singh besieged Lahore with a 70,000-strong army. Ultimately, Chand Kaur agreed to acknowledge Sher Singh's claim to the throne in return for a generous settlement and safe passage, and Sher Singh was crowned on 18 January 1841. A few months later, on 11 June 1842, Chand Kaur's maids killed her by crushing her skull, just like her son had died. While being punished by Prime Minister Dhian Singh, they insisted that they had killed Chand Kaur on Sher Singh's orders.\n\nNau Nihal Singh had ordered the construction of a bunga (tower) in the complex of Tarn Taran Sahib, one of the Holiest Sikh Shrines in the Majha Region of Punjab Kingdom.\n"}

He appeared twice in the postseason, with the National League (NL) Champion Dodgers in 1974 and the American League (AL) West-winning White Sox in 1983.\n\nFollowing his retirement as an active player, he worked as a color commentator for various MLB clubs, most notably the White Sox where he was teamed with Ken Harrelson on telecasts throughout the 1990s. Paciorek is famously known by the nickname \"Wimpy\", which was given to him by Tom Lasorda after a dinner with minor league teammates in which he was the only one to order a hamburger instead of steak.\n\nAfter graduating from St. Ladislaus High School in Hamtramck, Michigan, Paciorek played baseball and football for the University of Houston from 1965 to 1968. A defensive back, he was picked by the Miami Dolphins in the ninth round of the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft. In baseball, he was named to the All-Tournament team after the Cougars reached the finals of the 1967 College World Series, and were the national runner-up to Arizona State. Paciorek's number was retired by the Cougars as one of only three in the history of the team.\n\nHe was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1968 MLB draft, one of 14 players drafted by the Dodgers that year to reach the majors. A top prospect, he was \"The Sporting News\"' Minor League Player of the Year in 1972 at Triple-A Albuquerque. He spent the 1973 through 1975 seasons as a fourth outfielder and pinch hitter. After hitting under .200 in 1975, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves as part of a trade for Dusty Baker. He hit .290 in a platoon role for Atlanta in 1976 but he struggled to duplicate those numbers the following year.\n\nThe Braves released him after spring training in 1978, but signed him again just a week later. However, after six weeks and only nine at bats (with three hits), the Braves gave him his release a second time in May. Paciorek signed with the Seattle Mariners, where he hit .299 over seventy games.\n\nFollowing two solid years as a platoon player, Paciorek put together a career season with the Mariners in the 1981 season. Playing full-time for the only time in his career at age 34, Paciorek batted .326, second in the American League, and was fourth in the AL in slugging percentage. He earned his only appearance to an All-Star team in 1981 and was tenth in the AL MVP race.\n\nAfter a request for increased compensation and a three-year contract, the Mariners traded Paciorek in December to the Chicago White Sox for three players, none of whom made an impact with Seattle. He hit over .300 his first two years with the Sox, and was part of Chicago's division championship team in 1983.\n\nWith the White Sox in 1984, he set an unusual MLB record. Paciorek replaced Ron Kittle in left field in the fourth inning of their game with the Milwaukee Brewers on May 8 – a game which went 25 innings, the longest game in major league history (as measured in time on the field). When it ended the following day, Paciorek had amassed five hits in nine at bats, a record for most hits in a game by a non-starting player which still stands. Several players have had four hits in a game as a substitute, most recently Quinton McCracken of the Arizona Diamondbacks in .\n\nHe was traded to the New York Mets in 1985, then spent his final two years with the Texas Rangers.\n\nTom was one of three brothers to play in the majors. His younger brother Jim played for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987, while older brother John played one game for the Houston Colt .45s (in which he went 3–3 and walked twice) in 1963.\n\nPaciorek has played 397 games at first base, 23 games at third base, 1 game at shortstop, 483 games in left field, 74 games in center field and 281 games in right field. His best position was at first base, recording a .994 fielding percentage.\n\nPaciorek has served as a broadcaster for several years since retiring as a player, with his most notable stint as the color commentator on White Sox television broadcasts alongside Ken Harrelson, who affectionately called him by his baseball nickname, \"Wimpy\", on-air. Paciorek broadcast for the White Sox from 1988 to 1999, then called selected games for the Detroit Tigers in 2000 and the Seattle Mariners in 2001 before calling the Atlanta Braves on FSN South from 2002 to 2005. In 2006, he was the color commentator for the Washington Nationals, but his contract was not renewed for 2007. He is fondly remembered amongst Nationals fans for his distinct pronunciation of \"Alfonso Soriano,\" a Nationals outfielder that season: \"\"Eelfahnso Soriaahno\"\".\n\nIn 1992, Tom Paciorek was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Paciorek told the \"Detroit Free Press\" in a report that priest Gerald Shirilla had molested him and three of his four brothers while working as a teacher at St. Ladislaus Catholic High School in Hamtramck in the 1960s. \"I was molested by him for a period of four years,\" Paciorek is reported to have said. \"I would refer to them as attacks. I would say there was at least a hundred of them.\" The former All-Star said he didn't tell anyone because no one would have believed him saying \"When you're a kid, and you're not able to articulate, who's going to believe you?\" and \"The church back then was so powerful, there's nothing that a kid could do.\"\n\nIn 2016 Paciorek was named to the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

It was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London, and is included on the group's 1969 debut album \"Led Zeppelin\".\n\n\"Black Mountain Side\" was inspired by a traditional Irish folk song called \"Down by Blackwaterside\". The guitar arrangement closely follows Bert Jansch's version of that song, recorded for his 1966 album \"Jack Orion\". Al Stewart, who followed Jansch's gigs, taught it to Page, who was a session musician for Stewart's debut album.\n\nPage played the instrumental on a borrowed Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar which was tuned to D–A–D–G–A–D, which he had used for \"White Summer\". To enhance the Indian character of the song, drummer and sitarist Viram Jasani played tabla on the track.\n\nThe overall Eastern-flavour of the structure was to lead writer William S. Burroughs into a suggestion to Jimmy Page about Led Zeppelin's music:\n\nWhen the song was played at Led Zeppelin concerts it usually featured as part of Jimmy Page's instrumental \"White Summer\", with the combined arrangement \"White Summer-Black Mountain Side\" typically running at 11 minutes. Page would sit on a stool for the duration of the two songs and usually played them on a 1959 Danelectro DC \"Double Cutaway\" guitar, tuned differently from his favored Gibson Les Paul. These songs were used by the band to showcase Page's skills as a guitarist, because he played them almost entirely by himself, with drummer John Bonham adding some fills later in the song. The \"White Summer\"/\"Black Mountain Side\" combination was first performed as part of their first-ever concert at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, on 10 January 1969; the Spokane show from 30 December 1968 features the arrangement without \"Black Mountain Side\".\n\nThis song was a component of Led Zeppelin's live set list until their fifth US Tour in 1970. Years later it was restored to their set for the 1977 US Tour, the 1979 concerts and 1980 European tour. \"Black Mountain Side\" was also used to lead into \"Kashmir\" on this latter tour.\n\nA live version of this song can be seen on the \"Led Zeppelin\" DVD, during Led Zeppelin's 1970 Royal Albert Hall appearance. A similar version can be heard, most likely from the Playhouse Theatre sessions from 27 June 1969, on the expanded version of \"Coda\", an album of outtakes released in 1982. This arrangement has the \"White Summer\" segment being played for around eight minutes, and \"Black Mountain Side\" is heard somewhere in the middle.\n\nPage later played versions of this song when he was with the Firm, the group he founded with Paul Rodgers.\n\n"}

Growing tall, it is a deciduous vine. It is widely cultivated in temperate regions for its twisting stems and masses of scented flowers in hanging racemes, in spring.\n\n\"Wisteria sinensis\" clings to supporting plants or man-made structures by counterclockwise-twining stems. The leaves are shiny, green, pinnately compound, 10–30 cm in length, with 9-13 oblong leaflets that are each 2–6 cm long. The flowers are white, violet, or blue, produced on 15–20 cm racemes before the leaves emerge in spring. The flowers on each raceme open simultaneously before the foliage has expanded, and have a distinctive fragrance similar to that of grapes. Though it has shorter racemes than \"Wisteria floribunda\" (Japanese wisteria), it often has a higher quantity of racemes. The fruit is a flattened, brown, velvety, bean-like pod 5–10 cm long with thick disk-like seeds around 1 cm in diameter spaced evenly inside; they mature in summer and crack and twist open to release the seeds; the empty pods often persist until winter. However seed production is often low, and most regenerative growth occurs through layering and suckering.\n\nAll parts of the plant contain a glycoside called wisterin which is toxic if ingested and may cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea. Wisterias have caused poisoning in children of many countries, producing mild to severe gastroenteritis.\n\n\"Wisteria sinensis\" was unknown in the west before 1816, when several agents of the East India Company working in China sent cuttings back to England. Over the next several decades the plant became, and remains, one of the quintessential ornamental vines in temperate gardens worldwide. A 200-year-old specimen, growing at Griffin's Brewery in Chiswick, London, is often cited as the UK's oldest living wisteria plant. \n\nIt has become an invasive species in some areas of the eastern United States where the climate closely matches that of China.\n\n\"Wisteria sinensis\" is most commonly trained along garden walls, along the exterior of buildings, or over a pergola to create avenues of overhanging blossoms during bloom. It may also be trained as a freestanding tree.\n\nChinese wisteria is more sensitive to cold than American wisteria (\"Wisteria frutescens\") and Japanese wisteria (\"Wisteria floribunda\"). Although root hardy to USDA Zone 5 (-20 Fahrenheit), the vine can suffer serious dieback during such cold snaps. Moreover, the frequency of spring frosts in Zones 5 and 6 can kill latent flower buds, so that the plant might only bloom sporadically.\n\nA one-acre (4,000 m) specimen located in Sierra Madre, California is recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's largest blossoming plant.\n\nA white-flowering cultivar, \"Wisteria sinensis\" 'Alba', was discovered in a garden by botanist Robert Fortune in 1844, from which he took cuttings for the Royal Horticultural Society.\n\nIn addition to the white 'Alba', 'Prolific' features the classic purple flowers, but in greater abundance with larger racemes. It also blooms at an earlier age than the traditional cultivar. The variety 'Amethyst' has deeper colored reddish violet flowers that are extremely fragrant.\nThe cultivars ‘Prolific’, ‘Amethyst’ and ‘Jako’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit \n"}

To either side of the street rests the Public Prosecutors Office, Sejong Center, U.S. Embassy, Kyobo Life Insurance, Kyobo Book Centre and Donga Ilbo headquarters.\n\nIt was customary for the Korean Marines who are about to graduate their 2 years of service, to congregate in front of Lee's statue and swear allegiance. This was stopped due to creating immense traffic congestions to the 8 lane street of Sejongno.\n\nIn 2009, major sections underwent a renovation period of 15-months, which downsized the 600-meter road from 16-lane to 10-lanes of traffic. The project included sections of the road from the front of Gwanghwamun and strenches south from the three-way intersection, along the front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts to the Sejong-ro intersection, where the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin stands. The reduction was to construct the Gwanghwamun Plaza, a public open space in the center to the road.\n\nOn 29 November 2009, parts of road were closed to traffic for twelve hours to film lengthy gunfight scenes for Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s 2009 spy action television drama series \"Iris\", starring Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-hee, Jung Joon-ho, Kim Seung-woo and Kim So-yeon. The five lanes along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts were closed to traffic from 07:00 to 19:00, while the five lanes on the Kyobo Book Centre side remains open to traffic. This marks the first time the Seoul Metropolitan Government has granted permission to blocked traffic along the Plaza for filming and it is part of Government's plans to promote the city's major tourist attractions; including Cheonggye Stream and Han River.\n\nOn 23 September 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts to the Sejong-ro intersection.\n\n\nGwanghwamun Station, which is on Subway Line 5, is located at the southern end of Sejong-daero. Gyeongbokgung Station, which is served by Subway Line 3, has entrances near the northern end of Sejong-daero.\n\n"}

Versions were also made of metal, including castings with figurative designs, such as the Hurrian foundation pegs (Syria, c. 2300 – c. 2159 BCE).\n\nAdditionally, uninscribed clay cones painted in different colors were used by Sumerians to create decorative mosaic patterns on walls and pillars of buildings, which also offered some protection against weathering.\n\nThe similar funerary cones of ancient Egypt used the cone base as the major writing surface.\n\nAs some of the oldest 'documents' in history, the sponsor, responsible for the construction, or dedication of a work, some of the oldest histories, and/or intrigues are recorded. (Boasting sometimes led to historical inaccuracies, or misstatements of facts.)\n\nKing Entemena's nail is a prime example of a clay nail in excellent condition, as well as a detailed story. He was king of Lagash towards the late-middle of the 3rd millennium BC.\n\nOne of King Hammurabi's clay nails was acquired in March 1938 from an antique dealer. The nail, although fully preserved, is missing almost the entire shaft. The head has a diameter of 187 millimeters. In comparison, the shaft at the base is 110 millimeters in diameter. Both the head and shaft are inscribed with cuneiform writing in Akkadian. There are three columns of text on the head of the nail; the first column on the upper half having dulled over the course of centuries, and the lower half of the third column broken off. The clay nail bears the number A 24645 at the Oriental Institute, the University of Chicago's archaeology museum.\n\nThere are two replicas of the clay nail with the same inscription located at the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Oxford Museum. However, each were transliterated and translated differently. The Philadelphia version is filled with missing text, although the complication was solved with the help of the Chicago version. Simultaneously, the Oxford text gives the Sumerian version. All three clay nails are now preserved in each of their respected locations. They are easily recognized to be from the Hammurabi period due to their distinct style of having a mushroom shape, broad heads, and short shafts.\n\n"}

Earlier, he earned acclaim for his television work, especially as the long-suffering high school principal, Seymour Kaufman, on ABC's sitcom, \"Room 222,\" for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1970; he was again recognized by the Emmy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Awards, the following year. After the conclusion of \"Room 222\", Constantine portrayed night court magistrate Matthew J. Sirota on the 1976 sitcom \"Sirota's Court\", receiving his second Golden Globe nomination. Constantine reprised his role as Gus Portokalos in \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\" (2016).\n\nConstantine was born Gus Efstratiou in Reading, Pennsylvania, the son of Andromache Efstratiou (Ανδρομάχη Ευστρατίου; née Fotiadou [Φωτιάδου]) and Theoharis Ioannides [Θεοχάρης Ιωαννίδης] (a steel worker), both immigrants from Greece.\n\nHe began his career on the New York stage and in the mid-1950s as understudy to Paul Muni in \"Inherit the Wind\". While in the cast, he met and married actress Julianna McCarthy on October 5, 1953; they had two children, Thea Eileen and Brendan Neil. The marriage ended in divorce in 1969, the same year that Constantine began his role on \"Room 222\".\n\nHe studied acting with such prominent mentors as Howard Da Silva. He was playing character roles on and off Broadway in his mid-twenties, supplementing his income as a night watchman and shooting-gallery barker. In 1959, he appeared in his first film, \"The Last Mile\" (1959). He had a small but memorable supporting role in \"The Hustler\" (1961). In 1964 and 1965, Constantine appeared on \"Perry Mason\", both times as the murderer. He played the role of wannabe private eye Dillard in \"The Case of the Blonde Bonanza\", then he played Pappy Ryan in \"The Case of the Runaway Racer\". In 1967, he appeared in the first part of \"The Judgment\", the two-episode conclusion of \"The Fugitive\", starring David Janssen. Constantine played a long-suffering anti-organized-crime agent in Walt Disney's caper film \"The North Avenue Irregulars\" (1979), where he appeared alongside Edward Herrmann and Cloris Leachman. He also played an organized crime mobster who worked for Frank Nitti in the television version of \"The Untouchables\".\n\nHe played Santa Claus in \"Prancer\" (1989). In 1993, Constantine appeared in the independent drama \"Question of Faith\", starring Anne Archer and Sam Neill. He played Tadzu Lempke in Stephen King's \"Thinner\" (1996). In 2002, he enjoyed an unexpected comeback as the Windex-toting Gus Portokalos in the hit movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", a role he reprised on the short-lived television series \"My Big Fat Greek Life\", and a sequel film with the original cast, \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\", which was released on March 25, 2016.\n\nConstantine was cast as the historical John Chisum in the 1965 episode, \"Paid in Full\", on the syndicated television anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Ronald Reagan. Keith Andes portrayed Rob Hunter, a former Confederate colonel who visits Kathy McLennan (Aneta Corsaut), the wife of a soldier who had been killed while serving under Hunter in the American Civil War. He discovers that McLennan and her neighboring ranchers have been defrauded by Chisum, who issued legally unclaimable IOUs when he purchased their stock. Hunter works to recover the money owed to the ranchers. He also appeared in another 1965 \"Death Valley Days\" episode, \"The Great Turkey War\", with Parley Baer cast as journalist Horace Greeley.\n\nConstantine's other television appearances include:\n\n\n"}

Whole grains are a source of carbohydrates, multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.\n\nWhole grain sources include:\n\nCereals\n\nMinor cereals\n\nPseudocereals\n\nWhole grains are a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber, recommended for children and adults in several daily servings containing a variety of foods that meet whole grain-rich criteria.\n\nBy supplying high dietary fiber content, as part of a general healthy diet, consumption of whole grains is associated with lower risk of several diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and type 2 diabetes, with lower all-cause mortality. Regular whole-grain consumption lowers LDL and triglyceride levels, which contributes to an overall 26% reduction in coronary heart disease-risk factors. In addition, whole-grain consumption is inversely related to hypertension, diabetes, and obesity when compared to refined grains, all of which are negative indicators in total cardiovascular health.\n\nAs components of breakfast cereals, whole grains are associated with improved micronutrient intake and lower risk of several diseases. Their effects on gastrointestinal health, risk of obesity and cognition need further evaluation.\n\nKeeping grains as close to their original form as possible slows or prevents the digestion of starch, and a slower digestion is responsible for preventing spikes in blood sugar (over time spikes in blood sugar may lead to insulin resistance).\n\nCereals proteins have low quality, due to deficiencies in essential amino acids, mainly lysine. Supplementation of cereals with proteins from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth. In contrast, the proteins of the pseudocereals have a high nutritional value, close to those of casein (the main protein in milk). Quinoa and amaranth are the most nutritious grains due to their high content and quality of proteins, with high levels of lysine and other essential amino acids. Minor cereals and pseudocereals are a good alternative to replace gluten-containing cereals, for people who need to follow a gluten-free diet.\n\nManufacturers of foods containing whole grains in specified amounts are allowed a health claim for marketing purposes in the United States, stating: \"low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors\" and \"diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain some types of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may reduce the risk of heart disease, a disease associated with many factors\". The scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) related to health claims on gut health/bowel function, weight control, blood glucose/insulin levels, weight management, blood cholesterol, satiety, glycaemic index, digestive function and cardiovascular health is \"that the food constituent, whole grain, (...) is not sufficiently characterised in relation to the claimed health effects\" and \"that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption of whole grain and the claimed effects considered in this opinion.\"\n\nIn genetically susceptible people, gluten (proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, oat, and related species and hybrids) can trigger coeliac disease. Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the general population in developed countries. There is evidence that most cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet.\n\nWhile coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to wheat proteins, it is not the same as a wheat allergy. Other diseases triggered by eating gluten are non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, (estimated to affect 0.5% to 13% of the general population), gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis.\n\nIn the United States wholegrain products can be identified by the ingredients list. \"Wheat flour\" (as opposed to \"wholegrain wheat flour\" or \"whole-wheat flour\") as the first ingredient is not a clear indicator of the product's wholegrain content. If two ingredients are listed as grain products but only the second is listed as wholegrain, the entire product may contain between 1% and 49% wholegrain. Many breads are colored brown (often with molasses or caramel color) and made to look like wholegrain when they are not. In addition, some food manufacturers make foods with wholegrain ingredients, but, because wholegrain ingredients are not the dominant ingredient, they are not wholegrain products. Contrary to popular belief, wholegrains are \"not\" indicative of fiber. The amount of fiber varies from grain to grain, and some products may have things like bran, peas, or other foods added to boost the fiber content.\n\nIn Canada, it is legal to advertise any food product as \"whole wheat\" with up to 70% of the germ removed. While the resulting product will contain the benefit of fiber in the nutritional information, it lacks the nutritional content found in the wheat germ. Canadian consumers can be assured of whole-grain products by a label stating 100% whole-grain whole wheat.\n\nSimilar to the distinction between whole and refined grains is that between whole pulses (peas, beans, and other related vegetables) and refined dal (a preparation of pulses or the thick stew prepared from these).\n\nFrom AACC (American Association of Cereal Chemists) definition: \"Whole grains shall consist of the intact, ground, cracked or flaked caryopsis, whose principal anatomical components - the starchy endosperm, germ and bran - are present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact caryopsis.\"\n\nThe following names indicate whole-grain products, in accordance with the federal government:\n\nThere are multiple grains such as cereal grains (e.g. wheat, rice, oats, barley, corn, wild rice, and rye) as well as pseudocereals (e.g. quinoa and buckwheat) that may be labeled whole grains.\n\nWhen wheat is milled to make flour, the parts of the grain are usually separated and then are recombined to make specific types of flour, such as whole wheat, whole grain, white cake and pastry flour, and all-purpose white flour. If all parts of the kernel are used in the same relative proportions as they exist in the original kernel, then the flour is considered whole grain.\n\nUnder the Food and Drug Regulations, up to 5% of the kernel can be removed to help reduce rancidity and prolong the shelf life of whole-wheat flour. The portion of the kernel that is removed for this purpose contains much of the germ and some of the bran. If this portion of the kernel has been removed, the flour would no longer be considered whole grain.\n\nIn the UK the legally protected term is wholemeal rather than wholegrain. There are voluntary guidelines on what can be labelled a wholegrain product.\n\n\n"}

It was first published by Random House on January 22, 1990. It was his last book to be published during his lifetime. The book concerns the journey of life and its challenges.\n\nThough written in the style of classics such as \"Green Eggs and Ham\" and \"The Cat in the Hat\", \"Oh, the Places You’ll Go!\" has many specific characters including a narrator and the reader. A young boy, referred to simply as \"you\", initiates the action of the story. However, the presence of a main character helps readers to identify with the book. It is written in second person and uses future tense.\n\nThe story begins with the narrator, relating the decision of the unnamed protagonist (who represents the reader) to leave town. The protagonist travels through several geometrical and polychromatic landscapes and places, eventually encountering a place simply called \"The Waiting Place\", which is ominously addressed as being a place where everyone is always waiting for something to happen. As the protagonist continues to explore, spurred on by the thoughts of places he will visit and things he will discover, the book cheerfully concludes with an open end.\n\nUpon its original release in 1990, \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\" reached number one on \"The New York Times\" Best-Selling Fiction Hardcover list. That made Dr. Seuss one of the handful of authors to have number one Hardcover Fiction and Nonfiction books on the list; among them are John Steinbeck, Jimmy Buffett and Mitch Albom; his \"You're Only Old Once!\" hit number one on the Nonfiction list in 1986.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\" is a popular gift for students graduating from high school and college, spiking in sales every spring. It reached number one on \"USA Today\"s Best Selling Book list in 1997, and reached #2 in 2015 and 2017. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, producers Ben Myron & Roland Joffé, at Lightmotive with Tristar Pictures, were set to produce a film adaptation of the book with Seuss penning the screenplay. A revised draft dated 8 May 1992 and penned by Richard LaGravenese was scripted, but the adaptation was never filmed.\n"}

BWAV is present in large parts of Africa, endemic in Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda. It is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites and results in a brief benign generalised infection with headache, skin rash, diarrhea and joint pain and lasts 4–5 days. The animal reservoir of the virus includes birds, monkeys and donkeys.\n\n\"Bwamba orthobunyavirus\" has a negative sense single stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome, and so is classified as a class V virus under the Baltimore classification system. The genome is segmented into three pieces, Large (L), Medium (M) and Small (S), which have a combined length of approximately 12,000nt. The S RNA encodes a nucleocapsid and non structural proteins, the M RNA encodes envelope glycoproteins and a non structural membrane polypeptide and the L RNA encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase.\nThe segmented RNAs are surrounded by nucleocapsid proteins that form a Ribonucleoprotein complex, that associates with RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The complex is surrounded by a lipid layer, into which the nuclear complex interacts. Finally the particle is membrane bound, spherical, and in total is approximately 100 nm in diameter.\n\nOnce inside a host cell cytoplasm, the genomic RNA’s are transcribed into mRNA’s by the associated RNA polymerase. From these transcripts, the host machinery is used for translation into viral proteins. The S segment is slightly different from the rest as it is ambisense, meaning genes run in both the positive and negative directions. To enable correct translation of the proteins, a second round of transcription has to occur.\n\nTo replicate the genome, transcription occurs to produce a replicative intermediate, which is then itself transcribed into new RNA genomes, with the aid of the RNA polymerases produced from the gene expression.\n\nIn 1937, Bwamba fever was first recognized as a clinical illness among construction workers building a road to Bwamba County, Western Uganda, present day Bundibugyo District. Bwamba fever is present in large parts of Africa and antibodies of the virus have been found ‘as far south as the Republic of South Africa and as far north westwards as Gambia’. \nBwamba fever is endemic in several African countries, including Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda, where the virus was initially discovered. The distribution of the virus tends to be underestimated because the symptoms are relatively mild and are often mistaken for malaria.\n\n\"Bwamba orthobunyavirus\" is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The main anthropophilic vectors are \"Anopheles gambiae\" and \"Anopheles funestus\".\n\nThe animal reservoir includes birds, monkeys and donkeys, which have been found to possess antibodies to Bwamba virus.\n\nBwamba fever presents itself as a severe, but benign generalised infection of short duration, usually only lasting four to five days. Symptoms include fever, headache, arthralgia, and local as well as generalised pain. No fatalities have been recorded so far. \"Exanthem is nearly always present and is frequently associated with meningeal involvement. [...] Intestinal tract involvement, especially diarrhea, is also seen. Some patients may also develop a body rash\", as reported by the Uganda Virus Research Institute, who also discovered the disease in the 1940s.\n\n\n"}

The name Nectan means \"pure\" or \"clear\" and was popular in at least one Pictish royal branch.\n\nThree brothers are recorded in the thirteenth century: Gilchrist, Athe and Gilbert, all sons of Malcolm Macnachten. In 1297 Gilchrist received a charter from Alexander III of Scotland which granted to him the keepership of a castle warding the narrow Pass of Brander, which was the gateway to the west.\n\nThe Macnaghtens came to Loch Awe and as a result became neighbours of the powerful and acquisitive Clan Campbell. The Campbells were quick to support Robert the Bruce when he set out to claim his throne; however, the Macnaghtens, who were under the influence of the Clan MacDougall, opposed him. The Macnaghtens formed part of the MacDougall host that fought against Robert the Bruce's army at the Battle of the Pass of Brander in 1306 and again at the Battle of Dalrigh. However the Macnaghtens later changed their allegiance and a \"Baron Macnachten\" (possibly Alexander Macnachten) is recorded as fighting at the Battle of Bannockburn for the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence. The Macnaghtens did not gain much from their late change of allegiance and from that point onwards the Campbells dominated Loch Awe.\n\nThe second wife of Alexander Macnaghten, who may have fought at Bannockburn, was Christina Campbell. When she became a widow in 1361 she granted one third of the Macnaghten lands to her cousin, Colin Campbell of Lochow. Alexander Macnaghten's son, Duncan, succeeded to the rest of the lands. His seat was at Dunderave Castle and Dunderave became the territorial designation of the clan chiefs.\n\nIn 1478 Duncan's heir, Alexander, accepted a charter from the Campbell Earls of Argyll for his lands and thus accepted them as feudal superiors. His grandson, also called Alexander, was knighted by James IV of Scotland. He followed the king to the Battle of Flodden and was one of the few survivors of the battle. He died two years later but had married twice and left six sons, the eldest of which succeeded as clan chief. The second son was Ian, father of another Ian or \"John Dhu\" who could be the \"Shane Dhu\" who is credited with founding the Irish branch of Clan Macnaghten.\n\nGilbert Macnaghten succeeded as clan chief in 1548 but died without issue and was therefore succeeded by his younger brother, Alexander. Alexander started the rebuilding of Dunderave Castle on Loch Fyne which was completed by his son, Iain, in 1596.\n\nThe Macnaghten chiefs raised a force of bowmen to go and assist the French Huguenot rebels in the Siege of La Rochelle in 1627. The chief of Clan Macnaghten was in high favour with Charles I of England and served as a Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber but the expense of the French expedition and the extravagance of living in court forced Macnaghten to mortgage his lands. Alexander died in 1630 leaving Dunderave in the hands of his brother, Macolm Macnaghten of Killearn.\n\nMalcolm's son was a royalist and called out his clan to fight in Glencairn's rising against Oliver Cromwell in 1653. After the Restoration of 1660 Macnaghten was knighted but through the influence of Campbell, Earl of Argyll he was later denounced as a rebel. As a result, the clan lands were nearly entirely lost by debt and the next chief, Iain, inherited little more than an empty title.\n\nIain joined the forces of John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee and fought at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. As a result, he was denounced as a Jacobite rebel and his remaining lands were forfeited. His younger son, John Macnaghten, was the last chief of this line. John was forced to make a formal disposition of his remaining lands to Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglas in 1710.\n\nIn 1818 Edmund Alexander Macnaghten was recognized as the new clan chief. He was descended from the Irish branch of Macnaghtens who are descended from John Macnaughten \"Shane Dhu\" of the 16th century. Edmund Alexander Macnaghten died in 1832 and was succeeded by his brother, Francis, who was a judge in Madras and Calcutta. Francis was a distinguished lawyer and became a Lord of Appeal in 1887. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Edward, whose two sons were both killed in World War I. They were succeeded by their uncle Sir Francis, eighth Baronet.\n\n\nCastles that have been owned by the MacNaughtons or MacNaughts, who were a branch of the MacNaughtons, have included:\n\n\n\nMacnaghten, Macnauchtan, Macnachten, Macnaught, MacNaughtan, Macnaughtan, Macnaughtens, MacNaughton, Macnechtan, McNaughton, McNaughten, McNaughtan, MacNaught, McKnaight, McNaught, MacKnight, McKnight, McNutt, McNitt, McNett, McKnatt, McNatt\n\n"}

{"id": "2052678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052678", "title": "Great Unconformity", "text": "Great Unconformity\n\nOf the many unconformities (gaps) observed in geological strata, the term Great Unconformity is frequently applied to either the unconformity observed by James Hutton in 1787 at Siccar Point in Scotland, or that observed by John Wesley Powell in the Grand Canyon in 1869. Both instances are exceptional examples of where the contacts between sedimentary strata and either sedimentary or crystalline strata of greatly different ages, origins, and structure represent periods of geologic time sufficiently long to raise great mountains and then erode them away.\n\nUnconformities tend to reflect long-term changes in the pattern of the accumulation of sedimentary or igneous strata in low-lying areas (often ocean basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea, but also Bangladesh and much of Brazil), then being uplifted and eroded (such as the ongoing Himalayan orogeny, the older Laramide orogeny of the Rocky Mountains, or much older Appalachian (Alleghanian) and Ouachita orogenies), then subsequently subsiding, eventually to be buried under younger sediments. The intervening periods of tectonic uplift are generally periods of mountain building, often due to the collision of tectonic plates. The \"great\" unconformities of regional or continental scale (in both geography and chronology) are associated with either global changes in eustatic sea level or the supercontinent cycle, the periodic merger of all the continents into one approximately every 500 million years.\n\nHutton's Unconformity at Siccar Point, in county of Berwickshire on the east coast of Scotland, is an angular unconformity that consists of gently dipping, reddish, Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous breccias, sandstones, and conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone overlying deeply eroded, near-vertical, greyish, Silurian (Llandovery) greywackes and shales. The Llandovery greywackes and graptolite-bearing shales of the Gala Group were deposited by turbidity currents in a deep sea environment about 425 million years ago. The overlying Devonian strata were deposited by rivers and streams about 345 million years ago. Thus, this unconformity reflects a gap of about 80 million years during which deep sea sediments were lithified, folded, and uplifted; later deeply eroded and weathered subaerially; and finally buried by river and stream sediments.\n\nExposures of the unconformity at Siccar Point, provided James Hutton, accompanied by John Playfair and Sir James Hall, the clearest example of an unconformable relationship between two sets of sedimentary strata that involved a complex geological history. The clear truncation of near-vertical Silurian sedimentary strata by well-bedded conglomerates and sandstones belonging to the Upper Old Red Sandstone allowed Hutton to demonstrate the existence of significant breaks in the geological record, in this case a break separating strata that were then called \"alpine schistus\" and \"secondary strata.\" This and other unconformites provided evidence for Hutton's ideas about the \"recycling\" of geological materials and for unconformities representing very large time periods He argued that these concepts pointed to the great antiquity of the Earth and the vastness of the geological time-scale.\n\nThe Great Unconformity of Powell in the Grand Canyon is a regional unconformity that separates the Tonto Group from the underlying, faulted and tilted sedimentary rocks of the Grand Canyon Supergroup and vertically foliated metamorphic and igneous rocks of the Vishnu Basement Rocks. The unconformity between the Tonto Group and the Vishnu Basement Rocks is a nonconformity. The break between the Tonto Group and the Grand Canyon Supergroup is an angular unconformity.\n\nPowell's Great Unconformity is part of a continent-wide unconformity that extends across Laurentia, the ancient core of North America. It was first recognized twelve years before Powell's expedition by John Newberry in New Mexico, during the Ives expedition of 1857-1858. However, the disruption of the American Civil War kept Newberry's work from becoming widely known. This Great Unconformity marks the progressive submergence of this landmass by a shallow cratonic sea and its burial by shallow marine sediments of the Cambrian-Early Ordovician Sauk sequence. The submergence of Laurentia ended a lengthy period of widespread continental denudation that exhumed and deeply eroded Precambrian rocks and exposed them to extensive physical and chemical weathering at the Earth's surface. As a result, Powell's Great Unconformity is unusual in its geographic extent and its stratigraphic significance.\n\nThe length of time represented by Powell's Great Unconformity varies along its length. Within the Grand Canyon, the Great Unconformity represents a period of about 175 million years between the Tonto Group and the youngest subdivision, the Sixtymile Formation, of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. At the base of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, where it truncates the Bass Formation, the period of time represented by this angular unconformity increases to about 725 million years. Where the Tonto Group overlies the Vishnu Basement Rocks, the Great Unconformity represents a period as much as 1.2 to 1.6 billion years. (See also geological timescale.)\nA prominent exposure of Powell's Great Unconformity occurs in Frenchman Mountain in Nevada. Frenchman Mountain exposes a sequence of Phanerozoic strata equivalent to those found in the Grand Canyon. At the base of this sequence, the Great Unconformity, with the Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group overlying the Vishnu Basement Rocks, is well exposed in a manner that is atypical and scientifically significant in its combination of extent and accessibility. This exposure is frequently illustrated in popular and educational publications, and is often part of geological fieldtrips. There is a gap of about 1.2 billion years where 550 million year old strata of the Tapeats Sandstone rests on 1.7 billion (1700 million) year old Vishnu Basement Rocks.\n\nThe term \"Great Unconformity\" has also been used to refer to the anomalous concentration of unconformities, including basement nonconformites, below the base of the Cambrian. Charles Walcott was among the first to note this phenomenon, remarking in 1910:\n\nA potential link has been proposed between such sub-Cambrian unconformities and glacial erosion during the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations. Alternatively, it has been proposed that multiple smaller events, such as the formation and breakup of Rodinia, created many unconformities worldwide.Evidence indicates that the Pikes Peak unconformity was formed before the Snowball Earth glaciations.\n\nThere is currently no widely accepted explanation for the Great Unconformity among geoscientists. There are theories that have been proposed; it is widely accepted that there was a combination of more than one event which may have caused such an extensive phenomenon. One example is a large glaciation event which took place during the Neoproterozoic, starting around 1 billion years ago. This is also when a significant glaciation event known as ‘Snowball Earth’ occurred. Snowball Earth covered almost the entire planet with ice. The areas which underwent glaciation were approximately those where the Great Unconformity is located today. When glaciers move, they drag and erode sediment away from the underlying rock. This would explain how a large section of rock was taken away from widespread areas around the same time.\n\n\n\n"}

It is known to cause disease in animals including humans. It is an alphavirus found in central, eastern, and southern Africa.\n\nThe Semliki Forest virus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of approximately 13,000 base pairs which encodes nine proteins. The 5’ two thirds of the genome encode four non-structural proteins concerned with RNA synthesis and the structural proteins are encoded in the 3’ third. Of the structural proteins, the C proteins makes up the icosahedral capsid which is enveloped by a lipid bilayer, derived from the host cell. The outermost surface of the virus is almost entirely covered by heterodimers of glycoproteins E1 and E2, arranged in interconnective trimers, which form an outer shell. Trimers are anchored in the membrane by an E2 cytoplasmic domain that associates with the nucleocapsid.\n\nReplication occurs via a negative strand intermediate giving rise to a full length genomic RNA for export in new virions and a subgenomic message that is translated into the structural proteins.\n\nSemliki Forest virus is spread mainly by mosquito bites. It is not able to infect mammals through inhalation or gastrointestinal exposure, although rodents in the laboratory can be infected by intranasal instillation. The virus is able to cause a lethal encephalitis in rodents, but generally only mild symptoms in humans. Only one lethal human infection has been reported. In this one case, the patient was speculated to be immunodeficient and potentially had been exposed to large amounts of virus in the laboratory.\n\nSemliki Forest virus has been used extensively in biological research as a model of the viral life cycle and of viral neuropathy. Due to its broad host range and efficient replication, it has also been developed as a vector for genes encoding vaccines and anti-cancer agents, and as a tool in gene therapy.\n\nSince Semliki Forest virus naturally infects cells of the central nervous system it has been pre-clinically tested as an oncolytic virus against the severe brain tumour type glioblastoma. The SFV virus was genetically modified with microRNA target sequences so that it only replicated in brain tumour cells and not in normal brain cells. The modified virus reduced tumour growth and prolonged survival of mice with brain tumours. The modified virus was also found to efficiently kill human glioblastoma tumour cell lines.\n\n"}
{"id": "2052682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052682", "title": "Republic of Korea Marine Corps", "text": "Republic of Korea Marine Corps\n\nThe Republic of Korea Marine Corps (), also known as the ROK Marine Corps (ROKMC), or the ROK Marines, is the marine corps of South Korea. The ROKMC is a branch of the Republic of Korea Navy responsible for amphibious operations, and also functions as a rapid reaction force and a strategic reserve.\n\nThe ROKMC was founded as a suppression operations force against communist partisans in 1949, prior to the Korean War. The ROKMC also fought in combat during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe ROK Marine Corps, with 29,000 personnel, is organized into two divisions and two separate brigades under the Headquarters ROK Marine Corps. The ROK Marine Corps has about 300 tracked vehicles including assault amphibious vehicles, main battle tanks, and self-propelled artillery.\n\nOn April 15, 1949, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC) was founded at Deoksan airfield in Jinhae with an initial strength of 380 men. Lieutenant Colonel Shin Hyun-joon was appointed to lead as the first Commandant of the newly formed Marine Corps and he was promoted to Colonel on July 1, 1949. The ROKMC consisted of 2 rifle companies and a headquarters company equipped with many secondhand weapons from the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) used during World War II, including the 7.7 mm Type 99 Light Machine Gun. It was soon reorganized into an infantry battalion with three rifle companies. Initially no United States Marine Corps (USMC) or United States Army advisers were attached to the unit and its doctrine and training was based on that of the IJA. \n\nIn September 1949 two rifle companies were sent to Jinju on anti-guerilla operations and in December the entire battalion was sent to Jeju-do for anti-guerilla operations following the Jeju Uprising. A 37mm anti-tank platoon was added to the battalion in this period.\n\nFollowing the start of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 the \"Kokilhun\" Marine rifle battalion was sent to Kunsan where they delayed the advance of the Korean People's Army (KPA) forces and earned the Marines the nickname of the \"Ghost Killers.\" The Marines were rapidly expanded to three battalions and redesignated as the 1st KMC Regiment and took part in fighting at Mokpo, Changhang, Chinjongri, Jinju, Namwom and Masan.\n\nOn 23 August the Marines landed on Kueje Island and fought a KPA force there until 15 September. On 5 September operational control of the Regiment was passed to the USMC 5th Marine Regiment and after undergoing further training by Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) advisers at Pusan the regiment was embarked on on 12 September and sailed for Inchon.\n\nOn the afternoon of 15 September the regiment landed at Red Beach, Inchon and was assigned the task of mopping up KPA forces in Inchon. The next day the USMC 5th and 1st Marine Regiments were ordered to move along the Inchon-Seoul highway and capture Kimpo Air Base. The 3rd KMC Battalion was assigned to protect the 5th Marines left flank and capture high ground near Ascom City west of Kimpo. On the morning of 17 September the 3rd KMC Battalion began clearing Ascom City, a two square mile maze of huts in which many KPA had taken shelter. The Ascom City area was eventually secured on 18 September On 19 September after advancing to the Han River near Seoul the 5th Marines were ordered to cross the Han near Haengju, seize Hill 125 and then move southeast along the railway lines. The 2nd KMC Battalion crossed the Han on Amphibious Tractors and occupied Hill 95 overlooking the crossing site. Meanwhile, the 3rd KMC Battalion at Kimpo called in airstrikes against a KPA unit forming up to try to retake the airfield. On 22 September the 1st KMC Battalion with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines and 1st Battalion, 5th Marines began advancing into Seoul, meeting heavy KPA resistance the 1st KMC was forced to retreat to its starting point. On 23 September the 1st KMC renewed their attack but were met by heavy fire losing 32 killed and 68 wounded. The 1st KMC was withdrawn into reserve and replaced by the 2nd KMC Battalion, while the 5th Marines eventually overran the KPA strongpoint on Hill 105S. On 25 September the USMC began their final assault on Seoul with the 2nd KMC assigned to the 1st Marines to move through the central city to the northeast while the 1st KMC assigned to the 5th Marines would seize the Capital Building and the northwest of the city. Meeting a stubborn defense from entrenched KPA forces the 7th Marine Regiment joined the battle on 26 September. By the afternoon of 28 September the center of the city had been cleared of KPA troops and on 29 September despite ongoing fighting in the suburbs the Government of Korea was formally reinstated in Seoul. The Regiment less the 1st and 3rd Battalions was deployed east of Seoul to block the KPA retreat but encountered only scattered resistance.\n\nOn 18 October the three KMC battalions were embarked on ships for the landing at Wonsan, eventually going ashore there on 25 October. On 2 November the Regiment was given responsibility for the zone south of the 39th Parallel. In late November the Regiment was attached to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. Following the attacks by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir the Regiment withdrew to Wonsan to cover the evacuation of United Nations Command (UN) Forces. Between 7 and 9 December the 1st and 3rd KMC Battalions were evacuated from Wonsan by ship, while on 15 December the 2nd and 5th KMC Battalions were evacuated by air from Hungnam. The Regiment reformed at Jinhae in mid-December.\n\nAfter a period of rest and refitting, including training by USMC advisers, the Regiment was assigned to the 1st Marine Division in mid-January 1951. On 24 January the Regiment joined the 1st Marine Division which was conducting anti-guerilla operations against the KPA 10th Division. On 12 February the Regiment, less the 5th Battalion, was attached to the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) Capital Division at Samcheok. The 5th Battalion meanwhile was sent to Inchon and then occupied the Kimpo peninsula, it would operate independently from the Regiment until March 1952. \n\nOn 17 March 1951 as they participated in Operation Ripper the Regiment was permanently attached to the 1st Marine Division and the 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines was assigned to provide artillery support to the Regiment. Ripper was followed immediately by Operation Rugged and then Operation Dauntless in which the Regiment crossed the Bukhan River and captured the Hwacheon Dam. The Chinese Spring Offensive which started on 22 April was met with a strong defence by the 1st and 2nd KMC Battalions and the 5th Marines and by 23 April they had successfully repelled the PVA attacks. However, with neighbouring units withdrawing the Marines were ordered back to the high ground between the Soyang and Hongcheon Rivers. With the PVA offensive blunted by 20 May the UN launched its May–June 1951 counteroffensive and on 22 May the Regiment made its initial advance to take objectives north of the front. The advance made rapid progress and by the end of May the Regiment was on the south bank of the Hwacheon Reservoir where it was relieved on 2 June by the ROK 3rd Regiment. \n\nOn 4 June 1951 the Regiment was brought out of reserve to join the 1st Marine Division in an assault on the PVA/KPA main line of resistance along a mountain range extending from Yanggu to Hill 1316 (Daeamsan). The area was defended by a regiment of the KPA 12th Division with orders to hold the position until death. from 4 to 9 June the Regiment fought the KPA making limited progress. Finally on 10 June the Regiment commander Colonel Kim Tae Shik decided to make a night attack on the KPA positions. Launched at 02:00 on 11 June the attack caught the KPA unprepared and the Marines quickly overran Hill 1122 and the rest of the ridgeline. Following the capture of Daeamsan the Marines continued to push against the PVA/KPA to obtain better positions. On 15 June the 2nd KMC Battalion attacked north to Hill 1304 which it captured the next day. The 3rd KMC Battalion moved northwest and captured Dusol-san () following which they dug in. On 7 July the Regiment was ordered to take Daeusan (), beginning their attack on 8 July. After suffering over 220 casualties the attack was called off on 12 July.\n\nThe Regiment and the 1st Marine Division went into reserve and the Regiment received intensive training from USMC advisers. At the end of this period it was organized like a USMC regiment with three infantry battalions, a regimental headquarters, a 4.2-inch mortar company and a 75mm recoilless rifle platoon. Lieutenant Colonel Kim Dong Ha, who replaced the wounded Colonel Kim Tae Shik as Regiment commander.\n\nOn 27 August the 1st Marine Division and the Regiment returned to the frontline to lead the Battle of the Punchbowl ultimately gaining control of the line of hills north of the Punchbowl by 21 September.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Punchbowl the fighting stabilized into static warfare with numerous foot patrols far into PVA/KPA territory and company-strength tank-infantry raids. Throughout the remainder of 1951, the 1st Marine Division continued to occupy the eastern portion of the X Corps defense sector in east-central Korea. From left to right the 1st KMC Regiment, 7th Marines and 1st Marines held the main line of resistance with two battalions each. The 5th Marines remained in reserve until 11 November when it relieved the 1st Marines, which went into reserve. As Marines continued patrols and efforts to improve their defenses, the KMC added its own artillery support, the 1st Korean Artillery Battalion consisting of two medium (155mm) and two light (105mm) howitzer batteries.\n\nIn early 1952 the 2nd KMC Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kim Doo Chan, was organized as were engineer and medical companies. In the spring of 1952, the 1st Marine Division, along with the 1st KMC Regiment, received orders to move across the peninsula to western Korea. The regiment was the first unit to move to its new positions along the extreme left flank of the Eighth Army, where it was given the mission of guarding the approaches to Seoul along the Jamestown Line. By 24 March, the 1st Marine Division and 1st KMC Regiment had relieved elements of the ROK 1st Division along the left sector of the main line of resistance, adjacent to the 1st Commonwealth Division, and were in position to continue sector outpost security and ground defense in what had become a war of attrition.\n\nOn 20 March 1952 the 1st KMC Regiment assumed responsibility for its portion of the Jamestown Line between the Kimpo Provisional Regiment and the 1st Marines (replaced by the 5th Marines on 29 March. From 25-31 March the PVA made five separate probing attacks against the 1st KMC Regiment. On 1 April the KPA launched an attack on the 1st KMC positions in an attempt to capture the Freedom Gate Bridge over the Imjin River but were pushed back by dawn on 2 April. On 12-13 April the PVA increased their attacks by fire and infantry probes of the 1st Marine Division sector and on the night of 17 April launched an attack on the 1st KMC positions but this was beaten back with small arms and artillery fire with the 1st KMC losing two dead while the PVA lost 36 killed. On 23 and 24 April the 1st Marine Division withdrew from most of its outpost line reducing the vulnerability of these isolated positions and strengthening the main line of resistance.\n\nOn 5 May 1952, the Korean Marine Corps Tank Company was formed consisting of 181 men with 17 M4 Sherman tanks and one tank retriever. The company received its training in combat under the direction of USMC Company A, 1st Tank Battalion. The entire company was committed on 12 July to relieve Company A in support of the 1st KMC Regiment. Following a period of small unit actions along the main line of resistance, starting in August the 1st KMC participated in the Battle of Bunker Hill. On the night of 31 October 1952 as the 5th KMC Battalion was relieving the 3rd KMC Battalion on the right of the Regiment's position the PVA attacked the positions. Both Battalions held their positions and the PVA withdrew before dawn on 1 November leaving more than 295 dead.\n\nIn early May 1953 the 1st KMC Regiment went into reserve, returning to the frontline in July when it defended its positions against PVA probes during the Battle of the Berlin Outposts and Boulder City.\n\nWith the end of the war on 27 July 1953 the Korean Marines had killed an estimated 22,070 PVA/KPA while suffering 2,529 casualties.\n\nIn 1955, the 1st Marine Division was established.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Chung Hee asked to participate in the Many Flags program and sent military units into Vietnam, despite opposition from both the Assembly and the public. In exchange, the United States agreed to reimburse additional military budgets to South Korea to help modernize its armed forces, totaling about a billion dollars.\n\nThe three main units deployed to Vietnam were the ROKMC's Blue Dragon Brigade (; Hanja: 靑龍; \"Cheongryeong\"), ROKA Capital Division and the White Horse Division. Various South Korean special forces units were also deployed. The Republic of Korea Army's Tactical Area of Responsibility was the southern half of the I Corps. The ROKMC was deployed with the I Corps, alongside U.S. Marines.\n\nIn 1974, Commander Lee Dong-Yong of the 1st Marine Division modified the 1st Division's infantry regiment to specialize its each of 3 battalions to Airborne/Amphibious Infiltration/Ranger. This system distinguishes the 1st Marine Division from other ROKMC divisions and brigades.\n\nIn 1982, ROKMC established the '812th \"Hammer\" Unit'. Their mission was to perform retaliation operations against the DPRK forces. The unit's motto was 'Kill'em all, Let God sort'em out'. Their training included a 10 km ruck march in an hour with full combat gear, and carrying a 100 kg IBS(Inflatable Boat Small) overhead. Training also included 12 km continuous sea swimming.\n\nIn November 1987, the Headquarters Republic of Korea Marine Corps was re-established; it was disbanded in October 1973 due to budget constraint.\n\nOn November 23, 2010, the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong incident occurred. There was a rigorous engagement between the North Korean army and a South Korean marine corps YP unit. As a result of this event, the South Korean government cancelled its Military Reform Plan 2020 which was to downsize the number of Marine Corps personnel deployed in North-West islands. Instead, the South Korean government established the Military Reform Plan 307 (Plan 307).\n\nPlan 307 affected ROKMC by deploying new ARTHUR artillery hunting radar to North-West islands until February 2012.\n\nWith Plan 307, Northwest Islands Defense Command (NWIDC) was established on June 15, 2011. ROKMC Commandant holds an additional position as NWIDC commander. With NWIDC, ROKMC Commandant can command Army, Navy, Airforce under NWIDC branch in actual combat situation.\n\nPlan 307 also includes a plan to fortify all 5 islands in the North-West area until 2015 by constructing bunkers for tanks, K-9 Thunder, K-10 ARV and civilians, digging trenches, establishing Guided-Missile unit which is equipped with 60 Spike missiles and 4 launchers, deploying the Hostile Artillery Locating System (HALO) which is manufactured by the Selex Galileo company, creating an AH-1S Cobra unit under the 6th Marine Brigade in Baengnyeongdo, increasing size of artillery units in Yeonpyeong from company to battalion which changed their number of K-9 Thunder from 6 to 18, deploying the K-SAM Chunma and the K-136 multiple rocket launcher to North-West islands and increasing numbers of marines in North-West islands by more than 1000.\nOn June 23, 2011, the South Korean National Assembly legislated a law that states the right that personnel management can be exercised by the ROKMC Commandant instead of the ROKN Chief of Naval Operations (Until 2011, the CNO exercised the latter), legislating the ROKMC Deputy Commandant, dividing and specifying ROKMC's main operation as 'amphibious operations' from ROKN 'naval operations', including the ROKMC Commandant as a formal member of the joint chiefs of the staff council, legislating the ROKMC Commandant as a member of the Defense Project Promotion Committee, giving him rights to select the uniform from CNO to the ROKMC Commandant and making the latter exercise the rights of the Management of Military Supplies of the ROKMC.\n\nBy dividing the ROKMC's main operation from ROKN, ROKMC made a stepping-stone to become a National Strategic Mobile Force.\n\nOn October 15, 2011, The law mentioned above took effect. ROKMC retrieved their record of service back from ROKN on October 13. ROKMC started issuing new uniforms since October 1. The ROKMC used to wear their own distinct uniforms before 1973, but after the ROKMC HQ were dissolved, South Korean marines had to wear uniforms similar to those used by the South Korean navy (sans the sailor caps). This new uniform is different from the new uniform of the ROKA, ROKN and the ROKAF (these 3 forces use same uniform). The new uniform was designed to camouflage marine personnel for amphibious operations by using colors of beach, sand and seaweed.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Ministry of National Defense confirmed a plan to distribute 32 amphibious mobile helicopters to ROKMC. The ROKMC scheduled to activate an aviation group between 2017 and 2020 with 2 amphibious mobile helicopter battalions and 1 attack helicopter battalion with Colonel in chief.\n\nThe marine corps, with 29,000 personnel, is organized into two divisions and two brigades under the Headquarters Republic of Korea Marine Corps. The Commandant of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps is a three-star general. After the bombardment of Yeonpyeong, the Commandant of the ROKMC also holds the commander position of the NWIDC (Northwest Islands Defense Command). The 1st Marine Division can operate in sea, air, land, with specializing its three infantry battalions under a single regiment to Airborne/Amphibious Assault/Ranger. Furthermore, the ROKMC's Recon units (two Reconnaissance Battalions and one Reconnaissance Company) hold various special warfare trainings such as scuba and parachuting.\n\nIn March 2016, the South Korean defense ministry announced the creation of a new \"Spartan 3000\" regiment consisting of 3,000 of South Korean marines. The unit will be combat ready to be deployed in any part of the Korean Peninsula within 24 hours in case of an attack from the DPRK forces and will be responsible for targeting high priority targets in North Korea including nuclear facilities. This new announcement also aims to make the ROK deployment strategy more efficient as it aims to be able to deploy a ROKMC regiment within 24 hours instead of the current 48 hours.\n\nThe ROKMC relies on the ROK Navy for medical treatment of its wounded, as specially trained Navy medics are to some extent integrated into the Marine Corps' units and also instructing fundamental first-aid techniques to new recruits (similar to the US Navy's Corpsmen).\n\n\nIn the South Korean armed forces, ranks fall into one of four categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and junior enlisted (\"\"Byeong\"\"), in decreasing order of authority.\n\nCommissioned officer ranks are subdivided into \"\"Jangseong\"\"-level (general) officers, \"\"Yeonggwan\"\"-level (field-grade) officers, and \"\"Wigwan\"\"-level (company-grade) officers.\nAll branches of the South Korean armed forces maintain a single Warrant Officer rank known as \"Junwi\". Warrant Officers fall in between non-commissioned and commissioned officers. The rank is denoted by a gold-colored \"Sowi\" insignia.\nIn the South Korean armed forces, personnel with ranks of \"Hasa\" through \"Wonsa\" are considered non-commissioned officers. There are enlisted ranks called \"Corporal\" and \"Sergeant\" in English, but they are not considered non-commissioned officer ranks, though they are treated as one if they hold an NCO position. \"Ideungbyeong\" (Korean: 이등병; Hanja: 2等兵), \"Ildeungbyeong\" (일등병; 1等兵), and \"Sangdeungbyeong\" (상등병; 上等兵) are commonly referred to as \"Ibyeong\", \"Ilbyeong\", and \"Sangbyeong\" respectively.\nAcquisition plans are tied to Army procurement and focus on increasing tactical mobility, firepower, and command and control.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, the ROKMC fleet of Amphibious Vehicles consisted of 61 Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVT) and 42 AAV7A1. In the early 1980s all Amtracs in ROKMC service were modified to LVTP7A1 standard, but the original variant remained for many more years in service. In an effort to replace the LVTs, the ROKMC undertook a 57 AAV7A1 co-production contract, later increased with an additional 67 AAV7A1 vehicles. Since 1998, South Korea had deployed these 124 new vehicles to enhance its defense against North Korea as well as replacing its current fleet consisting of obsolete vehicles.\n\nThe Marine Corps has no aircraft of its own, thus relying on aerial support from the Army and Navy. The service plans to create an aviation brigade with transport and KAI Surion attack helicopters by 2015. To strengthen its intelligence-gathering and surveillance capabilities, the service also is considering deploying unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance.\n\nThe current M48A3K Main Battle Tanks are being replaced by around 50 to 60 K1 tanks. To support the force, K-55, K9 self-propelled howitzers and KH-179 towed howitzers are used.\nThe individual equipment may vary. The old ERDL type camouflage is still in use with training units, although it has been phased out largely by the ROKMC's new digital camouflage. The M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment, alongside large backpacks (similar to the ALICE backpacks) are still used, though most units now have been issued newer, updated LCE gear or combat vests and often also body-armor/plate-carriers and modern rucksacks with MOLLE webbing.\nThe helmets in use are of the traditional steel-type (similar to the M1 and M80) and Kevlar helmets. Some units, such as Recon units, prefer the use of boonie hats.\n\nIn 2013, the ROKMC procured four Plasan Sandcat light protected vehicles with 67 Spike NLOS guided missiles.\n\nBy the end of 2017, ROK Marine Corps forces are to deploy the Bigung (flying arrow) guided rocket system near the Northern Limit Line (NLL) along the western sea border to protect the islands of Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong from assault by North Korean hovercraft. The Bigung is a truck-mounted launcher that uses the LOGIR guided rocket, which is in diameter, long and weighs with a range of . Each system is capable of engaging multiple craft, with target acquisition and designation sights (TADS) and an uncooled infrared detector that can independently detect and track multiple targets simultaneously. Compared to coastal artillery, the system is more mobile and versatile, and can fire up to 36-40 rockets at once. The Agency for Defense Development partnered with LIG Nex1 for development and production.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052688", "title": "Chartered Insurance Institute", "text": "Chartered Insurance Institute\n\nThe Chartered Insurance Institute (also known as the CII) is a professional body for the insurance sector. The CII's purpose, as set out in its 1912 royal charter, is to 'Secure and justify the confidence of the public' in its members and the insurance sector as a whole. It aims to do this through setting standards of integrity, technical competence and business capability.\n\nIn February 2016 Sian Fisher joined the Chartered Insurance Institute as CEO, taking over Sandy Scott's 16-year tenure. In November 2016, she launched a Strategic Manifesto outlining a 5-year plan, the foundation of which remains to fulfil the Charter's purpose of building trust in insurance and its practice. The change programme is driven by four key core strategic themes\n\nThe first Insurance Institute was established in Manchester on 14 March 1873 with the aim of providing an environment for the social exchange of knowledge and ideas on the subject of insurance, with a particular focus on fire insurance, given the number of textile manufacturers in the city. The Insurance Institute of Manchester had a selective membership policy and required members to hold senior positions within the industry, which led to the creation of a Junior Insurance Institute (later Insurance Association of Manchester) in 1883 to provide education to those new to insurance.\n\nThe second local institute to be formed was the Insurance and Actuarial Society of Glasgow founded in 1881, which held education as its main focus. Following that the institutes of Ireland (in Dublin, 1885), Norwich (1886), Birmingham (1887), Yorkshire (in Leeds, 1888), Bristol (1890), Newcastle upon Tyne (1896) and Nottingham (1896), were formed, though with varying names, e.g. Insurance Social and Musical Society of Bristol.\n\nThere was a growing interest in the idea of a central institute which would bolster the work and profile of the existing institutes, and so in March 1897 a conference of representatives from the 10 institutes was held in Manchester, and it was decided that they should form an association called The Federation of Insurance Institutes of Great Britain and Ireland. At this conference it was also proposed that an annual journal of papers on insurance should be produced, that the institutes should jointly offer examinations and certificates, and that an insurance clerks’ orphanage should be established.\n\nInitially, the responsibility for the Journal was assumed by the Birmingham and Glasgow institutes, while the Yorkshire institute and the Manchester association prepared the educational programme, proposing that the Federation should act only as an examining body while local institutes undertook the teaching. The Insurance Clerks’ Orphanage was established as an independent organisation in 1902, operating out of the offices of the London Salvage Corps.\n\nAt the 1906 conference of the Federation it was decided that a royal charter should be sought and that the London Institute should act as a headquarters. In 1908, as a step towards gaining the charter, a constitution was agreed between the institutes and the name was changed to The Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. The royal charter was granted in 1912 and the Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland became the Chartered Insurance Institute. At this time there were 21 local institutes in Great Britain and Ireland and 4 affiliated institutes from within the British Empire.\n\nThe Royal Charter incorporating the Chartered Insurance Institute was granted on 17 January 1912 by His Majesty King George the Fifth. Each royal charter that is granted is unique in format and content as it is drawn up and contains the Bye-laws deemed relevant by the body to be incorporated. A new Supplemental Charter, replacing all former versions of the Charter, was granted by Queen Elizabeth the Second on 27 January 1987.\n\nArticle 3 of the CII's current Charter identifies the six \"objects and purposes for which the Institute is constituted\":\n\n\nAs a chartered body, the Chartered Insurance Institute has the right to grant specific chartered titles. CII members must first request the grant for a new title at a general meeting of the membership. This is followed by a petition to the Privy Council. If the Privy Council deem the petition agreeable, a minister signs an order allowing the CII to incorporate the right to grant and award the new title. The change is then duly inserted into the Institute's Bye-laws.\n\nThe CII has five chartered titles which may be conferred upon individuals in the profession depending upon their specialisation:\n\n\nIn addition, there are three Chartered titles to cover different specialisations for organisations in the insurance and financial advice profession:\n\n\nThe Insurance Hall is the headquarters of the CII, located at 20 Aldermanbury in the City of London. The building was proposed by Sir Frederick William Pascoe Rutter (the 1910-11 President) in a speech delivered in 1919 entitled The CII: Its right to work, in which he proposed that the CII should have its own building in London to act as a designated meeting place for members and to house a library to facilitate study. The purchase of the freehold on the land and the construction of the building was funded through donations amassed between 1919 and 1932, and debentures issued to insurance companies. The Insurance Hall was opened by King George V on 28 June 1934.\n\nThe Insurance Hall is a Grade-II listed building in a Tudorbethan style with stained glass windows bearing the names and emblems of insurance companies that subscribed to the CII, and finished internally with wood panelling. The building initially contained a 480-seat conference hall, a council chamber, a library, a museum, a common-room and writing room for members, 4 classrooms and offices occupied by the CII staff, the Insurance Institute of London, the Life Office's Association, the Insurance Charities and the Insurance Official's Society.\n\nThe Insurance Hall was one of few buildings in the area left standing after the bombardment of 29th-30th December 1940, in part due to the efforts of the house steward, Gordon Edward Stewart, who remained in the building to put out fires during the raid. Following the raid, the CII hosted the events of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries and the Institute of Actuaries as their halls had been destroyed.\n\nIn 1964 the adjoining land at 21 Aldermanbury was developed into a 5-storey extension to the Insurance Hall to provide more office space for the CII. In 1986, after a period of refurbishment that redeveloped the conference hall and lower ground floor into a banqueting suite, the Insurance Hall was reopened by the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Chartered Insurance Institute was granted on 25 September 1933. It is composed of a blue shield displaying symbols representing the four original classes of insurance:\n\n\nThe coat of arms was installed on the façade of the Insurance Hall on its opening in 1934. It was subsequently matriculated in Scotland. Two Scottish Local Institutes obtained the grant of differenced versions, incorporating a castle in Edinburgh and a lamb in Perth.\n\nThe full display of heraldic attributes, known as achievement, was granted in 1957 to mark the CII's Diamond Jubilee. The additional elements are:\n\nA representation of the full achievement of armorial bearings was installed on the rear façade of the building.\n\nAt the time that the Institute was granted a Royal Charter in 1912, full membership was only open to \"men working in insurance.\" Following the First World War, in 1919, the ban on women sitting exams was lifted. A year later, 25 women entered the Institute. In 1921, the first woman achieved Fellowship. An equal membership fee was introduced in 1966. Until then, apart from diploma holders, women had to pay only a nominal fee to join the \"Lady Members Committee\". The same year, an alternative cheaper 'lady social membership' was also offered by some local institutes, which was purely for organising and participating in social events.\n\nBy comparison, today membership of the CII is open to anyone connected with insurance or financial services, including students intending to join the profession.\n\nAs of September 2018, the CII has over 120,000 members across 150 countries. Over 10% of members are based outside of the UK.\n\nThere are eight levels of membership:\n\n\nEvery CII member in the UK, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man is automatically a member of one of 58 local institutes. There are an additional seven associated institutes in Gibraltar and the Republic of Ireland. Members outside of the UK have the option of membership in one of 70 affiliated global insurance institutes.\n\nA strong desire to form a central Insurance Library in London existed before the Charter incorporation in 1912. The objectives of the then Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland included ‘to encourage the study of all subjects bearing on every branch of insurance, and to form a Library for the use of members’. These objectives were then written into the 1912 Charter as the obligation for the CII to maintain a library of resources related to insurance for the benefit of its members. However, it was not until the opening of the Insurance Hall in 1934 that the Chartered Insurance Institute Library was established. Prior to that date, federated Insurance Institutes maintained insurance libraries across the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe CII Library was initially run in conjunction with the Insurance Institute of London library. The original intention was to run both libraries side by side, the London Insurance Institute Library as a lending library for members of that institute and the Chartered Insurance Institute Library as a reference library for all members. Both libraries eventually merged into one single Library that now acts as a central lending library and knowledge service for all members.\n\nThe Museum has existed since the opening of the Insurance Hall in 1934. It currently occupies a small space on the second floor. It is dedicated to the history of the four main classes of insurance, with a special focus on fire insurance and the history of fire fighting. Early insurance policies and other artefacts from the Chartered Insurance Institute's special collections are on display. The Museum originally exhibited a 19th-century fire brigade engine which is now housed at the American Museum in Bath.\n\nIn 1934 the illustrator C. Walter Hodges painted a frieze that surrounds the four walls of the museum area, depicting allegories of marine, fire, accident and life insurance. The Insurance Hall is designated as a Grade II listed building, in part due to these murals.\n\nThe CII also exhibits a large collection of over 1,500 fire marks which were bequeathed to the CII by several different donors.\n\n"}
{"id": "2052697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052697", "title": "Anarchism without adjectives", "text": "Anarchism without adjectives\n\nAnarchism without adjectives (from the Spanish \"\"), in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, \"referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, [...] [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools\".\n\nIn the 1920s, synthesis anarchism emerged as a form of anarchist organizations based on anarchism-without-adjectives principles. \n\nThe originators of the expression were Cuban-born Fernando Tarrida del Mármol and Ricardo Mella, who were troubled by the bitter debates between mutualist, individualist and communist anarchists in the 1880s. Their use of the phrase \"anarchism without adjectives\" was an attempt to show greater tolerance between anarchist tendencies and to be clear that anarchists should not impose a preconceived economic plan on anyone—even in theory. Anarchists without adjectives tended either to reject all particular anarchist economic models as faulty, or take a pluralist position of embracing them all to a limited degree in order that they may keep one another in check. Regardless, to these anarchists the economic preferences are considered to be of \"secondary importance\" to abolishing all coercive authority, with free experimentation the one rule of a free society.\n\nThe theoretical perspective known as \"anarquismo sin adjetivos\" was one of the by-products of an intense debate within the movement of anarchism itself. The roots of the argument can be found in the development of anarcho-communism after Mikhail Bakunin's death in 1876. While not entirely dissimilar to collectivist anarchism (as can be seen from James Guillaume's famous work \"On Building the New Social Order\" within Bakunin on anarchism, the collectivists did see their economic system evolving into free communism), communist anarchists developed, deepened and enriched Bakunin's work just as Bakunin had developed, deepened and enriched PIerre-Joseph Proudhon's. Communist anarchism was associated with such anarchists as Élisée Reclus, Carlo Cafiero, Errico Malatesta and (most famously) Peter Kropotkin.\n\nAnarcho-communist ideas replaced collectivist anarchism as the main anarchist tendency in Europe, except in Spain. Here the major issue was not the question of communism (although for Ricardo Mella this played a part), but a question of the modification of strategy and tactics implied by communist anarchism. At this time (the 1880s), the anarcho-communists stressed local cells of anarchist militants, generally opposed trade unionism as were characterized by a degree of anti-organisation. Unsurprisingly, such a change in strategy and tactics came in for a lot of discussion from the Spanish collectivists who strongly supported working class organisation and struggle.\n\nThis debate soon spread outside of Spain and the discussion found its way into the pages of \"La Revolte\" in Paris. This provoked many anarchists to agree with Malatesta's argument that \"[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses\". Over time, most anarchists agreed (to use Max Nettlau's words) that \"we cannot foresee the economic development of the future\" and so started to stress what they had in common, rather than the different visions of how a free society would operate. As time progressed, most anarcho-communists saw that ignoring the labour movement ensured that their ideas did not reach the working class while most anarcho-communists stressed their commitment to communist ideals and their arrival sooner, rather than later, after a revolution.\n\nSimilarly, in the United States there was an intense debate at the same time between individualist and communist anarchists. There, Benjamin Tucker was arguing that anarcho-communists were not anarchists while Johann Most was similarly dismissing Tucker's ideas. Troubled by the \"bitter debates\" between anarchists from divergent schools of economic thought, those who did not see a need to confine themselves to one particular school of thought called for more tolerance among anarchists, with some of them explicitly terming it \"anarchism without adjectives\".\n\nFor example, early feminist Voltairine de Cleyre labelled herself as simply \"anarchist\" and called on others to adopt an \"anarchism without adjectives\" until enough experimental examples were tried in different localities to determine its most appropriate form. De Cleyre sought conciliation between the various schools and said in her essay \"Anarchism\":There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [these systems] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to. (When I say 'do not agree to' I do not mean that they have a mere distaste for...I mean serious differences which in their opinion threaten their essential liberties...)...Therefore I say that each group of persons acting socially in freedom may choose any of the proposed systems, and be just as thorough-going Anarchists as those who select another.Historically, anarchists who embraced \"anarchism without adjectives\" objected to capitalism from the original use of the term as a call for tolerance amongst collectivist and communist anarchists, all of whom rejected capitalism. Voltairine de Cleyre was also of this bent and when commenting on the McKinley assassination wrote: \"The hells of capitalism create the desperate; the desperate act - desperately!\". In lamenting the present difficulty in abolishing private property, Malatesta wrote that \"[...] this does not prevent us now, or will it in the future, from continually opposing capitalism or any other form of despotism\".\n\nSynthesis anarchism is a form of anarchist organization which tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. Volin was a prolific Russian writer and anarchist intellectual who played an important part in the organization and leadership of the Nabat Confederation of Anarchist Organizations, an anarchist organization that came to prominence in Ukraine during the years 1918 to 1920. Volin was charged with writing a platform that could be agreeable to all the major branches of anarchism, most importantly anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-collectivism/communism and anarcho-individualism. The uniform platform for Nabat was never truly decided upon, but Volin used what he had written and the inspiration from Nabat to create his anarchist synthesis for which he became famous among anarchists.\n\nThe discussion about the anarchist synthesis arises in the context of the discussion on the Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists, written by the Dielo Truda group of Russian exiles in 1926. The \"Platform\" attracted strong criticism from many sectors on the anarchist movement of the time including some of the most influential anarchists such as Voline, Errico Malatesta, Luigi Fabbri, Camillo Berneri, Max Nettlau, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman and Gregori Maximoff. Voline along with Mollie Steimer, Senya Fleshin and others wrote a reply, stating \"to maintain that anarchism is only a theory of classes is to limit it to a single viewpoint. Anarchism is more complex and pluralistic, like life itself. Its class element is above all its means of fighting for liberation; its humanitarian character is its ethical aspect, the foundation of society; its individualism is the goal of mankind\".\nTwo texts made as responses to the \"Platform\", each proposing a different organizational model, became the basis for what is known as the organisation of synthesis, or simply \"synthesism\". Voline published in 1924 a paper calling for \"the anarchist synthesis\" and was also the author of the article in Sébastien Faure's \"Encyclopedie Anarchiste\" on the same topic. The main purpose behind the synthesis was that the anarchist movement in most countries was divided into three main tendencies: communist anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism and individualist anarchism and so such an organization could contain anarchists of this three tendencies very well. In his text The \"Anarchist Synthesis\", Faure has the view that \"these currents were not contradictory but complementary, each having a role within anarchism: anarcho-syndicalism as the strength of the mass organisations and the best way for the practice of anarchism; libertarian communism as a proposed future society based on the distribution of the fruits of labour according to the needs of each one; and anarcho-individualism as a negation of oppression and affirming the individual right to development of the individual, seeking to please them in every way.\n\nThe International of Anarchist Federations (IAF/IFA) was founded during an international anarchist conference in Carrara in 1968 by the three existing European anarchist federations of France, Italy and Spain as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. These organizations were also inspired on synthesist principles.\n\nAnarchism without adjectives tends to imply as far as economics a coexistence of economic models from mutualism/individualist anarchism, Bakuninist collectivism and anarcho-communism. German anarchist without adjectives Max Nettlau addressed the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems as follows:\n\nFrench individualist anarchist Émile Armand argued for a pluralistic economic logic when he said: \"Here and there everything happening—here everyone receiving what they need, there each one getting whatever is needed according to their own capacity. Here, gift and barter—one product for another; there, exchange—product for representative value. Here, the producer is the owner of the product, there, the product is put to the possession of the collectivity.\"\n\nAt the time of the Spanish Revolution led by the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT and by the FAI, the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems was addressed. In \"Anarchism: From Theory to Practice\", Daniel Guérin reports:\n\nFred Woodworth describes his anarchism as being without adjectives, saying: \"I have no prefix or adjective for my anarchism. I think syndicalism can work, as can free-market anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-communism, even anarcho-hermits, depending on the situation\".\n"}

{"id": "2052705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052705", "title": "Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II", "text": "Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n\nThe Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II marked the 25th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the thrones of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. It was celebrated with large-scale parties and parades throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth throughout 1977, culminating in June with the official \"Jubilee Days\", held to coincide with the Queen's Official Birthday. The anniversary date itself was commemorated in church services across the land on 6 February 1977, and continued throughout the month. In March, preparations started for large parties in every major city of the United Kingdom, as well as for smaller ones for countless individual streets throughout the country.\n\nNo monarch before Queen Elizabeth II had visited more of the United Kingdom in such a short span of time (the trips lasted three months). All in all, the Queen and her husband Prince Philip visited a total of 36 counties. The trip started with record crowds gathering to see the Queen and Prince Philip in Glasgow, Scotland, on 17 May. After moving to England (where a record one million spectators came to greet the couple in Lancashire) and Wales, the Queen and Prince Philip wrapped up the first of their trips with a visit to Northern Ireland. Among the places visited during the national trips were numerous schools, which were the subject of a television special hosted by presenter Valerie Singleton.\n\nLater in the summer, the Queen and Prince Philip embarked on a Commonwealth visit that first brought them to island nations such as Fiji and Tonga, following up with longer stints in New Zealand and Australia, with a final stop in Papua New Guinea before going on to the British holdings in the West Indies. The final stop on the international tour was a trip to Canada, in which Prince Charles joined the couple to greet the crowds.\n\nOn 6 June, the Queen lit a bonfire beacon at Windsor Castle, the light of which spread across the night in a chain of other beacons throughout the whole country. On 7 June, crowds lined the route of the procession to St Paul's Cathedral, where the royal family attended a Service of Thanksgiving alongside many world leaders, including United States President Jimmy Carter, and Prime Minister James Callaghan as well as all of the living former Prime Ministers (Harold Macmillan, The Lord Home of the Hirsel, Sir Harold Wilson and Edward Heath). The service was followed by lunch in the Guildhall, hosted by the Lord Mayor of the City of London Peter Vanneck. At the reception, the Queen was quoted as saying:\n\nAfter the luncheon, the procession continued down The Mall to Buckingham Palace, where an estimated one million people lined the pavements to see the family wave to onlookers. A further 500 million people around the Commonwealth watched the day's events on live television. On 7 June, streets and villages threw elaborate parties for all their residents, and many streets strung bunting (the little flags were usually modelled in pattern after the Union Flag) from rooftop to rooftop across the street. In addition to parties, many streets decorated motor vehicles as historical events from Britain's past, and drove them about town, organising their very own parades. In London alone there were over 4000 organised parties for individual streets and neighbourhoods. Throughout the entire day, onlookers were greeted by the Queen many times as she made several appearances for pictures from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nOn 9 June, the Queen made a Royal Progress trip via boat up the River Thames from Greenwich to Lambeth, in a re-enactment of the famous progresses taken by Queen Elizabeth I. On the trip, the Queen officially opened the Silver Jubilee Walkway and the South Bank Jubilee Gardens, two of numerous places named after the festivities. In the evening, she presided over a fireworks display and was taken subsequently by a procession of lighted carriages to Buckingham Palace, where she greeted onlookers yet again from her balcony.\n\nBefore, during, and after the events of Jubilee, the event was addressed in many media of popular culture throughout the Commonwealth.\n\nOn 7 June, Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren and the record label Virgin arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Vivienne Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.\n\nWith the official UK record chart for Jubilee week about to be released, the \"Daily Mirror\" predicted that \"God Save the Queen\" by the British punk rock band the Sex Pistols would be number one. As it turned out, the controversial record placed second, behind a Rod Stewart single in its fourth week at the top. Many believed that the record had actually qualified for the top spot, but that the chart had been rigged to prevent a spectacle. McLaren later claimed that CBS Records, which was distributing both singles, told him that the Sex Pistols were actually outselling Stewart two to one. There is evidence that an exceptional directive was issued by the British Phonographic Institute, which oversaw the chart-compiling bureau, to exclude sales from record-company operated shops such as Virgin's for that week only.\n\nOn 6 and 7 June, Queen finished their A Day at the Races Tour by playing two concerts at Earls Court, London to commemorate the Jubilee. The concerts also saw the band use a lighting rig in the shape of a crown for the first time.\n\nThe soap opera \"Coronation Street\" wrote an elaborate Jubilee parade into the storyline, having Rovers' Return Inn manager Annie Walker dress up in elaborate costume as Elizabeth I. Ken Barlow and \"Uncle Albert\" played Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing respectively. The Jubilee also figured into the time-travel storyline of a 1983 \"Doctor Who\" story, \"Mawdryn Undead\".\n\nVarious places were named after the Jubilee. The under-construction \"Fleet line\" of the London Underground was renamed the Jubilee line, and given a silver line colour, though it did not open until 1979. Other places named after the Jubilee were the Silver Jubilee Walkway and the Jubilee Gardens in South Bank, London. The Silver Jubilee Bridge – connecting Runcorn and Widnes across the Mersey – was also renamed in honour of this jubilee.\n\nApart from names, the Jubilee also saw the borough of Derby granted the status of a city. Australian artist, Paul Fitzgerald, was commissioned to complete the only official portrait of the Queen during the Silver Jubilee year. Similar parties and parades were planned for the Golden Jubilee in 2002.\n\nFor the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012, a by print of a photograph of the British Royal Family taken during her Silver Jubilee celebrations at Buckingham Palace was erected in front of the Sea Containers House under renovation.\n\nA round silver pendant, designed by the then newly-retired English rower, John Pinches, was issued by Franklin Mint in 1977 to commemorate the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee. The double-sided oval pendant has a distinctive design incorporating the four emblems of the countries of the United Kingdom: the Tudor rose for England, daffodils for Wales, thistles for Scotland and shamrocks for Northern Ireland.\n\nAround the edges of the pendant can be seen Silver Jubilee 1977, (C) JP 77 P and a full hallmark: JP (maker's mark for John Pinches), 925, London Assay Office mark for imported silver, date stamp C (for year 1977) and queen's head (for silver jubilee year).\n\n\n"}

The structures were used during the New Kingdom, in the first four years of the 18th dynasty reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, when he still used the name \"Amenhotep IV\". The edifices may have been constructed at the end of the reign of his father, Amenhotep III, and completed by Akhenaten.\n\nThe Temple of Amenhotep IV was constructed outside the boundaries of the Precinct of Amon-Re, to its east. The main temple in the complex was named \"Gm–p3–itn\" (Gempaaten), which means \"The Sun Disc is Found in the Estate of the God Aten\". The other monuments were named \"Hwt–bnbn\" (Hwt benben / \"The Mansion of the Benben stone\"), \"Rwd–mnw–n–itn–r–nḥḥ\" (Rud-menu / \"Sturdy are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever\"), and \"Tni–mnw–n–itn–r–nḥḥ\" (Teni–menu / \"Exalted are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever\").\n\nVery little of these buildings remain; they were built quickly, using Talatat blocks, and could therefore easily be demolished and reused as core for later structures.\n\nThe \"Gempaaten\" appears to have had no roof and its offering tables were exposed to direct sunlight. In this building (or associated with it) were red granite and sandstone statues of Akhenaten, red granite offering tables and other statues, including a sphinx inscribed with the name of the deity Aten. It was of a considerable size (130m x 216m), but it was so completely destroyed that even its foundations have been nearly obliterated.\n\nIt stood within a mud-brick enclosure, and was orientated to the east, possibly with an entrance to the west. It led to an open court surrounded by square pillars and colossal statues of Akhenaten and Nefertiti.\n\nErected to the east, the \"Hwt benben\" or Mansion of the Benben was devoted to a solar cult and was closely associated with the Gempaaten.\n\nThe Teni–menu seemed to contain domestic and storage rooms, and may have been a royal residence, although not enough of the structure remains to clarify the use.\n\nThe walls of the Teni-menu were reused in the Ninth Pylon of the main Karnak temple. They have since been identified and reassembled like a giant puzzle and are partly exhibited in the Luxor Museum. The reassembled walls show residential, administrative and royal scenes and solar Jubilee scenes of the first Sed festival, which Akhenaten was probably celebrating at the same time as his father Amenhotep III.\n\n"}

The track is based on a clay sand mix, is oval shaped and is in length.\n\nThe track opened in 1976 thanks to the efforts of brothers Doug and Norm Drew, drivers from the area who like others needed a venue to race at after the closure of Torquay Speedway. Early on the big attraction to the new Speedway were the bikes with such Solo riders as World Champions Ole Olsen, Ivan Mauger and Barry Briggs battling Australian riders such as Victorian favourite Phil Crump. Sidecars were also a big draw and the Speedway hosted the 1980 Australian Sidecar Championship as well as numerous Victorian Sidecar title meetings.\n\nThe introduction of clay to the track surface in the early 1990s saw bike racing off the program at Avalon Raceway. Sprint car racing had been the biggest draw in Australian speedway since the late 1970s and the clay surface suited this type of oval track racing. Since this time Avalon has been a regular of the World Series Sprintcars and was also the home of the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix from 2003 until 2010. The WSS date is often an international affair, as the event occurs days after Christmas Day and United States-based drivers often participate during their off-season. NASCAR stars Christopher Bell and Kyle Larson, World of Outlaws star Brad Sweet, and Knoxville Nationals winner Jason Johnson have participated in sprint car races at this circuit during their off-season. \n\nThe outright lap record is held by South Australian driver Steven Lines from Mount Gambier, with a time of 10.930 seconds, set on 12 November 2011, in a 410 Sprintcar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052710", "title": "Silpheed", "text": "Silpheed\n\n\"Silpheed\" is the name of the spacecraft that the player controls, and is most likely derived from the famous ballet, \"La Sylphide\". Like many shooter games, the story involves using the Silpheed as Earth's last effort to save itself from destruction by a powerful enemy invasion. The original 1986 PC-88 version used 3D polygonal graphics on top of a tilted third-person backdrop. The 1993 Sega CD version later used pre-rendered computer animation as a full motion video background, a technique previously used by the Namco System 21 arcade game \"Galaxian 3\" and later the Sega CD version of \"Starblade\".\n\n\"Silpheed\" is a vertical-scrolling shooter video game. It is presented at an oblique view camera angle, with enemies and other objects becoming smaller as they move towards the top of the screen. The player assumes the role of a starship named the SA-08 Silpheed, deployed by the Yggdrassil supercomputer to destroy the Xacalite terrorist organization. The Silpheed can freely move about the screen. In each level, the player is tasked with destroying various enemies while avoiding their projectiles. By shooting down red-colored orbs found throughout levels, the player can acquire one of five different weapon types, each with their own unique behavior and strengths; these include homing missiles, an auto-aiming shot, and a \"phanlax\" spread-shot laser. Weapons can be attached to either side of the Silpheed.\n\nThe original Silpheed game was created for the PC-8801, and released on December 5, 1986. Another version for the FM-7 was released on March 3, 1988. In the same year, the game was brought to the United States for the first time by Sierra On-Line who ported the game to DOS and other platforms.\n\nThe storyline is that in the future (no date is specified, though 3032 is referred to as the date when an alien ship was discovered that led to rapid technological advancement and allowed humans to colonize outer space) a terrorist named Xacalite has stolen \"planetary buster\" missiles and a battleship named Gloire and the fleet is not close enough to Earth to get there before Xacalite destroys it, so the supercomputer Yggdrassil orders the experimental SA-08 Silpheed fighter to be used to destroy Gloire.\n\nThe Sega CD port of \"Silpheed\" places polygon ships over a pre-rendered video background; this method is also seen in other video game titles, such as Namco's \"Galaxian 3\" in 1990 and \"StarBlade\" in 1991, Sony Imagesoft's \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" in 1992, and Micronet's \"A/X-101\" in 1994 for the Sega CD.\n\nThe game's story concerns a space war campaign when terrorists—led by a man named Xacalite—hack into the mother computer of Earth, granting them control over all the space weaponry of the solar system. The Earth's only hope is a small fleet outside the computer's reach, provided with a squadron of SA-77 Silpheed dogfighters (referred to as \"prototypes\" in the manual for the PC version). In the ending credits sequence of this version there are cinematic animations of scenes depicting the fighters flying through stages in the game.\n\nIn 1989, \"Dragon\" gave the DOS version of the game 5 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"\"Silpheed\" is highly addictive, extremely colorful, and requires hours of enjoyable practice to master.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the same version a positive review, praising the original music for the game. The British gaming magazine \"ACE\" gave the game a score of 905 out of 1000. \"Compute!\" called \"Silpheed\" \"classic arcade fun with a little more depth than you'll find in many action-oriented games\", but criticized the simple sound effects.\n\nThe four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Sega CD version scores of 9, 7, 7 and 7 out of 10. They said it is a \"rather mundane\" and \"simple shooter\" but the \"game play is solid\" and the backgrounds are \"some of the most stunning visuals in a video game.\" However, they criticized the unimpressive bosses, mediocre powerups and especially the lack of interaction with the backgrounds as the game's biggest problems.\n\n\"Mega\" placed the game at #5 in their Top Mega-CD Games of All Time, \"MegaTech\" magazine said the game was \"undoubtedly one of the best games yet for the Mega-CD\". This version of the game was a bestseller in Japan.\n\nA Sega CD prototype version of the game was showcased at the Winter CES in January 1993, with a great deal less enemies for gameplay demonstration.\n\nA sequel was released, \"\", for the PlayStation 2 in 2000. It was developed by Game Arts alongside Treasure.\n\nA space combat simulator game was released by Square Enix in 2006 for the Xbox 360 titled \"Project Sylpheed\". It is not directly tied into the \"Silpheed\" storyline, but was instead billed as a spiritual successor.\n\nIn 2012, an app for Android, called \"Silpheed Alternative: Menace from beyond the stars\" was made, also considered as a spiritual successor.

{"id": "2052726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052726", "title": "Wafer-scale integration", "text": "Wafer-scale integration\n\nWafer-scale integration, WSI for short, is a rarely used system of building very-large integrated circuit networks that use an entire silicon wafer to produce a single \"super-chip\". Combining large size and reduced packaging, WSI was expected to lead to dramatically reduced costs for some systems, notably massively parallel supercomputers. The name is taken from the term very-large-scale integration, the current state of the art when WSI was being developed.\n\nTo understand WSI, one has to consider the normal chip-making process. A single large cylindrical crystal of silicon is produced and then cut into disks known as wafers. The wafers are then cleaned and polished in preparation for the fabrication process. A photographic process is used to pattern the surface where material ought to be deposited on top of the wafer and where not to. The desired material is deposited and the photographic mask is removed for the next layer. From then on the wafer is repeatedly processed in this fashion, putting on layer after layer of circuitry on the surface.\n\nMultiple copies of these patterns are deposited on the wafer in a grid fashion across the surface of the wafer. After all the possible locations are patterned, the wafer surface appears like a sheet of graph paper, with grid lines delineating the individual chips. Each of these grid locations is tested for manufacturing defects by automated equipment. Those locations that are found to be defective are recorded and marked with a dot of paint (this process is referred to as \"inking a die\" however modern wafer fabrication no longer requires physical markings to identify defective die). The wafer is then sawed apart to cut out the individual chips. Those defective chips are thrown away, or recycled, while the working chips are placed into packaging and re-tested for any damage that might occur during the packaging process.\n\nFlaws on the surface of the wafers and problems during the layering/depositing process are impossible to avoid, and cause some of the individual chips to be defective. The revenue from the remaining working chips has to pay for the entire cost of the wafer and its processing, including those discarded defective chips. Thus, the higher number of working chips or higher \"yield\", the lower the cost of each individual chip. In order to maximize yield one wants to make the chips as small as possible, so that a higher number of working chips can be obtained per wafer.\n\nThe vast majority of the cost of fabrication (typically 30%-50%) is related to testing and packaging the individual chips. Further cost is associated with connecting the chips into an integrated system (usually via a printed circuit board). Wafer-scale integration seeks to reduce this cost, as well as improve performance, by building larger chips in a single package – in principle, chips as large as a full wafer.\n\nOf course this is not easy, since given the flaws on the wafers a single large design printed onto a wafer would almost always not work. It has been an ongoing goal to develop methods to handle faulty areas of the wafers through logic, as opposed to sawing them out of the wafer. Generally, this approach uses a grid pattern of sub-circuits and \"rewires\" around the damaged areas using appropriate logic. If the resulting wafer has enough working sub-circuits, it can be used despite faults.\n\nMany companies attempted to develop WSI production systems in the 1970s and 80s, but all failed. TI and ITT both saw it as a way to develop complex pipelined microprocessors and re-enter a market where they were losing ground, but neither released any products.\n\nGene Amdahl also attempted to develop WSI as a method of making a supercomputer, starting Trilogy Systems in 1980 and garnering investments from Groupe Bull, Sperry Rand and Digital Equipment Corporation, who (along with others) provided an estimated $230 million in financing. The design called for a 2.5\" square chip with 1200 pins on the bottom.\n\nThe effort was plagued by a series of disasters, including floods which delayed the construction of the plant and later ruined the clean-room interior. After burning through about 1/3 of the capital with nothing to show for it, Amdahl eventually declared the idea would only work with a 99.99% yield, which wouldn't happen for 100 years. He used Trilogy's remaining seed capital to buy Elxsi, a maker of VAX-compatible computers, in 1985. The Trilogy efforts were eventually ended and \"became\" Elxsi.\nOn August 19, 2019, a startup called Cerebras Systems presented their development progress of WSI for deep learning acceleration. Their TSMC 16nm wafer scale chip is 46,225mm (215mm x 215mm), which is 56x larger than the largest GPU today. It features 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 AI cores, 18GB of on-chip SRAM and 100Pbit/s fabric bandwidth. The price and clock rate have not been disclosed yet.\n\nMost yield loss in chipmaking comes from defects in the transistor layers or in the high-density lower metal layers.\nAnother approach -- silicon-interconnect fabric (Si-IF) -- has neither on the wafer. Si-IF puts only relatively low-density metal layers on the wafer, roughly the same density as the upper layers of a system on a chip, using the wafer only for interconnects between tightly-packed small bare chiplets.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Westminster School and continued at the Dutch University of Leyden for additional studies. He read law at the Middle Temple and became ordained in the Church of England. He later undertook further studies at Wadham College, Oxford.\n\nPeters married a servant girl of Westminster. They later separated.\n\nIn 1734, believing that his first wife was dead, Peters remarried. A bigamy scandal arose when his first wife reappeared. The following year, he emigrated from Liverpool to exile in the colonies, settling in Philadelphia. His brother William Peters also immigrated to Philadelphia.\n\nPeters became an assistant at Christ Church in Philadelphia, the major city of the Pennsylvania colony, and served there for two years. He directly worked for the Penn proprietary family as Secretary of the Land Office, Secretary of the Province and Clerk of the Council. He held these positions for a quarter of a century, and in 1749 was also appointed to the Governor's Council, serving until the Revolution.\n\nIn 1754, Peters was among several men appointed to the Pennsylvania delegation for the Albany Congress, a meeting in Albany, New York of more than 20 colonial representatives to discuss plans for defense in the face of French threat in the Seven Years' War, which front in North America was known as the French and Indian War. He recommended adoption of Benjamin Franklin's Albany Plan, an early proposal to create a unified colonial government. It was rejected by colonial assemblies and the British Board of Trade alike.\n\nIn 1762 Peters retired from the proprietary offices to his \"Belmont\" estate, as he made a sufficient fortune. He was called as rector of Christ Church, and served until his health forced him to resign in September 1775.

An operating system may provide abstractions for accessing different file systems transparently.\n\nSome file system APIs may also include interfaces for maintenance operations, such as creating or initializing a file system, verifying the file system for integrity, and defragmentation.\n\nEach operating system includes the APIs needed for the file systems it supports. Microsoft Windows has file system APIs for NTFS and several FAT file systems. Linux systems can include APIs for ext2, ext3, ReiserFS, and Btrfs to name a few.\n\nSome early operating systems were capable of handling only tape and disk file systems. These provided the most basic of interfaces with:\n\nMore coordination such as device allocation and deallocation required the addition of:\n\nAs file systems provided more services, more interfaces were defined:\n\nAs additional file system types, hierarchy structure and supported media increased, additional features needed some specialized functions:\n\nMulti-user systems required APIs for:\n\nWriting user data to a file system is provided for use directly by the user program or the run-time library. The run-time library for some programming languages may provide type conversion, formatting and blocking. Some file systems provide identification of records by key and may include re-writing an existing record. This operation is sometimes called or codice_1 (if the record exists)\n\nReading user data, sometimes called GET, may include a direction (forward or reverse) or in the case of a keyed file system, a specific key. As with writing run-time libraries may intercede for the user program.\n\nPositioning includes adjusting the location of the next record. This may include skipping forward or reverse as well as positioning to the beginning or end of the file.\n\nThe open API may be explicitly requested or implicitly invoked upon the issuance of the first operation by a process on an object. It may cause the mounting of removable media, establishing a connection to another host and validating the location and accessibility of the object. It updates system structures to indicate that the object is in use.\n\nUsual requirements for requesting access to a file system object include:\nAdditional information may be necessary, for example\nThese are requested via a programming language library which may provide coordination among modules in the process in addition to forwarding the request to the file system.\n\nIt must be expected that something may go wrong during the processing of the open. \n\nDepending on the programming language, additional specifications in the open may establish the modules to handle these conditions. Some libraries specify a library module to the file system permitting analysis should the opening program be unable to perform any meaningful action as a result of a failure. For example, if the failure is on the attempt to open the necessary input file, the only action may be to report the failure and abort the program. Some languages simply return a code indicating the type of failure which always must be checked by the program, which decides what to report and if it can continue. \nClose may cause dismounting or ejecting removable media and updating library and file system structures to indicate that the object is no longer in use. \nThe minimal specification to the close references the object. Additionally, some file systems provide specifying a disposition of the object which may indicate the object is to be discarded and no longer be part of the file system.\nSimilar to the open, it must be expected that something may go wrong.\n\nConsiderations for handling a failure are similar to those of the open.\n\nInformation about the data in a file is called metadata.\n\nSome of the metadata is maintained by the file system, for example last-modification date (and various other dates depending on the file system), \nlocation of the beginning of the file, the size of the file and if the file system backup utility has saved the current version of the files. These items cannot usually be altered by a user program.\n\nAdditional meta data supported by some file systems may include the owner of the file, the group to which the file belongs as well as permissions and/or access control (i.e. What access and updates various users or groups may perform), and whether the file is normally visible when the directory is listed. These items are usually modifiable by file system utilities which may be executed by the owner.\n\nSome applications store more metadata. For images the metadata may include the camera model and settings used to take the photo. For audio files, the meta data may include the album, artist who recorded the recording and comments about the recording which may be specific to a particular copy of the file (i.e. different copies of the same recording may have different comments as update by the owner of the file). Documents may include items like checked-by, approved-by, etc.\n\nRenaming a file, moving a file (or a subdirectory) from one directory to another and deleting a file are examples of the operations provide by the file system for the management of directories.\n\nMetadata operations such as permitting or restricting access the a directory by various users or groups of users are usually included.\n\nAs a filesystem is used directories, files and records may be added, deleted or modified. This usually causes inefficiencies in the underlying data structures. Things like logically sequential blocks distributed across the media in a way that causes excessive repositioning, partially used even empty blocks included in linked structures. Incomplete structures or other inconsistencies may be caused by device or media errors, inadequate time between detection of impending loss of power and actual power loss, improper system shutdown or media removal, and on very rare occasions file system coding errors.\n\nSpecialized routines in the file system are included to optimize or repair these structures. They are not usually invoked by the user directly but triggered within the file system itself. Internal counters of the number of levels of structures, number of inserted objects may be compared against thresholds. These may cause user access to be suspended to a specific structure (usually to the displeasure of the user or users effected) or may be started as low priority asynchronous tasks or they may be deferred to a time of low user activity. Sometimes these routines are invoked or scheduled by the system manager or as in the case of defragmentation.\n\nThe API is \"kernel-level\" when the kernel not only provides the interfaces for the filesystems developers but is also the space in which the filesystem code resides.\n\nIt differs with the old schema in that the kernel itself uses its own facilities to talk with the filesystem driver and vice versa, as contrary to the kernel being the one that handles the filesystem layout and the filesystem the one that directly access the hardware.\n\nIt is not the cleanest scheme but resolves the difficulties of major rewrite that has the old scheme.\n\nWith modular kernels it allows adding filesystems as any kernel module, even third party ones. With non-modular kernels however it requires the kernel to be recompiled with the new filesystem code (and in closed-source kernels, this makes third party filesystem impossible).\n\nUnixes and Unix-like systems such as Linux have used this modular scheme.\n\nThere is a variation of this scheme used in MS-DOS (DOS 4.0 onward) and compatibles to support CD-ROM and network file systems. Instead of adding code to the kernel, as in the old scheme, or using kernel facilities as in the kernel-based scheme, it traps all calls to a file and identifies if it should be redirected to the kernel's equivalent function or if it has to be handled by the specific filesystem driver, and the filesystem driver \"directly\" access the disk contents using low-level BIOS functions.\n\nThe API is \"driver-based\" when the kernel provides facilities but the file system code resides totally external to the kernel (not even as a module of a modular kernel).\n\nIt is a cleaner scheme as the filesystem code is totally independent, it allows filesystems to be created for closed-source kernels and online filesystem additions or removals from the system.\n\nExamples of this scheme are the Windows NT and OS/2 respective IFSs.\n\nIn this API all filesystems are in the kernel, like in kernel-based APIs, but they are automatically trapped by another API, that is driver-based, by the OS.\n\nThis scheme was used in Windows 3.1 for providing a FAT filesystem driver in 32-bit protected mode, and cached, (VFAT) that bypassed the DOS FAT driver in the kernel (MSDOS.SYS) completely, and later in the Windows 9x series (95, 98 and Me) for VFAT, the ISO9660 filesystem driver (along with Joliet), network shares, and third party filesystem drivers, as well as adding to the original DOS APIs the LFN API (that IFS drivers can not only intercept the already existent DOS file APIs but also add new ones from within the 32-bit protected mode executable).\n\nHowever that API was not completely documented, and third parties found themselves in a \"make-it-by-yourself\" scenario even worse than with kernel-based APIs.\n\nThe API is in the user space when the filesystem does not directly use kernel facilities but accesses disks using high-level operating system functions and provides functions in a library that a series of utilities use to access the filesystem.\n\nThis is useful for handling disk images.\n\nThe advantage is that a filesystem can be made portable between operating systems as the high-level operating system functions it uses can be as common as ANSI C, but the disadvantage is that the API is unique to each application that implements one.\n\nExamples of this scheme are the hfsutils and the adflib.\n\nAs all filesystems (at least the disk ones) need equivalent functions provided by the kernel, it is possible to easily port a filesystem code from one API to another, even if they are of different types.\n\nFor example, the ext2 driver for OS/2 is simply a wrapper from the Linux's VFS to the OS/2's IFS and the Linux's ext2 kernel-based, and the HFS driver for OS/2 is a port of the hfsutils to the OS/2's IFS. There also exists a project that uses a Windows NT IFS driver for making NTFS work under Linux.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition, he wrestled with Championship Wrestling from Florida, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, NWA All-Star Wrestling and the American Wrestling Association.\n\nRomero started wrestling in 1975 in Amarillo under a mask and calling himself \"Silver Streak\". He then moved on to Pacific Northwest Wrestling under the name of Jay Youngblood (a Native American gimmick). He wrestled in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in a regular tag team with Ricky Steamboat. Also in JCP, he was known as \"The Renegade\".\n\nIn 1982, Steamboat and Youngblood were feuding with Boris Zhukov, Don Kernodle, and their manager Sgt. Slaughter. Zhukov, then known as Private Jim Nelson, later betrayed his team in favor of Youngblood and Steamboat. The rivalry culminated in a steel cage match on March 12, 1983 in Greensboro, North Carolina that was attended by 15,000 people, where Slaughter and Kernodle lost their NWA World Tag Team Championship to Steamboat and Youngblood. In June 1982 in Maple Leaf Wrestling, Youngblood defeated The Destroyer to win the NWA Canadian Television Championship. He was later defeated by Private Jim Nelson for the title. Steamboat and Youngblood also feuded with Jack and Jerry Brisco.\n\nHe went to Championship Wrestling from Florida in September 1984 where he and Mark Youngblood captured the Florida version of the NWA United States Tag Championship.

Targets may be used with the intention of testing effectiveness of specific types of ammunition; or the target ship may be used for an extended period of routine target practice with specialized non-explosive ammunition. The potential consequences of a drifting wreck require careful preparation of the target ship to prevent pollution, or a floating or submerged collision risk for maritime navigation.\n\nSinking redundant warships is an effective way of testing new weapons and warships in as realistic a manner as possible. Whilst practice torpedoes are fired fairly frequently, they behave differently from warshots.\n\nIn order to meet environmental, health, and safety standards, ships now have to be thoroughly cleaned so that all dangerous material and potential contaminants (such as asbestos, refrigerants etc.) are removed. In the event of the vessel becoming an artificial reef, escape exits also have to be created in the vessel, should divers encounter problems. It is now also common practice to remove pennant numbers and sink the warships anonymously, as a mark of respect to those who sailed in them.\n\nIn September 1819, the French engineer and Army artillery officer Henri-Joseph Paixhans wrote to the Ministry of the Navy to propose a fusing system to fire explosive shells at wooden warships, instead of the usual, solid round shots that were then in general naval use. A commission studied the matter, and decided to build two Paixhans howitzers for trial purposes in 1822.\n\nIn 1824, the 80-gun ship of the line , made redundant by the Bourbon Restoration, was condemned. She was a two-decker of the same type as the French flagship of the Battle of Trafalgar. The two prototypes were fired at her with devastating effect. This led to the adoption of the Paixhans gun in 1827. They were used to great effect at the Battle of San Juan de Ulua, to the interest of British and US observers, who announced the demise of wooden warships and the era of the ironclad.\n\nIn 1921 former German battleship was used by the Royal Navy to test new types of shells. The tests indicated that medium-strength armour could not stop the latest armour-piercing shells, causing the British switch to an all or nothing armour scheme for their new battleships. \"Baden\" was then scuttled in Hurd Deep.\n\nThe British pre-dreadnought battleship was converted to radio-control in 1920-21 and used for assessments of the damage that could be caused by aircraft and various calibres of guns. She was replaced in the role by the battleship in 1926.\n\n\nAfter World War I ended, the US Navy and Army did live fire testing of attacking warships from the air. To get the testing as close to wartime conditions as possible, was converted into a radio-controlled target ship, the first in United States naval history. A well known radio engineer, John Hays Hammond Jr., developed the radio control gear for \"Iowa\". In 1923, \"Iowa\" was sunk off the Pacific coast of Panama during fleet exercises, with members of the United States Congress and the press attending, by the battleship . In the early 1930s the US Navy put considerable effort into the development of remote control ships and fitted the destroyer with improved radio controls developed by Lieutenant Commander Boyd R. Alexander, a radio design officer, and the Naval Research Laboratory in Bellevue D.C. for further testing and evaluation. The evaluation proved so successful that the US Navy moved up their plans for radio controlled warships and in 1932 the obsolete battleship USS \"Utah\" and the destroyers and were converted.\n\nA familiar sight for more than fifty years in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, was . This World War II Liberty ship was towed to a sandbar off shore in 1944 and was used for bombing practice through the Vietnam War.\n\nOperation Crossroads was a 1946 series of US nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll that used 95 target ships. Some were obsolete US ships, such as , others were ships surrendered by the Axis powers at the end of World War II, such as the German heavy cruiser and the Japanese battleship .\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy (RAN) sank on June 14, 1999 with a Mk48 wire guided torpedo fired from the . \"Torrens\" was the last of six Australian s, the others (\"Derwent\", \"Parramatta\", \"Stuart\", \"Swan\" and \"Yarra\") having been disposed of previously. Before the sinking \"Torrens\" had been thoroughly cleaned of all fuels, oils and potentially environmentally harmful substances. Her gun turret was donated to the South Western City of Albany. \"Torrens\" was then towed from Fleet Base West (HMAS \"Stirling\") out to sea, west of Perth. The submarine fired the torpedo at the stationary target from a submerged position over the horizon.\n\nThe sinking of \"Torrens\" was a display of firepower that provided some much needed positive publicity for the \"Collins\"-class submarines, plagued by numerous technical problems and criticised over troubles with the combat system and noise reduction. Ric Shalders, commander of the Submarine Squadron said \"the requirement of new submarine trials, the new need to test war-stock and the availability of the Torrens all came together to produce a very satisfactory result\".\n\nThe US military term Sink Exercise (SINKEX) is used for the test of a weapons system usually involving a torpedo or missile attack of an unmanned target ship. The US Navy uses SINKEX to train its sailors on the usage of modern-day weapons. \n\nThis technique is used to dispose of decommissioned warships. The US Navy performs SINKEXs north of Kauai, Hawaii, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California, and near Puerto Rico.\n\n"}

At age 39, she immigrated to Texas with her husband, Edmund Montgomery, and became a pioneer in the development of art there. Among her most famous works during her Texas period were life-size marble figures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin, commissions for the Texas State Capitol. A large group of her works are housed in the Elisabet Ney Museum, located in her home and studio in Austin. Other works can be found in the US Capitol, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and numerous collections in Germany.\n\nNey was born in Münster, in the Province of Westphalia, to Johann Adam Ney, a stonecarver and alleged nephew of Field Marshal Michel Ney, and Anna Elizabeth on January 26, 1833. The only other surviving child in the Ney family was her older brother, Fritz. Her parents were Catholics of Alsatian-Polish heritage. She was the great-niece of Michel Ney, Marshal of France. Early in life, she declared that her goal was \"\"to know great persons.\"\"\n\nNey grew up assisting her father in his work. She went on a weeks-long hunger strike when her parents opposed her becoming a sculptor, prompting her parents to request the assistance of their local bishop. Her parents finally relented and in 1852, she became the first female sculpture student at the Munich Academy of Art under professor Max von Widnmann. She received her diploma on July 29, 1854. After graduating she moved to Berlin to study under Christian Daniel Rauch. Under Rauch she studied realism and the German artistic tradition, and began sculpting her first portraits of the German elite.\n\nNey opened a studio in Berlin in 1857. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer agreed to sit for a sculpted portrait at the persuasion of Edmund Montgomery, whom she would marry in 1863. It was hailed as an artistic success and led to other commissions, most notably Jacob Grimm of the Brothers Grimm, the Italian military leader Giuseppe Garibaldi, the composer Richard Wagner, Cosima von Bülow (the daughter of Franz Liszt and Wagner's future wife), the Prussian-German political figure Otto von Bismarck, and King George V of Hanover. The latter also commissioned bust portraits of the composer Josef Joachim and his wife, the contralto Amalie Weiss Joachim. Shortly after completing the Bismarck bust, Ney was commissioned in 1868 by Prussian agents to sculpt a full-length portrait of Ludwig II of Bavaria in Munich.\n\nIn the early 1880s, Ney, by then a Texas resident, was invited to Austin by Governor Oran M. Roberts, which resulted in the resumption of her artistic career. In 1892, she built a studio named Formosa in the Hyde Park neighborhood north of Austin and began to seek commissions.\n\nIn 1891, Ney was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the Chicago World's Fair Association, and supplemented with $32,000 by the Texas state legislature, to model figures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin for the Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition World's Fair in 1893. Ney missed the deadline and the sculptures were not shown at the Exhibition. The marble sculptures of Houston and Austin can now be seen in both the Texas State Capitol in Austin and in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.. She was commissioned to sculpt a memorial to the career military officer and war hero Albert Sidney Johnston for his grave in the Texas State Cemetery. One of her signature works was the figure of Lady Macbeth; the plaster model is in the Elisabet Ney Museum and the completed marble is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum collection. She succeeded in having the orator, three-time presidential candidate, and noted attorney William Jennings Bryan sit for a portrait; she hoped to sell replicas of this bust to debate clubs across the country.\n\nHer 1903 life-size portrait bust of David Thomas Iglehart can be found at Symphony Square in Austin, where it is on permanent loan to the Austin Symphony Society. What is considered to be possible the last known work of Ney, a sculpture of a tousled haired cherub resting over a grave and known as the 1906 Schnerr Memorial, can be found at Der Stadt Friedhof in Fredericksburg, Texas.\n\nIn addition to her sculpting activities, Ney was also active in cultural affairs in Austin. Formosa become a center for cultural gatherings and curiosity seekers. The composer Paderewski and the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova were among her visitors.\n\nWhile visiting friends in Heidelberg in 1853, Ney met a young Scottish medical student, scientist, and philosopher named Edmund Montgomery. They kept in touch, and, although she viewed the institution of marriage as a state of bondage for women, after he established a medical practice in Madeira, they were married at the British consulate there on November 7, 1863.\n\nNey, however, remained outspoken about women's roles. She refused to use Montgomery's name, often denied she was even married, and once remarked:\n\nShe wore pants and rode her horses astride as men did. She liked to fashion her own clothes, which, in addition to the slacks, included boots and a black artist frock coat.\n\nMontgomery was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1863. By 1870, the Franco-Prussian War had begun. In autumn of that year, Ney became pregnant with their first child. Montgomery received a letter from his friend, Baron Carl Vicco Otto Friedrich Constantin von Stralendorff of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who had moved to Thomasville, Georgia with his new wife, Margaret Elizabeth Russell of Boston, Massachusetts, declaring the location \"Earth's paradise.\" On January 14, 1871, Ney and Montgomery, accompanied by their housekeeper, Cenci, immigrated to Georgia, to a colony promoted as a resort for consumptives. Their first son, Arthur, was born there in 1871, but died two years later (possibly of diphtheria, but the cause of death is disputed). Unfortunately, the Thomasville colony did not work out as they had hoped. Baron and Baroness von Stralendorff returned to Wismar, Germany where he died on July 1, 1872.\n\nNey and Montgomery looked elsewhere in the United States for a place to live, including Red Wing, Minnesota, where their second son, Lorne (1872–1913), was born. Later that year, Ney traveled alone to Texas. With the help of Julius Runge a businessman in Galveston, she was shown Liendo Plantation near Hempstead in Waller County. On March 4, 1873, Montgomery and the rest of the family arrived, and they purchased the plantation. While he tended to his research, she ran it for the next twenty years.\n\nNey died in her studio on June 29, 1907, and is buried next to Montgomery, who died four years later, at Liendo Plantation.\n\nUpon her death, Montgomery sold the Formosa studio to Ella Dancy Dibrell. As per her wishes, its contents were bequeathed to the University of Texas at Austin, but were to remain in the building. On April 6, 1911, Dibrell and other friends established the Texas Fine Arts Association (after more than a century in existence, the organization is now known as the Contemporary Austin) in her honor. It is the oldest Texas-wide organization existing for support of the visual arts. Formosa is now the home of the Elisabet Ney Museum. In 1941, the City of Austin took over the ownership and operation.\n\nIn 1961, Lake Jackson Primary School in Lake Jackson, Texas was renamed Elisabet Ney Elementary School in her honor.\n\nBelow is a partial listing of her works.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052772", "title": "Solenoid valve", "text": "Solenoid valve\n\nA solenoid valve is an electromechanically operated valve.\n\nSolenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the electric current they use, the strength of the magnetic field they generate, the mechanism they use to regulate the fluid, and the type and characteristics of fluid they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type actuators to pivoted-armature actuators and rocker actuators. The valve can use a two-port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold.\n\nSolenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in fluidics. Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, distribute or mix fluids. They are found in many application areas. Solenoids offer fast and safe switching, high reliability, long service life, good medium compatibility of the materials used, low control power and compact design.\n\nThere are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is open, then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is closed, then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally open (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally closed. There are also 3-way and more complicated designs. A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).\n\nSolenoid valves are also characterized by how they operate. A small solenoid can generate a limited force. If that force is sufficient to open and close the valve, then a direct acting solenoid valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required solenoid force \"F\", the fluid pressure \"P\", and the orifice area \"A\" for a direct acting solenoid valve is:\n\nWhere \"d\" is the orifice diameter. A typical solenoid force might be . An application might be a low pressure (e.g., ) gas with a small orifice diameter (e.g., for an orifice area of and approximate force of ).\nWhen high pressures and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an internally piloted solenoid valve design may be possible. In such a design, the line pressure is used to generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally piloted valves are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be and the orifice diameter might be .\n\nIn some solenoid valves the solenoid acts directly on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit referred to as a solenoid valve. Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power for a short period of time to open it, and only low power to hold it.\n\nA direct acting solenoid valve typically operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation time of a piloted valve depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.\n\nPower consumption and supply requirements of the solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4\" 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA. Comparatively, an industrial 1/2\" 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA. Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.\n\nWhile there are multiple design variants, the following is a detailed breakdown of a typical solenoid valve design.\n\nA solenoid valve has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve. The solenoid converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve has only a small flow circuit, shown within section E of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a pilot valve). In this example, a diaphragm piloted valve multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice. \n\nSolenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control. A spring may be used to hold the valve opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.\nThe diagram to the right shows the design of a basic valve, controlling the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state. The water under pressure enters at A. B is an elastic diaphragm and above it is a weak spring pushing it down. The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity C on the other side of the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.\n\nOnce the diaphragm closes the valve, the pressure on the outlet side of its bottom is reduced, and the greater pressure above holds it even more firmly closed. Thus, the spring is irrelevant to holding the valve closed.\n\nThe above all works because the small drain passage D was blocked by a pin which is the armature of the solenoid E and which is pushed down by a spring. If current is passed through the solenoid, the pin is withdrawn via magnetic force, and the water in chamber \"C\" drains out the passage \"D\" faster than the pinhole can refill it. The pressure in chamber C drops and the incoming pressure lifts the diaphragm, thus opening the main valve. Water now flows directly from A to F. \n\nWhen the solenoid is again deactivated and the passage D is closed again, the spring needs very little force to push the diaphragm down again and the main valve closes. In practice there is often no separate spring; the elastomer diaphragm is molded so that it functions as its own spring, preferring to be in the closed shape.\n\nFrom this explanation it can be seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work. Should the pressure at the output, for any reason, rise above that of the input then the valve would open regardless of the state of the solenoid and pilot valve.\n\nSolenoid valve designs have many variations and challenges.\n\nCommon components of a solenoid valve:\n\nThe core or plunger is the magnetic component that moves when the solenoid is energized. The core is coaxial with the solenoid. The core's movement will make or break the seals that control the movement of the fluid. When the coil is not energized, springs will hold the core in its normal position.\n\nThe plugnut is also coaxial.\n\nThe core tube contains and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize the movement of the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic. If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines. In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by deep drawing. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.\n\nThe solenoid coil consists of many turns of copper wire that surround the core tube and induce the movement of the core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy. The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.\nThe valve body must be compatible with the fluid; common materials are brass, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic.\n\nThe seals must be compatible with the fluid.\n\nTo simplify the sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other components are often exposed to the fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. Stainless steels can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties. For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel) for the core and plugnut.\n\nMany variations are possible on the basic, one-way, one-solenoid valve described above:\n\nSolenoid valves are used in fluid power pneumatic and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic irrigation sprinkler systems also use solenoid valves with an automatic controller. Domestic washing machines and dishwashers use solenoid valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as \"solenoids.\" \n\nSolenoid valves can be used for a wide array of industrial applications, including general on-off control, calibration and test stands, pilot plant control loops, process control systems, and various original equipment manufacturer applications. \n\nIn 1910, ASCO Numatics became the first company to develop and manufacture the solenoid valve.\n\n\n\n"}

Freeman (27 September 1920 – 15 March 1985) was an English record producer, remembered for being Petula Clark's producer from 1949 until 1963, when his role was taken over by Tony Hatch. \n\nFreeman's ambition had always been to have a record label and make his own records with it. In 1949, he was working for the Ed Kassner music publishing company as a song plugger, when he inherited some money, and began to go ahead with his project. His friend Joe \"Mr Piano\" Henderson knew the young Clark whose father Leslie was keen to launch her as a recording artist. Joe introduced Alan to Leslie Clark, who invested some money of his own (or Petula's) in the new label.\n\nThe label, Polygon Records, was a brave attempt by Freeman to gain a footing in the British record market, at a time when it was dominated by Decca and HMV (EMI). The earliest recordings were actually made for the Australian market as Freeman had a contact there, and he wanted to test the water. By 1950, Polygon was active and during its lifetime over 180 records were made over five years, all of them produced by Freeman, including over 50 titles by Clark.\n\nBy 1955, the label had been a small success, gathering a few chart hits (the biggest of which was \"The Little Shoemaker\" by Clark, reaching no. 7), but no runaway success. Freeman was approached by New Zealand businessman Hilton Nixon who had a similar dream to his own. Hilton wanted to establish Nixa Records but had run into problems with distribution. And so it was that Polygon was swallowed up by Nixa and became Pye Nixa Records.\n\nFreeman continued to produce records, but shared responsibilities with several others. In 1959 the company had dropped the 'Nixa' part and evolved into simply Pye Records. Clark was still recording for Pye, but with little success. Freeman found a song that was to relaunch her British career. The song was \"Sailor\", written by David West, aka Norman Newell. It made no. 1 in February 1961.\n\nFreeman also produced recordings of London performances by Marlene Dietrich and records featuring British comedian Tony Hancock; the latter's re-enactments of \"The Blood Donor\" and \"The Radio Ham\" for an LP was a best seller in 1961. During the 1970s, Freeman was a frequent panellist on ATV's Saturday night talent programme, \"New Faces\".\n\nAlan A. Freeman died on 15 March 1985 in Carshalton, Surrey, survived by his sister Pat.\n\n"}

Within a few years he turned it into a restaurant patronized by the distinguished neighborhood families of the Garden District. By 1900 Commander's Palace was attracting gourmets from all over the world. Legend has it that stored alcohol was ferried across from the adjacent cemetery during prohibition for patron beverages.\n\nIn the 1920s, Frank G. Giarratano was the owner of the restaurant. He lived above the restaurant with his wife, Rose, and their two sons. There were rumors that there were private dining rooms upstairs rented to riverboat captains, visitors, etc. The upstairs rooms were the private residence of Mr. Giarratano and his family, while the downstairs, with a separate entrance, remained a family establishment. Fearing that the restaurant business would decline from what it had been during World War II, and Giarratano's declining health, in 1944 he sold Commander's Palace to Frank and Elinor Moran, who refurbished it and carried on its tradition of excellence with an expanded menu including many recipes still used. The Morans lived in the adjacent home facing Coliseum. Weather permitting, dining on the restaurant courtyard was encouraged—around a large Goldfish/Koi pond, with a large bank of electric heaters available to ward off the chill during the mild New Orleans winters. It was during this post-WWII period that many New Orleans restaurants, including Commander's Palace, received wider national/international recognition and broader acclaim.\n\nIn 1969, the famous Brennan restaurant family of New Orleans purchased the restaurant and began a redesign of the interior to complement the outdoor setting. Large windows replaced walls, and custom trellises and paintings were commissioned. Through the years, additional changes have included a redesign of the courtyard area, facility expansion into the back/side property, and the removal of much of the fence that had long separated the restaurant from the neighboring owner residence.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, the restaurant hosted the Turner South series \"Off The Menu\". Many of the segments were based on hunting and then turning the day's catch into a five-star dinner.\n\nThe restaurant suffered extensive damage due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After a full renovation, it re-opened on October 1, 2006.\n\nIn 2013, Executive Chef Tory McPhail won the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: South. In 1996, the Foundation awarded the Most Outstanding Restaurant honor to the restaurant. Other James Beard Awards include Lifetime Achievement Award (Ella Brennan) 2009, Outstanding Service Award 1993, and Best Chef, Southeast Region (Jamie Shannon) 1999.\n\nSince 2012, Commander's Palace has been a recipient of the \"Wine Spectator\" Grand Award.

{"id": "2052802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052802", "title": "The Conduct of Life", "text": "The Conduct of Life\n\nThe Conduct of Life is a collection of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson published in 1860 and revised in 1876. In this volume, Emerson sets out to answer \"the question of the times:\" \"How shall I live?\" It is composed of nine essays, each preceded by a poem. These nine essays are largely based on lectures Emerson held throughout the country, including for a young, mercantile audience in the lyceums of the Midwestern boomtowns of the 1850s.\n\n\"The Conduct of Life\" has been named as both one of Emerson's best works and one of his worst. It was one of Emerson's most successful publications and has been identified as a source of influence for a number of writers, including Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nThree years after publishing his \"English Traits\", Boston's Ticknor & Fields announced on 27 December 1859, an \"early appearance\" of a new book by Emerson titled \"The Conduct of Life.\" Confirmed as \"completed\" on 10 November 1860, Emerson’s seventh major work came out on 12 December of the same year—simultaneously in the US and in Great Britain (published there by Smith, Elder & Co.). It was advertised as \"matured philosophy of the transatlantic sage\" and sold as a collector’s item \"uniform in size and style with Mr. Emerson’s previous works.\" Quickly running through several editions in the U.S. (Ticknor & Fields announced a third edition only a week later) it was soon picked up by a third publisher (Cleveland’s Ingham & Bragg). In Great Britain, it was reported as \"selling rapidly.\" Subsequently, several passages from the book appeared in popular U.S. newspapers, most of them quoting either from 'Wealth' or 'Behavior' (especially the 'Monk Basle'-passage and Emerson’s treatment of the human eye).\n\nFirst translations of the book appeared during Emerson's lifetime in France (1864) and in Russia (1864). Still, the height of the book's international fame came around the turn of the 20th century, coinciding with a growing public interest in one of Emerson's most famous readers: Friedrich Nietzsche. Eventually, \"The Conduct of Life\" was translated into at least 13 different languages, including Serbian, Dutch and Chinese.\n\nThough hailed by Thomas Carlyle as \"the writer's best book\" and despite its commercial success, initial critical reactions to \"The Conduct Of Life\" were mixed at best. \"The Knickerbocker\" praised it for its \"healthy tone\" and called it \"the most practical of Mr. Emerson's works,\" while \"The Atlantic Monthly\" attested that \"literary ease and flexibility do not always advance with an author’s years\" and thought the essays inferior to Emerson's earlier work. Yale’s \"The New Englander\" while complimenting Emerson's abilities, criticized the book as depicting \"a universe bereft of its God\" and described its author as writing \"with the air of a man who is accustomed to be looked up to with admiring and unquestioning deference.\" \"Littell's Living Age\" found the book to contain the \"weakest kind of commonplace elaborately thrown into unintelligible shapes\" and claimed it to read in parts like an \"emasculate passage of Walt Whitman.\" Others were no less critical, proclaiming that Emerson \"has come to the end of what he had to say, and is repeating himself\" (\"Athenaeum\") or even calling him a \"phrasemonger\" and \"second-hand writer\" (\"Critic\").\n\nWhile some critics like Harold Bloom place \"The Conduct of Life\" among Emerson's best work—Bloom calls it \"a crucial last work for Americans\"—it has only been paid little critical attention.\n\nAs \"The Conduct of Life\" is, in parts, thematically grouped around practical life issues (e.g. 'Power', 'Wealth'), it has been discussed as participating \"in the aspirations of the contemporary conduct-of-life literature\" while opening up possibilities of gender fluidity. Also, despite the stronger reconciliation between self and society compared to Emerson’s previous, more individualistic works, \"The Conduct of Life\" is in no way a one-sided affirmation of American society, especially 19th century capitalism. Rather, it can be seen as a holistic attempt to develop \"principles for a good, natural, adequate conduct of life.\" As the dialectic approach of these essays often fails to come to tangible conclusions, critics like Ellen Vellela have described the whole book as weakly structured and repetitive. Others argue that \"rather than trying to dissolve the ambiguous tension of Emerson’s texts, the different arguments should be valued as a part of a dialectic that productively captures the friction of opposing poles.\" In this way, \"the workings of Emerson (…), as well as his aphoristic, succinct expressiveness could be characterized as \"Emersonian inceptions\": getting us to start thinking, planting thoughts.\" Still others found an overarching unity of design to transcend the fragmentation of Emerson’s individual essays within the volume as a whole. More recent readings see Emerson as constructing an \"ebb and flow within The Conduct of Life\" that hints at transitionality as the \"final reality of appearances.\"\n\nThe following summaries/analyses are attempts to capture the essence of the essays from \"The Conduct of Life\". The page numbers in brackets link to an online copy of the 1860 edition of the book on archive.org.\n\nIn this first essay, Emerson introduces the basic idealist principles of \"The Conduct of Life\" and seeks to reconcile the seemingly contradicting ideas of freedom and fate through a unifying Weltgeist-approach. He claims that even though the \"bulk of mankind believe [sic] in two gods\" (26)—namely free will and Providence—these concepts are really \"under one dominion\" (26) and expressions of the same beneficial force. \"A breath of will blows eternally,\" he writes \"through the universe of souls in the direction of the Right and Necessary.\" (23) Historical and societal events are therefore not merely an expression of individual actions and thought but result of \"the will of all mind\" (23) and necessitated by nature: \"When there is something to be done, the world knows how to get it done.\" (33) Still, these cosmic processes do not disenfranchise the individual, but are based on an individual desire to actualize one’s true will—a will that makes individual freedom essential: \"Liberty of the will (…) is the end and aim of this world.\" (30) Individual will and purpose, though, have very strict, biological limitations. While the \"mind of all\" might give birth to great men and leader figures, it also creates inherently inferior beings, as everyone’s individual future is \"already predetermined in his lobes, and described in that little fatty face, pig-eye, and squat form.\" (8) Here, race and genetics play a crucial role in Emerson’s line of argumentation, when, by quoting the racist writings of Robert Knox and referring to phrenology and physiognomics, Emerson claims that the \"strongest idea incarnates itself in majorities and nations, the healthiest and strongest.\" (10)\n\nLong before Friedrich Nietzsche’s coining of a similar phrase, Emerson’s essay claims that \"life is a search after power\" and that \"a cultivated man, wise to know and bold to perform, is the end to which nature works\" (45). In this framework, power is not only a desirable end, but also a natural attribute of powerful people. Such people stand out in every circle of society. The reasons for their power are their \"causationism\", self-reliance, and health. Power is thus not necessarily with the refined elite. In fact, \"the instinct of the people is right\" (54)—the heartland’s farmers’ natural way of living and their straight approach to concrete problems makes them apt to be rulers. This is a major concession of a New England intellectual to Jacksonian Democracy and a \"popular government\". However, it comes along with the optimist prospect that after all, \"power educates the potentate\" (53). In large parts, the text conceptualizes power as an attribute of a few special people. However, there is also a more pragmatic side to the text, which claims that concentration, use, and routine can also help to develop a powerful personality: \"Practice is nine tenth\" (67). In the end, the text reconciles this practical tendency with the intellectual approach to life: \"We can easily overpraise the vulgar hero.\" (69)\n\nThis text unfolds a two-sided approach to the notion of wealth: On the one hand, the economic side of the term is discussed in what seems to be a capitalist praise of America’s free market economy: \"The only safe rule is found in the self-adjusting meter of demand and supply. (…) In a free and just commonwealth, property rushes from the idle and imbecile, to the industrious, brave, and preserving\" (91). On the other hand, a criticism of early consumer-capitalism in the cities of Emerson’s time, where \"society (…) is babyish, and wealth is made a toy\" (80), brings about a redefinition of the term. Thereby, the wealthy individual is characterized as a culturally productive and well-educated member of society (\"To be rich is to have a ticket of admission to the master-works and chief men of each race.\" 86), whilst the wealth of a society as a whole can be measured by the degree of (cultural) participation it offers its citizens (\"in America, (…) the public should (…) provide this culture and inspiration to the citizen.\" 85-86). Thus, the term wealth is not reduced to being rich in pecuniary terms, but widened to cultural, moral and psychological aspects. In Emerson’s terms: \"Wealth is mental; wealth is moral.\" (89)\n\nBy exploring the multitude of different facets of \"culture\", Emerson points out its complexity (and thereby its resistance to be defined in clear-cut terms). For him, culture should not only be understood in the context of social community, but also on the level of the individual: in fact, individuality is thought of as the basis of culture (cf. 116). More specifically, culture is conceptualized as self-cultivation in an educational sense – a life-long process which \"cannot begin too early\" (142). In a world that is driven by \"the pursuit of power and of wealth as a means of power\" (113), culture is a corrective force: it \"corrects the theory of success\" (113). It has a balancing effect, since it \"modulate[s] the violence of any master-tones that have a droning preponderance in [man’s] scale\" and thereby \"redresses his balance\" (118). As the physical sphere of this educational process Emerson praises the urban—the cities that \"give us collision\" (129)—as a place of intellectual stimulation just as he praises solitude, \"to genius the stern friend\" (134), which can be found in nature. Emerson breaks with the myth of culture being thought of as \"high\" culture: for him cultural competence is not only the acquisition of knowledge through literature, but more importantly an experiential process through the active involvement with and in nature: \"Archery, cricket, gun and fishing rod, horse and boat, are all educators, liberalizers.\" (123)\n\nIn this essay, Emerson uses the term \"behavior\" synonymously with the term \"manners\" and defines it as \"the visible carriage or action of the individual\" (147). Nature’s truth within the human being is exteriorized, made visible, through the \"silent and subtile language\" (147) of the human body as a fascinating means of non-verbal communication. Emerson celebrates \"the wonderful expressiveness of the human body\" (154) while especially emphasizing the eyes—\"another self\" (156)—as being the most universally understood, hence highly revealing (and almost erotic), means of interpersonal exchange. Emerson does not only conceptualize behavior as the basic mode of human expression, but also defines what it means to have good manners: \"the basis of good manners is self-reliance\" (162). To the list of desirable traits he also adds \"integrity\" (165), \"directness\" (168), \"sincerity\" (168), \"uprightness\" (168) and \"self-control\" (170). Once a person has the kinds of manners which \"indicate real power\" (164), \"he or she must be considered, and is everywhere welcome, though without beauty, or wealth, or genius\" (148). Here, manners are turned into a democratic means, which can transcend biological as well as social inequalities. At the same time, however, the selective function of manners operating in a society that \"resists and sneers at you; or quietly drops you\" (162) if you do not follow its rules is addressed. Only the true genius has the potential to overcome \"all the observances, yea, and duties, which society so tyrannically imposes on the rank and file of its members.\" (163)\n\nIn this essay, Emerson describes and explains shifts in practices and objects of worship. He moves from skeptical concerns to a holistic religion to come, founded on morals and intellect, and merging faith, science, aesthetics, and arts. Worship is not limited to religious beliefs, but also relates to intellect, health, and beauty. Taken together, \"the whole state of man is a state of culture; and its flowering and completion may be described as Religion, or Worship\" (178). At the outset, Emerson diagnoses a decline of religion and moral beliefs. Large parts of the population tend to worship only science, wealth, and public opinion. Consequently, \"we live in a transition period, where the old faiths (...) seem to have lost their force\" (180). This can be devastating for communities if it results in a \"distrust in human virtue\" (183). But since Emerson is equally critical of demoralizing \"know-nothing religions\" (181), he says, \"forget your books and traditions, and obey your moral perceptions\" (187). Science, religion, and moral beliefs are indeed compatible—for those who see the \"unity, intimacy, and sincerity\" (191) in nature, which find expression, for example, in cause and effect. Accordingly, Emerson repeatedly emphasizes the importance of both mental and physical activity, encapsulated in his idea of \"voluntary obedience\" or \"necessitated freedom\" (209). Emerson envisages the future religion to be intellectual and the future church to be grounded in moral science.\n\nThis essay revolves around certain recurring and intertwined aspects of Emerson’s thought—most notably, society, culture, morals, nature, the meaning of life, and friendship. Emerson says that, while fine souls are empowering and inspiring, fine society is excluding and deadening. Similarly, he does not wish \"to concede anything to 'the masses', but to tame, drill, divide, and break them up, and draw individuals out of them\" (219). They are \"unripe, and have not yet come to themselves, do not yet know their opinion\" (221). Individualism, to Emerson, is crucial to intellectual and historical achievements. One of the most central lessons to learn is \"the good of evil\" (222). Antagonism is vital to nature. In both the private and social spheres, many great achievements \"are brought about by discreditable means\" (225). Emerson concludes that humans are indebted to their vices (228). As for the development of character, it is essential to \"know the realities of human life\" (230). In addition to self-reliance, Emerson’s advice is to live a healthy life and to be productive. Also, friends \"to whom we can say what we cannot say to ourselves,\" (236) as well as people \"who shall make us do what we can\" (239), are essential. Emerson closes the essay on an encouraging note by saying, \"life brings to each his task, and whatever art you select, (…) begin at the beginning, proceed in order, step by step\" (243). His concluding remarks resonate with many of his other writings: he demands \"the escape from all false ties; courage to be what we are; and love of what is simple and beautiful; independence, and cheerful relation to add something to the well-being of men.\" (244)\n\nEmerson next turns to Beauty, a topic he dealt with in \"Nature\" in 1836. Looking at beauty from different angles, Emerson works toward solving the problem of defining beauty by exploring examples, counterexamples, and qualities of beauty. In this last essay on Beauty, Emerson is less systematic than in his three-section investigation of beauty in Nature. First comes a criticism of science for moving far away \"from its objects!\" (247) More explicitly, \"All our science lacks a human side.\" (248). Defining beauty in order to encourage a return to affection, Emerson writes, \"Beauty is the form under which the intellect prefers to study the world. All privilege is that of beauty; for there are many beauties; as, of general nature, of the human face and form, of manners, of brain, or method, moral beauty, or beauty of the soul.\" (252). Then ensues a study of beauty through examples and explanations, \"We ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous parts; which exactly answers its ends; which stands related to all things; which is the mean of many extremes. It is the most enduring quality and the most ascending quality.\" (254). Investigating beauty in nature, society, rhetoric, art, architecture, and women, he comments \"The line of beauty is the result of perfect economy\" and \"Beauty is the quality which makes to endure\" (259). The comparison of beauty to ugliness brings Emerson to the essence of his argument, \"Things are pretty, graceful, rich, elegant, handsome, but, until they speak to the imagination, not yet beautiful.\" (266). The conclusion begs for a broader and more integrated understanding of the world:\n\nThe last passage in the essay is \"the perception of Plato, that globe and universe are rude and carly expressions of an all-dissolving Unity, —the first stair on the scale to the temple of the Mind.\"\n\nThe final essay of the book, 'Illusions', is more clearly structured than 'Beauty'. It begins with Emerson’s recollections about his trip to Mammoth Cave in Kentucky and his reflection on the illusion of the night sky when he went into the 'Star Chamber': \"Some crystal specks in the black ceiling high overhead, reflecting the light of a half-hid lamp, yielded this magnificent effect.\" (274). In a closer examination of sensory perception, Emerson writes \"Our conversation with Nature is not just what it seems\" (274) and \"[the] senses interfere everywhere and mix their own structure with all they report of it.\" (275). Turning to illusions in society, Emerson writes: \"Nobody drops his domino\" and \"[…] we rightly accuse the critic who destroys too many illusions. Society does not love its unmaskers.\" (276). Here, he offers an aphorism: \"Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.\" (277). Emerson continues to examine specific illusions, most notably marriage as a (happy) illusion: \"We live amid hallucinations; and this especial trap is laid to trip up our feet with, and all are tripped up first or last.\" (279). He then suggests options for dealing with illusions: \"Whatever games are played with us, we must play no games with ourselves, but deal in our privacy with the last honesty and truth.\" (285). Emerson turns back to a spiritual connection at the conclusion of the essay and the collection: \"We see God face to face every hour, and know the savor of Nature.\" (286).\n\nIn accordance with Emerson’s increasingly conservative notion of society, \"The Conduct of Life\" formulates a critique of the Brook Farm community, a utopist experiment in communal living founded by his colleague and fellow transcendentalist George Ripley in 1841. While intellectually in agreement with the community’s goals at the time, Emerson declined an invitation to participate, listing mostly personal reasons (like having \"little skill to converse with people\" and \"I think that all I shall solidly do, I must do alone\") and \"skepticism in regard to the general practicability of the plan\" for his decision. In \"The Conduct of Life\", written some two decades after the Brook Farm experiment ended, Emerson strictly distances himself from what he now calls \"Arcadian fanaticism\" (99) and describes the commune’s ultimate demise as having \"cured [its participants] of their faith that scholarship and practical farming (…) could be united.\" (99) \"The genius of reading and of gardening\", he argues in ‘Wealth’, \"are antagonistic, like resinous and vitreous electricity.\" (100)\n\nIn his Essay 'Emerson' (1898), John Jay Chapman claims with regards to Emerson that \"not a boy in the land welcomed the outbreak of the war so fiercely as did this shy village philosopher.\" For Emerson, the Civil War \"was sure to bring in character, to leave behind it a file of heroes; if not heroes, then villains, but in any case strong men,\" Chapman states. Indeed, \"The Conduct Of Life\", written during the political run-up to secession and published after the bombardment of Fort Sumter, finds Emerson embracing the idea of war as a means of national rebirth. \"Wars, fires, plagues,\" Emerson writes in ‘Considerations by the Way’, \"break up immovable routine, clear the ground of rotten races and dens of distemper, and open a fair field to new men.\" (223) In nature, Emerson argues, creation is always preceded by destruction and in the intensity of conflict and battle, humanity shines ever more brightly: \"civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution, [are] more rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity.\" (230)\n\nWhen Walt Whitman came to Boston in March 1860 to meet the publishers for his third edition of \"Leaves of Grass\", he spent a day with Emerson, who had been one of Whitman’s earliest supporters, to discuss his new poems. Troubled by their sexual explicitness, Emerson urged the young poet to \"expurgate\" his work. Whitman refused and, later in his life, came to sum up this experience as \"If you can't walk into popularity on your feet, crawl in on your hands and marrows.\" \"The Conduct of Life\", which Emerson was composing around that time, seems to recall that discussion and puts Emerson’s critique of Whitman in a societal and cultural perspective. In a passage in 'Culture,' Emerson demonstrates that censure can benefit the poet—and that refusal to accept censure can be looked at as anti-democratic:\n\nChinese\n\nCzech\n\nDutch\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nGreek\n\nItalian\n\nJapanese\n\nPortuguese \n\nRussian\nSerbian\nSpanish\n\nUrdu\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2052806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052806", "title": "Cartoon Action Hour", "text": "Cartoon Action Hour\n\nCartoon Action Hour is a role-playing game (RPG) designed to emulate classic action-adventure cartoons, such as \"ThunderCats\", \"He-Man\", \"\", \"G.I. Joe\", \"\", \"Inhumanoids\", \"Centurions\", \"Thundarr the Barbarian\", \"M.A.S.K.\", and \"Bravestarr\".\n\nIt was e-published by Spectrum Games as a PDF role-playing game in early 2002, where it garnered a sizable cult following. This prompted Z-Man Games to offer to publish the game as a hardcopy edition. The material from the PDF was revised and expanded upon for the 2003 print version.\n\n\"Cartoon Action Hour\" implements a relatively simple ruleset. The core resolution system revolves around rolling a d12, adding a number to it, and comparing it to a \"Difficulty Number\". If the result equals or exceeds that \"Difficulty Number\", the character succeeds in the task at hand.\n\nWhereas most RPGs give all characters an identical list of attributes (such as Strength, Agility, Intelligence, etc.) and a variable collection of skills, \"Cartoon Action Hour\" rolls them all into one type of statistic known as Traits. Each character will have a different list of Traits, with ratings ranging from −4 (nearly non-existent) to 4 (maximum human capability), with 0 being average.\n\nTo represent Traits with superhuman or supernatural levels of ability, the designers use super-ratings. Characters with a Trait rating of 4 may have another number in parenthesis, ranging from 2 to 5. This super-rating allows the player to roll more than one d12 when testing that Trait, taking the best result.\n\nSuperpowers, magic spells, vehicles, weapons, armor, racial abilities, animal companions, psionic abilities, and magic artifacts—They can all be created using the Special Ability creation rules. Each Special Ability is designed by picking and choosing appropriate \"components\" that define it. For example, an energy blast would need the following components: \"Damage Rating\" and \"Range\". This can easily be customized further by adding other components and modifiers, thus making the Special Ability truly unique.\n\nEvery facet of \"Cartoon Action Hour\" was created with an eye toward faithfully depicting the subject matter, using what the authors refer to as \"cartoon logic\". A few examples of this are as follows:\n\nReviewer Matthew Pook noted that \"the look of \"Cartoon Action Hour\" belies its origins as an amateur publication. Its layout is overly cluttered and fussy, with its desktop publishing style readily apparent\" and \"there should be something to please anyone who is a fan of the genre within the pages of this book. Plus the rules and mechanics are nicely simple, making it easy to get into and play up to the epic heroism of \"Cartoon Action Hour\"\".\n\nSeason Two of \"Cartoon Action Hour\" was released on Oct 31, 2008 as a PDF on RPG on RPGNow.com. On December 16, 2008, the print version of the book was placed on Lulu. The rule book feature three series, \"Warriors of Cosmos\" (a science-fiction fantasy in the style of \"He-Man\"), \"Strikeforce Freedom\" (a \"G.I. Joe\" with Cobra being replaced by a spider-theme terrorist group) and \"Transbots\" (a \"Transforming Robots\" series in which the robots are built and work for rival companies.)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052837", "title": "Precinct of Amun-Re", "text": "Precinct of Amun-Re\n\nThe Precinct of Amun-Re, located near Luxor, Egypt, is one of the four main temple enclosures that make up the immense Karnak Temple Complex. The precinct is by far the largest of these and the only one that is open to the general public. The temple complex is dedicated to the principal god of the Theban Triad, Amun, in the form of Amun-Re.\n\nThe site occupies some 250,000 m² and contains many structures and monuments. The main temple itself, the Temple of Amun, covers some 61 acres and could accommodate 10 average European cathedrals. Some parts of the complex are closed or semi-closed, including large parts of the North-South Axis (the 8th, 9th, and 10th pylons), which are under active excavation or restoration. The whole southeast corner is semi-closed. The northwest corner is a museum that requires an additional ticket to visit.\n\nMost of the southwest is an open-air assembling area containing millions of stone fragments, from small to huge, laid out in long rows, awaiting reassembly into their respective monuments. The area is not closed, as the temples of Khons and Opet both lie in this corner and are open to the public, though both are rarely visited, relative to the huge numbers of tourists who come to Karnak. Also found in that area is the Akhenaten Temple Project, in a sealed long building which contains surviving remnants of the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten).\n\nThe history of the Karnak complex is largely the history of Thebes. The city does not appear to have been of any significance before the Eleventh Dynasty, and any temple building here would have been relatively small and unimportant, with any shrines being dedicated to the early god of Thebes, Montu. The earliest artifact found in the area of the temple is a small, eight-sided column from the Eleventh Dynasty, which mentions Amun-Ra. The tomb of Intef II mentions a 'house of Amun', which implies some structure, whether a shrine or a small temple is unknown. The ancient name for Karnak, \"Ipet-Sut\" (usually translated as 'most select of places') only really refers to the central core structures of the Precinct of Amun-Ra, and was in use as early as the 11th Dynasty, again implying the presence of some form of temple before the Middle Kingdom expansion.\n\nThe main temple is laid out on an east–west axis, entered via a quay (now dry and several hundred metres from the Nile).\n\nThe modern entrance is placed over the end of the ancient cult terrace (or tribune), causing most visitors to miss this significant feature. Inscribed into the terrace (though many are now eroded away) are the inundation levels for several kings of the Third Intermediate Period, collectively known as the Nile Level Texts. The cult terrace is often mistakenly thought to be a dock or quay, but other examples, such as the one at the Hathor temple at Deir al-Madinah, do not have access to water. It was intended for the presentation of cult images.\n\nOriginally the quay led via a corridor of Sphinxes to the entrance to the second pylon, but these were moved aside when the First Pylon was constructed.\n\nConstruction of the current pylon began in 30th dynasty, but was never totally completed. It is 113m wide and 15m thick. There are large numbers of mud bricks piled up against the inside of the pylon, and these give a clue as to how it was constructed.\n\nThe construction of the original first pylon and Forecourt in the 22nd dynasty enclosed several older structures, and meant that the original avenue of sphinxes had to be moved.\n\nThese were built in the time of Seti II, and are dedicated to Amun, Mut, and Khonsu.\n\nIn order to construct this kiosk, the ram-sphinx corridor was removed and the statues moved to the edges of the open court. Only one column remains in place, bearing inscriptions by Taharqa, Psamtik II and Ptolemy IV Philopator.\n\nOn the south side of the forecourt, there is a small temple built by Ramesses III. Inscriptions inside the temple show the king slaughtering captives, whilst Amun-Re looks on.\n\nThis portal allows exit from the first court to the area to the south of the Temple of Ramesses III. It records the conquests and military campaigns in Syria-Palestine of Shoshenq I, of the Twenty-second Dynasty.\n\nThis pylon was built by Horemheb near the end of his reign and only partly decorated by him. Ramesses I usurped Horemheb's reliefs and inscriptions on the pylon and added his own to them. These were later usurped by Ramesses II. The east (rear) face of the pylon became the west wall of the newly built Great Hypostyle Hall under Seti I who added some honorary images of the late Ramesses I to compensate for having had to erase his father's images there when he built the hall.\n\nHoremheb filled the interior of the pylon towers with thousands of recycled blocks from dismantled monuments of his predecessors, especially Talatat blocks from the monuments of Akhenaten along with a temple of Tutankhamen and Ay.\n\nThe Second Pylon's roof collapsed in late antiquity and was later restored in Ptolemaic times.\n\nThis was begun by Seti I, and completed by Ramesses II. The north side of the hall is decorated in raised relief, and was Seti I's work. He began to decorate the southern side of the hall shortly before he died but this section was largely completed by his son, Ramesses II. Ramesses decoration was at first in raised relief, but he quickly changed to sunk relief and then converted his raised relief decoration in the southern part of the hall, along with the few reliefs of Seti there, to sunk relief. He left Seti I's reliefs in the north wing as raised relief. Ramesses also changed Seti's names to his own along the main east–west axis of the Hall and along the northern part of the north–south processional route while respecting most of his father's reliefs elsewhere in the hall.\n\nThe outer walls depict scenes of battle, Seti I on the north and Ramesses II on the south. These scenes may not show actual combat, but could have a ritual purpose as well. Adjoining the southern wall of Ramesses II is another wall that contains the text of the peace treaty he signed with the Hittites in the year 21 of his reign.\n\nThrough the walls of the Hypostyle Hall is the mostly ruined Transverse Hall, alongside a reconstructed Third Pylon of Amenhotep III. Though much ruined, in antiquity it was quite splendid and parts of it were even plated in gold by pharaoh Amenhotep III. A vestibule was added late in the pharaoh's reign and then partly decorated with incompleted triumph scenes by Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten before the new pharaoh abandoned the project due to his religious revolution which rejected the cult of the god Amun-Re.\n\nIn building the Third Pylon, Amenhotep dismantled a number of older monuments, including a small gateway he himself built earlier in the reign. He deposited hundreds of blocks from these monuments inside the pylon towers as fill. These were recovered by Egyptologists in the early 20th century and led to the reconstruction of several lost monuments, including the White Chapel of Senusret I and the red chapel of Queen Hatshepsut, which are now in the open-air museum at Karnak. At the time of its construction, Amenhotep III had the Third Pylon gilded and covered with precious stones, as he relates on a stela now in the Cairo museum:\n\nThe reliefs on the pylon were later restored by Tutankhamen who also inserted images of himself. These were, in turn, later erased by Horemheb. The erased images of Tutankhamen were long thought to be of Akhenaten himself, supposedly evidence of a coregency between Akhenaten and Amenhotep III, though most scholars now reject this.\n\nIn a narrow court, there are several obelisks, one which dates from Thutmose I, and is 21.2 m high and weighs nearly 150 tons. Just beyond this is the remaining obelisk of Hatshepsut, nearly 30 m in height. Later kings blocked out the view of this from ground level, and constructed walls around it. Its companion lies, broken, by the sacred lake.\n\nThese were built by Thutmose I.\n\nThe Sixth Pylon was built by Thutmose III, and leads into a Hall of Records in which the king recorded his tributes. The pylon also includes some images of the god Amun which were restored by Tutankhamen after they were vandalized by Akhenaten. These images were later recarved by Horemheb who also usurped Tutankhamun's restoration inscriptions.\n\nThe sanctuary was built in the time of Philip Arrhidaeus, on the site of the earlier sanctuary built by Thutmose III. This sanctuary contains blocks from the earlier sanctuary and older inscriptions can still be seen.\n\nOnly the base of three doors mark the entrances to the internal structures of this court.\n\nThis stands to the east of the main temple complex. Between the sanctuary and the festival hall is an open space, and this is thought to be where the original Middle Kingdom shrines and temples were located, before their later dismantling.\n\nThe Festival Hall (or \"Akh-menu\" – \"the most glorious of monuments\") itself has its axis at right-angles to the main east–west axis of the temple. It was originally built to celebrate the jubilee (Hed-Sed) of Thutmose III, and later became used as part of the annual Opet Festival. In this temple, the Karnak king list, shows Thutmose III with some of the earlier kings that built parts of the temple complex. It contains the Botanical garden of Thutmosis III.\n\nThis axis, with its massive pylons, heads off to the Precinct of Mut. Most of this area is off limits to tourists, as it is under active reconstruction and excavation.\n\nOver 900 statues were discovered in 1903 by Georges Legrain buried under this open court. These had been buried there, probably in the Ptolemaic period, during one of the clearances of the complex for rebuilding or construction.\n\nOn the southern side, there is a carving of Thutmose III smiting Asiatic enemies, under which is a list of names of towns and peoples conquered in his campaigns in Syria-Palestine.\n\nOff to the eastern side of the court is an alabaster shrine, constructed for the jubilee of Thutmose III.\n\nConstructed by Hatshepsut, the seventh pylon marks the end of the area that is normally accessible to the public.\n\nThis pylon was constructed (or at least completed) by Horemheb. It is hollow and allows access to its top, via internal staircases.\n\nAgain, it was Horemheb who built this last pylon, using the Talatat from the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV as core building material. There are four registers of scenes around the gateway, in the name of Horemheb.\n\nLocated within the outer precincts of the complex are a number of other structures, some of which are accessible to the public.\n\nThe sacred lake was where priests purified themselves before performing rituals in the temple. The sound and light show is now viewed from a seating area next to the lake.\n\nThis small temple lies to the north of the main Amun temple, just within the boundary wall. The building was erected by Thutmose III, on the site of an earlier Middle Kingdom temple. The building was later enlarged by the Ptolemies.\n\nAlso known as the Temple of the Hearing Ear this temple is located to the east of the main complex, on the east–west alignment. It was built during the reign of Ramesses II.\n\nThis temple is an example of an almost complete New Kingdom temple, and was originally constructed by Ramesses III, on the site of an earlier temple (the construction seems to be mentioned in the Harris Papyrus).\n\nSeveral of the pylons reused earlier structures in their core. In the Open Air Museum, located in the Northwest corner of the complex, there are reconstructions of some of these earlier structures, notable amongst them the Chapelle Rouge of Hatshepsut, and the White Chapel of Senusret I.\n\n\n"}

ONNV is a togavirus (family Togaviridae), genus \"Alphavirus\", is closely related to the chikungunya and Igbo Ora viruses, and is a member of the Semliki Forest antigenic complex. The name was given to the disease by the Acholi tribe during the 1959 outbreak. The name comes from the Nilotic language of Uganda and Sudan and means “weakening of the joints\". The virus can infect humans and may cause disease.\n\nCommon symptoms of infection with the virus are polyarthritis, rash and fever. Other symptoms include eye pain, chest pain, lymphadenitis and lethargy. The disease is self-limiting. No fatalities due to infection are known.\n\nONNV has at least three major subtypes, or strains, the genomic sequences of which are currently available on genome databases.\n\nONNV is transmitted by bites from an infected mosquito. It is the only virus whose primary vectors are anopheline mosquitoes (\"Anopheles funestus\" and \"Anopheles gambiae\").\n\nThere have been two epidemics of o’nyong’nyong fever. The first occurred from 1959 to 1962, spreading from Uganda to Kenya, Tanzania, Zaire (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Malawi and Mozambique, and affecting over two million people, one of the largest arbovirus epidemics ever recorded. The first virus isolates were obtained during this outbreak from mosquitoes and human blood samples collected from Gulu in northern Uganda in 1959.\n\nThe second epidemic in 1996–1997 was confined to Uganda. The 35-year hiatus between the two outbreaks and evidence of an outbreak in 1904–1906 in Uganda indicate a 30–50 year cycle for epidemics.\n\nIn 2013, ONNV was confirmed as the cause of disease in a 60-year-old German woman who became infected while traveling in East Africa. In 2015–2016 there was a minor outbreak in Uganda with 51 suspected cases.\n\nThere has been a minor outbreak in Mombasa (Kenya) and the County Government of Mombasa issued a warning.\nA 2015 study indicated that ONNV is endemic in coastal East Africa, along with chikungunya virus.\n"}

In the USWA, Chris turned heel and wrestled for manager Skandor Akbar's \"Devastation Inc.\" as Pronto, a mockery of his American Indian heritage. During this time Chris had a feud with a young up and coming Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nChris and Mark had a very successful run in being one of the most popular tag teams in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council and added numerous Tag Title reigns under their belts. But on July 17, 1988 The Romeros were in the locker room when a wrestler named José Huertas stabbed and killed Bruiser Brody. Huertas went to trial but did not do any jail time for the crime. The WWC did nothing to help convict Huertas and The Romeros left the WWC right after the incident and went on to sign with Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling where he and Mark were known as \"The Renegade Warriors\". The two were frequently used on WCW TV and had numerous feuds with The Steiner Brothers and The Road Warriors.\n\nIn the late 1990s Chris began using the name \"The Visionary\" Chris Romero. Chris completed many Japanese tours as a singles competitor where he gained victories over ECW's own, Rob Van Dam. Chris later formed a Tag Team in Japan's FMW with \"Super\" Leatherface.

The government is aware of the problem and plans a major new road-building program to relieve the pressure. The alternative, heavy investment in public mass transport systems such as railways, is ignored because it clashes with the government's ideology. The author argues that this is a highly misguided policy since, in his view, more roads have historically tended to simply generate more traffic and so create an even bigger problem in the long run.\n\nThe climax of the book sees shadowy, possibly government-backed forces deliberately instigate the necessary simultaneous accidents which do indeed bring the whole of London to a standstill for several days. The resulting chaos is used as an excuse to press ahead with the road-building scheme.\n\nThe novel is a satire of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government policies, which emphasised road traffic over rail or other public transportation.\n\nAnother major element in the novel revolves round a character with cerebral palsy – he is the inventor of a hydrogen-based power system for cars – green energy – that sinister forces, most likely representing the oil industry, seek to suppress. His disability is aggressive-sympathetically handled, for example he actively embraces the word 'spastic', claiming it back, taking it away from the term of abuse it had become (in the UK) at the time of publication.\n"}
{"id": "2052891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052891", "title": "Verisimilitude", "text": "Verisimilitude\n\nVerisimilitude (or truthlikeness) is the philosophical notion that some propositions are more true or less true than other propositions. The problem of verisimilitude is the problem of articulating what it takes for one false theory to be closer to the truth than another false theory.\n\nThis problem was central to the philosophy of Karl Popper, largely because Popper was among the first to affirm that truth is the aim of scientific inquiry while acknowledging that most of the greatest scientific theories in the history of science are, strictly speaking, false. If this long string of purportedly false theories is to constitute progress with respect to the goal of truth, then it must be at least possible for one false theory to be closer to the truth than others.\n\nPopper assumed that scientists are interested in highly informative theories, in part for methodological reasons—the more informative a theory, the easier it is to test, and the greater its predictive power. But clearly informative power by itself is rather easy to come by, and we do not want to gain content by sacrificing truths. So Popper proposed that closeness to the truth is a function of two factors—truth and content. The more truths that a theory entails (other things being equal) the closer it is to the truth. \n\nIntuitively at least, it seems that Newton's theory of motion entails a good many more truths than does, say, Aristotle's theory—despite the fact that both are known to have flaws. Even two true theories can have differing degrees of verisimilitude, depending on how much true information they deliver. For example, the claim \"it will be raining on Thursday next week,\" if true, seems closer to the truth than the true yet logically weaker claim \"it will either be raining next Thursday or it will be sunny\".\n\nPopper's formal definition of verisimilitude was challenged since 1974 by Pavel Tichý, John Henry Harris, and David Miller, who argued that Popper's definition has an unintended consequence: that no false theory can be closer to the truth than another. Popper himself stated: \"I accepted the criticism of my definition within minutes of its presentation, wondering why I had not seen the mistake before.\" This result gave rise to a search for an account of verisimilitude that did not deem progress towards the truth an impossibility.\n\nSome of the new theories (e.g. those proposed by David Miller and by Theo Kuipers) build on Popper's approach, guided by the notion that truthlikeness is a function of a truth factor and a content factor. Others (e.g. those advanced by in collaboration with , by Mortensen, and by Ken Gemes) are also inspired by Popper's approach but locate what they believe to be the error of Popper's proposal in his overly generous notion of content, or consequence, proposing instead that the consequences that contribute to closeness to truth must be, in a technical sense, \"relevant\". A different approach (already proposed by Tichý and and developed especially by Ilkka Niiniluoto and Graham Oddie) takes the \"likeness\" in truthlikeness literally, holding that a proposition's likeness to the truth is a function of the overall likeness to the actual world of the possible worlds in which the proposition would be true. An attempt to use the notion of point-free metric space is proposed by Giangiacomo Gerla. There is currently a debate about whether or to what extent these different approaches to the concept are compatible.\n\nAnother problem in Popper's theory of verisimilitude is the connection between truthlikeness as the goal of scientific progress, on the one hand, and methodology, on the other hand, as the ways in which we can to some extent ensure that scientific research actually approaches this goal. Popper conceived of his definition as a justification of his own preferred methodology: falsificationism, in the following sense: suppose theory A is closer to the truth than theory B according to Popper's qualitative definition of verisimilitude; in this case, we will (or should, if that definition had been logically sound) have that all true consequences of B (ie: all predicted consequences of theory B's mathematical and physical predictions subject to a particular set of initial conditions) are consequences of [theory] A (['s] similarly predicted consequences – i.e., informally, B ≤ A), and that all false consequences of A are consequences of B (in that those set of events deemed impossible by theory A are a subset of those events deemed impossible B, subject to the same initial data conditions for both – i.e., informally, ¬B ≥ ¬A, so that ¬A ≤ ¬B); this means that, if A and B are so related, then it should be the case that all \"known\" false empirical consequences of A also follow from B, and all \"known\" true empirical consequences of B do follow from A. So, if A were closer to the truth than B, then A should be better corroborated than B by any possible amount of empirical evidence. Lastly, this easy theorem allows interpretation of the fact that A is actually better corroborated than B as a \"corroboration of the hypothesis\" (or 'meta-hypothesis') that A is more verisimilar than B.\n\n"}

Each year, twenty National Finalists gather at a nationally recognized institution for a two-week training camp. From the program's inception through 2009, the camp was held at George Mason University; from 2010 through 2015, the camp was held at Purdue University. It was then hosted at Marymount University for 2016 and 2017. As of 2018, it is being held at University of California, San Diego. At the end of the two weeks, four students are selected to represent the United States at the International Biology Olympiad.\n\nThe USA Biolympiad was first started in 2002, with nearly 10,000 students competing annually. Ever since the CEE (Center for Excellence in Education) started to administer the USABO exam, all four members of the Team USA in the years 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 were awarded gold medals in the International Biology Olympiad, with the US National Team able to accrue the most medals and subsequently win the IBO in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, partly due to the rigorous selection process students undergo to compete in the IBO for the US.\n\nUSABO finalists are selected in two rounds of tests. The open exam is a 50-minute multiple-choice exam open to all high school students, who register through their school or an authorized USABO center. This exam is normally administered during the first week of February, though the exact test time may vary from year to year. During this round, there is no penalty for wrong answers, but students may only select one of the four or five choices for each question.\n\nThe top 500 students on the open exam, or roughly 10% of all participating students, advance to the semi-final round, which will be administered in March. This second exam consists of a 120-minute long test, subdivided into two multiple-choice sections and one free response section. Part A of the exam is primarily multiple choice questions with one answer. Part B has more complex, sequenced multiple choice questions that may have several correct answers and may require calculations or extensive interpretation of graphs and multiple true/false choice questions, while Part C normally takes the form of short answers or an extended essay.\n\nThe final round of the USABO takes place as a national finals round, attended by the 20 top-scoring students on the Semifinal Exam. Students may take a 24-hour leave to return home for graduation purposes, as the CEE recognizes that the dates of the National Finals may conflict with high school graduation.\n\nDuring the first ten days of instruction, university professors and experts in research and undergraduate/graduate teaching will be assisted by former USABO Finalists in teaching laboratory techniques and conceptual understanding to the finalists. After the ten days of instruction, a 9-hour long exam occurs, with students required to take the exams on the scheduled dates. This exam is divided into two sections: a 6 hour long practical exam and a 3-hour theoretical exam containing true/false questions and multiple choice questions. The scores from the two exams are combined to form a comprehensive ranking, with the 9th-12th placed finalists receiving a bronze medal, the 5th-8th placed finalists receiving a Silver medal, and the 1st-4th placed medalists receiving a Gold medal, and the chance to compete on the US national team in the IBO.\n\n"}

Evans (born Clement Anselm Evans; February 25, 1833 – July 2, 1911) was a Confederate army infantry general in the American Civil War. He was also a politician, preacher, historian and author. He edited a twelve-volume work on Confederate military history, so named, in 1899.\n\nEvans was born in Stewart County, Georgia, near the city of Lumpkin. In 1854 Evans married Mary Allen \"Allie\" Walton whose marriage brought eight children, three of whom died in infancy. He studied at the Augusta Law School and was admitted to the bar at the age of 18. By the age of 21, he was a county judge, and a state senator at the age of 25. With the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Evans organized a company of militia.\n\nEvans was commissioned as major of the 31st Georgia Infantry on November 19, 1861, and was promoted to colonel on May 13, 1862, fighting in the Seven Days Battles, Second Manassas, and Antietam. He had temporary command of Alexander Lawton's Georgia brigade from September until November 1862, seeing additional action at Fredericksburg. During the Gettysburg Campaign and the 1864 fighting at the Wilderness and Spotsylvania, Evans again commanded the 31st Georgia while John B. Gordon commanded the brigade.\n\nEvans was promoted to brigadier general in May 1864 (replacing Gordon who ascended to division command) and was wounded at Monocacy. He commanded Gordon's Division/Second Corps from Petersburg to Appomattox. Evans survived five wounds during the war.\n\nAfter the war ended, he became an influential Methodist minister, advancing the “holiness movement,” a controversial doctrine that eventually split the denomination. He pastored churches in the Atlanta area, some with memberships as large as 1,000, until his retirement in 1892. Three years later, Evans authored the \"Military History of Georgia\", heavily based upon his Civil War memoirs. He then edited and co-wrote the \"Confederate Military History\", a 12-volume compendium, first published in 1899. Finally, he co-authored the four-volume \"Cyclopedia of Georgia\". Regarding the war, Evans said:\n\nEvans was very active in establishing and administering fraternal veterans organizations following the war. He helped organize the Confederate Survivors Association (a regional group based in Augusta, Georgia) in 1878 and served as its first president. He was a founder of the first national Confederate veterans group, the United Confederate Veterans, in 1889 and commander of the UCV's Georgia division for twelve years.\n\nEvans died in Atlanta on July 2, 1911: his body lay in state in the central rotunda of the capitol building while the state legislature adjourned for a day to attend his funeral. Evans was buried in Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery, just a few feet away from the grave of John Gordon. The state legislature created Evans County in the southeastern part of Georgia in 1914 in honor of his memory.\n\n\n\n"}

The ship was laid down on 1 October 1919 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.; launched on 5 June 1920; delivered to the United States Shipping Board late that year; and acquired by the Navy at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 6 March 1922.\n\n\"Tippecanoe\" remained inactive at Mare Island for almost two decades before she was finally placed in commission on 6 March 1940, Comdr. Hugh W. Olds in command. The oiler was assigned to Squadron 8, Base Force Train, and operated between the west coast and the Hawaiian Islands for the next two years. Her most frequent ports of call were Pearl Harbor, San Pedro, San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle.\n\nWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, fortune ordained that \"Tippecanoe\" be safe in San Francisco. During the first three months of the war, the oiler steamed up and down the west coast between San Diego, San Pedro, San Francisco, and Seattle. She did not leave the west coast until 3 February when she headed back to Hawaii. She entered Pearl Harbor on the 17th and lay over there until 3 March when she headed for the South Pacific. After a brief stop at Pago Pago, Samoa, the ship put to sea on 15 March and headed to an area north of New Caledonia to fuel Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's Task Force 17 (TF17). She returned to the vicinity of Samoa on 26 March, visited Tongatapu on 6 April, and put into Noumea, New Caledonia, on the 26th.\n\nOn 1 May, the oiler put to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 once more. She made contact with Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch's task unit—built around —and, on the 2nd and 3rd, fueled the venerable carrier and her supporting ships. Drained bone dry, \"Tippecanoe\" then headed for Efate where she arrived on 4 May, the day Rear Admiral Fletcher's airmen struck the Japanese seaplane base at Tulagi to open the preliminaries of the historic action that stopped Japan's southward advance. During the Battle of the Coral Sea itself, \"Tippecanoe\" remained in the haven at Efate. On 8 May, she got underway and, for a time, joined Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's recently arrived TF 16—built around carriers and . She stopped at Noumea on 11 May and then continued on to Samoa, reaching Tutuila on 24 May. Four days later, she put to sea to return to Hawaii and entered Pearl Harbor on the 30th. On 1 July, she left Oahu to conduct nearly a month of operations with TF 18 before returning on the 26th.\n\n\"Tippecanoe\" departed Pearl Harbor on 9 August 1942 and reached Alaskan waters on the 15th to begin three years in the frigid northern latitudes of the Pacific. For the remainder of the war, she steamed the resupply circuit between such ports as Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Adak, Akutan, Cold Bay, and Attu and made periodic voyages south to Seattle and San Francisco to replenish. In May 1943, she supported the invasion of Attu, but from a safe distance in port at Adak. By the latter part of the summer, the Aleutians had been secured, and her travels among the American bases in the area became routine.\n\nOn 15 August 1945, when hostilities in the Pacific ceased, \"Tippecanoe\" was en route from Seattle to Dutch Harbor. After visits to Adak and Attu during the latter half of the month, the oiler headed for Japan for several months of duty supporting the occupation forces. She arrived at Ominato on 8 September and, after a month there, moved on to Tokyo. During her two remaining months in Japan, she visited Aomori, Yokohama, and Yokosuka. She departed Yokosuka on 28 November to return to the United States and entered San Francisco on 18 December. On 6 March 1946, \"Tippecanoe\" was decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Her disposal was authorized on 19 March, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 12 April. She was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 7 October and was sold to the National Metal & Steel Co. on 20 November 1946.\n\n\n"}

He is currently under contract with All Elite Wrestling under the ring name Soul Train Jones.\n\nAfter a standout amateur career, Jones started wrestling professionally as Soul Train Jones in the Championship Wrestling Association based in Memphis, Tennessee in 1985. He feuded with Chick Donovan and Big Bubba. He also made appearances in ICW with the Soul Train Jones gimmick.\n\nMoving to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), he first appeared as a jobber wrestling under the name Lucius Brown, losing a squash match to \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in Salisbury, MD on September 17, 1986.\n\nHe then went on to debut in the summer of 1987 as Virgil, the bodyguard for \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase. His stage name, thought up by Bobby Heenan, was meant as a jab against then-World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler and booker Virgil Runnels, better known as Dusty Rhodes. Virgil carried DiBiase's cash that he liked to flaunt and was the one who got beaten up while DiBiase ran away after a devious act against a face. He would also occasionally be used in a wrestling capacity against DiBiase's rivals to try and soften them up; he would lose matches to such names as Randy Savage, Hercules and Jake Roberts.\n\nVirgil was increasingly humiliated by DiBiase and eventually turned on him, hitting him with his own Million Dollar Title belt at the Royal Rumble in January 1991, making him a fan favorite. After befriending and training with Roddy Piper, he defeated DiBiase by count-out at WrestleMania VII and pinned him for the belt on August 26, 1991 at SummerSlam. He lost the belt back to DiBiase in November of that year as a result of outside interference by the Repo Man. At the This Tuesday in Texas PPV, Repo Man and DiBiase defeated Virgil and Tito Santana.\n\nAt WrestleMania VIII, Virgil teamed with Big Boss Man, Sgt. Slaughter, and Jim Duggan to defeat The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), Repo Man, and The Mountie. Virgil pinned Knobs following a heel miscommunication. He would then primarily be used to put over numerous rising talents, losing to Nailz at SummerSlam and Yokozuna at Survivor Series. However, he did receive a shot at Bret Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship on the November 21, 1992 episode of \"WWF Superstars\". After a valiant effort, Virgil submitted to Hart's Sharpshooter. After the match, the two shook hands out of respect. Virgil then remained in the undercard, losing to Johnny Polo on a tour of Ontario in November 1993.\n\nVirgil's last appearance on a PPV event was the 1994 Royal Rumble where he was a late substitute for Kamala. His last notable feud was with a returning Nikolai Volkoff in the Summer of 1994. However he continued to perform on television and on the house show circuit for the WWF until he was released that August.\n\nHe was booked per appearance in May 1995 in house show matches against Jean-Pierre LaFitte.\n\nFollowing two years on the independent scene, he appeared in WCW as Vincent in 1996, where he was the \"Head of Security\" for the nWo. His name was meant to be a mockery of WWF owner Vince McMahon. His role was originally meant for Charles Wright and WCW had verbally agreed to a contract with Wright, but signed Jones instead, reportedly after Jones offered to work for less than Wright.\n\nJones had minor success when first arriving, winning a few matches on the low profile \"WCW Saturday Night\". Rarely wrestling, he often valeted nWo members such as Scott Norton and Scott Steiner. Jones, like his role in the WWF, would again take the brunt of the beatings as other nWo members scurried away. Vincent's first PPV match with WCW was at Starrcade 1997, when he teamed with Scott Norton and Randy Savage to defeat The Steiner Brothers and Ray Traylor. His next match on pay per view came in November 1998, when he competed in the World War 3 Battle Royal, unsuccessfully. He was part of the nWo Hollywood faction when the stable split and he was one of the last members of the nWo when it dissolved in 1999.\n\nVincent's only WCW singles match on pay per view came at Uncensored 1999 when he was on the losing end of a Harlem Street Fight against his nWo Black and White partner Stevie Ray. During the 'Powers That Be' angle in fall of 1999, Jones was renamed Shane, a reference to WWF owner Vince McMahon's son Shane McMahon. During this time Jones teamed with Curt Hennig and the Harris Brothers (known briefly as Creative Control), doing Vince Russo's bidding. In late 1999, he joined The West Texas Rednecks under the name of Curly Bill, but the faction split shortly after. His last role for the company saw him managing Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller under the name Mr. Jones, but he was soon replaced by a valet named Ms. Jones. He would then go on to compete under his real name, Mike Jones, for the remainder of his days in WCW.\n\nFollowing his departure from WCW, he retired from wrestling, and worked as a high school math teacher in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In April 2006, Jones toured Asia at different US Military installations as part of the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation program for soldiers stationed overseas. He wrestled as Vincent of the nWo against one of the Ballard Brothers dressed as Doink the Clown in the second to last match during this tour. On November 28, 2008, Jones returned to the ring as \"Virgil\" and wrestled for Next Era Wrestling in Lockport, NY, in a tag match with Patrick O'Malley, defeating Ryot and Superbeast. He then appeared at a Total Nonstop Action show.\n\nShortly prior to January 31, 2009 in Manchester, England, Virgil had produced a promo for UK fan convention WrestleSlam 2 calling out Liverpool independent wrestler The Vulture for a proposed 'shoot'. However, when The Vulture arrived at the event, Virgil instead offered him a T-shirt. On July 2, 2009, Jones returned to the ring, once again, in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, as Virgil, this time for Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW). On April 5, 2019, Virgil, dressed as the character Starman from NES \"Pro Wrestling\", appeared for Joey Janela's Spring Break 3, where he defeated Ethan Page.\n\nOn the May 17, 2010 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Jones returned to WWE reprising his Virgil bodyguard character, this time with Ted DiBiase, Jr. He carried out all of his old actions, such as holding the ropes open for DiBiase and bringing him a microphone when asked. On the June 14 episode of \"Raw\", Virgil and DiBiase were in a tag team match against Big Show and Raw guest host Mark Feuerstein. After Virgil got pinned and lost the match, DiBiase stuffed a $100 bill in Virgil's mouth and walked out on him. The following week DiBiase first apologized to Virgil, but then fired him and replaced him with Maryse.\n\nOn the November 6, 2019 episode of \"AEW Dynamite\", Virgil, under his old ring name of Soul Train Jones, appeared in a video package for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as an ally of Chris Jericho and The Inner Circle. On the November 27 episode of \"AEW Dynamite\", Jones started off the show by introducing Jericho for Chris Jericho's Thanksgiving Thank You Celebration for Le Champion, which was ultimately interrupted by SoCal Uncensored.\n\nAfter wrestling, Jones has been attending conventions and has been seen at subway stations selling autographs; as a result, since 2012, there have been \"Lonely Virgil\" memes created where fans posted pictures of him at conventions with nobody lining up. Lonely Virgil was originally created by Sam Roberts of the \"Opie and Anthony Radio Show\".\n\nIn 2014, Jones appeared in the Jason Michael Brescia film, \"Bridge and Tunnel\" as Kony, a neighborhood barfly. Jones was cast in the film after he met actor-producer Joe Murphy while selling autographs at Grand Central Station.

The treaty granted peace between the two, but also essentially guaranteed that Welsh self-rule would end upon Llewelyn's death and represented the completion of the first stage of the Conquest of Wales by Edward I.\n\nLlewelyn, wanting to cement his links to royalty more forcefully, sought to marry Eleanor de Montfort, daughter of Simon de Montfort and King Edward's cousin. They were married by proxy in 1275, but when Eleanor sailed from France to meet Llewelyn, Edward hired pirates to seize her ship; she was imprisoned at Windsor Castle.\n\nEdward, who was newly acceded to the throne of England, viewed Llewelyn as a threat, and particularly disliked the idea of his marrying the daughter of de Montfort, who had been the biggest threat to his royal predecessor's reign. Edward also summoned Llewelyn to appear before him on several occasions, which Llewelyn refused on the grounds that he was not safe at Edward's court.\n\nIn 1276, Edward declared Llewelyn a rebel and gathered an enormous army to march against him. By the summer of 1277, Edward's forces had reached the heart of Gwynedd. Edward's men confiscated the harvest in Anglesey, which deprived Llewelyn and his men of food, forcing Llewelyn to surrender.\n\nWhat resulted was the treaty of Aberconwy, which guaranteed peace in Gwynedd in return for several difficult concessions from Llewelyn, including confining his authority to lands west of the River Conwy, while lands east were granted to his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd, with whom he had earlier fought for control of Wales. Llewelyn was not stripped of his recently proclaimed title, Prince of Wales — but most of the lesser Welsh rulers who had paid him fealty were no longer to recognize him as their lord. Once signed, Edward began building several fortresses along the approach to Gwynedd, at Aberystwyth, Builth, Flint and Rhuddlan. The Treaty was agreed 9 November 1277, ratified by Edward 10 November 1277.\n\nIn the years after the treaty, Llewelyn sought to consolidate what power he had left. He paid homage and tribute to Edward, who agreed to allow Llewelyn's marriage to go forward. In 1278, Llewelyn and Eleanor de Montfort were married in Worcester Cathedral, with Edward present at the nuptials.\n\n"}

Raised largely in an orphanage and by various relatives, Martin started out playing drums, then switched to C melody saxophone and subsequently tenor saxophone, the latter the one with which he would be identified. Early on, he had intended to become a journalist. He had hoped that he would earn enough money from his musical work to enter Ohio State University, but instead, he wound up becoming an accomplished musician. Martin led his own band while he was in high school, then played in various local bands. Freddy spent his spare time selling musical instruments; which also gave him an excuse to listen to the Lombardos play at the \"Music Box\". After working on a ship's band, Martin joined the Mason-Dixon band, then joined Arnold Johnson and Jack Albin. It was with Albin's \"Hotel Pennsylvania Music\" that he made his first recordings, for Columbia's Harmony, Velvet Tone, and Clarion 50-cent labels in 1930.\n\nAfter a couple of years, his skill began attracting other musicians. One was Guy Lombardo, who remained friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted a job at the H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. But, Lombardo got to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and Martin's career got started. But, the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.\n\nAt the Bossert Marine Room, Martin pioneered the \"Tenor Band\" style that swept the sweet-music industry. With his own tenor sax as melodic lead, Martin fronted an all-tenor sax section with just two brasses and a violin trio plus rhythm. The rich, lilting style quickly spawned imitators in hotels and ballrooms nationwide. \"Tenor bands\", usually with just the three tenors and one trumpet, could occasionally be found playing for older dancers well into the 1980s.\n\nThe Martin band recorded first for Columbia Records in 1932. As the company was broke and signing no new contracts, the band switched to Brunswick Records after one session and remained with that label till 1938. During his tenure at Brunswick/ARC, half of his recordings were issued on ARC's stable of budget priced labels (Banner, Conqueror, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo, and Vocalion) as well as scores of non-vocal takes issued on ARC's special theater use label, sold only to movie theaters as background music. In 1938, he signed with RCA Victor and was assigned to Bluebird. The band also recorded pseudonymously in the early 1930s, backing singers such as Will Osborne.\n\nMartin took his band into many prestigious hotels, including the Roosevelt Grill in New York City and the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. A fixture on radio, his sponsored shows included NBC's \"Maybelline Penthouse Serenade\" of 1937. For Martin, real success came in 1941 with an arrangement from the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B minor. Martin recorded the piece instrumentally, but soon lyrics were put in and it was re-cut as \"Tonight We Love\" with Clyde Rogers' vocal – becoming his biggest hit. It sold over one million copies by 1946, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.\n\nThe success of \"Tonight We Love\" prompted Martin to adopt several other classical themes (of Rachmaninoff, Grieg, and others), which featured the band's pianists Jack Fina, Murray Arnold, and Barclay Allen. In 1946 he recorded \"Dingbat the Singing Cat\" adapted from Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\", and later recorded \"A Lover's Concerto\", adapted from baroque composer Christian Petzold's \"Minuet in G major\", two decades before pop group The Toys released it. At this time, Martin enlarged the orchestra to a strength of six violins, four brasses, and a like number of saxes.\n\nHis band's first hits included \"Intermezzo\" and \"the Hut-Sut Song\".\n\nMartin was nicknamed \"Mr. Silvertone\" by saxophonist Johnny Hodges. Chu Berry named Martin his favorite saxophonist. He has also been idolized by many other saxophonists, including Eddie Miller. Although his playing has been admired by so many jazz musicians, Martin never tried to be a jazz musician. Martin always led a sweet styled band. Unlike most sweet bands that just played dull music, Martin's band turned out to be one of the most musical and most melodic of all the typical hotel-room sweet bands. According to George T. Simon, Martin's band was \"one of the most pleasant, most relaxed dance bands that ever flowed across the band scene.\"\n\nHe used the banner \"Music in the Martin Manner.\" Russ Morgan used a similar banner when he finally landed a radio series with his own band in 1936. (Morgan's title was \"Music in the Morgan Manner\".) Russ had been playing in Martin's band and the two were good friends for years. Morgan used some of Martin's arrangements when he started his band.\n\nMartin also had a good ear for singers. At one time or another, Martin employed Merv Griffin, Buddy Clark, pianists Sid Appleman and Terry Shand, saxophonist Elmer Feldkamp, Stuart Wade, violinist Eddie Stone, and many others. Helen Ward was a singer for Martin just before she joined Benny Goodman's new band.\n\nMartin's popularity as a bandleader led him to Hollywood in the 1940s where he and his band appeared in a handful of films, including \"Seven Days' Leave\" (1942), \"Stage Door Canteen\" (1943), and \"Melody Time\" (1948), among others.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Martin continued to perform on the radio and also appeared on TV. Untroubled by changing musical tastes, he continued to work at major venues and was musical director for Elvis Presley's first appearance in Las Vegas. Still in demand for hotel work, Martin entered the 1970s with an engagement at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, he was part of two tours of one-nighters that were known as \"The Big Band Cavalcade\". Among the other performers on the show were Margaret Whiting, Bob Crosby, Frankie Carle, Buddy Morrow, Art Mooney, and George Shearing. When the tours ended, Martin returned to the West Coast. In 1977, Martin was asked to lead Guy Lombardo's band when Lombardo was hospitalized with a heart condition.\n\nMartin continued leading his band until the early 1980s, although by then, he was semi-retired. Freddy Martin died on September 30, 1983, in Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, after suffering a second stroke. He was 76 years old.\n\nThe 1947 song \"Pico and Sepulveda\" was recorded by Martin under the alias of \"Felix Figueroa and his Orchestra\" and was frequently featured on Dr. Demento's syndicated radio show. It was also featured in the 1980 surrealist film \"Forbidden Zone\".\n\n\"Grieg Piano Concerto\" (Bluebird 11430) 1942\n\n"}

{"id": "2052999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052999", "title": "Augusta Canal", "text": "Augusta Canal\n\nThe Augusta Canal is a historic canal located in Augusta, Georgia, United States. The canal is fed by the Savannah River and passes through three levels (approximately total) in suburban and urban Augusta before the water returns to the river at various locations. It was devised to harness the water power at the fall line of the Savannah River to drive mills, to provide transportation of goods, and to provide a municipal water supply. It is the only canal in the US in continuous use for its original purposes of providing power, transport, and municipal water.\n\nThe Augusta Canal was initially completed in 1845 as a source of water, power, and transportation for the city of Augusta. It was one of the few successful industrial canals in the Southern United States. During the time of construction, the city's Canal Commission was headed by Henry Harford Cumming. Cumming personally paid railroad engineer John Edgar Thomson to conduct the initial survey for the project. In 1847, construction began on the first factory, a saw and gristmill at the present site of Enterprise Mill. The Augusta Manufacturing Company, a sprawling four-story textile \"manufactory\", soon followed. They would be the first of many factories built along the Augusta Canal.\n\nBy the time of the Civil War, Augusta was one of the few manufacturing centers in the South. The power and water transportation afforded by the canal were among the factors that led Confederate Col. George Washington Rains to select Augusta as the location for the Confederate Powderworks. The 28 buildings, which were the only ones designed, constructed, and paid for by the government of the Confederate States of America, stretched for along the Augusta Canal. Other war industries were established along or near the canal, making Augusta an important center for materiel.\n\nAs the Civil War moved into Georgia in 1864, there was fear that US General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops would move to attack Augusta and her massive gunpowder factory. But Sherman's march through the South left Augusta untouched. As a result, the city ended the war in reasonably better physical and economic condition than many Southern cities. The population had doubled and hard currency was available to finance recovery, including expansion of the canal.\n\nThe canal was enlarged in 1875. A boom era saw the construction of the Enterprise Mill, King Mill, and Sibley Mill, the Lombard Ironworks; many other plants opened or expanded. Many people who lived on farms moved to the city to work at the mills, including women and children. The factories led to the rise of mill villages in their precincts.\n\nIn the 1890s, the city replaced its old water pumping station with impressive structure at mid-canal that is still used by the city of Augusta today. As the electric age began to dawn, Augusta began to turn the canal's falling water power to drive the first electrical generation equipment. By 1892, Augusta boasted both electric streetcars and street lights — the first Southern city to have these amenities.\n\nFlooding was a big problem in Augusta during the early 20th century. Following major floods in the 1920s and 1930s, the Federal Works Progress Administration deployed hundreds of workers to make repairs and improvements, build a new spillway and to straighten the canal.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the canal came into a period of neglect. Textile factories began to close and the city's industrial activity began to shift south of the city. At one point in the 1960s, city officials considered draining the canal to build a superhighway.\n\nFlickers of interest in reviving the Augusta Canal began appearing in the 1970s. A state park was proposed, but never materialized. In 1989, the state legislature created the Augusta Canal Authority, the body that has jurisdiction over the canal today. In 1993, the Authority issued a comprehensive Master Plan, outlining the Canal's development potential. In 1996, the US Congress designated the Augusta Canal a National Heritage Area, the first such designation in Georgia.\n\nThe Augusta Canal Authority moved forward with its master plan. In 2003, the Augusta Canal Interpretive Center (now Discovery Center) opened in the revitalized Enterprise Mill. In late 2003 and early 2004, two modern-day Petersburg boats, inspired by the cargo vessels that once plied the canal with bales of cotton and farm goods, began operation for guided tours.\n\nThe King and the Sibley textile mills are now owned by the Augusta Canal Authority.\n\nThe canal is, along with four historic industrial areas, part of the Historic Augusta Canal and Industrial District, which was named a National Historic Landmark in 1977. It was also named a National Heritage Area by Congress in 1996, the first designated National Heritage Area in Georgia.\n\nThe Augusta Canal is a principal source of drinking water in Augusta and is a centerpiece of the city. It also has been a focus of redevelopment. Textile mills such as the Enterprise and Sutherland mills have been converted to upscale offices and loft apartments. New projects, such as the Kroc Center and Canalside Apartments have been constructed. Other developments such as Harrisburg Canal Village, and Augusta Canal Mill Village trailhead are proposed or under construction.\nThe canal is best known today for its recreational facilities, including daily guided tours on electric tour boats, paddling and kayaking, and for its multi-use trail. The towpath on the canal's first level forms a backbone for the recreational trail system, complemented by newer trails including the River Levee Trail, Third Level Trail, and the Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association (SORBA) single-track mountain bike trail.\n\nEnterprise Mill in Augusta is also site of the \"Augusta Canal Discovery Center at Enterprise Mill\"', (known as the Interpretive Center from 2003-2013.) The interactive museum details how the canal was built and how it works, hydroelectricity, the history of the mills along the canal and the life of mill workers, and the 20th century decline of the mills and the effects on the canal. Boat tours of the Canal start from the Discovery Center.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The change was intended to separate the administrative duties for the telephone system from the government's regulatory duties.\n\nIn 1999, SaskTel launched a new Yorkton, Saskatchewan-based subsidiary known as SecurTek, which deals in security and monitoring services.\n\nIn 2002, the company introduced a digital, IPTV-based television service known as Max Entertainment Services, as one of the first such offerings in Canada.\n\nIn 2009, SaskTel entered into network sharing agreements with Bell Canada and Telus to contribute to a national UMTS/HSPA+ cellular network. In July 2010, SaskTel announced an employee trial launch of its $170 million HSPA+ network. The services became publicly available August 16 in metropolitan areas such as North Battleford, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina, Saskatoon, Swift Current, Yorkton, and Weyburn. It launched with a range of BlackBerry and Nokia handsets, and the promise of iPhone carriage in the future.\n\nIn August 2012, SaskTel announced that it would construct a fibre to the home (FTTH) network branded as Infinet (stylized infiNET), beginning in portions of Regina and Saskatoon, and other cities over the next seven years. In January 2013, SaskTel announced the launch of an LTE network in the Regina and Saskatoon areas, with plans to extend coverage into other major areas of the province by 2014. As of 2013, the company had recorded nearly 616,000 wireless subscribers and over 100,000 Max TV subscribers.\n\nIn July 2015, SaskTel acquired six AWS-1 wireless spectrum licenses from Wind Mobile.\n\nIn 2016, Brad Wall's Saskatchewan Party government proposed Bill 40, which allowed for the partial privatization of up to 50% of a provincial crown corporation without seeking public approval. The bill prompted concerns that stakes in SaskTel could be sold to third-parties; the company conducted an independent assessment, factoring in the then-proposed acquisition of former crown telco MTS in Manitoba to Bell Canada. The review found that SaskTel's net income risked \"[being] unable to support the level of dividends that have been returned to the province in recent years\", citing the possibility of new or enhanced competition among other companies.\n\nWall promised that any sale of SaskTel shares would be subject to a public referendum; in August 2016, he stated that \"if we get an offer and we think it generates a significant amount of money for the province, maybe enough to eliminate our [$4.1 billion] operating debt, if it takes care of the jobs question in Regina, if it provides better coverage, we are at least going to take it to the people and we'll need someone to lead that process.\"\n\nIn May 2017, following the passing of Bill 40, it was reported that representatives of BCE Inc., Rogers Communications, and Telus had been lobbying and in discussions with Dustin Duncan, minister responsible for SaskTel. The company stated that the meetings were regarding ongoing wholesale agreements between the companies, and were unrelated to privatization.\n\nIn August 2017, Wall announced that he would repeal Bill 40.\n\nSaskTel shut down its CDMA network in July 2017. In August 2017, SaskTel announced that it would build FTTH in Rosthern, Saskatchewan (which lies between Saskatoon and Prince Albert). The deployment was part of a pilot program for deploying the service in portions of Saskatchewan's rural regions. It also launched a new suite of smart home and home security products in conjunction with SecurTek and Alarm.com.\n\nIn April 2018, SaskTel's directory division DirectWest expanded into out-of-home advertising through the purchase of digital billboards.\n\nIn May 2018, SaskTel announced a capital investment of $301 million into improvements to its services over the next year, with $61.2 million going towards FTTH deployment for 22,000 additional customers, $26.5 million on improvements to its wireless network, and $109.1 million into customer service.\n\nIn August 2018, SaskTel launched MaxTV Stream, a new skinny-bundle IPTV service, utilizing the Ericsson MediaFirst platform running as an app on Android TV boxes. On launch the service was available in all SaskTel FTTH markets, as well as 11 rural communities.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, SaskTel announced that all customers who have internet access will be migrated to electronic billing, in a process that began March 27.\n\nOn October 4, 2019, 5,000 Unifor workers representing seven Saskatchewan crown corporations, including SaskTel and two subsidiaries, went on strike. SaskTel stated that this strike would not affect service for its customers (including online billing and account management via the mySaskTel website), but that first-party SaskTel retail stores will be closed for the duration, and that customers would be unable to activate new home services or transfer them to new residences. After initially picketing outside of the Saskatchewan Party's convention, workers picketed outside of SaskTel's call centre in Regina on October 8—preventing managers from entering.\n\nThe same day, Unifor stated its intent to return to a work-to-rule action on October 8 without a new deal. However, SaskTel announced that it would not allow the unionized workers to return, as \"unknown and intermittent walkouts\" could compromise the quality of service (Unifor stated that it would only provide 24 hours' notice of any future walkout). In solidarity, the remaining employees in the strike (representing crown corporations such as SaskPower) chose to not return to work either.\n\nIn October 2019, SaskTel and Unifor reached a tentative agreement, pending ratification, and work by employees resumed on October 22, 2019. On November 15th, 2019, Unifor announced that the agreement was ratified by SaskTel employees.\n\nSaskTel is a sponsorship partner for the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders, and was named as a \"founding partner\" of the new Mosaic Stadium in Regina upon its opening in 2016. In August 2014, SaskTel acquired the naming rights to Saskatoon's Credit Union Centre, and renamed it SaskTel Centre. It is also title sponsor of the Saskatchewan Jazz Festival in Saskatoon.\n\nUntil 2016, SaskTel's marketing prominently featured characters based on the fairy tale \"Little Red Riding Hood\", including characters such as Red, the Wolf, and Gainer the goldfish. In December 2016, the company introduced a new branding campaign, \"Today is The Day\".\n\nThe company re-launched its anti-cyberbullying awareness campaign, \"I Am Stronger\", as \"Be Kind Online\" in February 2019.\n\n"}
