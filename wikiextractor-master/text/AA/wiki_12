Also known as the \"Zoo School\" because of its active partnership with the Minnesota Zoo and its 10-acre (48,000 m²) site on zoo property, the school embraces project-based learning with an environmental theme.\n\nThe School of Environmental Studies opened during 1996 in the Twin Cities suburb of Apple Valley as a public, 200-student, 11th and 12th grade \"high school of choice\". Students from Independent School District 196's high schools, Eastview High School, Apple Valley High School, Rosemount High School and Eagan High School, can all elect to attend SES. In addition, under Minnesota's open-enrollment option students from the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area are able to fill available slots on a year-by-year basis.\n\nThe school is the product of a collaboration between the state (Minnesota Zoo), the community (City of Apple Valley) and a public school district (ISD 196). Originally named the \"Zoo Environmental Learning Center (ZELC)\" the design and implementation reflects the work of a diverse group of educators. Teachers, administrators, environmental educators, architects and researchers all contributed to the initial discussions and final design of the school.\n\nSince it is located on the grounds of the Minnesota Zoo, a number of students work with zookeepers and scientific staff in studying animal behavior, keeping animals active and challenged, and promoting public transit to the zoo. Other partners who work actively with students to bring real-world experiences to the academic content include the Minnesota DNR, Dakota County GIS and Parks departments, the City of Eagan Parks department, and the City of Apple Valley.\n\nThe school's two-year program culminates with a series of senior capstone activities. As a rite of passage this program requires the students to initiate sustainable service experiences, proclaim their evolving environmental ethic, and present an environment issue of choice at a forum attended by the general public, family, and significant individuals in the student's life. Another innovation championed by this program includes their annual \"adventure learning activity \"Eco-Challenge\" conducted at nearby Lebanon Hills Regional Park located in Dakota County, Minnesota. It was conceived by earth science teacher Steve Meyer as the focus of his University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point Master's Thesis on \"team-based mentoring\".\n\nThe School of Environmental Studies was designed in a manner very different from most schools. The committee charged with planning SES conducted almost two years of research before commissioning an architect. What emerged was a clear vision of the kinds of learning experiences they hoped to provide: interdisciplinary, project-based, and real-world.\n\nArchitect Bruce Jilk was commissioned to design the school and given strict budgetary parameters: the per-pupil costs to build and operate the school could not exceed those of other high schools in the district. The result: a 68,000 square foot (6,300 m²) building, completed for $5,420,000, or $80 per square foot ($860/m²).\n\nThe central building block of Jilk's design is the student workstation (desk with bulletin board and storage area). This feature simultaneously meets two objectives: that students take on the role of workers (the workstation resembles an office cubicle) and that the learning environment promote a sense of identity (students can decorate workstations to reflect personal tastes).\n\nIndividual workstations are clustered in groups of 10, forming a \"pod.\" Ten pods form a \"house.\" The term \"house\" refers not only to the grouping of 100 students with three teachers but also to their common workspace: a large, flexible-use room (nearly half of one floor) with tables and partitions that can be arranged to accommodate small or large group work.\n\nArchitecturally, the \"heart\" of SES is a forum spanning two floors at the center of the building. Each of the school's four houses faces it and/or the adjacent library. Another example of flexible-use space, the forum serves as cafeteria, display center, gathering place, and auditorium, depending on how tables, chairs, and partitions are configured.\n\nMuch of the building's architecture is transparent and serves as a teaching tool. As an example, the exposed ductwork and air distribution systems allows students to construct a better understanding of issues of indoor air quality. Seniors examine the building's airflow during their investigations related to environmental health.\n\nDue to the school's offering of career courses, the building also features a room that caters to animal education, and a room that contains a professional recording studio.\n\nThe school is unique from other high schools in the district in that it offers a different range of classes. The core classes of English, social studies/Human Geography, and environmental science offered at SES are wrapped together in an interdisciplinary learning block of 180 minutes called house. During the balance of the day the school offers elective classes such as art, chemistry, physics, and mentorship. SES offers math classes from Algebra II to Advanced Placement Calculus. SES also has a language program, currently teaching Spanish. SES has a rotating block schedule in that there are two schedules that alternate day to day: Sky and Earth days. This allows students to take four electives, and also experience a class schedule closer to that of most colleges. Career Courses, such as Animal Care and Music Production, are also offered at school. These are a step above elective classes, and are designed for upperclassmen who are searching for a career to look into.\n\nHouse is a daily three-hour-long class where students learn about real topics relating to the environment. For the seniors, it is grounded in literature and composition, human geography, and environmental science, and for juniors, the topics of focus are in Literature and Writing, World History and Biology. There are two senior houses, Green and Gold, and two junior houses, Blue and Rose. Each house hosts independent events such as pot lucks, which create great community building times. These houses contain ten pods that are sectioned off by short walls, and a group area in the center of the pods, called a centrum. These pods consist of around ten students who each have their own desk. Advanced Placement classes are offered in conjunction with many house classes. These optional classes dive more deeply into many of the subjects merely introduced to students not opting for AP coursework .\n\nAt the end of each trimester the school offers an opportunity for students to participate in field studies. Field studies provide students with the ability to transfer classroom learning into the field. Field studies are student-funded, teacher-led activities lasting between 6 and 12 days in locations around the world. Some studies, such as the Winter Expedition, The American Outback, and the Spring BWCAW, focus on personal growth and wilderness settings. Others examine environments in distant parts of the world such as Alaska, Iceland, Glacier National Park, Scotland, Costa Rica, Belize, France, Spain, Southern California and others. Another type partners with Wilderness Inquiry to provide a more blended experience: New Zealand, Australia, South Africa.\n\nNear the end of each student's tenure at SES, seniors design a project that combines an aspect of the environment that they are passionate about with the community. Examples of senior projects in the past are a Peace Pole planted in the SES garden adorned with writing from languages spoken by citizens of countries SES students have visited. Another example is the Wind Turbine on SES property that gauges electricity levels and environmental factors.\n\n\n"}

In 1998 he left the PSC and founded the Citizens' Movement for Change (MCC). He was a Member of the European Parliament representing the French Community of Belgium for six terms from 1984 to 2009 and again from 2014 until 2019. He is the Delegate General of the European Democratic Party.\n\nDeprez studied philosophy, language and literature and added postgraduate studies in sociology. He worked as an assistant lecturer at the Catholic University of Louvain from 1966 to 1974 and did his doctorate at the same time.\n\nSubsequently, he went into politics, serving as adviser in the office of the Minister for French Culture for one year. Then he became political adviser to the president of the PSC. In 1979 he became the head of the Deputy Prime Minister's office. In 1981 he was elected president of the PSC and stayed for 15 years. In this capacity, he was a member of the European People's Party's policy bureau, as well. In 1984 he was elected to the European Parliament for the first time. In 1995, he was conferred the honorary title of Minister of State. In the same year, he announced his retirement as party leader.\n\nHis successor was, to Deprez' discontent, Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb. Deprez proposed to confederate the PSC with the Liberal Reformist Party (PRL), but could not convince his party colleagues. Therefore, he was edged out of the party and founded the MCC in 1998. He immediately forged an alliance of his new party with the PRL and the regionalist Democratic Front of the Francophones (FDF), which became the Reformist Movement (MR) in 2002 and of which Deprez has since been a vice-chairman. In 2004 he left the European Parliament's group of the European People's Party and joined the European Democratic Party and the parliamentary group Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).

In 1839, he left Europe to make collections on the Caribbean island of Cuba, where he lived ever since. During a short trip to Puerto Rico, at the request of Jesuit fathers to offer assistance in the creation of a zoological collection, in 1868, when revolutionary activities were beginning in Cuba as well as Puerto Rico, he met with don Tomás Blanco, according to naturalist Dr. Agustin Stahl. A friend of Carl Wilhelm Leopold Krug, who served as German Vice Consul in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and who paid for some of Gundlach's travels, he visited Puerto Rico in 1873, leaving Havana on 4 June 1873 on the ship Manuela, arriving in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico on 13 June, staying in Puerto Rico for approximately six months. During that trip, Gundlach contributed to the founding of the Civil Institute for Secondary Learning or \"Instituto Civil de Segunda Enseñanza\". This institute was closed several months later, in keeping with the Spanish government's policy, expressed to the bishops of Santiago in Cuba and of San Juan, of limiting the opportunities for higher learning, both in Cuba as well as Puerto Rico. He subsequently travelled from Havana to Puerto Rico's west coast aboard the \"Marsella\" in September 1875. He remained in Puerto Rico for approximately one year during that trip. While he was there, he changed his name from \"Johannes Christoph\" to its Spanish equivalent \"Juan Cristóbal\". He wrote the first major work on the birds of Cuba, \"Ornitología Cubana\", and his name is recorded in the scientific names of over sixty species. His collections passed into the care of the Museo Poey in Havana, named after Cuban intellectual Dr. Felipe Poey y Aloy (1799–1891), upon his death in 1896.\n\nIn 1986, on the 90th anniversary of his death, Cuba issued a series of postal stamps commemorating Gundlach.\n\nHis visits to Puerto Rico were considered so important to the development of the study of natural sciences in Puerto Rico that he is considered \"the Father of Natural Sciences in Puerto Rico\" and his portrait, painted by Andrés Garcés, hangs in the School of Natural Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras campus. To honor him, Dr. Agustín Stahl named a species of the cupey tree in his honor as \"Clusia gundlachi\". The Puerto Rico Academy of Arts and Sciences on June 26, 2008, awarded recognitions that carry Gundlach's name to 25 prominent scientists in Puerto Rico.\n\nHe wrote \"Contribucion á la Erpetologia Cubana\" (1880) and \"Contribucion á la entomologia Cubana\" in 4 volumes (1881–1884).\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated on the river Danube on the border with Serbia. While being a municipality in its own right, Borovo is closely related with neighboring Vukovar, to which it is physically connected. It is a biggest settlement in Croatia in which Serbs of Croatia constitute ethnic majority.\n\nThe municipality is located on the Danube river, the second longest European river. The municipality has a total area of 28,17 km (10.8 sq mi). The territory of the municipality is almost completely flat as it is located in Pannonian Plain, and it consist of fertile black soil adequate for the agricultural production of crops. Borovo is closely related with neighboring Vukovar, to which it is physically connected. It is connected by the D519 road to the rest of the country. Along its Danube bank municipality is bordering neighboring Republic of Serbia.\n\nTo the north it is bordered by the village of Dalj in Erdut municipality in Osijek-Baranja County, to the west the Trpinja municipality, to the south the town of Vukovar and its Borovo Naselje district and to the east the Danube river. About 30% of the entire territory of the municipality consists of residential area.\n\nBorovo Municipality has been inhabited since the Stone Age. In the younger Iron Age this region was settled by the Celts. During Roman times area was a part of Danubian Limes. Several villages and the only crossing over the Danube in the entire empire existed in this area. The village of Borovo itself was mentioned for the first time in the year 1231 when it was a property of the town of Vukovar in the Kingdom of Hungary. At that time village was centered more to the north from its present-day location. At that time village was centered more to the north from its present-day location. Around 1540 Borovo was populated by Serbs who originated from the upper Drina and Polimlje. This migration caused linguistic change in the region since the local Ikavian pronunciation of the vowel Yat in Shtokavian dialect was changed with the Ekavian pronunciation. The Church of St Stephen the Archdeacon was built in the period between 1761 and 1764. At that time Borovo gained municipality status for the first time in its history. Municipality was administrated by local knez. In 1736 there was 49 houses in the entire village. Until 1811 this number increased to 231 of them. At that time Borovo had a population of 1754 inhabitants. In 1880 Borovo became the gain the municipality status for the second time and this municipality created a coat of arms in 1884 used by the modern day municipality as well.\n\nBorovo became an important regional industrial center during the existence of Yugoslavia. In the period between the two world wars, Czech entrepreneur Jan Baťa's factory Bata Shoes opened one of their major factories in Borovo creating the economic growth after the crisis that followed the end of World War I. At that time, as the result of the development of business, modern day Borovo Naselje was built up. The village itself rise from 2213 inhabitants in 1932 to 4530 in 1936. In 1935 Borovo even included and airfield and Yugoslav airliner Aeroput connected the town with regular flights to Belgrade and Zagreb. In that time Borovo became municipality for the third time in its history.\n\nIn 1945 Borovo footwear was nationalized. While being state owned factory managed entirely by its employees through the Yugoslav workers' self-management system. The company produced everything from shoe polish to shoeboxes and was selling its products across the former Yugoslavia through the 620 local Borovo shops. Company was producing around 23 million pairs of shoes a year in that period.\n\nBattle of Borovo Selo on 2 May 1991 was one of the first armed clashes in the conflict which became known as the Croatian War of Independence. The immediate cause for the confrontation was a failed attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The unauthorized effort by four Croatian policemen resulted in the capture of two by a Croatian Serb militia in the village. To retrieve the captives, Croatian authorities deployed additional police, who drove into an ambush. Twelve Croatian policemen and one Serb paramilitary were killed in the battle before the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) intervened and stopped the fighting. Croatian independence referendum was called on 19 May 1991 while Serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. On June 25, 1991, at the same day as the Socialist Republic of Croatia declared its withdrawal from Yugoslavia, a self-proclaimed Serbian Autonomous Oblast SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was established. In 1992, the oblast joined the breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina. After the fall of Republic of Serbian Krajina rump Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia remained as a short-lived Serb parallel entity. After the Erdut Agreement, the territory was reintegrated into Croatia within UN peacekeeping mission UNTAES. On 22 of May 1997 Borovo Municipality was established for a fourth time. It became one of the founding municipalities of a Joint Council of Municipalities.\n\nAccording to 2011 Census Borovo had a population of 5,056 at the time. 89.73% of the population of municipality were ethnic Serbs (4,537 individuals). Second largest ethnic group were Croats (332) and there was also number of individuals who declared as follows: Ukrainians (8), Slovenians (2), Slovaks (23), Pannonian Rusyns (10), Russians (2), Romani (12), Poles (2), Germans (4), Macedonians (2), Hungarians (22), Czechs (3), Montenegrins (11), Bosniaks (14), Albanians (5) and others. About 100 individuals from younger generation left the village since the end of the war in search for a job in countries such as England, Norway, Australia and Canada.\n\nSerbian Language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet is the second official language in the municipality of Borovo alongside with the Croatian language which is official at the national level. Both Serbian and Croatian language are standardized varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. According to the municipal Statute, individuals who are members of the Serbian national minority are ensured the freedom of expression of national belonging and freedom to use their language and script in public and private use on the whole territory of the Municipality of Borovo. The statute guarantees that the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet will be used in the same font as Latin alphabet in text of the local seals and stamps, on official plates of public representative, executive and administrative bodies, as well as on those of legal persons with public authorities. For the coming and from the past sessions of the Municipal Assembly Councillor or any other citizen have the right to get all of the working and official materials bilingually, and those materials must be in the same font in both languages. According to the municipal Statute, on the entire territory of the Municipality bilingual signs of same font are used for written traffic signs and other written traffic markings, street and squares names and names of settlement and geographical localities. Equal public use of Serbian language is required on the basis of Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia and relevant national laws since the country is a party to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nThe Municipality of Borovo is one of seven Serb majority member municipalities within the Joint Council of Municipalities, inter-municipal sui generis organization of ethnic Serb community in eastern Croatia established on the basis of Erdut Agreement. As Serb community constitute majority of the population of the municipality it is represented by 2 delegated Councillors at the Assembly of the Joint Council of Municipalities, double the number of Councilors to the number from Serb minority municipalities in Eastern Croatia.\n\nThe municipality assembly is composed of 15 representatives. Assembly filled in by members of the electoral lists that win more than 5% of votes. Dominant party in the municipality since the independence of Croatia and the reintegration of the region in 1998 is Independent Democratic Serb Party. 1,475, or 36.16%, out of 4,079 voters participated in 2017 Croatian local elections with 93.69% valid votes. With 93.42% and 1,378 votes, Zoran Baćanović from Independent Democratic Serb Party was elected as municipality major. Since a proportional number of ethnic Croats was not elected, one additional MP was appointed.\n\nSummary of the 2017 Croatian local elections\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Votes\n!Seats\n\nBorovo is underdeveloped municipality which is statistically classified as the First Category Area of Special State Concern by the Government of Croatia. Croatian War of Independence and transformation from socialist economic system into capitalism lead to deindustrialization in the Borovo municipality. Huge part of the population reoriented themselves to the work in agriculture while the smaller section started small private businesses.\n\nElementary School in Borovo was open in 1853. In 1936, the new building was officially opened under the name of \"State Folk School of Knight King Alexander First Unifier\".\n\nAt the time of opening of new building the school in Borovo school was the largest one in Vukovar. After the World War II the school's name was changed once again, this time to Božidar Maslarić Elementary School. Following the Erdut Agreement, the school changed its name yet once again in 1997 and is known today simply as the Borovo Elementary School. In 2006, the school was thoroughly renovated from the European Union and Croatian government funds.\n\nSerbian Orthodox Church of St. Stephen in Borovo was completed in 1764. Church is listed in Register of Cultural Goods of Croatia. Iconostasis with 49 icons and other inventory is also specifically listed in Register.\n\nIn the village there is a Borovo volunteer fire department.\n\nOne of the three Serbian radio stations in the region called Radio Borovo, was formed in 1991.\n\nFudbalski klub Sloga is a football club established in 1926. In that year, group of sailors from a Czech boat on Danube broth the first ball in the village and the first football match was played by sailors and a group of locals. The local club was established shortly after. In 1947 match with Špart from Beli Manastir took place on a day of annual local celebration and fair. In the summer of 1950 Sloga's guest was FK Partizan. Partizan won the match with the result 10-0. On a return match at the Partizan Stadium result was 3:1 for Partisan. Two years after Partizan, Red Star Belgrade was Sloga's guest as well. Sloga lost the match with the result 8:1. Jovica Sremac Punoš was a club's player that played in Serbian First League in 1939/1940 season, just before World War II. Nikola Perlić was one of the Sloga's players. In 2016 90th anniversary of the club was organized with FK Vojvodina coming as a guest team for a friendly match. General Consul of Serbia in Vukovar Nataša Kelezić, Milorad Pupovac, Mile Horvat, Vojislav Stanimirović and Dragan Crnogorac attended the match. Vojvodina won the match with the result 6:0.

The louvres are joined onto a track so that they may be tilted open and shut in unison to control airflow, usually by turning a crank.\n\nJalousie is the French word for jealousy. It originated in 18th century France from the Italian word \"geloso\", which means jealous, or screen, as in to screen something from view. Supposedly because of their slatted louvres, jalousie windows protect the interior of the house from jealous peering eyes. However, the origin of Jalousie dates back to the mid-18th century, derived from the French word “Jealousy” – permitting one to see without being seen.\n\nA patent for a basic louvered window was applied for in the US by a Joseph W. Walker, of Malden, Massachusetts, in 1900 and issued November 26, 1901, as patent no. 687705. A popular hand-cranked glass, aluminum, and screen window combination was later designed by American engineer Van Ellis Huff and found widespread use in temperate climates before the advent of air-conditioning. Jalousie windows were a popular feature in Mid-century modern houses, especially those built in warm and humid climates.\nJalousie windows maximize natural ventilation by allowing airflow through the entire window area. Historically made only of wooden slats or glass panes, they are well suited to mild-winter climates. With mass production they became very common throughout homes in mid-20th-century Florida, Hawaii, southern California, the deep South, and Latin America. In cooler regions they were rapidly adopted to porches and sunrooms. They were also widely used in mobile homes during the 1950s and 1960s before most manufacturers began switching to sliding and sash windows in subsequent decades. Modern jalousie windows may be high-performance architectural windows, and some have even been featured in buildings which received awards for excellence in residential design and sustainable living.Jalousie windows have evolved over time and these days can be seen as a design element as well as a technical device to utilize natural ventilation and temperature control. They are also used more widely in commercial projects.\n\nA commonly accepted advantage of jalousie windows is their ability to be left part-way open in heavy rains as a way to maintain desirable ventilation, whether a sunshower or prolonged tropical storm. An experiment in 1960 tested the efficacy of jalousie windows in tropical climates to exclude rain while still allowing for air flow. A major issue with excluding rain while allowing air flow is that both tend to come from the same direction. The angled slatted jalousie windows give the impression of solving this issue, however, the actual efficacy of the windows to let in air while keeping out water was deemed unsatisfactory by the study's authors. \n\nJalousie windows also have several other drawbacks. Traditional style jalousie windows offer poor overall resistance to water penetration and drafts and are difficult to positively secure, as their slats are easily and silently removed. In addition to the inability to keep out water, they do not provide a secure barrier to keep air conditioned air inside. Also, the metal parts which make up the windows moving mechanism are prone to corrosion in humid environments, leading to damage such as broken or missing cranks. Jalousie windows are objects of scorn for many Floridians, as the windows are unable to keep out human and insect home invaders. \n\nModern manufacturers have improved their designs of jalousie windows to address these problems. Many market their products as having greater security and energy efficiency compared to earlier versions. The Australian company Breezeway, which began producing jalousie windows in 1935, is currently marketing jalousies which they claim creates an airtight seal when closed to keep out water and insects while keeping in air conditioned air. Breezeway brand jalousies are made with non-corrosive hardware and a pinning system which keeps the slats secured from the interior of the house to increase security and prevent the slats from falling out. They are currently the only jalousie window in the United States certified to withstand a Category 5 Hurricane.\n\nMany companies manufactured jalousie windows during the 20th century, and there are multiple surviving examples of advertisements from this period which demonstrate how the windows were marketed to consumers. The advertisements tended to stress how jalousie windows provide ventilation, privacy, rain-proofing, and an extra room in winter. Companies like StormMaster claimed their jalousies provided \"winter warmth and summer comfort.\" Others, like Ludman WindoTite, promoted their product by declaring how the brand's windows have \"transformed the Jones' front porch,\" which is an unambiguous reference to the concept of Keeping up with the Joneses. The VentVue company took a different approach to their advertising copy, instead stressing how their jalousies make \"every window a picture window,\" and states that they are fashionable choice for new constructions and replacements.\n\n"}

So all members of the Long Parliament were summoned by King Charles to assemble for a session of Parliament to be held at Christ Church Hall, Oxford. Eighty-two peers, which was most of the House of Lords, and 175 commoners, which was about one-third of the House of Commons, heeded the summons and came. Sir Sampson Eure was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nThe Parliament met a number of times during the English Civil War and was seen by Charles as a way of raising revenue. However, some of the members defected back to Westminster because they did not like his alliance with Irish Catholics, and others argued strongly for a negotiated peace with the Long Parliament in Westminster Hall.\n\nThe first session lasted from 22 January 1644 until 16 April 1644. The second session was from 8 October 1644 until 10 March 1645.\n\nNot much is known of its proceedings because all its records were burnt just before Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces in 1646.\n\n\n"}

This was the final serial to be broadcast in 45-minute episodes; this format would return 20 years later when the series resumed in 2005.\n\nThe TARDIS lands on Necros, the location of the funeral home Tranquil Repose. The Sixth Doctor is attacked by a mutant, which Peri kills. Before he dies, the mutant tells the Doctor that the Great Healer used him as a genetic experiment and his appearance and hostility were a result of the experiments.\n\nAt Tranquil Repose, a disc jockey plays songs and chats to entertain those who are in suspended animation. A couple, Natasha and Grigory, have illegally entered Tranquil Repose, looking for the man the Doctor is seeking – Arthur Stengos, Natasha's father. Upon finding his assigned suspended animation capsule, they discover it is empty. Shocked, they find a dark room filled with pulsating brains and other experiments. Grigory walks past a Glass Dalek casing with a mutating red creature inside it. Natasha realises it is the head of her father, and he is being metamorphosised into a Dalek.\n\nKara, who owns a company that distributes food, is a pawn of the Great Healer, in reality Davros. To dissolve this arrangement, she has hired the mercenary Orcini and his squire, Bostock. Orcini accepts the contract for the honour of killing Davros.\n\nArthur Stengos, who is now a head with red flesh growing over him, explains to Natasha and Grigory that the brains of everybody in Tranquil Repose are being used to metamorphosise into new Dalek mutants. He orders his daughter to kill him before he fully mutates. Natasha does, and then she and Grigory are captured and questioned by Takis and Lilt who are in charge of security.\n\nThe Doctor and Peri are met by Mr. Jobel and his subservient assistant Tasambeker. The Doctor sends Peri off with Jobel to meet the DJ while he digs into the situation. Orcini destroys a Dalek, and Davros is notified. He is convinced Kara has sent assassins, so he deploys Daleks to bring her to him. Tasambeker, who has been coerced by Davros to spy on Jobel, attempts to warn the Chief Embalmer out of misplaced love for him. When Jobel spurns her offer, Tasambeker fatally stabs him with a syringe. She is then exterminated by Daleks.\n\nThe Daleks capture the Doctor and throw him into a cell with Natasha and Grigory. They are then rescued by Orcini.\n\nOrcini and Bostock arrive at Davros's lab. They attempt to kill Davros but fail, and Bostock is killed by a Dalek. Kara is then brought in, Orcini betrays her motives to Davros. Orcini stabs Kara to death for lying to him, making good on an earlier threat if she was dishonest about her motives.\n\nNatasha and Grigory fail to destroy the brains scheduled for metamorphosis and are killed by a Dalek. The Doctor tells Peri to hail the President's ship. Overhearing the transmission, Davros orders Peri captured. The Doctor rushes to save her but is also caught. Both are taken to Davros' laboratory, where he reveals that he has created a new army of Daleks.\n\nDaleks loyal to the Dalek Supreme arrive from Skaro, called by Takis who now realises what has been going on. Takis leads the grey Skaro Daleks to Davros' laboratory, where they are met by cream and gold Necros Daleks who are loyal only to Davros. A battle ensues, during which Davros' only usable hand is shot off by Orcini. The grey Daleks then take Davros to Skaro to stand trial. \n\nThe wounded Orcini wants to detonate his bomb before Davros's ship leaves and refuses to use a timer. The Dalek ship takes off before the blast, however, but the Doctor states that Orcini died for something honourable: the destruction of Davros's new Daleks.\n\nTakis complains to the Doctor that they are now all out of a job. The Doctor tells him that they can harvest the flowers that grow on the planet and use them as a new food source.\n\nEric Saward got around the BBC's policy against script editors commissioning stories from themselves by writing the script during a six-week period between his contracts. Saward was on holiday on Rhodes at the time and many of the names (such as Lilt and Orcini) come from places, products, and people he encountered there. The story is loosely based on the book \"The Loved One\". \n\nDespite the text on the DVD release stating that \"Soylent Green\" was an influence on \"Revelation of the Daleks\", Eric Saward has said in the DVD commentary that he had not seen \"Soylent Green\" when he wrote it.\n\nEric Saward thought up the idea of blue 'mourning' suits for Necros in order to cover up Colin Baker's costume, which he considered inappropriate for a drama series. His was the final \"Doctor Who\" serial to be produced using film for outdoor sequences and video for interior scenes. Beginning with \"The Trial of a Time Lord\", production moved to all-video. Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant appear entirely on film in Part One and have no interaction with the actors in the video segments.\n\nEleanor Bron appeared in a brief scene in the earlier serial \"City of Death\" (1979) alongside John Cleese as art critics in Denise Rene's art gallery in Paris. She also appeared in a \"Doctor Who\" radio drama, \"Loups-Garoux\" (2001), in which she played the wealthy heiress Ileana de Santos.\n\nColin Spaull later appeared in the Tenth Doctor story \"Rise of the Cybermen\"/\"The Age of Steel\" (2006). Clive Swift later appeared in the Tenth Doctor episode \"Voyage of the Damned\" (2007) as Mr. Copper.\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC 2 in March/April 1993 on consecutive Fridays (19 March 1993 to 9 April 1993) in its 4-part version (sold for overseas transmissions) to represent the Colin Baker years in a series of repeats featuring the original seven Doctors. The episodes achieved viewing figures of 1.71, 1.8, 1.65 and 1.2 million respectively. The scene where Jobel is stabbed to death with a hypodermic needle was one of several violent scenes that caused controversy during this era of \"Doctor Who\". Australasian \"Doctor Who\" Fan Club president Tony Howe listed Jobel's death as one of several instances of \"sick, shock violence like Andy Warhol's\" that was present for \"cheap shock value only\".\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), saying that it \"looks wonderful and the plot is just about consistent and straightforward.\" They praised guest stars William Gaunt and Alexei Sayle, as well as how the Sixth Doctor \"finally gets to be Doctorish, with proper doses of compassion.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker also were positive, praising the guest stars, and reprinted positive fan reviews from the time. They did note that some viewers may not have liked the Doctor and Peri being sidelined, which could have resulted in the pace seeming slow. \n\nIn 2012, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" awarded the serial four stars out of five. He praised Graeme Harper's direction and called it \"Saward's most accomplished script\", though he felt it had a few structural problems. He also noted the amount of horror present, calling it a \"gruesome thrill-ride\". In \"Doctor Who: The Complete Guide\", Mark Campbell awarded it eight out of ten, describing it as \"an incredibly violent black comedy\". He added, \"Harper's direction is visceral, the actors are having a whale of a time and it's all held together by Roger Limb's spine-chilling music. The only thing missing is a plot.\"\n\nChristopher Bahn, reviewing the serial for \"The A.V. Club\", described it as \"a grim, depressing slog\", arguing that \"Saward is simply not a strong enough writer to pull this off, failing to provide the clever dialogue, well-thought-out underlying concepts or basic plot mechanics that might have made this work, and also apparently actively hostile to the notion that anyone in \"Doctor Who\", or watching it, should be having any fun.\" He felt that the subplots were not handled well and many ideas were thrown around but not explored. Despite this, he praised Terry Molloy's Davros, some of Sayle, and the realisation that Arthur Stengos was turned into a Dalek. DVD Talk's Stuart Galbraith was also not positive, giving the story two and a half out of five stars. He found the black humour misplaced and not funny, and criticised the use of Davros and the Doctor, except for the climax.\n\nVirgin Books (the successor to Target) announced plans to publish a novelisation by Saward in the early 1990s, but this ultimately did not occur. A fan group in New Zealand published an unofficial novelisation of the story in 1992, later republishing it online as an eBook titled \"Doctor Who: Revelation of the Daleks\". An official novelisation by Eric Saward was published by BBC Books 14 November 2019. A Target Books edition will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.\n\n\"Revelation of the Daleks\" was released in 1999 on VHS together with \"Planet of the Daleks\" in a special Dalek tin set, and again in 2001 as part another box set, the WHSmith exclusive, The Davros Box Set. The stories were released on VHS individually in North America, and later released on Region 2 DVD on 11 July 2005. \n\nAll home releases were digitally edited to remove the Jimi Hendrix Experience track \"Fire\" as played by the DJ, which was intact in original TV transmissions but cut from VHS and DVD releases due to copyright issues. For the VHS edition the soundtrack was edited to remove the Hendrix material leaving only the dialogue over which a piece of library guitar music was mixed loudly; for the DVD edition the original soundtrack was remixed to include another piece of library music with a flanging effect more sympathetic with that on the broadcast version.\n\nAn authoring error with Region 2 copies causes some makes of DVD player to freeze at around 8 minutes 32 seconds into episode one, unless certain precautions are taken.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1805104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805104", "title": "John Biddle (Unitarian)", "text": "John Biddle (Unitarian)\n\nJohn Biddle or Bidle (14 January 1615 – 22 September 1662) was an influential English nontrinitarian, and Unitarian. He is often called \"the Father of English Unitarianism\".\n\nBiddle was born at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. He studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, taking an M. A. in 1641. At the age of twenty-six, he became headmaster of the Crypt Grammar School, Gloucester. The school had links to Gloucester Cathedral, and since he was obliged to teach his pupils according to the Catechism of the Church of England, he immersed himself in the study of the Bible. He concluded from his studies that the doctrine of the Trinity was not supported by the Bible, and set about publishing his own views on the nature of God.\n\nHe was imprisoned in Gloucester in 1645 for his views, but released on bail. He was imprisoned again by Parliament in 1646 and, in 1647, while he was still a prisoner, his tract \"Twelve Arguments Drawn Out of Scripture\" was published. Henry Vane defended Biddle in the House of Commons, and he was released on bail in 1648. After a short while he was again imprisoned, in Newgate, where he remained until amnestied by the 1652 Act of Oblivion. Biddle and the MP John Fry, who had tried to aid him, were supported by the 1649 Leveller pamphlet \"Englands New Chaines Discovered\". Biddle was strongly attacked by John Owen.\n\nHe was again in trouble with the Parliament of 1654–55, which ordered his book \"A Two-fold Catechism\" seized. Motions were made against Biddle as a part of the Commons’ debate on the Instrument of Government’s provisions for religious liberty. They marked the moment when the house’s attempts to suppress sectarian radicalism faltered. Parliament was dissolved in January 1655, which ended the proceedings against Biddle, and he was released in May of that year. Biddle found himself in trouble only weeks later when the City Presbyterians decided to prosecute him using the Blasphemy Ordinance of 1648. This scared the sects (especially the Baptists) who, seeing a worrying precedent that could lead to them also being prosecuted, then rallied to his side. Oliver Cromwell exiled him to the Scilly Isles, out of the jurisdiction of any hostile English Parliaments. By exiling Biddle, Cromwell avoided a test case that could have put significant numbers of the sects at risk of prosecution. He was released in 1658. He was imprisoned once more, and became ill, leading to his death. His body was \"conveyed to the burial place joyning to Old Bedlam in Moorfields near London, was there deposited by the Brethren, who soon after took care that an altar monument of stone should be erected over his grave with an inscription thereon\".\n\nA biography of Biddle by Joshua Toulmin was published in 1789.\n\n\nHe is believed to have translated the Polish Racovian Catechism into English.\n\nHe denounced original sin, denied eternal punishment, and translated a mortalist tract. He condemned the Ranters. He affirmed that the Bible was the Word of God and his Christology appears to be Socinian, denying the pre-existence of Christ but accepting the virgin birth. Biddle's denial of the pre-existence of Christ was the main target of works including Puritan theologian John Owen's \"A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity\" (1669).\n\nBiddle's appeal for conscience was one of the major milestones of the establishment of religious freedom in England. More recently Biddle's combination of Socinian Christology and millennialism has led to a rediscovery of his work among Christadelphians and other non-Trinitarian groups in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1805105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805105", "title": "Bugatti Type 13", "text": "Bugatti Type 13\n\nThe Type 13 was the first true Bugatti car. Production of the Type 13 and later Types 15, 17, 22, and 23, began with the company's founding in 1910 and lasted through 1920 with 435 examples produced. Most road cars used an eight-valve engine, though five Type 13 racers had 16-valve heads, some of the first ever produced. The road cars became known as \"pur-sang\" (\"thoroughbred\") in keeping with Ettore Bugatti's feelings for his designs.\n\nThe car was brought back after World War I with a multi-valve engine to bring fame to the marque at Brescia. The production Brescia tourer also brought in much-needed cash.\n\nThe Bugatti automobile was prototyped as the Type 10 in Ettore Bugatti's basement in 1908 and 1909 while he was chief engineer at Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Cologne, Germany.\n\nThe Type 10 used a monobloc straight-four engine of Ettore's own design. it was an overhead cam unit with two valves per cylinder, which was highly advanced for the time. A very-undersquare design, it had a 60 mm bore and 100 mm stroke for a total of 1.1 L (1131 cc/69 in). This was attached to an open roadster body with solid axles front and rear. Leaf springs suspended the front with no suspension at all in the rear. Cables operated rear drum brakes.\n\nOn ending his contract with Deutz, Ettore loaded his family into the Type 10 and headed to the Alsace region, then still part of the German Empire, looking for a factory to begin producing cars of his own. After World War I, Alsace became a part of France again, and with it Bugatti.\n\nThe car was preserved and nicknamed \"\"la baignoire\"\" (\"the bathtub\") by the staff at Molsheim in later years due to its shape. Ettore restored it in 1939 and repainted it an orange-red color, earning it a new nickname, \"\"le homard\"\" (\"the lobster\"). It was moved to Bordeaux for the duration of World War II and remained there for decades before falling into private ownership. Today, the car is in California in the hands of a private collector.\n\nUpon starting operations at his new factory in Molsheim, Bugatti refined his light shaft-driven car into the Type 13 racer. This included boring the engine out to 65 mm for a total of 1.4 L (1368 cc/83 in). A major advance was the 4-valve head Bugatti designed — one of the first of its type ever conceived. Power output with dual Zenith Carburetters reached 30 hp (22 kW) at 4500 rpm, more than adequate for the 660 lb (300 kg) car. Leaf springs were now fitted all around, and the car rode on a roughly 2 m (79 in) wheelbase. Although having the appearance of a toy, the Bugatti Type 13 was successfully raced. It was seen at hillclimbs as early as 1910 looking rather out of place compared to the bulky and brutish competition. Where the Type 13 lacked in power, it made up in handling, steering and braking. These important elements were retained throughout all future Bugatti designs. Top speed was at 125 km/h.\n\nThe new company produced five examples in 1910, and entered the French Grand Prix at Le Mans in 1911. The tiny Bugatti looked out of place at the race, but calmly took second place after seven hours of racing.\n\nWorld War I caused production to halt in the disputed region. Ettore took two completed Type 13 cars with him to Milan for the duration of the war, leaving the parts for three more buried near the factory. After the war, Bugatti returned, unearthed the parts, and prepared five Type 13s for racing.\n\nThe Type 15 was a version of the Type 13 with a longer, 2400 mm (94.5 in), wheelbase. It had a six-sided radiator in front and semi-elliptic rear leaf springs.\n\nAnother version, the Type 17, was also produced. This used a 2550 mm (100.4 in) wheelbase. It shared its hexagonal radiator and rear springs with the Type 15.\n\nThe Type 15 was updated in 1913 as the Type 22. It had a larger roadgoing body, an oval radiator, and quarter-circle springs.\n\nA two-valve version of the Type 17 with a boat-tail body was built in 1913 as the Type 23. It also had the oval radiator of the Type 22.\n\nA Grand Prix for Voiturettes at Le Mans was the only French event of 1920, and Bugatti entered the two completed cars from Milan and one more from the remaining parts. Ettore's illegal act of placing a hand on the radiator cap during the race brought disqualification to the leading car, however.\n\nThe Type 13 was unbeatable. Bugatti's cars finished in the top four places at the Brescia Grand Prix in 1921, and orders poured in. Capitalizing on this victory, all subsequent four-valve Bugatti models bore the \"Brescia\" moniker.\n\nThese were the only Bugatti models to locate the carburettor on the left hand side of the engine and the exhaust on the right. Front wheel brakes were added in 1926.\n\nBugatti capitalized on the racing success of the Type 13 \"Brescia\" with the full-production post-war Brescia Tourer'. It used the multi-valve Brescia engine, and 2,000 examples were built from 1920 through 1926, making it the first full-production multi-valve car ever made.\n\n"}

He was made a Marshal of the Empire in 1807 by Napoleon.\n\nHe was born at Lamarche in the Vosges in 1764, son of Charles Perrin and wife Marie Anne Floriot, paternal grandson of Charles Perrin and wife Gabrielle Guerin, born in 1696, and great-grandson of Pierre Perrin and wife Anne Louvière. At the age of 17 he enlisted in the artillery regiment in Grenoble as a private soldier, and after ten years' service he applied for and received his discharge because of his disgust at the manners revolutionary army and settled at Valence. Soon afterwards he joined the local volunteers, and distinguishing himself in the war on the Alpine frontier, in less than a year he had risen to the command of a battalion. In Drôme, Valence, on 16 May 1791 he married Jeanne Josephine Muguet, by whom he had issue which was extinct in the male line by 1917.\n\nFor his bravery at the siege of Toulon in 1793 he was raised to the rank of général de brigade. He afterwards served for some time with the army of the Eastern Pyrenees, and in the Italian campaign of 1796–1799 he so acquitted himself at Mondovì, Rovereto and Mantua that he was promoted to be general of the division.\n\nAfter commanding for some time the forces in the department of Vendée, he was again deployed to Italy, where he performed well in service against the papal troops, and took an important part in the battle of Marengo. In 1802 he was made governor of the colony of Louisiana for a short time, in 1803 he commanded the Batavian army, and afterwards he acted for eighteen months (1805–1806) as French plenipotentiary at Copenhagen. \nIn that year he married for a second time in June at 's-Hertogenbosch to Julie Vosch van Avesaat (1781–1831), by whom he had an only daughter who died unmarried and without issue.\n\nOn the outbreak of hostilities with Prussia (the War of the Fourth Coalition) he joined the V Army Corps under Marshal Jean Lannes as chief of the general staff. He distinguished himself at the battles of Saalfeld and Jena, and at Friedland he commanded the I Corps in such a manner that Napoleon made him a Marshal of France.\n\nAfter the peace of Tilsit he became governor of Berlin, and in 1808 he was created duke of Belluno (the title was extinguished in 1853). In the same year he was sent to Spain, where he took a prominent part in the Peninsular War (especially against Blake at the Battle of Espinosa, and later at the battles of Talavera, Barrosa and Cádiz), until his appointment in 1812 to a corps command in the invasion of Russia. At first his corps was posted in the east Prussia but it was later moved up to Smolensk support the invading forces. from Here his most important service was in protecting the retreating army at the crossing of the Berezina River.\n\nHe took an active part in the wars of 1813–1814, until in February 1814 he arrived too late at Montereau-sur-Yonne. The result was a scene of violent recrimination and his supersession by the emperor, who transferred his command to Gérard. Thus wounded in his \"amour-propre\", Victor now transferred his allegiance to the Bourbon dynasty, and in December 1814 received from Louis XVIII the command of the second military division. In 1815, on the return of Napoleon from exile in Elba Victor accompanied the king to Ghent.\n\nWhen the second restoration followed the Battle of Waterloo he was made a peer of France. He became president of a commission which inquired into the conduct of the officers during the Hundred Days, and dismissed Napoleon's sympathizers. In 1821 he was appointed war minister and held this office for two years. In 1830 he was major-general of the royal guard, and after the July Revolution of that year he retired altogether into private life. He died in Paris on 1 March 1841. His papers for the period 1793–1800 have been published (Paris, 1846).\n\nHe married firstly in May 1791 Jeanne-Josephine Muguet and had four children:\n\nHe married secondly in June 1803 Julie Vosch van Avesaet (1781–1831) and had a daughter:\n\nVictor had mixed military talents. He was an excellent organizer and tactician. During his time in Spain he destroyed entire Spanish armies with Cannae like envelopments and even fought Wellington to a virtual tactical draw at Talavera. However he was a timid strategist often afraid of taking risks. Nevertheless, he recognized new developments in warfare and implemented them throughout his career. At the Beresina River in 1812, he made excellent use of reverse slope defenses showing that he learned something from Wellington. \n\nOn the contrary in his book “Napoleon and His Marshals” MacDonell calls Victor a stupid soldier. He claims the closest Victor ever came to victory is when he changed his name from Perrin into Victor. Dunn-Pattison says of him “Not specially dowered by fortune with talents for war” but does praise his courage and sense of honor. \n\n"}

{"id": "1805135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805135", "title": "Inequity aversion", "text": "Inequity aversion\n\nInequity aversion (IA) is the preference for fairness and resistance to incidental inequalities. The social sciences that study inequity aversion include sociology, economics, psychology, anthropology, and ethology.\n\nInequity aversion research on humans mostly occurs in the discipline of economics though it is also studied in sociology.\n\nResearch on inequity aversion began in 1978 when studies suggested that humans are sensitive to inequities in favor of as well as those against them, and that some people attempt overcompensation when they feel \"guilty\" or unhappy to have received an undeserved reward.\n\nA more recent definition of inequity aversion (resistance to inequitable outcomes) was developed in 1999 by Fehr and Schmidt. They postulated that people make decisions so as to minimize inequity in outcomes. Specifically, consider a setting with individuals {1,2...,\"n\"} who receive pecuniary outcomes \"x\". Then the utility to person \"i\" would be given by \n\nwhere α parametrizes the distaste of person \"i\" for disadvantageous inequality in the first nonstandard term, and β parametrizes the distaste of person \"i\" for advantageous inequality in the final term.\n\nFehr and Schmidt showed that disadvantageous inequity aversion manifests itself in humans as the \"willingness to sacrifice potential gain to block another individual from receiving a superior reward\". They argue that this apparently self-destructive response is essential in creating an environment in which bilateral bargaining can thrive. Without inequity aversion's rejection of injustice, stable cooperation would be harder to maintain (for instance, there would be more opportunities for successful free riders).\n\nJames H. Fowler and his colleagues also argue that inequity aversion is essential for cooperation in multilateral settings. In particular, they show that subjects in \"random income\" games (closely related to public goods games) are willing to spend their own money to reduce the income of wealthier group members and increase the income of poorer group members even when there is no cooperation at stake. Thus, individuals who free ride on the contributions of fellow group members are likely to be punished because they earn more, creating a decentralized incentive for the maintenance of cooperation.\n\nInequity aversion is broadly consistent with observations of behavior in three standard economics experiments:\n\nIn 2005, John List modified these experiments slightly to determine if something in the construction of the experiments was prompting specific behaviors. When given a choice to steal money from the other player, even a single dollar, the observed altruism all but disappeared. In another experiment, the two players were given a sum of money and the choice to give or take any amount from the other player. In this experiment, only 10% of the participants gave the other person any money at all, and fully 40% of the players opted to take all of the other player's money.\n\nThe last such experiment was identical to the former, where 40% were turned into a gang of robbers, with one catch: the two players were forced to earn the money by stuffing envelopes. In this last experiment, more than two thirds of the players neither took nor gave a cent, while just over 20% still took some of the other player's money.\n\nIn 2011, Ert, Erev and Roth ran a model prediction competition on two datasets, each of which included 120 two-player games. In each game player 1 decides whether to \"opt out\" and determine the payoffs for both players, or to \"opt in\" and let player 2 decide about the payoff allocation by choosing between actions \"left\" or \"right\". The payoffs were randomly selected, so the dataset included games like the Ultimatum, Dictator, and Trust, as well as other games. The results suggested that inequity aversion could be described as one of many strategies that people might use in such games.\n\nOther research in experimental economics addresses risk aversion in decision making and the comparison of inequality measures to subjective judgments on perceived inequalities.\n\nSurveys of employee opinions within firms have shown modern labor economists that inequity aversion is very important to them. Employees compare not only relative salaries but also relative performance against that of co-workers. Where these comparisons lead to guilt or envy, inequity aversion may lower employee morale. According to Bewley (1999), the main reason that managers create formal pay structures is so that the inter-employee comparison is seen to be \"fair\", which they considered \"key\" for morale and job performance.\n\nIt is natural to think of inequity aversion leading to greater solidarity within the labor pool, to the benefit of the average employee. However, a 2008 paper by Pedro Rey-Biel shows that this assumption can be subverted, and that an employer can use inequity aversion to get higher performance for less pay than would be possible otherwise. This is done by moving away from formal pay structures and using off-equilibrium bonus payments as incentives for extra performance. He shows that the optimal contract for inequity aversion employees is less generous at the optimal production level than contracts for \"standard agents\" (who don't have inequity aversion) in an otherwise identical two-employee model.\n\nIn 2005 Avner Shaked distributed a \"pamphlet\" entitled \"The Rhetoric of Inequity Aversion\" that attacked the inequity aversion papers of Fehr & Schmidt. In 2010, Shaked has published an extended version of the criticism together with Ken Binmore in the \"Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization\" (the same issue also contains a reply by Fehr and Schmidt and a rejoinder by Binmore and Shaked). A problem of inequity aversion models is the fact that there are free parameters; standard theory is simply a special case of the inequity aversion model. Hence, by construction inequity aversion must always be at least as good as standard theory when the inequity aversion parameters can be chosen after seeing the data. Binmore and Shaked also point out that Fehr and Schmidt (1999) pick a distribution of alpha and beta without conducting a formal estimation. The perfect correlation between the alpha and beta parameters in Fehr and Schmidt (1999) is an assumption made in the appendix of their paper that is not justified by the data that they provide. \n\nMore recently, several papers have estimated Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion parameters using estimation techniques such as maximum likelihood. The results are mixed. Some authors have found beta larger than alpha, which contradicts a central assumption made by Fehr and Schmidt (1999). Other authors have found that inequity aversion with Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) distribution of alphas and betas explains data of contract-theoretic experiments not better than standard theory; they also estimate average values of alpha that are much smaller than suggested by Fehr and Schmidt (1999). Moreover, Levitt and List (2007) have pointed out that laboratory experiments tend to exaggerate the importance of pro-social behaviors because the subjects in the laboratory know that they are being monitored. \n\nAn alternative to the concept of a general inequity aversion is the assumption that the \"degree\" and the structure of inequality could lead either to acceptance or to aversion of inequality.\n\nAn experiment on capuchin monkeys (Brosnan, S and de Waal, F) showed that the subjects would prefer receiving nothing to receiving a reward awarded inequitably in favor of a second monkey, and appeared to target their anger at the researchers responsible for the inequitable distribution of food. Anthropologists suggest that this research indicates a biological and evolutionary sense of social \"fair play\" in primates, though others believe that this is learned behavior or explained by other mechanisms. There is also evidence for inequity aversion in chimpanzees (though see a recent study questioning this interpretation). The latest study shows that chimpanzees play the Ultimatum Game in the same way as children, preferring equitable outcomes. The authors claim that we now are near the point of no difference between humans and apes with regard to a sense of fairness. Recent studies suggest that animals in the canidae family also recognize a basic level of fairness, stemming from living in cooperative societies. Animal cognition studies in other biological orders have not found similar importance on \"relative\" \"equity\" and \"justice\" as opposed to \"absolute\" utility.\n\nFehr and Schmidt's model may partially explain the widespread opposition to economic inequality in democracies, but a distinction should be drawn between inequity aversion's \"guilt\" and egalitarianism's \"compassion\", which does not necessarily imply \"injustice\".\n\nInequity aversion should not be confused with the arguments against the \"consequences\" of inequality. For example, the pro-publicly funded health care slogan \"Hospitals for the poor become poor hospitals\" directly objects to a predicted decline in medical care, not the health-care apartheid that is supposed to cause it. The argument that average medical outcomes improve with reduction in healthcare inequality (at the same total spending) is separate from the case for public healthcare on the grounds of inequity aversion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1805139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805139", "title": "WLNE-TV", "text": "WLNE-TV\n\nWLNE-TV, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 24), is an ABC-affiliated television station serving Providence, Rhode Island, United States that is licensed to New Bedford, Massachusetts. The station is owned by Standard Media. WLNE's studios are located in the Orms Building in downtown Providence, and its transmitter is based in Rehoboth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on January 1, 1963, as WTEV from studios on 430 County Street in New Bedford. Its transmitter was located in Little Compton, Rhode Island, with the antenna mounted on a tower; a few years later, WTEV moved to a tower in Tiverton. The Tiverton transmitter was still away from the transmitter sites in Rehoboth used by the existing stations in the Providence market, WJAR-TV (channel 10) and WPRO-TV (channel 12, now WPRI-TV). However, WTEV could not build a tower in Rehoboth due to the risk of interference with WRGB in Schenectady, New York, WCSH-TV in Portland, Maine, and WFIL-TV in Philadelphia, which all broadcast on channel 6 in the analog era. Before cable arrived in Rhode Island in the early 1970s, viewers experienced reception problems with WTEV. This was because for its first four decades on air, its transmitter was located in Newport County, resulting in its signal being sent from a different direction than WJAR-TV and WPRO-TV/WPRI-TV. This forced viewers to mount their outdoor antennas on rotators to get a passable signal from the station. The ensuing signal problems would be the bane of channel 6's existence for 45 years.\n\nABC had a curious history in Rhode Island prior to WTEV's sign-on. In the earliest years of television in Providence, all four networks (including DuMont) were shoehorned on primary NBC affiliate WJAR-TV, at that time the market's only television station (WJAR carried about half of NBC's and CBS' programming, but very few ABC or DuMont shows). WNET launched on channel 16 in 1953 as an ABC affiliate. However, it was forced off the air in 1956 due to the difficulties faced by UHF startups at the time. Since television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability on television sets prior to 1964, viewers needed an expensive converter (or an all-channel set, the latter being very rare at the time) to watch WNET, and the picture was marginal at best even with one. For the seven years prior to channel 6's sign-on, WJAR and CBS affiliate WPRO-TV cherry-picked ABC programming, usually airing it in off-hours but occasionally preempting their primary network's schedule. Much of Rhode Island could access the full ABC schedule from Boston stations—WHDH-TV (channel 5, now occupied by WCVB-TV) prior to January 1, 1961, and WNAC-TV (channel 7, presently occupied by the present-day WHDH [not to be confused with the now-defunct WHDH on channel 5]) from 1961 to 1963.\n\nEven though Providence was big enough to support three full network affiliates, it soon became apparent that channel 16 would not be resurrected in the near future. The owners of the future WTEV decided to seek a waiver of FCC technical regulations to allow VHF channel 6 to be added to the FCC's \"Table of Allocations\". The channel 6 license had originally been allocated to the island of Nantucket off Cape Cod, in the Boston market. However, at the time, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules required that a station have its studios and offices located in its community of license, and numerous FCC filings argued that it was not practical to operate a full-service television station from Nantucket. Since a channel 6 allocation in the Providence area would have been short-spaced to WCSH-TV and WRGB, the FCC allocation was modified to New Bedford—the nearest city on the Massachusetts side of the market where a transmitter could be built that could decently cover Providence while protecting WCSH-TV and WRGB from interference.\n\nNew Bedford and Bristol County are part of the Rhode Island market due to Rhode Island's small geographic size, even though the rest of southern Massachusetts is in the Boston market (counties were assigned by Arbitron and Nielsen to a particular television market based upon their viewing patterns). The advent of satellite television made this an irritation to some Massachusetts subscribers of services such as DirecTV and Dish Network who are unable to receive Massachusetts news and sports from Boston stations. The FCC allows network affiliates to prevent satellite subscribers from receiving network stations from outside the station's designated market. Bristol County is the only part of Massachusetts associated with Rhode Island for television purposes.\n\nWTEV was founded by WTEV Television, Inc., a group that was 55-percent owned by E. Anthony and Sons, publisher of the New Bedford \"Standard-Times\" and owner of WNBH radio (1340 AM and 98.1 FM, now WCTK); the remaining 45 percent was held by New England Television, the holder of the license for the old WNET. In 1966, shortly after E. Anthony and Sons sold the \"Standard-Times\" and WNBH, WTEV was purchased by Steinman Stations of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn June 27, 1977, WTEV swapped affiliations with WPRI and became a CBS affiliate after Knight Ridder Television, which had just purchased WPRI, cut an affiliation deal that switched two of the three television stations it owned at the time to ABC. At the time, ABC was aggressively pursuing strong NBC and CBS affiliates to switch as their ratings rose during the late 1970s, and succeeded in persuading some longtime NBC and CBS stations to switch (as an example, KSTP-TV in Minneapolis–Saint Paul and WSB-TV in Atlanta, both longtime NBC affiliates, switched to ABC during that period).\n\nIn 1979, the Steinmans sold WTEV and their flagship station, WGAL-TV in Lancaster, to Pulitzer Publishing. This sale reunited them with KOAT-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which had been sold to Pulitzer in 1969. Pulitzer changed channel 6's call letters to the present-day WLNE-TV on September 8, 1980. The new call letters were used as a promotional acronym: \"We Love New England.\" The WTEV call sign was later used on the CBS affiliate in Jacksonville, Florida, from March 1996 until September 2014, when that station changed its call sign to WJAX-TV. Under Pulitzer, the station acquired studio space in the Orms Building in downtown Providence. Within a few years, most of the station's main operations were moved to Providence. The original New Bedford facility was used as a news bureau, secondary studio, and sales office through the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Pulitzer sold WLNE to Freedom Communications. This sale was necessary because Pulitzer had acquired WFBC-TV (now WYFF) in Greenville, South Carolina, and WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, that same year, leaving the company one VHF station over the FCC's ownership limit of the time.\n\nWPRI was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995, making it a CBS owned-and-operated station and one of the last such acquisitions prior to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's purchase of the network in August of that year. This resulted in the sale of WPRI to Clear Channel Communications due to a significant signal overlap with WBZ-TV, which had joined CBS back in January of that year as a result of an affiliation agreement that also affected its sister stations, KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WJZ-TV in Baltimore. As a result, at midnight on September 10, 1995, WPRI reversed the 1977 swap with WLNE and officially rejoined CBS. WLNE then became an ABC affiliate again, and began calling itself ABC6. CBS sold WPRI to Clear Channel seven months after Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS was finalized.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of May 4, 2005, WLNE's analog transmitter was knocked off the air due to a faulty section of transmission line on the tower. The transmitter had been running at 80% power due to another unrelated technical problem that occurred approximately two weeks earlier. Although Dish Network satellite and some cable systems continued to receive broadcasts through fiber optic connections, over-the-air and DirecTV satellite subscribers were left without a local ABC affiliate (DirecTV gets its signal via antenna). Some cable providers made special temporary arrangements to carry Boston ABC station WCVB during this outage. The WLNE transmitter was operational again late Thursday evening after 32 hours off the air.\n\nIn August 2006, \"The Providence Journal\" reported that WLNE was put up for sale. The key reason for the decision was the lack of a second station for Freedom to operate in the market that would improve synergies for the Providence operation. On March 12, 2007, Freedom announced it was selling WLNE to Global Broadcasting, a Delaware corporation headed by Robinson Ewert and Kevin O'Brien. The FCC granted approval of this sale in mid-September and ownership was officially transferred on October 9. Freedom continued to operate WLNE's website until November 30, 2007, when control was shifted to Broadcast Interactive Media, and later WorldNow in April 2010. Global Broadcasting was not related to a Canadian network, the Global Television Network, or its then-parent, Canwest Global Communications.\n\nOn June 23, NewsBlues reported that Global Broadcasting co-owner Robinson Ewert had left the company amidst a dispute with CBS over licensing fees for programs originating from its syndication unit. He was replaced by Rob Holtzer, general sales manager at Sunrise Sports and Entertainment, owner of the NHL's Florida Panthers and the BankAtlantic Center in Sunrise, Florida. He is also a former national sales manager at the YES Network in New York City. Holtzer's official title at Global was vice president and director of sales.\n\nGlobal Broadcasting filed for receivership (Rhode Island's equivalent to bankruptcy) on July 29, 2010, due to declining advertising revenues. Providence attorney Matthew McGowan was appointed receiver. A month later, the station was put up for sale for the second time in four years. According to \"The Providence Journal\", several groups had expressed interest in purchasing the station and a deal was projected to be reached by the end of the year. On December 13, 2010, rumors surfaced that A.H. Belo Corp. would buy WLNE and merge its operations with those of \"The Providence Journal\"—despite the fact that the company was formed from the split of non-broadcasting operations from Belo Corporation. Belo itself was considered a likelier candidate due to the strength of its operations in other regions, and its operation of regional news channels much like WLNE's own NewsChannel 5.\n\nOn February 10, 2011, Citadel Communications of Bronxville, New York, was chosen as the stalking horse bid in the sale of the station with a bid of $4 millon. Five other groups (including one led by former Providence mayor Joseph Paolino, Jr. were also interested in purchasing the station and had until March 18 to submit competing bids prior to auction. On March 17, ABC notified potential buyers that WLNE's affiliation with the network beyond March 31, 2011, was not assured, which Global Broadcasting CEO Kevin O'Brien said could depress the final price WLNE is sold for at auction. Some observers feared that this could prompt one or more of the six companies believed to be bidding for WLNE to withdraw from bidding for the station, which may have even forced it off the air if no sale was made.\n\nOn March 22, Citadel Communications was approved as the new owner of WLNE by receiver Matthew McGowan. The company met the approval of ABC, and took over station operation on May 1 under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with McGowan and Global, under the name Global Communications LLC, until the sale was approved by the FCC, at which point Citadel would assume full ownership. On April 5, WLNE revealed programming changes made in light of the sale, which included the return of CBS Television Distribution shows \"The Insider\" and \"Inside Edition\". On April 25, veteran sales manager Chris Tzianabos was named vice president and general manager of WLNE, replacing Steve Doerr. Global CEO Kevin O'Brien tried to appeal the sale in court, arguing that attorney McGowan did not try hard enough to achieve a higher sale price for the station. However, he did not succeed in his efforts, and on June 1, it was announced that the FCC had approved the license transfer, therefore finalizing the acquisition.\n\nIn September 2011, as had been promised by Citadel upon its acquisition of the station, WLNE-TV began broadcasting newscasts and syndicated programming in full high-definition. The station additionally debuted a new circle logo and website design, matching those of other Citadel stations, but incorporating its previous stylized 6.\n\nAfter the sale of WOI-DT, WHBF-TV and KCAU-TV to the Nexstar Media Group was completed on March 13, 2014, WLNE and ABC affiliate KLKN in Lincoln, Nebraska, would become the only stations with a major network affiliation still owned by Citadel; the company also owns a news-intensive independent station, WSNN-LD/Suncoast News Network in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nOn May 16, 2019, it was announced that Standard Media, a company led by former Young Broadcasting and Media General executive Deb McDermott, would acquire WLNE and KLKN for $83 million. The sale was completed on September 5.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThe station's analog video broadcast at a frequency of 83.26MHz AM. The station's analog audio was aired at a frequency of 87.76 MHz FM. Both frequencies were +10 kHz shift from the center channel 6 frequency to prevent interference with stations in Albany, New York, Portland, Maine, and Philadelphia which were also on channel 6. WLNE's analog audio could be picked up on the lower end of the dial on most FM radios at 87.7MHz. WLNE regularly mentioned this additional way of coverage. This was true of all analog channel 6 stations in the United States. After February 17, 2009, channel 6 audio on WLNE was no longer available on the radio. (It was still available on most other full-powered channel 6 stations in the United States through June 12.)\n\nWLNE-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on February 17, 2009, the original date when full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6. It offered a nightlighting service on its analog signal for 60 days following the shutdown. The station aired a looping DTV education program as well as all of its newscasts. Due to this service being broadcast on analog channel 6, audio was still available on 87.7 FM when this period ended.\n\nOn January 16, 2012, WLNE, along with all Citadel stations, began carrying Disney-ABC's Live Well Network on its digital subchannel (6.2). The network was also seen on Cox digital channel 803, Verizon FiOS digital channel 466, Full Channel digital channel 196, and Comcast digital channel 296. Prior to this date, the station did not carry an additional network but simulcast its main programming in Standard-definition television (SDTV) on 6.2. On August 18, 2014, ahead of the discontinuation of Live Well Network in January, WLNE replaced it with two new multicast networks, Grit and Escape. On May 8, 2019, the station added the relaunched Court TV to a third subchannel. On September 30, 2019, Escape was rebranded as Court TV Mystery.\n\nWLNE's digital signal operates at 350,000 watts—equivalent to 1.75 million watts for an analog transmitter. Still, due to the fact it operates from Rehoboth with the other major Rhode Island stations, it now has a signal comparable to WJAR and WPRI for the first time ever.\n\nAs an ABC affiliate, WLNE runs virtually the entire ABC programming schedule. Effective with the 1995 affiliation switch, Saturday morning infomercials were replaced with ABC's Saturday morning program block (currently known as Litton's Weekend Adventure; that block replaced ABC Kids in 2011). Syndicated programming on WLNE includes \"Access Hollywood\", \"Inside Edition\", \"Hot Bench\", \"Judge Jerry\", \"25 Words or Less\" and \"The 700 Club\", among others.\n\nAs WTEV, the station moderately preempted ABC shows, in most every case a low-rated program. This did not pose as much of a problem, since most viewers could still get the full ABC schedule on Boston's WNAC until 1972, and on WCVB afterward. During afternoon hours, WTEV ran cartoons and classic sitcoms, with late nights being devoted to movies.\n\nBeginning in 1980, WLNE ran an afternoon movie from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. By 1982, the station was also running a movie weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. These movies were run under the \"Dialing For Dollars\" promotion and were hosted by George Allen for a decade. WLNE also continued to preempt moderate amounts of programming, particularly whatever game show CBS ran at 10:00 a.m. (to accommodate the morning movie), as well as late night programming. As a result of the preemptions, \"Child's Play\", the 1983 version of \"Press Your Luck\", and \"Blackout\" never aired on WLNE; the 1986 version of \"Card Sharks\" did not air on the station until late in the show's run. Other shows, such as \"Tattletales\" and \"Body Language\" were tape-delayed and aired in the noon slot, since WLNE did not have a noon news broadcast at that time. Providence area viewers could also watch the preempted shows via WNEV, which was available over-the-air on the Massachusetts side of the market. Throughout much of the 1980s, WLNE was known for running two movies a day.\n\nBy the fall of 1988, WLNE was only running an afternoon movie weekdays and began clearing CBS' 10:00 a.m. hour. In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' \"Guiding Light\", moving the movie to 3:00 p.m. and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00 p.m. hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS Saturday morning cartoons in favor of several movies in that time slot. In 1991, \"Guiding Light\" was reinstated. By 1993, the Saturday morning movies were replaced with educational children's programs and infomercials.\n\nFor many years, WLNE carried the syndicated shows \"Dr. Phil\", \"Rachael Ray\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"The Insider\", and \"Inside Edition\" from CBS Television Distribution. However, in mid-2009, the station was unable to reach a carriage agreement with the syndicator, successor to King World Productions and Paramount Domestic Television. At that time, the station was carrying \"Dr. Phil\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", and \"Inside Edition\". As a result of the situation, the shows were dropped on June 5 and quickly moved to WNAC-TV (channel 64, and the legal successor to the former WNET). Temporarily put in their place were \"Cristina's Court\", \"Family Court with Judge Penny\", a 7:00 p.m. newscast, and \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\". On June 16, CBS filed a lawsuit against Global Broadcasting for failing to fully pay license fees for the shows and a breach of contract. The syndicator sought $5 million from the company.\n\nThe longest-running program on channel 6 is \"TV Mass\" from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, which began in 1963. Produced by WLNE, the show was originally aired at 8:00 a.m. It is normally taped at the chapel of Bishop Stang High School in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Easter Mass and Christmas Mass are normally taped at St. Mary's Cathedral in Fall River, Massachusetts. As of 2011, the masses are independently produced and continue to air on WLNE, with the weekly mass at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings and the Easter and Christmas Mass at 11:30 a.m. and Noon respectively.\n\nPrior to its host's retirement, the longest running program on WLNE was \"The Truman Taylor Show\". The Sunday morning public affairs program debuted very early in 1963. Numerous politicians appeared on the show, including two U.S. presidents. In late 2005, Truman Taylor taped his final show. He is now a featured op-ed columnist for the \"Providence Journal\". In early 2006, \"ABC6 News On the Record\" replaced \"Truman Taylor\", with Jim Hummel hosting the program until his departure from the station in July 2008. Following his departure, \"On the Record\" was temporarily taken off-the-air and replaced with infomercials. The show returned in October 2008 with John DeLuca and former Providence mayor Buddy Cianci as co-hosts. Cianci would host the show solo from May 2011 until his death in January 2016. Another hiatus would follow.\n\nOn June 19, 2016, WLNE debuted \"In the Arena\", with former Providence mayor Joe Paolino, Jr. as host. The show initially consisted of a round table discussion with guest political analysts and Paolino as moderator. It has since evolved into a more traditional one-on-one interview with Paolino and a single guest. The show's title is a reference to a passage in President Theodore Roosevelt's Citizenship in a Republic speech about \"The Man in the Arena.\" \"In the Arena\" airs Sundays at 7:00 a.m.\n\nWLNE had been the market home of \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\" since 1993. As WTEV, it was one of the first affiliates of the \"Love Network\" when it was formed in 1968. Local segments had been broadcast from the Warwick Mall for several years. In 2007, the telethon relocated to the Marriott hotel in downtown Providence. In 2008, the telethon was broadcast from Twin River Casino in Lincoln. Local segments continued to be broadcast from Twin River until 2012, when the telethon became the \"MDA Show of Strength\". The following year, the show began being televised over one national network (ABC) and the local segments were discontinued. The final \"Show of Strength\" was broadcast in 2014.\n\nWLNE became the first station in Rhode Island to broadcast a local program in high-definition when it aired Bristol's 4th of July Parade in 2008 live with production facilities provided by Comcast. In 2009, the station won an Emmy Award for its pre-parade special, \"Reflections of the Fourth: Celebrating Bristol\", from the Boston/New England chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The parade was not broadcast in 2011 amidst the change in station ownership, but would return in 2012. WLNE has been the official television home of the parade since 2006.\n\n\"Caught in Providence\" is a reality court show presided over by Judge Frank Caprio. The program showcases the proceedings inside Providence Municipal Court. Produced and directed by Judge Caprio's brother Joseph and his company Citylife Productions, the program originated on PEG access television in Rhode Island and was first picked up by WLNE in 2000, initially airing in late night on Saturdays. Following a hiatus, \"Caught in Providence\" returned in 2015 and aired following the 11 o'clock newscasts on Saturdays until September 2017. It was during this run that the program went viral. Several clips began appearing on social media, garnering millions of views. The program has also received coverage from media organizations around the world, such as NBC News and the \"Daily Mail\".\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that Debmar-Mercury had picked up \"Caught in Providence\" for daily national syndication, this as clips from the program eclipsed one billion views. The program was initially sold to the Fox Television Stations group and debuted nationally on September 24, 2018. Locally, the program airs in Providence on The CW affiliate WNAC-DT2 and in Boston on CW affiliate WLVI.\n\nNewsChannel 5, formerly known as the Rhode Island News Channel (RINC), began broadcasting on November 30, 1998. Operated by WLNE (until 2012) and Cox Communications, it was the first and only 24-hour local news channel in the state. It provided non-stop news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mainly consisting of rebroadcasts of news that aired on WLNE. The station could only be found on Cox Cable channel 5 in Rhode Island. NewsChannel 5 also provided live, continuing coverage of breaking news and other events. When severe weather struck, the WLNE weather team provided up to the minute forecasts.\n\nPrior to Citadel Communications' acquisition of WLNE, there were three live newscasts that aired exclusively on NewsChannel 5. From its launch, a weekend morning newscast was seen exclusively on the station. As of May 2011, this newscast was also broadcast on the main channel. On September 29, 2008, WLNE began offering an extra hour of local news on weekday mornings at 7:00 a.m. An extended hour of \"Good Morning Providence\" was one of two 7 o'clock local newscasts in the market, the other being an extended hour of WPRI's \"Eyewitness News This Morning\" on WNAC-TV. This newscast was no longer broadcast as of May 2011. WLNE occasionally aired a 10 o'clock newscast during major news events or when sports programming preempted the 10 o'clock news on competitor WNAC. As of May 2011, this newscast no longer aired.\n\nFor a brief period in September 2009, an audio feed of NewsChannel 5 was broadcast on radio station WALE in various timeslots; this included a start-to-finish simulcast of the \"Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon\". On February 1, 2012, WLNE's affiliation with Cox channel 5 ended, and its programming on the channel was replaced with WJAR programming and is now Ocean State Networks (OSN).\n\nWLNE presently broadcasts 27 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLNE has placed a distant third in the market, behind WJAR and WPRI. The station has been known for numerous turnovers in format, talent and management over the years for the purpose of increasing its newscast ratings and sales revenue, all having little or no effect. Under Global Broadcasting's ownership, changes in image and news coverage resulted in a marginal ratings increase and for a time, \"ABC6 News\" was promoted as \"New England's Fastest Growing News\". The ratings surge did not last for long. However, on March 29, 2011, WLNE scored its first late news victory in years, finishing number one at 11:00 p.m. following the series premiere of network medical drama \"Body of Proof\", which was filmed entirely in Rhode Island for its first season.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, WLNE announced that infamous former Providence mayor and WPRO personality Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci would join the station as chief political analyst and contributing editor starting on November 1. Cianci was a political analyst at WLNE in the late 1980s. As part of his duties at the station, he moderated a daily segment on \"ABC6 News\". It was first entitled \"Your Attention Please\" and was co-moderated in-studio by former Chief Reporter Jim Hummel. Following Hummel's departure from the station in July 2008, it was changed to \"Buddy TV\" and weeknight anchor John DeLuca became co-moderator. The segment aired live during the former \"ABC6 News First At Four\" with Cianci first appearing in-studio and then from the East Providence studios of WPRO, where the segment was simulcast during his weekday show that aired from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. In October 2008, he started co-hosting the Sunday morning public affairs program \"ABC6 News On the Record\" with DeLuca.\n\nWith the change in station ownership in May 2011, the segment name was changed to \"The World According to Buddy\" with a solo Cianci in the ABC6 studios. The segment was taped live during the noon newscasts and re-aired during the 5 o'clock news. He also became a solo host of \"On the Record\". On June 25, 2014, Cianci announced that he would be seeking a third term as mayor of Providence as an Independent candidate. As a result, he had to step down from his position at WLNE as well as WPRO for the duration of the campaign. Former chief political reporter Mark Curtis took over as host of the program while Cianci campaigned for office. He lost the bid to Democrat Jorge Elorza and returned to his previous positions shortly after the 2014 general elections.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Cianci was taken from the WLNE studios to Miriam Hospital after falling ill during the taping of \"On the Record\" and was pronounced dead on January 28 at age 74. The episode did not make air, with a special on Cianci airing in its place on January 31. The Sunday morning public affairs program was then put on hiatus until June 2016 when \"In the Arena\" with Joe Paolino debuted.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, WLNE announced it would launch \"ABC6 News First at Four\", the market's first-ever 4 o'clock news on January 14, 2008. Described as a \"hard newscast\" and not morning-show style fluff, \"First at Four\" gave WLNE a head start in coverage of weather and politics. The hour-long newscast aired for just over three years and competed head to head with \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" airing on WJAR. \"First at Four\" last aired in April 2011 prior to the sale of the station to Citadel. In March 2020, under Standard Media, WLNE began airing a special half-hour 4 o'clock newscast with extended coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This newscast became a regular part of the schedule on April 13, 2020 and the \"First at Four\" title was revived.\n\nIn May 2009, WLNE launched a 10 o'clock newscast on Sunday mornings. Previously, it had only produced weekend morning newscasts for \"NewsChannel 5\". It was the only Providence station with a local news broadcast airing at that time. In May 2011, Citadel moved the newscast to 7:30 a.m. and added Saturday morning broadcasts in addition to Sunday mornings. The weekend morning newscasts were cancelled in 2012.\n\nIn June 2009, the station launched the market's first (since the 1980s) 7 o'clock newscast on weeknights, filling the spot vacated by \"Entertainment Tonight\", which was taken off the schedule due to the station's dispute with CBS Television Distribution. In March 2011, this newscast was replaced with infomercials, with the newscast airing only in the event they could not sell the time slot on a given day. After the station's sale to Citadel, this newscast was officially replaced with syndicated programming the following month.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, WLNE announced a new programming lineup that included the addition of a 5:00 p.m. newscast on April 25. The station then began to shift towards video journalism, and all remaining reporters and future hires were required to be one-person bands. On September 13, WLNE became the second station in the market to broadcast news in high-definition, behind WJAR and just a week ahead of WPRI/WNAC. Along with the transition came a standardized graphics package used by other Citadel stations. The station received the company's standardized news set in August 2012. \n\nIn weather segments, WLNE uses live regional radar from the National Weather Service local office in Taunton, Massachusetts, along with high-resolution satellite. The segments are presented on-air under the Stormtracker label. From 2012 to 2017, the Stormtracker Weather Team was certified as providing Southern New England's most accurate forecast by WeatheRate, an independent weather research firm. On July 19, 2012, WLNE became the first station in Southern New England to be recognized as StormReady by the National Weather Service.\n\nWLNE won the Massachusetts/Rhode Island Associated Press News Station of the Year award four years in a row from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2002. The station also won a regional Edward R. Murrow Award for Investigative Reporting two consecutive years.\n\nDue to its coverage area overlapping with Boston's ABC affiliate WCVB, the two stations share resources for coverage of southeastern Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805149", "title": "Timelash", "text": "Timelash\n\nTimelash is the fifth serial of the 22nd season in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on BBC1 on 9 and 16 March 1985.\n\nIn the serial, the Borad (Robert Ashby), the mutated leader of the planet Karfel, plots to start a war with the Bandril race which would wipe out both the Bandrils and Karfel's Karfelon population so that the Borad could repopulate it with his own kind to rule the planet.\n\nThe TARDIS is suddenly ensnared by a Kontron corridor (similar to a time corridor). After the Sixth Doctor tries unsuccessfully to free the ship, he and Peri strap themselves in, bracing themselves for the potentially disastrous occurrences. The TARDIS approaches the corridor, and is nearly torn apart by the impact but stabilises once it has entered the corridor, and is navigated to the source of the disturbance, the planet Karfel, a world which the Doctor has visited before.\n\nOn Karfel, the small population is ruled in a rigid hierarchy, at the apex of which is the Borad, a sadistic and despotic ruler. The Borad has never shown himself in person, only via security monitors which reveal him to be a dignified old man, but something in his manner does not ring true. Fear is enforced rigidly through the policing of androids; and all rebels are dealt with either by summary execution or despatch and death via the Timelash - a permanent, and ultimately fatal, exile down a corridor of Time and Space. Acting as a proxy for the Borad, the Maylin is the most senior of the five Counsellors of Karfel. One of them, Mykros, has grown unhappy with the rule of the Borad. Since the Borad came to power their people have become disillusioned, rebellious and miserable, and their former allies, the Bandrils, are posed to invade. The Bandrils threaten war after the Borad rescinds the grain supply treaty which underpinned the relationship between the two civilisations.\n\nMykros determines to discover the truth and follows the Maylin, Renis, into the Borad's power chamber. The unhappy Renis is transferring the power supplies of the Karfelons into the Borad's personal system, despite the danger to his own wife, who is recovering from hospital surgery. Renis finds Mykros and gives him his blessing in rebellion. However, the Borad finds out and metes out the usual punishment: Renis is aged to death in a deadly beam while Mykros is sentenced to the Timelash. Before he can be sent in, however, Vena, Renis' daughter and Mykros' lover intervenes to plead for his life. When this fails, she steals an amulet conferring the power to pervert the energy supply from the new Maylin, the sycophantic Tekker, and accidentally falls into the web of the Timelash herself.\n\nThe arrival of the TARDIS presents Tekker with an opportunity to try and retrieve the amulet. The clever Maylin greets the Doctor and Peri as favoured guests, but the Doctor is suspicious of a Karfelon society that has made huge scientific leaps in a short space of time and that does not permit mirrors. When the Doctor refuses to venture into the Timelash, Tekker explains that Peri has been taken hostage to ensure his co-operation in retrieving the amulet. She has been taken to the caves of the Morlox, large lizards indigenous to Karfel, where her captors hope she will die. She is rescued by some Karfelon rebels, Katz and Sezon, who kill one of the creatures threatening her and take her into their company. However, they are soon attacked and captured by a patrol of guards.\n\nTo protect Peri the Doctor returns the TARDIS into the Timelash and travels to Scotland in 1885. When the Doctor arrives he finds Vena, the amulet and a young man named Herbert. All three depart on their return journey to return the amulet – which is all Tekker cares about when the TARDIS arrives back in the Council Chamber. The Doctor, Vena and Herbert are rounded up with the rebels. Sezon and Katz are condemned to the Timelash.\n\nThey fight back, killing Councillor Brunner, and seal the doors of the Chamber, determined to hold out in a siege. This buys the Doctor enough time to hoist into the Timelash on a rope and take two Kontron Crystals from the wall of the Time Corridor. He uses this to create a time ruse allowing him to slip out of the Chamber, and Herbert follows.\n\nTekker has meanwhile fled to the Borad, and blames the setback on the last remaining loyal Counsellor, Kendron, whom the Borad executes. Tekker remains with the Borad, now revealed to be a hideous amalgam of human and Morlox. They watch on a screen as Peri is brought into a cave and strapped down while Morlox gather to feed. A canister of the chemical Mustakozene-80 is placed nearby, which has the ability to fuse together different tissue as one creature. It seems the Borad has taken a liking to Peri and wishes to mutate her like himself. The Doctor arrives to confront Tekker and the Borad, recognising the latter as Megelen, a crazed scientist he encountered on his previous visit to Karfel and exposed to the Counsel for unethical experiments on Morloxes. It seems one of those experiments has now gone wrong, and Megelen wishes to replicate its effect to create a partner. His plan has been to provoke a war with the Bandrils that will result in their use of warheads which will wipe out all the Karfelons – but leave the Morlox and himself alive – allowing him to repopulate the world in his own image. This revelation prompts Tekker too to rebel, but he is swiftly aged to death. The Doctor then uses a Kontron Crystal to deflect Megelen's beam back at him, killing the mutant in his wheelchair.\n\nHerbert now helps the Doctor rescue Peri. They return to the Council Chamber where Mykros and Vena have identified a Bandril invasion fleet which is close to Karfel. The Bandrils are suspicious of the Doctor's attempts to intervene and prevent a missile strike, causing him to take drastic action. The Doctor materialises the TARDIS in the path of the incoming warhead, risking his own life to save Karfel. He does so successfully and returns to Karfel to find Megelen returned from the dead and threatening the Council Chamber – or rather the other one was a clone of this original. Megelen is made unbalanced by the image of himself in a boarded up mirror, revealing the reason he hid himself away, and in this state is thrown into the Timelash by the Doctor, where he may have ended up as the Loch Ness monster (The Doctor says \"he may be seen from time to time\").\n\nAs the Doctor and Peri are about to depart and take Herbert back to his right time, Herbert, says he wishes to stay on Karfel. The Doctor, however confides in Peri that he has a feeling that Herbert will return to 1885. He shows her Herbert's calling card which gives his name as Herbert George Wells.\n\nA mural of the Third Doctor's face is revealed behind a section of wall panelling in the Timelash control room, while Peri recognises a photograph of Jo Grant.\n\nIn the 2010 \"Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"Death of the Doctor\", his erstwhile companion Jo recounted her visit to the planet, explaining, \"The Doctor took me to this planet once called Karfel. And they had a leisure garden. And the plants could sing.\"\n\nThis serial makes several references to Wells' novels: \"The Time Machine\", \"The War of the Worlds\", \"The Invisible Man\", and \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\".\n\nThe music for this story was provided by Elizabeth Parker, who had formerly contributed special sound for \"Blake's 7\".\n\nPaul Darrow had previously appeared in \"Doctor Who and the Silurians\" as Captain Hawkins. Denis Carey previously played Professor Chronotis in the incomplete serial \"Shada\" and the Keeper in \"The Keeper of Traken\".\n\nDarrow has acknowledged that producer John Nathan-Turner was initially unhappy with his performance, which he based on \"Richard III\", and he was accused of \"sending it up\". However, he claims Nathan-Turner later praised him, saying: \"You were absolutely right to do it that way - the script wasn't that good and you made something of it.\"\n\n\"Timelash\" was panned by \"Doctor Who\" critics. Guest star Paul Darrow described \"Timelash\" as \"the most disliked and also one of the most liked, which is fascinating\". Graham Sleight noted that \"Timelash\" is \"widely regarded as one of the worst series ever broadcast as part of \"Doctor Who\"\", claiming the story has \"a weak script, cheap-looking design, unimaginative direction, laughable special effects and some appalling performances\". However, Sleight also praises Robert Ashby's performance as the Borad, claiming Ashby's performance \"elevates his menace to an entirely different level to the rest of the story\". Tat Wood described it as \"a grindingly dull story only memorable for being made as a school panto with belated New Romantic 80s fashion errors\". Wood singled out the story's script, production and costumes for particular criticism. Wood also pointed out the H.G. Wells depicted in \"Timelash\" is different from the real-life Wells (the Wells depicted in \"Timelash\" is not blond, lacks a Cockney/Kentish accent, and is interested in spiritualism).\n\nIn \"The Discontinuity Guide\", \"Timelash\" was criticised for \"tacky sets and some dodgy acting\" but was also said to be \"nowhere near as bad as its reputation\". \"Doctor Who: The Television Companion\" noted that the serial was not popular with fans of the show, but was at least \"a reassuringly traditional \"Doctor Who\" adventure\" in a season which contained \"derivative, incomprehensible and inappropriately violent stories\". In \"Doctor Who: The Complete Guide\", Mark Campbell awarded \"Timelash\" seven out of ten, describing it as \"an unfairly maligned homage to HG Wells and bad 'B' movies, \"Timelash\" is good, old-fashioned entertainment in a season brimming with macho portentousness. It all goes pear-shaped towards the end, but on the way there's plenty of fun to be had.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s Tim Stanley wrote of the serial: \"The sets are bad, the acting is bad, the script stinks, the effects are laughable and – most importantly – Colin's Doctor is simply unlovable.\" Den of Geek's Andrew Blair selected \"Timelash\" as one of the ten \"Doctor Who\" stories that would make great musicals. Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" awarded the serial one star from five, describing it as \"a turkey that's also a hoot\". In his view, the serial was \"codswallop served cold: boring Tardis scenes are intercut with stultifying political machinations on Karfel, a drab planet ruled by a lethargic lizard-man and about to be obliterated by glove-puppet Bandrils\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Glen McCoy, was published by Target Books in December 1985.\n\nA book length study of the serial, written by Phil Pascoe, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2019.\n\n\"Timelash\" was released on VHS on 5 January 1998, It was released on DVD on 9 July 2007 with a commentary provided by actors Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Paul Darrow, and Robert Ashby along with a selection of other features.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805166", "title": "Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden", "text": "Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden\n\nThe dissolution of the union (; ; Landsmål: \"Unionsoppløysingi\"; ) between the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden under the House of Bernadotte, was set in motion by a resolution of the Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) on 7 June 1905. Following some months of tension and fear of war between the neighboring kingdoms (then in personal union) – and a Norwegian plebiscite held on 13 August which overwhelmingly backed dissolution – negotiations between the two governments led to Sweden's recognition of Norway as an independent constitutional monarchy on 26 October 1905. On that date, King Oscar II renounced his claim to the Norwegian throne, effectively dissolving the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, and this event was swiftly followed, on 18 November, by the accession to the Norwegian throne of Prince Carl of Denmark, taking the name of Haakon VII.\n\nNorwegian nationalistic aspirations in 1814 were frustrated by Sweden's victory in a brief, but decisive war that resulted in Norway entering into a personal union with Sweden. The Norwegian constitution was largely kept intact. Norway legally had the status of an independent state, with its own parliament, judiciary, legal system, armed forces, flag, and currency. However, Norway and Sweden shared a common monarch and conducted a common foreign policy through the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs. There largely existed feelings of goodwill between the two peoples, and the King generally tried to act in the interest of both Kingdoms.\n\nHowever, over the years, a divergence of Norwegian and Swedish interests became apparent. In particular, Norwegians felt that their foreign policy interests were inadequately served by Sweden's ministry of foreign affairs. There were several driving factors behind the growing conflict:\n\n\nIn addition, Norwegian politics were increasingly dominated by liberal tendencies characterized by the extension of parliamentary democracy, while Swedish politics tended to be more conservative. Under the Norwegian Constitution, the Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, was the most powerful legislature on the Continent. The king only had a suspensive veto in Norway, and the Storting resisted numerous royal attempts to be granted the absolute veto that the monarchy had in Sweden. Additionally, by 1884, the Storting's power had grown to the point that a king could no longer appoint a Norwegian government entirely of his own choosing or keep it in office against the will of the Storting. In contrast, the king remained a near-autocrat (at least on paper) in his Swedish domains until 1905, just before the end of the union.\n\nWhen free trade between the two countries was restricted in 1895 by the abolition of the \"Interstate laws\" (\"Mellomrikslovene\"), the economic reasons for the continued union were also diminished.\n\nThe conflict came to a head over the so-called \"consul affair\" in which successive Norwegian governments insisted that Norway should establish its own consular offices abroad rather than rely on the common consulates appointed by the Swedish foreign minister. As the longstanding practice for the conduct of joint foreign policy had been that a Swede would always hold the office of foreign minister, the Swedish government and king opposed this insistence, seeing it as a rejection of the throne's right to set foreign policy.\n\nWhile Norway's Liberal Party had initially pioneered an uncompromising position through the so-called \"fist policy,\" the Conservative Party also came to adopt a strong policy in favor of at least \"de facto\" independence and equality within the personal union. Although both parties made efforts to resolve the issue through negotiations, Norwegian public opinion gradually became more entrenched.\n\nBoth Sweden and Norway increased their military expenditure; Norway not only modernized the frontier forts at Kongsvinger and Fredriksten, but also built a series of new military strongholds along its border with Sweden.\n\nIn early 1905, Christian Michelsen formed a coalition government consisting of liberals and conservatives, whose only stated objective was to establish a separate Norwegian corps of consuls. The law was passed by the Norwegian parliament. As expected and probably as planned, King Oscar II vetoed the laws, and the Michelsen government tendered its resignation. \n\nHowever, Oscar refused to accept the resignations. In turn, Michelsen and his ministers refused to countersign Oscar's decision and returned to Christiania on 7 June 1905, triggering a constitutional crisis. Later that day, the Storting voted unanimously to dissolve the union with Sweden, taking the line that Oscar had effectively abandoned his role as King of Norway by refusing to appoint a replacement government. It also empowered the Michelsen cabinet to act as a caretaker government until further notice, vesting it with the executive authority normally vested in the crown.\n\nThe text of the unanimous declaration, remarkable for the fact that the declaration of the dissolution was an aside to the main clause, read:\n\nInitially reacting to this declaration as a rebellious act, the Swedish government indicated an openness to a negotiated end to the union, insisting among other things on a Norwegian plebiscite. However, the Norwegian government had anticipated this, and had already scheduled a plebiscite for 13 August—thus avoiding the appearance that it had been called in response to demands from Sweden.\n\nBesides internal changes within Norway, a major key factor that allowed Norway to break from Sweden was the emerging Swedish social democratic movement. In the early years of the 20th century, Hjalmar Branting led the Social Democrats in opposing a war to keep Norway united with Sweden. When the crisis of 1905 occurred, he coined the slogan \"Hands off Norway, King!\" The Social Democrats organized both resistance to a call-up of reserves and a general strike against a war. The majority of the Swedish people were as supportive of a fully separate Norway as their Norwegian counterparts.\n\nIn one of the most lopsided referendum results in history, the plebiscite was held on 13 August and resulted in an overwhelming 368,208 votes (99.95%) in favor of confirming the dissolution of the union against only 184 (0.05%) opposed.\n\nThe government thereby had confirmation of the dissolution. 85 percent of Norwegian men had cast their votes, but no women as universal suffrage was not extended to women until 1913. Norwegian feminists however collected 279,878 signatures in favor of dissolution.\n\nPolar explorer Fridtjof Nansen weighed in heavily for dissolving the union, and personally traveled to the United Kingdom, where he successfully lobbied for British support for Norway's independence movement.\n\nOn 31 August, Norwegian and Swedish delegates met in the Swedish city of Karlstad to negotiate the terms of the dissolution. Although many prominent right-wing Swedish politicians favored a hardline approach to the issue, historical scholars have found that the Swedish King had determined early on that it would be better to lose the union than risk a war with Norway. The overwhelming public support among Norwegians for independence had convinced the major European powers that the independence movement was legitimate, and Sweden feared it would be isolated by suppressing it; furthermore, there was little appetite for creating additional ill will between the countries.\n\nEven as the negotiations made progress, military forces, though separated by 2 kilometers (1.24 miles), were quietly deployed on both sides of the border between Sweden and Norway. Public opinion among Norwegian leftists favored a war of independence if necessary, regardless of Sweden's numerical superiority.\n\nOn 23 September, the negotiations concluded. On 9 October the Norwegian parliament voted to accept the terms of the dissolution; on 13 October the Swedish parliament followed suit. Although Norway had considered the union with Sweden ended as of 7 June, Sweden formally recognized Norwegian independence on 26 October when King Oscar II renounced his and any of his descendants' claims to the Norwegian throne.\n\nIn its resolution of 7 June, the Storting had made what is called the \"Bernadotte Offer,\" invited King Oscar II to allow one of his younger sons to assume the Norwegian throne. The offer was at one level an attempt by the Norwegian government to demonstrate goodwill towards Sweden and its royal house, notwithstanding the separation of the two countries. At another, more significant level, it was also intended to reassure the other European powers that the secession of Norway was not a radical revolutionary project, despite the influence of socialists. The continuation of the monarchical system would signal that tradition, continuity and order would be cherished as before in the new country. In this way, Norway aimed to gather support from the other large European countries which, with the exception of France, were all hereditary monarchies.\n\nUnlike the declaration of independence, the Bernadotte Offer was a matter of contention and controversy within the Norwegian government. Five socialists in the parliament voted against the idea of having a monarchy, and the finance minister Gunnar Knudsen, a republican member of the cabinet, resigned over this issue. It was known that King Oscar II was not amenable to accepting the Bernadotte offer, but the issue remained unsettled until the offer was formally declined by the king when he renounced his claim on 26 October.\n\nThe King's rejection of the Bernadotte offer had been anticipated months earlier, and already during the summer a Norwegian delegation had approached Denmark with a proposal regarding the 33-year-old Prince Carl of Denmark, the second son of Crown Prince Frederick. Prince Carl was related on his father's side to medieval Norwegian kings, providing a link to Norway's past history. Prince Carl's mother, Louise of Sweden, was the niece of Oscar II and the only child of Oscar's elder brother and predecessor, Charles XV of Sweden, and therefore a link to the royal house of Sweden would be preserved. Also, Carl was married to Maud, daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. By bringing in a British-born queen, it was hoped that Norway could court Britain's support. Another advantage was that Prince Carl was already the father of a son, the two-year-old Alexander, ensuring that a successor would be in position to continue the line. The Norwegian parliament considered other candidates but ultimately chose Prince Carl.\n\nPrince Carl impressed the delegation in many ways, not the least because of his sensitivity to the liberal and democratic movements that had led to Norway's independence. Though the Norwegian constitution stipulated that the Storting could choose a new king if the throne were vacant, Carl was aware that many Norwegians — including leading politicians and high-ranking military officers — favored a republican form of government. Attempts to persuade the prince to accept the throne on the basis of the Parliament's and not the common citizenry's choice failed; Carl insisted that he would accept the crown only if the Norwegian people expressed their will for monarchy by referendum and also if the parliament then elected him king.\nOn 12 and 13 November, in the second constitutional plebiscite in three months, Norwegian voters decided by a nearly 79 percent majority (259,563 to 69,264) to establish a monarchy instead of a republic. Many who favored a republic in principle voted for a monarchy because they felt it would help the newly independent Norwegian nation gain legitimacy among the European monarchies.\n\nFive days later, on November 18, the Storting overwhelmingly elected Carl and his descendants as the new royal dynasty of Norway. On that same date, the Speaker of the Storting sent Prince Carl a telegram informing him of his election. After obtaining formal permission from his grandfather Christian IX of Denmark, Prince Carl replied that same evening, accepting the Norwegian throne and choosing the name Haakon, a traditional name used by Norwegian kings. The last king with that name was Haakon VI, who died in the year 1380. The new king therefore took the regnal name Haakon VII, while his son Alexander was renamed Olav and became crown prince. Haakon VII became King of Norway immediately upon accepting his election, and therefore 18 November 1905 is counted as the first day of his reign.\n\nAfter a three-day journey, the new royal family arrived in the capital Kristiania (later renamed Oslo) on 25 November. Haakon VII took his constitutional oath before parliament on 27 November. However, Norway counts 18 November, the day of his election, as the formal beginning of his reign. He and Queen Maud were crowned in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 22 June 1906. This was the last coronation held in Norway.\n\nThe following individuals played a role in the events surrounding the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden:\n\nIn many ways, the events of 1905 formed a sequel to the events of 1814, but there were some important differences:\n\nMuch has been made of the supremacy of diplomacy in averting war between Sweden and Norway in 1905. In truth, the Norwegians were much more willing to fight than the Swedes if it had come to war. Both parties recognized that their geographical proximity made long-term hostility untenable under any circumstances.\n\nMany documents related to the specific events of 1905 were destroyed during and following those years. Some historians speculate that foreign interests played a stronger role than had previously been assumed; in particular, that Great Britain influenced the dissolution in order to reduce German influence over Atlantic ports as part of British attempts to maintain its naval supremacy. Although Sweden's close relationship with Germany did not last long, Norway's independence immediately put it inside the British sphere of influence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805171", "title": "Lystra", "text": "Lystra\n\nLystra () was a city in central Anatolia, now part of present-day Turkey. It is mentioned six times in the New Testament. Lystra was visited several times by the Paul the Apostle, along with Barnabas or Silas. There Paul met a young disciple, Timothy. Lystra was included by various authors in ancient Lycaonia, Isauria, or Galatia.\n\nThe site of Lystra is believed to be located south of the city of Konya (Iconium in the New Testament), north of the village of Hatunsaray and some north of a small town called Akoren. A small museum within the village of Hatunsaray displays artifacts from ancient Lystra.\n\nLystra is the ancient name of the village visited by Paul the Apostle. There is a present-day village called \"Klistra\" near Gökyurt, a village of the Meram district of Konya province. Ancient ruins can be seen near Klistra, including a church with a big cross marked on the wall, a winery, house-like buildings, and the ruins of a city located over the top of a hill which is locally called \"Alusumas\", where another church ruin can be seen. According to local people, the less-visible city was constructed over the hill to hide from enemies of ancient Anatolia. This site is still awaiting excavation.\n\nLystra is located on an ancient road which ran from Ephesus to Sardis to Antioch in Pisidia to Iconium and Lystra, to Derbe, through the Cilician Gates, to Tarsus, to Antioch in Syria, and then to points east and south.\n\nThe Roman Empire made Lystra a colony in 6 BCE, under the name of Colonia Iulia Felix Gemina, possibly to gain better control of the tribes in the mountains to the west. Later, it was incorporated into the Roman province of Galatia, and soon afterwards the Romans built a road connecting Lystra to Iconium to the north.\n\nPaul the Apostle visited here to preach the Christian gospel in 48 AD and again in 51 AD on his first and second missionary journeys, initially coming after persecution drove him away from Iconium.\n\nAccording to , Paul healed a man who had been lame from birth. The man leaped up and began to walk and thus so impressed the crowd that they took Paul for Hermes, because he was the \"chief speaker,\" and his companion Barnabas for Zeus. The crowd spoke in the local Lycaonian language and wanted to offer sacrifices to them, but Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes in dismay and shouted that they were merely men. They used this opportunity to tell the Lystrans of the Creator God citing 'the rain from heaven and fruitful seasons' as evidence of God's activity and generosity.\n\nSoon, however, through the influence of the Jewish leaders from Antioch, Pisidia and Iconium, the Lystrans stoned Paul and left him for dead. As the disciples gathered around him, Paul stood on his feet and went back into the town. The next day, he and Barnabas left for Derbe; but on the return part of their journey, they stopped once more at Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to steadfastness.\n\nPaul visited this city again on his second missionary tour. Timothy, a young disciple there, was probably among those who on the previous occasion at Lystra witnessed Paul's persecution and courage. Timothy left Lystra to become the companion of Paul and Silas on the rest of the Second Missionary Journey. It is also possible that Paul revisited Lystra near the beginning of his Third Missionary Journey.\n\nUnlike other cities Paul visited, Lystra apparently had no synagogue, although Timothy and his mother and grandmother were Jewish. Lystra appears to have been the first location where the apostles reached the Gentiles with the gospel of Christ without approaching them through the common ground of Judaism. Theologian John Gill linked Paul's reference to 'the rain from heaven and fruitful seasons' to the words of the Jewish prophet Jeremiah: \"Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?\"\n\nIn Christian times Lystra had a bishop. It is included in the Roman Catholic Church's list of titular sees, the most recent titular bishop having been Bishop Enrique A. Angelelli Carletti in the 1960s, later Bishop of La Rioja, Argentina.\n\nArchaeologist and New Testament Scholar Sir William Mitchell Ramsay wrote in 1907: \"Excavation at Lystra is urgently needed in the interests of history and New Testament study\". He wrote in 1941: \"One hopes that some enthusiast will spend the money needed to clear up the topography of Lystra; and some fragments, at present valueless, may be completed by his discoveries\".\n\n"}

When Marge becomes stressed, the Simpsons hire a nanny, a Mary Poppins parody named Shary Bobbins (voiced by Maggie Roswell). The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz and written and executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. It was the last episode for which Reiss received a writing credit. In 2014, Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.\n\nAfter discovering that she is losing her hair at an alarming rate, Marge visits Dr. Hibbert, who informs her that stress is the cause. The Simpsons decide to hire a nanny to perform housework and childcare, but have trouble finding the right one. Bart and Lisa sing a song about the ideal nanny. When a woman glides from the sky with a magical umbrella and introduces herself as Shary Bobbins, she seems perfect and is hired.\n\nShary proves helpful for the Simpson family. Marge's stress subsides and her hair grows back. As the reformed family sits down to a perfect dinner, Shary declares her work done. After leaving the house, she sees Homer strangling Bart, Maggie trying to douse a fire and Marge losing her hair again. With the family reverting to its previous state of dysfunction, Shary is forced to stay.\n\nSoon the family treats her rudely and loses interest in her zest for life and zealous reform. Declaring that the Simpsons will be the death of her, she becomes depressed and starts to cry, sing and drink. After realizing what effect the Simpsons have had on their nanny, Marge admits to Shary that nothing can change them. The Simpsons declare they are happy the way they are through a song. Shary accepts this and leaves using her magical umbrella. Although Homer suggests they might see her again someday, she is sucked into a jet engine, unbeknownst to the family.\n\nAlthough the majority of the season eight episodes were executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss had signed a deal with Disney that allowed them to produce four episodes of \"The Simpsons\". The idea for this episode originated several years before its airdate when Jean and Reiss were the regular showrunners. The idea was pitched at a writers' retreat by Jean but nobody had wanted to flesh it out. After being allowed to come back to produce some episodes, Jean and Reiss decided to write this episode. At first, Reiss was against the episode and felt that it was a bad idea. He felt that the plot was slightly ridiculous and that the show should not feature any magic; except for a few moments, he largely kept magic out of the episode. He now considers it one of the best episodes that he co-wrote. At the time, \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\" had more music in it than any other episode. While writing, Jean thought that the songs would stretch out and make the episode the proper length but it was considerably shorter than required. Several additional scenes, such as the \"Itchy & Scratchy\" segment, were added to pad out the episode. There was originally a sequence where Bart, Lisa and Shary visit Patty and Selma who sing \"We Love to Smoke\", a parody of \"I Love to Laugh\". The song was cut because it wasn't getting any laughs but the full version was included on the album \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\" and a brief animated version was included as a deleted scene on the Season 8 DVD. During the end song, Homer can be seen dancing along but not singing; this was because the producers forgot to record Dan Castellaneta. Many of the scenes were animated by Eric Stefani, a former member of No Doubt, who specialized in animation for musical numbers.\n\nJulie Andrews (who portrayed the titular role in \"Mary Poppins\") was originally slated to appear in the episode as Shary, but in the end, the producers went with series regular Maggie Roswell after hearing Roswell's reading for the part. Quentin Tarantino was also asked to guest star, but he did not want to deliver the lines required, believing them to be insulting. Instead, regular Dan Castellaneta did the voice.\n\nThe overall plot is a reference to the 1964 Disney film \"Mary Poppins\" and the book series it was adapted from; Shary Bobbins is based on the character Mary Poppins and the episode title is a spoof of the word \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" from the film. Several of the musical numbers are direct parodies of songs from the film, including \"The Perfect Nanny\", \"The Life I Lead\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" and \"Feed the Birds\"; a deleted scene features Patty and Selma singing their version of \"I Love to Laugh\".\n\nThe montage of Marge losing her hair features the song \"Hair\" from the musical of the same name (though the version heard is The Cowsills version). Homer says he has seen \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and believes that some of the candidates for the role of nanny are men in drag. Homer's imagination is a parody of the dancing characters in \"Steamboat Willie\" and features the song \"Turkey in the Straw\". In the park, Groundskeeper Willie is seen singing a cover version of \"Maniac\" by Michael Sembello. The scene where Principal Skinner attempts to sell Jimbo is a reference to a similar scene in the story \"Oliver Twist\", more specifically he yells \"Boy for Sale\", a reference to a song in the musical film adaptation \"Oliver!\"\n\nThe \"Itchy & Scratchy\" short \"Reservoir Cats\" is a parody of the scene in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film \"Reservoir Dogs\" where Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of the police officer. The sequence features the same setting, camera angles and music — \"Stuck in the Middle With You\" by Stealers Wheel. At the end, Itchy and Scratchy dance in a manner similar to that seen in Tarantino's 1994 film \"Pulp Fiction\". Shary and Barney Gumble sing a drunken rendition of Jimmy Buffett's \"Margaritaville\".\n\nKrusty's television special \"Krusty Komedy Klassic\" subtly lampshades the implications from its initials which are the same for the Ku Klux Klan. Krusty's \"Mad About Shoe\" joke is a reference to the NBC sitcom \"Mad About You\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\" finished 38th in ratings for the week of February 3–9, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.5 million viewing households. It was the third-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-files\" and \"King of the Hill\".\n\nAlf Clausen received an Emmy Award nomination for \"Outstanding Music Direction\" for this episode.\n\nIn 2014, writers for the series picked \"Reservoir Cats\" from this episode as one of their nine favorite \"Itchy & Scratchy\" episodes of all time.\n\n"}
{"id": "1805175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805175", "title": "Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven", "text": "Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven\n\nAnne Stanley (May 1580 – c. 8 October 1647) was an English noblewoman. She was the eldest daughter of the Earl of Derby and through her two marriages first became Baroness Chandos and later Countess of Castlehaven. She was a distant relative of Elizabeth I of England and for some time was seen as a possible heiress to the English throne.\n\nIn 1630, her second husband, the Earl of Castlehaven, was arrested and charged with being an accomplice to her rape by a servant. He was also accused of sodomy. Lord Castlehaven was found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nAnne Stanley's testimony against her husband was crucial in ensuring his conviction and set the precedent that a wife could give evidence against her husband. After the trial Anne Stanley lived a very secluded life; her reputation had been severely damaged by the scandal.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, there has been a renewal of interest in the Castlehaven affair and in Anne Stanley, especially from the perspective of LGBT and gender studies.\n\nAnne Stanley was the daughter of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (1559-1594), and Alice Spencer (1556-1637).\n\nThe Earls of Derby were among the most influential and prominent noble families in England. Ferdinando Stanley was a great-grandson of Mary Tudor, the younger sister of King Henry VIII. Henry VIII had stipulated in his will that in the line of succession Mary's descendants would follow immediately after his own children. In doing so, he excluded the kings of Scotland, descendants of his elder sister Margaret. By 1580, it was obvious that Queen Elizabeth I would have no children, and this focussed attention on the Earl of Derby as a possible future king. After his death in 1594 opinion in the matter of the succession began to favour King James VI of Scotland, who in 1603 indeed succeeded Elizabeth I. However, some believed that this succession was contrary to the will of Henry VIII, and therefore illegal. Anne Stanley herself never made a claim to the throne.\n\nAnne Stanley was the eldest of three daughters. When Ferdinando Stanley died, they inherited his considerable fortune. The title Earl of Derby went to his younger brother William. For Anne and her sisters Frances and Elizabeth prestigious husbands were sought. Frances married John Egerton, who became the 1st Earl of Bridgewater; Elizabeth married Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon. There were plans for Anne to marry a son of the Tsar of Muscovy. This marriage did not come about, and in 1607 she married the very wealthy Gray Brydges, Baron Chandos of Sudeley, who was known as the King of the Cotswolds. She lived with him in great style in Sudeley Castle. They had at least five children.\n\nThe Dowager Countess of Derby and her three daughters had access to an extensive network of highly influential people, including the royal court. The Dowager Countess and her daughter Elizabeth, Countess of Huntingdon, were politically active and promoted the interests of their family through that network. All four Stanley women were interested in drama and poetry, and supported theatre groups, writers and poets, including Edmund Spenser, John Donne and John Milton.\n\nIn 1621 Anne Stanley's husband Baron Chandos died. Three years later she married the widower Mervyn Touchet, Earl of Castlehaven (ca. 1593-1631). This marriage was controversial. The title Earl of Castlehaven had only been granted to the Touchet family in 1616. Furthermore, it was a title in the Irish peerage and therefore seen by the old English aristocracy as somewhat inferior. Lord Castlehaven was also more than ten years younger than his new wife, had previously shown to harbour Catholic sympathies and generally not behaved in the manner expected of a nobleman. It was felt that Anne Stanley, who was connected to the most important and oldest noble families of England, had married beneath her. However, Lord Castlehaven was rich and Anne Stanley was described by her mother as a spendthrift.\n\nThe Earl and Countess of Castlehaven lived mainly in Fonthill Gifford, the country seat of the Touchets in southern England. Some time after their marriage Anne Stanley's eldest daughter Elizabeth Brydges married James, the eldest son of Lord Castlehaven (1612-1684) who used the courtesy title Lord Audley. Elizabeth was probably twelve years old at the time. It was not unusual for a stepbrother and stepsister to marry, as a way to ensure that wealth remained within the family. The marriage was not a success and Lord Audley left Fonthill Gifford while his wife Elizabeth continued to live there.\n\nIn 1630 Lord Audley, Lord Castlehaven's son, appealed to the Privy Council stating that his father was planning to disown him. Audley claimed that his father had encouraged his (Audley's) wife Elizabeth to have sex with Henry Skipwith, a favorite servant of Castlehaven's. Should Elizabeth become pregnant by Skipwith, Castlehaven planned to make this child his heir, thus depriving his own son of his inheritance. Audley also stated that his stepmother Anne Stanley behaved in a lewd manner and had taken servants as her lovers.\n\nThe Privy Council started an investigation in November 1630 and interviewed family members and servants at Fonthill Gifford. Elizabeth Audley admitted to having been coerced by her father-in-law into having a sexual relationship with Skipwith. According to Elizabeth Audley, her mother Anne Stanley had been raped by one of the servants at the instigation of Lord Castlehaven. When questioned about this, Anne Stanley testified that soon after their marriage, Castlehaven had declared that as a husband he had absolute control over his wife's body, and that she was obliged to do whatever he demanded. He had ordered her several times to sleep with one of his servants, but she had always refused. Eventually, Castlehaven had ordered the page Giles Broadway to rape her in his presence; he had assisted in the rape by restraining his wife. Anne Stanley stated that she had made a suicide attempt after the rape, but she had never discussed the incident with anyone.\n\nThe inhabitants of Fonthill Gifford told the Privy Council's investigators that Lord Castlehaven had sexual relations with both male and female staff, including the footman Lawrence Fitzpatrick, and that he was a voyeur. He showered sexual partners with gifts and had his eldest daughter marry one of his favorites, who had joined the household as a page. Anne Stanley's account of the rape and her subsequent suicide attempt was confirmed, also by the alleged rapist Giles Broadway. The investigators recorded only the testimony of male servants; women were considered unreliable witnesses, especially if they were of lower class.\n\nLord Castlehaven was formally charged with the rape of his wife and sodomy with the servant Lawrence Fitzpatrick on 6 April 1631. He was imprisoned in the Tower and his properties were confiscated by the Crown. Giles Broadway was charged with the rape of Anne Stanley, and Lawrence Fitzpatrick was charged with sodomy. Anne Stanley was ordered by the Privy Council to temporarily take up residence with the Bishop of Winchester. Her younger children from her first marriage were placed in the care of their grandmother, the Dowager Countess of Derby. The Dowager Countess was not prepared to take in her granddaughter Elizabeth, Lady Audley, whom she feared would be a bad influence on her younger siblings.\n\nLord Castlehaven denied all charges and claimed his wife and son were conspiring against him. He called his wife a whore, to whose statements no value should be attached, and accused her of having given birth to an illegitimate child during their marriage. The servants who had made incriminating statements against him had done so out of spite and jealousy, he said.\n\nIn the 17th century, rape and sodomy were seen as serious, morally reprehensible crimes; they were capital offences but prosecution and convictions were rare. It was certainly unusual for a peer to be prosecuted for either rape or sodomy. Prosecution for rape occurred mainly if another offense had also been committed, or if the rape was considered to be a flagrant violation of social order. Rape within marriage was not recognized by law; the charge of rape made against Lord Castlehaven related to his complicity in the rape of Anne Stanley by Giles Broadway. In the case of people of high rank, the charge of sodomy was usually added to charges such as conspiracy or corruption, and served mainly to raise doubts about the moral character of the accused.\n\nThe trial of Lord Castlehaven was remarkable in that the judges explicitly ruled that a woman could testify against her husband in criminal proceedings, especially if she was a victim. This had previously not been clear under English law and set an important precedent. In response to a question by Lord Castlehaven whether it could legally be called rape if the victim was a woman of loose morals, the judges responded that the reputation of the woman did not matter. They also ruled that it was irrelevant that Anne Stanley herself had never spoken out about the rape by Broadway.\n\nThe trial of Lord Castlehaven began on 25 April 1631 and lasted just one day. The jury consisted of 27 men from the nobility. Of these, at least ten had close ties to the Stanley family. There is little doubt that Anne Stanley's influential mother and sisters made efforts to influence the case in their favour. Anne Stanley and her daughter Elizabeth Audley did not appear in court; it was unthinkable that a noblewoman would speak publicly about sexual matters. Their statements were read out. The prosecutors emphasized the fact that Lord Castlehaven's behaviour was immoral and unworthy of a nobleman. On 26 April the jury unanimously found Lord Castlehaven guilty of rape, and a majority also found him guilty of sodomy. He was sentenced to death.\n\nThe Touchet family urged King Charles I to pardon Lord Castlehaven, arguing that Anne Stanley was a promiscuous woman and an unreliable witness. The King, however, refused, and Castlehaven was beheaded on 14 May 1631 on Tower Hill. He maintained his innocence to the last.\n\nThe trial of Giles Broadway and Lawrence Fitzpatrick took place in June 1631. Both withdrew the confessions they had made during the trial of Lord Castlehaven, possibly because they had been falsely promised immunity, and claimed they were innocent. Anne Stanley was present in court to declare under oath that her recorded statement was true. Broadway was found guilty of rape, and Fitzpatrick found guilty of sodomy. They were hanged on 6 July 1631. On the scaffold, Broadway declared Anne Stanley to be the most wicked woman who ever lived; he claimed she had sexual relations with servants and had killed her own child.\n\nAfter the execution of her husband, Anne Stanley withdrew from public life. She always maintained that she was blameless. However, already during the trial pamphlets had been published which questioned her innocence, or even identified her as the evil mastermind behind the events in Fonthill Gifford. Lord Castlehaven's sister, the poet and Protestant prophetess Eleanor Davies Touchet, wrote a number of these leaflets. The fact that both Lord Castlehaven and Giles Broadway had portrayed her as immoral and evil minutes before they were executed further damaged her reputation.\n\nIn the years after the trial, Anne Stanley lived with her mother, the Dowager Countess of Derby, who managed to obtain a formal pardon from the King for Anne Stanley's \"sexual immorality and debauchery\". It was common at that time to grant pardons when people had transgressed against their will.\n\nThe possessions of the Earl of Castlehaven were confiscated by the Crown after his death. Anne Stanley was financially dependent on the income she still received from the estate of her first husband, and on the support from her mother and brothers-in-law. After the death of her mother in 1637, she moved to Heydons House in Harefield, where she died in 1647.\n\nIt is widely assumed that the masque Comus by John Milton refers to the Castlehaven scandal. This work describes the triumph of chastity over debauchery; it was written by Milton in 1634 for the Earl of Bridgewater, who was married to Anne Stanley's sister Frances.\n\nThe trial of Lord Castlehaven remained notorious well into the 18th century. In the 17th century it was often presented in an anti-Catholic or anti-monarchist context. In the 18th century it was cited as an example of immoral behavior by the aristocracy. After about 1750 the case was largely forgotten, though it remained known by legal historians.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Castlehaven affair has been rediscovered, especially by scholars in the field of LGTB- and gender studies. It is now seen as an important landmark in the development of the relationship between the state and sexuality, and a step in the recognition of the position of women under the law.\n\nAnne Stanley and her first husband Gray Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos of Sudeley, had the following children \n"}

This serial marked the departure of Bonnie Langford as Mel Bush and the introduction of Sophie Aldred as companion Ace.\n\nIn the serial, the criminal Kane (Edward Peel) has been exiled to the planet Svartos, where he remained for three thousand years. He seeks to find the power source for his prison ship, which has since become a trading colony called Iceworld, so he can use it to return to his home planet.\n\nThe Seventh Doctor and Mel arrive at the trading colony Iceworld on the dark side of the planet Svartos. They soon run into Sabalom Glitz, who is on Svartos to work off a debt that he owes to the crime lord Kane, and is preparing to explore the depths of Svartos to locate a treasure reportedly protected by a dragon, aided by a map given to him by Kane; in exchange, Kane will return Glitz' ship, the \"Nosferatu\", and clear him of his debts. The Doctor and Mel offer to help, but Glitz asserts the expedition is too dangerous for Mel, and she stays behind at a local diner. She befriends Ace, a young woman who turns out to have actually come from 20th-century Earth, propelled forward in time when a mysterious time storm appeared in her bedroom while she was trying to experiment with \"Nitro-9\", an explosive of her own creation. The two eventually become weary of waiting and follow the Doctor and Glitz.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Glitz follow Glitz' map, unaware that Kane has implanted a tracking and listening device into it. Kane controls a large number of beings that had been unable to repay their debts, their memories wiped and turned into cold-proof henchmen from Kane's touch. Kane has a number of these follow the Doctor and Glitz as to grab the treasure once it is found. The Doctor and Glitz eventually encounter the \"dragon\", but which turns out to be a biomechanoid that can shoot lasers from its eyes. When Mel and Ace arrive and pursued by Kane's men, the \"dragon\" helps to protect the two and defeat the men. The \"dragon\" leads the four to a control room where it plays a holographic message. The message explains that Kane is one half of the Kane-Xana criminal gang from the planet Proamon. They were chased down by authorities, and Xana, Kane's lover, killed herself in the process, while Kane was exiled to Svartos. The message continues that the Iceworld spaceport is really a giant spacecraft, whose power source lies in the \"dragon\"'s head, and Kane seeks this as to be able to escape Svartos. The Doctor suspects Kane must have been trapped here for millennia.\n\nKane, overhearing this, sends more of his forces to seize the \"dragon\"'s head, while causing chaos among the spaceport, including destroying the \"Nosferatu\" with numerous escaping passengers aboard. Kane's men succeed in decapitating the dragon before they are killed, and Kane using a communicator to tell the Doctor and the others to bring him the head. The Doctor does so, accompanied by his allies. Kane use the head to initiate Iceworld's engines and it detaches itself from the planet. Kane attempts to set course to Proamon, but finds the computers unable to do so; the Doctor explains that Proamon was destroyed a thousand years after Kane was exiled on Svartos. With no hope, Kane purposely allows his body to be exposed to the light of the nearby star, melting and killing him. \n\nAs order is restored on Iceworld, Glitz declares himself owner of the vessel, and renames it \"Nosferatu II\". Mel decides to stay with Glitz, while the Doctor offers to take Ace home to Perivale via the \"scenic route\".\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"Absolute Zero\", \"The Pyramid's Treasure\" and \"Pyramid in Space\". In one scene, the Doctor distracts a guard by engaging him in a philosophical conversation. One of the guard's lines, about the \"semiotic thickness of a performed text\", is a quotation from \"Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text\", a 1983 media studies volume by John Tulloch and Manuel Alvarado. Story editor Andrew Cartmel had suggested that writers read \"The Unfolding Text\" to familiarise themselves with \"Doctor Who\" and its history, which inspired Ian Briggs to quote the academic text in his script, in a playful self-reference.\n\nThe literal cliffhanger at the end of episode 1 in which the Doctor lowers himself over a guard rail to dangle over an abyss from his umbrella for no apparent reason comes under frequent criticism for its seeming absurdity. As scripted, the Doctor did have a logical motivation for his actions. According to Cartmel in a later interview, the passage leading to the cliff was meant to be a dead end, leaving the Doctor no option but to scale the cliff face. As shot, however, this reasoning became unclear.\n\nFor the effects shot of the death of Kane, a wax bust of the actor's screaming face was made and filmed being melted down to a skull within, this footage being sped up to achieve the effect. Though this is very similar to the death of Toht in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", for the family audience of \"Doctor Who\" the colour red was carefully avoided in the bust. Ronald Lacey, who had portrayed Toht in the film, was director Chris Clough's first choice to play Kane, but was unavailable John Alderton and David Jason were also considered for the part of Kane, but neither were available for the role.\n\nOn UK Gold (now known as Gold) in 2003 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of \"Doctor Who\", over a weekend DrWho@40weekend was shown which consisted of the best serials of each Doctor voted by the viewing public. \"Dragonfire\" was the serial chosen as the best Seventh Doctor serial. DrWho@40weekend also included interviews with the cast and crew of the series overall. The Doctor Who Appreciation Society voted the serial to be the best one of its season.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping said the serial was \"An interesting attempt to do what \"Doctor Who\" does best: mix monsters with semiotics and philosophy. It doesn't quite come off, but it's a very useful launch vehicle for Ace (despite some overdone dialogue).\" David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were critical of the cliffhanger end to episode one, \"which must surely be the most ludicrous ever presented in \"Doctor Who\".\" They conceded, however that \"\"Dragonfire\" actually succeeds in a great many respects. One of the principal reasons for this is that all the cast seem to take their parts seriously.\"\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Briggs, was published by Target Books in March 1989.\n\n\"Dragonfire\" was released on VHS in early February 1994. It was released on DVD on 7 May 2012, coupled with \"The Happiness Patrol\" as part of the \"\"Ace Adventures\"\" box set. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 123 on 18 September 2013.\n"}
{"id": "1805180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805180", "title": "The Dungeon of Doom", "text": "The Dungeon of Doom\n\nThe Dungeon of Doom was the name of a heel professional wrestling stable in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) who existed from 1995 to 1997.\n\nThe Dungeon of Doom was created as a stable of wrestlers born from WCW lead producer Kevin Sullivan's (kayfabe) hatred of Hulk Hogan and was dedicated to ridding WCW of \"Hulkamania\". The stable was a direct continuation of Sullivan's previous stable The Three Faces of Fear which had a similar goal. The \"actual\" goal was the opposite. Sullivan stated in 2016, \"It was a means to an end. I knew Hogan was being booed. I knew when I saw The nWo, it was the best chance anybody had to turn Hogan. I said, \"You gotta trust me.\" And he did. I [agree with] Satchel Paige. \"Don't look back. Something may be gaining on you.\" You can't change the past. The end justified the means, so in that way, it worked.\"\n\nAfter Sullivan defeated The Man with No Name at Slamboree in 1995, The Master told Sullivan he was \"The Taskmaster\" of the Dungeon of Doom and that the task was to destroy \"Hulkamania\". The group initially consisted of people with rather bizarre and “horrifying” gimmicks such as The Shark (who had teamed with Sullivan before as \"Avalanche\"), Kamala “The Ugandan Giant”, The Zodiac (who had also teamed with Sullivan before as \"The Butcher\"), Meng (who was Col. Robert Parker's bodyguard), and Big Van Vader who also sought to destroy \"Hulkamania\" and began his “Road Kill Tour” which consisted of a series of squash matches that would lead to his destruction of Hogan. After Vader lost to Hogan, the Master revealed that it was etched in stone that a Giant would destroy HulkaMania, thus leading to several encounters with The Giant, who, claimed to be the son of André the Giant and was out for revenge on Hogan for defeating his father.\n\nThe feud between the Dungeon of Doom and Hogan with his friends; Dave Sullivan, Sting, and the Macho Man persisted throughout the fall and winter of 95-96 with various members taking on each other with mostly Hogan's group getting the upper hand. Kevin Sullivan tried to use Vader as a pawn against Hogan but it eventually backfired after a confrontation between Vader and the Giant leading to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl between the entire Dungeon and Hogan's allies. Vader agreed to be on Hogan's team, however, he became injured and Sting suggested Lex Luger take his place. Macho and Hogan reluctantly agreed as there was already distrust towards Luger. Hogan, Randy Savage, Lex Luger and Sting defeated Kamala, The Zodiac, The Shark, and Meng to win the match, which per stipulation enabled Hogan to get 5 minutes with Sullivan inside the cage. Before the 5 minutes were up, however, the Giant made his way into the cage and attacked Hogan, (kayfabe) twisting his neck violently as to break it.\n\nAfter the attack on Hogan, plans were set for a world title match at the Halloween Havoc. During this time the Dungeon shaved Hogan's iconic mustache and succeeded in bringing out the evil within him causing him to don all black instead of his signature red and yellow attire with Macho Man soon following suit. The Master of the Dungeon insured Kevin Sullivan that the giant would beat Hogan by summoning The Yeti from a block of ice. During WCW Fall Brawl, the Giant used a monster truck to run over Hogan's motorcycle, which led to Hogan and the Giant facing off in a Sumo Monster truck competition on the roof of the Cobo Hall. Hogan won the truck match and then the two started fighting on the roof, resulting in the Giant falling off the roof and (kayfabe) into the Detroit River. For the main event Hogan was trying to apologize but the Giant strolled down the aisle with Kevin Sullivan behind him, with no explanation given as to how he could still be alive. The Giant won the match by disqualification when Hogan's manager Jimmy Hart hit the referee with the title belt, thus betraying Hogan and joining the Dungeon along with Lex Luger who also betrayed Hogan that night. Macho Man came to Hogan's aide after the match but Hogan was assaulted by The Yeti and the Dungeon members beat on Macho Man The next night, Hart revealed that he put a clause in the contract that stated that the championship could change hands on a disqualification, thus making the Giant the new champion.\n\nDue to the unconventional nature of The Giant's title victory, the World Title was vacated and a new champion to be crowned in a Three Ring, 60 man battle royal at an event called World War III. The Hulk Hogan / Dungeon of Doom feud was a focus of the Battle Royal but it would be Randy Savage who won the title, after Hogan, Luger, and Sting eliminated Dungeon member the Giant However, Hogan was never eliminated. The Giant got revenge by assaulting Macho Man, as Hogan and Sting fended him off, Hogan was put on probation for hitting the Giant with a chair repeatedly. Luger remained a source of dissent between Hogan, Macho Man and Sting with Sting explaining that Luger was his best friend and he was trying to pull Luger away from the Dungeon, while Jimmy Hart assured the Taskmaster he had a plan to keep Luger on their side. In the long term, Luger distracted Sting from helping Hogan and Savage. During this time period, the Dungeon had been joined by Loch Ness, Hugh Morrus, Barbarian, Big Bubba Rogers, and One Man Gang. On the January 22 edition of WCW Monday Nitro, Gang lost to Hogan. Following the match, the Dungeon of Doom and the Horsemen in attacked Hogan and Randy Savage. At SuperBrawl VI, Hogan defeated The Giant inside a steel cage and was confronted by the rest of the Dungeon including, Loch Ness.\n\nDuring the spring of 1996, Dungeon of Doom member Zodiac began warding the Giant away from Hogan. Soon after, Hogan revealed that the man known as \"The Zodiac\" was actually a spy sent to join the group by Hogan; his old friend had been spying for Hulk the whole time. The revelation transformed the Zodiac into the Booty Man, an ally of Hogan and Randy Savage. the Taskmaster confronted Ric Flair after Four Horsemen member Brian Pillman said some disparaging words towards the Dungeon of Doom. This led to some brief altercations between the two factions until Ric Flair forged the Alliance to End Hulkamania (which consisted of several Dungeon members as well as Ric Flair and Arn Anderson). At this point, the \"Alliance\" became the focal point while the Dungeon of Doom itself became less prominent. As tensions were brewing between Hogan and Savage as to who would challenge Flair for the world title, they engaged in a series of team matches against Flair and a Dungeon member, some of which the Booty Man was a part of. The Dungeon of Doom expanded its roster by bringing in Z-Gangsta and the Ultimate Solution, attempting to defeat Hogan and Savage once and for all.\n\nMeanwhile, Lex Luger's only ties to the Dungeon were his manager Jimmy Hart who seemingly persuaded Luger to join the Alliance, and the match as a final favor in their fading relationship. A grudge between the Giant and Loch Ness soon developed over who was the only true Giant of WCW. This ended with Giant beating Loch Ness at the Uncensored event that month. Hogan and Savage defeated the Alliance to End Hulkamania at Uncensored inside the Tower of Doom Steel Cage. The Booty man proved to be a key factor in Hogan and Savage's victory by supplying them with weapons towards the end of the match. Luger would also prove to be a major factor in the outcome, and would no longer be associated with the Dungeon. After the loss, the Alliances fell apart, as the Taskmaster started feuding with Horsemen member Chris Benoit, the Giant was confronted by Luger after attacking Sting as part of Jimmy Hart's plan to separate the duo, and the Shark would face Luger one on one, and both the Giant and Luger challenged Flair for the title, with the Giant eventually beating Flair. The feud between the Dungeon and Four Horsemen, along with Shark going solo as John Tenta, and The Giant and Big Bubba's defection to the nWo, would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Dungeon. Chris Benoit defeated Sullivan in a Retirement Match at Bash at the Beach 1997 after Jacqueline turned on Sullivan and hit him over the head with a chair, leading to Benoit scoring the pinfall. Jimmy Hart would continue to manage the Faces of Fear, Meng and the Barbarian, for several months until the team was broken up in 1998.\n\nIn late 1998, Jimmy Hart reunited Meng, Barbarian and Hugh Morrus to form a new version of his old Continental Wrestling Association stable The First Family. Barbarian would inexplicably turn on Meng during a match in a WCW World Tag Team Championship tournament match on the February 11, 1999 episode of \"WCW Thunder\".\n\nKevin Sullivan established a new version of the Dungeon of Doom in the New York City-based independent USA Pro Wrestling promotion in 2002. This version consisted of Gangrel, Luna Vachon, The Wall, Psycho Sam Dudley and \"Hardrock\" Ken Sweeney.\n\nNon Members but associated with the Dungeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Known in adult life as Hertha Ayrton, born Phoebe Sarah Marks, she was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripples in sand and water.\n\nHertha Ayrton was born Phoebe Sarah Marks in Portsea, Hampshire, England, on 28 April 1854. She was the third child of a Polish Jewish watchmaker named Levi Marks, an immigrant from Tsarist Poland; and Alice Theresa Moss, a seamstress, the daughter of Joseph Moss, a glass merchant of Portsea. Her father died in 1861, leaving Sarah's mother with seven children and an eighth expected. Sarah then took up some of the responsibility for caring for the younger children.\n\nAt the age of nine, Sarah was invited by her aunts, who ran a school in northwest London, to live with her cousins and be educated with them. She was known to her peers and teachers as a fiery, occasionally crude personality. Her cousins introduced Ayrton to science and mathematics. By age 16, she was working as a governess.\n\nAt Girton, Ayrton studied mathematics and was coached by physicist Richard Glazebrook. George Eliot supported Ayrton's application to Girton College. During her time at Cambridge, Ayrton constructed a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure meter), led the choral society, founded the Girton fire brigade, and, together with Charlotte Scott, formed a mathematical club. In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos, but Cambridge did not grant her an academic degree because, at the time, Cambridge gave only certificates and not full degrees to women. Ayrton passed an external examination at the University of London, which awarded her a Bachelor of Science degree in 1881.\n\nUpon her return to London, Ayrton earned money by teaching and embroidery, ran a club for working girls, and cared for her invalid sister. She also put her mathematical skills to practical use – she taught at Notting Hill and Ealing High School, and was also active in devising and solving mathematical problems, many of which were published in \"Mathematical Questions and Their Solutions\" from the \"Educational Times\". In 1884 Ayrton patented a line-divider, an engineering drawing instrument for dividing a line into any number of equal parts and for enlarging and reducing figures. The line-divider was her first major invention and, while its primary use was likely for artists for enlarging and diminishing, it was also useful to architects and engineers. Ayrton's patent application was financially supported by Louisa Goldsmid and feminist Barbara Bodichon, who together advanced her enough money to take out patents; the invention was shown at the Exhibition of Women's Industries and received much press attention. Ayrton's 1884 patent was the first of many – from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air.\n\nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes on electricity at Finsbury Technical College, delivered by Professor William Edward Ayrton, a pioneer in electrical engineering and physics education and a fellow of the Royal Society. On 6 May 1885 she married her former teacher, and thereafter assisted him with experiments in physics and electricity. She also began her own investigation into the characteristics of the electric arc.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for \"the Electrician\", explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was in 1958. She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901. Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc. By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of electrical engineering was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900. Her success there led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees.\n\nIn 1902, Ayrton published \"The Electric Arc\", a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from \"the Electrician\" published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of electrical engineering began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the Royal Society. In the aftermath of the publication of \"The Electric Arc\", Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer John Perry in 1902. Her application was turned down by the Council of the Royal Society, who decreed that married women were not eligible to be Fellows. However, in 1904, she became the first woman to read a paper before the Royal Society when she was allowed to read her paper \"The Origin and Growth of Ripple Marks\" and this was later published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. In 1906, she was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Hughes Medal \"for her experimental investigations on the electric arc, and also on sand ripples.\" She was the fifth recipient of this prize, awarded annually since 1902, in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications, and as of 2018, one of only two women so honoured, the other being Michele Dougherty in 2008.\n\nAs a teenager, Ayrton became deeply involved in the women's suffrage movement, joining the WSPU in 1907 after attending a celebration with released prisoners. In 1909 Ayrton opened the second day of the Knightsbridge \"Women's Exhibition and Sale of Work in the Colours\" which included new model bicycles painted in purple, white and green and raised from 50 stalls and tea etc. £5,664 for the movement. Ayrton was with the delegation that went with Mrs Emily Pankhurst to see the Prime Minister and met his private secretary instead on 18 November 1910 (Black Friday). Ayrton permitted Christabel Pankhurst to transfer sums to her bank account to avoid confiscation in 1912, and hosted Mrs Pankhurst in times of recovery from imprisonment and force feeding. One attempt to re-arrest Mrs Pankhurst on 29 April 1913 to continue her sentence, was driven back by suffragettes picketing outside, but Mrs Pankhurst was eventually re-arrested outside Ayrton's home on her way to the funeral of Emily Davison (who was killed after running in front of the King's horse at the Derby).\n\nAyrton was a close friend of the scientist Marie Curie, and she gave her daughter, Irène Curie, Mathematics lessons. Although Curie typically opted to withhold her name from any petitions, Ayrton managed to persuade her to sign a protest against the imprisonment of suffragettes through her daughter.\n\nIt was through suffrage activism, she met suffragist and co-founder of Cambridge's Girton College, Barbara Bodichon. Bodichon helped make it financially possible to attend Girton, and would go on to financially support Ayrton throughout her education and career including by bequeathing her estate to Ayrton.\n\nAyrton delivered seven papers before the Royal Society between 1901 and 1926, the last posthumously.\n\nShe also presented the results of her research before audiences at the British Association and the Physical Society. Ayrton's interest in vortices in water and air inspired the Ayrton fan, or flapper, used in the trenches in the First World War to dispel poison and foul gas. Ayrton fought for its acceptance which took a year from her offering it to the War Office to being used in the forces in 1916, and organised its production, over 100,000 being used on the Western Front.\n\nAyrton helped found the International Federation of University Women in 1919 and the National Union of Scientific Workers in 1920. She died of blood poisoning (resulting from an insect bite) on 26 August 1923 at New Cottage, North Lancing, Sussex.\n\nHertha Ayrton was agnostic. In her teens she adopted the name \"Hertha\" after the eponymous heroine of a by Algernon Charles Swinburne that criticised organised religion.\n\nIn 1885, Ayrton married the widower William Edward Ayrton, a physicist and electrical engineer who was supportive of her scientific endeavours. Ayrton honoured Barbara Bodichon by naming her first child, a daughter born in 1886, Barbara Bodichon Ayrton (1886–1950). The daughter was called \"Barbie\", and she later became a member of parliament for the Labour Party. Her daughter's son was the artist, Michael Ayrton.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Those elected served in the 110th United States Congress from January 3, 2007, until January 3, 2009. The incumbent majority party, the Republicans, had won majorities in the House consecutively since 1994, and were defeated by the Democrats who won a majority in the chamber, ending 12 years of Republican control in the House.\n\nThe Republicans had won a 232-seat majority in 2004. By the time of the 2006 election, they held 229 seats, while the Democrats held 201, plus 1 Independent who caucused with the Democrats. There were also four vacancies. Republicans held a 28-seat advantage, and Democrats needed to pick up 15 seats to take control of the House, which had had a Republican majority since January 1995. The public's perception of George W. Bush, the handling of the war in Iraq, and a series of political scandals involving mostly congressional Republicans took their toll on the party at the ballot box.\n\nThe final result was a 31-seat pickup for the Democrats, including the pickup of the Vermont at-large seat, previously held by Independent Bernie Sanders (who ran instead for U.S. Senate), who caucused with the Democrats. Democrats defeated 22 Republican incumbents and won eight open Republican-held seats. For the first time since the party's founding, Republicans won no seats previously held by Democrats and defeated no Democratic incumbents. It was the largest seat gain for the Democrats since the 1974 elections. Among the new Democrats were the first Muslim in Congress (Keith Ellison) and the first two Buddhists (Mazie Hirono and Hank Johnson).

The title \"Racovian\" comes from the publishers, the Polish Brethren, who had founded a sizeable town in Raków, Kielce County, where the Racovian Academy and printing press was founded by Jakub Sienieński in 1602.\n\nThe Polish Brethren or \"Ecclesia Minor\" were an antitrinitarian minority of the Reformed Church in Poland who had separated from the Calvinist majority, or \"Ecclesia Major\", in 1565.\n\nSeveral authors had a hand in drafting the Catechism: Valentinus Smalcius, Hieronim Moskorzowski, Johannes Völkel and others. It is likely that some of the text had been prepared by the Italian exile Fausto Sozzini, who had settled among the Polish Brethren in 1579, without ever formally joining, and who died in the year before the Catechism was drafted. Despite his lack of any official status in the church Sozzini had been influential in bringing the Polish church round to a Christology which closely resembled what he had learnt from his uncle Lelio Sozzini in exile in Switzerland as a young man.\n\nThe Racovian Catechism was published in 1605, and subsequently translated into other languages. Smalcius produced a German version.\n\nThe \"Ecclesia Minor\" survived in Poland until 1656 when it was outlawed by the Polish Sejm in the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation. These nontrinitarians, and their Catechism, would later become known as Socinians due to the prominence given to Fausto Sozzini's writings after his death in the series \"Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum\" published in Amsterdam 1665 and widely circulated in England and elsewhere.\n\nOn April 2, 1652 The English Parliament voted to seize and burn all copies circulating.\n\nA revised Latin edition of the Racovian catechism appeared in 1680 in Amsterdam, revised by Sozzini's grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr. and great-grandson Benedykt Wiszowaty. This was the base of Thomas Rees' 1818 English translation.\n\nPreface\n\nThe most distinctive element in Socinian, as opposed to Arian, Christology is the rejection of the personal pre-existence of Christ. The theme of Christ's preexistence occurs repeatedly in the Racovian Catechism, with detailed discussion of disputed verses, such as:\nMost early Socinians accepted the infallibility of the New Testament and so accepted the account of the literal virgin birth of Jesus, but many later Socinians (i.e., Unitarians) did not.\n\nThe Racovian Catechism makes muted reference to the devil in seven places which prompts the 1818 translator Thomas Rees, to footnote references to the works of Hugh Farmer (1761) and John Simpson (1804). Yet these references are in keeping with the somewhat subdued handling of the devil in the \"Biblioteca Fratrum Polonorum\". The Collegia Vicentina at Vicenza (1546) had questioned not only the existence of the devil but even of angels.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805214", "title": "Non-invasive ventilation", "text": "Non-invasive ventilation\n\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the use of breathing support administered through a face mask, nasal mask, or a helmet. Air, usually with added oxygen, is given through the mask under positive pressure; generally the amount of pressure is alternated depending on whether someone is breathing in or out. It is termed \"non-invasive\" because it is delivered with a mask that is tightly fitted to the face or around the head, but without a need for tracheal intubation (a tube through the mouth into the windpipe). While there are similarities with regards to the interface, NIV is not the same as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which applies a single level of positive airway pressure throughout the whole respiratory cycle; CPAP does not deliver ventilation but is occasionally used in conditions also treated with NIV.\n\nNon-invasive ventilation is used in acute respiratory failure caused by a number of medical conditions, most prominently chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); numerous studies have shown that appropriate use of NIV reduces the need for invasive ventilation and its complications. Furthermore, it may be used on a long-term basis in people who cannot breathe independently as a result of a chronic condition.\n\nNIV for acute respiratory failure is used particularly for severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but also for acute decompensated heart failure and other acute conditions. NIV can be used acutely and long-term. In some people who have presented with acute respiratory failure, there is an ongoing need for long-term use of NIV at home.\n\nNon-invasive ventilation has been suggested in the treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) where shortages of invasive ventilation equipment and facilities may arise. The risk of poorly fitting masks emitting aerosols can require full protection gear for caregivers.\n\nThe most common indication for acute non-invasive ventilation is for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The decision to commence NIV, usually in the emergency department, depends on the initial response to medication (bronchodilators given by nebulizer) and the results of arterial blood gas tests. If after medical therapy the lungs remain unable to clear carbon dioxide from the bloodstream (respiratory acidosis), NIV may be indicated. Many people with COPD have chronically elevated CO levels with metabolic compensation, but NIV is only indicated if the CO is acutely increased to the point that the acidity levels of the blood are increased (pH<7.35). There is no level of acidity above which NIV cannot be started, but more severe acidosis carries a higher risk that NIV alone is not effective and that mechanical ventilation will be required instead. \n\nBronchiectasis may lead to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF), and NIV may be used similarly as for COPD. This is particularly the case where the underlying cause is cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis also causes high volumes of sputum (phlegm) which may require specialised physiotherapy assistance and sometimes the insertion of a mini-tracheostomy to clear this.\n\nIn people with chest wall deformity or neuromuscular disease, NIV may be commenced if the CO level is elevated even if it has not yet caused acidosis. In neuromuscular disease, a breathing measurement known as the vital capacity is used to determine a need for breathing support.\n\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) may cause acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. When this is the case, the criteria for commencing acute NIV are similar to those for COPD (decreased pH, elevated CO), although there are some scenarios where NIV may be initiated in hospitalized people despite a normal pH; these include people with daytime somnolence, sleep-disordered breathing and/or evidence of right ventricle heart failure.\n\nIn acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema caused by decompensated heart failure, the quality of evidence is poor but studies have shown a reduced risk of death and a decreased need for tracheal intubation for both NIV and CPAP. Both CPAP and NIV may be used in the prehospital care setting.\n\nAcute severe asthma may cause AHRF, when it is labelled \"near-fatal asthma\". There is limited evidence on whether NIV is effective in this situation, which carries a high risk of requiring mechanical ventilation. Professional guidelines therefore do not give a clear recommendation, and it is suggested that NIV is only used in an intensive care unit setting where further deterioration can be managed immediately, or not at all. Some people with chronic asthma develop fixed airways disease that resembles COPD, and NIV may be used in that setting.\n\nRespiratory failure may develop after major surgery. NIV may be used in this setting during the recovery period. In those who have undergone mechanical ventilation on the intensive care unit and are considered at high risk of recurrence, NIV may be used to prevent this. However, if respiratory failure does develop, recommencement of mechanical ventilation is recommended over NIV to treat this. In those who were ventilated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, NIV may be used to facilitate the weaning process.\n\nChronic use of NIV (\"home NIV\") may be indicated for severe COPD.\n\nHome NIV may also be indicated in people with neuromuscular disease and chest wall deformity.\n\nPeople with obesity hypoventilation syndrome often require NIV initially in their care, but many can be switched to CPAP. American Thoracic Society (ATS) clinical practice guidelines recommend that NIV is provided on discharge with a further sleep study assessment as an outpatient. With regards to initiation of positive pressure treatment, the ATS guidelines recommend that in people being investigated for possible obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, a related condition), measurement of arterial carbon dioxide (in high probability) or venous bicarbonate (in moderate probability) is performed to identify OHS and to determine an indication for treatment. In those with both severe OSA and OHS, initial treatment with CPAP is recommended although the quality of research supporting this over NIV is poor. In the 30% of people with OHS who do not also have severe OSA, NIV may be more effective but is also more cost- and resource-intensive. In those who have both OSA and OHS, poor response to CPAP despite good adherence may be an indication to switch to NIV.\n\nPeople with motor neuron disease (MND) may require home NIV in the course of their illness. Guidelines in the United Kingdom stipulate that assessment of respiratory function is part of the multidisciplinary management of MND.\n\nA number of terms have been used in the medical literature to describe NIV. The more formal name \"non-invasive positive pressure ventilation\" (NPPV or NIPPV) has been used to distinguish it from the use of the now very rare negative pressure ventilator (\"iron lung\"). The brand name BiPAP/BIPAP (for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) has also enjoyed a degree of popularity, after an early NIV machine produced by Respironics, but its use is now discouraged.\n\nNon-invasive ventilation has been used since the 1940s for various indications, but its present-day use for chronic breathing problems arose in the 1980s for people with chronic respiratory muscle weakness, and in the 1990s on intensive care units and other acute care settings for acute respiratory failure.\n\nSince 2000 acute NIV has been used widely in the treatment of acute respiratory failure, particularly in people with COPD, including on general wards rather than the intensive care unit setting. In the United Kingdom, a 2017 report by NCEPOD found that there were widespread problems in the delivery of high-quality care to patients.\n"}

Established by the De La Salle Christian Brothers, SJCI is chartered by the Board of Regents of New York State and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It is a member of the Christian Brothers' Education Association, The College Board, and the National Catholic Education Association. It is located in the town of Tonawanda.\n\nSt. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is a Catholic, independent college-preparatory school educating young men of diverse backgrounds in the tradition of St. John Baptist de La Salle. Through a broad and balanced, human and Christian education, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute guides the development of each student's unique talents, fostering a commitment to academic excellence, service, and leadership in the global community.\n\nThe History of St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is predated by only a few years by that of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, which was established on April 23, 1847. Very Rev John Timon, named the first Bishop of Buffalo by Pope Pius IX, was consecrated in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, on Sunday, October 17 and arrived in Buffalo on October 22, 1847.\n\nIn 1849, Bishop Timon moved into the Webster House on Franklin Street. Always concerned with vocations to the priesthood, he established in the rectory a seminary for three young men. The seminary was named St. Joseph's College because of a special veneration the bishop held for St. Joseph. Its early history was a varied one, as it moved from one location to another in several areas of the city.\n\nLater in 1850., Bishop Timon asked the Oblates of Mary Immaculate to staff the seminary in his residence. On July 2, 1851, the Oblates arrived and opened a school chartered on March 12, 1851 under the name \"The Buffalo College of St. Joseph,\" which Bishop Timon said, \"...exists for missionary and no other purpose.\" In August 1861, six Christian Brothers from New York and Montreal arrived in Buffalo and settled at 187 Terrace Street. Brother Crispian, Director of this first Christian Brothers' community in Buffalo, Brother Pompian (Sub-Director), Brothers Demedrian, Ptolemy, Benedict and one Brother whose religious name is unknown had come to the city in response to Bishop Timon's urgent plea for assistance in educating the Catholic youth of Buffalo.\n\nThe first building in which the Brothers taught was built by a local contractor, a Mr. Flanagan, at a cost of $7,000. Two departments were started in this first school on September 2, 1861: St. Joseph's Academy (a tuition school), with 130 boys registered, and St. Joseph's Free School, with 150 boys. The brick building was located opposite Union Terrace, which at that time was a beautiful park. The Free School was located on the first floor of the building, the Academy on the second floor., and the Brothers dormitory on the third floor. This building, later known as \"Old Cathedral Hall,\" was located at 1 Delaware Avenue.\n\nIn response to numerous requests from clergy and parents, and after being closed for two years, St. Joseph's College reopened in September 1893. Due to the railroad station at Union Terrace and the encroachment of business and manufacturing interests, the Delaware Avenue site was no longer a desirable one. For what they knew would be a temporary stay, the Brothers rented a two-story brick building at 473 Prospect Avenue near Jersey Street which housed about fifty pupils during each of the four years the school occupied it.\n\nIn 1945, plans were again taken up for the \"new St. Joe's\" on Kenmore Avenue. Brother Andrew of the Cross-sponsored a drive to secure funds to commence the project. The proposed plan was to include three buildings: a general school building to accommodate 900 students, a gymnasium with three basketball courts and a seating capacity of 2000, and a faculty house with accommodations for thirty brothers. In addition, there were to be football and baseball fields, a quarter-mile cinder track, and facilities for other sports.\n\nThe first classes were held in the new building on April 19, 1950. In the years to follow, the new facility allowed for increases in both the size of the student body and the number of faculty members. Such facilities as a drafting room, photographic darkroom and a soda fountain were appealing to the students. The school also featured, according to news accounts of the day, such modern innovations\" as a public address system linking the principal's office to all rooms of the school and green glass chalkboards, replacing the old familiar blackboards.\" The new building was dedicated on May 14, 1950.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, it was announced that alumnus Jack Cullen had made a gift of $2 million to support construction of new science laboratories and classrooms, as well as the annual school musical. This gift, along with two other $1 million gifts from alumni, are the foundation for a $12 million capital campaign announced on May 15, 2007, to build new science laboratories, an athletic complex, and a new residence for the Christian Brothers on campus, as well as increasing the endowment for financial aid.\n\nThe campus of St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute (SJCI or St. Joe's) is located at 845 Kenmore Avenue in the town of Tonawanda (near Buffalo) and rests on 11.9 acres (48,000 m²). There are three buildings on the grounds: the Academic Building, Field House, and Innovation Center. The Brothers Residence was torn down in 2008 and is now the site of The Cullen Center for Excellence in Science, which includes a new residence on the top floor.\n\nWithin St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute, there are two academic computer labs, a newly updated Computer Graphics Lab in the art wing, and a Music Lab that employs Mac and Windows computers. The library also contains workstations for internet access. The Fine Arts facility includes a fully functioning black-box theatre, band room and sound-proof practice facilities.\n\nAthletics are also an integral part of the St. Joe’s experience and students are able to take advantage of both indoor and outdoor facilities. A modern weight room, renovated in 2014, two gymnasiums, a field house, and the 183,961 square foot, all-weather artificial turf Robert T. Scott AFSC Athletic Field Complex comprise the facilities of the athletic department. The Cullen Center for Excellence in science building was finished in fall 2009 and is presently in use. Classes include lab stations, smartboards and a work area for each student.\n\nSt. Joseph's Collegiate Institute offers an extensive athletic program consisting of 16 sports, with most sports offering multiple levels of competition. St. Joe's has won the Supremacy Cup, recognizing the top overall athletic program in the Monsignor Martin Athletic Association's AA League, 31 times in the 58 years of the league's existence.\n\nIn addition to interscholastic competition, St. Joe's offers a number of intramural athletic programs and maintains a vocal group of student supporters at their major sports events.\n\nThe Marauders' main rival is Canisius High School.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1805225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805225", "title": "The Happiness Patrol", "text": "The Happiness Patrol\n\nThe Happiness Patrol is the second serial of the 25th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in three weekly parts on BBC1 from 2 to 16 November 1988.\n\nThe serial is set on the Earth colony world Terra Alpha. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) starts a rebellion against the planet's ruler, Helen A (Sheila Hancock), a woman who seeks to eliminate all unhappiness on the planet.\n\nThe Seventh Doctor and Ace visit a human colony on the planet Terra Alpha, where the planet's secret police force, the Happiness Patrol, roam the streets hunting down and killing so-called 'Killjoys'. The colony is governed by Helen A, who is obsessed with eliminating unhappiness. Also in her employment is the Kandy Man, a grotesque, sweet-based robot created by Gilbert M, one of Helen A's senior advisers.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace meet an unhappy guard Susan Q, who becomes an ally, and Earl Sigma, a wandering harmonica player. They, along with the native inhabitants of Terra Alpha, the Pipe People, work to overthrow the tyranny of Helen A. They begin supporting public demonstrations of unhappiness, encouraging the people to revolt, and attempting to expose Helen A's population control programme to Trevor Sigma, an official galactic census taker.\n\nThe first to be disposed of is Helen A’s pet Stigorax, Fifi, a rat-dog creature used to hunt down the Pipe People, as it is crushed in the pipes below the city when Earl causes an avalanche of crystallised sugar with his harmonica. Then the Pipe People destroy the Kandyman in a flow of his own fondant surprise (previously used to execute dissidents). Realising that she is beaten, Helen A attempts to escape the planet in a rocket, only to discover that the rocket has already been commandeered by Gilbert M and Joseph C, her husband. She tries to flee, but the Doctor stops her, and tries to teach her about the true nature of happiness, which can only be understood if counterbalanced by sadness. Helen A at first sneers at the Doctor, but when she discovers the remains of her beloved pet Fifi, she collapses in tears, and finally feels some sadness of her own.\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"The Crooked Smile\". The production team considered transmitting this story in black and white to fit with its intended film noir atmosphere. A fan myth holds that the third episode was supposed to be animated, but this was never the case. The entire serial was shot in studio in July and August 1988.\n\nHelen A was intended to be a caricature of then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Hancock stated that she \"hate[d] Mrs Thatcher with a deep and venomous passion\". In 2010, Sylvester McCoy told the \"Sunday Times\": \"Our feeling was that Margaret Thatcher was far more terrifying than any monster the Doctor had encountered\". The Doctor's calls on the drones to down their tools and revolt was intended as a reference to the 1984-1985 miners' strike. Most of this element was eventually toned down.\n\nIn the story, the Doctor sings \"As Time Goes By\", the song famously sung by Dooley Wilson in the 1942 film \"Casablanca\". John Normington played Morgus in \"The Caves of Androzani\", and later appeared in \"Ghost Machine\", an episode of the \"Doctor Who\" spin-off \"Torchwood\". Lesley Dunlop previously played Norna in 1984's \"Frontios\" and Harold Innocent would go on to appear in the 1993 radio serial \"The Paradise of Death\".\nBassett's complained over the similarity between the Kandy Man in this story and their trademark character. The BBC agreed not to use the Kandy Man again.\n\n\"Radio Times\" reviewer Patrick Mulkern awarded \"The Happiness Patrol\" a full five stars and described it as a \"clever and funny satire\" and praised the acting and political commentary. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave \"The Happiness Patrol\" five out of five stars, calling it a \"minor masterpiece\". He commended the irony, social commentary, and McCoy's acting. Authors Graeme Burk and Robert Smith included \"The Happiness Patrol\" in their 2013 book \"Who's 50: The 50 Doctor Who Stories to Watch Before You Die\". For GamesRadar+ in 2015, Will Salmon included \"The Happiness Patrol\" among \"The strangest \"Doctor Who\" stories\", describing it as an \"infamous Sylvester McCoy story\" that \"is actually rather good, but there's no denying its peculiarity [...] There's lots of interesting stuff going on beneath the surface of this story: anti-war speeches, Orwellian oppression and protests against Section 28. There's little doubt that, nearly 30 years later, it's still one of the most iconoclastic \"Doctor Who\" stories ever. And one of the oddest.\"\n\nIn his book \"Doctor Who: A British Alien?\", which explores the series' use of science fiction allegory and metaphor, Danny Nicol questioned the serial's claimed anti-Thatcherism agenda, stating, \"The part of Helen A was played by Sheila Hancock in a way which served to remind the viewer of Margaret Thatcher, leading to the serial being seen as a satire on the Thatcher governments. Yet Helen A's policies—death squads, executions and the extensive state establishment of sugar factories—bear no relation to Thatcher's, making claims of a Thatcher metaphor less convincing.\" In \"The Discontinuity Guide\", Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping identify a gay subtext to the story: \"there's entrapment over cottaging, the TARDIS is painted pink, and the victim of the fondant surprise is every inch the proud gay man, wearing, as he does, a pink triangle.\" The story ends with Helen A's husband abandoning her and leaving with another man.\n\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, referred to this story in his 2011 Easter sermon, on the subject of happiness and joy. Marc Sidwell has described it as an expression of national unease at rave culture.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by scriptwriter Graeme Curry, was published by Target Books in February 1990. Adapting his scripts rather than the televised version, Curry's book includes scenes cut during editing and his original envisioning of the Kandy Man with a human appearance, albeit with powdery white skin and edible candy-cane glasses. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by Rula Lenska was released by BBC Audiobooks in July 2009.\n\n\"The Happiness Patrol\" was released on VHS on 4 August 1997, by BBC Worldwide. It was then released on DVD on 7 May 2012 alongside \"Dragonfire\" as part of the \"\"Ace Adventures\"\" box set. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 119 on 24 July 2013.\n\n"}

A science fiction and comics fan, Philippe worked as a photographer after graduating from high school, drawing only for his own pleasure.\n\nHis first book appeared in 1966, entitled \"Le Mystère des abîmes\" (\"The Mystery of the Abyss\"). It introduced his recurring hero \"Lone Sloane\" and played on science-fiction themes partially inspired by his favourite writers, H. P. Lovecraft and A.E. van Vogt. Later Druillet created book covers for republications of Lovecraft's work, as well as numerous movie posters.\nAfter Druillet became a regular contributor to the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Pilote\" in 1970, his \"Lone Sloane\" saga grew steadily more flamboyant, as he pursued innovations including bold page designs and computer-generated images. His backdrops of gigantic structures inspired by \"Art Nouveau\", Indian temples and Gothic cathedrals earned him the nickname of \"space architect\". Six tales about Sloane's exploits were collected in \"Les six voyages de Lone Sloane\" in 1972, hailed by many as his masterpiece, and Sloane was again the hero of the graphic novel \"Délirius\" (1973), written by Jacques Lob. In 1973, Druillet also produced the Moorcock's \"Elric\"-inspired \"Yragaël\" for \"Pilote\", and \"Vuzz\" for the magazine \"Phénix\"\n\nIn 1975 Druillet joined Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Bernard Farkas and Moebius to form the publishing house Les Humanoïdes Associés, and the magazine \"Métal Hurlant\". This was to be a vehicle for his finest stories, and showcased a steady evolution in his graphical skills. His series \"Lone Sloane\" and \"Vuzz\" continued, and other stories of this period include \"La Nuit\", and \"Nosferatu\". In 1980 Druillet produced \"Salammbô\", a comic-book trilogy based upon Flaubert's proto-heroic fantasy novel \"Salammbô\".\n\nOutside his work as a cartoonist and illustrator, Druillet has also been active in architecture, rock opera, painting, sculpture and digital art. He worked as a designer on the film, \"Sorcerer\" directed by William Friedkin in 1976. He collaborated on Rolf Liebermann's \"Wagner Space Opera\" in the Opera de Paris in the late '70s to early '80s, and founded the Space Art Création in 1984.

{"id": "1805239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805239", "title": "Poros, Cephalonia", "text": "Poros, Cephalonia\n\nPoros (), is a picturesque small town located in the municipal unit of Eleios-Pronnoi, some 40 km SE of Argostoli, 28 km SE of Sami and 12 km NE of Skala, in the southeast of Cephalonia, one of the Ionian Islands of Greece.\n\nThe community of Poros consists of the villages:\n\nPoros is effectively divided into three parts. Poros port, with its couple of tavernas and bars, connects the island with Kyllini on the Peloponnese area of mainland Greece via regular year-round ferry service. During the summer months a ferry may connect Poros with Zakynthos and a couple of tourist caiques offer cruises to Ithaca and the Blue Caves of Zakynthos. The harbour is also home to the local fishing boats which supply the area with fresh fish.\n\nSeparated from Poros port by a small hillock lies the shingle town beach, backed by a taverna-fringed square and main services: bank, chemist (pharmacy), doctor's surgery, post office, police station and local shops. More tavernas and bars lie along the award-winning 'Blue Flag' beach, Aragia, separated from the centre of Poros by the Vohinas river which, although used as a car park in summer, can be a raging torrent in winter.\n\nThe Vohinas almost certainly gave Poros its name. The word ‘poros’ in Greek means ‘ford’ or ‘crossing’ and where the Vohinas enters the sea is the only natural crossing point, although two bridges now cross the river further upstream where the Vohinas exits the impressive Poros gorge, an 80-metre deep rugged ravine which, until a road was cut through to Skala around 1996, was the only land route out of Poros. Local legend has it that the gorge was ‘cut’ by Heracles when he stood on, and flattened, this part of the mountain.\n\nAnother local legend concerns the large rocks just off the beach between Poros and Skala. Apparently these were thrown at early invaders by the Cyclops. The coastline on the other side of Poros, facing Ithaca, is one of the last refuges of the endangered Mediterranean Monk Seal (Monachus monachus).\n\nJust out of the Poros gorge a rough vehicular track leads to the Atros monastery, the oldest on Cephalonia, with impressive views across Poros. Further along is another track leading to the Mycenaean tomb of Tzanata.\n\nArchaeological finds from the Drakaina cave in the beautiful gorge of Poros, which was excavated in recent years, confirm human habitation in Poros since 5,700 B.C. Interesting finds brought to light - tools made of stone and bone, figurines, pottery - tell us a good deal about the use of the cave in prehistoric and historic times. Finds from the Classical period indicate that the cave was then associated with the cult of the Nymphs. The name Drakena (She-Dragon) refers to the local legend of a dragon that lived in the gorge of Poros. In the popular imagination certain marks in the rocks on the side of the gorge were believed to be the dragon's foot prints. \nThe area around Poros was certainly inhabited during the period when Mycenae was all-powerful, evidenced by the discovery, in 1991, of a tholos (Beehive tomb) in nearby Tzanata. The size of the tomb, the nature of the burial offerings found there and its well chosen position point to the existence of an important Mycenaean town in the vicinity. In the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli one can admire the major findings of the tholos tomb like golden bull horns, a golden double axe and engraved seals of precious stone. \nAlthough other tombs from the Mycenaean period have been found on the island, notably at Mazarakata and Lakithra, the Tzanata tomb is the most impressive yet to be discovered on Cephalonia or Ithaca.\n\nDuring the classical period Poros was probably the port for the city of Pronnoi (above present-day Pastra, administrative centre for the area).\n\nSuccessive occupiers - Romans, Franks, Venetians, Italians, French, Russians, Turks (very briefly) and finally the British (until 1834) - controlled Cephalonia and, under the governorship of Sir Charles Napier, settlers from Malta were re-located into the fertile area around Poros in an attempt to implement a model agricultural settlement and re-populate this part of the island.

Rugendas is considered \"by far the most varied and important of the European artists to visit Latin America.\" He was influenced by Alexander von Humboldt. Rugendas is also the subject of César Aira's 2000 novel, \"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter\".\n\nRugendas was born in Augsburg, then part of the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg in the Holy Roman Empire, now (Germany), into the seventh generation of a family of noted painters and engravers of Augsburg (he was a great grandson of Georg Philipp Rugendas, 1666–1742, a celebrated painter of battles). He first studied drawing and engraving with his father, Johann Lorenz Rugendas II (1775–1826). From 1815-17, he studied with Albrecht Adam (1786–1862), and later in the Academy de Arts of Munich, with Lorenzo Quaglio II (1793–1869). When Rugendas was born, Augsburg was a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire. After the Napoleonic Wars, in 1806 it had the status of a city in the newly created Kingdom of Bavaria.\nInspired by the artistic work of Thomas Ender (1793–1875) and the travel accounts in the tropics by German naturalists Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826) and Carl von Martius (1794–1868), in the course of the Austrian Brazil Expedition, Rugendas Baron von Langsdorff's scientific expedition to Brazil as an illustrator. They reached Brazil in 1822. Langsdorff was the consul-general of the Russian Empire in Brazil and had a farm in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro. Rugendas and other members of the expedition lived on the farm.\n\nAs illustrator, Rugendas visited the Serra da Mantiqueira and the historical towns of Barbacena, São João del Rei, Mariana, Ouro Preto, Caeté, Sabará and Santa Luzia. Just before the fluvial phase of the expedition started (a fateful journey to the Amazon), he became alienated from von Langsdorff and left the expedition. He was replaced by the artists Adrien Taunay and Hércules Florence. But Rugendas continued to live on his own in Brazil until 1825, exploring and recording his many impressions of daily life in the provinces of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. He also visited the coastal provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco on his journey back to Europe. He produced mostly drawings and watercolors.\nOn his return to Europe between 1825 and 1828, Rugendas lived successively in Paris, Augsburg and Munich, with the aim of learning new art techniques, such as oil painting. There, he published from 1827 to 1835, with the help of Victor Aimé Huber, his monumental book \"Voyage Pittoresque dans le Brésil\" (Picturesque Voyage to Brazil), with more than 500 illustrations. It was considered one of the most important documents about Brazil in the 19th century.\nHe spent time studying in Italy. Inspired by explorer and naturalist, Alexander Humboldt (1769–1859), Rugendas sought financial support for a much more ambitious project of recording pictorially the life and nature of Latin America. In his word, it would be \"an endeavor to truly become the illustrator of life in the New World\". In 1831 he traveled first to Haiti, and then to Mexico. In Mexico, he did drawings and watercolors of Morelia, Teotihuacan, Xochimilco, and Cuernavaca. He also began to practice oil painting, with excellent results. After becoming involved in a failed coup in 1834 against Mexico's president, Anastasio Bustamante, Rugendas was incarcerated and expelled from the country.\n\nFrom 1834 to 1844 he travelled to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Bolivia, and finally returned in 1845 to Rio de Janeiro. Well-accepted and feted by the court of Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil, he executed portraits of several members of the royal court and participated in an artistic exposition. At the age of 44, in 1846, Rugendas departed for Europe.\n\nFrom 1822 to 1825, as part of the Langsdorff expedition, Rugendas depicted black people living in Brazil. Along with other ethnographic artists who worked in Brazil, such as Jean-Batiste Debret, and François-August Biard, Rugendas is part of the tropical romanticism. This movement challenged the dichotomy between nature and civilization and considered places such as colonial Brazil to be a harmonious environment of racial mixing.\n\nTropical romanticism was one of the elements that influenced Rugendas's representations of black people. According to Freitas, Rugendas illustrated black people of varied origins. This type of illustration details the physical characteristics of black men and women by focusing on hairstyles, adornments, marks and scars, and types of nose, lips, and eyes, demonstrating the ethnographic purpose of these drawings. In the same lithograph, the artist depicts four or five busts of men and women to compare differences and similarities among nations of origin, but also to identify different degrees of civilization. He identified more savage people by depicting them with skin marks and deformities, and normally without clothes. On the other hand, criollos were represented wearing clothes and jewelry, as if to mark a step forward toward civilization if compared with black Africans. Rugendas celebrated black people born in Brazil, saying they were more polished and benevolent than Africans.\n\nSecondly, Rugendas depicted black people in scenes. These painted images presented activities of urban work, such as street commerce, water transportation, and laundry. The main focus was in the activity and the landscape rather than in detailing variation among blacks of different origins. For this reason, he portrayed a generic type of black in such scenes. Rugendas represented the work performed by black people as a civilizing element that allowed them to develop themselves and to have social mobility. \nInfluenced by Alexander von Humboldt's ideas, Rugendas considered environmental conditions to be determinant factors to human development. He believed that the lack of what he considered formal education and civilizing elements in Africa contributed to the inferiority of the African race. Humboldt was an abolitionist, and Rugendas similarly disapproved of the Brazilian slavery system. He supported a gradual and progressive emancipation. The historian Robert Slenes said that Rugendas;s political agenda that worked together with his ethnographic studies. To Slenes, the artist compromised with a conservative Christian reformism, typical of the abolitionist movement. Although Rugendas defended gradual emancipation, the artist also believed that Brazilian slavery represented a new, positive life for Africans, who got the chance to learn the Christian experience. In some images, for example the \"Enterro de um Negro na Bahia\", Rugendas identified the dead body of a \"black man with another corpse: the suffering Christ the ‘Savior’ honored by the city’s name.\" There are other images where elements of Catholicism are present, such as \"Mercado de Negros\" (a slave market with a church in the background) and \"Familia de Agricultores\", the latter one of the few images in which Rugendas portrays black people in private environments; they are slaves or servants to the white family. \n\nPetrônio Domingues says that the artistic work of foreigner painters and ethnographers in nineteenth-century Brazil had a strong influence on the development of the racial imaginary. The romantic view on slavery in Brazil as a civilizing influence, contributed to creation of the myth of racial democracy. Outside Brazil, the images Rugendas produced had relative success. He published a book with his travel log and a collection of one hundred pictures; it was called \"Viagem Pitoresca através do Brazil\", in Portuguese; \"Voyage Pittoresque dans le Brésil\", in French; and \"Malerische Reise in Brasilien\", in German. During the nineteenth century, there was increased publication of travel books and the development of lithographs to illustrate them. Rugendas’s images helped to spread the idea of racial harmony inside and outside Brazil.\n\nHe died on 29 May 1858 in Weilheim an der Teck, Germany. King Maximilian II of Bavaria had acquired most of his works in exchange for a life pension. His painting \"Columbus Taking Possession of the New World\" (1855) has been on view at the Neue Pinakothek, in Munich.\n\n\n"}

In the serial, three Gods of Ragnarok force visitors of the Psychic Circus to put on acts for their amusement.\n\nThe Seventh Doctor and Ace are invited to the Psychic Circus on the planet Segonax. Aside from others that have been invited, the Circus is surprisingly empty; a few entertainers and stagehands are present alongside the Ringmaster and Morgana, the ticket seller and fortune teller, and the only audience is a stoic family of three: a father, mother and daughter. The Doctor and Ace quickly learn that they are expected to perform for the circus, and those that fail to entertain the family are annihilated. Escape is nearly impossible, as the Chief Clown, aided by numerous kites used for surveillance, leads a group of mechanical clowns around the wastelands of Segonax to recapture those that escape.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace discover the corpse of Flower Child, a worker who had attempted to escape. Ace takes one of her earrings and pins it to her jacket as a keepsake. The Chief Clown later notices this and demands to know where Ace got it, and she flees into the circus, finding the robot mechanic Bellboy hiding there. He recognises Flower Child's earring, but his memories have been disrupted when he was captured, but tells Ace he does remember there being more people at the circus. Ace helps to untie him and they take to hiding in a circus caravan, where Ace tries to help Bellboy recover his memory.\n\nThe Doctor, meanwhile, has joined with intergalactic explorer Captain Cook and his young female companion Mags, who had also been invited to the circus. They all are told that they will be expected to entertain in the near future by the Ringmaster. Mags joins the Doctor as he explores the circus to try to learn what really is going on. They find a well with a glowing energy source at the bottom, with an eye symbol similar to that on the Chief Clown's kites and Morgana's crystal ball. Just then, they are cornered by Cook along with several mechanical clowns, informing the Doctor is on next. The Doctor escapes encountering a worker named Dead Beat who has a medallion with the same eye symbol.\n\nEventually, he comes to the same caravan that Ace and Bellboy are hiding in. Ace has been able to help Bellboy restore his memories. In the past, Dead Beat, then known as Kingpin and owner of the Psychic Circus, had come to Segonax in search of a great power; in finding it, the power had driven him mad and caused him to enslave the rest of the circus to that power. The Chief Clown locates the three in the caravan, and Bellboy, feeling responsible for Flower Child's death as he had been forced to construct the robotic bus conductor, offers to sacrifice himself to let the Doctor and Ace escape.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace locate Dead Beat, and take him to the well. The Doctor recognises Dead Beat's medallion is missing a piece and believes it in the bus, and thus offers to cover for Ace and Dead Beat to look for it, while he takes his role in the ring. At the main tent, Cook says that the Doctor, he, and Mags are up next. Cook asks for a beam of moonlight to aid in his performance, but this instead reveals Mags to be a werewolf. However, instead of attacking the Doctor, the transformed Mags attacks and kills Cook. The family cheers, entertained by the violent display, and the Doctor and Mags are allowed to go. With no other entertainment, the family orders the Ringmaster and Morgana to perform, but they fail to entertain and are also killed.\nAce and Dead Beat recover the medallion piece from the bus, and once attached, Dead Beat recovers his Kingpin personality. Kingpin helps to defeat the Chief Clown and his robots before they return to the circus, only to find the Doctor is again been called to entertain the family. The Doctor has determined that the family are really Gods of Ragnarok, who feed on entertainment and kill those who do not satisfy them. The Doctor instructs Ace and Kingpin to throw his medallion, linked to the dimensional portal that the Gods use, into the energy well while he tries to give them time by performing for them. Ace and Kingpin complete this in time just as the Doctor is about to be obliterated; the medallion falls into the ring, as the well was a dimensional portal to it, and the Doctor uses the medallion to reflect the Gods' powers back onto them. The Doctor leaves the main tent as it explodes.\n\nThe Doctor regroups with Ace, Mags, and Kingpin. Kingpin and Mags decide to reclaim the circus and take it to a new planet to start it anew, and the Doctor and Ace say their goodbyes.\n\nThe character of Whizz Kid was created as a parody of obsessive fans. Sylvester McCoy was coached in the magic tricks he performs in episode 4 by Geoffrey Durham, formerly known as the Great Soprendo.\n\nOwing to the discovery of asbestos at the BBC, which led to the temporary closure of various television studios, this story nearly met the same fate as that of the uncompleted \"Shada\" - that of being cancelled after the location work had been completed. However, a tent was erected in the car park of BBC Elstree Centre, where the crew completed all sequences previously scheduled for the studio.\n\nDirector Alan Wareing provides the voice for the third God of Ragnarok in Part Four. Dean Hollingsworth as the Bus Conductor is credited for Part Three, but does not appear. Jessica Martin who plays Mags in this episode, briefly returns in \"Voyage of the Damned\" (2007) voicing Queen Elizabeth II. Ian Reddington, the Chief Clown, later played Nobody No-One in the audio play \"A Death in the Family\". Harry Peacock, the brother of Daniel Peacock, who plays Nord the Vandal in this serial, later appeared in the 2008 episodes \"Silence in the Library\" and \"Forest of the Dead\" as Proper Dave.\n\nThe last episode of the story received the highest viewing figure of Sylvester McCoy's time in \"Doctor Who\" - 6.6 million against \"Coronation Street\".\n\nReviewing \"The Greatest Show in the Galaxy\", Tat Wood described it as \"a story with so much going \"right\"\" and a sign of how he believed the show had improved since its mid-1980s period. Noting how difficult the story had been to film, he stated \"it was worth it. This is everything \"Doctor Who\" should be.\" In \"The Discontinuity Guide\", Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping said: \"The ideas in this, one of the most iconic stories, are very imaginative and the direction is psychedelic.\"\n\nIn his 2015 book \"Unofficial Doctor Who: The Big Book of Lists\", author Cameron K. McEwan wrote: \"While certainly not underappreciated by Sylvester McCoy fans (all twelve of them), those who are less impressed with the Seventh Doctor's run will find much to enjoy in this four-parter.\" McEwan concluded \"... the highlight is most definitely Ian Reddington's role as Chief Clown. A superb performance and, still to this day, one of Who's finest villains.\"\n\nIn the book \"The Doctors Are In\", Graeme Burk wrote: \"It's delightfully subversive and funny. Like all good satire, there is a variety of interpretations of what the target might be. But it's undergirded by some scary set pieces to make it tense, brilliant direction by Alan Wareing, some thoughtful moments and a stunning performance by Ian Reddington as the Chief Clown. McCoy, guided by Classic Who's last great director, turns in a lovely, nuanced performance.\" Co-author Robert Smith stated \"this might be the ultimate McCoy story\" which \"showcases McCoy's quirky range\".\n\nIn 2017, \"Entertainment Weekly\" chose the robot clowns from the story as among the \"26 Scariest Pop-Culture Clowns\" and described Ian Reddington's performance as \"chilling\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Stephen Wyatt, was published by Target Books in December 1989. An unabridged reading by Sophie Aldred was released on 1 August 2013 by BBC Audiobooks.\n\n\"The Greatest Show in the Galaxy\" was released on VHS in January 2000. The Region 2 DVD release was on 30 July 2012, completing the DVD releases of Seventh Doctor stories. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 113 on 1 May 2013.\n\nMusic from this story by Mark Ayres was released on CD in 1992 by Silva Screen Records.\n\nAn edited suite of music from the story was also released on the series 50th Anniversary album from Silva Screen.\n"}

{"id": "1805271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805271", "title": "Social construction of technology", "text": "Social construction of technology\n\nSocial construction of technology (also referred to as SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and technology studies. Advocates of SCOT—that is, social constructivists—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to technological determinism and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.\n\nSCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the sociology of scientific knowledge, and its subtopics include actor-network theory (a branch of the sociology of science and technology) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian Thomas P. Hughes. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see strong program). Leading adherents of SCOT include Wiebe Bijker and Trevor Pinch.\n\nSCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is \"the best\"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being \"the best\" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded. Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.\n\nSCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.\n\nAt the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the strong programme in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the \"Principle of Symmetry\" as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.\n\nThe \"Principle of Symmetry\" holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same \"kind\" of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (\"a posteriori\" attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology. All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.\n\nThe symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their \"objective truth\", or inherent \"technical superiority\", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its \"advanced technology\" compared to the \"primitiveness\" of the Penny Farthing, but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven Safety Bicycle. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.\n\nA weak reading of the \"Principle of Symmetry\" points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.\n\nA strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.\n\nThe following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).\n\n\"Interpretative flexibility\" means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly aesthetics to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.\n\nThese alternative interpretations generate different \"problems\" to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the \"best\" tradeoff between traction and speed?\n\nThe most basic relevant groups are the \"users\" and the \"producers\" of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. Trevor Pinch has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology. The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.\n\nJust as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.\n\nThe different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the \"Anti-cyclists\" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.\n\nThe first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.\n\nOver time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:\n\n\nClosure is not permanent. New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the \"green\" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)\n\nThe second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.\n\nThis is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book \"The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America\" the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.\n\nIn 1993, Langdon Winner published an influential critique of SCOT entitled \"Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology.\" In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:\nOther critics include Stewart Russell with his letter in the journal \"Social Studies of Science\" titled \"The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is performed in the Korean language and is generally made up of those of Korean descent. Rising to prominence in ancient Korea, Korean theatre remains vibrant today and is now gaining popularity around the world.\n\nKorean theatre before the 20th century was more 'performance' than 'drama'. There was no plot-driven drama, and all the performative presentations, including dance, shaman ritual, and circus were called \"Nolum\" (놀음) or \"Yeonhee\" (연희), which means 'playing'.\nUp till the 19th century, the leading form of Korean public theatre was \"Talchum\" (탈춤) and \"Pansori\" (판소리). Talchum literally means mask-dance. Multiple players wearing masks performed a loosely fixed text through dance, dialogue and song. Since the performers were able to conceal their identities, many of the plays that were played were satires. Pansori is a form of storytelling. There is one central performer who, through dialogue and song goes through a whole story and another performer who adds rhythm and mood to the story by beating on a drum and putting in verbal sounds (‘chuimsae’-추임새). Neither Talchum nor Pansori had a fixed script – they were handed down orally from generation to generation. \nAfter Korea opened its doors to the foreign countries in the late 19th century, the first modern indoor theater, Hyopyul-sa(협률사) was built in 1902, and the ‘new plays’ (신극) started to come through. ‘New plays’ was the term Korean thespians used for the Western drama at that time. The proscenium stage was introduced as well as Shakespeare, and there was a movement among the theatre practitioners to define a line between the traditional Korean theatre and the new wave. Nowadays the traditional forms are continued by the \"living national treasures\"; people who are selected by the government for having exceptional skill in a traditional art and are funded to pass it down. \nContemporary Korean theatre has three main directions. First there are the government funded theatres such as The National Theatre and Seoul Performing Arts Center. The main repertory consists of Korean traditional theatre and classics such as Shakespeare and Chekhov. The second direction happens at Daehakro (대학로), the ‘off-Broadway’ or ‘off-off-Broadway’ of Seoul, Korea. Most of the theatre that takes place in Daehakro is independent and experimental. The last but largest direction is that of the popular theatre. Many corporate companies have built big theatre spaces in Seoul that are mainly used to stage big musicals and translations of Broadway hits. But whereas these three categories can give one an idea about contemporary Korean theatre, one also needs to keep in mind that the three often intermingle, so sometimes you find experimental theatre at a corporate theatre and a Broadway musical on Daehakro. \nKorean theatre has spread across the world and is rising to prominence in other countries such as Australia, U.S.A and England. Oftentimes themes include modernized and revised versions of traditional Korean plays mixed with melodrama.\n\n\n"}

It has usually been applied to socio-economic relations. \n\nThere are Classical versions of the story in both Greek and Latin, as well as several Latin retellings in Mediaeval times. One by Walter of England is in verse and was followed in Renaissance times by a Neo-Latin poem by Hieronymus Osius. In some sources, the frog sees the ox and tries to equal it in size; in others the frog is only told of an enormous beast by another and keeps swelling, asking at intervals, 'Was it as big as this?' \n\nBoth Martial and Horace are among the Latin satiric poets who made use of the fable of the frog and the ox, although they refer to different versions of it. The story related by Phaedrus has a frog motivated by envy of the ox, illustrating the moral that 'the needy man, while affecting to imitate the powerful, comes to ruin'. It is to this that Martial alludes in a short epigram (X.79) about two citizens trying to outdo each other by building in the suburbs. Horace places a different version of the story towards the end of a long conversation on the demented behaviour of mankind (Satires II.3) where Damasippus accuses the poet of trying to keep up with his rich patron Maecenas. His telling follows the Babrius version in which an ox has stepped on a brood of young frogs and the father tries equaling the beast in size when told of it.\n\nThe folly of trying to keep up with the Joneses is the conclusion drawn by La Fontaine's Fables from the Phaedrus version of the tale, applying it to the artistocratic times in which La Fontaine lived (\"The frog that wished to be as big as the ox\", Fables I.3): \n\nTwo similar stories existed in Greek sources but were never adopted in the rest of Europe. There is a quatrain in Babrius concerning an earthworm that envied the length of a snake and burst in two while stretching itself to equal it. This is number 268 in the Perry Index. In the other fable, numbered 371 by Perry, a lizard destroys itself in a similar way. The moral given is that 'This is what happens to someone who competes with his superiors: he destroys himself before he can equal them.'\n\nThe fable was a favourite in England and was put to popular use on 18th century china by the Fenton pottery and in the 19th century by the Wedgwood pottery. This was on its Aesop series of coloured plates, signed by Emile Lessore in the 1860s. Minton's pottery also used the fable on a series of Aesop tiles a little later. In France a biscuit porcelain figure group illustrating the fable was issued by the Haffreingue porcelain factory at Boulogne between 1857–1859. The ox is modeled lying on the ground and looking down at the frog directly in front.\n\nOther uses have been the appearance of the fable on stamps during the centenary of La Fontaine's death in 1995. In France it was on one of a strip of six 2,80 franc stamps, each illustrating a different fable; in Albania the fable appears by itself on the 25 leke stamp and as part of the over-all design of the 60 leke commemorative. \n\nAmong the composers who have set the fable are the following:\n\n\n"}

Its version of the Bugatti arch-shaped radiator that had evolved from the more architectural one of the Bugatti Type 13 Brescia, was to become the one that the marque is most known for though even in the ranks of the various Type 35s there were variations on the theme.\n\nThe Type 35 was phenomenally successful, winning over 1,000 races in its time. It took the Grand Prix World Championship in 1926 after winning 351 races and setting 47 records in the two prior years. At its height, Type 35s averaged 14 race wins per week. Bugatti won the Targa Florio for five consecutive years, from 1925 through 1929, with the Type 35.\n\nThe original model, introduced at the Grand Prix of Lyon on August 3, 1924, used an evolution of the three-valve 2.0 L (1991 cc/121 in³) overhead cam straight-eight engine first seen on the Type 29. Bore was 60 mm and stroke was 88 mm as on many previous Bugatti models. Ninety-six examples were produced.\n\nThis new powerplant featured five main bearings with an unusual ball bearing system. This allowed the engine to rev to 6,000 rpm, and 90 hp (67 kW) was reliably produced. Solid axles with leaf springs were used front and rear, and drum brakes at the back, operated by cables, were specified. Alloy wheels were a novelty, as was the hollow front axle for reduced unsprung weight. A second feature of the Type 35 that was to become a Bugatti trademark was passing the springs through the front axle rather than simply U-bolting them together as was done on their earlier cars.\n\nA rare version was de-bored (to 52 mm) for a total displacement of 1.5 L (1494 cc/91 in³). There are two of these cars in New Zealand.\n\nDimensions:\n\nA less expensive version of the Type 35 appeared in May, 1925. The factory's \"Type 35A\" name was ignored by the public, who nicknamed it \"Tecla\" after a famous maker of imitation jewelry. The Tecla's engine used three plain bearings, smaller valves, and coil ignition like the Type 30. While this decreased maintenance requirements, it also reduced output. One-hundred thirty nine of the Type 35As were sold.\n\nThe Type 35C featured a Roots supercharger, despite Ettore Bugatti's disdain for forced induction. Output was nearly 128 hp (95 kW) with a single Zenith carburettor. Type 35Cs won the French Grand Prix at Saint-Gaudens in 1928, and at Pau in 1930. Fifty examples left the factory.\n\nFor 1926, Bugatti introduced a special model for the Targa Florio race. Called the \"Type 35T\" officially, it soon became known as the \"Targa Florio\". Engine displacement was up to 2.3 L (2262 cc/138 in³) with a longer 100 mm stroke. Grand Prix rule changes limiting capacity to 2.0 L limited the appeal of this model at the time with just thirteen produced. Bugatti is 'world champion of cars builders' this year.\n\nThe final version of the Type 35 series was the Type 35B of 1927. Originally named \"Type 35TC\", it shared the 2.3 L engine of the Type 35T but added a large supercharger like the Type 35C. Output was 138 hp (102 kW), and 45 examples were made. A British racing green Type 35B driven by William Grover-Williams won the 1929 French Grand Prix at Le Mans.\n\nThe Type 35 chassis and body were reused on the Type 37 sports car. Fitted with a new 1.5 L (1496 cc/91 in³) straight-4 engine, 290 Type 37s were built. This engine was an SOHC three-valve design and produced 60 hp (44 kW). The same engine went on to be used in the Type 40.\n\nThe supercharged Type 37A accounted for 67 of the Type 37's production slots. Engine output was up to . It also had larger shrouded brake drums.\n\nThe Type 39 was basically identical to the Type 35C except for its engine. This was modified to be smaller at 1.5 L (1493 cc/91 in³) with a shorter-stroked crankshaft. This brought stroke down from 88 mm to 66 mm, and a mix of regular and ball bearings were used. Ten examples were produced.\n\nAn odd 1.1 L (1092 cc/66 in³) version was also created by reducing the bore of the engine to 51.3 mm.\n\n"}

There is one school in the centre of the village.\n\nThe village dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, the parish church being founded by St Chad. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The Norman parish church of St Michael and All Angels is a grade I listed building. A civil parish was formed in 1 April 2015 from Lilleshall, Donnington and Muxton, though a previous parish also called \"Lilleshall\" existed.\n\nThere is a monument, a cricket club, a tennis club, a church and a primary school clustered around a bracken-covered hill named Lilleshall Hill.\nLilleshall Abbey, some distance to the east of the village, was an Augustinian house, founded in the twelfth century, the ruins of which are protected by English Heritage. After the dissolution of the monasteries the estate was bought by the Wolverhampton wool merchant James Leveson. His family held the site for four generations and, after two owners died without issue, it passed into the hands of the related Leveson-Gower family in the late 17th century.\n\nLilleshall is surrounded by farmland. The village and surrounds were the site of considerable early industrial development from as early as the 16th century, when Walter Leveson (1551-1602) established a bloomery. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries relatively shallow deposits of coal and limestone were mined, with resultant subsidence. The history of the mining of limestone is reflected in the naming of a road called 'Limekiln Lane' in Lilleshall. The former limestone mines are tucked away in treeland at the Newport end of the village, locally known as \"the Slang\", which is effectively several pits now filled with water, popular with local fishermen and unpopular with local parents of young children - the water is deep and the former minepits area quite dark, abandoned and dangerous.\n\nAt a similar time to the mining of limestone an early example of the English canal network was dug, the Donnington Wood Canal and its Lilleshall branch which were connected by an inclined plane, reflected in the naming of a road named The Incline in Lilleshall.\n\nThe Leveson-Gower Dukes of Sutherland became one of the richest families in the United Kingdom partly as a result of this industrial development and in the late nineteenth century built a new residence, Lilleshall Hall which lies at the heart of the estate a mile from the village. The Sutherland estate was sold off between 1915 and 1917 and the hall eventually passed into state ownership as a sporting facility. It is now the Lilleshall Hall National Sports Centre, once the site of the Football Association youth academy, and now the home of British gymnastics and archery. Lilleshall Hall Golf Club is also in the grounds of Lilleshall Hall.\n\nThe Lilleshall Monument is a high obelisk, a local landmark which stands on top of Lilleshall Hill and was erected in honour of the 1st Duke of Sutherland.\n\n"}

It was formed in 1944 for the stated purpose of defending the film industry, and the country as a whole, against what its founders claimed was communist and fascist infiltration.\n\nWhen the organization was formed in 1944, the initial, immediate purpose was to assemble a group of well-known show business figures willing to attest, under oath, before Congress to the supposed presence of Communists in their industry. When the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated the motion picture industry, the vast majority of \"friendly witnesses\" were supplied by the Alliance.\n\nThe Alliance officially disbanded in 1975.\n\nProminent members of the Alliance included Robert Arthur, Martin Berkeley, Ward Bond, Walter Brennan, Roy Brewer, Clarence Brown, Charles Coburn, Gary Cooper, Laraine Day, Cecil B. DeMille, Walt Disney, Irene Dunne, Victor Fleming, John Ford, Clark Gable, Cedric Gibbons, Hedda Hopper, Leo McCarey, James Kevin McGuinness, Adolphe Menjou, Robert Montgomery, George Murphy, Fred Niblo, Dick Powell, Ayn Rand, Ronald Reagan, Ginger Rogers, Morrie Ryskind, Barbara Stanwyck, Norman Taurog, Robert Taylor, King Vidor, John Wayne, Frank Wead and Sam Wood.\n\nShortly after its formation in 1944, the Alliance issued a \"Statement of Principles\":\nWe believe in, and like, the American way of life: the liberty and freedom which generations before us have fought to create and preserve; the freedom to speak, to think, to live, to worship, to work, and to govern ourselves as individuals, as free men; the right to succeed or fail as free men, according to the measure of our ability and our strength.\n\nBelieving in these things, we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of communism, fascism, and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life; groups that have forfeited their right to exist in this country of ours, because they seek to achieve their change by means other than the vested procedure of the ballot and to deny the right of the majority opinion of the people to rule.\n\nIn our special field of motion pictures, we resent the growing impression that this industry is made of, and dominated by, Communists, radicals, and crackpots. We believe that we represent the vast majority of the people who serve this great medium of expression. But unfortunately it has been an unorganized majority. This has been almost inevitable. The very love of freedom, of the rights of the individual, make this great majority reluctant to organize. But now we must, or we shall meanly lose \"the last, best hope on earth.\"\n\nAs Americans, we have no new plan to offer. We want no new plan, we want only to defend against its enemies that which is our priceless heritage; that freedom which has given man, in this country, the fullest life and the richest expression the world has ever known; that system which, in the present emergency, has fathered an effort that, more than any other single factor, will make possible the winning of this war.\n\nAs members of the motion-picture industry, we must face and accept an especial responsibility. Motion pictures are inescapably one of the world's greatest forces for influencing public thought and opinion, both at home and abroad. In this fact lies solemn obligation. We refuse to permit the effort of Communist, Fascist, and other totalitarian-minded groups to pervert this powerful medium into an instrument for the dissemination of un-American ideas and beliefs. We pledge ourselves to fight, with every means at our organized command, any effort of any group or individual, to divert the loyalty of the screen from the free America that give it birth. And to dedicate our work, in the fullest possible measure, to the presentation of the American scene, its standards and its freedoms, its beliefs and its ideals, as we know them and believe in them.\nIn 1947, Ayn Rand wrote a pamphlet for the Alliance, entitled \"Screen Guide for Americans\", based on her personal impressions of the American film industry. It read, in excerpt:\nThe purpose of the Communists in Hollywood is \"not\" the production of political movies openly advocating Communism. Their purpose is \"to corrupt our moral premises by corrupting non-political movies\" — by introducing small, casual bits of propaganda into innocent stories — thus making people absorb the basic principles of Collectivism \"by indirection and implication\".\n\nThe principle of free speech requires that we do not use police force to forbid the Communists the expression of their ideas — which means that we do not pass laws forbidding them to speak. But the principle of free speech does not require that we furnish the Communists with the means to preach their ideas, and does not imply that we owe them jobs and support to advocate our own destruction at our own expense.\nRand cited examples of popular and critically acclaimed films that in her view contained hidden Communist or Collectivist messages that had not been recognized as such, even by conservatives. Examples included \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (because it portrayed businessmen negatively, and suggested that bankers should give veterans collateral-free loans), and \"A Song to Remember\" (because it implied that Chopin sacrificed himself for a patriotic cause rather than devoting himself to his music).\n\n\n"}

It is a multifunction radar, capable of surveillance, tracking and engaging low radar cross section targets. It is a ground surveliance radar and is a great source of surveliance mean operating at frequency around 20ghz.It is mainly used to track enemy's installations.\n\nRajendra is a slewable passive phased array radar used for 3-D target detection, multi target tracking and multiple missile guidance under extreme hostile EW environment. It makes use of a passive phased array to search a volume of space, distinguish between hostile and friendly targets, automatically track up to 64 targets and command one of several launchers to engage up to 4 targets simultaneously. Initially designed as a standalone system, Rajendra is now equipped with the ability to integrate with a network of sensors, including long and medium-range surveillance radars of foreign and domestic origin. \n\nRajendra's multi-element antenna arrangement folds flat when the vehicle is in motion. The Radar consists of a surveillance antenna array with 4000 phase control modules (PCM's) operating in the G/H-Band (4-8 GHz), engagement antenna array with 1000 PCM's operating in the I/J-Band (8-20 GHz), a 16-element IFF array and steering units. A powerful high-end computer computes phases for all the elements of the array. Rajendra controls the beam positioning sequence through beam requests for each track at adaptive data rates and performs multifunctional roles like search –confirm –track -interrogate targets, assign and lock on launchers, and launch/acquire/ track/guide missiles. The RDP supplies track data to remote group control centre. Rajendra features a Dual channel radar receiver and a C band transmitter, although the complete transmitting and receiving features and bands are unknown.\n\nRajendra radar uses phase shifters integrated in large numbers for electronic beam steering. This allows Rajendra radar to simultaneously track multiple aircraft and also guide multiple missiles towards these targets. The phase shifter was designed and developed by Prof Bharati Bhat, a scientist from Centre for Applied Research in Electronics (CARE) of IIT, Delhi, and her team.\n\nThe phased array radar rotates 360 degrees on a rotating turnstile at a moderate speed. This allows it to perform 360 degree surveillance. The phased array itself has 45 degree scan limits to either side, giving a total scan coverage of 90 degrees, if the radar array is static.\n\nDuring Multisensor Tracking a 2-D battery surveillance radar (BSR) with 360 degree coverage and a larger detection range provides track data to the multifunction, slewable, 3-D phased array radar. This is useful when a single battery of the Rajendra is detached from the group to fight alone, and early warning from the 3-D CAR is not available. The 2-D BSR data is then integrated by the Rajendra's radar vehicle. The multisensor direction finder in Rajendra processes the track data from the phased array radar and the BSR to identify the targets reported by both the sensors and maintains a common track database. For those BSR tracks, which are not being reported by Rajendra though under its coverage, target acquisition is initiated with elevation search in the designated direction. The antenna is skewed in the direction of threat to acquire the targets, which are outside the covered air space. The Rajendra's tracking range is 60 km against fighter aircraft flying at medium altitude. \n\nThe major functions of the Rajendra are:\n\n\nBy 2005, Rajendra II had participated in more than 15 flight trials at Balasore missile testing range. The flight trials have been spread over 4 missions in both group and autonomous mode. High altitude engagement, far boundary engagement, crossing and receding target engagement and multiple missions against multiple targets capabilities have been established. Consistency in performance of radar in guiding missiles as close as 15m has been established. During a mission, a Pilot less Target Aircraft (PTA) was neutralized while engaging crossing and receding target.\nIn 2007, the Akash system cleared the Indian Air Force's user trials with the Rajendra tracking and engaging several targets with warhead equipped missiles. Prior to that, the Akash system elements, including the Rajendra underwent mobility trials at Pokhran and the radar successfully demonstrated its perforfmance in an EW environment, and its ECCM features at the IAF Electronic warfare range at Gwalior.\n\nEach Akash battery has a single Rajendra radar which is linked to up to 4 Akash launchers, each with 3 missiles. Each Rajendra radar can guide up to 2 of these missiles against a single target, with 8 missiles in the air at the same time. \n4 Akash batteries make up a group in the Indian Army configuration, with a central 3D CAR radar acting as the early warning sensor for the entire group.\nIn 2007, the Indian Air Force ordered 2 Akash squadrons to begin with. Each squadron consists of a minimum of two batteries, and hence at least 4 Rajendra radars are on order. Many more orders are expected to come over time, as the Indian Air Force phases out its older Pechora systems. The IAF had 30 Pechora squadrons of which 9 were to be replaced by the DRDO-IAI LRSAM project. The rest were to be replaced by the Akash, over time. As of May 2008, the LRSAM project is on hold on account of Indian Government investigations over the earlier Barak SAM deal with the Indian Navy. This is expected to put more emphasis on orders for the Akash SAM, as the Indian Air Force moves towards revamping its SAM inventory.\nThe Rajendra Multi-Function Phased Array radar system, designed at the Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), part of DRDO, is currently in production at Bharat Electronics. It is named after India's First president Dr. Rajendra Prasad.\n\nThe LRDE is working on the Rajendra III radar for the Indian Army. Rajendra III is a slewable phased array radar based on the T-72 chassis built by Ordnance Factories Board's Ordnance Factory Medak. As of 2007, the BLR-III vehicle on T-72 chassis was ready for a track test. The Phased array antenna is fabricated at Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Ghaziabad. Collimated beam pattern and D/S curve for all 16 spot frequencies has been taken.\n\nCurrent orders for the Rajendra and its derivatives are at least 32 units, considering the order for 2 Squadrons of the Akash system by the Indian Air force and the indent for 28 Weapon Locating Radars by the Indian Army.\n\nThe Army intends to use a Rajendra radar derivative in the artillery locating role. During tests at Chandipur for the Akash missile system, engineers noticed the Rajendra radar was able to detect and track artillery shells being test fired at a nearby range. This led to the development of the domestic Weapon Locating Radar, called the Swathi Weapon Locating Radar, an item in high demand by the Indian Army's artillery units, especially after the Kargil War. 28 LRDE Rajendra based WLR's have been ordered by the Indian Army. In June 2008, the WLR was accepted for induction by the Army, and 28 units are being produced by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).\n\n"}

The arboretum of the Barnes Foundation remains in Merion, where it has been proposed to be maintained under a long-term educational affiliation agreement with Saint Joseph's University.\n\nThe Barnes was founded in 1922 by Albert C. Barnes, who made his fortune by co-developing Argyrol, an antiseptic silver compound that was used to combat gonorrhea and inflammations of the eye, ear, nose, and throat. He sold his business, the A.C. Barnes Company, just months before the stock market crash of 1929.\n\nToday, the foundation owns more than 4,000 objects, including over 900 paintings, estimated to be worth about $25 billion. These are primarily works by Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and Modernist masters, but the collection also includes many other paintings by leading European and American artists, as well as African art, antiquities from China, Egypt, and Greece, and Native American art.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Foundation's declining finances led its leaders to various controversial moves, including sending artworks on a world tour and proposing to move the collection to Philadelphia. After numerous court challenges, the new Barnes building opened on Benjamin Franklin Parkway on May 19, 2012. The foundation's current president and executive director, Thomas “Thom” Collins, was appointed on January 7, 2015.\n\nAlbert C. Barnes began collecting art as early as 1902, but became a serious collector in 1912. He was assisted at first by painter William Glackens, an old schoolmate from Central High School in Philadelphia. On an art buying trip to Paris, France, Barnes visited the home of Gertrude and Leo Stein where he purchased his first two paintings by Henri Matisse. In the 1920s, Barnes became acquainted with the work of other modern artists such as Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Giorgio de Chirico through his Paris art dealer Paul Guillaume.\n\nOn December 4, 1922, Barnes received a charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania establishing the Barnes Foundation as an educational institution dedicated to promoting the appreciation of fine art and arboriculture. He purchased property in Merion from the American Civil War veteran and horticulturist Captain Joseph Lapsley Wilson, who had established an arboretum there in around 1880. He commissioned architect Paul Philippe Cret to design a complex of buildings, including a gallery, an administration building, and a service building. The Barnes Foundation officially opened on March 19, 1925.\n\nThe main building features several unusual Cubist bas-reliefs commissioned by Barnes from the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. Elements of African art decorate the exterior wrought iron and the tile work created by the Enfield Pottery and Tile Works on the front portico of the building. Barnes built his home next to the gallery, which now serves as the administration building of the Foundation. His wife, Laura Leggett Barnes, developed the Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation and its horticultural education program in 1940.\n\nIn 1908, Barnes organized his business, the A.C. Barnes Company, as a cooperative, devoting two hours of the work day to seminars for his workers. They read philosophers William James, Georges Santayana, and John Dewey. Barnes also brought some of his art collection into the laboratory for the workers to consider and discuss. This kind of direct experience with art was inspired by the education philosophy of John Dewey and planted the seed that eventually grew into the establishment of the Barnes Foundation. The two met at a Columbia University seminar in 1917 becoming close friends and collaborators spanning more than three decades.\n\nBarnes's conception of his foundation as a school rather than a typical museum was shaped through his collaboration with John Dewey (1859–1952). Like Dewey, Barnes believed that learning should be experiential. The Foundation classes included experiencing original art works, participating in class discussion, reading about philosophy and the traditions of art, as well as looking objectively at the artists' use of light, line, color, and space. Barnes believed that students would not only learn about art from these experiences but that they would also develop their own critical thinking skills enabling them to become more productive members of a democratic society.\n\nThe early education programs at the Barnes Foundation were taught in partnership with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. The courses at Penn were first taught by Laurence Buermeyer (1889–1970), who held a philosophy PhD from Princeton, and later by Thomas Munro (1897–1974), a philosophy professor and one of Dewey's students. Each served as the Associate Director of Education, while Dewey served in the largely honorary position of Director of Education.\n\nAnother collaborator was Violette de Mazia (1896–1988), who was born in Paris and educated in Belgium and England. Originally hired to teach French to the Foundation staff in 1925, de Mazia became a close associate of Barnes, teaching and co-authoring four Foundation publications. After Barnes' death, she became a trustee and the Director of Education of the Art Department, continuing to express Barnes' philosophy in her teaching. The Violette de Mazia Foundation was then established after her death, and in 2011 the Barnes Foundation came to an agreement with them to allow the de Mazia Foundation student access to the collection for art education after its move to the Parkway. In 2015 however, the de Mazia Foundation ceased its operations and was absorbed by the Barnes Foundation.\n\nBarnes created detailed terms of operation in an indenture of trust to be honored in perpetuity after his death. These included limiting public admission to two days a week, so the school could use the art collection primarily for student study, and prohibiting the loan of works in the collection, colored reproductions of its works, touring the collection, and presenting touring exhibitions of other art. Matisse is said to have hailed the school as the only sane place in America to view art.\n\nAfter a decade of legal challenges, the public was allowed regular access to the collection in 1961. Public access was expanded to two and a half days a week, with a limit of 500 visitors per week; reservations were required by telephone at least two weeks in advance. Harold J. Weigand, an editor of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", with the consent of, but not directly on behalf of, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, had filed an earlier suit for access but been unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1992, Richard H. Glanton, president of the foundation, said the museum needed extensive repairs to upgrade its mechanical systems, provide for maintenance and preservation of artworks, and improve security. The old Philadelphia firm J.S. Cornell & Son was the contractor of choice. In order to raise the money, Glanton decided to break some terms of the indenture. From 1993 to 1995, 83 of the collection's Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings were sent on a world tour, attracting large crowds in numerous cities, including Washington, D.C.; Fort Worth, Texas; Paris; Tokyo; Toronto; and Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe revenue earned from the tour of paintings was still not enough to ensure its endowment. By fall 1998, Glanton and fellow board member Niara Sudarkasa were suing each other. Lincoln University, which according to the Barnes Foundation's indenture, controlled four of the five seats on the board of trustees, began an investigation into the Foundation's finances. The Foundation's board believed that a similar investigation was warranted for activities during Glanton's tenure as president. In 1998 the board of directors began a forensic audit conducted by Deloitte, which was kept private for three years, eventually released, and criticized Glanton's expenses and management.\n\nIn 1998, Kimberly Camp was hired as the foundation's CEO and first arts professional to run the Barnes. During her seven-year tenure, she turned the struggling foundation around and provided necessary support to the petition to move the Barnes to Philadelphia.\n\nOn September 24, 2002, the foundation announced that it would petition the Montgomery County Orphans' Court (which oversees its operations) to allow the art collection to be moved to Philadelphia (which offered a site on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway) and to triple the number of trustees to 15. The foundation's indenture of trust stipulates that the paintings in the collection be kept \"in exactly the places they are\".\n\nThe foundation argued that it needed to expand the board of trustees from five (four of which were held by persons appointed by Lincoln University) to 15 to increase fundraising. For the same reason, it needed to move the gallery from Merion to a site in Center City, Philadelphia, which would provide greater public access. In its brief to the court, the foundation said that donors were reluctant to commit continuing financial resources to the Barnes unless the gallery were to become more accessible to the public.\n\nOn December 15, 2004, after a two-year legal battle that included an examination of the foundation's financial situation, Judge Stanley Ott ruled that the foundation could move. Three charitable foundations, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Lenfest Foundation and the Annenberg Foundation, had agreed to help the Barnes raise $150 million for a new building and endowment on the condition that the move be approved.\n\nOn June 13, 2005, the Foundation's president, Kimberly Camp, announced her resignation, to take effect no later than January 1, 2006. Camp had been appointed in 1998 with the goal of stabilizing and restoring the foundation to its original mission. During her tenure, she began the Collection Assessment Project, the first full-scale effort to catalog and stabilize the artworks; brought in exemplary professional staff; created the fundraising program; restored Ker-feal and the Barnes Arboretum; and worked with the board to approve policies and procedures to make the foundation viable. In 2002, Dr. Bernard C. Watson began the proposal to move the Barnes.\n\nThe foundation pledged to reproduce Barnes's artistic arrangement of the artworks and other furniture within the new gallery to maintain the experience as he intended.\n\nIn August 2006, the Barnes Foundation announced that it was beginning a planning analysis for the new gallery. The board selected Derek Gillman (formerly of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts) as the new director and president. In June 2011, the foundation announced that it had surpassed its $200 million fund-raising goal, of which $150 million would go toward construction of the Philadelphia building and associated costs, and $50 million to the foundation's endowment.\n\nThe foundation proceeded with plans to build a new facility in the 2000 block of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, near the Rodin Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Tod Williams & Billie Tsien Architects of New York were lead architects of the building project. The building team also consisted of the Philadelphia-based firm, Ballinger, as associate architect; OLIN as landscape architect; and Fisher Marantz Stone as lighting designers. Aegis Property Group served as external project managers, with L. F. Driscoll as construction managers. Project executive Bill McDowell supervised and coordinated the project for the foundation.\n\nConstruction for the new building began in fall, 2009 and the building opened in May, 2012. The new galleries were designed to replicate the scale, proportion and configuration of the original galleries in Merion. Reviews have praised the new facility, claiming the additional natural light has improved the viewing experience. The new site contains more space for the foundation's art education program and conservation department, a retail shop, and cafe.\n\nAfter Judge Ott's decision in 2004, The Friends of the Barnes Foundation and Montgomery County filed briefs in Montgomery County Orphan's Court to reopen the hearings that allowed the move. They hoped to persuade Ott to reopen the case because of the changed circumstances in the County. On May 15, 2008, Ott published an opinion dismissing the request of both the Friends of the Barnes Foundation and the Montgomery County Commissioners to reopen the case due to lack of standing. Congressman Jim Gerlach strongly supported keeping the Barnes in Merion.\n\nOn May 20, 2009, Friends of the Barnes Foundation appeared before the Commissioners of the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) in Camden, New Jersey, to request that they reconsider their 2003 authorization of a grant of $500,000 toward the plan to move the foundation. They contended there was insufficient evidence of substantial economic benefit to Philadelphia, and that DRPA had not undertaken necessary economic evaluation assessing the impact at both locations. They introduced a study by economist Matityahu Marcus that challenged the claimed benefits. The DRPA said that it would consider the Friends' request but did not change its decision. The history is chronicled in the HBO documentary The Collector.\n\nIn late February 2011, The Friends of the Barnes Foundation filed a petition to reopen the case. A new hearing, set for March 18, was postponed until August 3, 2011. The court ordered the foundation and the Attorney General's office, who argued in favor of the move, to explain why the case should not be reopened. The opposition group, Friends of the Barnes Foundation, says \"The Art of the Steal\" revealed that Ott did not have all the evidence in 2006, when he approved the art collection's move. On October 6, 2011, Judge Ott ruled that the Friends of the Barnes Foundation had no legal standing and that there was no new information in the movie.\n\nAfter the move, the Barnes Foundation retained its ownership of the building in Merion, using it as a storage space. In 2018, Saint Joseph's University took a 30-year lease on the building and its adjoining arboretum at a cost of $100 a year, with Saint Joseph's University undertaking to pay the maintenance and security costs for the property. The lease allows the university to hang its own artworks in the gallery space.\n\nThe collection includes:\nOther European and American masters in the collection include Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, Paul Gauguin, El Greco, Francisco Goya, Édouard Manet, Jean Hugo, Claude Monet, Maurice Utrillo, William Glackens, Charles Demuth, Horace Pippin, Jules Pascin and Maurice Prendergast. It also holds a variety of African artworks; ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art; Native American works, American and European furniture, decorative arts and metalwork. The museum also holds several significant works by cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.\n\nThe collection displays different types of artworks according to Barnes' methodology in \"wall ensembles\", often alongside hand-wrought iron, antique furniture, jewelry and sculpture, which allow comparison and study of works from various time periods, geographic areas, and styles.\n\nAfter Barnes met Matisse in the United States, he commissioned \"The Dance II\", a 45-by-15-foot triptych that was placed above Palladian windows in the main gallery space.\n\nThe original Barnes Foundation campus in Merion, Pennsylvania, is now a 12-acre arboretum open to the public for tours. The plant collection features favorite plants assembled by Mrs. Barnes for teaching purposes, and includes stewartia, aesculus, phellodendron, clethra, magnolia, viburnums, lilacs, roses, peonies, hostas, medicinal plants, and hardy ferns. A herbarium and horticulture library is available to the Foundation's horticulture students and other scholars by appointment. Classes are offered in horticulture topics for the general public.\n\n\n"}

Unlike the G7, where the common denominator is the economy and long-term political motives, the G4's primary aim is the permanent member seats on the Security Council. Each of these four countries have figured among the elected non-permanent members of the council since the UN's establishment. Their economic and political influence has grown significantly in the last decades, reaching a scope comparable to the permanent members (P5). However, the G4's bids are often opposed by the Uniting for Consensus movement, and particularly their economic competitors or political rivals.\n\nThe UN currently has five permanent members with veto power in the Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States- comprising the victors of World War II. The G4 nations are regularly elected to two-year terms on the Security Council as non-permanent members by their respective regional groups: in the 24-year period from 1987 to 2010, Brazil and Japan were elected for five terms each, Germany for four terms (one term as West Germany and three terms as unified Germany) and India for four terms. Cumulatively, the G4 has spent 64 years on the Security Council since the UN's inception, with each country serving at least a decade. By comparison, the three permanent members of the Security Council who have maintained their seats since the UN's founding (France, the UK, and the US) have each accrued years of membership. The People's Republic of China has held its permanent seat for years, since it replaced the Republic of China in 1971, and Russia has held its permanent seat for years, since it replaced the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe United Kingdom and France have backed the G4's bid for permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Japan has received support from the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nAll the permanent members of P5 have supported India's bids for permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) but China had previously implied that it is only ready to support India's bid for a permanent seat on United Nations Security Council if India did not associate its bid with Japan.\n\nThe United States has sent strong indications to Brazil that it was willing to support its membership; albeit, without a veto. The Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the U.S. government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. Brazil has received backing from three of the current permanent members, namely France, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the final document of the 2019 BRICS summit, China and Russia say they \"reiterate the importance of a comprehensive Security Council reform\" and \"support Brazil and India's aspiration for more relevant UN roles\".\n\nAs stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi in January 2020: \"I would say the Security Council's main shortcoming is the under-representation of developing countries. We reiterate our position that India and Brazil absolutely deserve to be on the council together with an African candidate, our position is that the purpose of the reform is to make sure that the developing countries enjoy a better treatment in the central organ of the United Nations\".\n\nThere has been discontent among the present permanent members regarding the inclusion of controversial nations or countries not supported by them. For instance, Japan's bid is heavily opposed by China, North Korea, Russia and South Korea who think that Japan still needs to make additional atonement for war crimes committed during World War II.\n\nUnder the leadership of Italy, countries that strongly oppose the G4 countries' bids have formed the Uniting for Consensus movement, or the \"Coffee Club\", composed mainly of regional powers that oppose the rise of some nearby country to permanent member status. India is currently not opposed by any P5 nation.\nIn Europe, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Spain, oppose a seat for Germany. In Africa, Namibia also opposes Germany's bid. In Latin America, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela are opposing a seat for Brazil. In South Asia, Pakistan opposes India's bid.\n\nThe G4 suggested that two African nations, in addition to themselves, be included in the enlarged UNSC. In several conferences during the summer of 2005, African Union was unable to agree on two nominees: Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa all lay claim to a permanent African UNSC seat.\n\nA UN General Assembly in September 2005 marked the 60th anniversary of the UN and the members were to decide on a number of necessary reforms—including the enlarged Security Council. However the unwillingness to find a negotiable position stopped even the most urgent reforms; the September 2005 General Assembly was a setback for the UN.\n\nThe G4 retain their goal of permanent UNSC membership for all four nations (plus two African nations). In January 2006, Japan announced it would not support putting the G4 resolution back on the table, not to interfere with any effort by the African Union to unite behind a single plan. And meanwhile, Japan's continuing relations with the G4 were not mutually exclusive. G4 issued a joint statement on 12 February 2011, in which their foreign ministers agreed to seek concrete outcome in the current session of the UN General Assembly.\n\nOn September 2015, Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of India invited the leaders of the G4 for a summit following the adoption of UN General Assembly Decision 69/560 by consensus, which moved forward for the first time. In 2017, it was reported that the G4 nations were willing to temporarily forgo veto power if granted a permanent UNSC seat.\n\nOn September 2019 in a joint press statement, during the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the G4 ministers reiterated their strong commitment to an early and comprehensive reform of the UNSC. Bearing in mind that in 2020 the United Nations will celebrate its 75th anniversary, the G4 ministers also expressed their firm hope that the current session of the General Assembly will pave the way for finally moving on the call for an ‘early reform’ of the Security Council and underscored their steadfast support for Africa’s representation in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of a future reform.\n\n"}

{"id": "1805371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805371", "title": "National Day of Prayer", "text": "National Day of Prayer\n\nThe National Day of Prayer is an annual day of observance held on the first Thursday of May, designated by the United States Congress, when people are asked \"to turn to God in prayer and meditation\". The president is required by law () to sign a proclamation each year, encouraging all Americans to pray on this day.\n\nThe modern law formalizing its annual observance was enacted in 1952, although earlier days of fasting and prayer had been established by the Second Continental Congress from 1775 until 1783, and by President John Adams in 1798 and 1799. Thomas Jefferson established a day of prayer and thanksgiving, but this occurred while he served as governor of Virginia.\n\nThe constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer was unsuccessfully challenged in court by the Freedom From Religion Foundation after their first attempt was unanimously dismissed by a federal appellate court in April 2011.\n\nThe National Day of Prayer shares common roots with the celebration of Thanksgiving; both were national proclamations establishing a day of prayer. In the New England Colonies under British rule, traditional observances in late fall called for prayer and thanksgiving, while observances in the spring or summer called for prayer and fasting. The fall observance was established by President Abraham Lincoln as the official Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. The spring observance was established by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 as the National Day of Prayer.\n\nFriction in 1768–1776 between the American colonists and England spurred some American cities and colonies to proclaim days of prayer. For instance, Boston declared a day of fasting and prayer in September 1768, as a protest against a British plan to station troops in the city. The Colony of Virginia's House of Burgesses established a day of fasting and prayer to take place on Wednesday, June 1, 1774, to protest the Boston Port Act, such that the people of Virginia would assemble for prayer led by clergymen. Thomas Jefferson wrote that \"the effect of the day through the whole colony was like a shock of electricity\", moving the Virginians to choose delegates to establish self-rule. The Provinces of South Carolina, Maryland and Georgia all observed official days of fasting and prayer during 1774–1775.\n\nThe observance of a day of fasting and prayer was brought to all of the colonists by the Continental Congress in 1775. Congress issued a proclamation recommending \"a day of publick humiliation, fasting, and prayer\" be observed by the \"English Colonies\" on Thursday, July 20, 1775, \"and to bless our rightful sovereign, King George the Third...\" The text, written by John Witherspoon and John Hancock, instructed the colonists to pray for a resumption of \"the just rights and privileges of the Colonies\" in \"civil and religious\" matters. A proclamation to this end was sent to every town in the colonies. John Adams wrote that the popular response was gratifying, that the special day was more widely observed than the practice of going to church on Sunday. After this success, Congress determined to call for a day of fasting and prayer each spring, and a day of thanksgiving and praise each fall.\n\nIn his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, General George Washington acknowledged a day of \"fasting, humiliation and prayer\" proclaimed by the Continental Congress to be held on Thursday, May 6, 1779. To enable his soldiers to observe the day, Washington ordered a one-day cessation of recreation and \"unnecessary labor\". In March 1780, Congress announced a day of \"fasting, humiliation and prayer\" to be held on Wednesday, April 26, 1780.\n\nThe practice of calling for national days of fasting and prayer was abandoned from 1784 until 1789, even though thanksgiving days were observed each fall. On October 3, 1789, President Washington called for a national day of prayer and thanksgiving to be observed on Thursday, November 26, 1789; this was an extension of the tradition of thanksgiving which was already customary in New England. President Adams continued the practice of proclaiming national days of prayer in the spring and fall, but President Jefferson did not, as he considered prayer to be a matter for personal rather than state involvement. \n\nAfter James Madison, none of the next eleven presidents issued prayer proclamations. Thus, there was a period of 47 years, from 1815 to 1862, with no presidential prayer proclamations.\n\nIn January–February 1952 during the Korean War, the desirability of a united national prayer was stated by Reverend Billy Graham, who said, \"What a thrilling, glorious thing it would be to see the leaders of our country today kneeling before Almighty God in prayer. What a thrill would sweep this country. What renewed hope and courage would grip the Americans at this hour of peril.\" Representative Percy Priest from Tennessee observed that Graham had issued a challenge for a national day of prayer. Members of the House and Senate introduced a joint resolution for an annual National Day of Prayer, \"on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals.\" On April 17, 1952, President Harry S. Truman signed a bill proclaiming a National Day of Prayer must be declared by each subsequent president at an appropriate date of his choice.\n\nIn 1982 a conservative evangelical Christian organization called the \"National Prayer Committee\" was formed to coordinate and implement a fixed annual day of prayer for the purpose of organizing evangelical Christian prayer events with local, state, and federal government entities. The Thanks-Giving Foundation also collaborated in this effort. In his 1983 declaration, Ronald Reagan said, \"From General Washington's struggle at Valley Forge to the present, this Nation has fervently sought and received divine guidance as it pursued the course of history. This occasion provides our Nation with an opportunity to further recognize the source of our blessings, and to seek His help for the challenges we face today and in the future.\"\nIn 1988, the law was amended so that the National Day of Prayer would be held on the first Thursday of May. Two stated intentions of the National Day of Prayer were that it would be a day when adherents of all great religions could unite in prayer and that it may one day bring renewed respect for God to all the peoples of the world.\n\nRepublican Ronald Reagan administration and George H. W. Bush administration (1981–1993) each hosted special National Day of Prayer events held at the White House only once during their administrations. Democrat Bill Clinton administration (1993–2001) did not hold any such events during his time in office, though he issued proclamations annually. \n\nRepublican George W. Bush administration (2001–2009) made his first presidential act be the announcement of a National Day of Prayer, and he held events at the White House in each year of his presidency.\n\nDemocrat Barack Obama (2009–2017) did not hold any public events at the White House, though he issued presidential proclamations regularly each year. \n\nRepublican President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump attended church services in observation of a special National Day of Prayer, which Trump previously declared, in support of the victims of Hurricane Harvey dwelling in the state of Texas, to \"uplift one another and assist those suffering from the consequences of this terrible storm.\"\n\nOn May 7, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many virtual prayer events were planned. President Trump issued an official proclamation. A national event was planned for the evening, to be co-hosted by the grandson of evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nThe National Day of Prayer is celebrated by Americans of many religions, including Christians of many denominations, including Protestants and Catholics, as well as Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus, and Jews, reflecting the demographics of the United States. On the National Day of Prayer, many Americans assemble in prayer in front of courthouses, as well as in houses of worship, such as churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples. Luncheons, picnics, and music performances revolving around praying for the nation are also popular observances. Traditionally, the President of the United States issues an official National Day of Prayer proclamation each year as well.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) sued to challenge the designation of a National Day of Prayer. On October 3, 2008, the Wisconsin-based organization filed suit in the federal district court for western Wisconsin in Madison, naming as defendants President George W. Bush; White House press secretary Dana Perino; Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle; and evangelist James Dobson's wife, Shirley Dobson, in her capacity as chair of the National Day of Prayer Task Force. The Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) provided defense for Shirley Dobson while government lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb to dismiss the case, arguing principally that the group has no legal standing to sue.\n\nOn March 1, 2010 U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb stated that FFRF's lawsuit could proceed because the plaintiffs had shown that they suffered \"concrete injury\" that can potentially be remedied by judicial action. Judge Crabb stated about those supporting the federal law designating the National Day of Prayer, \"adopting [the] defendants' view of standing would allow the government to have unrestrained authority to demean members of any religious group without legal consequence. The federal government could declare the 'National Day of Anti-Semitism' or even declare Christianity the official religion of the United States, but no one would have standing to sue because no one would have to 'pass by' those declarations.\" On April 15, 2010, Judge Crabb ruled that the statute establishing the National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional as it is \"an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function.\" However, Crabb stayed her ruling pending the completion of appeals.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a notice to appeal the ruling on April 22, 2010, and on April 14, 2011 a three judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Crabb's decision. The panel ruled that FFRF did not have standing to sue because the National Day of Prayer had not caused them harm and stated that \"a feeling of alienation cannot suffice as injury.\" The court further stated that \"the President is free to make appeals to the public based on many kinds of grounds, including political and religious, and that such requests do not obligate citizens to comply and do not encroach on citizens' rights.\" The federal appeals court also cited Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address, which referenced God seven times and prayer three times.\n\n\n"}

During the Rwandan genocide he undertook many missions on his own initiative to save the lives of civilians.\n\nDiagne was born in Senegal. After graduating from the University of Dakar he enrolled in the Senegalese Army's École Nationale des Officiers d'Active. He completed his schooling the following year and eventually attained the rank of Captain. He was given command of the 3rd Company of the 6th Infantry Battalion and fought in the Casamance conflict from 1989 to 1993.\n\nThat year Diagne was sent to Rwanda as part of an Organisation of African Unity military observer team tasked with monitoring the Rwandan Civil War, a conflict fought between the Hutu-dominated government and the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). Later he was assigned to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a UN peacekeeping force meant to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords—a peace agreement designed to end the war. In April 1994 the President of Rwanda was killed. Hutu extremists initiated the Rwandan genocide, targeting members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. They murdered moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and Diagne rescued her children and secured them safe passage out of the country. He then undertook numerous missions on his own around Kigali in violation of the UN's rules of engagement, hiding Tutsis in his car and evacuating them to UN installations. He also protected some Hutus and worked to safeguard the Senegalese expatriate community. Various estimates exist for the number of lives Diagne saved, ranging as high as over 1,000.\n\nOn 31 May 1994 Diagne was killed when a mortar shell launched by RPF forces exploded near his car while he was stopped at a government checkpoint. His death led the UN to suspend relief operations in Kigali. His body was repatriated to Senegal and buried with full military honours. In 2005 Diagne was posthumously awarded the rank of Knight in Senegal's National Order of the Lion. The UN Security Council created the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage in 2014 in his honour.\n\nMbaye Diagne was born on 18 March 1958 in Koki, Louga region, Senegal. His first language was Wolof, but he learned to speak others, including English and French. He grew up in Pikine, a suburb of Dakar. Diagne was one of nine children, and the first person in his family to attend university, studying at the University of Dakar. He married a woman named Yacine Mar Diop and had a son, Cheikh, and a daughter, Coumba, with her.\n\nIn January 1983 Diagne enrolled in the École Nationale des Officiers d'Active (National School for Active Officers). He graduated in July 1984 and was made head of section of the 12th Training Battalion of the Senegalese Army. In 1985 he was made promotion \"encadreur\" (organiser) at the Ecole Nationale des Sous-Officiers d'Active (National School of Active Non-Commissioned Officers). He eventually attained the rank of Captain. In 1989 Diagne was given command of the 3rd Company of the Confederal Battalion, later the 6th Infantry Battalion, in Bignona. From there he fought in the Casamance conflict until 1993.\n\nIn 1993 Diagne was sent to Rwanda as a military observer attached to an Organisation of African Unity team meant to monitor the Rwandan Civil War, a conflict fought between the Hutu-dominated government of Rwanda and the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). Later that year the United Nations created Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a UN peacekeeping force meant to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords—a peace agreement designed to end the war. Diagne was then reassigned to UNAMIR and served officially as a military liaison officer between UNAMIR and the Rwandan government. On 6 April 1994 the plane carrying the President of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, was shot down. Soon thereafter the civil war resumed while Hutu extremists moved to seize power and began the Rwandan genocide, targeting members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. The Interahamwe, a Hutu extremest militia, erected roadblocks across the Rwandan capital, Kigali, to screen for Tutsis. The following morning Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu who preferred to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the Tutsis, was assassinated by soldiers of the Presidential Guard at her home in Kigali. The ten Belgian peacekeepers assigned to her protection were also murdered. Diagne heard rumours of Uwilingiyimana's murder from people fleeing to Hôtel des Mille Collines, which was occupied by UN peacekeepers. He came to investigate and found the prime minister's four children being hidden in the adjoining United Nations Development Programme housing compound. Later that morning UNAMIR Force Commander General Roméo Dallaire—also investigating Uwilingiyimana's whereabouts—drove down to the compound and encountered Diagne behind the gates. The captain informed him of the prime minister's murder and expressed concern that the Presidential Guard would return and kill the children. Before departing, Dallaire assured Diagne that UNAMIR armoured personnel carriers would arrive later that day to rescue the children and UNDP employees. Diagne chose to wait with the children, but the armoured vehicles never appeared. Diagne then put the children in the back seat of his own vehicle, covered them with clothes, and brought them to the hotel. From there he smuggled the children past numerous Interahamwe checkpoints and brought them to Kigali International Airport where he secured them safe passage on a Canadian plane to Kenya.\nDespite UN rules prohibiting personnel from intervening in the conflict, it soon became apparent to other UNAMIR personnel that Diagne was ignoring orders and carrying out rescue missions. He would go out alone in his vehicle to rescue Tutsis and bring them to safety before they could be hunted down and killed. He also recovered some Hutus. Because he had to pass through dozens of checkpoints manned by Interahamwe tasked with killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus, Diagne ferried at most five people on each trip, often taking them to the Hôtel des Mille Collines or Amahoro Stadium, both under UN guard, for safety. In order to get past the checkpoints, he relied on his extensive contacts among the military and militias, his ability to defuse tense situations with quick jokes, and occasional bribes of cigarettes, money and—though he was a devout Muslim—alcohol. He paid off militiamen to facilitate the escape of Rwandan employees of UN aid projects. He once spent a full day ferrying 25 Tutsis in his car from a house in Nyamirambo next to a government military base past checkpoints to a safer location. He also acted to protect the Senegalese expatriate community in the country. In one instance he stood between an armed Hutu priest and a woman the priest was about to execute, shouting \"Why are you killing this woman? You must not do this because if you do the whole world will know,\" and eventually convincing the priest to let her live.\n\nDallaire was aware of Diagne's actions but did not attempt to stop him. Gregory Alex, the head of the UN Humanitarian Assistance Team in Rwanda gave an explanation as to why Diagne was not rebuked: \"Here's someone who stepped out of line and [the general is] not going to discipline him because he's doing the right thing.\" BBC journalist Mark Doyle befriended Diagne and knew of his actions, but omitted mention of him in his news dispatches because he feared that the Rwandan government would learn of his rescues and try to stop him. In one instance Doyle was riding in Diagne's car when the two were stopped by a Hutu militia. The militiamen questioned whether Doyle was Belgian, since they were suspicious of Belgians. Diagne diffused the situation by joking that he was a \"black Belgian\" before commanding the militia to let them pass.\nUNAMIR eventually managed to negotiate an agreement with the Rwandan government, whereby they would facilitate the transfer of endangered Hutus behind rebel lines to the government in exchange for being allowed to evacuate endangered Tutsis from government territory to the rebel-held areas. During the first such transfer, a UN convoy laden with Tutsis leaving the Hôtel des Mille Collines was attacked by a militia armed with machetes. Unarmed, Diagne stood atop one of the lorries, striking militiamen with his gear bag and kicking them to protect the civilians. The convoy later returned to the hotel. Diagne also captured amateur video footage of the UN peacekeepers in Rwanda during the genocide, which became one of the few video records of the event.\n\nVarious estimates exist for the number of lives Daigne saved. Dallaire credited him with protecting \"dozens upon dozens\", while Alex stated that he saved \"at least hundreds\". Babacar Faye, a Senegalese soldier who served in UNAMIR, asserted that Diagne saved at least 400 or 500 people. The United States Department of State estimated that he protected as many as 600 people. Academic Richard Siegler posited that he may have saved 1,000 or more lives.\n\nOn 31 May, just 12 days before he was scheduled to go back to Senegal, Diagne drove alone back to UNAMIR Force Headquarters in Kigali with a message for Dallaire from Rwandan Armed Forces Chief of Staff Augustin Bizimungu. While Mbaye was stopped at a Rwandan Armed Forces checkpoint at a bridge along the Boulevard du MRND, RPF forces fired a mortar at the position. Shrapnel entered through the rear window of Diagne's jeep and hit him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Alex realised that the UN did not have a body bag for Diagne and was forced to make one from a light blue UNICEF tarp and tape:\nWe're calling around for a body bag, and there's no body bags, there's nothing, and you wonder...and as we were starting to put this together, we were saying - here's a guy who gave his ultimate—who did everything—and we don't even have a body bag; nothing to, you know, show him some respect. We had some UNICEF plastic sheeting and we had some tape. We're folding them up, and the creases aren't right, because his feet are so damn big. And you don't want that for him; you want it to be like, you know, just laid out perfectly. So that when people look at him, they know that he was something great.\n\nPersonnel at the UNAMIR Force Headquarters held a minute of silence in Diagne's honour and hosted a small parade at the airport on 1 June. Diagne was the 12th UNAMIR peacekeeper to die in the conflict, and his death led the UN to suspend relief operations in Kigali. After five days, Diagne's body was repatriated to Senegal. He was buried there with full military honours.\n\nOn 1 June 2005 Diagne was posthumously awarded the rank of Knight in Senegal's National Order of the Lion. On 4 July 2010 President of Rwanda Paul Kagame accorded Diagne with the Umurinzi honour—Rwanda's Campaign Against Genocide Medal. The following year the United States Department of State accorded him a Tribute To Persons Of Courage certificate. His actions during the genocide were featured in a 2004 \"Frontline\" documentary about the event, \"Ghosts of Rwanda\". On 8 May 2014, the UN Security Council created the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage in honour of the actions of Diagne during the Rwandan Genocide. His family was given the award in May 2016. An Italian veteran of UNAMIR created an association to \"promote Diagne’s memory and support his family’s development.\" On 31 May 2019 the Senegalese Army renamed its training centre in Thiès after Diagne.\n\n"}

When the device has multiple interrupt outputs to assert, it asserts them in the order of their relative priority. Common modes of a PIC include hard priorities, rotating priorities, and cascading priorities. PICs often allow the cascading of their outputs to inputs between each other.\n\nPICs typically have a common set of registers: Interrupt Request Register (IRR), In-Service Register (ISR), Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). The IRR specifies which interrupts are pending acknowledgement, and is typically a symbolic register which can not be directly accessed. The ISR register specifies which interrupts have been acknowledged, but are still waiting for an End Of Interrupt (EOI). The IMR specifies which interrupts are to be ignored and not acknowledged. A simple register schema such as this allows up to two distinct interrupt requests to be outstanding at one time, one waiting for acknowledgement, and one waiting for EOI.\n\nThere are a number of common priority schemas in PICs including hard priorities, specific priorities, and rotating priorities.\n\nInterrupts may be either edge triggered or level triggered.\n\nThere are a number of common ways of acknowledging an interrupt has completed when an EOI is issued. These include specifying which interrupt completed, using an implied interrupt which has completed (usually the highest priority pending in the ISR), and treating interrupt acknowledgement as the EOI.\n\nOne of the best known PICs, the 8259A, was included in the x86 PC. In modern times, this is not included as a separate chip in an x86 PC, but rather as part of the motherboard's southbridge chipset. In other cases, it has been replaced by the newer Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers which support more interrupt outputs and more flexible priority schemas.\n\n\nMore information on the Intel APIC can be found in the \"IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1, Chapter 10\", freely available on the Intel website.\n\n"}

The phrase is derived from analogies to brittleness in metalworking.\n\nWhen software is new, it is very malleable; it can be formed to be whatever is wanted by the implementers. But as the software in a given project grows larger and larger, and develops a larger base of users with long experience with the software, it becomes less and less malleable. Like a metal that has been work-hardened, the software becomes a legacy system, brittle and unable to be easily maintained without fracturing the entire system.\n\nBrittleness in software can be caused by algorithms that do not work well for the full range of input data. A good example is an algorithm that allows a divide by zero to occur, or a curve-fitting equation that is used to extrapolate beyond the data that it was fitted to. Another cause of brittleness is the use of data structures that restrict values. This was commonly seen in the late 1990s as people realized that their software only had room for a 2 digit year entry; this led to the sudden updating of tremendous quantities of brittle software before the year 2000. Another more commonly encountered form of brittleness is in graphical user interfaces that make invalid assumptions. For example, a user may be running on a low resolution display, and the software will open a window too large to fit the display. Another common problem is expressed when a user uses a color scheme other than the default, causing text to be rendered in the same color as the background, or a user uses a font other than the default, which won't fit in the allowed space and cuts off instructions and labels.\n\nVery often, an old code base is simply abandoned and a brand-new system (which is intended to be free of many of the burdens of the legacy system) created from scratch, but this can be an expensive and time-consuming process.\n\nSome examples and reasons behind software brittleness:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1805451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805451", "title": "Kaapse Klopse", "text": "Kaapse Klopse\n\nThe Kaapse Klopse (or simply Klopse) is a minstrel festival that takes place annually on 2 January and it is also referred to as Tweede Nuwe jaar (Second New Year), in Cape Town, South Africa. As many as 13,000 minstrels take to the streets garbed in bright colours, either carrying colourful umbrellas or playing an array of musical instruments. The minstrels are self organised into klopse (\"clubs\" in Kaapse Afrikaans, but more accurately translated as troupes in English). Participants are typically from Afrikaans-speaking working class Cape coloured families who have preserved the custom since the mid-19th century.\n\nPeople consider the festival a rite of renewal that has been shaped by the Cape's history. The events that are associated with Klopse in the festive season include competitions for the Christmas Choirs, Cape Malay Choirs and Cape minstrel choirs.\n\nUnder apartheid it was called the Coon Carnival by Capetonians, but local authorities have since renamed the festival the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival as the term \"coon\" is racist and derogatory.\n\nOn the eve of 1 January, people will gather in the Bo-Kaap (Malay Quarter in Signal Hill) to await the \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" (2 January) with the songs of Malay choirs and ghoema drums ushering in the dawn of a New Year.\nDuring the 19th century, the New Year was celebrated by the Dutch and was considered to be the biggest annual feast. Slaves would get a day off on 2 January and were allowed to celebrate in their own manner. Slavery was officially abolished in the Cape on 1 December 1834. The \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" became a celebration that united the \"creole culture\" in Cape Town. It is estimated that the first carnival troupe was organised in 1887.\nIn the Apartheid years the Cape Minstels sang songs like 'Dis'n nuwe jaar'( It's a new year, and many local songs, etc., which was more true to the Cape province and the local milieu the general.\nHowever the new Government led by the ANC came to power, and the Minstels elected to play more political songs as the parade's finance came from the ANC government.\n\nThis carnival gang situation was previously been influenced and supported to some extent by the Apartheid NP government, although they kept the drug trade in check.\nModern Cape Minstrel tradition was influenced by the visit to the Cape by American minstrels. Old Cape minstrels, such as \"The Ethiopians\", had their own collection of Dutch and American songs. These minstrels used to parade the streets of Cape Town and serenade the locals with their songs. An etching by Heinrich Egersdorfer in 1884 depicted those regular marches by the local chapter of the Salvation Army, which included many of the locals, could have contributed to the style of the marching that the Klopse displays today.\nIn 1862, the then internationally renowned Christy's Minstrels visited the Cape from the United States and in 1890 Orpheus McAdoo's Virginia Jubilee Singers performed in Cape Town. The Christy's Minstrels were caucasian men and women who had blackened their faces with burnt cork to impersonate the African American slaves. Between July 1890 and June 1898 they staged many minstrel shows in Cape Town and it is believed that this contributed to the birth of the Cape Minstrels and the Coon Carnival. The visitors’ influence on the Coon Carnival included the tradition of painting their faces black and whited out their eyes to look like \"racoons\".\nIn the 1900s, the celebrations took place at various locations. In 1907 Green Point Cricket Club organised the first formal Carnival and moved it to the Green Point Track which later became a tradition. The events continued in 1908 and 1909, but discontinued thereafter until 26 January 1920, when the leader of the African People Organization, Dr A Abdurahman, re-instated the \"Grand Carnival on Green Point Track\". In 1921, the Cape Town Cricket Club held a rival carnival in Newlands and this was the start of minstrel competitions in various venues and by various organising boards. New Year Carnivals of the 1920s and 1930s brought Minstrels, Privates, Brass Bands, Choirs and Malay Choirs together.\n\nThe Group Areas Act of 1966 declared District Six a whites only area resulting in approximately 60,000 residents being evicted and moved to parts of the Cape Flats, such as Manenberg and Mitchells Plain. The implementation of the Group Areas Act resulted in communities losing their sense of belonging to the communities they grew up in because of the forced removals. The Minstrel performances were spread across the Cape Peninsula to various areas. In 1967, the Carnival was banned from its home at the Green Point stadium. In 1968 there were no Minstrels parading in the Cape Town CBD. Transportation to attend rehearsals became an additional challenge and expense for the different competing minstrel groups. During the 1970s, the traffic by laws and the \"Illegal Gathering Act\" were used to place additional challenges on the minstrel festival organizers. From 1971, Athlone Stadium was used for the 'non-white' spectators. In 1977, all Minstrel marches were forbidden in any part of Cape Town and as a result people lost interest in watching the parade. The event was moved between various stadiums in order to keep it alive until 1989, when the event returned to its original route: from District Six to the Green Point stadium.\n\n\"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" (2nd New Year) is a day that is unique to Cape Town and stems from practices associated with the slavery and its history is linked with the Coon Carnival. In the mid- nineteenth century, the Cape slaves were given a day off from their duties on 2 January every year. During this alternate New Year celebration, the slaves would dress up as minstrels and dance rhythmically to the sounds of banjos, guitars, ghoema drums, whistles, trombones and tubas.\n\"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" is a celebration of a community's survival. It illustrates the continuity between its past, present and future. The now deceased iconic musician Taliep Petersen, is claimed to have said of \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" celebrations, \"\"Dis onse dag\"\" (\"It is our day\"). It is a day when the local working class community which survived slavery, segregation and Apartheid celebrates its existence and perseverance\n\nIn 1880–1890, celebration bands and groups linked as societies with sports clubs with distinguishable emblems and dress, paraded through the city and suburbs on New Year's Eve. These societies prepared special costumes for New Year's and these became a crucial part of the event. More than 60 minstrel troupes, some a 1000 strong have been known to participate in the marches. Minstrel troupes are fiercely competitive and the preparations leading towards the parade, costumes and performances are kept as secrets until the big reveal on the day. They compete for trophies such as the 'Champion of Champions award'. This award has been won by the Pennsylvanians for 10 years in succession. The minstrel troupes give a sense of pride and community to the group members. The \"Ghoema\" drum is the common thread that binds together all the music of the carnival.\nUntil mid-1900s, competitions were organised by individual promoters. Boards appeared and disappeared – \"Cape Peninsula Coon Carnival Board\", \"Western Province Jubilee Carnival Board\" (Jimmy WG Allen), \"Cape Western Coon Carnival Board\" (directed by Sonny Loyd). The majority of the troupes are represented by the 'Kaapse Klopse Karnaval Association' which is one of the break-away Associations from the \"Kaapse Karnaval\" (\"Cape Carnival\") Association. Today, the Cape Town Minstrels Carnival Association oversees the organisation the Minstrel carnival.\n\nThe music associated with Minstrel history and \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" was influenced by a variety of sources. In the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were sent to the Cape of Good Hope from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India and East Africa (Madagascar), creating a melting pot of culture and influence. The British garrisons of the era influenced the marching processions of the minstrel troupes and a substantial collection of songs draw their origins from the Netherlands\n. The Cape slaves together with the local Khoisan population where known to sing in choirs as part of the celebrations. They also watched the colonial troops parade in Cape Town while singing \"God save the Queen\". Traces of African, Asian and European music can be heard in the Minstrel music. The \"ghoema\" beat reflects rhythmic similarities of India, Indonesia, Africa and the Middle East. Therefore, \"Ghoemaliedjies\" (Ghoema songs) are reminiscent of the music from Africa, Asia and Europe. \"Melodies\" and \"moppies\" have Western origins and were strongly influenced by African–American music (possibly associated with the exposure to the visiting American Minstrels). The cinemas across District Six also exerted the jazz influence and the re-enactment of famous actors and singers in the performances.\nThe evolution of the Cape slave \"social fabric\" included the development of their own music and dance which was used to grow social cohesion and celebrate whatever freedoms they were granted.\n\nWell known songs sung by minstrels:it was a very hard time \n\nOn New Year's Eve, the Cape Malay Choirs or \"nagtroepe\" march through Cape Town. Thereafter, the minstrels parade through the city and on \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\", 2 January, the troupes and choirs take to the Green Point Stadium. Present day, the competition starts on the afternoon of 1 January and continues on 2 January and the following two Saturdays.\n\nCategories that are judged as part of the competitions include,\nThe competition is judged by a panel of independent adjudicators and every group scores in each of the categories. The winners of the 2013 competition can be viewed on the Cape Town Minstrels Carnival Association.\n\nWhile many troupes now are supported by corporate sponsors, many refuse and remain sticklers for tradition. The 2005 carnival was nearly cancelled due to an alleged lack of funding, while the 2006 carnival was officially called off for the same reason. However, the troupe organisations subsequently decided to go ahead with the parade despite continued unhappiness over funding, and the festivities were opened by Western Cape premier Ebrahim Rasool on 2 January 2006.\n\nModern celebration of \"Tweede Nuwe Jaar\" is a reminder of the slave past of colonial Cape Town, the importance of music and dance as part of the celebration of freedom. The \"klopse\" has played a significant role in addressing social challenges like crime, drug abuse, and AIDS. It is also used to build bridges between the communities after the apartheid era. Apart from providing entertainment, the \"Kaapse Klopse\" has also become a means of building skills in the community. The \"Kaapse Klopse\" and associated choir singing give the participating children the opportunity to learn the art of performing music and dance and exposed them to practising music three times a week in preparation for their performances. These activities paved the way for world-famous musicians like Taliep Petersen and Jonathan Butler who both received the 'Juvenile Sentimental Trophy' awards in previous competitions.\nThe skills extend beyond singing, dancing, playing musical instruments and sewing but also include skills associated with events management such as planning, project management and mobilising a diverse group of people, young and old. The singing and dancing has been proven a source of income and engendered a sense of pride in the communities where joblessness is a concern and frustration. During apartheid, children from previously disadvantaged communities were denied access to performance arts at school.\n\nResidents of the Bo-Kaap have complained about the noise and petty crime that accompanies the festival, and, in 2011, the City of Cape Town restricted parading in the Bo Kaap.

He was educated in public schools and engaged in the mercantile and railroad industries early in his life. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1895, and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1889 to 1893. From 1889 to 1890, he was chair of the Pennsylvania Republican State Central Committee. When the voters \"retired him from office\" in 1902, Andrews moved to Sierra County, New Mexico, where he managed a gold mine (the mining camp now ghost town of Andrews, New Mexico, northeast of Hillsboro, was named for him). He later moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico to get himself re-involved in politics.\n\nAndrews became an astute and dominant politician in territorial New Mexico. A year after arriving, he was elected to the New Mexico Territorial Council. He was elected to Congress in 1905 (narrowly defeating Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo), and reelected twice, serving in the 59th, 60th and 61st Congress, 1905–1911 until New Mexico became a state.\n\nAndrews, working with old contacts in the federal government from his days in Pennsylvania politics, was influential in obtaining statehood for New Mexico.

His body was shipped back to his home in Titusville, Pennsylvania and buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. He spent a fortune in politics, always hopeful that he would get a seat in the U.S. Senate. Ironically, Albert B. Fall, after being appointed to a Cabinet position in 1921, said that if Andrews were still alive, he would have convinced the Governor to appoint him to Fall's senate seat.\n"}

Established in Florida in 1981 by Jorge Mas Canosa and Raúl Masvidal, CANF is an organization with numerous members in the United States and other countries. Following the death of Jorge Mas Canosa in November 1997, CANF began to lose its ideological cohesion provided by Mas Canosa, which led a substantial segment of its membership to split and form the Cuban Liberty Council in 2001.\n\nCANF used to be a strong advocate for isolation of Cuba by the USA but in April 2009 they published an article calling for lifting US restrictions on aid and travel to Cuba, and aiding civil society groups there.\n\nCANF has offices in Miami, Washington, D.C. and New Jersey and chapters in Los Angeles, the greater New York area, Chicago, several cities in Florida, Puerto Rico, New Orleans, and Texas.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, it received a quarter million dollars from the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization financed by the US government.\n\nCANF also operates the radio station \"La Voz de la Fundación\" which it attempts to transmit to Cuba and led the effort to establish the U.S. Information Agency's Radio Martí (1985) and TV Martí (1990). Radio Martí and TV Martí are official U.S. broadcasting operations directed to the Cuban people.\n\nThe Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) claims as its mission, the unwavering commitment to bring freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights to Cuba. Arguing that sustainable change must come from within, CANF's mission aims to identify independent civil society leaders as agents of change, and support their efforts to restore and rebuild Cuban society – a society that they argue has suffered for generations under the repression of dictatorship.\n\nIn 1981 Cuban exile Jorge Mas Canosa founded the Cuban American National Foundation. Jorge Mas Canosa was born and raised in the city of Santiago de Cuba on September 21, 1939. As a student leader, Mas Canosa fought against the dictatorial oppression of first Batista and eventually Castro. He was forced to seek exile in Miami where he pursued what he saw as a free Cuba. He took part in the CIA sponsored Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the states, he married his high school sweetheart Irma Santos and started a family of three sons: Jorge, Juan Carlos, and Jose Ramon.\n\nThe foundation has been accused by the Cuban government of planning and funding terrorist attacks within Cuba, including a September 1997 bombing that killed an Italian tourist in Havana. Most notably, the Cuban-born anti-Castro terrorist Luis Posada Carriles claimed in 1998 that he received financial support from the Cuban American National Foundation for a bombing campaign carried out in 1997, although he has denied ties with the fatal attack. Posada has also been linked with the 1976 bombing of Cubana Airlines flight 455, which killed 73 passengers (all of whom were civilians). In August 1997 CANF released a statement unconditionally supporting terrorist attacks against Cuba; the CANF chairman at the time stated that \"We do not think of these as terrorist actions\".\n\nSeveral ranking members of the CANF have been the subject of major drug trafficking prosecutions, and a few even had to step down from leadership positions at the institution due to drug trafficking charges, including Gaspar Jiménez and Rolando Mendoza. Additionally, militants associated with the CANF, such as Luis Posada Carriles (who claims to have been funded by Jorge Mas Canosa) and his Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU) group, and the Contras (Pepe Hernández having been a Contra combatant, and several CANF members having ostensibly provided them with humanitarian aid), have been accused of large-scale drug trafficking.\n\nAccording to Jose Antonio Llama, former director of the executive board of CANF, the paramilitary role of CANF was established in June 1992 during an annual congress meeting in Naples, Florida. The idea was born when a member recommended \"doing more than lobbying in Washington\" to overthrow the Cuban Communist government of Fidel Castro. Jorge Mas Canosa and Francisco Jose Hernandez, known as \"Pepe\", were selected as leaders to choose the group for armed operations. Llama has maintained that foundations general board of directors were unaware, including at the time, the board chairman Jorge Mas Santos. With the group established in 1992, the following year brought about more extensive planning, including consideration on what will need to be purchased to carry out their missions. During the 1993 meeting in Puerto Rico, Jose \"Pepe\" Hernandez was selected as the group's leader due to his \"...known record as a fighter in the 2506 Brigade and the Marines.\"\n\nLlama who made a fortune installing air conditioners in Soviet vehicles, admitted in an interview with El Nuevo Herald, the plot to kill Castro and cited other members of CANF as assisting in securing items, funding and participating in the planning. Llama stated he was coming forward because CANF had stolen 1.4 million USD of his own money, between 1994 and 1997, to plan the operation which did not go forward. Llama was considering a lawsuit to recoup his money.\n\nLlamas admission came with a list of items acquired for carrying out the task of assassination, these included: a cargo helicopter, 10 ultralight radio-controlled planes, seven vessels and explosives. One of those vessels was the Midnight Express fast boat, meant to take the CANF leader at the time, Jorge Mas Canosa to Cuba if a power struggle erupted or the missions were successful. Another of those vessels was \"La Esperanza\" which was confiscated by the United States Department of the Treasury following the indictments of four cuban exiles plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro. The weapons and equipment cache on the yacht \"La Esperanza\" listed:\nThe pistol matching the .357 rounds were never discovered. One of the .50 caliber sniper rifles belonged to Francisco \"Pepe\" Hernandez, president of CANF. La Esperanza set sail from the private dock of an undisclosed CANF foundation member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Books\"\n\n\n\n\"Non-CANF websites\"\n\n\"Articles and reports\"\n"}

He performed on over 17,000 documented recording sessions, backing popular acts such as Elvis Presley and Roy Orbison. He is also the father of multi-instrumentalist R. Stevie Moore, who pioneered lo-fi music.\n\nBob Moore was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and developed his musical skills as a boy. By age 15 he was playing double bass on a tent show tour with a Grand Ole Opry musical group, and at 18, he accepted a position touring with Little Jimmy Dickens. At age 23, his abilities brought an offer to play on the famed Red Foley ABC-TV show, \"Ozark Jubilee\". Playing with the show's band in Springfield, Missouri on Saturdays and traveling to Nashville during the week proved to be exhausting, however, and after two years, he returned to Nashville.\n\nMoore was 12 years old when he met Owen Bradley, who was playing trombone in Nashville radio station WSM-AM's staff band. In 1950, Bradley hired Moore to perform on a direct-to-disk transcription which was recorded via cable from the stage of the Ryman Theatre. Soon thereafter, Bradley became the head of Nashville's division of Decca Records, and brought Moore in as a session musician. Moore went on to perform on over 17,000 documented (Federation of Musicians Local 257) recording sessions and was a key member of the Nashville A-Team, a core group of first call studio musicians, that began to coalesce in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1958, he played on his first of many Elvis Presley sessions at RCA Studio B and soundtrack. The following year he teamed up with Fred Foster to establish Monument Records, where, as the label's musical director, he created arrangements for Roy Orbison. In 1960, he formed the Bob Moore Orchestra and recorded an album which included \"Mexico\", a 1961 45 rpm single that went to number seven on the \"Billboard\" pop music chart, remaining in the Top 40 for ten weeks.

Seriphios: Serpho) is a Greek island municipality in the Aegean Sea, located in the western Cyclades, south of Kythnos and northwest of Sifnos. It is part of the Milos regional unit. The area is and the population was 1,420 at the 2011 census. It is located about ESE of Piraeus.\nIn Greek mythology, Serifos is where Danaë and her infant son Perseus washed ashore after her father Acrisius, in response to an oracle that his own grandson would kill him, set them adrift at sea in a wooden chest. When Perseus returned to Serifos with the head of the Gorgon Medusa, he turned Polydektes, the king of Serifos, and his retainers into stone as punishment for the king's attempt to marry his mother by force.\n\nIn antiquity, the island was proverbial for the alleged muteness of its frogs. During the Roman imperial period, Serifos was a place of exile. After 1204 it became a minor dependency of the Venetian dukes of the Archipelago. In the late 19th century Serifos experienced a modest economic boom from the exploitation of the island's extensive iron ore deposits. The mines closed in the 1960s, and Serifos now depends on tourism and small-scale agriculture.\n\nWorked blocks of island marble built into the walls of the medieval castle crowning Chora, the hilltop main town of Serifos, show that the ancient capital was there as well. Chance finds, primarily marble funerary sculpture, are displayed in the Archaeological Collection in Chora (open Tues.-Sun.).\nThe most impressive ancient monument is the \"Astros Pýrgos\" (Άσπρος Πύργος), a Hellenistic marble watchtower (c. 300 BC) with walls preserved to 2 m. and an interior staircase, standing on a hilltop just east of the road from Chora to Mega Livadi, near Mega Chorio. Work began in 2011 to study the fallen blocks for an eventual reconstruction.\n\nAt least four other ancient towers have been located, including the megalithic Psaros Pyrgos (Ψαρός Πύργος) or \"Couch of the Cyclops\" in the SW corner of the island. The so-called \"Castle of the Old Lady\" (Κάστρο της Γριάς) above Ganema and Koutalas preserves scant remains of a collapsed dry-stone construction in a notch below the twin rocky summits. Rough fragments of white marble and rooftile, and archaic fine-ware potsherds on the SE terraces of the hillside suggest the existence of an ancient sanctuary.\n\nThe fortified Monastery of the Taxiarchs, dedicated to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, was built in 1572 just outside the village of Galani. The sole monk is Archimandrite Makarios, who entered the monastery as a youth in 1958 and continues to maintain it.\n\nSeriphos was colonised by Ionians from Athens, and it was one of the few islands which refused submission to Xerxes I. By subsequent writers Seriphos is almost always mentioned with contempt on account of its poverty and insignificance; and it was for this reason employed by the Roman emperors as a place of banishment for state criminals. It is curious that the ancient writers make no mention of the iron and copper mines of Seriphos, which were, however, worked in antiquity, as is evident from existing traces, and which, one might have supposed, would have bestowed some prosperity upon the island. But though the ancient writers are silent about the mines, they are careful to relate that the frogs of Seriphos differ from the rest of their fraternity by being mute.\n\nThe anarchosyndicalist Konstantinos Speras was an organizer of the August 1916 miners' strike on Serifos. The royalist police killed four workers as part of the strike's events.\n\nIn the 20th century, the mines of Serifos were exploited by the mining company \"Société des mines de Seriphos-Spiliazeza,\" under the direction of German mineralogist A. Grohmann (died 1905). In the summer of 1916, in response to low pay, excessive working hours, poor safety conditions, and the company's refusal to rehire workers who had been drafted into the Greek army and recently demobilized, the 460 miners formed a union and organized a strike. Their leader was Constantinos Speras, a Serifos native educated in Egypt, who was an anarcho-syndicalist with long experience of labour struggles on the Greek mainland. In response to the strike, Grohman asked for the help of Greek authorities, who sent a 30-man gendarmerie (Χωροφυλακή) detachment from nearby Kea. After detaining Speras and the strike committee, the gendarmerie lieutenant ordered his men to fire on the workers, who had gathered at the ore loading dock at Megalo Livadi and refused to permit a cargo ship to be loaded. Four workers were killed and a dozen wounded. The workers, supported by their wives, attacked the gendarmes with stones, killing three of them and routing the others. The freed leadership took control of island institutions and sent a message placing Serifos under protection of the French fleet at Milos. This effort at collective proletarian self-organisation was cut short by the refusal of the French navy to intervene, and by the arrival of a Greek warship. Speras was arrested and charged with high treason, but released a few months later when the royalist government was ousted. Grohmann was given once again the control of the mines, after granting improved working conditions and an 8-hour workday.\n\n\n\n"}

He became captain of the side within a short period, helping them reach the 1997 and 1998 League Cup finals and also winning the top division title in 1999.\n\nIn his last years with Bordeaux, it was rumoured that Pavon would move to Olympique de Marseille – although raised in that area, he gave his heart to Bordeaux and ignored the rumours, playing his last match on 26 August 2000 against RC Lens. After four successful seasons he finally left the \"Girondins\" to play in his father's native country, signing a three-year contract with Real Betis in Segunda División; after only ten matches to help the Andalusians win promotion to La Liga, he decided to retire at the age of 32 after suffering a serious injury.\n\nOn 24 October 2003, Pavon became head coach at Bordeaux after replacing the dismissed Élie Baup, earning a two-year extension at the season's end. In 2004–05, he suffered from a heart problem which caused him to miss the last three games of the campaign, and president Jean-Louis Triaud announced in June 2005 that the manager was standing down; he continued his work at the club in a scouting function, as Ricardo Gomes took charge.\n\nIn late May 2010, Pavon returned again to Bordeaux, being named newly appointed coach Jean Tigana's assistant. In February of the following year, he left his post.\n\nPavon worked in lower league and amateur football in the following years, being in charge of ES Blanquefort and FC Libourne.\n\n"}

He was successively followed by Fathers Dennis Maudet, SS.CC., Stanislaus Lebret, SS.CC., and Eustache Maheu, SS.CC. Father Maheu built the Waiāpuka Catholic Church and dedicated it to Saint Louis. Father Maheu died on August 25, 1860.\n\nSaint Damien de Veuster of Molokai, SS.CC., served as the pastor of the Kohala mission for eight years from 1865 until 1873. During his tenure, he built the first Kohala Catholic Church at Halawa, dedicated under the title of Our Lady of Victory. Father Gulstan Ropert, SS.CC., followed Father Damien in 1873, building the first Catholic school on the island dedicated under the title of Saint Ann at Halaula. Father Ropert constructed another church (since demolished) in Kapaau dedicated under the title of Saint Anthony of Padua located between the Bond Memorial Library and the Kohala Dispensary.\n\nThe first Sacred Heart Church was built in Hawi in 1905 by Father Aloysius Borghouts, SS.CC.; this church was later moved to Halawa. The second and present structure was built by Father Ludger Appleman, SS.CC., in 1925. This cruciform church, with beautiful stained-glass windows and ecclesiastical appointments was consecrated by co-adjutor Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands, Msgr.

The church was consecrated under the title of St. Patrick, Bishop of Armagh. Its Romanesque architecture, as well as its fine ecclesiastical appointments such as stained glass windows and pipe organ, are attractive to prospective couples seeking nuptial rites.\n\nAlthough it falls under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Honolulu, the parish is owned by the Fathers and Brothers of the Sacred Hearts (Picpus) through papal indult and in recognition of the missionary efforts of the Picpus congregation in establishing the church in the Hawaiian Islands. The church is frequently the site of religious professions, ordinations and obsequies for the members of the Hawaiian Province of the Picpus congregation.\n\nMsgr. Libert Boeynaems, SS.CC., Bishop of the Titular See of Zeugma and Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands, acquired the land on dry, rocky volcanic slope of Kaimuki for a church in 1901. Meanwhile, the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts acquired a lot just west of the church lot and in 1909 had their convent and their school (Academy of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary) blessed. By 1917, Kaimuki was developed and the convent chapel, dedicated under the title of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque was open to the public for Sunday worship. A church was needed and the Vicar Apostolic instructed Father Athanasius Bous, SS.CC., to initiate work on building a new church for Kaimuki, securing the services of architect, R. A. Fishbourne. A Romanesque cruciform structure was completed in 1929 and was solemnly dedicated on February 10, 1929, by Msgr. Stephen Peter Alencastre, SS.CC., Bishop of the Titular See of Arabissus and the (final) Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. The church was furnished with stained glass windows and two bells from Brussels. Statues, altars, pulpit and vestments were donated by parishioners. With the installation of a pipe organ, the church was complete.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, Father Andrew LaRiviere, SS.CC., transformed the front of the church property into an open space suitable for parking on Sundays. In 1935 a passing Benedictine monk drew a set of plans for a monastery for the priests and brothers of the Sacred Hearts congregation. The plan came to fruition and a monastery-rectory consonant with the church's Romanesque architecture served the church until 1963, when pastor Father Albert Leunens, SS.CC., constructed a new rectory in the Romanesque style made separate from the monastery.\n\nFr. Clyde Gurriero, ss.cc. is the current Pastor.\nFr. Bertram Lock, ss.cc. is the current Parochial Vicar\nFr. Micheal Kumar, ss.cc is the current Parochial Vicar\n\nA school was opened in September 1930, built with wood salvaged from the old Saint Louis College on River Street. The school was staffed by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts and started with three grades. Eventually, the school consisted of eight grades and a kindergarten. With the increasing population in Kaimuki, the school was expanded to a double school in 1943, due to the efforts of two carpenter religious, Brothers Sylvester Barbe, SS.CC., and Wenceslaus Van Vorst, SS.CC. In January 1950, a fire destroyed the auditorium and all but two classrooms. Father Lawrence Mampaey, SS.CC., immediately set out to rebuild the school with the assistance of volunteers and parishioners. By summer of 1950, a new 16-classroom building designed by architect Edwin L. Bauer and built by Pacific Construction Company was showcased during an open house.\n\nThe parish school is currently staffed by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts and lay staff. Sister Anne Clare De Costa, SS.CC., is the principal. The parish is administered by Fathers and Brothers of the Sacred Hearts. The current pastor of the parish is Father Clyde Guerreiro, SS.CC., assisted by parochial vicars Fathers Bertram Lock, SS.CC., and Father Micheal Kumar, SS.CC. The parish and the school have recently celebrated their 75th anniversaries, and a major capital improvement plan for the school and parish is in development.\n\nThe school has launched a three-year program to restructure the teaching learning environment.

Kevin's nickname among his friends is \"King Royal\".\n\nHooks lived in Southwest, Washington, D.C. in the late-1970s. He attended Potomac High School in Oxon Hill, Maryland.\n\nWhen he was still 10, Kevin starred in the acclaimed \"J.T.\", a 1969 episode of the \"CBS Children's Hour\" about a thoughtful Harlem youth who befriends a sick cat. Written by Jane Wagner, it was a Peabody Award winner yet is not readily commercially available to rent or buy.\n\nHooks appeared in the hit 1972 movie (\"Sounder\") as the pre-teen elder son of Paul Winfield's and Cicely Tyson's characters, providing the point of view of the film. He held the story together as a boy thrust into being \"man of the family\" on a sharecropping farm during the Depression. The adults were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress Oscars respectively for their performances.\n\nHooks won a role in the last film directed by Gordon Parks, Jr. (\"Super Fly\"), \"Aaron Loves Angela\" (1975). Set in contemporary Harlem at New York's grittiest and most depressing ebb, that film was regarded as a \"blaxploitation\" version of \"Romeo and Juliet\", using African American and Puerto Rican ethnicity in lieu of medieval families. While playing a withdrawn teenager, he created electricity opposite the 15-year-old Irene Cara. Jose Feliciano in a bit part and a little comic relief lighten the grimness, as the young lovers encounter nothing but intolerance and the secret location where they meet becomes the site of a dangerous drug deal. The movie was popular locally and praised by fans, but widely considered a weakly plotted failure.\n\nHooks went on to portray high school basketball player Morris Thorpe in the successful TV series about high-school basketball, \"The White Shadow\", which ran from 1978 to 1981. Morris Thorpe was reportedly voted one of America's 100 favorite characters in the history of television.\n\nIn 1986, he starred in the short-lived ABC sitcom \"He's the Mayor\". \n\nIn 1991, Hooks directed the film \"Strictly Business\", and also appeared in one scene opposite Kim Coles. He directed Wesley Snipes in \"Passenger 57\", Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin in \"Fled\", and also Patrick Swayze in \"Black Dog\". Hooks worked as a director and producer on the series \"Prison Break\". He also directed two episodes from the first season of \"Lost\", \"White Rabbit\" and \"Homecoming\".\n\nIn 2003, Hooks revisited \"Sounder\". He directed ABC's Wonderful World of Disney's TV remake of the film, with Paul Winfield, his co-star from the original, playing a different role.\n\nHooks directed the following episodes of \"Prison Break\":\n\n\nHe also directed the film \"\" (2009) based on the series.\n\nHooks is also credited as the director of the 2017 Madiba, a three-part BET television special about the life of the late Nelson Mandela and the struggle of the ANC which with the leadership of Mandela, famously succeeded to overthrow the regime of apartheid in South Africa, starring Laurence Fishburne in the role of Mandela.\n\nHe also directed episode 12 of \"The Punisher\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1805538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805538", "title": "Data cap", "text": "Data cap\n\nA data cap, often erroneously referred to as a bandwidth cap, is an artificial restriction imposed on the transfer of data over a network. In particular, it refers to policies imposed by an internet service provider in order to limit customers' usage of their services; typically, exceeding a data cap would require the subscriber to pay additional fees based on whether they have exceeded this limit. Implementation of a bandwidth cap is sometimes termed a fair access policy, fair usage policy, or usage-based billing by ISPs.\n\nU.S. ISPs have asserted that bandwidth caps are required in order to provide a \"fair\" service to their respective subscribers. The use of bandwidth caps has been criticized for becoming increasingly unnecessary, as decreasing infrastructure costs have made it cheaper for ISPs to increase the capacity of their networks to keep up with the demands of their users, rather than place arbitrary limits on usage. It has also been asserted that bandwidth caps are meant to help protect pay television providers that may also be owned by an ISP from competition with over-the-top streaming services.\n\nAlthough often referred to as a \"bandwidth cap\", it is not the actual bandwidth (bits per second) that is limited, but the total amount of data downloaded per month.\n\nGenerally, each user of a network is expected to use high speed transmission for a short time, for example to download a megabyte web page in less than a second. Continuous usage, such as when sharing files or streaming videos can seriously impair service for others. In DSL, where the core network is shared but the access network is not, this concept is less relevant. However, it becomes more relevant in cable internet, where both the core network and the access network are shared, and on wireless networks, where the total network bandwidth is also relatively narrow.\n\nIn 2016, U.S. provider Comcast offered a service plan with a data cap of 1 terabyte. At contemporary data consumption rates, each member of a family of four would need to separately watch 100 movies in a month to approach the cap. In that case, typical data usage habits would not exceed that cap.\n\n\"Unlimited data\" is a marketing promotion in which an Internet service provider offers access to Internet without cutting service at the data cap. However, after a user passes some data cap, the provider will begin bandwidth throttling to decrease the user's speed of access to data, slowing down the user's internet use.\n\nAs of October 2015, there were 58 wired broadband providers in the US that used data caps, among them major wireless cell phone providers such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T.\n\nBefore 2010 there was a trend of providing unlimited data without bandwidth throttling. In the United States the Federal Communications Commission has fined service providers for offering unlimited data in a way that misled consumers. In June 2015, the FCC fined AT&T Mobility for misleading consumers. In October 2016 the FCC reached a settlement with T-Mobile in which they would pay for failing to disclose restrictions on their unlimited data plans.\n\nU.S. internet service providers have most recently asserted that data caps are needed in order to provide \"fair\", tiered services at different price points based on speed and usage.\n\nIn 2016, Sonic.net CEO Dane Jasper criticized the historical assertions that data caps are meant to conserve network capacity, arguing that the cost of actually delivering service had \"declined much faster than the increase in data traffic\". When Sonic was first established in 2008, its infrastructure costs were equivalent to 20% of its revenue, but these had fallen to only 1.5% by 2016 because of the declining costs of equipment. Suddenlink CEO Jerry Kent made a similar assertion in an investors' call, stating that the \"days\" of having to make investments to keep up with customer demand were \"over\", and there would be \"significant free cash flow generated from the cable operators as our capital expenditures continue to come down.\"\n\nAs most major U.S. internet providers own television providers, it has also been suggested that data caps are intended to discourage users from dropping their pay television subscriptions by placing \"de facto\" restrictions on the use of competing streaming video services that are delivered over the internet, such as Netflix. The lobbying group Internet Association additionally argued that data caps are meant to create \"artificial scarcity\", especially in markets where there is limited competition in broadband, also pointing out that some providers offer their own streaming video services that are exempted from data cap policies, such as Comcast's Stream TV. Comcast defended the exemption by stating that the service is not delivered over the public internet; it can only be used while connected to the provider's home Wi-Fi router.\n\n\n"}

The term is most commonly used as a form of synecdoche to refer to a handful of the most common registry systems in the United States, \"The New American Registry\", \"The First American Registry\", \"The Registry Saferent\", and \"The U.D. Registry\".\n\nEach registry automatically receives a notification from various metropolitan housing courts whenever any tenant is sued by a landlord. In areas without housing courts, lists of named defendants in unlawful detainer (eviction) suits will be compiled from court records. Usually there is a period of time before those records become public, and if the suit is resolved before that, the names will not be listed. Even if the tenant successfully defends themselves, they are kept in the registries. In addition, there are procedures by which landlords can report tenants who skip or are habitually late paying rent. Almost all landlords subscribe to these major registry services and screen potential applicants; many landlords will reject tenants on the basis of their presence in the registry, because the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior.\n\n\n"}

The name means \"Falconbrook\" in German.\n\nThey are one of the very first Viking metal bands, starting in 1989, with their first release that same year. The one permanent member is Vratyas Vakyas (real name Markus Tümmers) who was born in Germany, but lived in Iceland in the late 1980s. \n\nFalkenbach was one of Germany's first examples of what would be labeled pagan metal. The band was formed in Iceland in 1989, when it recorded the \"Hávamál\" demo, and has recorded a total of seven demos; however, only five are known. Three more were released by 1995: \"Skínn af sverði sól valtíva\" (Old Norse, \"\"The Sun Shines on the Swords of Slaughter-Gods\"\"), \"Læknishendr\" (Old Norse, \"\"Healing Hands\"\"), and \"Ásynja\" (Old Norse, \"\"Goddess\"\"). Of all of these except \"Læknishendr\", only nine copies were released.\n\nIn 1995, recording of the debut album \"Fireblade\" began, but due to equipment troubles, production was stopped shortly before mixing began. \"Fireblade\" was not released, and in December of the same year, recording began for \"...En their medh ríki fara...\" (Old Norse, \"\"...And in Glory Will They Go...\"\"). The recording for this actual debut album was completed in March 1996. The album cover features a part of an illustration of the Wild Hunt, made by Friedrich Wilhelm Heine for Wilhelm Wägner's \"Nordisch-germanische Götter und Helden\" (1882). With this Falkenbach placed itself within a tradition that connects metal music to the Wild Hunt motif, present since Bathory's album \"Blood Fire Death\" (1988).\n\nAfter \"...Magni blandinn ok megintiri...\" (Old Norse, \"\"Mixed with Strength and Pride Glory\"\") was released, Vratyas stopped recording music so he could focus more on his record label \"Skaldic Art Productions\".\n\nIn 2003, Vratyas returned to the studio with three other musicians and close friends to record \"Ok nefna tysvar Ty\" (Old Norse, \"\"And Name Twice Týr\"\"). The next \"Falkenbach album\", \"Heralding – The Fireblade\", was recorded in August–September 2005, using the same session musicians he had used for \"Ok Nefna Tysvar Ty\". It includes material originally intended for the never released \"Fireblade\" album and re-working of demo tracks.\n\nIn 2006 \"Skaldic Arts Productions\" released a tribute album called \"An Homage to Falkenbach\". It consists of two parts, each limited to 500 units. The work contains 16 covers by various bands such as \"Eluveitie\", \"Folkearth\", and \"Bewitched\".\n\nVratyas Vakyas (whose name roughly translates to \"the searching wanderer\"), the sole member of \"Falkenbach\", lives in Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nThe \"Hávamál\" demo is allegedly clean folk music, but since then the sound has become more raw and influenced by black metal influence and matured into an epic metal sound.\n\nMost of \"Falkenbach\" lyrics are in English. They also write lyrics in Old Norse, Latin, and Old German. Most, if not all of the lyrics in Old Norse are actually taken from heathen literature: for example, the chorus lines in the song \"\"Donar's Oak\"\" are actually verses four and five of \"Grímnismál\", a poem of the Elder Edda. (\"Hávamál\", after which the first demo is named, is another such poem.)\n\nAccording to Vratyas, one thing that sets Falkenbach apart from a band such Bathory is that his music is underpinned by a pagan religiosity. Vratyas defines his approach to paganism as animistic, through which it rejects the existence of a frontier between a person and the outer world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and China. In other countries such as South Africa it is known as Axe.\n\nAxe was launched in France in 1983 by Unilever. It was inspired by another of Unilever's brands, Impulse. Unilever introduced many products in the range, but were forced to use the name Lynx in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand due to trademark issues with the Axe name. In addition, some countries (such as South Africa) introduced the brand as EGO.\n\nScents have evolved over time. From 1983 until about 1989, the variant names were descriptions of the fragrances and included \"Musk\", \"Spice\", \"Amber\", \"Oriental\", and \"Marine\". From 1990 until 1996, geographic names for fragrances were used. In 2009, the brand launched an eight-centimetre container called the Axe Bullet. The brand has also extended into other areas.\n\nMost scent names usually have a shower gel to accompany them and sometimes an antiperspirant/deodorant stick and an aftershave lotion. The Axe Shampoos come in three different sizes, regular size, travel or sample size of and XL bottles. Axe also ships a shower scrub tool called the Axe Detailer.\n\nAxe also launches limited edition variants from time to time that may be on sale for a few months or over a year.\n\nFrom the 1990s, Axe advertisements portrayed various ways the products supposedly helped men attract women. In 2003, the advertising in the UK for the \"Pulse\" fragrance showed how it supposedly gave \"geeky\" men the confidence to woo women with dance. In 2005, Consumer Expert Dr. Vince Wong, CEO of Insights Interactive, was hired to help explore cross cultural behavioral motivations of their young male adult consumers. This fed into development of the brand globally, resulting in award-winning global communication campaigns. This was followed by \"Touch\", \"Unlimited\", \"Clix\", and in 2007, \"Vice\", which was marketed on a theme of making \"nice\" women become \"naughty\".\n\nAdverse publicity has been generated by the product's advertisements for encouraging sexual promiscuity and sexism. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood claimed that Bartle Bogle Hegarty's work on Axe \"epitomizes the sexist and degrading marketing that can undermine girls' healthy development.\"\n\nOn January 12, 2008 12-year-old Daniel Hurley from Derbyshire, England died in a hospital five days after collapsing at his home. The medical coroner ruled that he had suffered from cardiac arrhythmia and died from heart failure as a result of spraying large amounts of Lynx in a confined space. Videos on social networking sites depicted teens setting themselves on fire. The trend resulted in multiple injuries. After these incidents occurred, the company created two ads, one against the use of Axe as an inhalant, and the other warning of its flammability.\n\nAxe initiated a marketing campaign whereby the company would select people in a worldwide contest to become astronauts who would fly sub-orbital space missions aboard the XCOR Lynx spaceplane. On December 5, 2013, Axe announced the 23 space cadets, one of which was Chino Roque, who had won the extensive training competition held at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The winners were from 23 different countries, some of which did not have space agencies or had not produced any astronauts before. The suborbital rides would take place after the unbuilt XCOR Lynx rocket would have passed flight test objectives.\n\nAxe had a product placement deal with Sega to feature its deodorant in the game \"Yakuza 3\". This licence was not renewed for the 2018 remaster, and it was instead replaced by a generic product.\n\n"}

Unlike most popes who first serve as monks, Agathon had never been a monk prior to becoming pope- yet he was successful. \nDuring his time as pope, the building of St. Macarius Church in the monastery at Wadi El Natrun was completed.\n\nMore importantly, he wrote a letter about the nature of Christ, a technicality which is recited by Christians when they recite the Nicene Creed. His letter was given consideration, read and discussed at the Third Council of Constantinople. (The Third Council of Constantinople is counted as the Sixth Ecumenical Council by the Orthodox and other churches). This was a very important event, presided by the pope, where semantics about the nature of Christ and how to reflect that nature in the creed spoken by Christians around the world; was discussed and agreed upon.\n\nLike many others before and after, according to the Coptic Orthodox Church, he was harassed. Sometime during his papacy, he was persecuted by a Melkite Byzantine Patriarch named Theodocius, who through his authority, levied large taxes on Agathon, made the people hate him and asked that he be killed. For this reason, Agathon stayed hidden in his cell until the threat of Theodocius went away. Based on church beliefs, he chose his successor based on a dream where an angel told him who should follow him.\n\n"}

The term only applies to saturated motifs, as such compounds like 2-chlorophenol would not normally be considered halohydrins. Megatons of some chlorohydrins, e.g. propylene chlorohydrin, are produced annually as precursors to polymers.\n\nHalohydrins may be categorized as chlorohydrins, bromohydrins, fluorohydrins or iodohydrins depending on the halogen present.\n\nHalohydrins are usually prepared by treatment of an alkene with a halogen, in the presence of water. The reaction is a form of electrophilic addition, similar to the halogen addition reaction and proceeds with anti addition, leaving the newly added X and OH groups in a trans configuration. The chemical equation for the conversion of ethylene to ethylene chlorohydrin is:\n\nWhen bromination is desired, \"N\"-bromosuccinimide (NBS) can be preferable to bromine because fewer side-products are produced.\n\nHalohydrins may also be prepared from the reaction of an epoxide with a hydrohalic acid, or a metal halide.\n\nThe reaction is produced on an industrial scale for the production of chlorohydrin precursors to two important epoxides, epichlorohydrin and propylene oxide. At one time, 2-chloroethanol was produced on a large scale as a precursor to ethylene oxide, but the latter is now prepared by the direct oxidation of ethylene.\n\nIn presence of a base halohydrins undergo internal S2 reaction to form epoxides. Industrially, the base is calcium hydroxide, whereas in the laboratory, potassium hydroxide is often used.\n\nThis reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction from an epoxide and can be considered a variant of the Williamson ether synthesis. Most of the world's supply of propylene oxide arises via this route.\n\nSuch reactions can form the basis of more complicated processes, for example epoxide formation is one of the key steps in the Darzens reaction.\n\nCompounds such as 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, which contain multiple geminal halogens adjacent to a hydroxyl group may be considered halohydrins (although, strictly speaking, they fail the IUPAC definition) as they possess similar chemistry. In particular they also undergo intramolecular cyclisation to form dihaloepoxy groups. These species are both highly reactive and synthetically useful, forming the basis of the Jocic-Reeve reaction, Bargellini reaction and Corey–Link reaction.\n\nAs with any functional group, the hazards of halohydrins are difficult to generalize as they may form part of an almost limitless series of compounds, with each structure having different pharmacology. In general, simpler low molecular weight compounds are often toxic and carcinogenic (e.g. 2-chloroethanol, 3-MCPD) by virtue of being alkylating agents. This reactivity can be put to good use, for instance in the anti-cancer drug mitobronitol. A number of synthetic corticosteroids exist bearing a fluorohydrin motif (triamcinolone, dexamethasone).\n\nDespite their rather suggestive names epichlorohydrin and sulfuric chlorohydrin are not halohydrins.\n\n"}

The film starred Tommy Lee Jones, Ed Flanders and Tovah Feldshuh. \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" recounts the life and times of Howard Hughes, and was made within a year of Hughes's death in April 1976. It was originally broadcast in two parts on CBS on April 13 and 14, 1977.\n\nHoward Hughes (Tommy Lee Jones), from early life, is portrayed as an eccentric perfectionist and later, a hypochondriac. He grew up as a wealthy but isolated individual who was able to indulge some of his obsessions. As a Hollywood producer, he was able to create some of the most iconic films of the era, including \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), \"Scarface\" (1932) and \"The Outlaw\" (1943, 1946). His passion as an aviator led to both designing as the head of the Hughes Aircraft Company, as well as flying top-secret aircraft he had built in record-breaking speed and endurance flights (Hughes H-1 Racer).\n\nAs well as pouring money into films and projects such as the huge H-4 Hercules aircraft), Hughes is also seen with many of the women in his life, including Jean Harlow, Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn (Tovah Feldshuh) and Jane Russell (Marla Carlis).\n\nOne incident in a 1946 involved a test flight of the XF-11, an experimental aircraft. The test flight culminated in a horrific crash, resulting in a concussion that left Hughes with brain damage and mental dysfunction, going into his old age and eventual death. His final years were spent as a recluse and while aboard a private flight to Mexico, Hughes died.\n\nIn 1971 Bob Thomas was contacted by director George Sidney, who had gotten to know the writer while the latter was researching \"King Cohn\", a biography of Harry Cohn. Sidney said Stanley Meyer, the financier, was looking for someone to help write Noah Dietrich's memoirs. Thomas met with Dietrich and wrote a book about Hughes. They struggled to find a publisher due to the fact Clifford Irving had released Hughes' diaries. When it was revealed the diaries were fake, the book found a publisher, Fawcett, the next day.\n\nFawcett released a million copies but only sold a third of them, which Thomas attributed to Irving's book. On the death of Hughes in 1976, numerous producers announced Hughes projects, including Warren Beatty and David Wolper, the latter based on Irving's book. Thomas' agents succeeded in selling the film rights to Thomas' book to Roger Gimbell who had a deal with EMI Television.\n\nThe project was originally developed by Roger Gimbell's production company.\n\nAt one stage Gimbel had negotiations with Warren Beatty to play Hughes. But when these broke down the producer decided to go \"180 degrees the other way\" and cast an unknown. He picked Tommy Lee Jones who had appeared in films such as \"Jackson County Jail\" and who Gimbel said \"matches the image the public has of Hughes\". \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" was a major break-through for Jones.\n\nFilming of \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" took eight weeks. During filming, Gimbel's company was bought out by EMI Television.\nA large group of aircraft were assembled for the production by Tallmantz Aviation. The aircraft included two Curtiss JN-4 biplanes, Learjet 23, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior, North American AT-6 Texan and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5.\n\nFilm historian Simon D. Beck in \"The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion\" (2016) described \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" as a \"... fascinating account of the life and times of eccentric millionaire, aviation pioneer and filmmaker ...\" Other reviews of \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" were, likewise, mainly positive. Part one was the fifth highest-rated show of the week; part two was the highest rated. It was seen by over 60 million people.\n\nUniversal agreed to distribute \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" theatrically outside the United States.\n\n\"The Amazing Howard Hughes\" was the original release of EMI Television, an off-shoot of EMI Films. \n\n\n"}

His last post was the manager of Ligue 1 side Marseille.\n\nAs the club manager of Bordeaux, Baup won the French Division 1 championships in 1999 and the Coupe de la Ligue in 2002. He was sacked on 24 October 2003 by the club president Jean-Louis Triaud.\n\nBaup signed on as the manager of Saint-Étienne in 2004, bringing to the club one of his favourite players, Pascal Feindouno. Saint-Étienne had won promotion to Ligue 1 at the end of the 2003–04 season. During Baup's tenure, the club finished sixth and thirteenth in the table respectively in the 2004–05 Ligue 1 and 2005–06 Ligue 1 seasons. He resigned from the club at the end of the 2005–06 season.\n\nIn his first season as the manager of the club, Baup guided Toulouse to finish third in the table in the 2006–07 Ligue 1 season. Toulouse thus earned a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, where it lost to Liverpool 5–0 on aggregate. With Toulouse finishing only 17th in the table in the 2007–08 Ligue 1 season and barely escaping relegation to Ligue 2, Baup was sacked on 30 May 2008, with one year left on his contract.\n\nBaup became the manager of Ligue 1 club Nantes on 28 August 2008. He resigned from the club on 2 June 2009, with over a year to run on his contract, after he had failed to save it from relegation to Ligue 2.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Baup worked as a football consultant in Canal Football Club, a program that shows highlights of Ligue 1 matches on Canal+.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, Baup signed a two-year contract with Marseille as its new manager, succeeding Didier Deschamps, who had left the club two days earlier to become the manager of France. On 2 August 2012, Baup oversaw his first competitive match as Marseille manager, a 1–1 away draw in the 2012–13 Europa League third qualifying round first leg against Turkish club Eskişehirspor. Seven days later, Marseille beat Eskişehirspor 3–0 in the return leg, winning the tie 4–1 on aggregate and thus secured a place in the 2012–13 Europa League play-off round. Marseille eventually qualified for the 2012–13 Europa League group stage, but did not progress from it to the knockout phase. On 12 August 2013, Baup's Marseille won its opening 2012–13 Ligue 1 match away against Reims with a 1–0 scoreline. The club would later achieve its best-ever start to a Ligue 1 or Division 1 season by winning its first six 2012–13 Ligue 1 matches. Marseille would eventually finish the 2012–13 Ligue 1 season in runner-up position, 12 points behind Paris Saint-Germain. Coincidentally, Marseille was defeated in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Coupe de France and 2012–13 Coupe de la Ligue by Paris Saint-Germain by the same scoreline of 2–0.\n\nIn the afternoon of 7 December 2013, the club announced on its website that Baup was no longer the Olympqiue de Marseille manager. The club president (Vincent Labrune) and Baup had earlier held a meeting right after the end of the training session conducted in the morning of 7 December 2013. \"The board feel that, after 17 league matches into the season, results have not corresponded with our objectives and a firm decision had to be taken to get the team moving in the right direction again in the coming weeks,\" read a statement on the club's official website. Vincent Labrune said that the decision to dismiss Baup was \"the most difficult and painful he had had to take since he came to the club\". \"Elie Baup is unanimously appreciated for his qualities as a person,\" Labrune added. \"Nobody can forget the job he has done at Olympique de Marseille. He enabled us to finish second last season when nobody expected us to.\" The decision to sack Baup came just a day after Marseille went down 1–0 to Nantes at the Stade Velodrome in a Ligue 1 match that left them in 5th position and 13 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain in the Ligue 1 table at the conclusion of the week 17 matches. Marseille had also fared poorly in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. They had so far failed to pick up a single point from their first five Group F matches against Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli, thus ensuring that they would finish at the bottom of the group.\n\nBordeaux\n\n"}

He emigrated with his parents in 1862 to Canada, and was educated in Sherbrooke, Quebec. After leaving Canada, he went to Massachusetts where he studied law at Harvard University. Rodey moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1881 where he became employed as a private secretary for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company. He left the railroad to practice law and was admitted to the bar in 1883. Active in politics from a young age, Bernard was elected to the territorial senate representing Bernalillo County in 1889. He introduced legislation to create the University of New Mexico. The bill detailed the acquisition of funds and land for the institution, locating its construction in New Albuquerque. Passage of the bill on February 28, 1889 earned Rodey the title \"Father of the University\" and Rodey Hall was named in his honor.\n\nIn 1900 Rodey was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Delegate from the New Mexico Territory. During his two terms in office, he was best known for his unrelenting fight to gain statehood not only for New Mexico, but Arizona and Oklahoma as well. He fought against a consortium of Eastern senators led by Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana that was threatened by the admission of Western territories as states. Rodey was defeated in a primary fight against William Henry Andrews in 1904.\n\nAfter his terms in Congress, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Rodey as federal judge for the United States District Court for Puerto Rico in 1906. Rodey's tenure on the bench was controversial and he became involved in the political dispute that culminated in adoption of the Olmsted Amendment and led some prominent Puerto Rican attorneys to unsuccessfully advocate for the abolition of the federal court in Puerto Rico or severely limit its jurisdiction. Rodey left the bench in 1910 and was succeeded by John J. Jenkins.\n\nAt the 1908 Republican National Convention, Rodey was one of several Republicans who convinced Taft to promise statehood for New Mexico and Arizona in his election campaign. Rodey was appointed by President William Taft as a federal government attorney in the Territory of Alaska, and then helped investigate a coal scandal in Alaska in 1913. He returned to Albuquerque to found the law firm of Rodey and Rodey, which ultimately grew into the present-day firm of Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb.\n\nAlthough President Warren Harding attempted to persuade Rodey back into politics, he never sought another public office. He died in Albuquerque in 1927 at the age of 71.\n"}

Out of a population of 5,000 people, 125 were killed, 1,121 were injured, and over 4,000 were left homeless. Five hundred and seven houses were destroyed, in addition to forty-four mobile homes and 30 businesses. The disaster destroyed or damaged homes in Saunders, Pardee, Lorado, Craneco, Lundale, Stowe, Crites, Latrobe, Robinette, Amherstdale, Becco, Fanco, Braeholm, Accoville, Crown and Kistler. In its legal filings, Pittston Coal referred to the accident as \"an Act of God.\"\n\nDam #3, constructed of coarse mining refuse dumped into the Middle Fork of Buffalo Creek starting in 1968, failed first, following heavy rains. The water from dam #3 then overwhelmed dams #2 and #1. Dam #3 had been built on top of coal slurry sediment that had collected behind dams # 1 and #2, instead of on solid bedrock. Dam #3 was approximately above the town of Saunders when it failed.\n\nTwo commissions investigated the disaster. The first, the Governor's Ad Hoc Commission of Inquiry, appointed by Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr., was made up entirely of either members sympathetic to the coal industry or government officials whose departments might have been complicit in the genesis of the flood. One of the investigators was Jack Spadaro, a man who devoted his time to regulating dam construction for safety. After then-president of the United Mine Workers Arnold Miller and others were rebuffed by Gov. Moore regarding their request that a coal miner be added to the governor's commission, a separate citizen's commission was assembled to provide an independent review of the disaster.\n\nThe Governor's Commission of Inquiry report called for new legislation and further inquiry by the local prosecutor. The citizen's commission report, concluded that the Buffalo Creek-Pittston Coal Company was guilty of murdering at least 124 men, women and children. Additionally, the chair of the citizen's commission and Deputy Director of the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources, Norman Williams, called for the legislature to outlaw coal strip mining throughout the state. Williams testified before the legislature that strip mining could not exist as a profit-making industry unless it is allowed by the state to pass on the costs of environmental damage to the private landowner or the public.\n\nThe state of West Virginia also sued the Buffalo Creek-Pittston Coal Company for $100 million (equivalent to $ million today) in disaster and relief damages, but a smaller settlement was reached for just $1 million ($ million today) with Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. three days before he left office in 1977. The lawyers for the plaintiffs, Arnold & Porter of Washington, D.C., donated a portion of their legal fees for the construction of a new community center. West Virginia has yet to build the center, though the center was promised by Governor Moore in May 1972. \n\nGerald M. Stern, an attorney with Arnold & Porter, wrote a book entitled \"The Buffalo Creek Disaster\" about representing the victims of the flood. The book includes descriptions of his experiences dealing with the political and legal environment of West Virginia, where the influence of large coal mining corporations is intensely significant to the local culture and communities. Sociologist Kai T. Erikson, son of psychologist and sociologist Erik Erikson, was called as an expert witness and published a study on the effects of the disaster entitled \"Everything In Its Path: Destruction of Community in the Buffalo Creek Flood\" (1978). Erikson's book later won the 1977 Sorokin Award, granted by the American Sociological Association for an \"outstanding contribution to the progress of sociology.\"\n\nSimpson-Housley and De Man (1989) found that, 17 years later, the residents of Buffalo Creek scored higher on a measure of trait anxiety in comparison to the residents of Kopperston, a nearby coal town that did not experience the flood. \n\nDennis Prince and some 625 survivors of the flood sued the Pittston Coal Company, seeking $64 million in damages (equivalent to $ million today). They settled in June 1974 for $13.5 million ($ million today), or approximately $13,000 for each individual after legal costs ($ today). A second suit was filed by 348 child survivors, who sought $225 million ($ billion today); they settled for $4.8 million in June 1974 ($ million today). \n\nKerry Albright became known as the \"miracle baby\" of the disaster. Running from the leading edge of the water, his mother threw him just above the flood level moments before she drowned. He survived with few ill effects, and was reared by his father. His survival gave hope and inspiration to other survivors.\n\n\n\n"}

They begot him long after their marriage. When they took him for baptism, the bishop who baptized him saw a cross of light over his head. The bishop laid the boy's hand over his head and prophesied concerning him saying, \"The church of God will be entrusted to him.\" Then he told his parents, \"Take care of him, for he is a chosen vessel of God.\"\n\nWhen he grew they taught him writing, the Christian doctrine and church subjects. He read extensively in the biography of saints and he was filled with their pure life. He longed for the monastic life, so he left his parents and went to the desert of St. Macarius. He became a monk and disciple of Anba Zacharias, the Hegumen. The angel of the Lord had informed the elder father beforehand of his coming and the father received him with joy. One day, one of the holy elders saw him in the church and prophesied about him saying, \"The church of Christ will be entrusted to him.\"\n\nPope John, the Patriarch of that time, asked for a monk to be his scribe and private secretary. The people who were present recommended this honorable Father Isaac. The Pope had Father Isaac brought to him. He gave him a book to scribe. Anba Isaac made mistakes in his writing deliberately, hoping that the Pope might send him back, for he had forsaken the glory of men. When the father knew his intention he said to him, \"You have written well, do not leave this place.\"\n\nWhen Father Isaac realized that the Patriarch would not let him return, he used all his knowledge and writing ability and his virtues became known. The Patriarch rejoiced in him exceedingly. Nevertheless, because Father Isaac was still longing for solitary life, the Patriarch allowed him to return to the desert.\n\nWhen the death of Pope John drew near, he asked the Lord Christ to let it be known to him who would be his successor. In a vision, he was told that his disciple Isaac would sit on the chair after him. The Pope commanded the people that, with a divine revelation and by the order of the Lord, Isaac would sit on the chair after him.\n\nWhen this father was enthroned to the See of St. Mark, the church was illumined. He restored many churches, especially the church of St. Mark the Evangelist, and the patriarchal cell. He suffered many tribulations and sat upon the throne for three and a half years, then departed in peace.\n"}

It is named after Saint Ann.\n\nDuring the persecution of Catholics in Hawaii (circa 1849), many natives fled from Honolulu over the Pali trail to the windward side and settled in the Koolau area. Father Robert Walsh, SS.CC (the same community as that of Father Damien of Molokai) began ministering to the Catholics. In 1841, Father Robert Martial Janvier, SS.CC. replaced Fr. Walsh and centered the mission in the Heeia area.\n\nParish tradition has it that a village chief had gone to a Protestant Missionary asking for lamp oil. The missionary could not give him any oil. The chief then went to the Catholic mission (at that time located at Mokapu Point) and received his oil. In gratitude, the chief gave the missionaries a piece of property.\n\nFrom the Church's very beginning in 1841, the missionaries established classes for the children in the district. At first, these classes were instructions about the Catholic faith; very quickly they included reading, writing, arithmetic, and a little geography.\n\nIn 1871, a boarding school was established for eight boys by Fr. Mattias Limburg, SS.CC. The following year, 1872, a regular day school was started for boys and girls.\n\nThe McCabe family was instrumental in running the school until the arrival of the Maryknoll Sisters in 1927.\n\nIn 1960, St. Ann's School extended its curriculum to include a high school. The high school closed in 1969.\n\nIn 1988, the administration of St. Ann's School saw the need to provide quality child care coupled with an opportunity to prepare younger children for our own kindergarten.

He is the son of former wrestling world champion Ric Flair and the older half brother of Charlotte Flair and Reid Flair.\n\nGrowing up, Fliehr never wanted to become a wrestler; he always wanted to be a state trooper. He appeared on camera \nbackstage with his father at Starrcade 1993 in World Championship Wrestling. In the storyline, his father was going to have to \"retire\" if he lost his match, so his family appeared to increase the emotion. In late 1998, David was back on WCW TV sitting front row and getting involved in some skirmishes with Eric Bischoff and the nWo.\n\nHe eventually decided to become a wrestler and teamed with his father in his debut match at WCW/nWo Souled Out on January 17, 1999. Fliehr wrestled under his father's altered surname of \"Flair\". They wrestled Curt Hennig and Barry Windham and won the match. After the match, the entire nWo came out, and Hollywood Hogan lashed David with his belt until David's back (and stomach where the belt whipped around and struck) was full of welts while his father was handcuffed to the ring ropes. In his autobiography, Ric Flair alleges that Hogan took liberties with his son by whipping him far more times than agreed upon and that he would never forgive Hogan for this. To his credit, David took the punishment without complaint; both in the ring and backstage.\n\nOn February 21 at SuperBrawl IX, David turned on his father and joined the nWo Wolfpac. He used a taser on his father to help Hogan win their WCW World Title match. He did not wrestle for a while but did appear in vignettes with Samantha (Torrie Wilson) while he was training at the WCW Power Plant.\n\nFlair started to wrestle a regular schedule in May 1999. He made up with his father who then had the Four Horsemen help Flair win matches. Ric, being the on-screen WCW President, stripped WCW United States Champion Scott Steiner of his title and awarded it to Flair. On July 11, Flair defeated Dean Malenko, with the help of Ric and Arn Anderson, to keep the title in his first defense on pay-per-view.\n\nIn August, Ric had real-life problems with Eric Bischoff backstage and was removed from television. Flair was left on his own and lost his US Title to Chris Benoit on August 9. During a storyline in September, Wilson left Flair for Billy Kidman. Ric and Anderson returned to TV and tried to help David. In October, Diamond Dallas Page and his wife Kimberly started a feud with the Flairs. Kimberly kept Flair distracted while Page, in storyline, injured Ric. In response, Flair went insane after seeing his injured father. Flair injured Page in the WCW World Title Tournament that was being held on \"WCW Monday Nitro\". He used the crowbar and only stopped when Kimberly got in between him and her husband. This led to a storyline where Flair stalked Kimberly. She got one of her husband's teammates Bam Bam Bigelow to help her, but Flair used the crowbar on him too. Vince Russo finally scheduled a match between Flair and Kimberly for Mayhem on November 21. Kimberly tried to seduce Flair and then \"hit him low\", but he had a cup on. Page and his friend Chris Kanyon came to her rescue and laid Flair out. Anderson arrived again but got laid out by Flair, who ran off into the fans.\n\nFlair was joined by Daffney at Starrcade in 1999. He was joined a little later by Crowbar. They formed a team and won the vacant WCW World Tag Team Titles in a tournament final on January 3, 2000 over Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner with Anderson as the special referee. They lost the titles to Big Vito and Johnny the Bull, \"The Mamalukes,\" on January 19. Flair soon split with Crowbar and in May 2000, joined Vince Russo's New Blood. He dumped Daffney and took Miss Hancock (Stacy Keibler) as his valet. He also turned on his father again which led to a match against him at The Great American Bash. Flair lost, but the next night, he won a match against his father to retire him and shave his father's head.\n\nNear the end of 2000, Flair and Keibler were going to have an on-air wedding as part of a new storyline. Before that could happen though, it was revealed that Stacy was pregnant and that David was not the father. This led to Flair trying to figure out who the father was with the help of Ric, whom he had made up with, and Anderson. He even had a match with Buff Bagwell to get Bagwell's DNA. This storyline ended abruptly when Miss Hancock returned to television with Shawn \"The Star\" Stasiak and a baby carriage in the ring. Instead of a baby, however, it was revealed that there were 8x10 pictures of Shawn in the carriage. After this angle, Flair was no longer seen in WCW as a competitor.\n\nOn the February 12, 2001 edition of \"Nitro\", as on-screen CEO Ric Flair and the Magnificent Seven were trying to discuss things inside the ring, Kevin Nash appeared on the Turnertron and told Ric that he has his son David in his locker room. Nash told Ric that his number one priority was to become the number one contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was held by Scott Steiner. His number two priority was getting a rematch for Dustin Rhodes against Rick Steiner, who was WCW U.S. Champion at the time. Nash felt like Ric had wronged Rhodes, and he felt Rhodes could beat Steiner in a rematch. Out of concern for his son's safety, Ric granted all of Nash's requests. Nash would get his title shot against Scott Steiner for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship later that night, and Rhodes would get his rematch against Rick Steiner. Later that night, Nash came to the ring with Ric's son David. As they started coming to the ring, Nash gave a punch to David. Ric Flair and WCW security came out as Ric begged Nash to stop assaulting his son. Nash did not listen and gave David a Jackknife Powerbomb. Ric and WCW security came to the ring to pull David out as Scott Steiner was coming down to the ring alongside Midajah.\n\nFlair toured in the independent circuit for the first part of 2001. He teamed with Don Factor to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship on March 21. They lost them on March 23. He then teamed with Romeo Bliss to win the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship on March 24. They lost them on April 21.\n\nIn May 2001, the WWF picked up Flair's WCW contract and sent him to Ohio Valley Wrestling. He stayed there and feuded with Val Venis and had a brief tag team with Mark Jindrak until late 2002, when they dropped his development contract. He did make two appearances on WWF TV during 2002 as he was beaten up by The Undertaker on March 4 and wrestled the Undertaker on March 14 as part of the build-up for his father's match against Undertaker at WrestleMania X8.\n\nFlair joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in December 2002. He joined Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) group. He had a brief feud with Curt Hennig and then left S.E.X. to form Next Generation with Brian Lawler and Erik Watts. Together, they feuded with Dusty Rhodes and mocked him with an old NWA World Title belt. David left TNA in early 2003.\n\nAfter TNA, David toured the independent circuit, winning the IWA Intercontinental Title from Ray Gonzalez on November 28, 2003 in Puerto Rico. He lost it to Gonzalez two days later. Flair quit IWA after problems with IWA promoter Víctor Quiñones.\n\nOn December 6, 2008, he wrestled a match with his half-brother, Reid, who was making his professional wrestling debut, defeating The Nasty Boys via submission in Charlotte, North Carolina, with Hulk Hogan as the special guest referee.\n\nFlair dated Stacy Keibler in 2000, when they both worked in WCW. Flair married Robin Haskell in 2004, and they reside in Shelby, North Carolina. The Fliehrs are third-generation owners of the Seal Wire Company, started by Robin's grandparents in 1956. He works in law enforcement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805658", "title": "Halohydrin dehalogenase", "text": "Halohydrin dehalogenase\n\nA halohydrin dehalogenase is an enzyme involved in the bacterial degradation of vicinal halohydrins. In several species of bacteria, it catalyses the dehalogenation of halohydrins to produce the corresponding epoxides. Different isoforms of the enzyme fall into one of three groups, A, B or C. Halogenases of the same class are genetically similar, but differ greatly from halogenases from a different group. Currently the most well-studied isoform is HheC which is purified from the bacterial species \"Agrobacterium radiobacter\". The ability to dehalogenate organic compounds as well as form enantiomeric selective epoxides have generated interest in the potential of this enzyme in the biochemical field.\n\nCurrently of three known classes of halohydrin dehalogenases, only two have been described by x-ray crystallography studies. However, both of these classes have similar structure which can be described as follows(1): a halohydrin dehalogenase is structured as a tetramer with a symmetry characteristic of a dimer of dimers. Each monomeric subunit consists of seven alpha helices and nine beta-sheets. These monomers interact via the two longest alpha helices to form an alpha-helical bundle to form a dimer. The final quaternary structure is formed when two dimers interact via a different set of alpha helices and anti-parallel beta-sheets; interactions between the beta-sheets are thought to be a combination of both hydrophobic and electrostatic attraction.\n\nThere is approximately one catalytic site per monomer subunit giving a total of four possible catalytic sites on the enzymatic tetramer. The active site consists of a Ser132-Tyr145-Arg149 catalytic triad. The serine and tyrosine residues function to stabilize the substrate and its intermediate, while the arginine alters the pKa of Tyr145 to make it catalytically active.\n\nHalohydrin dehalogenases mechanistically cleaves the carbon-halogen bond through the formation of an epoxide from a vicinal hydroxyl group. The substrate binds to the active site through hydrogen bonding that is coordinated by Ser132 and the deprotonated form of Tyr145. Failure to deprotonate Tyr145 by the Arg149 residue results in destabilization of the interaction between the enzyme and substrate resulting in reduced biological activity. The oxygen in Tyr145 deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the substrate. The deprotonated oxygen then acts as a nucleophile and performs a Sn2 reaction on the vicinal carbon that is bonded to the halogen; this releases a halogen ion and simultaneously forms an epoxide. Dehalogenases are also able to catalyze the ring-opening of the epoxide. The active site is large enough to accommodate a nucleophile which can perform a nucleophilic attack on the epoxide, opening the epoxide ring and adding a new functional group to the substrate.\n\nIn regards to the geometry of the product, both class A and B dehalogenases have a low selective preference for the (S)-epoxide isomer. However, the preference for the formation of the (R)-epoxide isomer catalyzed by enzymes in class C, particularly HHeC, is high. One study reports that HHeC catalyzed (R)-epoxide up to 99% enantiomeric excess. However, the technology to purify this enzyme and utilize it on an industrial scale has yet to remain optimized.\n"}

Since 2019, he is a member of the European Parliament.\n\nGarcía-Margallo was born in Madrid. In 1960, he joined the Young Spanish Monarchists. He graduated in Law and Economics from the University of Deusto in Bilbao (1965) and subsequently received a master's degree in law (LLM) from Harvard University (1972). His great-grandfather was General Juan García y Margallo, who was killed in 1893 during the First Melillan campaign, otherwise known as the Margallo War.\n\nIn 1976, Margallo was one of the founding members of the center-right People's Party (Partido Popular), a party unrelated to the current party of the same name. In 1977, that party joined others in forming the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), a coalition which won the first democratic elections of the modern era in Spain and formed the government from 1977 to 1982. At the 1977 election, he was elected to the Congress of Deputies as member for the single member district of Melilla and was re-elected in 1979, although he lost his seat at the 1982 election to the PSOE.\n\nAfter the UCD disbanded in 1983, Margallo joined the Democratic Popular Party (PDP) and returned to the Congress at the 1986 election in representation of Valencia, retaining his seat until 1994 when he resigned after being elected to the European Parliament.\n\nThroughout his time in the European Parliament, Margallo served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy; between 2002 and 2011, he was the committee's vice-chairman. In this capacity, he led the Parliament's work on the European Banking Authority (EBA). He also called for the creation of a European Financial Protection Fund that would bail out large banks in times of crisis and would be financed primarily by contributions from banks themselves.\n\nMargallo also served on the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis between 2009 and 2011 as well as on the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 between 2010 and 2011. In addition to his committee assignments, he was a member of the parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of Central America.\n\nMargallo led the EU-Election Observer Mission for the 2010 presidential election in Togo.\n\nOn 22 December 2011, Margallo was inaugurated as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in the first cabinet presided by Mariano Rajoy.\n\nIn March 2012, Margallo announced that, in response to savage killings and human rights abuses in Syria, his country would cease activities at its embassy in Damascus, but would not formally close its mission.\n\nIn November 2012, Margallo announced that Spain would follow France in announcing it will support a bid of the Palestinian National Authority for enhanced status at the United Nations when the issue goes to a vote of the General Assembly.\n\nIn 2014, amid negotiations towards an accord with the European Union aimed at opening up Cuba, Margallo irritated Raúl Castro's government with his call for Cuba to grant free travel rights to dissidents arrested in the Black Spring of 2003 and later released under strict conditions. During a visit to the country, Margallo was denied an audience with Castro and instead met with First Vice-President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n\nFollowing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the nuclear program of Iran in 2015, Margallo led a high-level government and business delegation to Iran, joining other countries drawn to Tehran by the possibility of lucrative opportunities that could be unlocked by a nuclear deal. A day after sanctions against Iran were lifted in January 2016, Margallo entered into negotiations with the Iranian government over the construction of an Iranian-owned oil refinery at the Gibraltar strait.\n\nAlmost 50 years after coming close to possibly provoking a nuclear disaster, Margallo and his counterpart John Kerry of the United States agreed in 2015 to remove contaminated soil from an area in southern Spain where an American warplane accidentally dropped hydrogen bombs. The deal, announced on a visit by Kerry to Spain, followed years of wrangling between the two countries over how to clean up the area around the seaside village of Palomares, over which the accident took place in 1966.\n\nMargallo did not continue at the post of Foreign minister after the formation of the Second Rajoy Government in 2016. Margallo has later blamed his exit from the Council of Ministers to alleged machinations by Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría. He would remain nonetheless as member of the Congress of Deputies for the rest of its 12th term. Following the resignation of Rajoy to the leadership of the PP and the ensuing celebration of a leadership election in July 2018, Margallo contested the latter facing his \"bête noire\" Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, in addition to another 4 candidates. Margallo commanded only 688 votes from among the party members. As only Sáenz de Santamaría and Pablo Casado passed to the second round, to be voted by party delegates, Margallo endorsed Casado.\n\nMargallo was included 7th in the PP list for the 2019 European election. Elected, he became a Member of the European Parliament again, after his 1994–2011 spell. In addition to his committee assignments, he is part of the European Parliament Intergroup on Seas, Rivers, Islands and Coastal Areas.\n\n\nOften seen as a controversial figure, Margallo has often been critical of Gibraltar. In February 2015 he ordered the closure of the Instituto Cervantes in Gibraltar stating that there was no need for Spanish classes in Gibraltar as 'everyone speaks (Spanish) except for the apes'.\n\nIn June 2016 Margallo said Spain would demand control of Gibraltar the \"very next day\" after a British withdrawal from the EU. Under Margallo's leadership, the Foreign Ministry on 11 July 2016 summoned Britain's ambassador following what it said were \"reckless\" moves by a Royal Gibraltar Police patrol boat.\n\n"}

Her most recent work examines the sociomaterial practices entailed in social media.\n\nStructurational studies of technology and organizations have been highly influenced by the social studies of technology. Initially arguing for a view of the \"duality of technology,\" Orlikowski went on to argue for a practice-based understanding of the recursive interaction between people and technologies over time. Orlikowski (2000) argues that emergent structures offer a more generative view of technology use, suggesting that users do not so much appropriate technologies as they enact particular technologies-in-practice with them. The ongoing enactment of technologies-in-practice either reproduce existing structural conditions or they produce changes that may lead to structural transformation.\n\nBased on a series of empirical studies of collaborative technologies (groupware), Orlikowski identified at least three types of enactment produced within different conditions and producing different consequences associated with humans engagement with technology in practice. \n\nIn more recent work, Orlikowski argues that our primary ways of dealing with materiality in organizational research are conceptually problematic and proposes an alternative approach that posits materiality as constitutive of everyday life. This work draws on Karen Barad's agential realism and the notion of sociomateriality as influenced by the work of Lucy Suchman and Annemarie Mol.\n\nIn co-authored work, Orlikowski and Susan Scott of the London School of Economics argue for a focus on sociomaterial practices within organizational and information system studies. This recognizes that all practices are always and everywhere sociomaterial, and that this sociomateriality is constitutive of the contours and possibilities of everyday organizing.\n\nOrlikowski won the Lasting Impact Award from the ACM CSCW conference in 2015 for her paper \"Learning from Notes: organizational issues in groupware implementation\".\n\n\n"}

It received a federal charter in 1936 and changed its name to Twin City Federal Savings and Loan Association. The company went public in 1986 chartered under the name TCF Banking and Savings, F.A. (TCF Bank). Despite some bank acquisitions such as Great Lakes Bancorp and Standard Financial, TCF Bank has grown primarily through \"de novo\" expansion.\n\nOn January 28, 2019, Chemical Bank of Detroit announced it would merge with TCF. The new corporation will retain the TCF name, but be headquartered in the tower Chemical is constructing in Detroit. It will maintain large operating centers in Minneapolis and Midland, Michigan.\n\nTCF Bank was founded in Minneapolis. With approximately 110 branches in the area, it continues to be a major force in the Twin Cities. In-store branches are located inside of Cub Foods stores.

From 1995 through 1998, the TCF Bank branches in Michigan operated under the Great Lakes National Bank name. In 1999, all of the branches were reflagged as TCF.\n\nIn 2002, the University of Michigan announced that TCF Bank had been selected as a preferred provider of banking services to students, faculty, and staff. The University terminated this agreement in 2015.\n\nIn 2005, TCF Bank announced the sale of its Michigan headquarters building to Ann Arbor real-estate company McKinley Associates, though part of the ground level remains a TCF Bank branch.\n\nOn November 6, 2006, TCF announced the sale of 10 branches in Battle Creek, Bay City, and Saginaw to Independent Bank.

Some practices that came to light included processing higher amount transactions first in order to drain customer accounts faster, allowing TCF to then increase the number of total overdraft charges from each of the smaller amounts remaining, as well as charging overdraft fees on a daily basis rather than posing one flat fee. In 2011, TCF Bank changed its overdraft policy to include a daily $28 fee. After public backlash, the bank reversed its policy in 2012.\n\nIn January 2013, the Comptroller of the Currency assessed a $10 million fine on TCF for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. This was a result of the bank's failure to file suspicious activity reports in a timely fashion.\n\nOn January 21st, 2020, an assistant manager at a TCF branch on Middlebelt Road Livonia, Michigan, called police on Sauntore Thomas, an African-American account holder who was trying to deposit checks received as a settlement in a racial discrimination lawsuit. The branch manager claimed the checks were fraudulent. TCF also filed a police report for fraud against the customer despite verification from his attorney that the checks were genuine. Thomas launched his suit on January 22, 2020 seeking unspecified damages. On January 23rd, 2020 TCF issued an apology and defended their employee's response to call police and file a fraud report.\n\nOn March 24, 2005, TCF Bank and the University of Minnesota announced that the bank would contribute $35 million during a 25-year period toward a proposed on-campus outdoor football stadium, in exchange for naming rights.

The vicinal adjective is sometimes restricted to those molecules with two \"identical\" functional groups. The term can also be extended to substituents on aromatic rings.\n\nIn H NMR spectroscopy, the coupling of two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms is called vicinal coupling.

The original correspondents were Jane Wallace, Bob Sirott, Meredith Vieira and John Ferrugia. Later contributors included Steve Kroft, Selina Scott, Karen Burnes and Stephen Schiff.\n\nThe program's popularity, a concern for \"60 Minutes\" creator Don Hewitt, prompted pundit Andy Rooney to dedicate one of the closing segments on his program to a parody of \"West 57th\" correspondents.

It was, until the extension of Autoroute 25 was opened in 2011, the only constructed north-south autoroute to go out of Montreal on both sides. A-15 begins at the end of Interstate 87 at the United States border at Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle and extends via Montreal to Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts with an eventual continuation beyond Mont-Tremblant. The total length of A-15 is currently , including a short concurrency () with Autoroute 40 (Boulevard/Autoroute Métropolitan) that connects the two main sections. This is one of the few autoroutes in Quebec that does not have any spinoff highways.\n\nThe southern section of A-15 connects the south shore suburbs of Montreal and is also the primary trade corridor route between Montreal and New York City linking Quebec Autoroute 15 to Interstate 87 at the Canada-United States border at the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing. This was the former Route 9, and connected with US 9 on the western shore of Lake Champlain. In Brossard, it joins up with A-10 and A-20 across the Champlain Bridge into Montreal. The A-10 splits off almost immediately after crossing the bridge to head into downtown Montreal at the Bonaventure Expressway and the A-20 splits off shortly after at the Turcot Interchange (\"échangeur Turcot\"), leaving the A-15 to continue northward as Autoroute Décarie until the Décarie Interchange (\"échangeur Décarie\") with the A-40 at the point where it turns from the Trans-Canada into the Metropolitan Expressway.\n\nThe route is also connected to Autoroute 30 in Candiac which was completed to Autoroute 20 in 2012 providing a quicker access to the south shore of Montreal, to southern communities located alongside Autoroute 15 and to the Canada–US border in Lacolle. It will also give a quicker access from there to areas west of Montreal and also Ottawa and Gatineau.\n\nThe Décarie Autoroute is a sunken highway between the northbound and southbound lanes of Decarie Boulevard from the Metropolitan Autoroute at its northern end to Monkland Avenue and the Villa Maria Metro station at its southern end. It was built on a wide expanse of vacant land, donated to the city by the Décarie estate on the condition that a streetcar line would be established. The decommissioning of the streetcar system in 1959 left the right-of-way as an obvious choice for a highway and so the Décarie Autoroute was dug there. South of Queen Mary Road, however, were a significant number of houses that were demolished.\n\nTo avoid demolishing Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Church, the highway makes a slight westerly jog below Côte-Saint-Luc Road and runs through a short tunnel, before emerging between Addington and Botrel Streets and running down to Sherbrooke Street and Saint Jacques Street, where it spectacularly goes from being below the ground to well above the ground as it intersects with Autoroutes 20 and 720 in the infamous Turcot Interchange (dubbed \"Spaghetti Junction\" by train crews operating the former CN Rail Turcot Yard). Following the conversion from streetcar line to highway, the Décarie estate sued the city but was unable to prevail because its did not document its case well enough for the nevertheless-sympathetic court.\n\nDecarie Boulevard itself continues; from Monkland Avenue south to Saint Jacques Street past the McGill University Health Centre Glen Campus superhospital; and from Autoroute 40 north into Ville Saint-Laurent past Du College Station and Côte-Vertu Station/Norgate shopping centre to Poirier Street. Between Monkland Avenue and A 40, Decarie Boulevard serves as sort of a service road on both sides of the autoroute.\n\nAfter its concurrency with A-40, the northern section of A-15 is the main freeway route to the Laurentians, or Laurentides, until it downgrades to Route 117. It also links up to the northern suburbs of Montreal, as well as provides a connection to the A-440, A-640 and the A-50 in Mirabel. The first section from A-40 to Saint-Jérôme was opened in 1958 as a toll road, although the tolls were removed in 1985. This section was also the first to be designed as an autoroute in the province. It was named Autoroute Montréal-Laurentides during the 1960s.\n\nOver the next years, it was extended north to Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts as a new connection to touristic and skiing destinations in the Laurentides including in Saint-Sauveur, Sainte-Adèle, Mont-Gabriel and Estérel. In the future, it is possible that the A-15 may continue even farther north, past Mont-Tremblant, as Route 117 is already an at-grade expressway with a freeway bypass of Saint-Jovite completed, and the name \"Autoroute des Laurentides\" is also recognized on the freeway bypass (and exit numbers continue). This section is numbered separately from the southern section as if it were a different route. The northern route is also part of the Trans-Canada Highway.\nExit numbering resets at the two interchanges with Autoroute 40 in Montréal.\n\nOn June 18, 2000, the southern portion of the Boulevard du Souvenir overpass in Laval (which crosses over Quebec Autoroute 15), under reconstruction, collapsed into the roadway, killing one and injuring two when cars were crushed underneath the structure. Sixteen beams weighing about each fell. The contractor was faulted for shoddy work. The arched concrete beams were unsecured and tipped over like dominoes, many of them breaking into pieces.\n\nThe expressway has also seen flooding. On July 14, 1987, a sudden torrential downpour caused by an HP supercell thunderstorm dumped over of rain in just over one hour across the city. The Décarie Expressway, which is below-grade, was heavily flooded and became a river. At some locations, the water reached a maximum of in depth on the roadway. Over 300 vehicles were abandoned when they were submerged. Two people were killed by the storm. One 80-year-old man on the Expressway drowned and another one was killed by electrical wires (electrocuted). On July 5, 2005, another torrential downpour flooded portions of the Expressway after several manhole covers blew open from the storm sewers below them being overloaded.\n\n\n"}

Since then, many territories around the world have been under the control of the United Kingdom or its predecessor states\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707 by the union of the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England, the latter country's colonial possessions passed to the new state. Similarly, when Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland in 1801 to form the United Kingdom, control over its colonial possessions passed to the latter state. Collectively, these territories are referred to as the British Empire. Upon much of Ireland gaining independence in 1922 as the Irish Free State, the other territories of the Empire remained under the control of the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom 1714 to 1837 the British throne was held by a series of kings who were also the rulers of the German state of Hanover. However, this was purely a personal union, with Hanover maintaining its political independence otherwise, and so it is not usually considered to have formed part of the British Empire.\n\nThe nature of the territories (and peoples) ruled as part of the British Empire varied enormously. In legal terms the territories included those formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch (who held the additional title of Emperor (or Empress) of India from 1876 to 1947); various \"foreign\" territories controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the League of Nations or the United Nations; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, a condominium with Egypt. No uniform system of government was applied to any of these.\n\nA number of countries (dominions) within the British Empire gained independence in stages during the earlier part of the 20th century. Much of the rest of the Empire was dismantled in the twenty years following the end of the Second World War, starting with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, and continued until the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997. There remain, however, 14 global territories which remain under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. \n\nMany of the former territories of the British Empire are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Fifteen of these (known, with the United Kingdom, as the 16 Commonwealth realms) retain the British monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) as Head of State. The British monarch is also Head of the Commonwealth, but this is a purely symbolic and personal title; members of the Commonwealth (including the Commonwealth realms) are fully sovereign states.\n\nThe British Empire refers to the possessions, dominions and dependencies under the control of the Crown. In addition to the areas formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch, various \"foreign\" territories were controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the League of Nations or the United Nations; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the condominium of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The natures of the administration of the Empire changed both by time and place, and there was no uniform system of government in the Empire.\n\nColonies were territories that were intended to be places of permanent settlement, providing land for their settlers. The Crown claimed absolute sovereignty over them, although they were not formally part of the United Kingdom itself. Generally their law was the common law of England together with whatever British Acts of Parliament were also applied to them. Over time, a number of colonies were granted \"responsible government\", making them largely self-governing.\n\nA Crown colony was a type of colonial administration of the English and later the British Empire, whose legislature and administration were controlled by the Crown.\nCrown colonies were ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch. By the middle of the 19th century, the sovereign appointed royal governors on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This became the main method of creating and governing colonies. Most Crown colonies, especially the white settler colonies had a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house usually called the Legislative council, which members were appointed and served a similar purpose as the British House of Lords. There also existed lower houses which were usually named the Legislative Assembly or House of Assembly. The lower house was usually elected, but suffrage was restricted to free white men only, usually with property ownership restrictions. Since land ownership was widespread, most white men could vote. The governor also often had an Executive Council which had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the colonial lower house. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the lower house but were usually members of the upper house. Later as the white colonies gained more internal responsible government, the lower house began to supersede the (usually unelected) upper house as the colonial legislature, and the position of Premier emerged.\n\nCharter colony is one of the three classes of colonial government established in the 17th-century English colonies in North America. In a charter colony, the King granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed and charter colonies elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.\n\nA number of colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries were granted to a particular individual; these were known as proprietary colonies. Proprietary colonies in America were governed by a Lord Proprietor, who, holding authority by virtue of a royal charter, usually exercised that authority almost as an independent sovereign. Eventually these were converted to Crown colonies.\n\nA chartered company is an association formed by investors or shareholders for the purpose of trade, exploration and colonisation. Chartered companies were usually formed, incorporated and legitimised under a royal charter. This document set out the terms under which the company could trade, defined its boundaries of influence, and described its rights and responsibilities. Groups of investors formed companies to underwrite and profit from the exploration of Africa, India, Asia, the Caribbean and North America, under the patronage of the state. Some companies such as the East India Company ruled large colonial possessions (especially in India).\n\nA protectorate is a territory which is not formally annexed but in which, by treaty, grant or other lawful means, the Crown has power and jurisdiction. A protectorate differs from a \"protected state\". A protected state is a territory under a foreign ruler which enjoys British protection, over whose foreign affairs she exercises control, but in respect of whose internal affairs she does not exercise jurisdiction.\n\nDominions were semi-independent polities that were nominally under the Crown, constituting the British Empire and British Commonwealth, beginning in the later part of the 19th century. The dominions had been previously Crown colonies, and some of the colonies had been united to form dominions such as Union of South Africa and Commonwealth of Australia. Dominion status was formally defined in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which recognised these countries as \"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom; the Statute of Westminster 1931 converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the British Commonwealth. Initially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous armed forces, although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the Statute of Westminster the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as \"the Crown\". Arthur Berriedale Keith, in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918–1931, stated that \"the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law\". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as \"Dominions\" became Commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the United Kingdom and one another.\nMandates were forms of territory created after the end of the First World War. A number of German colonies and protectorates and Ottoman provinces were held as mandates by the United Kingdom (Tanganyika, British Cameroons, Togoland, Palestine and Mesopotamia); and its dominions of Australia (New Guinea, Nauru), New Zealand (Western Samoa), and South Africa (South West Africa). In theory these territories were governed on behalf of the League of Nations for the benefit of their inhabitants. Most converted to United Nations Trust Territories in 1946.\n\nThe British Raj, also called the Indian Empire, was the imperial political structure in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947, comprising British India (a Crown colony: presidencies and provinces directly governed by the British Crown through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India) and Princely States, governed by Indian rulers, under the suzerainty of the British Crown exercised through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.\n\nWithin twenty years of the partition and independence in 1947 of British India (considered to be the most important colonial possession), most of the Empire's territories had achieved full independence. Today 14 former colonies (since 2002 known as British Overseas Territories) remain under British rule; the term \"colonies\" is no longer officially used to describe these.\n\nAlmost all of the British Overseas Territories are islands (or groups of islands) with a small population; some are in very remote areas of the world. Of the territories with a permanent population, all have at least some degree of internal self-government, with the United Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and external relations.\nThe fourteen British Overseas Territories are:\n\nThe three Crown dependencies are:\n\nThis is a listing of the more important treaties, Acts of Parliament, and other legal instruments and events affecting the nature and territorial extent of the British Empire.\n\n\n"}

Only 6 or 7 examples were built.\n\nPower came from a large 5.0 L (5027 cc/306 in³) straight-4 engine with 3 valves per cylinder and a single overhead camshaft.

Again, in spite of the size of that engine it does not give the impression of a big car and in spite of the tall radiator the short wheelbase lends it the appearance of a small sports car. On the road that impression is reinforced, the delicacy of control makes it a joy to drive and one can still flick the gearlever about as you may do only in an early Bugatti.\n\nThe subdued howl and occasional suggestion of snatch from the side chains remind that this is a period car.

Among the best known examples are the post-mortem explosion of whales, either as a result of natural decomposition or deliberate attempts at carcass disposal. Other instances of exploding animals are defensive in nature or the result of human intervention.\n\nNatural explosions can occur for a variety of reasons. Post-mortem explosions, like that of a beached whale, are the result of the build-up of natural gases created by methane-producing bacteria inside the carcass during the decomposition process. Natural explosions which occur while an animal is living may be defense-related. A number of toads in Germany and Denmark exploded in April 2005. The \"Los Angeles Herald\" in 1910 reported a duck which exploded after consuming yeast.\n\nVarious military attempts have been made to use animals as delivery systems for weapons. In Song Dynasty China, oxen carrying large explosive charges were used as self-propelled explosive missiles. During World War II the United States investigated the use of \"bat bombs\", or bats carrying small incendiary bombs, while at the same time the Soviet Union developed the \"anti-tank dog\" for use against German tanks. Other attempts have included the so-called \"\"kamikaze\" dolphins\", intended to seek out and destroy submarines and enemy warships. There have been a number of documented incidents of animal-borne bomb attacks, in which donkeys, mules or horses were used to deliver bombs.\n\nSome insects explode altruistically, at the expense of the individual in defense of its colony; the process is called autothysis. Several species of ants, such as \"Camponotus saundersi\" in southeast Asia, can explode at will to protect their nests from intruders. \"C. saundersi\", a species of carpenter ant, can self-destruct by autothysis. Two oversized, poison-filled mandibular glands run the entire length of the ant's body. When combat takes a turn for the worse, the ant violently contracts its abdominal muscles to rupture its body and spray poison in all directions. Likewise, many species of termites, such as \"Globitermes sulphureus\", have members, deemed the soldier class, who can split their bodies open emitting a noxious and sticky chemical for the same reason.\n\nIn January 1932, the \"Townsville Daily Bulletin\", an Australian newspaper, reported an incident where a dairy cow was partially blown up and killed on a farm at Kennedy Creek (near Cardwell, North Queensland). The cow had reputedly picked up a detonator in her mouth while grazing in a paddock. This was only triggered later, when the cow began to chew her cud, at a time when she was in the process of being milked. The cow had its head blown off by the resulting explosion, and the farmer milking the cow was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe explosive rat, also known as a rat bomb, was a weapon developed by the British Special Operations Executive in World War II for use against Germany. Rat carcasses were filled with plastic explosives, and were to be distributed near German boiler rooms, where it was expected they would be disposed of by burning, with the subsequent explosion having a chance of causing a boiler explosion. The explosive rats never saw use, as the first shipment was intercepted by the Germans; however, the resulting search for more booby trapped rats consumed enough German resources for the SOE to conclude that the operation was a success.\n\nAccording to worldwide media reports in April 2005, toads in the Altona district of Hamburg were observed by nature protection officials to swell up with gases and explode, propelling their innards for distances of up to one meter. These incidents prompted local residents to refer to the area's lake—home to the toads—). The incidents were reported as occurring with greatest frequency between 2 and 3 a.m. Werner Smolnik, environmental movement worker, stated on April 26, 2005, at least 1,000 toads had died in this manner over a series of a few days. According to German conservationist Werner Smolnik, the toads expanded to three and a half times their normal size before blowing up, and were noted to live a short time after exploding.\n\nBerlin veterinarian Franz Mutschmann collected toad corpses and performed necropsies. He theorised that the phenomenon was linked to a recent influx of predatory crows to the area. He stated that the cause was a mixture of crow attacks and the natural puff up defense of the toads. Crows attacked the toads to pick through the skin between the amphibian's chest and abdominal cavity, picking out the liver, which appears to be a delicacy for crows in the area. In a defensive move, the toads begin to blow themselves up, which in turn, due to the hole in the toad's body and the missing liver, led to a rupture of blood vessels and lungs, and to the spreading of intestines. The apparent epidemic nature of the phenomenon was also explained by Mutschmann: \"Crows are intelligent animals. They learn very quickly how to eat the toads' livers.\" \nInitial theories had included a viral or fungal infection, possibly one also affecting foreign horses involved in racing at a nearby track. However, laboratory tests were unable to detect an infectious agent.\n\n"}

It describes a situation in which an event is given contradictory interpretations or descriptions by the individuals involved. \n\nThe effect is named after Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film \"Rashomon\", in which a murder is described in four contradictory ways by four witnesses. The term addresses the motives, mechanism, and occurrences of the reporting on the circumstance and addresses contested interpretations of events, the existence of disagreements regarding the evidence of events, and subjectivity versus objectivity in human perception, memory, and reporting.\n\nThe Rashomon effect has been defined in a modern academic context as \"the naming of an epistemological framework—or ways of thinking, knowing, and remembering—required for understanding complex and ambiguous situations\".\n\nThe history of the term and its permutations in cinema, literature, legal studies, psychology, sociology, and history is the subject of a 2015 multi-author volume edited by Blair Davis, Robert Anderson and Jan Walls.\n\nValerie Alia termed the same effect \"The Rashomon Principle\" and has used this variant extensively since the late 1970s, first publishing it in an essay on the politics of journalism in 1982. She developed the term in a 1997 essay \"The Rashomon Principle: The Journalist as Ethnographer\" and in her 2004 book, \"Media Ethics and Social Change\".\n\nA useful demonstration of this principle in scientific understanding can be found in Karl G. Heider's 1988 journal article on ethnography.

As typically measured, one kcal/mol represents a temperature increase of one degree Celsius in one liter of water (with a mass of 1kg) resulting from the reaction of one mole of reagents.\n\nIn SI units, one kilocalorie per mole is equal to 4.184 kilojoules per mole, or joules per molecule, or 0.043 eV per molecule.

AV signed to Sony S2 Records in 1994 but no recordings were ever released.\n\nAfter splitting from Drinnan in 1996, Ray went on to score a hit single in both the United Kingdom and the United States with his song \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" the following year. \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" reached No. 13 in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone.\n\nRay released his self-titled album in the U.S. in March 1998, but the album was never issued in the UK. The song \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" was successful in his native country reaching No. 13 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1997.\n\nRay followed up in 1998 (primarily in the UK) with \"Goin' to Vegas\", including a televised performance on \"Live and Kicking Friday\". It failed to enter the UK Top 40, only peaking at No. 47. A video for the single was made, but it (and the single) never aired in the U.S. In the summer of 1998, Ray went on a U.S. tour with the Backstreet Boys. In the autumn of 1998, a third promotional single and video clip, \"I Got Rolled\" was given minimal airplay.\n\nRay re-emerged in 2009 as a member of the Airplayers, a song production team.\n\nIn a November 2015 announcement on his official fan page, Ray stated that he was working on material for a comeback record. This was later confirmed in September 2016 on his record label's website: \"La Rocka Records was created in 2016 as a launchpad for UK singer Jimmy Ray's 'comeback' album tentatively titled 'Live to Fight Another Day'\". \n\n\n\n"}

It is long.\n\nBriley Pkwy., named in honor of former Nashville mayor Beverly Briley, passes the Grand Ole Opry House, Opry Mills, and the Opryland Hotel east of Nashville. It crosses the Cumberland River twice, once near Madison, and again on the west side of Nashville, near the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution and John C. Tune Airport. On the southeast portion of the loop, Briley Pkwy. crosses Interstate 40 and passes Nashville International Airport.\n\nBriley Parkway consists of the northern loop of SR 155 from I-40 on the west side of Nashville to I-24 southeast of downtown Nashville, which makes up about two thirds of the length of the highway. The entirety of Briley Pkwy. is a controlled access highway, except for the segment between I-24 and I-40, including the interchange with US 41/70S (Murfreesboro Pike), which is limited access. Between I-40 near the Nashville International Airport and Ellington Parkway (US 31 E), Briley Pkwy. is four lanes each way. The rest of the Pkwy. is two lanes each way. \n\nBriley Pkwy. begins at a full y interchange with I-40 in west Nashville (although the route continues to the south), and runs north at this point along the northeastern urban boundary of the city of Nashville. The first interchange is with Cockrill Bend Boulevard, which connects to the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. The parkway then crosses the Cumberland River on the Andrew B. Gibson Bridge, and has an interchange with County Hospital Road near the University School of Nashville. About later is an interchange with SR 12 and the parkway curves sharply to the northeast, running mostly east to west beyond this point. The next interchange, about later, is with US 41 Alternate near the neighborhood of Haynes Estates, and about later is an interchange with US 431 (Whites Creek Pike). About , Briley Pkwy. interchanges with I-24 in a cloverleaf interchange, and about beyond this is an interchange with Brick Church Pike. Beyond this point, Briley Pkwy. continues for another mile, and has a complicated interchange with US 31W/41 and I-65, and U.S. 31E southbound (Ellington Parkway) less than later. At these interchanges, US 31W/41 and I-65 southbound are accessible together from both directions, and I-65 northbound and Ellington Pkwy. are accessible together from the westbound lanes. From the eastbound lanes, I-65 northbound and Ellington Pkwy. are accessible independently. \n\nAt this point, Briley Pkwy. widens to eight lanes, and begins a brief concurrency with US 31E, which splits off as Gallatin Road at an interchange later. The highway then crosses the Cumberland River again, and sharply to the southeast, and has an interchange with McGavock Pike, which is a connector road to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, Music Valley, and the site of the Grand Ole Opry. Entering a short straightaway, Briley Pkwy. runs almost directly north-south at this point, and less than later has a trumpet interchange with a connector road to Opry Mills Mall. The next interchange, about later, is an interchange with Two Rivers Parkway. The parkway then shifts slightly to the west, before curving sharply to the east, and then to the west again, in somewhat of a \"c-shaped\" curve, before reaching an interchange with US 70 (Lebanon Pike) just under later. The route shifts slightly again, maintaining its general north-south direction, and reaches the next interchange, which is with Elm Hill Pike slightly over later. The parkway then curves to the southwest, and reaches a cloverstack interchange with Interstate 40 near the Nashville International Airport where the route reduces to two lanes in each direction and the freeway segment ends. Continuing as a limited access highway, Briley Pkwy. has intersections with three major thoroughfares before reaching a trumpet interchange with Airways Boulevard, a connector to the airport. The route continues for another mile, next to an industrial site adjacent to the airport before reaching an interchange with US 41/70S (Murfreesboro Pike). Running northeast–southwest, Briley Pkwy. continues for another , crossing a railroad, before reaching the interchange with I-24, a partial cloverleaf interchange which also includes access to a restricted connector road to an Averitt Express yard. At this interchange the limited access segment ends, although the Briley Pkwy. designation does not end until an intersection about later, where SR 155 becomes Thompson Lane.\n\nThe segment of SR 155 designated as White Bridge Road begins at the interchange with I-40 in west Nashville, where the route continues north as controlled-access Briley Parkway. This entire section of SR 155 is a four-lane major arterial thoroughfare with many intersections. Beyond this point, the route immediately has an intersection with US 70, and runs directly north-south before curving to the southeast over later near Nashville State Community College. The route the crosses a railroad and intersects with US 70S (Harding Road). At this intersection, the route becomes two-lane Woodmont Boulevard, and the SR 155 designation ends, although many maps show this segment as being part of SR 155. About later the road curves to the southeast, and begins running east-west nearly perfectly straight before reaching an intersection with US 431 (Hillsboro Pike). About later, the route widens back to four lanes and has an interchange with US 31 (Franklin Road), where the route becomes Thompson Lane, and SR 155 begins again, this time with a secondary designation. The route then crosses I-65 and intersects with Powell Avenue, which contains signs directing drivers to I-65. Continuing east, SR 155 crosses a railyard and about later intersects with US 31A/41A (Nolensville Pike). About later, the route reaches an intersection where Thompson Lane splits off to the north and the route becomes Briley Parkway, and the interchange with I-24 is less than beyond this point.\n\nThe segment of Briley Parkway between the intersection with Thompson Lane and Vultee Boulevard just north of US 41/70S opened to traffic in late October 1965. The segment between I-40 and US 70 in the Donelson neighborhood opened to traffic on July 1, 1967. Most of the segment of Briley Pkwy. between I-65 and I-24 in southeast Nashville was built in the 1960s, but the last section was not completed until March 30, 1978, with the opening of the approximately segment between I-65 and Gallatin Road. The section of Briley Pkwy. between I-40 in west Nashville and I-24 northwest of the city was built in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The last section of Briley Pkwy., the segment between Brick Church Pike and I-65 was completed in April 1998.\n\nBriley Pkwy. between US 31E (Ellington Parkway) and I-40 in eastern Nashville was widened from four to eight lanes in multiple projects. The first project, which began in early 1996, widened the route between Two Rivers Parkway and McGavock Pike, and was completed in May 1998. The contract for the stretch located between US 31E (Gallatin Pike) and McGavock Pike was awarded in October 2001. The next phase, between Elm Hill Pike and US 70, was awarded in August 2002, and the next phase, between US 70 and Two Rivers Parkway, was awarded in December 2002. The final phase involved widening the parkway between I-40 and Elm Hill Pike and reconstructing the interchange with I-40, which was completed in December 2006. Initially expected to be complete by June 30, 2005, the widening projects ran into multiple issues, including opposition from nearby residents, issues with right-of-way acquisition, and cost overruns, and were not completed until 2007.\n\nThe interchange at I-40 and White Bridge Road was reconstructed in two phases. Phase one was completed ahead of schedule in 2005; phase two, ramps to and from Briley and separating it from the White Bridge Road/I-40 interchange, was completed by 2011.\n\nCounterclockwise (CCW) reads down, clockwise (CW) reads up. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805880", "title": "Li Sao", "text": "Li Sao\n\n\"Li Sao\" (; translation: \"Encountering Sorrow\") is a Chinese poem from the anthology \"Chuci\", dating from the Warring States period of ancient China, generally attributed to Qu Yuan.\n\nThe poem \"Li Sao\" is the lead poem and the main inspiration for the \"Chuci\" collection. This famous piece was written by Qu Yuan, an aristocrat of the Kingdom of Chu, who died about 278 BCE.\n\nIn his signature poem \"Li Sao\", Qu Yuan manifests himself in a poetic character, which is a major landmark in the tradition of Classical Chinese poetry, contrasting with the anonymous poetic voices encountered in the \"Shijing\" and the other early poems which exist as preserved in the form of incidental incorporations into various documents of ancient miscellany. The rest of the \"Chuci\" anthology is centered on the \"Li Sao\", the purported biography of its author Qu Yuan, and often its innovative epic poetic lines. In the \"Li Sao\", the poet despairs that he has been plotted against by evil factions at court with his resulting rejection by his lord and then recounts a series of shamanistic spirit journeys to various mythological realms, engaging or attempting to engage with a variety of divine or spiritual beings, with the theme of the righteous minister unfairly rejected sometimes becoming exaggerated in the long history of later literary criticism and allegorical interpretation. Dating from the time of King Huai of Chu, in the late third century BCE, the poem \"Li Sao\" is a remarkable example of Chinese poetry.\n\nThe meaning of the title \"Li Sao\" is not straightforward.\n\nIn the biography of Qu Yuan, \"li sao\" is explained as being as equivalent to \"li you\" (Sima Qian, \"Shiji\" or the \"Records of the Grand Historian\"). Inference must be made that 'meeting with sorrow' must have been meant.\n\nHowever, it is explicitly glossed as \"encountering sorrow\" in Ban Gu's commentary (\"Li Sao zan shu\" \"Laudatory Preface to the \"Li Sao\"\").\n\nThe \"Li Sao\" begins with the poet's introduction of himself, his ancestry, and some references to his current situation, and then proceeds to recount the poet's fantastical physical and spiritual trip across the landscapes of ancient China, real and mythological. \"Li Sao\" is a seminal work in the large Chinese tradition of landscape and travel literature. \"Li Sao\" is also a political allegory in which the poet laments that his own righteousness, purity, and honor are unappreciated and go unused in a corrupt world. The poet alludes to being slandered by enemies and being rejected by the king he served (King Huai of Chu).\n\nAs a representative work of Chu poetry it makes use of a wide range of metaphors derived from the culture of Chu, which was strongly associated with a Chinese form of shamanism, and the poet spends much of the \"Li Sao\" on a spirit journey visiting with spirits and deities. The poem's main themes include Qu Yuan's falling victim to intrigues in the court of Chu, and subsequent exile; his desire to remain pure and untainted by the corruption that was rife in the court; and also his lamentation at the gradual decline of the once-powerful state of Chu.\n\nThe poet decides to leave and join Peng Xian (), a figure that many believe to be the God of Sun. Wang Yi, the Han dynasty commentator to the \"Chuci\", believed Peng Xian to have been a Shang dynasty official who, legend says, drowned himself after his wise advice was rejected by the king (but this legend may have been of later make, influenced by the circumstances of Qu Yuan drowning himself) Peng Xian may also have been an ancient shaman who later came to symbolize hermit seclusion.\n\nThe poem has a total of 373 lines, and about 2400 characters, which makes it one of the longest poems dating from Ancient China. It is in the \"fu\" style. The precise date of composition is unknown, it would seem to have written by Qu Yuan after his exile by King Huai; however, it seems to have been before Huai's captivity in the state of Qin began, in 299 BCE.\n\nThe poem was reissued in the 19th century by Pan Zuyin (1830–90), a linguist who was a member of the Qing Dynasty staff. It was reissued as four volumes with two prefaces, one by Li Kai and the other by Xiao Yuncong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Summons of the Soul\" consists of a four-part poem. The first part consists of a few lines with no clear relationship to the rest of the poem. The second part is a prolog in the form of a conversation in heaven, in which God (帝) orders the Ancestor Shaman Wu Yang (巫陽) to go down below to earth and help out in the case of someone whose soul has wandered off. Part three is the actual summoning of the soul, by means of threats and temptations. The fourth part is an epilog (\"luan\"). (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 222) The authorship of \"Summons of the Soul\" has been attributed to Qu Yuan, but Song Yu is more likely. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 223) The \"Summons of the Soul\" is very similar, but longer, than another of the \"Chu ci\" poems, \"The Great Summons\" (\"Da zhao\"). Both poems derive from a shamanic tradition of summoning the soul of someone who has seemed to die, most likely originally with the intention of having it to re-animate its former body (but in the later literary tradition this was meant more allegorically). The two poems both follow a similar pattern: threats of dangers lurking in all directions to which the soul might wander and then detailed lists with tempting descriptions of magnificent sensual pleasures which would be available as a reward for the souls obedient return (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 219-221)\n\nVarious interpretations of the \"Summoning the Soul\" have been made, as to whose soul is being summoned, by whom, and in what context.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1805911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805911", "title": "Jiu Ge", "text": "Jiu Ge\n\n, or Nine Songs, () is an ancient set of poems. Together, these poems constitute one of the 17 sections of the poetry anthology which was published under the title of the \"Chuci\" (also known as the \"Songs of Chu\" or as the \"Songs of the South\"). Despite the \"\"Nine\", \" in the title, the number of these poetic pieces actually consists of eleven separate songs, or elegies. This set of verses seems to be part of some rituals of the Yangzi River valley area (as well as a northern tradition or traditions) involving the invocation of divine beings and seeking their blessings by means of a process of courtship. Though the poetry consists of lyrics written for a performance, the lack of indications of who is supposed to be singing at any one time or whether some of the lines represent lines for a chorus makes an accurate reconstruction impossible. Nonetheless there are internal textual clues, for example indicating the use of costumes for the performers, and an extensive orchestra.\n\nIn common with other \"Chuci\" works, the authorship of these 11 poems has been attributed to the poet Qu Yuan, who lived over two-thousand years ago. Sinologist \nDavid Hawkes finds evidence for this eclectic suite of eleven poems having been written by, \"a poet (or poets) at the Chu court in Shou-chun (241-223) B.C.\"\n\nThe \"\"Jiu Ge\"\" songs include eleven (despite the \"Nine\" in the title). Nine of the verses are addressed to deities by a type of shaman, one to the spirits of fallen warriors who died fighting far from home, and the concluding verse. The reason for the discrepancy between the 9 verses referred to in the title and the fact that there are actually 11 is uncertain, although an important question, which has had several possible explanations put forth. Of these explanations, some may be rooted in general Chinese number magic or symbology. More specifically, David Hawkes points out that \"nine songs\" is referenced in the seminal \"Chu Ci\" work, \"Li Sao\", referring to the nine (twice times nine?) dances of Qi of Xia.\n\nCritics and scholars have elaborated various hypotheses as to why the \"Jiu Ge\" (\"\"Nine Songs\"\") consists of eleven songs, rather than nine. An obvious, and common, suggestion has been that Number 1 and Number 11 songs are somehow to be classified as an introduction and a \"luan\": examination of Song 1 and Song 11 fails to support this convenient conjecture, however. Sinologists Masaru Aoki and David Hawkes propose that for performance purposes there were nine songs/dances performed at each a spring and at an autumn performance, with the spring performance featuring Songs 3 and 5, but not 4 or 6, and the autumnal performance 4 and 6, but not 3 or 5 (with the songs otherwise being performed in numerical order). Another explanation has to do with ancient ideas about numbers and numbering, where by the use of a numeric term, an order of magnitude, estimation, or other symbolic qualities are meant, rather than a specific quantity. 11 songs could be \"about 9\" songs.\n\nThe following table shows the eleven individual poems of the \"Nine Songs\". The English translations are following those of David Hawkes, although he uses Roman numerals for the traditional song order.\n\nIllustrated versions of the \"Chuci\" exist. Below is a selection from the \"Nine Songs\":\n\nOf the 11 songs of the \"Jiu Ge\", 9 are addressed to deities and 1 to the spirits of dead heroes (the last verse section is a conclusional cauda). These deities include He Bo, also known as the River Earl or as the Count of the River, and the Lord (or God) of the Clouds.\n\nThe character with which Song 1 concerns itself is Taiyi (the Grand Unity) \"and\" Lord of the East. This is not a common concept in other Chinese historical sources. The character of this divinity resolves readily as two familiar parts, here coupled together.\n\nThe God of Clouds (Yunzhong Jun) was worshipped in the hope of rain and good weather for crops. This poem can be divided into two parts: one part is sung by the person who does the offering and the other part is sung by the person who acts as the God of Clouds in the form of antiphonal singing in order to show their admiration towards God of Clouds. The God of Clouds is sometimes seen as male and sometimes seen as female, but in Chinese literature, the God of Clouds is usually portrayed as female. This poem expresses the characteristics of the God of Clouds, the deep desire that human have towards God, and how God responds to people's prayer through the antiphonal singing of human and God.\n\nHe Bo has been the deity of the Yellow River, one of the world's major rivers, and one with close association with Chinese Culture. As such, He Bo has been associated with control of that wild river's occasional devastating floods and general qualities as an agricultural aquifer.\n\nThe Lord of the East is the sun, in its aspect as a deity of the morning.\n\nThe Master of Fate is known as Siming (司命) with various English translations (such as, Controller of Fate, Deified Judge of Life, and Director of Destinies). Siming is both an abstract deity (or more rather title thereof) and a celestial asterism. In the Daoist case of the Three Worms, Siming, as Director of Destinies, has the bureaucratic function of human lifespan allocation. As an asterism, or apparent stellar constellation, Siming is associated both with the Wenchang Wang star pattern, near the Big Dipper, in (Aquarius (Chinese astronomy)), and with a supposed celestial bureaucrat official of fate.\n\nQu Yuan is the protagonist and author of much of the \"Chu ci\" opus: whether or not he wrote the \"Jiu ge\" pieces while he was in exile is an open question. Certainly the work appears underlain by earlier tradition, as well as possible editing during the reign of Han Wudi. Whether he makes a cameo appearance is also not known.\n\nThe shamanic voice is an important part of the proceedings here.\n\nShan Gui is a Mountain Spirit.\n\nThe astronomical Siming (actually part of asterism 虛, \"Emptiness\") consists of the Deified Judge of Life star group.

Various conceptions of them exist. Of these conceptions, one set consists of ancient folk belief, and another of more modern interpretation.\n\nThe individual poems of the \"Jiu Ge\" are related to each other as parts of a religious drama, meant for performance; however, the individual roles of each and their relationship to each other is a matter for interpretive reinterpretation, rather than something known.\n\nSome aspects of the dramatic performance are known, mostly through internal evidence. The performances were evidently replete with fantastic shamanic costumes, were probably performed indoors, and with orchestral accompaniment to the tune of \"lithophones, musical bells, drums, and various kinds of wind and string instruments\"\n\nHowever, in the case of any individual poem, its role in the overall performance is not necessarily determinable. They may represent monologues, dialogues, choral pieces, or combinations thereof, within the individual pieces or between them.\n\nThe titles of the individual poems which follow are loosely based on David Hawkes:\n\nThe first \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece is a dedication to a deity (\"Dong huang tai yi\").\n\nThe second \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece addresses another deity (\"Yun-zhong jun\").\n\nThe third and fourth \"Jiu ge\" poetic pieces involve a deity, male, female, singular or plural: the Chinese is not marked for number or gender (\"Xiang jun\" and \"Xiang fu-ren\").\n\nThe fifth and sixth \"Jiu ge\" poetic pieces involve a deity singular or plural: the Chinese is not clear as to whether the \"lesser\" and \"greater\" in the titles refers to a distinction between the two Siming (Master of Fate) poems or if it refers to a distinction between two Siming, Masters of Fate (\"Xiang jun\" and \"Xiang fu-ren\").\n\nThe seventh \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece addresses involves the deity \"Dong jun\".\n\nThe eighth \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece involves another deity (\"Hebo\").\n\nThe ninth \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece addresses another deity (\"Shan gui\").\n\nThe tenth \"Jiu ge\" poem (\"Guo shang\") is a hymn to soldiers killed in war (\"Guo shang\"). \"Guó\" (國) means the \"state\", \"kingdom\", or \"nation\". \"Shāng\" (殤) means to \"die young\". Put together, the title refers to those who meet death in the course of fighting for their country. David Hawkes describes it as \"surely one of the most beautiful laments for fallen soldiers in any language\". The meter is a regular seven-character verse, with three characters separated by the exclamatory particle \"兮\" followed by three more characters, each composing a half line, for a total of nine lines of 126 characters.(國殤)\n\nThe historical background of the poem involves the ancient type of warfare practiced in ancient China. Included are references to arms and weapons, ancient states or areas, and the mixed use of chariots in warfare. A good historical example of this type of contest is the \"Battle of Yanling\", which features similar characteristics and problems experienced by participants in this type of fighting, such as greatly elevated mortality rates for both horses and humans.\n\nThe poem is translated as \"Battle\" by Arthur Waley (1918, in \"A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems\")\n\n<poem>\n\n[2] I.e., military genius.\n\nThe eleventh \"Jiu ge\" poetic piece concludes the corpus (\"Li hun\").\n\nThe first translation of the \"Nine Songs\" into a European language was done by the Viennese scholar August Pfizmaier (1808-1887). Over 100 years later Arthur Waley (1889-1966) accredited it as \"an extremely good piece of work, if one \nconsiders the time when it was made and the meagreness of the material to which Pfizmaier had access.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1805917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805917", "title": "Our Lady of Perpetual Help", "text": "Our Lady of Perpetual Help\n\nOur Lady of Perpetual Help (also known as Our Lady of Perpetual Succour) is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary as represented in a celebrated 15th-century Byzantine icon also associated with the same Marian apparition.\n\nThe icon originated from the Keras Kardiotissas Monastery and has been in Rome since 1499. Today it is permanently enshrined in the Church of Saint Alphonsus, where the official Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help text is prayed weekly. \n\nOn 23 June 1867, Pope Pius IX granted the image its Canonical Coronation along with its present title. The Redemptorist Congregation of priests and brothers are the only religious order currently entrusted by the Holy See to protect and propagate a Marian religious work of art. In the Eastern Orthodox Church iconography, the image is known as the \"”Virgin Theotokos of the Passion\"” due to the instruments of the Passion of Jesus Christ present on the image.\n\nThe feast day of the image is celebrated on June 27, with novena devotions held every Wednesday. Under Pope Pius XII's Pontificate, the image was designated as the national Patroness of the Republic of Haiti and Almoradi, Spain.\n\nDue to promotion by the Redemptorist Priests since 1865, the image has become very popular among Roman Catholics. Modern reproductions are oftentimes displayed in residential homes, commercial establishments, and public transportation.\n\nThe original wooden icon is suspended on the altar, measures 17\" × 21\" inches and is written on hard nut wood with a gold leaf background. The image depicts the following symbols: \n\nByzantine depictions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in art have three stars, one star each on the shoulder and one on the forehead. This type of icon is called Hodegetria, where Mary is pointing to her Son, known as a \"Theotokos of the Passion\".\n\nMary has long slender nose, thin lips, and smoothly arched eyebrows, evidence of being made by a Greek artist. The veil and her face itself are rounded, indicating holiness. The size of the mother is also out of proportion to her son, a deliberate intent by the artist to show Mary as larger than life.\n\nThe Greek inscriptions read MP-ΘΥ (Μήτηρ Θεοῦ, \"Mother of God\"), ΟΑΜ (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Μιχαήλ, \"Michael the Archangel\"), ΟΑΓ (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Γαβριήλ, \"Gabriel the Archangel\") and IC-XC (Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, \"Jesus Christ\"), respectively. \n\nThe icon has a gold background on a walnut panel, believed to be from Crete. The Cretan School was the source of the many icons imported into Europe from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance. The gold background represents the Kingdom of God. The round halo surrounding the Virgin Mary's head is styled called \"Estofado\", which is an artistic effect created by making dented holes into the icon to reflect light from the gold background. The icon was cleaned and restored once in 1866 and again in the year 1940.\n\nPopular legends claim that the icon to be a true copy of a painting that according to legend was painted by Saint Luke using the meal table of the Holy Family in Nazareth, and in Eastern Orthodox tradition was often identified with the \"Hodegetria\" icon, and consider it to be a miraculous imprint of the Virgin Mary both in the Latin and Orthodox communities. This belief is common in many Hodegetria icons who have similar claims of Lucan legends.\n\nThe earliest written account of the image comes from a Latin and Italian plaque placed in the church of San Matteo in Via Merulana where it was first venerated by the public in 1499. The writer of the icon is unknown, but according to a parchment attached to the painting that accompanied the icon, it was stolen by a merchant sailing to Rome from the island of Crete. (The Keras Kardiotissas Monastery is regarded as the monastery from which the icon was stolen.) The image remained in the private possession of a Roman merchant and his family until 27 March 1499, when the icon was transferred to the church of San Matteo where it remained for 300 years. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo.\n\nThe Redemptorists, (The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer) a congregation within the Roman Catholic Church, maintain a robust account of the icon and its passage from the private hands of a merchant family in Rome to its final and current location at the Church of St. Alphonsus De Liguori, on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. The accounting includes the story of a merchant who secured the icon from Crete, and brought it to his family's home in Rome, during the late 15th century. The story includes a passage of a young member of the family, the six-year-old daughter of the merchant, who was visited by the Virgin Mary in a dream. Part of the accounting includes the following passage: \n\n\"At last, the Blessed Virgin appeared to the six-year-old daughter of this Roman family and told her to tell her mother and grandmother that the picture of Holy Mary of Perpetual Help should be placed in the Church of St. Matthew the Apostle, located between the basilicas of St. Mary Major and St. John Lateran.\"\n\nThe family delivered the icon to the church. \n\nThe icon remained at St. Matthew's for three centuries. For at least the final 60 years of the 18th century, St. Matthew's was occupied by an Irish Augustinian congregation of the Catholic Church. When war broke out in Rome in 1798, the icon was moved to the Church of St. Mary in Posterula, near the \"Umberto I\" bridge that crosses the Tiber River in Rome. The icon remained \"hidden\" there until Pope Pius IX granted the possession of the icon to the Redemptorists by Papal Edict, in 1865. The Church of St. Mary in Posterula was later demolished in 1880. \n\nAccording to the account by the Redemptorists: \"In January 1866, Fathers Michael Marchi and Ernest Bresciani went to St. Mary's in Posterula to receive the picture from the Augustinians.\" . The Redemptorists had purchased the property where the former St. Matthew's had stood, and had established and built the current Church of St. Alphonsus De Liguori, in honor of the founder of their congregation. Thus, the venerated icon of the Catholic Church was returned to the location described by the Virgin Mary in the dream of the merchant's daughter, that is, at the church between St. Mary Major and St. John Lateran. \n\nRedemptorist tradition holds that Pope Pius IX declared, in 1866, that the Redemptorists make the icon known to the world, and so, several copies were made and sent to Redemptorist parishes around the world. One such Redemptorist parish in the United States, St. Mary's in Annapolis, Maryland, received a copy from Rome in 1868. The image is prominently displayed within the sanctuary of the parish.\n\nIn 1798, French troops under Louis-Alexandre Berthier occupied Rome as part of the French Revolutionary Wars, establishing the\nshort-lived Roman Republic and taking Pope Pius VI prisoner. Among the several churches demolished during the French occupation was San Matteo in Via Merulana, which housed the icon. The Augustinian friars who rescued the icon first took it to the nearby Church of St. Eusebius, then later set it up on a side altar in the Church of Santa Maria in Posterula.\n\nIn January 1855, the Redemptorist priests purchased \"Villa Caserta\" in Rome along the Via Merulana and converted it into their headquarters. Decades later, Pope Pius IX invited the Redemptorist Fathers to set up a Marian house of veneration in Rome, in response to which the Redemptorists built the Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori at that location. The Redemptorists were thus established on the Via Merulana, not knowing that it had once been the site of the Church of San Matteo and shrine of the once-famous icon.\n\nPope Pius IX sent a letter dated 11 December 1865 to Father General Mauron, C.Ss.R., ordered that the image be once again publicly venerated in Via Merulana, the new church of Saint Alphonsus. The same Pontiff directed the Augustinian friars to surrender the icon to the Redemptorist priests, on condition that the Redemptorists must supply the Augustinians with another picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help or a good copy of the icon in exchange as a gesture of goodwill.\nPope Pius IX instructions to the Redemptorists were:\n\nUpon its official transfer, Pope Pius IX finally gave his Apostolic Blessing and titled the icon \"Mater de Perpetuo Succursu\" (Mother of Perpetual Help). Two years later, on 23 June 1867, the image was given a Canonical Coronation by the Dean of the Vatican Chapter in a solemn and official recognition of the Marian icon under that title. \n\nOn 21 April 1866, the Redemptorist Superior General gave one of the first copies of the icon to Pope Pius IX. This copy is preserved in the chapel of the Redemptorists' Generalate in Rome. The original icon remains under the care of the Redemptorist Fathers at the Church of St. Alphonsus with the latest restoration of the icon having taken place in 1990.\n\nIn 1866, the icon underwent restoration by the Polish painter Leopold Nowotny (1822-1870).\n\nIn 1990, the icon was taken down from its altar for new photography and image restoration commissioned by the General Government of Redemptorists. The Redemptorist Order entered into contract with the Technical Department at the Vatican Museum to restore the icon and prevent further fungal damage to the icon. The restoration process involved X-ray, infra-red scanning, technical analysis of the paint and ultra-violet testing along with a Carbon-14-test which placed the icon between the year 1325-1480. Artistic analysis of the icon revealed that the facial structure of the icon was altered due to previous overpainting, resulting in a combination of \"oriental and occidental\" features of the image.\n\nOur Lady of Perpetual Help has been venerated across many cultures and thus bears several titles in different languages, such as \"Mother of Perpetual Succour\", \"Mutter von immerwährenden Hilfe\", \"Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro\", \"Notre-Dame du Perpétuel Secours\", \"Mater del Perpetuo Succursu\", and \"Ina ng Laging Saklolo\". \n\nIn 1878, the Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston, Massachusetts obtained a certified copy of the icon being the first in the United States. Between 1927 and 1935, the first American novena service dedicated to the icon was recited in Saint Alphonsus \"The Rock\" church in St. Louis, Missouri and various other Redemptorist stations around the United States.\n\nThere is a shrine to Our Lady of Perpetual Help at the Redemptorist Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in Manhattan; and at the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (Brooklyn).\n\nOur Lady of Perpetual Help is widely venerated by Filipino Catholics and Overseas Filipino communities. A German copy of the icon is venerated in the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help in Baclaran, Parañaque City, Metro Manila – the country's centre of devotion to the icon. Pope John Paul II once offered a Catholic Mass at the shrine as cardinal, and later prayed before the icon during his first pastoral visit to the country in February 1981.\n\nAlmost all Catholic churches and chapels in the Philippines have a replica of the icon, often enshrined in a side altar. Copies of the icon can also be found in countless houses, businesses, and even public utility vehicles.\n\nEvery Wednesday, many congregations hold services where they publicly recite the rosary and the icon's associated novena, along with a priest delivering Benediction and celebrating a votive Mass in its honor. Devotees today still use the same Novena booklet first published by Irish Redemptorists, who introduced the icon and its devotion to the Philippines in the early 1900s. The Filipino Diaspora continue keeping the Wednesday Novena, holding novena services in their respective parishes overseas.\n\nIn Saint John the Baptist Parish, Garcia Hernandez, Bohol, the feast of the image is held on April 27 instead of the usual liturgical date. The 48 sub-chapels in the parish participate in the annual feast, while every 27th month has each chapel's respective congregations holding a procession of the icon. This form of the devotion began in 1923 when two missionary priests, a Dutchman named Thomas and a German named Jorge, brought the icon to the town. The original icon can still be seen in a chapel of the parish; its reverse bears a Latin inscription attesting to its dedication.\n\nIn the province of Nueva Ecija, Our Lady of Perpetual Help is widely venerated. Yearly, a first class relic is exposed to the faithful from June 18 until June 27.\n\nThe town of Almoradi, Spain invokes the patronage of Our Mother of Perpetual Help. In 1918, the son of Marquis of Rioflorido, Jose Carlos fell ill with pleurisy. His mother, the noble lady Desamparado Fontes fed him a silk fabric cloth touched to the icon of Perpetual Help in Rome which resulted in an instantaneous healing later claimed to be miraculous. As a token of thanksgiving, the lady Fontes officially donated funds to begin the Confraternity of Almoradi. On 29 May 1919, Our Lady of Perpetual Help was officially enthroned in Saint Andrew's Parish as the official patroness of the town. In 1945, Pope Pius XII confirmed this patronage by a pontifical decree. On its 50th anniversary in 1969, a public coronation of this image was held and the crowns were made by Santero artist \"Jose David\" by the town mayor and its authorities. \n\nIn addition to this, Our Lady of Perpetual Help is the designated the national patron saint of Haiti. According to Roman Catholic Bishop Guy Sansaricq, former Haitian president Élie Lescot and his cabinet petitioned the Holy See to make Our Mother of Perpetual Help the national Patroness of Haiti in 1942. Many Haitians credit the Virgin Mary under this title in performing miracles to prevent a cholera and smallpox outbreak which ravaged the country in 1882. The Holy See approved the request for patronage under the Pontificate of Pope Pius XII. The Our Lady of Perpetual Help is also present in numerous Haitian public stamps used by the Haitian postal office. In January 2010, Pope Benedict XVI invoked Our Lady of Perpetual Help for Haiti's earthquake relief through Archbishop Louis Kébreau.\n\nOur Lady of Perpetual Help is also the patroness of the Diocese of Salina, Kansas in the United States, of the Diocese of Middlesbrough in England, and of the Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n"}

In recognition of his stewardship of the CPR and its contributions to the war effort during the Great War, Shaughnessy was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1916 as Baron Shaughnessy, of the City of Montreal in the Dominion of Canada and of Ashford in the County of Limerick.\n\nShaughnessy was born October 6, 1853, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was the son of Irish Catholics, Lieutenant Tom Shaughnessy (1818–1903), \"one of the shrewdest detectives and patrolmen\" in the early Milwaukee Police Department, and his wife Mary Kennedy (1826–1905). His father was born at Ashford, in Killeedy, County Limerick, and like his wife they came to the United States during the Irish Potato Famine, about 1840.\n\nShaughnessy briefly attended the Spencerian Business College of Milwaukee, but at the age of 16 went to work for the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, first as a clerk, then as a bookkeeper.\n\nIn 1875, he became the adjutant of the 1st Regiment of the Wisconsin State Militia. That same year he was elected to the Milwaukee Common Council from the Third Ward, at that time heavily Irish-American. He was re-elected from 1875 through 1882, serving in the latter year as President of the Council. and briefly, in 1882, as its president.\n\nIn 1880 William Cornelius Van Horne, the new general superintendent of what was now called the Milwaukee Road, appointed him as a purchasing agent. In the wake of a report by Shaughnessy and two colleagues on best practices of stores departments of other large railroads and recommending changes in the Road's own practices, Shaughnessy, now appointed storekeeper, was charged with implementing the changes on the Milwaukee Road.\n\nShaughnessy arrived in Montreal in November 1882 to work for the Canadian Pacific Railway. He is described by E. A. James, Van Horne's private telegrapher, as \"a fashionably-dressed, alert young man, sporting a cane and giving general evidence of being what we call a live wire.\" The perpetually well-dressed perfectionist Shaughnessy (who appears to have been obsessive-compulsive as well; he obsessed over cleanliness, washed his hands repeatedly every day, and as president would refuse to share an elevator with anyone else) became known for tight cost controls and a meticulous scrutiny of purchases and other expenditures. The \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography\" states, Shaughnessy had an essentially pessimistic view of human nature... He was convinced that, given the opportunity, suppliers, contractors, carriers, workers, and anyone else would cheat the company. Constant vigilance was essential. Everything had to be done in accordance with the many rules and regulations he introduced. He delighted in tracing even minor transgressions and then publicly humiliating the perpetrators, usually in writing to ensure that the information became a part of the permanent record. Even the company's most trusted contractors and senior officials were exposed to his wrath if, in their efforts to get necessary work done on time, they paid prices higher than was deemed appropriate or if they failed in any other way to follow his system. He also managed expenditures by delaying payments as long as possible on whatever excuse, to the extent permitted by law and practicalities: a practice which is credited in most histories of the CPR as being in part responsible for the ability of the line to stay afloat, particularly during the period in the early months of 1885, when the very difficult section of the line along Lake Superior was being financed by the faith and credit of the corporation.\n\nShaughnessy became CPR's assistant general manager in 1885; assistant president in September 1889; and in 1891 Shaughnessy became a director and vice-president of the railroad. He succeeded Van Horne as president in 1899. He immediately proceeded to centralize financial operations in the Montreal corporation headquarters, taking centralized control over budget, earnings, and allocations, while devolving operational control to divisional heads in the field; a policy he had been urging upon Van Horne for some time. He was a great admirer of Van Horne, and continued grateful for his long-time patron's friendship and help, but was outspoken about what he saw as Van Horne's legacy of a lack of systematic organization and management.\n\nDuring his presidency, the Canadian Pacific's steamship services, first domestic, then from Vancouver to Asia (the Empress Line), then trans-Atlantic, were steadily expanded and upgraded, eventually making this railroad one of the world's major shipping owners as well. To promote tourism and passenger traffic, new or existing CPR-owned hotels, chalets and mountain camps were expanded or built in from the Maritimes to Victoria, each held to Shaughnessy's meticulous standards for cleanliness. The CPR under Shaughnessy controlled the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada and The Crow's Nest Pass Railway.\n\nUnder Shaughnessy's administration, the CPR's mileage in western Canada almost doubled. The Canadian Northern Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway sought and often received subsidies in order to compete effectively with the politically-unpopular CPR (which had itself benefitted by federal cash and land subsidies in its early years). Shaughnessy held his own before the newly created Board of Railway Commissioners, successfully arguing that higher rates in Western Canada were justified by the high costs, an argument which would finally be officially accepted by the Board in 1914.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Shaughnessy was a strong backer of the Empire's war, and put CPR's resources behind it as well. Shaughnessy's work in support of the war effort was the reason for his elevation to the peerage in 1916. By this point the former Milwaukeean was \"an Imperialist's Imperialist, a staunch supporter of Monarch, Empire and Nation\", so British in outlook that he is reported to have been offered (but declined) a cabinet post under H. H. Asquith.\n\nThe younger of his two sons (both were serving overseas), Alfred Thomas, was killed in action in France while serving in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.\n\nShaughnessy resigned from the presidency of the CPR in 1918, citing his deteriorating eyesight. He would continue to serve as chairman of the board until his death.\n\nShaughnessy died 10 December 1923 after a heart attack the day before. On his deathbed, he instructed his successor as head of the CPR, Edward Wentworth Beatty: \"Maintain the property. It is a great Canadian property, and a great Canadian enterprise.\" His eldest son, William James Shaughnessy, succeeded him as second Baron Shaughnessy.\n\nShaughnessy represented the CPR on the boards of major financial institutions with which it had extensive dealings, including the Bank of Montreal, the Royal Trust Company, the Accident Insurance Company of North America, and The Guarantee Company of North America. He was in agreement with most of the Anglophone Canadian corporate élite, (including ex-Americans like Van Horne and himself), in opposing the Liberal government's suggestion of a reciprocal free trade agreement with the United States, and like most of them, joined in providing powerful support for Robert Borden's Conservative opposition in the 1911 election which swept Laurier's Liberals out of power after 15 years in power. When Shaughnessy urged, \"Fix the channels of Canadian trade eastward and westward,\" it was immediately pointed out that this policy was in accordance with the financial interest of his railway.\n\nShaughnessy House, his home in Montreal's Golden Square Mile, was designed by Montreal architect William Thomas in 1876. Though reduced from its original size, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 and is now part of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. The surrounding district is named Shaughnessy Village. Vancouver's prestigious neighbourhood of Shaughnessy is also named after him.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Bridget Nagle in 1880. The Shaughnessys had two sons (William James Shaughnessy served as captain and adjutant of the Duchess of Connaught's Irish-Canadian Rangers, second Baron Shaughnessy; and Alfred Thomas Shaughnessy, killed in action in 1916 while serving as a captain in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France ) and three daughters, including Marguerite Kathleen Shaughnessy, for whom the CPR coastal liner was named. Alfred Thomas was the father of the writer and producer Alfred Shaughnessy, best known for serving as the script editor of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" and father of director and voice-over actor David Shaughnessy and actor Charles Shaughnessy (\"Days of Our Lives, The Nanny\"), who is the fifth and current holder of the title Baron Shaughnessy.\n\nArchives Canada has his papers from later years at the CPR (1913–1922), plus other materials connected with the family, particularly the second Baron Shaughnessy. They are housed in the Glenbow Archives in Calgary, Alberta.\n\n\n\n"}

Hughes's MLB career began in 1983 performing as a TV play-by-play man for the Minnesota Twins, after which he spent 12 years in Milwaukee for the Brewers. Hughes also spent 17 years as a radio/TV game-caller for Marquette University basketball. In November 1995, Pat Hughes was selected by WGN Radio in Chicago to be the new \"Voice of the Cubs\". Hughes partnered with color commentator Ron Santo, former Hall of Fame third baseman for the Cubs, from 1996 to 2010, when Santo died. Their on-air chemistry came to be known as the \"Pat and Ron Show\". Besides Santo, Hughes has worked regularly as an on-air partner with other luminaries Harry Caray, Bob Uecker, and Al McGuire.\n\nPat Hughes made Chicago Cubs history in the 2016 World Series.

{"id": "1805981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805981", "title": "Just in sequence", "text": "Just in sequence\n\nJust in sequence (JIS) is an inventory strategy that matches just in time (JIT) and complete fit in sequence with variation of assembly line production. Components and parts arrive at a production line right in time as scheduled before they get assembled. Feedback from the manufacturing line is used to coordinate transportation to and from the process area. When implemented successfully, JIS improves a company's return on assets (ROA), without loss in flexibility, quality or overall efficiency. JIS is mainly implemented with automobile manufacturing.\n\nJIS is sometimes called in-line vehicle sequencing (ILVS).\n\nJust in Sequence (JIS) is just one specialised strategy to achieve Just In Time (JIT). The process concept of JIT sees buffers at the production line as waste in capital bound. The aim is to eliminate buffers as much as possible at expense of stability when disturbances arise. Just In Sequence is one of the most extreme applications of the concept, where components arrive Just In Time and sequenced for consumption.\n\nThe sequencing allows companies to eliminate supply buffers as soon as the quantity in component part buffers necessary is reduced to a minimum. If not sequencing according to scheduled variety of production, all required components must be stocked in buffers. For flexible production lines, such as a modern automotive assembly line, the variety is an option to produce directly on customer orders. As soon as the next order arrives at the work center, the scheduler distributes the supply orders inline with the production sequence of the final production line.\n\nHowever, with JIS the buffer quantities are displaced upward in material flow to the components suppliers. It is a misinterpretation of JIS to assume that all buffers will be eliminated. Hence just the cost for buffer inventory becomes re-allocated to the producers of the supplies. Sequencing eliminates buffers in the final assembly line by consolidating all similar components into distributed and sequenced buffers, which partly reside on the paths of transportation to final assembly. This strategy thus reduces the line-side inventory buffer. However, the effect is worse when the sequence does not get correctly scheduled upwards or when the transportation line gets congested.\n\nJust In Sequence processes are typically implemented only after the company has achieved a high degree of competency on Just In Time processes. The first step for the organization is to implement JIT processes to synchronize all manufacturing and material departments inside the plant and to collaborate with suppliers, customers, and sub-contractors to reduce inventory buffers to within a few hours. This process typically uncovers deep manufacturing and logistic issues that are not easy to overcome (see JIT Implementation for more details). The manufacturing company can only benefit from sequencing items once these problems have been resolved successfully and components are delivered Just In Time.\n\nSequencing can be implemented in a Just In Time supply operation at many levels, bringing ever-higher inventory reduction and financial benefits:\n\nJust In Sequence implementations introduce a number of new process requirements on top of Just In Time practices. A production sequence or final assembly sequence must be shared upwards to suppliers and sub-contractors. Feedback to customers must be organized according to the scheduled output to earn all positive financial effects. For these and other reasons, the actual production sequence must be \"broadcast\" out to all relevant parties once it is firm. This \"broadcast\" can be done over the phone, paper, email, or other automated IT system. UN/EDIFACT supports an EDI message standard called DELJIT as one standardized way to communicate this information.\n\nOnce the sequence is broadcast, each party must immediately take action to deliver sequenced parts in time. In many cases the turn-around time from broadcast to final assembly is less than 2 hours, with some components required in 30 minutes or less. With this time frame, there is little room for errors. In addition, quality inspection and poka-yoke must be implemented in the sequencing step to guarantee that the sequenced components match the assembly sequence perfectly. In many cases, suppliers must manage periodic sequence reversals, for example, when loading racks into a truck, since the first rack into the truck is the last one to come out. Employees and systems must also properly manage exceptional scenarios, such as re-processing damaged items after initial sequencing, skipping slots for scrapped items, etc. Just In Sequence implementations can only be successful if all of these processes are implemented correctly and all people involved understand what is at stake.\n\nIn many manufacturing operations, the actual production sequence cannot be planned ahead of time with enough certainty to enable sequencing. The main reason is that some manufacturing processes require re-work frequently so that a scheduled sequence becomes irrelevant. For example, painting operations in an automotive plant can have re-work levels of up to 20% (USA, Southern Europe).\n\nStephan M.

{"id": "1805983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805983", "title": "Naval militia", "text": "Naval militia\n\nA naval militia in the United States is a reserve military organization administered under the authority of a state government. It is often composed of Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard reservists, retirees and volunteers. They are distinguishable from the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary which is a federally chartered civilian volunteer component of the U.S. Coast Guard and falls under the command of the Commandant of the Coast Guard through the Chief Director of the Auxiliary, and the United States Maritime Service and United States Merchant Marine, both of which are federal maritime services.\n\nUnder Title 10 of the United States Code, naval militias are treated differently from maritime state defense force units not primarily composed of reservists from the sea services. Naval militias are considered parts of the organized militia under federal law and thus members have a slightly different status. Naval militias, though they are state armed forces, may receive federal supplies and use Navy or Marine Corps facilities available to Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve units subject to certain restrictions.\n\nLike members of the National Guard, the Navy and Marine Reservists who constitute most of the membership in naval militias serve in a dual federal and state capacity; they operate as a component of their state's military force, and are subject to be called up and deployed by the governor of their respective states during emergencies. However, when individual sailors and marines are federalized, they are relieved from their state obligations and placed under federal control until they are released from active service.\n\nSeamen and state marines belonging to naval militias who do not hold federal status may be enlisted or commissioned into the federal sea services at the rank they are qualified for, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy.\n\nIn the 1880s, a United States Navy proposal to organize a national Naval Reserve Force was submitted to the United States Congress, but the proposal was defeated. However, the movement to create a naval reserve force became popular at the state and local level. Following the passage of enabling legislation in several states, several of these states began establishing naval reserve forces. The first naval militia which was first organized and drilling was the Massachusetts Battalion, which first met on 28 February 1890. The New York Naval Militia was organized as a Provisional Naval Battalion in 1889, and formally became the second state naval militia when it was officially mustered into state service as the First Battalion, Naval Reserve Artillery, on 23 June 1891. Over the next few years, several other states, mainly in the eastern United States and in the Great Lakes region, created their own naval militias.\n\nThe United States Navy began loaning older veteran ships from the American Civil War, such as and , to state naval militias for use as armories and headquarters. On 2 March 1891, the United States Congress passed an appropriations bill which gave the Secretary of the Navy $25,000 per year to spend on the state naval militias; this money was divided among the states based on the strength levels of the naval militias.\n\nThe naval militias were called into service during the Spanish–American War. Since no law existed to call them into federal service as a unit, governors were asked to release volunteers from their state service, and these naval militiamen were inducted into the Navy for the duration of their service during the war. New York Naval Militiamen manned two auxiliary cruisers that fought in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, and conducted patrols of New York Harbor. Members of the North Carolina Naval Militia crewed and guarded the city of Port Royal, South Carolina. South Carolina Naval Militia sailors also assisted in the defense of Port Royal, and served aboard multiple ships, including , , , and . Members of the Connecticut Naval Militia served aboard USS \"Minnesota\". Sailors from both the Rhode Island Naval Militia and the Florida Naval Militia were also assimilated into the ranks of the Navy.\nIn 1914, Congress passed a bill recognizing the naval militia as a reserve component of the United States Armed Forces and reorganized them into the National Naval Volunteers. During World War I, naval militiamen were drafted into federal service. Many naval reservists, including a significant number of sailors from the Michigan Naval Militia, served in Naval Railway Battery crews on the Western Front. The primary federal responsibility of members of the naval militias was cemented by the Naval Reserve Act of 1938. In 1940, the naval militias were once again federalized to fight in World War II. Following the war, many states either did not rebuild their naval militias, or deactivated them in the years that followed.\n\nHowever, several naval militias were activated or reactivated in the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 1977, the Ohio Naval Militia was reactivated. In 1984, the Alaska Naval Militia was activated. In 1999, the New Jersey Naval Militia was reactivated after over thirty years of existing only on paper. In 2003, the South Carolina General Assembly reactivated the South Carolina Naval Militia. The New York Naval Militia is the only naval militia which has been continuously active since its creation, thereby making it the oldest naval militia.\n\nNaval militias have been deployed multiple times in recent years to assist in national security or disaster recovery operations. In 1989, the Alaska Naval Militia was deployed to assist in recovery operations after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. On September 11, 2001, the New Jersey Naval Militia and New York Naval Militia were deployed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks to aid in emergency response efforts. The New York Naval Militia provided assistance after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011; after Hurricane Sandy in 2012; and during the Buffalo lake effect snowstorm in 2014. In March 2020, the Alaska Naval Militia and the New York Naval Militia were activated to assist their respective states' efforts in combating the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Headquartered in Missoula, Montana, Adventure Cycling develops cycling routes, publishes maps, provides guided trips, and advocates for better and safer cycling in the U.S. The organization grew from a mass cross-country bicycle ride in 1976 to celebrate the U.S. Bicentennial. Adventure Cycling also publishes a magazine, \"Adventure Cyclist\".\n\nAdventure Cycling celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2016 by hosting the Montana Bicycle Celebration in Missoula, promoting events like Bike Your Park Day and Bike Travel Weekend, and publishing its first-ever coffee table book, \"America's Bicycle Route: The Story of the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail\". \n\nAdventure Cycling Association was founded in 1973 as Bikecentennial by Dan and Lys Burden and Greg and June Siple during the couples’ Hemistour bicycle ride from Anchorage, Alaska, to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. They planned Bikecentennial as a cross-country bicycle ride to celebrate the bicentennial of the United States. More than 4,100 cyclists took part in the event, riding all or part of the coast-to-coast, TransAmerica Bicycle Trail during the summer of 1976. Once the event was completed, Bikecentennial lived on as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit member organization to serve the needs of traveling cyclists, developing more bicycle routes and publishing maps. In 1974, Bikecentennial began publishing \"Bike Report\" magazine, which later became \"Adventure Cyclist\" when the organization changed its name to Adventure Cycling Association in 1993. \n\nAdventure Cycling's mission is \"to inspire and empower people to travel by bicycle.\" Its membership has grown to over 50,000 members, and its route network is one of the largest in the world, encompassing over . Adventure Cycling is also leading the development of the U.S. Bicycle Route System, which when complete will offer more than of routes for cyclists. \n\nAdventure Cycling's headquarters are located in Missoula, Montana, in the northern Rocky Mountains. Many traveling cyclists make a point of riding through Missoula, where they stop at Adventure Cycling to enjoy free ice cream, catch up on email, ask advice, and get a tour of the building. Many cyclists also have their photos taken, and some end up in Adventure Cycling's National Bicycle Touring Portrait Collection.\n\nAdventure Cycling is the largest nonprofit membership bicycling organization in North America with over 50,000 members. Individuals or families can join, as well as bike clubs and bike shops. There is also an option to join as a lifetime member. \n\n\"Adventure Cyclist\" is published nine times per year for members of Adventure Cycling Association.

{"id": "1806045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806045", "title": "Bugatti Royale", "text": "Bugatti Royale\n\nThe Bugatti Type 41, better known as the Royale, is a large luxury car built from 1927 to 1933 with a 4.3 m (169.3 in) wheelbase and 6.4 m (21 ft) overall length. It weighs approximately 3,175 kg (7,000 lb) and uses a 12.763 litre (778 cu in) straight-eight engine. For comparison, against the Rolls-Royce Phantom VII (produced from 2003 onward), the Royale is about 20% longer, and more than 25% heavier. This makes the Royale one of the largest cars in the world.\n\nEttore Bugatti planned to build twenty-five of these cars and sell them to royalty as the most luxurious car ever, but even European royalty were not buying such things during the Great Depression, and Bugatti was able to sell only three of the seven made (six still exist, one destroyed in wreck).\n\nCrafted by Ettore Bugatti, the Type 41 is said to have come about because he took exception to the comments of an English lady who compared his cars unfavourably with those of Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe engine build for the Royale had a displacement of 12.7 litres. The engine was built around a single huge block, and at approx. long x high, is one of the largest automobile engines ever made, producing . Its eight cylinders, bored to and with a stroke length of , each displaced more than the entire engine of the contemporary Type 40 touring car. It had 3 valves per cylinder (two inlet:one exhaust) driven by a centrally positioned single overhead camshaft. Three bearings and only a single custom carburettor was needed. The engine was based on an aero-engine design that had been designed for the French Air Ministry, but never produced in that configuration.\n\nThe engine block and cylinder head were cast in one unit. Grinding of the engine valves was a regular maintenance requirement, and removing the engine valves for grinding required removing and disassembling the large cast iron engine.\n\nThe chassis was understandably substantial, with a conventional semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension arrangement at the front. At the rear the forward-facing Bugatti quarter-elliptics were supplemented by a second set facing to the rear.\n\nStrangely for the modern day observer, the aluminium clutch box was attached to the chassis - not to the engine - and the gearbox (also aluminium) was attached to the rear axle which meant it was part of the unsprung mass of the suspension. The clutch and gearbox were placed at odd locations to reduce noise and increase comfort, a difficult problem in those days. The transmission was mounted at the rear to offset the weight of the engine.\n\nMassive brake shoes were mechanically operated via cable controls: the brakes were effective but without servo-assistance required significant muscle power from the driver. The car's light alloy \"Roue Royale\" wheels measured in diameter and were cast in one piece with the brake drums.\n\nReflecting some tradition-based fashions of the time, the driver was confronted by a series of knobs of whalebone, while the steering wheel was covered with walnut.\n\nA road test performed in 1926 by W. F. Bradley at the request of Ettore Bugatti for the \"Autocar\" magazine proved how exquisite chassis construction allowed very good and balanced handling at speed, similar to smaller Bugatti sports cars, despite the car's weight and size.\n\nAll Royales were individually bodied. The radiator cap was a posed elephant, a sculpture by Ettore's brother Rembrandt Bugatti.\n\nIn 1928, Ettore Bugatti asserted that \"this year King Alfonso of Spain will receive his Royale\", but the Spanish king was deposed without taking delivery of a Royale, and the first of the cars to find a customer was not delivered until 1932. The Royale with a basic chassis price of $30,000, was launched just as the world economy began to deteriorate into the 1930s Great Depression. Six Royales were built between 1929 and 1933, with just three sold to external customers. Intended for royalty, none was eventually sold to any royals, and Bugatti even refused to sell one to King Zog of Albania, claiming that \"\"the man's table manners are beyond belief!\"\"\n\nSix of seven production Royales still exist, as the prototype was destroyed in an accident in 1931, and each has a different body, some having been rebodied several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo utilize the remaining 23 engines after the final Royale was built, Bugatti built a powered by either two or four of the eight-cylinder units. Seventy-nine were built for the French National Railway SNCF, using a further 186 engines, the last of them remaining in regular use until 1956 or 1958 (sources differ). The railcar turned the Royale project from an economic failure into a commercial success for Bugatti. The engines were derated to produce only about 200 hp, but even in this form they provided excellent performance. One of the railcars took a world average speed record of for .\n\nIn light of the rarity of the Type 41 and its associated price, it is unsurprising that some replicas have been made.\n\nThe Schlumpf brothers so liked the original Dr Armand Esders coupe body on chassis 41111, using original Bugatti parts they had a replica made of the car. It now resides with the two originals they purchased at the Musée National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse.\n\nThe late Tom Wheatcroft commissioned Ashton Keynes Vintage Restorations to build an exact replica of Bugatti's personal car, the \"Coupe Napoleon\" (chassis number 41100), for his Donington Grand Prix Collection in England. It has since been sold and left the collection. So good was the replica, that when the \"Kellner\" car needed a replacement piston, its then Japanese owners commissioned South Cerney Engineering, part of AKVR, to provide a replacement.\n\nOn May 24, 2008, Prince Joachim of Denmark on the day of his wedding to Princess Marie (formerly Marie Cavallier) had Wheatcroft's replica waiting outside Møgeltønder Church to drive the newly married couple to Schackenborg Castle.\n\nThe much smaller Panther De Ville (produced between 1974 and 1985) consciously resembled the Type 41.\n\nIn 2007 to celebrate the Royale's eightieth anniversary, five of the six cars were on display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.\n\nIn the 1985 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, all six appeared together on display.\n\nA Bugatti Royale features in the 2012 book \"Lucia on Holiday\" by Guy Fraser-Sampson, an addition to the Mapp and Lucia series of novels by E.F.Benson. In the story Major Mapp-Flint is asked by a maharajah to drive the car from Paris to Bellagio, but he drives so badly and inflicts so much damage that the maharajah has the car driven into Lake Como.\n\nThe Bugatti Royale 41150 Berline de Voyage 1931 also features throughout the 2014 book \"The Eye of Zoltar\", book 3 of The Last Dragonslayer series by Jasper Fforde. The car is referenced ten times within the book. The protagonist Jennifer Strange describes her choice of car \"After looking at several I'd chosen a massive vintage car called a Bugatti Royale. Inside it was sumptuously comfortable, and outside, the bonnet was so long that in misty weather it was hard to make out the hood ornament.\"\n\nThe Bugatti Royale features in the David Grossman book \"The Zigzag Kid\"\n\nA blood-red Bugatti type 41 Royale Coupe de Ville appears in Leslie Charteris' \"Vendetta For the Saint\" (Doubleday 1964, ghostwritten by Harry Harrison) as a rental car for Simon Templar.\n\nA Bugatti Royale was featured in the Clive Cussler novel \"The Wrecker\".\n\n\"The Seventh Royale\" by Donald Stanwood is about Hitler's attempt to get a Royale and efforts to keep away from him.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1806065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806065", "title": "Swinton, Greater Manchester", "text": "Swinton, Greater Manchester\n\nSwinton is a town in Greater Manchester, England, southwest of the River Irwell, northwest of Salford and northwest of Manchester, adjoining the towns of Pendlebury and Clifton. In 2014, it had a population of 22,931.\n\nHistorically in Lancashire, for centuries Swinton was a small hamlet in the township of Worsley, parish of Eccles and hundred of Salfordshire. The name Swinton is derived from the Old English \"Swynton\" meaning \"swine town\". In the High Middle Ages, Swinton was held by the religious orders of the Knights Hospitaller and Whalley Abbey. Farming was the main industry, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.\n\nCollieries opened in the Industrial Revolution and Swinton became an important industrial area with coal providing the fuel for the cotton spinning and brickmaking industries. Bricks from Swinton were used for industrial projects including the Bridgewater Canal, which passes Swinton to the south. The adoption of the factory system facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Swinton was an important mill town and coal mining district at a convergence of factories, brickworks and a newly constructed road and railway network.\n\nFollowing the Local Government Act 1894, Swinton was united with neighbouring Pendlebury to become an urban district of Lancashire. Swinton and Pendlebury received a charter of incorporation in 1934, giving it honorific borough status. In the same year, the United Kingdom's first purpose-built intercity highway—the major A580 road (East Lancashire Road), which terminates at Swinton and Pendlebury's southern boundary—was officially opened by King George V. Swinton and Pendlebury became part of the City of Salford in 1974. Swinton has continued to grow as the seat of Salford City Council and as a commuter town, supported by its transport network and proximity to Manchester city centre.\n\nThe name Swinton derives from the Old English \"swin\", pigs and \"tun\", an enclosure, farmstead or manor estate. An early form was Swynton.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Swinton belonged to Whalley Abbey. Later, lands at Swinton were granted to Thurston Tyldesley, then of Wardley Hall. Documents record that certain areas belonged to the Knights Hospitaller.\n\nIn 1817 some Swinton weavers joined in the Blanketeers' demonstration and marched to London to put their grievances to the Prince Regent. In 1842 some Swinton people took part in Chartist agitations and tried to destroy a local colliery.\n\nSunday schools and libraries were established in Swinton at quite an early period. Swinton Industrial School was visited by Charles Dickens. The school was created by the Manchester Poor Law Union. In contrast with other institutions for the poor around that time, which were places of final resort, the Swinton Industrial School was built in response to a more enlightened attitude. The Manchester Poor Law Union saw the value of a place where children could be cared for and educated. The school opened in 1843 and survived until the 1920s. During demolition of the school buildings in the early 1930s, the foundations proved particularly difficult. Finally explosives were used, which resulted in a huge number of rats being disturbed. It was a number of weeks before council workers could remove the rats from the surrounding streets and houses. Huge nests of baby rats were carried out of the rafters of many buildings. The site was used for the present town hall.\n\nLying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Swinton anciently formed part of the hundred of Salford (civil jurisdiction). Swinton was a chapelry in the township of Worsley and ecclesiastical parish of Eccles.\n\nSwinton's first local authority was a local board of health established in 1867. A regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation, it covered Swinton itself and the majority of the neighbouring township of Pendlebury. It changed its name to Swinton and Pendlebury Local Board of Health in 1869. Following the Local Government Act 1894, Swinton became a civil parish, and the area of the local board became Swinton and Pendlebury UD, an urban district of the administrative county of Lancashire. In 1907 there were exchanges of land with the neighbouring Worsley Urban District, and in 1933 most of Clifton and a part of Prestwich Urban District were added to Swinton and Pendlebury. Swinton and Pendlebury received its Charter of Incorporation as a municipal borough from Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby at a ceremony in Victoria Park on 29 September 1934. In 1955 a very small part of Worsley Urban District was added to Swinton and Pendlebury.\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Swinton of Pendlebury was abolished, and Swinton has since 1 April 1974 formed an unparished area of the City of Salford, a metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.\n\nSwinton lies at (53.5122°, -2.3412°), northwest of central London, and west-northwest of Manchester city centre. Topographically, Swinton occupies an area of gently sloping ground, roughly above sea level, and is on the south side of the River Irwell. Swinton lies in the west-central part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the UK's second largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes Swinton on its northwest side.\n\n The architectural centrepiece of the town is the neoclassical Salford Civic Centre, which has a 125-foot (38 m) high clock tower. It was built as Swinton and Pendlebury Town Hall, when Swinton and Pendlebury received its Charter of Incorporation. Before its construction, council meetings were held in Victoria House in Victoria Park, but the borough council required larger premises. A competition was launched to design the new town hall; the winners were architects Percy Thomas and Ernest Prestwich with a design that closely resembled Swansea Guildhall. It later won the RIBA Gold Medal.\n\nThe site of the former Swinton Industrial School on Chorley Road was purchased for £12,500 and the foundation stone of the new town hall laid on 16 October 1936. The main builders were J. Gerrard's and Son of Swinton. The town hall opened on 17 September 1938. Extensions were built when it became the administrative headquarters of the City of Salford in 1974\n\nWardley Hall is an early medieval manor house and a Grade I listed building, and is the official residence of the Roman Catholic bishops of Salford.\nSwinton is served by two railway stations on the Manchester-Southport line.\nSwinton railway station is near the town centre on Station Road (B5231), just over the boundary in Pendlebury. The other station is Moorside railway station near the top of Moorside Road, close to its junction with Chorley Road (A6). Until 1974 it was known as \"Moorside and Wardley\" railway station.\n\n Swinton RLFC has an impressive record in rugby league considering the size of the town. The club's six Championship and three Challenge Cup wins is better than the record of their local rivals Salford RLFC. The club was based just over the local boundary in Pendlebury until 1992, when financial mismanagement necessitated a move from the Station Road ground to play at Gigg Lane in Bury. The financial failure of main creditor and \"de facto\" owner Hugh Eaves in 2002 put the future of the club in jeopardy and it spent a short time regrouping at Moor Lane in Kersal, as tenants of Salford City F.C.. From 2003, the Lions played home games at Park Lane, Whitefield, home of Sedgley Park RUFC. In 2006, the club acquired land to build a 6,000 capacity stadium with training facilities and community use in Agecroft, Pendlebury. After ground-sharing with Leigh and Salford, the club moved to Heywood Road, Sale, home of Sale Rugby Union F.C. for the 2016 season onwards.\n\nSwinton based junior association football side Deans F.C. was the starting point in the career of Ryan Giggs, who grew up in neighbouring Pendlebury and went on to become a Manchester United player, and also of Dean Holden.\n\n\nSt Peter's CE Primary School (\n) is a Church of England primary school located on Vicarage Road, Swinton; it is next to St Peter's Church and is a two-minute walk from Swinton Shopping Centre. The school is also located near Salford Civic Centre (formerly Swinton and Pendlebury Town Hall).\n\nSt Peter's School is split into two areas, Juniors and Infants. Like most primary schools in England, St. Peter's caters to children aged 3 to 11 (Years 1 to 6). In January 2011 the school placed 12th in the list of most popular primary schools in the city of Salford, with there being 30 places available with 40 parents listing the school as the first choice for their children leaving a surplus of 10 children. St Peter's is a feeder school for Moorside High School. At the time of the previous inspection children's skills on entry to the Nursery were below average but they have declined since then and are now well below average.\n\nSt. Peter's C. E. Primary School was not originally on the site that it now sits upon (the original 19th century school was where the Swinton Shopping Centre now stands). It was a much smaller school and therefore a much bigger building was needed. The current building started being constructed in 1905 and the work was finished in 1906. The school first opened its doors 1906 and has remained virtually unchanged ever since.\n\nThe school is subject to frequent outbreaks of vandalism and theft of outdoor and computer equipment. The school made the news in August 2016 when it was discovered that, James King, a teacher and head of year at the school had been stealing laptops and iPads to fund a gambling habit; in total he took the devices into different pawnbrokers to gain £1,620. He has since been banned from teaching indefinitely.\n\nThe school achieved:\n\nSchool productions have included Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, performed in 2001, Alice in Wonderland, performed in 2002 and Oliver!, performed in 2003. The school staged another prefromance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in 2008 to say farewell to the then Headteacher, Mrs Walker as this was the first performance she experienced at the school.\n\nNotable former pupils include:\n\n\n\nComposer Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, previously Master of the Queen's Music, was brought up in Swinton after his family moved from Salford when he was four. In 1998, he wrote \"Swinton Jig\", an orchestral work inspired by the sounds and traditional melodies heard in Swinton during his childhood.\n\nThe composer and pianist Roger Smalley was born in Swinton in 1943.\n\n\n\n"}

Initially court officials in pre-colonial kingdoms, the priyayi moved into the colonial civil service and then on to administrators of the modern Indonesian republic.\n\nThe Mataram Sultanate, an Islamic polity in south central Java that reached its peak in the 17th century, developed a \"kraton\" (\"court\") culture from which the Sultan emerged as a charismatic figure that rules over a relatively independent aristocracy. Named \"para yayi\" (\"the king’s brothers\"), nobles, officials, administrators, and chiefs were integrated in a patron-client relationship with the Sultan to preside over the peripheries of the kingdom. The homeland of priyayi culture is attributed to Mataram’s center, namely the Javanese-speaking middle and eastern parts of Java. Although \"Javanized\" by Mataram’s political expansion, the Sundanese-speaking western part of Java, the easternmost parts of Java, and the nearby island of Madura retain ethnic, linguistic, and cultural differences from the Mataramese heartland.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the collapse of Mataram, the Sultanates of Surakarta and Yogyakarta became centers of Javanese political power since the 1755 Treaty of Giyanti. Although Dutch political influence severely limited their autonomy throughout the colonial period, the two kingdoms continued to serve as symbols of Javanese courtly culture. In the lowland rural areas of Java, the presence of a centralized indigenous bureaucracy strengthened state control over uncultivated land, and helped transform the peasantry from independent smallholders to agricultural laborers.\n\nOutside of the areas ruled directly by Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Dutch colonial authorities established two civil service bodies: the \"Binnenlands Bestuur\" (\"Interior Administration\"), staffed by Dutch officials, and the \"Pangreh Praja\" (\"Ruler of the Realm\"), the indigenous bureaucracy.\n\nBy 1926, the Binnenlands Bestuur in the directly ruled areas of Java and Madura consisted of the following offices with territorial responsibilities, in descending order:\n\n\nIn turn, there were three pangreh praja offices with territorial responsibilities, staffed by the indigenous priyayi, in descending order:\n\n\nOther colonial government employees considered to be of priyayi stature included tax officials, prosecutors, and officials attached to police units. By 1931, Europeans accounted only for 10 percent of the entire state apparatus in the Dutch East Indies, and over 250,000 native officials were on state payroll. In Java, a class distinction existed between \"priyagung\" (\"upper priyayi\"), a group well connected to the aristocratic elite in Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and \"priyayi cilik\" (\"lower priyayi\"). Nonetheless, the social distance separating the priyayi from the peasantry is much greater than that separating the priyagung from the priyayi cilik.\n\nIn 1901, the Dutch East Indies government established the so-called \"Ethische Politiek\" (\"Ethical Politics\") as an official policy. The Ethical Politics paradigm extended the colonial state control through educational, religious, agricultural, resource extraction, and political surveillance institutions over the native population until Japanese occupation of 1942. Western-style education became available to the native populace, although only the wealthy could afford tuition at the secondary and tertiary institutions where Dutch is the primary language of instruction. Among the Javanese, priyayi men were the first to be educated at Western-style institutions before entering the colonial civil service.\n\nNationalistic sentiments among Javanese elites who received Dutch education were formative in the era of the Indonesian National Awakening. The Boedi Oetomo, the first indigenous political society in the Dutch East Indies, was established by a group of priyayi doctors and medical students in 1908. Although the group was confined to a Javanese, male priyayi following, the Boedi Oetomo was the first in a series of indigenous political activism in the Dutch East Indies. The Boedi Oetomo gave rise to prominent priyayi figures such as Soetatmo Soeriekosomo (1888-1924) and Noto Soeroto (1888-1951), who are advocates for ethnic nationalism through the Committee for Javanese Nationalism, as well as advocates of Indies-wide nationalism, such as Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo (1886-1943) who later founded the Indische Party. The emergence of other ethnic nationalist groups and Indies-nationalist political parties in Java later eclipsed Javanese nationalism and gave rise to the emergence of a broader, Indonesian-language nationalism throughout the 1920s and 30s.\n\nThe recognition of the Republic of Indonesia in 1949 by Dutch authorities resulted in the integration of bureaucratic institutions from Dutch-controlled federal states into the new Republic. The number of civil servants in Indonesia thus grew from 115,000 in the late 1920s to 400,000 in the early 1950s. However, the strategic top echelons were dominated by an elite group of 100,000 Dutch-trained senior officials, which were concentrated in the Ministry of the Interior. By the 1980s, Indonesia’s civil service expanded to approximately 2 million members, which amounted to 13.9 civil servants per 1,000 of the population, in contrast to the much lower 3.7 per 1,000 in 1950.\n\nAlthough the status of a priyayi does not have a formal presence in post-Independence Indonesian law, proximity to the executive branches of the state, which it symbolizes, remained a popular mode of upward socio-political mobility from the 1950s and after. The New Order government of General Soeharto encouraged traditional priyayi and corporatist value in the Indonesian civil service, especially through the establishment of the Indonesian Civil Servants' Corps (KORPRI) in 1971.\n\nThe priyayi class used elaborate title system. Some of the commonly used titles among Javanese nobility were:\n\n\nThe order of precedence for male nobility title is: a simple \"Mas\" is the lowest, followed by simple \"Raden\", and then the higher titles are compound titles of \"Raden Mas\", \"Raden Panji\", \"Raden Tumenggung\", \"Raden Ngabehi\" and \"Raden Aria\". These title were hereditary in some extents; a son will inherit a title one level lower than his parent, unless it is already of the lowest rank.\n\nThe honorific \"Raden\" is related to the Malagasy noble titles of Randriana or Andriana, both of which are derived from the word \"\"Rahadyan\"\" (Ra-hadi-an), meaning \"Lord\" or \"Master\" in Old Javanese.\n\nAmerican cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz explained two cultural oppositions in priyayi worldview that characterizes the priyayi as a social status: \"alus\" (\"refined\") against \"kasar\" (\"unrefined\"), and \"batin\" (\"inner human experience\") against \"lahir\" (\"outer human behavior\"). As a feudalistic subculture in Javanese society distinct from the peasantry, priyayi culture emphasizes the alus over the kasar, and the batin over the lahir.\n\nThe principal religion of the ethnic Javanese populace in the provinces of Central Java, East Java, and the Special Region of Yogyakarta is Islam, although there are minorities of Roman Catholic Christians, Protestant Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists. Within Javanese Islam, Geertz identified three alirans, or cultural streams: the \"abangan\", the \"santri\", and the priyayi. Members of the santri stream are more likely to be urban dwellers, and tend to be oriented to the mosque, the Qur'an, and to Islamic canon law. In contrast, the abangan tend to be from village peasant backgrounds and absorb both Hindu and Muslim elements, forming a culture of animist and folk traditions. The priyayi stream is the traditional bureaucratic elite and was strongly driven by hierarchical Hindu-Javanese tradition. The santri are sometimes referred to as \"Putihan\" (\"the white ones\") as distinct from the 'red' abangan. In general, the religion of the priyayi is closer to the abangan tradition than the santri, because of its combination of Indic polytheism and Islamic monotheism. Public rituals, such as slametan, or the communal feast, are practiced in abangan peasant and priyayi households alike.\n\nPriyayi families on the coastal center and eastern parts of the island, however emphasize genealogical ties to the \"wali sanga\", the nine Islamic saints of Java, and are closer to the santri in their religious practices than their hinterland counterparts.\n\nWhile the abangan are often peasants, the priyayi is the class of the landed gentry of towns and urban population centers. Unlike feudal landlords, however, the priyayi of the Dutch colonial period are white-collar government employees who work as bureaucrats, teachers, and clerks. The priyayi distinguish themselves from the peasantry and the merchant class by defining their work for the government as alus (\"refined\"), as opposed to trading, farming, and laboring, which are defined as kasar (\"unrefined\"). An early 19th century poem, \"Suluk Mas Nganten,\" written by Jayadiningrat I, a Surakarta courtier, describes priyayi as a charismatic power, and not just socio-economic stature, that merchants cannot achieve:\n\nPriyayi families, however, also engage in trading through informal channels. Until the 1980s, priyayi women often supplement their household income by selling homemade textiles and craftswear, although trading in public places is seen as inappropriate for upper- and middle-class priyayi women.\n\nLiteracy and command of multiple Javanese language registers were sources of priyayi prestige during the Dutch colonial era, when the majority of Java’s population were illiterate. The two major levels of discourse in the Javanese language are \"krama\" (\"formal\") and \"ngoko\" (\"informal\"). Mastery of krama, a set of registers primarily spoken up the social hierarchy, requires high levels of education. Towards the end of the 19th century, when younger cadres of priyayi received Dutch-language education, the Javanese \"inner elite\" began adopting Dutch not only as a language used at work when interacting with the Dutch, but also at home and among Javanese circles. The colonial era priyayi, therefore, became a largely bilingual class. Since independence, Indonesian has been adopted as a national language, and new styles of Indonesian and Javanese have emerged as a continuation of the krama and ngoko registers in official publications and popular literature.\n\nThe priyayi are patrons and practitioners of classical, courtly Javanese art forms, which they regard as alus and refined in contrast to the peasant art forms:\n\n\n\n"}

Though long familiar to locals (the south side of the arch is visible from the plain below) it was famously \"discovered\" in 1947 by English mountaineer Eric Shipton during his tenure as the British consul in Kashgar – and made known to the West in his book \"Mountains of Tartary\". Shipton made unsuccessful attempts to reach the arch from the south but was defeated each time by a maze of steep canyons and cliffs. The arch once figured in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" for its exceptional height, but the editors of the book could not verify the location of the arch exactly, so the listing was dropped.\n\nIt was only as recently as May 2000 that an expedition sponsored by National Geographic rediscovered the arch for the outside world. Today, several companies operating out of Kashgar offer day trips to the arch for tourists. The arch is about a one- to two-hour drive from Kashgar in addition to another one- to two-hour hike. It used to be that visitors were guided by locals and required to climb shaky ladders on their way to the arch but China has since invested money into a visitor's center, staircases and a viewing deck.\n\nThe Gobi March 2008, an international stage race, took competitors to the top of the arch during its seven-day, 250-kilometer footrace.\n\nThe height of the arch is estimated to be , about the height of the Empire State Building. The span of the arch is roughly . The \"true\" height of the arch is debatable: viewing the arch from the north (normal approach route) it appears to be tall from the top of the rubble pile; from the south side (approachable via a technical canyon ascent), the height is closer to the estimated . The height depends upon what constitutes the base of the arch, which is either the base of the rubble pile (which is partially under the arch and where the span achieves its maximum width) or the floor of the west side canyon head, lower.\n"}

Many of his students, who were all from a community of poor and immigrant families, started class very early, left late, and typically achieved high scores in standardized tests. Esquith has authored books about teaching and his annual class Shakespeare productions were featured in the 2005 documentary \"The Hobart Shakespeareans\".\n\nHis teaching honors include the 1992 Teacher of the Year, for The Walt Disney Company's American Teacher Awards, a Fellowship from Johns Hopkins University, Oprah Winfrey’s $100,000 \"Use Your Life Award\", \"Parents Magazine’s\" \"As You Grow Award\", National Medal of Arts, and Esquith was made an honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nA 1981 graduate of UCLA, Esquith began teaching in 1982 at Ivanhoe Elementary School. Two years later, he moved to Hobart, the second-largest elementary school in the United States. Most of the school's 850 students come from Central American and Korean families. According to a 2005 report on \"National Public Radio\", 90 percent of his students were living below the poverty level, and all were from immigrant families, with none speaking English as a first language.\n\nThe dynamic agenda and intensive curriculum that Esquith had previously applied at Ivanhoe proved to be challenging for his pupils at Hobart. Thus, Esquith was resolved to prove that the students of Hobart were no less capable than those anywhere else, but rather their expectations had not been set high enough.\n\nEsquith's fifth-grade students consistently score in the top 5 to 10 percent of the country in standardized tests. Many of Esquith's students voluntarily start class at 6:30 each morning, two hours before the rest of the school's students. They volunteer to come early, work through recess, stay as late as 6:00 pm, and come to class during vacations and holidays.\n\nEach April, Esquith’s students perform one of Shakespeare's plays as \"The Hobart Shakespeareans\". They have opened for the Royal Shakespeare Company, have appeared at the Globe Theater in London, were hired by Sir Peter Hall to perform \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, and were the subjects of the 2005 documentary \"The Hobart Shakespeareans\".\n\nIn March 2015 Esquith was placed on leave pending an LAUSD investigation into allegations of misconduct in his classroom. In June Esquith's lawyer Mark Geragos filed a formal complaint against the district, a precursor to a lawsuit. Geragos says that while the district has not clearly outlined the allegations against Esquith, after an \"'initial' investigation was found to be meritless, LAUSD has taken it upon itself to manufacture new ways to attempt to defame Mr. Esquith.” LAUSD superintendent Ramon Cortines has said \"there are serious issues that go beyond the initial investigation.\" LAUSD later revealed that the investigation had been expanded to include the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse of a student in the 1970s who was 8 or 9 at the time, when Esquith was a teenager and employed with an afterschool program at Westside Jewish Community Center. The alleged victim said he did not report the abuse to LAUSD until 2006, and the district then reported them to LAPD. No charges were filed at the time. In October 2015 the school board voted unanimously to fire Esquith. Documents later obtained by the Los Angeles Times via the California Public Records Act included documentation of email communications with students deemed inappropriate by LAUSD. Soon after Esquith filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit against the LAUSD on behalf of 2,000 teachers. The lawsuit came after multiple allegations claiming the school district had fired teachers on the brink of retirement in order to save money on retirement benefits. In September 2017 the Los Angeles Unified School District settled the lawsuits with Esquith for an undisclosed sum. As part of the settlement it was agreed that Esquith would receive lifetime health benefits and the satisfaction that the settlement included language intended to better protect the rights of teachers accused of wrongdoing. The settlement went on to state that, \"Mr. Esquith has tendered his resignation, effective October 31, 2015, and L.A. Unified has retroactively accepted it.\" \n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the author of several textbooks, most notably the very widely used authoritative text \"Evolutionary Biology\" (in its third edition, published 1998) and a simplified version targeted explicitly to undergraduates, \"Evolution\" (in its fourth edition, published 2017). The latter text has been positively reviewed as important to the successful teaching of evolution, though less comprehensive than the former. He has also co-edited a more advanced book composed of edited reviews, \"Coevolution\", with Montgomery Slatkin; it received mixed reviews from those in the field.\n\nFutuyma has also written for a popular audience in his book \"Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution\", originally published in 1982, in which he discusses the creation-evolution controversy. The book has been regarded as highly effective in making the argument for evolution and as a tool for discussing the topic with those who are uncertain; philosopher of biology Michael Ruse described it as \"a first-class book\". It was also reviewed as suitable for use in undergraduate education. Richard Lewontin found the book \"lucid\" but criticized its presentation, along with other books on the topic published around the same time, as failing to capture the origins of the debate as a social phenomenon.\n\nSince 2013, Futuyma has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nFutuyma is openly gay. He has said that he was initially surprised at the lack of negative career consequences, and that LGBT visibility is important to progress on gay rights. In 1984 he co-authored a scientific paper critical of the evidence available at the time that homosexuality might be genetic.\n\nFutuyma was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1985 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2006.\n\nFutuyma was selected as a Guggenheim Fellow in 1992 and as a Fulbright Fellow senior scholar in 1999, awarded for travel to the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n\nHe received the Sewall Wright Award from the American Society of Naturalists in 1997 and the Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in 2012.\n\n"}

It moved to its present location in 1872, when the building was dedicated as the Metropolitan Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1925, the Methodist Church of Canada merged with the Presbyterians and Congregationalists to form the United Church of Canada. Metropolitan then acquired its current name. The first General Council of the United Church was held there in 1925. The church was mostly destroyed by a fire in 1928, but it was rebuilt in 1929 (keeping the same design) with the help of the Methodist Massey family, of Massey Ferguson fame. In 1930, Casavant Frères installed the largest pipe organ in Canada in the newly refurbished building. The church is also known for its 54 bell carillon that is regularly heard throughout the neighbourhood.\n\nToday, the church is known for its progressiveness. It has long played an important role in Toronto's Gay and Lesbian community that is centred just to the north at Church and Wellesley. The church also offers a wide array of services for the poor and homeless.\n\nDesigned by Henry Langley, who was to draw \"the ubiquitous cloak of decorous gothicism over the face of Ontario in the 1870s\", the church became known as\n\nThe church's ecclesiastical neighbours are St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica and the Cathedral Church of St. James, and the trio of similarly designed churches are a striking Christian witness adjacent to Canada's financial hub. The church's website describes the building in customary evangelical Protestant terms, regarding the nave rather than the altar (\"communion table\") area as its \"sanctuary\".\n\nA very important part of the church is the carillon. A traditional carillon is a set of 23 or more bells which are played from a mechanical keyboard. The collection of bells at the Metropolitan United Church has been growing since April 2, 1922, when Chester D. Massey dedicated 23 bells in memory of his wife. These original 23 bells, cast by Gillett & Johnston in Croydon, England, are inscribed with the message \"May the spirit of the Lord reach the heart of every one where the sound of these bells is heard.\" In 1960, Charles W. Drury and his wife donated twelve smaller bells, and by 1971, the collection was brought to a total of 54 bells.\n\nWhen the church was first built in 1872, it was designed to accommodate a future carillon. The tower was designed to support the addition of bells and their immense weight (over forty four thousand pounds), by having seven-foot thick walls at the base which taper as they go up. At the top of the tower is a bell chamber open to the outside through which the carillon music can be heard. The church also had Canada’s largest pipe organ installed in 1930 following the fire which destroyed the previous organ. This instrument plays an important part in leading the church choir and ceremony every week. When it was first installed, there was a weekly recital which was widely known in the neighbourhood, and which received a great deal of recognition in the local papers. These two instruments, the organ and carillon, are an important part of the church’s image and are enjoyed wherever they are heard and especially by the patients of the St. Michael's Hospital.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806147", "title": "Agnatic seniority", "text": "Agnatic seniority\n\nAgnatic seniority is a patrilineal principle of inheritance where the order of succession to the throne prefers the monarch's younger brother over the monarch's own sons. A monarch's children (the next generation) succeed only after the males of the elder generation have all been exhausted. Agnatic seniority essentially excludes females of the dynasty and their descendants from the succession. Contrast agnatic primogeniture, where the king's sons stand higher in succession than his brothers. \n\nIn hereditary monarchies, particularly in more ancient times, seniority was a much-used principle of order of succession. The Ottoman Empire evolved from an elective succession (following the principle of agnatic seniority) to a succession inherited by the law of agnatic seniority.\n\nIn succession based on rotation (close to seniority), all (male) members of the dynasty were entitled to the monarchy, in principle. However, this tends to lead to situations where there is no clear rule to determine who is the next monarch.\n\nBrothers succeeding each other as a system leads quickly, particularly in the following generations, to complex patterns and also to disputes between branches which have formed within the monarchical house.\n\nMonarchs had collateral relatives, some of whom were rather distant cousins, who were often as entitled to succeed as the monarch himself. Either one branch obtained sufficient control over others (often by force), the rival branches arrived at a balance (such as the succession becoming rotational), or the inheritance was somehow partitioned.\n\nSuccession based on agnatic seniority or rotation was often limited to those princes who were sons of an earlier reigning monarch. Thus a son of a king had a higher claim than a son of a prince. In some cases, distinctions were even made based on whether the claimant was born to a monarch who reigned at the time of birth (porphyrogeniture).\n\nThis limit was practical, as otherwise the number of rivals would be overwhelming. However, it usually left more than one rival who too often waged civil war against each other. In other cases, the eligible branches of dynasty became extinct in the male line (no surviving sons), in which situation the limit was problematic.\n\nSons of princes who did not live long enough to succeed to the throne were unsatisfied with such limits. This led to interpretation problems: What if a claimant's father was a rightful monarch, but not recognized by everyone, or by no one (did not rule at all)? The cases were further complicated by co-reigning monarchs, but this was often a practical solution to a controversial succession.\n\nAgnatic seniority tends in the long run to favor a sort of ultimogeniture, because princes born in a certain generation to the most junior lines tend to be more likely alive at the demise of the predecessor (the last of the immediately preceding generation). In a situation where representatives from any later generation are not allowed to succeed until the last ones of the earlier generation die, plenty of dynasts, usually from more senior branches, will die before their turn on the throne. This tendency is one of the causes of disputed successions: some desire to succeed before they die, and plead the seniority or better blood of their branch. This is further exacerbated if a dynast is not allowed to succeed in case his father was not regnant (or is regarded just as a spare, eligible to succeed only after all those males whose fathers were regnant)—senior branches will with high likelihood sooner or later lose their places in succession. Agnatic seniority tends to favour boys who are born to fathers in their old age.\n\nSuccession within one family based on seniority was often a device to control an elective monarchy. Those two forms of monarchy (agnatic seniority and elective monarchy) were mostly used in the same centuries. Many kingdoms were officially elective long into historical times (though the election usually, or always, fell to family of the deceased monarch).\n\nThe preference for males which exists in most systems of hereditary succession came mostly from the perceived nature of the role of the monarch:\n\n\nIn earlier centuries, perhaps in every second or every third generation on average, the male line often became extinct and females were needed to trace the line of succession. During this period, male lines tended to become extinct relatively quickly, usually due to violent death. Therefore, \"pure\" agnatic succession was impossible to maintain, and frequent exceptions were made—eligibility being granted to the eldest sons of sisters or other female relatives of the monarch.\n\nThe fully agnatic succession also did not serve the interests of individual monarchs who favoured close female relatives and their descendants over very distant male relatives.\n\nIn the later Middle Ages, violence directly involving the monarch and his heirs became less of a factor, as they gradually decreased their personal participation in combat. Sons were much more likely to survive to adulthood and to marry than in previous centuries, when many noble families lost adolescent sons to constant warfare. In addition, the living conditions and nutrition of the nobility improved, leading to fewer miscarriages and decreased infant and childhood mortality. Daughters were therefore needed less and less to trace succession.\n\nIn many cultures, surnames are agnatically determined.\n\nAgnatic seniority and the rota system has been used in several historical monarchies. It was practiced by the Shang dynasty and the enfeoffed Shang survivors who ruled Song under the Zhou in China. In Kievan Rus' during the Rurikid Dynasty, it was implemented by Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise (1019–1054). In the Piast Kingdom of Poland, the Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth enacted in 1138 with the establishment of a Seniorate Province at Kraków led to a centuries-long period of fragmentation of the country among his descendants. In Moravia and Bohemia since 1055 to 1182 respective 1203, established by duke Bretislaus I in his seniority \"constitution\". It was sometimes used in Morocco by the Alaouite dynasty until it was definitely abolished by King Mohammed V (1957–1961) who introduced agnatic primogeniture.\n\nThe principle is currently used by the House of Saud, the royal family of Saudi Arabia; all successors to Ibn Saud as King of Saudi Arabia have been his sons (he had 37 sons). Currently, as all remaining first-generation candidates are in their 70s and 80s, the Allegiance Council has been instituted to smooth the transition of power to the grandsons of Ibn Saud. The institution of the Allegiance Council arguably makes the succession formally elective, but seniority remains the overriding factor, and it is expected that the most-senior dynast will be elected unless he is uninterested in the throne or otherwise disqualified.\n\nIn the succession for the Emperor of Ethiopia, limitation to agnates was controlled until recent times. According to research by the historian Taddesse Tamrat, the order of succession during the Zagwe dynasty was that of brother succeeding brother as King of Ethiopia (i.e., agnatic seniority), which apparently was based on Agaw laws of inheritance. However, the principle of agnatic primogeniture later became dominant, although succession to the throne at the death of the monarch could be claimed by any male blood relative of the Emperor—sons, brothers, uncles or cousins. To avoid instability and civil war, an Emperor typically took care to designate his chosen heir, and to strengthen the heir's position against rivals. In addition, the Emperor would place the heir's rivals in a secure location, which drastically limited their ability to disrupt the Empire with revolts, or to dispute the succession of an heir apparent. Over time, Emperors were more frequently selected by a council of the senior officials of the realm, both secular and religious. The Ethiopian experience is a particularly good example of the instability which can result from the application of the principle of agnatic seniority.\n\nThe County of Anjou followed inheritance by agnatic seniority. When Henry II of England married Eleanor of Aquitaine, creating the Angevin Empire, this resulted in some question over what inheritance laws would affect their children, as Henry II's father was the count of Anjou, and he inherited England and Normandy through his mother. Henry II's eldest son the Young Henry died before him, so the throne passed to his next oldest son, Richard I of England. Henry II's third son Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany died three years before his father, but his pregnant wife later gave birth to a son, Arthur of Brittany. When Richard was mortally wounded during a castle siege, on his deathbed he named his brother John, Henry II's fourth and youngest son, as his heir. However, the inheritance was questioned by the young Arthur of Brittany (then 12 years old). Arthur argued that as the son of John's older brother Geoffrey, he was the rightful heir of Richard and Henry II according to the laws of agnatic primogeniture which were followed in England and Normandy. John countered that as the male-line heirs of the Counts of Anjou, the Angevin Empire followed the succession law of Anjou which was based on agnatic seniority. Thus, John claimed that as Richard's younger brother, he stood in line ahead of his nephew. Arthur continued to press his claim for the next four years, allying with the king of France against John, though Richard's deathbed declaration of John as his heir provided greater strength to his claim. Ultimately Arthur was captured in battle, imprisoned, and presumably killed by John. The matter was never definitively decided, as John lost all continental land possessions in France and had to relinquish any claim to rule of Anjou.\n\n"}

Their relative ubiquity and numbers, combined with their styling caused them to sometimes receive the appellation of being a Molsheim Buick.\n\nThe Type 46 used a 5.4 L (5359 cc/327 in³) straight-8 engine with 3 valves per cylinder driven by a single overhead camshaft. Power was reported at 140 hp (104 kW). The engine was undersquare like most Bugatti designs with an 81 mm bore and 130 mm stroke.\n\nThe Type 46 was a large car, weighing 2500 lb (1134 kg) and riding on a 138 in (3505 mm) wheelbase. 400 examples were produced from the end of 1929 through 1936. The three speed gearbox was in unit with the live rear axle, resulting in high unsprung weight, and a relatively harsh ride. Despite this, the model was a favourite of Le Patron, and it remained in production longer than might have been expected\n\nA supercharged version, the Type 46S, was introduced in 1930. With just 160 hp (119 kW), from its Rootes-type blower, it was not a great success. 18 supercharged cars were made in all.\n\nThe Type 50 was a sporting coupe version of the Type 46.

This engine had squarer dimensions, however, at 86 by 107 mm, and twin camshafts actuated two valves per cylinder. Power output was impressive at 225 hp (167 kW). Many cars had landaulet roofs and Bugatti-style two-tone paint.\n\nThe Type 50 Touring was a sedan version of the Type 50.

Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown describe calm technology as \"that which informs but doesn't demand our focus or attention.\"\n\nThe use of calm technology is paired with ubiquitous computing as a way to minimize the perceptible invasiveness of computers in everyday life.\n\nFor a technology to be considered calm technology, there are three core principles it should adhere to:\n\nThe phrase \"calm technology\" was first published in the article \"Designing Calm Technology\", written by Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown in 1995. The concept had developed amongst researchers at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in addition to the concept of ubiquitous computing.\n\nWeiser introduced the concept of calm technology by using an example of LiveWire or \"Dangling String\". It is an string connected to the mounted small electric motor in the ceiling. The motor is connected to a nearby Ethernet cable. When a bit of information flows through that Ethernet cable, it causes a twitch of the motor. The more the information flows, the motor runs faster, thus creating the string to dangle or whirl depending on how much network traffic is. It has aesthetic appeal; it provides a visualization of network traffic but without being obtrusive.\n\nVideo conferences are an example of calm technology. Information conveyed such as through gestures and facial expressions can be gathered, as opposed to telephone conferences which do not provide this peripheral information.\n\nSmart homes are an extension of calm technology due to their emphasis on awareness and adaptability to the user's needs.\n\nFrom 2001-2003, the EU funded 17 projects under an initiative called \"The Disappearing Computer.\" The goal of this initiative was to explore new concepts and techniques that would lead to the development of calm technologies for people-friendly environments.\n\nDue to mobile technology trends towards pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, and miniaturization, calm technology is becoming a more integral part of these devices.\n\nAnother development of calm technology is its transformation into unattended technology, where the technology always exists in the periphery and never requires central attention from the user.\n\n"}

{"id": "1806188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806188", "title": "Fuendetodos", "text": "Fuendetodos\n\nFuendetodos is a town in the Campo de Belchite comarca (county), in Aragon, Spain, located about 44 kilometers south-east of Zaragoza. As of 2011, it had a population of approximately 178.\n\nThe town is associated with painter Francisco de Goya, who was born in Fuendetodos in 1746, and contains a museum dedicated to his work. The town has nearly 25,000 visitors each year.\n\nFuendetodos is located in the Aragonese comarca of Campo de Belchite, 44 km to the south of Zaragoza. \n\nIt had a population of 178 according to the census of 2011. As of 1 January 2015, the population was estimated to be 144.\n\nThe town was originally called \"Fuentedetodos\" meaning \"source of all.\" Before its foundation in the 12th century as a recolonized village associated with a castle, it was known for its quarries of \"caracoleña\" stone. This had already been exploited by the Romans who used it in many buildings constructed in nearby Caesaraugusta. From the 14th century, the village was part of the domain of the family of Fernandez de Heredia, known as the Count of Fuentes.\n\nDuring the Little Ice Age, the traditional industry of ice production flourished. \n\nIn 1724, the stones of the ruined castle were used to construct the new Church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. Goya was baptised there. He was born in Fuendetodos almost by chance, since his parents were living in Saragossa at that time. His mother was from Fuendetodos and his father was entrusted with the work of gilding the main altarpiece of the new church. He brought along his pregnant wife and they stayed in the town for several months during which time the painter was born. When Goya was born, the Pignatelly family held the title of Count of Fuentes. They provided support for the young artist who made one of his first paintimgs in Fuendetodos, in the sacristy cupboard. Goya also came to take refuge in Fuendetodos during the Second Siege of Zaragoza in 1809, since he was there making sketches to paint the destruction caused by Napoleonic troops.\n\nIn the 1920s, another Spanish painter, Ignacio Zuloaga y Zabaleta, came to know his idol's birthplace. He found Goya's birth house, bought it, and transformed it into a museum. He came back repeatedly, also helping the town with the donation of a new school.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Fuendetodos passed from rebel hands to those of the republicans with the arrival of an anarchist column. The church, being a resistance stronghold, was burnt by the troops, and the altarpiece and Goya's other paintings there were destroyed. Also Goya's birth house was looted and many pieces of the original furniture were lost. Goya's birth house remained a humble tourist place until its renovation in late 1980s, with the arrival Joaquín Gimeno as mayor of the town. From the 1990s to the present, promotion of his home has turned it into a significant tourist destination.\n\nThe population was traditionally engaged in rainfed agriculture and rearing sheep and goats. For centuries, the stone quarries (caracoleña), exclusive to Fuendetodos, and the ice industry were important economic activities. It had 22 neverones (ice refrigerators) and ice was sold mainly in the market of Zaragoza providing significant revenues to the people. Today its wind power production, and the services associated with tourism (there are 20,000 visitors annually) have become more important.\n\nMuch of the town is covered with the Alepo pine (Pinus halepensis). These had belonged the Counts of Fuentes for centuries, but were later grown on municipal property. Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) dot the hills. Romeral, the Mediterranean scrub, with plenty of black juniper (Juniperus indica), lavender, sage, and other sclerophyllous shrubs, share the territory with kermes oak. There are deep gorges carved into the hard limestone of the Jurassic era caused by glacial runoff. These gorges harbor a surprising variety of flora given Fuendetodos' dry environment including: deciduous forests of hackberry, Montpellier maple, turpentine tree can be found as well as five species of fern.\n\nThe birthplace of the great Spanish painter was built in the early 18th century. A few meters away is the Engraving Museum, opened in 1989, which displays Goya's graphic work including a permanent collection of his work from the series \"Los Desastres\", \"Los Caprichos\", \"Los Disparates\", and \"La Tauromaquia\" as well as materials related to printmaking techniques.\n\nThe Fuendeverde Nature Space, opened in June 2010, is dedicated to raising awareness of the rich biodiversity of the flora and fauna of Fuendetodos, and the richness and variety of habitats found in the natural environment of the municipality. There is a nature centre with a permanent exhibition and a nature school for workshops in a restored, former farm house constructed over the remains of the castle. There are also guided tours available to surrounding natural hot spots.\n\n\"Neveras\" or \"neverones\" are stone constructions used for snow storage in winter. This was then transformed into ice blocks to be sold. The ice production industry flourished during the Little Ice Age, reaching its peak in the 18th century. During that period there were 22 working \"neveras\" producing ice for the markets in Saragossa. Its construction style is particular to this area, with a 6 m deep and 6m wide pit over which a false cupule was constructed and topped with a specially shaped big stone. Remains of \"neveras\" are scattered all around Fuendetodos. \"Nevera de la Culroya\" is the only completely preserved example. \n\nThe church was built in the 18th century, but had to be rebuilt in the 20th century after it was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The baptismal font, where Goya was baptized, is still preserved in the church. Before the war, there were paintings in the Sacristy cupboard Goya produced when he was young and the baroque altarpiece gilded by his father. When it was constructed it was the church for the wealthy families, since there was another, smaller church in the \"El Calvario\" neighbourhood; only some remnants of this church remain.\n\nIn Fuendetodos there are two sculptures dedicated to the painter.

Used as an insult, \"your mother ...\" preys on widespread sentiments of filial piety, making the insult particularly and globally offensive. \"Your mother\" can be combined with most types of insults, although suggestions of promiscuity are particularly common. Insults based on obesity, height, hairiness, laziness, incest, age, race, poverty, poor hygiene, unattractiveness, homosexuality, or stupidity may also be used. Compared to other types of insults, \"your mother\" insults are especially likely to incite violence. Slang variants such as \"yo mama\", \"yo momma\", \"yer ma\", \"ya mum\", \"ur mom\", \"your mum\", \"ur mum\", “joe mama”, or \"your mom\" are sometimes used, depending on the local dialect. Insults involving \"your mother\" are commonly used when playing the Dozens.\n\nAlthough the phrase has a long history of including a description portion, such as the old \"your mother wears combat boots\", the phrase \"yo mama\" by itself, without any qualifiers, has become commonly used as an all-purpose insult or an expression of defiance.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare used such a device in Act I Scene 1 of \"Timon of Athens\", implying that a character's mother is a \"bitch\":\nAlso in Act IV, Scene II of \"Titus Andronicus\", Aaron taunts his lover's sons:\n"}

The park, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi (flanking the Mississippi River), also commemorates the greater Vicksburg Campaign which led up to the battle. Reconstructed forts and trenches evoke memories of the 47-day siege that ended in the surrender of the city. Victory here and at Port Hudson, farther south in Louisiana, gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.\n\nThe park includes 1,325 historic monuments and markers, of historic trenches and earthworks, a tour road, a walking trail, two antebellum homes, 144 emplaced cannons, the restored gunboat USS \"Cairo\" (sunk on December 12, 1862, on the Yazoo River), and the Grant's Canal site, where the Union Army attempted to build a canal to let their ships bypass Confederate artillery fire.\n\nThe \"Cairo\", also known as the \"Hardluck Ironclad,\" was the first U.S. ship in history to be sunk by a torpedo/mine. It was recovered from the Yazoo in 1964.\n\nThe Illinois State Memorial has 47 steps, one for every day Vicksburg was besieged.\n\n\nThe Vicksburg National Cemetery, is within the park. It has 18,244 interments (12,954 unidentified).\n\nThe time period for Civil War interments was 1866 to 1874. The cemetery is not open to new interments.\nThe cemetery has only one airman of Royal Australian Air Force buried during World War II.\n\nThe remnants of Grant's Canal, a detached section of the military park, are located across from Vicksburg near Delta, Louisiana. Union Army Major General Ulysses S. Grant ordered the project, started on June 27, 1862, as part of his Vicksburg Campaign, with two goals in mind. The first was to alter the course of the Mississippi River in order to bypass the Confederate guns at Vicksburg. For various technical reasons the project failed to meet this goal. The river did change course by itself on April 26, 1876. The project met its second goal, keeping troops occupied during the laborious maneuvering required to begin the Battle of Vicksburg.\n\nThe national military park was established on February 21, 1899, to \"commemorate the siege and defense of Vicksburg\". The park sprawls over of land. The park and cemetery were transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service (NPS) on August 10, 1933. Of the park's 1,736.47 acres (not including the cemetery), are federally owned.\n\nIn the late 1950s, a portion of the park was transferred to the city as a local park in exchange for closing local roads running through the remainder of the park. It also allowed for the construction of Interstate 20. The monuments in land transferred to the city are still maintained by the NPS. As with all historic areas administered by the NPS, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

M. Harty, Archbishop of Cashel.\n\nThe attendance at its first match was at least 20,000, reputed to have been 28,000. Within one year, the new Killarney stadium was to host the All-Ireland Hurling Final between Tipperary and Kilkenny due to the unavailability of Croke Park because of the construction of the first Cusack Stand. The capacity of the ground was severely tested in 1950 when the stadium, unusually, hosted the Munster hurling final between Cork and Tipperary, when an estimated crowd of 50,000 turned up and in the closing stages large numbers of Cork supporters encroached on the pitch, making life difficult for Tipperary goalkeeper, Tony Reddan. The claustrophobic atmosphere prompted ace Tipperary defender, John Doyle to remark that it was the first time he hurled in the midst of about 5,000.\n\nFurther developments took place at the stadium in the 1970s with the erection of the Dr. O’Sullivan stand and a pavilion. All of this raised the capacity to 39,120. This stadium is regarded as one of the finest outside of Croke Park, situated under the gaze of the picturesque Kerry mountains.\n\nThe Stadium Committee has plans to redevelop both ends of the ground to the standard of the Michael O’Connor Terrace incorporating new dressing rooms and covered areas, to eventually increase the capacity of the ground to 50,000.\n\nIn the winter of 2008/2009 the first phase in the redevelopment was finished. Among the changes are the following:\n\n\nThere are 3 levels in all underneath the new Terrace. Level 1 has the dressing rooms and shops at the rear of the terrace. Level 2 has very spacious meeting rooms for Stewards, Gardaí, Drug Testing and a Press Room for post-match interviews which has a stairway direct to dressing room area. The top level, accessed by lift or stairs, is made up of a Control Tower for crowd control and monitoring and there is also a spacious room overlooking the pitch for TV match analysis. The main entrance area from Lewis Rd has been extended with facilities for selling match tickets on match day. On the stand side, there are new entrance/exit stairs at the scoreboard end of the stand. New wheelchair facilities are located in the stand with lift access. There is a new seating area for substitutes/mentors in the stand adjacent to the VIP area in the middle of the stand. The pitch itself is in absolute pristine condition following a six-month break from playing activity. All entrance areas adjacent to the new terracing have been tarmacked. The next phase of development will consist of new terracing at the scoreboard end.\n\nOn November 15, 2016, Fitzgerald Stadium was announced as one of 12 possible venues in Ireland to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup\n\n\n\n"}

During his tenure Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope, when he moved the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria to Saint Mary's The Hanging Church in Cairo.\n\nInfighting between the Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church and the El Muallaqa Church broke out due to the wishes of that patriarch's desire to be consecrated in the Hanging Church, a ceremony that traditionally took place at Saints Sergius and Bacchus.\n\nPope Christodoulos was the one who ordered that the Copts should standardize on the Bohairic Dialect, which was the dialect of parts of Northern Egypt and the monasteries of the Scetes. This was the dialect that was starting to weaken and give way to Arabic. His intention was to strengthen the weakening Coptic. However, he inadvertently helped weaken the Coptic further in the region where it was still going strong, the Sahidic region (Upper Egypt). It is not unexpected that Sahidic Coptic survived to the 15th and 16th century. We know of an Italian visitor to Upper Egypt in the 17th century who wrote that he met a Coptic priest and an old woman who could still speak Coptic\n\nThe Patriarchs of Antioch and the Pope of Alexandria had for many years kept in close touch with one another. More than once their relations were strained, as happened particularly in the time of Patriarch John IX bar Shushan, and Christodulus, when they fell out over the proper presentation of the Eucharistic oblations, in which the Lyrian Jacobites were in the habit of mingling a little oil and salt (Neale, \"Patriarchate of Alexandria\", II, 214). Christodulus insultingly rejected the practice, and John of Antioch wrote in its defence. In 1169 a new controversy, about the use of auricular confession severed the once friendly relations between the two communions.\n\nFollowing the death of the \"Abuna\" of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Emperor of Ethiopia sent an embassy asking Pope Christodoulos to ordain a new one. He replied that he was unable to ordain one due to persecution against the Christians in Egypt at the time. As a result, an adventurer named Abdun took advantage of this interregnum and presented himself to the Ethiopian Emperor with forged documents, claiming to be the newly appointed \"Abuna\".\n"}

R. (1973) A list of the type-specimens of Parnassius (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) in the British Museum (Natural History). \"Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History) Entomology\" 29 (1) (9.XI.1973): 1—35, 1 pl. online here\n\nThis typically mountain species prefers hills and flowery alpine meadows and pastures of the continental European mountains, in Spain, Scandinavia and Central Europe, in the Balkans up to northern Greece and in the Alps between Italy and France.\n\nIt is also present in some areas of the central Asia (Sakha). Typical of high altitudes, its range is from up to , although it is far more present above .\n\nThis species requires specific climatic conditions (cold winter, sunny summer). It also requires wide open spaces (with a cover of shrubs less than 5%) and a large surface of lawns (at least 50%). The presence of the host plant for the caterpillars is critical.\n\n\"Parnassius apollo\" has a wingspan of in males, of in females. The Apollo butterfly shows a great deal of individual variation in the appearance, with an evident colour polymorphism. These very very large, beautiful and conspicuous white butterflies are decorated with five large black eyespots on the forewing and two bright red or sometimes orange eyespots on the hindwing. These striking red eyespots can vary in size and form depending on the location of the Apollo butterfly, and the bright red colour often fades in the sun, causing the eyespots of older individuals to appear more orange. The wings are shiny, with slightly transparent edges, and some individuals are darker (sphragismelanistic); a general phenomenon common in many butterflies. The caterpillars of this species are velvety black with orange-red spots along the sides.\n\nRelated species can be found all over the world. The clouded Apollo (\"Parnassius mnemosyne\") lives in the valleys. while the small Apollo (\"Parnassius phoebus\") is found in the high mountains. The latter one has strongly marked black and white antennae, with presence of two red spots near the apex of forewings.\n\nThe drastic climate change of the Pleistocene era forced a separation of the red Apollo butterfly population. This in turn played a role in creating the distinct colour changes seen in the species. The \"Parnassius apollo\" became divided and isolated in the Eurasian region during the glacial period. The large glaciers created a physical barrier between the population, barring interaction between the groups. Still within these isolated populations the butterflies migrated westward into portions of southern Europe where they settled and reproduced. Within all of these particular isolated populations there is also variation in the wing colour allele.\nThere is variation in size between the isolated populations. With the larger separated populations of butterflies these habitats are used to sustain populations with larger amount of resources. These larger populations are called metapopulations and with the smaller separated sub-populations they create a mainland-island system. The \"Parnassius apollo\" can migrate from habitats and thus create a variation seen in each isolated population.\n\nNew environmental pressures lead to the selection of a better suited colour variant within these isolated populations. With this variety there is a correlation with extinction. In high variation environments there is cause for extinction in greater numbers of individuals. For example, there is high variation in the Swiss Alps and presently there is a high rate of individuals becoming extinct. \nOne of the probable causes of extinction is the warming of the climate. It is said that the red Apollo is an \"atypical glacial invader\" and that with the warming of the climate in mountainous regions is causing the butterfly to not readily adapt to such an uncomfortable environment.\nAnother possible cause of extinction is the interesting connection between nectar plant distribution and the \"Parnassius apollo\". If there was present a constraint of migration from nectar plant populations to another the red Apollo's population would slowly dissipate and reproduction might seize. This is because the outcrop of the nectar plants are the sight of reproduction and if the spatial structure is too far for the butterfly to migrate to the dynamics of the population is in danger.\n\nThis species has a single brood. Adult Apollo butterflies are seen on the wing from May to September, feeding on nectar produced by flowers. During mating males deposit on the female's abdomen a gelatinous secretion called sphragis, that prevents the female mating a second time. The females lay eggs, which over-winter and hatch in spring the following year. The Apollo caterpillar a velvety blue black with small orange spots. These caterpillars feed on stonecrop (\"Sedum\" species, mainly \"Sedum telephium\", \"Sedum album\", \"Sedum rupestre\" and \"Sedum ropsea\"), \"Hylotelephium caucasicum\" and houseleek (\"Sempervivum\" species). When the caterpillar is fully grown it will pupate on the ground, forming a loose cocoon from which the adult butterfly emerges following metamorphosis.\n\nThe Apollo butterfly shares a variety of defensive strategies with quite a few species of butterflies. Even from a young age larva exhibit camouflage by being entirely black. This solid colour helps them avoid detection even at a close distance. However, as they mature, they lose this advantage by developing two rows of orange dots. These dots greatly decrease the amount of crypsis. In addition to this larval camouflage, the larva also shares in a form of Müllerian mimicry with a type of millipede, \"Glomeris (Glomeris guttata\"). Both insects share the characteristic orange spots and black body and a common habitat. The millipedes and caterpillars secrete a foul smelling odour to repel predators.\n\nOnce the butterfly completes its metamorphosis, it has a number of defensive mechanisms in place to avoid predation. One of the most easily identifiable traits is the bright eyespots found on the wings. These eyespots are essentially concentric circle of a wide variety of colours. Apart from the wide range of colours, eyespots are very limited in their plasticity. There are three main hypothesis to why these spots may have developed; they resemble the eyes of an enemy of the predator in order to intimidate them, they draw the attention of the predator to less vital components of the butterfly's body, or the spots are there simply to surprise the predator. The only disadvantage to these spots is that they cause the butterfly to be a great deal more conspicuous.\n\nAnother form of defence is the taste of the butterfly. Similar to the monarch butterfly, the Apollo butterfly produces a repulsive taste to its predator. The butterfly seems to get this foul taste from its plant host, the \"Sedum stenopetalum\". There is a bitter tasting cyanoglucoside, sarmentonsin, which is found in both the butterfly and the plant. There is a much higher concentration of sarmentonsin in the wings as opposed to the rest of the body. The high concentration in the wings indicates that the wings of the butterfly would taste much worse comparatively. A common predator, nesting water pipits, have evolved a strategy to avoid the poor taste of the butterfly; the bird will remove the wings before consuming the body. In theory, this will get rid of the poor tasting elements of the butterfly, leaving only the nutritious body.\n\nThis species is of interest to entomologists due to the variety of subspecies, often only restricted to a specific valley in the Alps. The beautiful Apollo butterfly has long been prized by collectors, who aim to possess as many of the variants as possible. While over-collecting is believed to have caused populations to decline in some areas, such as in Spain and Italy, habitat change is thought to be a far more significant threat to this species' survival. Plantations of conifers, the succession of suitable habitat to scrubland, agriculture, and urbanization have all reduced the habitat of the Apollo butterfly. Climate change and acid rain have also been implicated in this species decline in Fennoscandia. In addition, motor vehicles have been cited as a cause of Apollo butterfly mortalities; vehicles on a motorway system near Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy, are said to have nearly wiped out a race of the Apollo.\n\nIn Finland, the Apollo was one of the first species of insects declared endangered. The Apollo population in Finland and Sweden decreased drastically during the 1950s. The reason for this is not known, but it is commonly thought to be because of a disease. In Sweden, it is now restricted to areas that have limestone in the ground, suggesting that the decrease could hypothetically be related to acid rain.\n\nLaws exist to protect the Apollo butterfly in many countries. The Apollo is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, in Appendix II in CITES, and is mentioned in annex IV of Habitats Directive. It is protected in other states: the Principality of Liechtenstein, Czech Republic (as critically threatened species in Czech code, Decree for implementation, No. 395/1992 Sb., and No. 175/2006 Sb.), Turkey and Poland.\n\nHowever, these laws focus on the protection of individuals, rather than their habitat, and so may do little to mitigate the greatest threat that populations face. Fortunately, there are a number of projects specifically working to save this vulnerable insect. A conservation programme in Pieniny National Park saved a subspecies of the Apollo butterfly that had declined to just 20 individuals in the early 1990s, through a combination of captive breeding and habitat protection. In south-west Germany, conservationists are working with shepherds to ensure favourable conditions for the butterflies, which share their grassland habitat with sheep. For example, grazing periods have been shifted to avoid the Apollo butterfly larvae stage, which is vulnerable to being trampled.\n\nThe Apollo butterfly has many subspecies around the world, and some European subspecies are showing an alarming decline in numbers. This is mainly caused by habitat destruction, air pollution affecting the insect's food plants, and butterfly collectors. The Apollo butterfly is also more vulnerable to predators as it spends two years as a caterpillar.\n\n\n"}

Licensed to serve San Diego, California, KFMB carries a talk radio format. Owned by Local Media San Diego with a pending sale to iHeartMedia, Inc., KFMB serves San Diego County.\n\nSigning on in 1941, KFMB picked up its present talk radio format in 1994 after many years as a music station. Throughout its history, KFMB featured hosts and personalities including Geoff Edwards, Bobby Rich, Ted Leitner, Rick Roberts, and Roger Hedgecock. From the 1970s to 2000s, KFMB was the radio home of various San Diego sports teams, namely the San Diego Chargers, San Diego Padres, and San Diego State Aztecs. Today, KFMB features conservative talk shows both local and national, with \"Armstrong & Getty\" and \"The Mark Levin Show\" among its nationally syndicated programming.\n\nFrom 1964 to 2018, KFMB was part of a trio of AM, FM, and TV stations with the call sign co-owned by Midwest Television. In 2018, Tegna Inc. bought the KFMB radio and TV stations. In 2020, the radio stations were sold to Local Media San Diego, which then sold the AM station to iHeartMedia.\n\nIn 1940, the Worcester Broadcasting Corporation obtained a construction permit for a 250-watt radio station. Its president, Warren Burnham Worcester, was an aircraft designer and engineer from a prominent family in Worcester, Massachusetts. Worcester Broadcasting's station had call sign KFMB named after Worcsster's children: the \"M\" for daughter Mary and \"B\" for son Burnham. The FCC construction permit was for 1420 kHz. By the time the station signed on, all stations on 1420 kHz had moved to 1450 kHz as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement.\n\nWith a transmitter on the top of the Spreckels Building, KFMB debuted at 8 p.m. on August 19, 1941, broadcasting out of studios at the corner of Pacific Highway and Ash Street, then known as Pacific Square. KFMB's opening night featured classical music and opera performances and the United States Marine Band. KFMB would continue with what Worcester called \"the finest classical and semi-classical groups, vocalists, and the greatest name bands in the country.\"\n\nFollowing a brief illness, Warren B. Worcester died on October 24, 1942, at age 33. In July 1943, the trustees of Worcester's estate sold KFMB for $95,000 to its general manager, Jack O. Gross and a business partner, O.L. Taylor; KFMB would join the NBC Blue Network that September. The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of KFMB to Gross and Taylor in November. Gross purchased Taylor's 50 percent interest and became sole owner on June 12, 1945. \n\nIn 1947, KFMB moved from the NBC Blue Network to ABC Radio. Under Gross's stewardship, KFMB pioneered FM and television service in San Diego, launching KFMB-FM on 101.5 MHz in April 1947 and KFMB-TV on channel 8 in May 1949. On March 30, 1948, KFMB-AM moved from 1450 to 550 kHz and increased its power from 250 to 1,000 watts. The first KFMB-FM went off the air in 1950.\nIn November 1950, Gross sold the KFMB stations to John A. Kennedy, a former publisher of the \"San Diego Daily Journal\". Three years later, Kennedy sold the trio to a partnership of television producer Jack Wrather and industry executive Helen Alvarez.\n\nOn December 7, 1954, KFMB moved from 550 to 540 kHz.\n\nIn 1957 Alvarez sold her shares in KFMB to Wrather, who then sold his broadcast interests to Buffalo, New York-based Transcontinent Television Corporation in early 1959. A second KFMB-FM station signed on in 1959 on its present frequency of 100.7 MHz. Also in 1959, Geoff Edwards joined KFMB as a host.\n\nAs part of Transcontinent's exit from broadcasting, KFMB-AM-FM-TV was sold in 1964 to Midwest Television, controlled by the Meyer family and then based in Champaign, Illinois. From 1964 to 1975, KFMB had a full service format combining music, news, and sports. KFMB moved to its current position at 760 kHz on December 29, 1965. This frequency changed after a realignment of broadcast channels between the United States and Mexico forced the station to vacate 540 AM. At the time, the latter became a new clear channel frequency allocated to Mexico, and the FCC granted 760 AM as a replacement, although limited to 5 kW full-time (the FCC had earlier assigned KGU in Honolulu to 760 AM).\n\nKFMB debuted the \"Charlie & Harrigan\" morning show in 1972 hosted by Jack Woods (as Charlie) and Paul Menard (as Harrigan), who previously hosted that show on stations in Dallas and Cleveland. \"Charlie & Harrigan\" quickly became the most popular morning radio show in San Diego, before the hosts left for Dallas in 1975 and eventually returned to San Diego on rival station KCBQ in 1976. KFMB also began broadcasting Aztecs football and basketball games of San Diego State University in 1972.\n\nStarting in 1975, KFMB began adding talk shows to its lineup, with Mac Hudson and Joe Bauer co-hosting the \"Hudson & Bauer\" morning drive show, which provided humorous discussions of the news in the voices of various characters. Bobby Rich also joined KFMB around the same time. Mark Larson began the first of two stints with KFMB in June 1976 as a weekend DJ and moving up to weeknights from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. From roughly 1975 through 1989, KFMB was one of the top three highest rated stations in San Diego, frequently fighting its FM sister, then known as \"B-100\", for the top position.\n\nIn 1977, the KFMB stations moved to Kearny Mesa, where they would operate together for many decades to come.\n\nTed Leitner joined the KFMB TV and AM stations as a sports reporter in January 1978; in his first job at KFMB, he provided sports reports and commentary on \"Hudson & Bauer\". Bill Ballance, formerly of KABC in Los Angeles, began hosting \"All Talk Slice of the Night\" on KFMB on March 1, 1978. \n\nIn 1979, Larson became KFMB's program director, and KFMB became the flagship station for San Diego Padres baseball games, which were announced by Jerry Coleman and Leitner. KFMB dropped San Diego State sports in 1983.\n\nWith the KFMB stations under new management, KFMB dropped music and switched full time to a news/talk format in April 1994, debuting talk shows hosted by Geni Cavitt and Stacy Taylor and a two-hour news show during the 4 to 6 p.m. afternoon drive hours. With this format change, Larson left KFMB to become general manager of KPRZ. In June 1994, KFMB was among the first stations to carry the newly syndicated Laura Schlessinger radio show out of KFI in Los Angeles. Leitner, a longtime sports announcer and reporter for KFMB, debuted a general issues afternoon talk show in February 1995. In the same month, KFMB replaced evening host Rollye James with \"The Late Late Radio Show\", a syndicated show co-hosted by Tom Snyder and Elliott Forrest.\n\nKFMB began a second stint as the home of San Diego State football in 1996.\n\nAs a cost cutting measure, KFMB laid off its radio news staff in September 1997 and began sourcing news updates from KFMB television reporters; although the San Diego chapter of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) initially opposed the move before signing a new contract with KFMB stations in 1998. Then in October 1997, the \"Hudson and Bauer\" morning show ended its 22-year run on KFMB following the death of Mac Hudson at age 58. Former \"Charlie & Harrigan\" co-host Jack Woods returned to KFMB to replace Hudson in the successor \"Jack and Joe\" show. The end of the year saw the departure of another longtime host, as Stacy Taylor left KFMB after six years.\n\nBeginning in 1998, KFMB began broadcasting San Diego Chargers football games after XETRA's one-year contract expired. The following year, KFMB signed a contract extension to secure the rights to Chargers games until the 2004 season. That year, KFMB also replaced its afternoon news show with a sports talk show hosted by former Chargers running back Hank Bauer (no relation to Joe Bauer).\n\nThe year 2000 marked major changes to the KFMB lineup. Leitner moved from afternoon to morning drive in January, and his show became the lead-in to \"Jack and Joe\". Then in April, KFMB hired Rick Roberts away from KOGO as afternoon drive host. Regarding sports broadcasts, KFMB lost the rights to Padres baseball and San Diego State football games to KOGO, which was the Padres' original flagship station from 1969 to 1978; KFMB also dropped Hank Bauer's sports talk show at the end of 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Joe Bauer resigned from KFMB to join rival KPOP to host a show focusing on health and personal finance. Subsequently, Woods would reunite with \"Charlie & Harrigan\" co-host Menard for a show hosted under their real names.\n\nKFMB later expanded the presence of nationally syndicated conservative talk, dropping the Woods/Menard show and an evening sports talk show in March 2002 for \"The Sean Hannity Show\" and \"The Laura Ingraham Show\". Roberts attracted media attention for his frequent discussion of the murder of Danielle van Dam, an eight-year-old girl from San Diego, on his program.\n\nAfter Leitner stepped down from his longtime morning drive show for personal reasons, Roberts became the new morning drive host in February 2003.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, KFMB began broadcasting commentary by Paul Harvey. After many years affiliated with CBS Radio News, KFMB switched to ABC News Radio as its national news provider on April 23, 2006. Around 2008, KFMB returned to CBS Radio News.\n\nBy 2009, Roberts's KFMB show was among six local conservative talk radio shows in California measured by Arbitron to have a weekly audience of more than 100,000. As the Great Recession forced radio stations to make budget cuts, by 2010, Roberts was among only two local hosts of daily talk radio shows in San Diego. That changed in January 2011 as KFMB hired Mike Slater from WTJS in Jackson, Tennessee, as the new morning drive host. Roberts returned to his former afternoon drive slot that long had a syndicated show, \"The Savage Nation\".\n\nRoberts left KFMB in December 2011, and his show was replaced the following month by Roger Hedgecock, who moved his nationally syndicated show from KOGO. In October 2012, Hedgecock show producer Brett Winterble debuted his own evening show on KFMB in replacement of \"The Savage Nation\", which had temporarily exited syndication.\n\nHedgecock retired from his radio show on March 27, 2015; Slater became the new afternoon drive host March 30, and Hedgecock would remain a part-time commentator on KFMB. Winterble returned to KFMB as afternoon drive host in September 2015.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Midwest Television entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, which operated three Tijuana-licensed stations–XHRM-FM (92.5 FM), XETRA-FM (91.1 FM), and XHITZ-FM (90.3 FM) — forming an entity known as \"SDLocal\" to market all five stations together. Management said the intent of the agreement was to \"[preserve the] local ownership and operation of San Diego's top-rated radio stations\". The agreement ended at the end of 2016. Around the same time, KFMB dropped \"The Sean Hannity Show\" after 13 years in favor of an expansion of Slater's show and a one-hour news show leading into Winterble.\n\nIn October 2017, local media reported that KFMB-AM-FM-TV were being offered for sale by Midwest Television. On December 18, 2017, Tegna, Inc. announced it would purchase the KFMB stations for $325 million; the deal marked Tegna's re-entry into radio, as predecessor Gannett Company had sold its previous radio group to Evergreen Media in 1997. The sale was completed on February 15, 2018, ending the Meyer family's stewardship of the stations after 53 years.\n\nNielsen Audio ratings in the summer of 2019 ranked KFMB in 18th place among all San Diego area listeners, compared to sixth for KOGO.\n\nIn December 2019, Tegna agreed to sell KFMB-AM-FM to Local Media San Diego for $5 million, putting them back under common control with its three Mexican-licensed stations and separating them from KFMB-TV. The deal does not include the rights to the KFMB call letters; thus, the call signs of the KFMB radio stations will change after the closure of the acquisition. Local Media had reportedly explored reselling the AM station after the closure, and promptly announced a $1.2 million resale of KFMB to iHeartMedia when the deal closed on March 17, 2020; KFMB immediately flipped to a temporary full-time simulcast of KOGO at noon local time, with its regular programming resuming on March 19. KFMB host Mark Larson said that the KOGO simulcast was necessary due to \"the huge logistic challenges\" associated with the ownership change.\n\nWinterble left KFMB to join WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, in February 2020.\n\nThe KFMB studios are located in San Diego's Kearny Mesa district, while the station transmitter resides in nearby Santee; the transmitter location is unique in that it resides on both sides of a highway, in this case, California State Route 52. \n\nKFMB is one of a few medium wave radio stations in the United States that significantly increases power at night—with a daytime power of 5,000 watts and a nighttime power of 50,000 watts. This is because of the close proximity of KBRT on 740 AM. The nighttime signal is boosted, while KBRT is lowered to 190 watts. The signal is non-directional during the day, but at night, it operates on a two-tower directional antenna system, pointing away from the east, to protect WJR also on 760 AM. KFMB is a Class B station. \n\nWeekdays consist of conservative talk radio shows, with two locally produced shows during the daytime hosted by Mark Larson and Mike Slater and nationally syndicated shows in other times, including \"Armstrong & Getty\", \"The Mark Levin Show\", and \"Red Eye Radio\". CBS News Radio provides news updates at the top of each hour.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806227", "title": "List of Bugatti prototypes", "text": "List of Bugatti prototypes\n\nThis is a list of prototype vehicles created by Bugatti that never reached full production.\n\nThe Type 36 racer, produced in 1925, introduced a new 1.5 L (1493 cc/91 in³) straight-8 engine. With a 60 by 66 mm bore and stroke, the engine later found a place in the Type 39A, though the Type 36 project was more of an experiment. At first, the rear axle was bolted directly to the frame with no springs. In 1926, Bugatti added both springs and a supercharger to the Type 36. This was the experimental base for the Type 35C.\n\nThe 16-cylinder Type 45 racing car and similar Type 47 \"Grand Sport\" were to become a new generation of cars from Bugatti. The engine, a 3-valve SOHC design, was based on the 3-valve straight-8 from the Type 35. Two versions were made: A 3.0 L (2986 cc/182 in³) version fitted to a Type 47 prototype shared the Type 36's 60 by 66 mm dimensions, while the Type 45 prototype used a unique 84 mm stroke for 3.8 L (3801 cc/231 in³). Output would have been 200 to 250 hp (149 to 186 kW) with a Roots-type supercharger in play.\n\nThe entire vehicle was unique, including its chassis. The Type 45 used a 102.2 in (2596 mm) wheelbase, while the Type 47 was stretched to 108.3 in (2750 mm). Both had a 49.2 in (1250 mm) track.\n\nThe Type 56 was an electric vehicle. The number built is controversial; six seems the most likely answer.\n\nThe Bugatti 56 was originally designed for private use by Ettore Bugatti as a factory runabout, but due to popular demand from previous customers convinced him to build some extra types 56.\n\nThe Type 56 was a tiny 2-seat open car very much in the style of turn-of-the-century horseless carriages or voiturettes. Power came from a single 28 amp electric motor producing 1 hp (0.8 kW). Energy was stored in six 6 volt accumulators in series for a total of 36 volts. The motor was mounted directly to the frame and drove the rear wheels through gears. Electric braking was allowed, and both hand- and foot-brakes operated on rear wheel drums. Four forward speeds were available, and the vehicle could accelerate to 28 km/h (17.4 mph). Steering was by tiller.\n\nEttore Bugatti's personal 56 is part of the collection at the Musée National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse.\n\nThe Bugatti Type 64 was an Atlantic-style coupe produced in 1939 with papillon [French for \"butterfly\"] doors, designed by Jean Bugatti. It was fitted with a 4.4 L (4432 cc/270 in³) 2-valve DOHC straight-8 engine and rode on a 130 in (3300 mm) wheelbase. Three cars were started, but only one body was finished before Jean Bugatti's death in 1939; a second was completed in 2012.\n\nBegun in 1943 and completed in 1947 after the war, the Type 73C was to be a comeback for Bugatti. But the death of Ettore Bugatti in August of that year doomed the project. An engine-less Type 73 was shown at the 1947 Paris Motor Show two months later. Although five 73C chassis had been constructed in Paris, Only one body was completed for these cars and at least three engines and one complete car were assembled and tested by the factory. Serge Pozzoli stated that he visited the Bugatti factory at Rue Debarcadere in Paris where he saw a demonstration car which was fitted with a scaled down body similar to the pre-war Type 50BIII (Cork Car). All the cars were dismantled and taken to Molsheim after Ettore Bugatti's death.\n\nThe Type 73C used a new 1.5 L (1488 cc/90 in³) straight-4 engine with 4 valves per cylinder and a twin overhead camshaft. This was a new design with a 76 mm bore and 95 mm stroke, wet cylinder liners, a detachable cylinder head, and a single cast iron exhaust manifold. Much to the chagrin of Bugatti purists, the Type 73 used off-the-shelf hex fasteners rather than the custom-designed parts used in all previous cars.\n\nThe five Type 73C chassis were sold off after the company exited automobile production. Most were later assembled, and one (number 2) was even given a body based on the original Bugatti drawings.\n\nThere are several prototype Type 73 Bugatti models.\n\nType 73: Touring two- or four-seater; four-cylinder, twin overhead camshaft, four valves per cylinder\n\nType 73A: Touring two- or four-seater four-cylinder Single overhead camshaft with three valves per cylinder.\n\nType 73C: Grand Prix single seater: The engine fitted to this car is similar to the Type 73\n\nType 73B: touring two- or four-seater: Similar engine to the Type 73 but with single overhead camshaft.\n\nThe final resurgence of the original Bugatti was the Type 251, completed in 1955. Designed by Gioacchino Colombo of Ferrari fame, it was powered by a new 2.5 L (2486 cc/151 in³) straight-8. Uniquely, this engine was mounted transversely, behind the driver. For the first time in a Bugatti, an oversquare engine was used with a 76 mm bore and 68.5 mm stroke. A de Dion tube rear suspension was also a novelty for the company, though it was in vogue at the time. The Type 251 was entered in the 1956 French Grand Prix, driven by Maurice Trintignant, but was not competitive and retired after 18 laps.\n"}

The site is also occupied by the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nIn April 2011, Exelon of Chicago announced its intention to purchase Constellation Energy, the owner and operator of Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station. The acquisition was approved by FERC and the companies officially combined on March 12, 2012 with Constellation Energy taking the Exelon name. Exelon shares ownership of Unit 1 with Électricité de France (49.99%) and Unit 2 with Électricité de France (40.99%), and Long Island Power Authority (18%). Exelon is the sole operator of both Units 1 & 2. Both units are boiling water reactors (BWRs).\n\nBoth units are General Electric boiling water reactors (BWR). Unit 1, a BWR-2 (Generation 2), went online in 1969 and has a rated capacity of . It is the oldest operating commercial nuclear reactor still in service in the United States. Unit 2, a BWR-5, has been in operation since 1988 and has a rated capacity of 1,375 MW. Construction of both units, along with neighboring Fitzpatrick, was commissioned by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. Fitzpatrick was sold immediately upon completion, while Niagara Mohawk retained its share of the Nine Mile Point units until 2001, when it sold them to Constellation.\n\nOn October 31, 2006, Constellation announced that the NRC had granted 20-year license extensions to both units. Unit 1 is now licensed to operate until 2029 and Unit 2 is licensed until 2046.\n\nThe Nine Mile Point 2 cooling tower is 543 feet tall and is visible from Chimney Bluffs in Sodus, New York nearly 30 miles away. Nine Mile Point 1 draws cooling water from Lake Ontario, and does not have a cooling tower.\n\nIn early May 2011, the plant operator reported that the plant fuel supplier, General Electric, notified the operator that mathematical errors could've resulted in the reactor's fuel getting hotter than expected.\n\nIn 2016, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo directed the Public Service Commission to consider ratepayer-financed subsidies similar to those for renewable sources to keep nuclear power stations profitable in the competition against natural gas. Indian Point would not be included in the scheme.\n\nUnistar Nuclear, a joint venture between Constellation Energy and Électricité de France (EDF), announced in late 2008 that it had notified the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of its plan to submit a combined construction and operating license (COL) application for a European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) at Constellation Energy's Nine Mile Point site. Less than a year later however, Unistar requested a temporary suspension of the application review, and in 2013, citing a lack of federal loan guarantees, withdrew the application completely.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Nine Mile Point was 35,632, an increase of 17.0 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 909,523, an increase of 3.2 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Syracuse (36 miles to city center).\n\nOn August 13, 1991 a \"site area emergency\" was declared at the plant. According to \"Time\" magazine, this was the third occasion an SAE had been declared at a US nuclear plant.\n\nThe emergency was due to an electrical fault which caused a momentary loss of electrical power to the reactor and control room. The operators shut down the reactor in accordance with the emergency plan requirements. There were no injuries or release of radiation as a result of the incident. The reactor left emergency procedures about 13 hours after initiation.\n\nFrom NRC Information Notice 91-64, Supplement 1:\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Nine Mile Point was Reactor 1: 1 in 238,095; Reactor 2: 1 in 178,571, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\n"}

Frio left the series after the 1990-91 season and was succeeded by Barry Nolan in the fall of 1991. Nolan and Murphy would stay until after the 1997-98 season, when they both departed. In the show's final season, Kyle Kraska took over as the sole host.\n\n\"Hard Copy\" was produced and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television and, for much of its time on air, was often aired with its sister show, the Hollywood news program \"Entertainment Tonight\" as part of an hour-long programming block sold to local stations.\n\n\"Hard Copy\" was a tabloid show that aired footage and news about celebrities and everyday people. Also featured were interviews with various newsmakers.\n\nIn 1992, Elton John threatened to take \"Hard Copy\" to court, alleging a reporter tried to blackmail him into giving an interview by falsely claiming he had AIDS and had moved to Atlanta to be near an AIDS treatment center. John alleged extortion, slander, invasion of privacy and reckless endangerment.\n\nThe day after the lawsuit was filed, the show ran a segment about John but, rather than accuse him of having HIV, praised him for the work he was doing for those affected by the disease. John's attorney told \"The Enquirer\" he \"assume(d) the show was changed as a result of our suit\".\n\nOn November 27, 1994, FOX aired an episode of \"The Simpsons\" entitled \"Homer Badman\". When Homer takes babysitter Ashley Grant home from babysitting their kids, he is assumed to commit sexual harassment though in reality he is trying to eat a rare piece of gummi candy. The entire incident devolves into a media frenzy complete with a stand off. To make matters worse, Dennis Franz voiced himself playing Homer in a TV movie.\n\nAs a result, Homer takes part in a \"Hard Copy\"-like show called \"Rock Bottom\". However, the show distorts Homer's case and it takes public access cable and aid from Groundskeeper Willie, who was filming in the area at the time of the incident, to clear Homer's name. The episode ended with \"Rock Bottom\" giving a series of corrections.\n\nIn 1996, actor George Clooney began a public boycott of both \"Hard Copy\" and Paramount's celebrity news show \"Entertainment Tonight\" after \"Hard Copy\" violated a six-month agreement not to air segments about Clooney by airing footage of Clooney and then-girlfriend Celine Balitran on the set of his film \"Batman & Robin\". Other celebrities supported the boycott including Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna, and Steven Spielberg. Paramount eventually agreed to modify the way that both shows gathered information for their stories. They also agreed not to air \"unauthorized footage\" of celebrities or \"footage that is known to have been obtained illegally.\"\n\n\nAn Australian version of the series hosted by Gordon Elliott aired in the early 1990s.\n\n"}

The facility includes 3x radiation treatment machines, 2x clinics and 33x chemotherapy spaces. The first patients were treated in April 2010.\n\nIn 2012, a ten-year Phase 3 expansion project was completed to provide the following improvements: 10 new Operating Room suites, a new and expanded Ambulatory Care Centre, a new Rehabilitation Centre, a new Physiotherapy Centre and a 15-station Hemodialysis unit. The 140,000 sq ft expansion also included renovations to the pharmacy and laboratory departments and significantly expanded the diagnostic imaging department, doubling the number of MRI and CT scanners and additional nuclear medicine and biopsy units.\n\nIn 2014, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Minister of Energy Bob Chiarelli announced the approval of a new 34-bed Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) Unit at QCH.

The rent was $23,000 per year, in the contract until 2013, when the rent was expected to increase to reflect the current market value of the land parcel.\n\nPierre Poilievre, Federal MP representing the riding of Nepean—Carleton, attempted to reduce the rent of the hospital to $1 per year during his first term in office. Poilievre introduced a bill in November 2005 seeking to reduce the hospital's rent, which saw support from the Conservative Party of Canada and New Democratic Party.\n\nPoilievre was re-elected in the 2006 Federal election and was named Parliamentary secretary to John Baird, President of the Treasury Board. Together, the two men unveiled a plan in August 2006 which would use Treasury Board funds to pay the NCC rent on behalf of the hospital, such that the hospital continued to pay only $1 in rent.\n"}

Carey's self-titled debut album in 1990 yielded four number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the first being \"Vision of Love\", a song credited with revolutionizing the usage of distinguished vocal stylings, predominantly the practice of melisma, and effectively influencing virtually every female R&B performer since the 1990s. Subsequent singles \"Emotions\" (1991) and Carey's cover of the Jackson 5 track, \"I'll Be There\" (1992) continued the singer's streak of US number-one singles, with the latter becoming her fourth chart-topper in Canada and first in the Netherlands. With the release of Carey's third studio album, \"Music Box\" (1993), the singer's international popularity surged upon release of \"Hero\" and the album's third single, her cover of Harry Nilsson's \"Without You\", which became the singer's first number-one single in several countries across Europe.\n\nCarey's holiday album \"Merry Christmas\" (1994) produced the singer's perennial yule-tide classic \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". With its continual expanding legacy, the song remains her highest seller and one of the best-selling singles of all time, with global sales of over 16 million copies. As of 2013, the song is estimated to have generated over $50 million in royalties. And on December 21, 2019, a full quarter-century after its original release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" topped the Hot 100 for the very first time.\n\nIn 1995, the singer released her fifth studio effort, \"Daydream\". Its singles \"Fantasy\" and \"One Sweet Day\" (with Boyz II Men) became Carey's ninth and tenth US number one singles, with the latter spending a record sixteen weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In following years, she released \"Butterfly\"s (1997) \"Honey\" – which became Carey's third single to debut atop the US chart, a record she still maintains with Drake – and \"When You Believe\" (with Whitney Houston). The singer's version of \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" (1999) (with Westlife) became her second chart-topping single in the UK.\n\nFollowing a tumultuous period in the singer's personal life, her ensuing albums/soundtrack \"Glitter\" (2001) and \"Charmbracelet\" (2002) failed to gain significant commercial traction, and led to a series of unsuccessful singles. Largely considered her come-back album, Carey's tenth studio effort \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" (2005) revived faith in the singer's stock, with single \"We Belong Together\" becoming her strongest international showing in years, and topping the chart in the US for 14-weeks and breaking several radio airplay records. In 2010, \"We Belong Together\" was listed by \"Billboard\" as the most successful song of the decade. In 2008, \"Touch My Body\", the lead single from her album \"E=MC²\", became Carey's 18th chart-topper on the Hot 100, making her the solo artist with the most number ones in the charts history. Since \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\" (2009), Carey has released a string of moderate to unsuccessful singles following into the release of her most recent offering, \"Caution\" (2018). In 2019, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" became Carey's 19th number-one song on the Hot 100, extending her record for the solo artist with the most number ones in the charts history.

Although at first warmly welcomed when he reached Ethiopia, the Caliph's candidate began to openly favor Islam in that Christian country by building seven mosques, ostensibly for the use of Muslim traders. This led to a general uproar in Ethiopia. Abuna Sawiros justified his acts by saying a refusal to build these mosques would result in a persecution in Egypt; nevertheless, the Abuna was imprisoned, the seven mosques destroyed, and restrictions placed on the Muslim traders. Reciprocal acts followed in Egypt, and a rupture in the relations between the two countries.\n\nThere had been a leadership dispute upon the selection of St. Cyril II as patriarch. According to the Coptic Church, a council of forty-seven bishops was assembled to depose him, and supported by a Muslim overseer of an orchard called Yaseeb.

Unit 1's extended operating license is set to expire on June 25, 2037 and Unit 2's on March 31, 2041.\n\nThis plant has two Westinghouse reactors.\nBoth units are three-loop pressurized water reactors. The facility is cooled using six mechanical draft cooling towers supplied by water from the Chattahoochee River.\n\n\nThe NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Farley was 11,842, an increase of 8.0 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 421,374, an increase of 6.1 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Dothan (17 miles to city center).\n\nThe NRC's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Farley was 1 in 35,714, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n"}

Before his ordination, the Episcopal Seat was vacant for 19 years, in part due to the competition between the three candidates vying for the position including ibn Laqlaq himself. His ordination was controversial.\n\nThe See of St Mark remained vacant for seven years, six months and 28 days after the death of Cyril ibn Laqlaq until he was succeeded by Pope Athanasius III of Alexandria on Sunday 9 October 1250 AD. After the departure of Cyrilibn Laqlaq, the Apostolic Throne remained vacant because of the intense persecution which did not allow the Copts to elect a successor. Cyril ibn Laqlaq was buried in the Wax Monastery in Giza (دير الشمع في الجيزة).\n\nIn his time, the Papal Residence was located at the Church of The Holy Virgin Mary & St Damiana known as The Hanging Church (الكنيسة المعلقة) in Coptic Cairo.\n\nRegretfully, the history of the Coptic Church remembers him as a lover of money who did not ordain a bishop nor a priest nor a deacon without getting paid (a practice which is called Simony - the act of selling church offices and roles, named after the story of Simon Magus narrated in Acts 8:9-24).\n\nIn 1238, he issued a new set of canons for the Coptic church and its dependencies in Ethiopia, Nubia, and Cyrenaica.\n\nThe episcopate of Cyril III ibn Laqlaq started on 17 June 1235 AD and ended on 10 March 1243 AD, but the Episcopal Seat had been vacant for 19 years before his consecration (i.e. since 1216 AD), in part due to the competition between the three candidates vying for the position including ibn Laqlaq. Additionally, the Episcopal Seat remained vacant after the death of ibn Laqlaq for almost seven years and seven months until the consecration of his successor Pope Athanasius III of Alexandria on 9 October 1250 AD. The 34 years that had passed from the death of his predecessor, Pope John VI of Alexandria, the 74th Pope of Alexandria, in 1216 AD to his own death in 1243, and to the later consecration of his successor Pope Athanasius III of Alexandria in 1250 AD saw the reign of Egypt come under the following rules:\n\n1200 – August 1218 AD: The fourth Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt and Syria Al-Adil I - (الملك العادل, al-Malik al-Adil Sayf ad-Din Abu-Bakr Ahmed ibn Najm ad-Din Ayyub, الملك العادل سيف الدين أبو بكر بن أيوب; born 1145– died 1218 AD). From his honorific title Sayf ad-Din (\"Sword of Faith\"), he was known to the Frankish Crusaders as Saphadin. He was a gifted and effective administrator and a capable general and strategist who provided crucial military and civilian support for the great campaigns of his brother Saladin. The foundation and persistence of the Ayyubid Sultanate was as much his achievement as Saladin's.\n\n1218 – 6 March 1238 AD: The fifth Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt and Syria Al-Kamil - (الملك الكامل). During his tenure as Sultan, the Ayyubids defeated the Fifth Crusade (1213–1221 AD). He was known to the Frankish Crusaders as Meledin. He was defeated in the Sixth Crusade however, and as a result, he ceded Jerusalem. He his famous in Western history for his cordial meeting in 1219 AD with Saint Francis, as apparently he thought that Saint Francis was an embassy of the Crusaders to reach a settlement.\n\n6 March 1238 – 1240 AD: The sixth Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt and Syria Al-Adil II - (الملك العادل أبو بكر بن الكامل) (Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Sayf ad-Dīn Abū Bakr ibn Nāṣir ad-Dīn Muḥammad - سيف الدين الملك العادل أبو بكر بن ناصر الدين محمد) (born c. 1221 – died 9 February 1248). When his father al-Kamil, nephew of Saladin, died in 1238, al-Adil II followed him somewhat unprepared. When the country plunged into anarchy, his exiled half-brother, as-Salih Ayyub, seized the opportunity and deposed him. Al-Adil died in prison eight years later (In 1248 AD).\n\n1240 – 22 November 1249 AD: The seventh Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt and Syria As-Salih Ayyub - Al-Malik as-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub (الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب). He was born in Cairo on 5 November 1205 and died 22 November 1249 in Al Mansurah during the siege of Al Mansurah during the Seventh Crusade (1249–1250) led by Louis IX of France. As-Salih Ayyub is nicknamed Abu al-Futuh (أبو الفتوح).\n\n2 May 1250–July 1250 AD: Shajar al-Durr (شجر الدر, \"Tree of Pearls\") whose Royal Name was al-Malika `Aṣmat ad-Dīn Umm-Khalīl Shajar ad-Durr (الملكة عصمة الدين أم خليل شجر الدر) (nicknamed: أم خليل, Umm Khalil; mother of Khalil) (died 28 April 1257 in Cairo). She was the wife of Sultan al-Malik As-Salih Ayyub (الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب), Egypt's seventh Ayyubid Sultan and later married Izz al-Din Aybak, Egypt's Sultan of the Bahri Mamluk dynasty. Aybak married her to claim access to the throne. Shajar al-Durr played a crucial role after the death of her first husband in Al-Mansura (22 November 1249) during the Seventh Crusade (1249–1250). She became the Sultana of Egypt on May 2, 1250 (648 AH), marking the end of the Ayyubid reign and the start of the Mamluk era. Her reign was short, lasting under three months. Many Muslim historians believed that she was of Turkic origin and some believed that she was of Armenian origin\n\nJuly 1250 AD (five days, first Reign): Mamluk Sultan al-Muizz Izz al-Din Aybak (1250-1257 AD, 648-655 AH, Assassinated) (الملك المعز عز الدين أيبك التركماني الجاشنكير) - His official reign was from 1254-1257 AD, however, he was the de facto ruler since 1250 AD.\n\nJuly 1250 – 1254 AD: Ayyubid Sultan (al-Malik) al-Ashraf II Muzaffar ad-Din [Musa Al-Asharf موسى الأشرف, (reign 1250-1254 AD / 648-650 AH)]. Al-Ashraf Musa (الأشرف موسى) was the last, albeit titular, Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt. Al-Ashraf Musa, Sultan of Egypt, was the puppet of the strong Mamluk ruler Izz ad-Din Aybak.\n\nThe Episcopate of Pope Cyril III of Alexandria (1235-1243) fell during the reigns of Al-Kamil(الملك الكامل)(1218-1238 AD), Al-Adil II (الملك العادل الثاني)(1238-1240), and his brother As-Salih Ayyub (الملك الصالح) (1240-1249).\n\nHis predecessor, Pope John VI of Alexandria, the 74th Pope of Alexandria, died in 1216 in grief over the conversion of the entire population of Pentapolis in Eastern Libya from Christianity to Islam, even though he had ordained a bishop for Pentapolis (the five western cities) after a long period where there was no bishop for this area (in hopes of strengthing the church there). John VI came from a rich family before his ordination, but he lived a simple life and used his family wealth to pay for his expenses and for the expenses of the Patriarchate and those of his aids. He did not want to burden the church or its people with his expenses, but he lived all his days supporting himself and his companions, and he gave charity to the poor of his own money and refused to answer the demands of the Church leaders in Alexandria for payments out of the church coffers (as was the custom before him). Thus, in his time, sufficient money accumulated in the Church coffers. This attracted the attention of a powerful monk and a priest named David (Dawoud) of Fayyum ibn Laqlaq (داود بن لقلق - داود الفيومي) who desired to seize this money. John VI was patriarch for 27 years [1189-1216 AD]. This simple pope had predicted before his departure that \"pain would befall the church and its people and the Lord would establish a man who would come from where they did not know\". John VI died unhappy about the state of affairs of the Church and wary of the plans of Dawoud ibn Laqlaq.\n\nThe ordination of Cyril ibn Laqlaq was controversial. On the very day that John VI died, supporters of the priest and monk David of Fayyum (داود الفيومي) started lobbying for his consecration as patriarch, on his behest. However, there was severe opposition to his consecration. The selection of David of Fayyum was supported by many powerful individuals including the Ayyubite Sultan Al-Adil (reigned 1200-1218 AD, الملك العادل) There was a deadlock in reaching a decision but the supporters of David of Fayyum (داود الفيومي) were powerful enough to block the selection of any other candidate. Thus, the Episcopal seat remained vacant for 19 years. This is the longest vacancy of the Seat of the Bishop of Alexandria in the history of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Finally, David of Fayyum (داود الفيومي) was selected as Patriarch against the opposition of many.\n\nDue to his influence before he became the Pope it was not possible to ordain any other person except him, which led to about nineteen years of vacancy of that important post. This is the longest vacancy in the history of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nCyril used the increasing military and political power of Egypt over Jerusalem to appoint a Coptic Orthodox bishop of that church, which until then had been the prerogative of the Patriarch of Antioch. This angered Patriarch Ignatius III David, who retaliated by attempting unsuccessfully to fill the vacancy of \"Abuna\" or metropolitan for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. This was a very rare incident between the two churches, as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two churches.\n\nAlthough he started his papacy by abiding to the Coptic Church's laws forbidding simony, he soon started selling ranks in the church. The Coptic Church's Bishops gathered in a synod in an attempt to prevent this. They decided to hold a general council of the clergy and the archons to look into the situation and make recommendations. Sultan al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb (1239–1249) took the initiative and summoned that council. It is thought that Cyril II bribed the caliphal court with 12,000 dinars and due to this he was able to swing the verdict, continuing the practice of simony\n\nDespite opposition to Cyril he was able to rule the church in relative peace until his death in 1243. His reign lasted seven years, nine months, and ten days, and he was buried in Wax Monastery (Dair El-Shamaa) at Giza, Egypt. After his death his Throne of Saint Mark remained vacant for seven years.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar, St Francis of Assisi went to Egypt during the Fifth Crusade (1213–1221 AD) hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt, Al-Kamil (reign 1218–†1238 AD), believing that if this should happen, it would be sufficient to put an end to the conflict of the Crusades, or win martyrdom in his attempt. Earlier, St Francis tried to go to Morocco once, but he became ill by the time he reached Spain on his way to Morocco. The other friars who accompanied him and continued on to Morocco to preach to the Muslims became martyrs there.\n\nIn the summer of 1219, a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of Damietta. At the start of the siege, the Sultan, al-Kamil, a nephew of Saladin (reign 1174–†1193), who had just succeeded his father Sultan Al-Adil I (reign 1200–†1218) as Sultan of Egypt, was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Crusaders on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks. It was most probably during this interlude that St Francis and his companion Brother Pacifico crossed the enemy lines and were brought before the Sultan, remaining in his camp for a few days. The visit is reported in contemporary Crusader sources and in the earliest biographies of St Francis, but they give no information about what transpired during the encounter beyond noting that the Sultan received Francis graciously and that Francis preached to the Muslims without effect, returning unharmed to the Crusader camp. The Sultan, al-Kamil received him kindly. No contemporary Arab source mentions the visit. One detail, added by St Francis’ companion and biographer, friar Bonaventure (1221–†1274) in the official life of Francis (written in 1259, forty years after the event), is that St Francis offered to challenge the Sultan's \"priests\" (i.e. Islamic “Ulema” or “Sheikhs”) to trial-by-fire in order to prove the veracity of the Christian Gospel. Although Bonaventure asserts that the sultan refused to permit the challenge, subsequent biographies went further, claiming that a fire was actually kindled which Francis unhesitatingly entered without suffering burns.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for Acre, where they spent 9–11 months. From Acre, they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. The Franciscan Order has been present in the Holy Land almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions in 1333 from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt Al-Malik Al-Nasir Nasir ad-Din Muhammad (reign 1310–1341) with regard to certain Holy Places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\n\n[1] \"History of the Patriarchs\", Manuscript No 91, at the Library of the Coptic Patriarchate.\n\n[2] \"History of the Patriarch\" by Abba Youssaab Bishop of Fouh (13th Century), based on a manuscript at the Monastery of the Virgin Mary known as the Syrian Monastery, and a copy thereof in the Library of Girguis Philotheos Awad, a prominent Coptic Scholar of the 20th Century.\n\n[3] \"The Letters of Cyril ibn Laqlaq\", Manuscript No 291 Theology, at the Library of the Coptic Patriarchate.\n\n[4] \"Kitab Al-Tawareekh\" by \"Abi-Shaker ibn Al-Raheb\", Manuscript Copy in the Library of Girguis Philotheos Awad, a prominent Coptic Scholar of the 20th Century.\n\n[5] \"History of Myron (Chrismation Oil)\", Manuscript No 101 Rites, at the Library of the Coptic Patriarchate.\n\n[6] \"History of the Patriarchs\", Manuscript No 15 History, at the Library of the Coptic Patriarchate.\n\n[7] \"Canons of the Fathers\", Manuscript No 5 History, at the Library of the Coptic Patriarchate.\n\n[8] \"Canons of the Fathers\", Manuscript dated to 1072 A.

Four examples were made, each with a 2.0 L (1991 cc/121 in³) straight-8 engine based on that in the Type 30. \"The Tank\" finished third in the ACF Grand Prix that year. This was the first Bugatti to be fitted with roller-bearing big ends in order to improve the bottom-end reliability (Bugatti was rather later than most manufacturers in the incorporation of a fully pressurised oil system, preferring a splash \"spit and hope\" delivery method). The Type 32 also broke new ground (for a racing Bug) by using a three-speed and reverse transaxle unit, the exceptionally short wheelbase and long straight-8 engine making a conventional gearbox difficult to accommodate. It also heralded an hydraulic front brake actuation. \nAnother tank-bodied Bugatti racer, the 1936 Type 57G, was much more successful.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806293", "title": "Hurricane Bertha (1996)", "text": "Hurricane Bertha (1996)\n\nHurricane Bertha was an intense and early-forming major hurricane that affected areas from the Leeward Islands to the United States in July of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane during the season. Bertha originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa in early July. Steadily organizing while moving generally towards the west, the disturbance was designated as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 5, and was further upgraded to a tropical storm by 1200 UTC later that day. Over the next few days, continued intensification occurred, and Bertha became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, the first hurricane of the season, prior to moving through the northern Leeward Islands. Late on July 8, a period of rapid intensification began, and at 0600 UTC on July 9, Bertha reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of with a minimum barometric pressure of . Moving around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, Bertha passed north of the Bahamas as a weakening hurricane before turning towards the north-northeast and undergoing another period of rapid intensification. Late on July 12, Bertha made landfall between Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach, North Carolina with winds of . Gradual weakening ensued the following day as Bertha moved up the Mid-Atlantic and into New England before becoming an extratropical cyclone on July 14.\n\nAs Bertha passed through the northern Leeward Islands, it caused moderate to severe damage. In the United States Virgin Islands, heavy rainfall, hurricane-force winds, and significant property damage was reported. In addition, many boats were destroyed, and total damage was estimated near $7.5 million (1996 USD). In Puerto Rico, effects from Bertha were very similar to those in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Heavy rainfall was recorded, peaking over half a foot in isolated areas. Despite this, reports of widespread inland flooding were scarce. Tropical storm-force winds were observed, which is the cause of two indirect fatalities, when they were killed in a traffic accident. One death was directly attributed to Bertha when a tourist drowned in rough seas in Luquillo, Puerto Rico. Damage in Puerto Rico was also estimated to be near $7.5 million. The most devastating effects from the hurricane occurred in the United States, more specifically the state of North Carolina. Several fishing piers, marinas, and boats were destroyed as a result of Bertha's storm surge, and buildings across the eastern portion of the state were significantly damaged. Moderate rainfall spread across much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as Bertha moved towards the north, along with winds in excess of tropical storm force. In total, twelve fatalities were caused by Hurricane Bertha, primarily in Florida from rough seas.\n\nOn July 1, a tropical wave emerged off of the coast of Africa. On July 3, a weak low-level circulation developed while located south of Cape Verde. The disturbance moved westward, and on July 5, it strengthened into a tropical depression in the central Atlantic. The depression tracked westward across the open waters of the Atlantic along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. Later that day, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and was named \"Bertha\". Over the next three days, Bertha tracked west-northwest while gradual intensification was occurring. On July 7, Bertha was upgraded to a hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) while east of Guadeloupe.\n\nThe next day, the center of circulation passed over Antigua as Bertha traversed the extreme northeastern portion of the Caribbean Sea causing moderate to minor damages. After that, Bertha passed rapidly in the southern portion of Sint Maarten. The storm gradually turned to the northwest on July 9 as maximum sustained winds reached 115 mph (185 km/h) while located northwest of Puerto Rico. Because the highest winds were located on the northeastern portion of the circulation, Puerto Rico received only tropical storm force winds near 50 mph. Forward speed slowed to 15 mph (25 km/h) as Bertha passed within 60 miles (100 km) of the Turks and Caicos, just before reaching its peak intensity.\n\nContinuing its gradual turn, the track soon became north-northwest as the forward speed slowed further to 10 mph (16 km/h) on July 10 and July 11. On July 12, Bertha made landfall between Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach. Bertha lost hurricane intensity just after landfall. It then accelerated to the northeast along the East Coast of the United States, producing winds of up to 60 mph (100 km/h). It moved north, and lost all of its tropical characteristics by July 18.\nIn the United States Virgin Islands, rainfall from Bertha peaked at 3.28 in (83.3 mm) on Saint Thomas. Winds from the storm were reported to be sustained at 85 mph (140 km/h) with an unofficial observation of 100 mph (155 km/h). Two boats were destroyed, five were grounded, and nine others washed ashore. One injury occurred in Coral Bay as a man rode out the storm in his sailboat. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported that 1,415 homes were damaged, 43 of which lost their roofs. Governor Roy Schneider noted that there were at least 20 boats that blew ashore in Charlotte Amalie. Damages from the storm were estimated at $7.5 million.\n\nThe maximum rainfall reported in association with Bertha was along the Rio Icacos in Naguabo. Wind reports from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base on July 8 indicated a maximum sustained wind speed of . Although heavy rain did occur, there was no widespread or significant inland flooding reported. There were, however, several reports of swollen rivers which caused some minor flooding of low lying and urban areas; coastal flooding was reported from Carolina to Loiza along road 187. In addition, recorded rainfall at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport was .\n\nOne death is attributed to Hurricane Bertha; a tourist drowned while surfing in high seas at the Playa Azul beach area in Luquillo. Two other deaths occurred indirectly as a result of Bertha, when two people were killed in a traffic accident while tropical storm force winds were occurring. The hardest hit area was the municipality of Culebra, where most of the damage was to agriculture and commerce. However, because damages were minimum, none of the municipalities were declared disaster areas. The Housing Department estimated damages to homes at $410,000. The agricultural damages were estimated at $6 million in the San Juan, Caguas, and Ponce Regions, mostly wind damage to coffee, plantain, and banana crops. In all, it is estimated that $7.5 million in damage in Puerto Rico were attributed to Bertha.\n\nOn Antigua, the storm brought sustain winds of and gusts up to . Damage throughout the country of Antigua and Barbuda was regarded as generally minor, limited to mainly 10 homes. Electricity was restored by July 9. The Bahamas and the north coast of the Dominican Republic likely suffered light damage, though no damage figures are available for either.\n\nIn Florida, a man was caught in rip currents offshore Jacksonville Beach and drowned. Further south, swells also lashed the coasts of Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach Counties. Throughout the area, beach patrols and lifeguards made dozens of rescues. Two other people drowned from rip currents in separate incidents at an unguarded section of Miami Beach. Additional fatality occurred in the state after a military jet evacuating the storm crashed into a house.\n\nMinimal impact was reported in Georgia, mainly limited to about $2 million in lost revenue for local businesses along the east coast of the state. In South Carolina, gale-force winds affected the coast, while tides caused minor beach erosion. Wind gusts up to in Cherry Grove left some damage in Horry County, totalling $784,000.\n\nWhen Bertha made landfall between Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach, North Carolina, it brought a storm surge of 8–10 feet (2.4–3 m) to the coast of the state. Several fishing piers and marinas were destroyed along with numerous boats. A few locations reported sustained hurricane-force winds, including at Frying Pan Shoals, at the New River, in Topsail Beach, and in North Topsail Beach. Several locations recorded hurricane-force wind gust, with the highest being at Frying Pan Shoals. Tropical storm force winds were observed throughout much of eastern North Carolina.\n\nIn Onslow County, 199 structures were destroyed, of which 117 were mobile homes. In New Hanover County, 1,750 buildings sustained damage. In Kure Beach, near where Bertha made landfall, 3 homes had their roofs blown off and all structures in the area were damaged. Losses in New Hanover reached about $19 million. In Pender County, 40 homes were undermined by beach erosion and four were destroyed. Damages in the county were estimated at $14.5 million. Agricultural losses in Wayne, Wilson, and Johnston Counties were estimated at $21 million.\n\nAs Bertha passed through southeastern Virginia and the lower Delmarva Peninsula, strong feeder bands produced strong wind gusts in the area. In King George County, a roof was blown onto a tree, while a garage collapsed and a metal shed was demolished. Near the community of Butzner Corner in Stafford County, siding was ripped from a few homes, one of which also suffered damage to the skylight. Wind gusts up to in Stafford County felled trees in the Fredericksburg area. Falling tree limbs in Portsmouth caused temporary power outages. Over of rain fell across southeastern Virginia.\n\nTides in Washington, D.C. increased to above normal, causing minor flooding at Hains Point and the Waterfront.\n\nIn Maryland, Bertha spawned three tornadoes along the western shore of Chesapeake Bay. The first event occurred in subdivisions behind a shopping center in California, where 30 homes sustained minor to moderate damage, mainly siding, shutters, and shingles. A few fences were blown down, with a portion of one residence's fence blown through another home's bedroom window. A roof was partially torn from a home, with some ceiling and deck damage. A shed reportedly was flipped onto an unoccupied automobile. Other cars were slightly damaged by fallen limbs. Approximately 20 trees were snapped. The second tornado was spawned in Charlotte Hall; the twister stripped off a large portion of a barn's sheet metal roof. A garage containing auto repair machinery collapsed, and an adjacent home's brick chimney was also toppled. Several trees were snapped or uprooted. Eight homes sustained minor damage, with three others suffering moderate to major damage.\n\nA third tornado struck extreme northwest Calvert County, causing the roof and a chimney of a predominantly wood-constructed farm house to collapse. The home was temporarily uninhabitable. At least one wall was near failure. A second chimney collapsed at a nearby home. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the path, and one home in an estates subdivision sustained damage to its gutters. Another tornado was spawned in Madison in Dorchester County, which is on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. The twister downed numerous trees and power lines blown down, resulting in scattered property damage and power outages. Strong winds felled trees and large limbs, damaging five homes in Calvert County. The combination of rain, gusty winds, and isolated severe weather left approximately 45,000 customers without electricity on the western shore. The Fenwick Island Buoy, which is just offshore along the Delaware-Maryland border, recorded a sustained wind speed of , while the highest gust observed was at Ocean City. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from and caused some street flooding in southeastern Maryland.\n\nAlong the coast of Delaware, tidal flooding was minor and occurred on Route 54 near Fenwick Island. Two days before Bertha arrived, rough surf resulted in 40 water rescues at Bethany Beach. Seashore state campgrounds were closed and shelters were set up, but less than 100 persons used them. Approximately of rain fell, while SKYWARN Spotters reported around of precipitation in Sussex County. This inundated some areas with poor drainage, though the only river to flood was the Christina River in New Castle County. Wind gusts reached in Dover. Throughout the state, 3,200 homes lost electricity, but many for only eight hours. At Bethany Beach, a few poles were snapped and tree limbs came down. Strong winds downed trees in Clayton, blocking three roads. The roof was blown off one house and the porch roof was blown off another. Several poles were also knocked down. Flying debris caused damage to several other garages, homes, and porches. Near Blackiston, a large storage shed was destroyed.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the storm brought wind gusts up to in the Philadelphia area. Winds downed weak trees and limbs, with one heavily damaging a house in Plymouth Township. Due to winds and severe thunderstorms associated with Bertha, approximately 60,000 customers lost electricity, primarily in Bucks County. Precipitation amounts between in 12 to 18 hours resulted in poor drainage flooding.\n\nTropical Storm Bertha passed through New Jersey on July 13, bringing wind gusts up to . Some tree limbs and weak trees were downed, closing Second Street in Cape May. Approximately 95,000 homes lost power. Rainfall totals averaged between , causing the Cooper River in Camden County, the Rockaway River in Morris County, and the Assunpink Creek at Trenton to overflow. However, since most of the rain fell during a 12‑ to 18‑hour period, there was mainly urban and poor drainage flooding. A few water rescues of trapped motorists occurred. Some minor tidal flooding occurred in Cape May County. Severe beach erosion was reported at Monmouth Beach, with of sand washed away.

Summer Nuclear Power Station occupies a site near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, in Fairfield County, South Carolina, approximately northwest of Columbia. The nuclear power station includes the decommissioned experimental Carolinas-Virginia Tube Reactor (CVTR) unit, just outside the site of the old town of Parr, SC. The CVTR was a 17 MWe, heavy water reactor. Its cooling water is supplied by the Monticello Reservoir, which is also used by a pumped storage (hydroelectric) unit. The plant utilizes a once-through cooling system.\n\nThis plant has one Westinghouse 3-loop Pressurized Water Reactor, which has received approval of a 20-year license extension, taking the license expiration of Unit 1 from 2022 to 2042. South Carolina Electric and Gas was also in the process of constructing two Westinghouse AP1000 plants, which had been scheduled to go into service in 2020, but construction on these was stopped in 2017.\n\nThe plant is named after Virgil Clifton Summer, the former Chairman and CEO of SCE&G.\n\nV. C. Summer Unit 1 is a Westinghouse 3-loop Pressurized Water Reactor. The reactor first began commercial operation on January 1, 1984. The plant cost $1.3 billion to construct – 24 percent less per kilowatt than the average of 13 nuclear plants constructed over the same time period.\n\nUnit 1 generates 2,900 MW (Thermal Megawatts) of heat, supplying a net output of 966 MW (Electric Megawatts) of electricity to the grid.\n\nIn 2001, the Summer unit operated at 79.9 percent of capacity, producing 6.76 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. In 2007 it produced 8.48 billion kilowatt-hours, increasing its capacity factor to 100.2 percent.\n\nAbout two-thirds (66.7 percent) of the Summer plant is owned by its operator, Dominion Energy. The remaining 33.3 percent is owned by the South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper).\n\nOn March 27, 2008, South Carolina Electric & Gas applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) to build two 1,100 MW AP1000 pressurized water reactors at the site. On May 27, 2008, SCE&G and Santee Cooper announced an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract had been reached with Westinghouse. Costs were estimated to be approximately $9.8 billion for both AP1000 units, plus transmission facility and financing costs. The operators are filing an application to increase customers bills by $1.2 billion (2.5%) during the construction period to partially finance capital costs.\n\nIn March 2012, the NRC approved the construction license of the two proposed reactors at the Summer plant. As with the license approval for the Vogtle plant, NRC chairman Gregory Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote, saying \"I continue to believe that we should require that all Fukushima-related safety enhancements are implemented before these new reactors begin operating\". The reactors were expected to go on-line in 2017 and 2018 respectively.\n\nThe construction of Unit 2 began officially on March 9, 2013, with the pouring of concrete for the base mat. The placement of the first concrete was completed on March 11, 2013. Unit 2 was the first reactor to start construction in the US in 30 years. First concrete for Unit 3 was completed on November 4, 2013.\n\nIn October 2014, a delay of at least one year and extra costs of $1.2 billion were announced, largely due to fabrication delays. Unit 2 was expected to be substantially complete in late 2018 or early 2019, with unit 3 about a year later.\n\nOn July 23, 2015, V.C. Summer Unit 2 reached a milestone with the successful placement of the CA-01 module, one of the largest, heaviest, and most complicated modules within the Nuclear Island, also referred to as a super module because it was so large that huge submodules had to be shipped from the manufacturer and final assembly was completed on site in the twelve-story Module Assembly Building. Installation of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It was the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds. Because of how much it weighs, lifting and placing the CA-01 module into the Unit 2 Nuclear Island resulted in the heaviest lift for the V.C. Summer construction project to date.\n\nIn early 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company revised in-service dates to April 2020 and December 2020 for units 2 and 3. In March 2017, Westinghouse Electric Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of $9 billion of losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects. SCANA considered its options for the project, and ultimately decided to abandon the project in July 2017. SCANA had determined that completing just Unit 2 and abandoning Unit 3 could be feasible and was leaning toward that option internally, however the project died when minority partner Santee Cooper's board voted to cease all construction and SCANA could not find another partner to take their place.\n\nOn July 31, 2017, after an extensive review into the costs of constructing Units 2 and 3, South Carolina Electric and Gas decided to stop construction of the reactors and later filed a Petition for Approval of Abandonment with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Summer was 17,599, an increase of 26.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,187,554, an increase of 14.3 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Columbia (30 miles to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Summer was 1 in 26,316, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nThe Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station consists of one operational reactor. Two additional units under construction were cancelled on July 31, 2017.\n"}

The first phase, a 51-storey skyscraper known as Bay Adelaide West, was completed in July 2009. The second phase, the 44-storey Bay Adelaide East, was completed in October 2016. A third tower, Bay Adelaide North, is planned.\n\nUpon completion, the Bay Adelaide Centre will consist of three towers.\n\nThe first tower, Bay Adelaide West, was completed in 2009 with a floor area of and a height of or 51 storeys. It is located on the northeast corner of Bay Street and Adelaide Street West.\n\nThe second tower, Bay Adelaide East, has a floor area of and a height of 44 storeys. Located mid-block between Adelaide Street West and Temperance Street, the tower has a 6-storey podium extending to the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Adelaide Street West.\n\nThe future Bay Adelaide North is anticipated to have a floor area of approximately and a height of 28 to 32 storeys. Unlike the two other towers in the complex, the north tower will be located on the north side of Temperance Street, with frontage along Richmond Street West. The Bay Adelaide North site is currently occupied by a one-storey elevator lobby which provides access to the underground concourse and garage.\n\nThe towers of the Bay Adelaide Centre are connected by an underground concourse, which extends under Temperance Street, and is connected to the PATH network. The underground concourse has PATH connections to Scotia Plaza to the south and Hudson's Bay Queen Street to the north. There is also a four-level underground garage under the complex, with vehicular access from both Adelaide Street West and Richmond Street West.\n\nThere is a public space, Arnell Plaza, located between Bay Adelaide West and Bay Adelaide East. Although Arnell Plaza is privately owned, public access has been legally secured by the City of Toronto. Cloud Gardens, a public park, is located immediately to the east of the Bay Adelaide North site on land conveyed to the City of Toronto as a condition of the original development approvals for the complex.\n\nThe complex's mechanical facilities are located in a four-storey above-grade building on the southwest corner of Yonge and Temperance Streets, with retail uses to be constructed at grade as part of the Bay Adelaide East construction. In order to accommodate the construction of the Bay Adelaide East podium, the historic facades of the former Elgin Block, constructed in 1850 and 1910 and once occupied by Holt Renfrew, were disassembled, refurbished and reconstructed as the facade of the mechanical facility building.\n\nBoth Bay Adelaide West and Bay Adelaide East are designed in a modernist style, although the historic north and west facades of the former National Building at the corner of Bay and Temperance Streets, completed in 1926, has been incorporated into Bay Adelaide West.\n\nThe first tower development on the site was a joint project by Markborough Properties and TrizecHahn: a 57-storey office tower to be constructed at the corner of Bay and Adelaide Streets. It was to have cost almost a billion dollars, and was the last of a series of construction projects in downtown Toronto launched in the boom years of the 1980s, when a number of massive towers were built nearby, such as Scotia Plaza.\n\nThe building caused considerable controversy among those opposed to the erection of such massive structures. The tower would have stood far higher than was allowed by the city's official plan. To gain city hall's approval, the developers committed some $80 million towards new social housing and other projects. A portion of the site was turned over to the city for use as a park that is now Cloud Gardens. Both of these deals went ahead, despite the tower never having been completed.\n\nConstruction began in 1990, but the developers soon ran into problems. The economy went into recession and office vacancy rates in Toronto rose to 20%. Construction was halted, and in 1993, with over $500 million already invested, the project was permanently put on hold. All that was completed was the underground parking garage and several storeys of the concrete service shaft that stood from 1991 onwards, as a monument to the failed project in downtown Toronto. The stump of the service shaft was known to security and the locals as \"the bunker\" or simply \"the stump\". The parking garage was in operation, and the stump itself was used as a surface on which to mount advertisements.\n\nThe exterior of the stump of the building was depicted as a nightclub in the opening scene of the 1996 comedy film \"Brain Candy\".\n\nThere were several attempts to revive the project. In 1998 TrizecHahn briefly revived it, but another shift in the economy caused them to again pause. In 2000 there was again talk of reviving the project, but the next year TrizecHahn sold its 50% share to Brookfield Properties for $49 million. Brookfield was committed to completing the structure to a smaller height of either 40 or 50 storeys, but later that year the economy again soured and the project remained on hiatus.\n\nIn October 2005, plans were filed with the City of Toronto to develop the property. An information sign (notice to amend the by law regulating zoning) was placed on Bay St. between 347 Bay and 355 Bay, both also Brookfield properties. The notice, in short, informed the public that three mixed-use high-rise towers surrounding an urban plaza will be built. The towers were then planned to vary in size from 43 to 50 storeys and contain an aggregate density of . Brookfield Properties had signed KPMG and Goodmans as anchor tenants for the first tower, Bay Adelaide West, with Fasken Martineau and Heenan Blaikie also taking up residence in the building.\n\nIn June 2006, both buildings on Bay Street attached to this property were emptied of tenants and by December 11, 2006, both buildings had been taken down, with the north and west facades of the National Building (347 Bay) being removed for incorporation into the new buildings. The National Building had only recently been designated a heritage building under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" (Part IV). By December 2006, dismantling of the service shaft stump was complete. Construction of the PATH tunnel north from Scotia Plaza through the Bay Adelaide Centre started in fall 2007. Completion of this section closed the last remaining gap in the north-south route through PATH that parallels Yonge Street, thus eliminating the need to double back from Bay Street to get between buildings located on the eastern edge of PATH.\n\nBay Adelaide West was completed in 2009 at 51 storeys. It played a primary role in the thriller \"Devil\" by M. Night Shyamalan, which was released on September 17, 2010. It is also featured extensively on TV show \"Suits\", being the fictional head office of the law firm Pearson Specter Litt.\n\nIn June 2012, Brookfield announced that it planned to commence construction of Bay Adelaide East at 44 storeys and , with Deloitte as the anchor tenant.\n\nIn August 2018, Brookfield announced that it planned to commence construction of Bay Adelaide North at 32 storeys and , with Scotiabank as the anchor tenant. The North tower will complete the three-million-square-foot Bay Adelaide Centre campus.\n\nThe development achieved LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold status for the project's environmental sustainability and will produce an estimated 40% energy savings relative to other buildings. The LEED rating system recognizes leading-edge buildings that incorporate design, construction and operational practices that combine healthy, high-quality and high-performance advantages with reduced environmental impacts.\n\nBay Adelaide Centre is the first mixed-use, commercial real estate building in North America to launch a mobile app aimed to communicate directly with tenants in the building.\n\n\n"}

The company began the 10-year process of decommissioning the site and will eventually haul away pieces of the plant to its property in Utah. During the decommissioning process, the used nuclear fuel was transferred from the spent fuel pool into dry casks and placed into a newly constructed Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI). The transfer procedures were completed in January 2015. The total cost of decommissioning is expected to reach approximately 1 billion dollars. After this is complete, Exelon will resume responsibility of the site, including the ISFSI.\n\nOn February 14, 2013, a small fire broke out at the shuttered Zion nuclear plant, but authorities said it was put out with one extinguisher and there were no radiation leaks or risks to the public. Workers involved in the decommissioning of the plant were using torches to cut bolts when some grease began to smoke and produce small flames, said Mark Walker of EnergySolutions, the contractor handling the decommissioning.\n\nThe power plant was the tallest structure in Lake County.\n\nA January 7, 2017 \"Chicago Sun-Times\" article reported that the closing of the nuclear plant strongly and negatively affected the City of Zion economically.\n\n"}

Its best-known product was the Exakta single-lens reflex camera.\n\nJohan Steenbergen, a Dutchman, founded a camera company called \"Industrie- und Handelsgesellschaft\" in Dresden in 1912. The name was shortened to Ihagee (based on the German pronunciation of the acronym IHG, ee-hah-geh). In 1918 six woodworkers joined Steenbergen at what was known from then on as, Ihagee Kamerawerk Steenbergen & Co.\n\nIhagee's most successful camera by far was the Exakta, which was produced between 1933 and 1976. The series began in 1933 with the Standard, or VP, Exakta, which used 127 rollfilm. This was followed in 1936 by the popular 35mm Kine Exakta. Ihagee also made a smaller, less complex, version of the Exakta called the Exa.\n\nThe company was greatly affected by World War II. Steenbergen left Dresden in 1942, never to return, and the Ihagee factory was destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in April 1945. The partitioning of Germany after the war left Dresden and Ihagee in the Soviet occupation zone, later East Germany. The Soviet Union quickly reestablished Ihagee, producing some Exakta and Exa cameras from the parts and machinery that had survived the bombing. The company was taken over by Pentacon, the maker of the successful Praktica camera, in 1951.\n\nSteenbergen returned to West Germany and created a new company in 1959 which was called Ihagee West and had its headquarters in Frankfurt. In 1966 the company marketed its own camera, the Exakta real, without much success. After Steenbergen's death in 1967, Ihagee West ordered and sold the Exakta TwinTL, which was built by Cosina. The company was dissolved in 1976.\n\nIhagee in Dresden was very successful in the development and sales of the Exakta SLR. In 1970, however, the company was completely absorbed by Pentacon and camera production under the Ihagee nameplate ceased. The last Exakta model, the RTL 1000, was a cooperative effort with Pentacon. It is possible that the Ihagee company still exists on paper.\n\nSince 1997 the Steenbergen Foundation (Steenbergen Stichting) in The Hague, The Netherlands commemorates Johan Steenbergen by awarding the Steenbergen Stipendium to a graduate of one of the Dutch photo academies, and to a university graduate, supporting a study of a historical aspect of the Dutch province of Drenthe, birthplace of Steenbergen.\n\n"}

His son also wrestled as Perro Aguayo Jr. or El Hijo del Perro Aguayo (\"The Son of Perro Aguayo\"). He was one of the biggest box office attractions in lucha libre history and was the last major rival of El Santo. Often prone to blading, Aguayo has been described by American pundits as a cross between Terry Funk and Bruno Sammartino (for his willingness to brawl and overpower opponents). He was the first person ever crowned the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion, though pre-1997 title reigns are not included in WWE's official history for that title. In 2012, Aguayo was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame.\n\nAguayo was synonymous with the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) as one of its top heels and one of the top heels lucha libre overall. In the 1990s, Aguayo helped found Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later known simply as AAA, and his three-way feud with Konnan and Cien Caras proved to be one of the most successful programs in terms of box office receipts. He stayed with AAA until 2000, even making an appearance on WWF's Royal Rumble in 1997 in a match that featured lucha libre legends like El Canek, Mil Máscaras and up and comers who would later make names for themselves like Héctor Garza and Heavy Metal.

{"id": "1806338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806338", "title": "Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt", "text": "Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt\n\nThe Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt (notated Dynasty XXIII, alternatively 23rd Dynasty or Dynasty 23) is usually classified as the third dynasty of the ancient Egyptian Third Intermediate Period. This dynasty consisted of a number of Meshwesh ancient Libyan (Berber) kings, who ruled either as pharaohs or independent kings of parts of Upper Egypt from 880 BC to 720 BC, and pharaohs from 837 BC to 728 BC.\n\nThere is much debate surrounding this dynasty, which may have been situated at Herakleopolis Magna, Hermopolis Magna, and Thebes. Monuments from their reign show that they controlled Upper Egypt in parallel with the Twenty-second dynasty, shortly before the death of Osorkon II.\n\nWhile the Twenty-third Dynasty is considered a Tanite dynasty, as in originating from the city Tanis, it never reigned from there. The Twenty-second Dynasty, coming from Bubastis, took over Tanis and Memphis and managed to retain these cities almost until the end of their Dynasty. As a result, the Twenty-third Dynasty, being more or less an offshoot of the Twenty-second Dynasty, originated from Tanis. Instead, as mentioned above, most historians argue that they used Leontopolis as their capital. This is confirmed by Piankhy's stela, which locates Iuput II in Leontopolis. However, some historians argue that Iuput II should not be considered a Twenty-third Dynasty king at all, as it has not been undoubtedly proven that the Twenty-third Dynasty ruled from Leontopolis, merely that Iuput II ruled from somewhere in the Delta. And if Iuput II is the only connection between the Twenty-third Dynasty and Leontopolis, this viewpoint would eliminate Piankhy's stela as proof for Leontopolis being the capital of the Twenty-third Dynasty.\n\nAnother reason why there is much debate is because next to the conflicts between Lower and Upper Egypt that existed, there were now also conflicts in the Delta itself. Part of these conflicts were succession struggles, but another part of it were High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who for a period during the Twenty-first Dynasty effectively ruled Upper Egypt, despite not being regarded as a separate dynasty (however, some did become pharaoh as part of a dynasty, like Psusennes I). Although their power declined after the Twenty-first Dynasty, the High Priests of Amun remained powerful and influential people, and marriages into the royal family were not unusual. As a result, multiple reigns within the Twenty-third Dynasty as well as between the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Dynasties overlap. This is because some members of the Twenty-third Dynasty reigned as independent kings (like Harsiese A), and as a separate dynasty after Osorkon II’s (of the Twenty-second Dynasty) death. Some historians argue that the Twenty-third Dynasty started with Takelot II, and consider Pedubastis I as a separate independent (and short lived) part of that Dynasty. Others consider Takelot II's line as a separate independent part of the Twenty-second Dynasty, and consider Pedubastis I's short lived line as the Twenty-third Dynasty.\n\nWhen Osorkon II died, crown prince Shoshenq had already died, so his younger brother, Takelot II, took the throne at Tanis. High priest of Amun at that moment in time was Nimlot, Takelot II's half-brother. Nimlot was appointed by Osorkon II, and Nimlot married his own daughter, Karomama Merytmut II, to Takelot II. As a result, Nimlot would be grandfather of any children, and thus heirs to the throne, Takelot II would get. When Nimlot died in the eleventh year of Takelot II, a fight for his succession broke out. Takelot II chose prince Osorkon, but Harsiese, grandson of the chief priest, did not agree. Thebes revolted at his hand, but prince Osorkon managed to crush the revolt.\n\nThis relative peace lasted four years, as in Takelot II's fifteenth year a civil war broke out. This conflict lasted for almost ten years, and after another two years of relative peace, the Thebans once again revolted. Takelot II died before this new conflict was resolved, and with prince Osorkon far from Tanis, his younger brother Shoshenq III seized power. While this helped in resolving the conflict with Thebes, because they accepted Shoshenq III as king, a new conflict started. Instead of a conflict between royal families, this was from within the royal family. Prince Pedubastis proclaimed himself king, and reigned from Leontopolis, simultaneously with Shoshenq III.\n\nWhile prince Osorkon did get usurped by his brother Shoshenq III, Shoshenq did reappoint him as chief priest of Amun. Because Harsiese, the one from the Theban revolt mentioned before, disappeared in the twenty-ninth year of Shoshenq III's reign, prince Osorkon effectively controlled Upper Egypt for about a decade as chief priest of Amun. Meanwhile, Shoshenq III was and remained more powerful than the kings in Leontopolis. By this time, Pedubastis and his son Iuput, who he had appointed as co-regent, had already died, seemingly in the same year (804 BC). Shoshenq IV had succeeded Pedubastis, but not for long as prince Osorkon succeeded him six years later as Osorkon III, reigning simultaneously with Shoshenq III for the last years of his reign.\n\nAt Herakleopolis a Twenty-second Dynasty king was still in power in the name of Shoshenq V around 766 BC. However, Osorkon III installed his eldest son Takelot there, also allowing him to be chief priest of Amun at the same time. As a result, the Twenty-second Dynasty's role in the Theban area was greatly reduced. When Osorkon III died, Takelot had already co-reigned with his father, and was thus now sole ruler.\n\nTakelot III had given up his role as chief priest when he became pharaoh, and his sister, Shepenwepet I, seems to have taken over that role, as well as being appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. As a result, she effectively ruled over the Theban region together with her brother. Takelot III also gave up his rule of Herakleopolis, to Peftjauawhybastet, who was married to a daughter of Rudamon, Takelot's brother. Rudamon succeeded Takelot III, but shortly after was already succeeded by Iuput II (also known as Ini/Iny). Under his reign the region became more divided again, as Peftjauawybastet and Nimlot, governor of Hermopolis, adopted royal titles. Rudamon and Iuput II only reigned over Thebes in the final phase of the Twenty-third Dynasty, as Piankhy, king of Napata, put an end to the so-called ‘Libyan anarchy’.\n\n"}

It is east of the region capital Plzeň on the confluence of the River Klabava and the Holoubkov Brook (). Alternatively, the Holoubkovský potok is referred to as the Borecký potok and the section of the Klabava River down to the confluence as the Padrťský potok. There is another smaller brook (Rakovský potok or Rakováček) in the western part of the town.\n\nThe town is in the lowland, above sea level, bordered by hilly woodlands, especially the Brdy mountains to the east and the Radeč massif.\n\nRokycany is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence and Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority.\n\nThe place was inhabited since the Stone Age. Celtic and early Slavic settlements were discovered. Rokycany was first mentioned in 1110. At that time the village owned by the Bishop of Prague, and major Bohemian and German noblemen met here for diplomatic talks with Emperor Henry V. In 1295 a stockade fortifications in Rokycany are mentioned (probably defending the district around the main church). Major changes occurred in the 14th century when the village grew into a town, and a new western part of the settlement with rectangular grid was added. In the 14th century, the main church rebuilt in Gothic style and by 1399 system of town fortification is mentioned. Rokycany took an active role in Hussite movement. Master John of Rokycan (1397—1471), Archbishop of Prague, active during Hussite Wars was born here. In 1406 Rokycany obtained city rights. In the 16th century Rokycany was given rights as \"free King's city\" in 1584 making it self-administered entity. The prosperity came to an abrupt end with the Thirty Years' War. Rokycany was repeatedly afflicted by various armies, most notably by the Swedish army led by Banner who completely burned the town. By the end of the war Rokycany's population decreased to 774. Another period of prosperity started in the 18th century. Town was partially destroyed by fire in 1757 (52 houses damaged) and completely destroyed by another fire in 1784 (260 houses damaged). After the fire, the townhall and main church had to be rebuilt, as well as most of the private houses. Thanks to favorable economic conditions of the residents the post-1784 renewal proceeded rather quickly. In the 19th century craft and industry became main source of Rokycany's economy. The traditional iron-ore mining and processing industry was strengthened and linked with coal mining industry in nearby Mirošov (Rokycany District) basin. In 1862 Rokycany was connected via railway with Prague and Plzeň. Industrial development continued for most of the 20th century. Population grew (from 4,187 in 1869 to more than 16,000 in the late 1980s) and the town expanded with new neighborhoods, some of them inspired by concepts of Garden city movement (Rašínov neighborhood in the southern outskirts). On May 7, 1945 Rokycany was liberated by the American army which halted its eastward advance here, meeting with the allied Soviet troops in the eastern part of the town (creating so-called Demarcation line). In the post-World War II era, the development of the town was carried out in line with the ruling communist regime. The new massive construction activity focused on uniform tenement houses, from 1960s built with concrete panels (so-called \"panelák\"). The local industry was further expanded and the life of the town was strongly influenced by strong army garrison (located in two barracks built in 1899 and 1933 respectively). In 1960 neighboring village Borek was merged with Rokycany, in 1980 another three rural communities (Kamenný Újezd (Rokycany District), Litohlavy, Svojkovice (Rokycany District)) joined Rokycany (however all 3 have separated in the 1990s)\n\nRokycany is divided into four districts: \"Střed\" (Center), \"Nové Město\" (New Town), \"Plzeňské předměstí\" (Plzeň Suburb) and \"Borek\".\n\nStřed encompasses the historical core of the town with two main squares, main church of Panna Marie Sněžná and town-hall. Since 1992 the historical core of Rokycany has been declared protected zone in order to protect the architecture. The border of this district largely follows the path of former town's fortification. The medieval walls are still standing in several short sections. On the southern side the walls have been replaced by a representative avenue (Jiráskova ulice) with several major public buildings such as \"sokolovna\" (Sokol organization headquarters) from 1903, new railway-station from 1931, gymnázium (grammar-school) from 1905 or municipal bank from 1933.\n\nNové Město is by far most populous district surrounding the historical core from north, east and south. It evolved from traditional \"Pražské předměstí suburb\" which was located on both banks of the Klabava river along the road to Prague (Pražská ulice) and Nerudovo náměstí square. After World War II most of the old suburb was demolished and replaced by several housing projects. With the population growth the built-up area of Nové Město expanded in all directions. There are thus several distinct modern neighborhoods. \"Práchovna\" is located in the southeastern section of Rokycany on the banks of the Klabava River. Several industrial estates and colony of cheap tenement houses for local workers from early 20th century form most of Práchovna. \"Páclovna\" is situated along the road to Prague on Rokycany's eastern outskirts. It mainly consists of private houses, the Demarcation line memorial is located here (commemorating the meeting of American and Russian troops that occurred here in 1945), \"Osecký vrch\" lies in the north along the road to the village of Osek. In 1957 large hospital was built here. There are large parks covering the surrounding slopes (Husovy sady and Kalvárie) and large complex of town swimming-pool and football stadium. \"Jižní předměstí\" covers territory south of the Prague-Plzeň railway. It consists of several industrial zones and populous housing projects from the 1950s and 1970s. The military barracks built in 1933 have been converted into a residential and industrial zone recently.\n\nPlzeňské předměstí forms western part of Rokycany. It started in medieval era as a small cluster of rural houses adjoining Rokycany's historical core. In early 17th century Protestant church Nejsvětější Trojice was built here, soon after taken by Catholics. In 19th century Plzeňské předměstí quickly grew along the road to Plzeň (Plzeňská ulice), mainly industrial development was later accompanied by residential houses. In 1920s massive housing project started on Rokycany's southern outskirts. The new neighbourhood was later called \"Rašínov\" (Alois Rašín was finance minister of Czechoslovakia, assassinated in 1923). In consists solely of private houses in art-deco style. In 1930's another neighborhood was inaugurated in the western periphery, called \"Za Rakováčkem\". It also features almost exclusively private residential houses.\n\nBorek used to be an independent village located ca.2 km east of Rokycany. In 1960 Borek came under the jurisdiction of Rokycany. The Borecký rybník lake is most notorious landmark of this district. In the 20th century the built-up area of Borek expanded amalgamating the village with Rokycany.\n\nIn 19th century Rokycany's population quickly expanded pushing the number of inhabitants towards 5,000 in 1880. In the wake of Long Depression (economic slowdown of the 1870s which affected the economy of Austria-Hungary) the growth stopped. In late 1890s however population began to expand again, only to halt during World War I. In post-1918 era Rokycany grew rapidly. In the late 1930s this growth was further spurred by influx of ethnic Czech refugees from Sudetenland. In 1939 Rokycany's population touched 10,000 mark briefly. After World War II many citizens of Rokycany left the town for border regions from where the ethnic Germans were expelled. From the 1950s a new wave of massive growth started, pushing the town's population past 10,000 in the mid 1950s and past 15,000 in the 1980s. Demographic maximum was reached in 1989 with more than 16,000 inhabitants. Since that time the population dropped to ca. 14,000 as a result of economic a social transition and also of separation of 3 villages from the community of Rokycany.\n\nEthnically, Rokycany has been a predominately Czech settlement since Middle Ages. The German minority accounted for no more than couple of dozens individuals. In 1938 the town's population was boosted by influx of ethnic Czechs fleeing the border regions of Czechoslovakia which had been ceded to Nazi Germany. After 1945 most ethnic Germans were expelled. The ethnic mix of Rokycany was in the post-World War II era enriched by Romas (Gypsies) and Slovaks.\n\nRokycany hosts Fluff Fest, a vegan hardcore punk festival which draws several thousand visitors from across Europe every July. It is held at the Rokycany airfield, having moved there in 2006 from its original location in Plzeň. The festival has been described as a yearly \"strain\" on the town, which is otherwise unaccustomed to large numbers of foreign visitors and extreme music adherents, and brings a business boom especially in sales of vegetarian and vegan food.\n\n\nRokycany is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

In June 1341, he became sultan, the first of several sons of an-Nasir Muhammad to accede the throne. However, his reign was short-lived; in August, Abu Bakr was deposed and arrested by his father's senior emir, Qawsun. Abu Bakr was imprisoned in the Upper Egyptian city of Qus, along with several of his brothers, and executed on Qawsun's orders two months later.

This would be punctured with short periods of peace in which the persecution would temporarily drop in intensity.\n\nIn his days, as characteristic of the entire period, the Copts suffered from a great deal of persecution. However, the time of Pope Peter V was a time of relative peace compared to the general atmosphere of the era.\n\nIn one incidence, in May 1341, in the last days of the reign of Al-Sultan Al-Nasser (he died 7 June 1341 AD), the Sultan ordered a ban on a celebration that the Christians held annually on the 8th of Bashans (May) in the Shubra district. The celebration was known as the feast of the Martyr.\n\nIn another incidence, an Islamic judge in one of the cities had imprisoned a Copt, claiming that his grandfather was not a Christian and he wanted him to convert to Islam. He refused and the Copts stormed the prison and brought him out. The city became violent against the Copts. The rioters desecrated the tombs of the Copts and burned the bodies of the dead. As the city descended into disarray, its governor lodged a complaint with the Sultan of Egypt, who removed the Islamic judge.\n\nAlso in the final two years of the episcopate of Pope Peter V, in June 1348 AD, a persecution of the Christians broke out in Cairo.\n\nPope Peter V consecrated the Holy Oil of Chrismation (Miron) twice.\n\nIn the third year of his episcopate (1342 AD, 1058 AM), Pope Peter V consecrated the Holy Oil (Miron) in the monastery of St Macarius in the Nitrian Desert (the monastery of Abu Makar) with twelve bishops. As with the Coptic Custom of the day, the consecration of the Holy Oil was held at the Monastery of St Macarius in the final days of Lent (April 1342 AD). The bishops consecrated the Holy Miron on the Great Thursday (April 1342, Baramhat 1058 AD). Among those who attended the consecration with the twelve bishops were a priest named Rev. father Assaad Faraj Allah (القس الأسعد فرج الله ابن القس الأكرم قسيس المعلقة الشيخ المعلم يوحنا بن أخ البابا يوأنس الثامن البطريرك). Another priest and monk who also attended the consecration of the Chrismation Oil were Rev Fr. Gabriel who later succeeded Pope Peter V to the episcopal throne as Pope Mark IV (Episcopate 1348-1363).\n\nIn the seventh year of his episcopate (1346 AD, 1062 AM), Pope Peter V consecrated the Oil of Chrismation (Miron) for the second time.\n\nAfter the pope's return from the Scetis to Cairo following the consecration of the Holy Oil in April 1346 AD, a persecution of the Christians broke out in Cairo, and it lasted for about two years until Pope Peter V departed this world on 6 July 1348 AD.\n"}

It is owned and operated by Energy Northwest, a Washington state, not-for-profit joint operating agency. Licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1983, Columbia first produced electricity in May 1984, and entered commercial operation in December 1984.\n\nColumbia produces 1,107 megawatts net of electricity, which is about 10 percent of the electricity generated in Washington state.\n\nColumbia Generating Station is a BWR-5. It features a Mark II containment structure.\n\nThe reactor core holds up to 764 fuel assemblies, and 185 control rods, more technically known as control blades. The reactor is licensed for a power output of 3486 thermal megawatts\n(MWt). The gross electrical output of the plant is 1230 megawatts-electric\n(MWe).\n\nThe Columbia Generating Station features six low-profile fan-driven cooling towers. Each tower cascades clean warmed water, a byproduct of water heat exchanging with steam after leaving a turbine, down itself and subsequently cools the warmed water via a combination of evaporation and heat exchange with the surrounding air. Some water droplets fall back to earth in the process, thereby creating a hoar frost in the winter. At times, the vapor cloud from the cooling towers can reach in height and can be seen at a great distance. Replacement water for the evaporated water is drawn from the nearby Columbia River.\n\nColumbia was built by the former Washington Public Power Supply System, known since 1998 as Energy Northwest. Its construction permit was issued in March 1973, and construction began in late 1975. Because of cost overruns and construction delays, the plant did not begin commercial operation until December 1984. Of the five commercial reactors originally planned by the Bonneville Power Administration and the Supply System in Washington, Columbia was the only one completed. The nuclear power plant was also known as Hanford Two, with Hanford One being the 800 MWe power generating plant connected to the N-Reactor (decommissioned in 1987), a dual purpose reactor operated by the Atomic Energy Commission: producing plutonium for the nuclear weapons stockpile, as well as generating electricity for the grid. \n\nWhen the Supply System changed its name to Energy Northwest, the plant's name went from WNP-2 (Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Project number 2) to Columbia Generating Station. In 2000, then-Executive Board Chairman Rudi Bertschi said the plant's former name referred \"to an earlier era when the Washington Public Power Supply System was building five nuclear power plants. Those days are long gone,\" said Bertschi. \"Our plant has made the transition, as has Energy Northwest, from being a marginal producer to being a key cog in the region's energy machine.\"\n\nColumbia's original NRC license to operate was scheduled to expire in December 2023. In January 2010, Energy Northwest filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license renewal – through 2043. In May 2012, the NRC approved the 20-year license renewal.\n\nIn 2012, Energy Northwest entered into agreements with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and the Department of Energy to turn depleted uranium (also called uranium tails) into low-cost enriched uranium product for further future processing into nuclear fuel. Buying under market value at a set price to obtain a nine-year fuel supply, the transaction is estimated to bring between $171 and $275 million in savings to the region through 2028.\n\nIn late 2012, the Bonneville Power Administration and Energy Northwest came together to analyze the financial value of Columbia in light of low energy prices in the wholesale electricity market and historic low fuel costs for natural gas-fired power plants. The agencies studied three scenarios and concluded, in April 2013, that Columbia's continued operation was the most cost-effective option for consumers.\n\nIn April 2013, Energy Northwest commissioned a third-party study by IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a firm with a 75-year reputation for independent expertise in the fields of energy, economics, market conditions and business risk. IHS CERA came to the same conclusion as the April 2013 joint BPA-EN study.\n\nIn 2013, the Columbia Generating Station set a record for electricity generation during a refueling outage year – 8.4 million megawatt hours of electricity sent to the regional power grid. In 2012 – a non-refueling outage year – Columbia generated a record 9.3 million megawatt hours of electricity for the regional power grid (95% capacity factor).\n\nIn January 2014, the Public Power Council, representing Northwest consumer-owned utilities, examined the competing market assessments and said they found no compelling evidence that ceasing operation of Columbia is economically advisable for the region. The PPC assessment supported public statements by BPA affirming Columbia's provision of unique, firm, baseload, non-carbon emitting generation with predictable costs for the region's ratepayers.\n\nThe Public Power Council observed in February 2014 that the variable cost of Columbia operations in recent years were slightly above spot market energy prices. However, the council stated that a single unanticipated shift in the markets \"can easily wipe out years of anticipated benefits\" gained from replacement power.\n\nThe council referenced the Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001. During that relatively short energy crisis, according to the council, the cost benefit of Columbia's power \"dwarf[ed] the modest benefits that would have been achieved\" through replacement power. \"In 2001 alone the operation of Columbia Generating Station compared to the market saved Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers $1.4 billion,\" according to the council.\n\nColumbia Generating Station's spent fuel pool is able to accommodate 2,658 fuel assemblies. It was designed as a short-term storage option until a national repository could be built. Since there is no projected operations start date for the proposed but stalled national long-term nuclear waste storage facility at Yucca Mountain Repository in Nevada, the station obtained approval for dry-cask storage to avoid exceeding the pool's licensed capacity. The Columbia Generating Station has an on-site dry cask storage installation, which allows for storage of spent fuel rods in specially designed and manufactured casks. As of 2014, 36 casks have been loaded and stored in the installation, making room in the spent fuel pool for receipt of new fuel.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactive materials.\n\nThe 2010 population within of Columbia was 10,055, an increase of 10.4 percent in a decade. The 2010 population within was 445,416, an increase of 23.4 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Richland ( to city center) and Pasco ( to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Columbia was 1 in 47,619, according to an NRC study published in August 2010. The Department of Energy is planning a new earthquake assessment that will update the last comprehensive one conducted in 1996. The U.S. Geological Survey has shown that the active faults of the Puget Sound Region are connected to ridges in the Mid-Columbia by faults that cross the Cascades (see ).\n\nAccording to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Columbia Generating Station site is a \"Dry Site\" since the plant is above the Design Basis Flood Line.\n\n\n"}

He was the first president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and, at the time of his death, was president of the American Social Science Association. \n\nHe first attracted attention with the reflective sketches in \"My Summer in a Garden\" (1870). First published as a series in \"The Hartford Courant\", these sketches were popular for their abounding and refined humor and mellow personal charm, their love of the outdoors, their suggestive comment on life and affairs, and their delicately finished style, qualities that suggested the work of Washington Irving. In 1873, the work Warner is known for today, the novel he wrote with Mark Twain, was published. Called \"\", it gave that era of American history its name.\n\nCharles Dudley Warner is known for making the famous remark, Quoted by Mark Twain in one of his many humorous lectures, Warner's quip is still commonly misattributed to Twain.\n\nThe citizens of San Diego so appreciated Warner's flattering description of their city in his book \"Our Italy\" that they named three consecutive streets in the Point Loma neighborhood after him: Charles Street, Dudley Street, and Warner Street.\n\n\nHe edited \"The American Men of Letters\" series, to which he contributed an excellent biography of Washington Irving (1881), and also edited a large \"Library of the World's Best Literature\" (1897).

The other 10% is owned by Cooperative Energy.\n\nAdjacent to the operating Grand Gulf station, is an unfinished concrete structure that was to be the containment for Unit 2, a twin to the existing Unit 1. In December 1979, staggered by construction cost, Entergy (then called Middle South Utilities) stopped work on Unit 2.\n\nOn September 22, 2005, it was announced that Grand Gulf had been selected as the site for a GE ESBWR reactor. For details, see Nuclear Power 2010 Program. This was to be Unit 3.\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an Early Site Permit (ESP) to Grand Gulf.\nIn 2008, Entergy and NuStart submitted a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) application for a potential new nuclear unit at the Grand Gulf.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, Entergy indefinitely postponed work towards the license and construction of Unit 3.

The organization was founded on 24 December 1961 in Washington, D.C.. PERMIAS is an Indonesian acronym for \"Persatuan Mahasiswa Indonesia Seluruh Amerika Serikat\". Translated into English, it means \"Organization of the Indonesian Students in the United States\". The group organizes many annual events and competitions for Indonesian students in the US.\n\nSometimes \"Permias\" is also called ISA, which stands for Indonesian Student Association (equivalent to PPI - \"Persatuan Pelajar Indonesia\" - which is the organization that unites Indonesian college students in other countries such as in the United Kingdom). The difference usually is that ISA only accepting members from certain institutes / universities, whereas \"Permias\" is more loosely accepting members from schools within the region - and sometimes even non-students like alumni.\n\nEvery Permias chapter stands for itself and rarely has any ties with other Permias groups except for the Permias National Chapter. The Permias National Chapter is the head of all the regional Permias Chapter. The representatives of each Permias Chapter is encouraged to meet in the Permias National Congress which is scheduled to happen every 2–3 years. The first National Congress was the Congress of Indonesian Diaspora.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the decreasing amount of Indonesian Student Population in the United States, Permias National have some inconsistency of holding the National Congress. The decline of the student population is mostly caused by the financial crisis in 1998/1999. However, the trend today shows a constant increase Indonesian Student Population. In 2011/2012 academic year, there are about 7,131 Indonesian Students in the United States. Although, it looks like an increasing number, it is still far from the peak number of Indonesian Students during the 1997/1998 academic year that is 13,828 students. The current growth of Indonesian student population is said to be about 2.7%/ year.\n\nThe first National Congress did after the long hiatus was on May 25, 2013, in Washington D.C. called the Permias Congress 2013. The following National Congress was held on May 23, 2015 in New York City.\n\nAnother big event held by Permias National is the Permias National Cup. The Permias National Cup is a sports event where each region (east, west, midwest) of Permias chapters competes against each other in Basketball and Soccer Tournaments. The winner from each region (1st and 2nd winner) get to compete in the Permias National Cup. The first Permias National Cup was held in Chicago in 2014. The teams that compete in the Basketball Tournament were Madison, Purdue, Chicago, Massachusetts, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City. For the Futsal Tournament, there were Penn State, Purdue, Chicago & Milwaukee, Urbana-Champaign, Massachusetts, Los Angeles, DC, Seattle and New York City. The next Permias National Cup will be held in around February 2016 at Seattle.\n\nThere is no exact data on how many \"Permias\" / ISA are in U.S., as there is no annual meeting between local organizations' officers or the like. Some of them have their own student-maintained websites, some used to have one, and some don't have the manpower to create one.\n\nThe Permias National is led by a Secretary General followed by a Deputy Secretary General. There are also several committees of the Permias National that includes Communication, Social, Cultural, Academic, Finance and Administration. Also, there are representatives of each Permias Chapters, who served on the council. The council is led by the Secretary General and the Deputy Secretary General, whereas the Committees are a separate entity that is supervised by the Council.

It was located just northeast of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and west of its suburb of Brandon. It was named for the 19th century explorer John C. \"Pathfinder\" Fremont and was constructed in the mid-1960s in partnership with a group of other investor-owned utilities. The main goal of this facility was to be a 'proof of concept' plant to gain practical experience in operating a nuclear plant. Some of the other participating utilities would also go on to build their own plants. Although the superheater developed by Allis-Chalmers was plagued with technical difficulties and which led to NSP's eventual decision to retire the reactor by 1967 (and convert the plant to run on gas and oil by 1968), the lessons NSP learned from Pathfinder served the company in its operation of the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants. The longest Pathfinder ever ran at its full rated power was 30 minutes, and it was only then the company found the flaws that led to the decision to retire the reactor. After sitting idle for 23 years, the reactor vessel was removed from the plant in 1990 and transported to a low-level radioactive material dump in Washington.\n\nPathfinder would continue as an oil- or gas-fired peaking plant until it was retired in the early 2000s after its cooling tower collapsed in July 2000. In 1994 the Angus C. Anson Generating Station was built at the same site. Its namesake was NSP's South Dakota division manager Angus C. Anson (1954–1993), who was killed in the plane crash that also killed South Dakota governor George S. Mickelson.\n\n\nNSP: An Illustrated History of Northern States Power Company (NSP, 1999)\n"}
{"id": "1806412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806412", "title": "Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station", "text": "Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station\n\nThe Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station is a shut-down nuclear power plant located on between Fort Calhoun, and Blair, Nebraska adjacent to the Missouri River between mile markers 645.6 and 646.0. The utility has an easement for another which is maintained in a natural state. The power plant is owned by the Omaha Public Power District of Omaha, Nebraska. When operational, the plant accounted for 25 percent of OPPD's net generation capabilities.\n\nThe plant's single Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor generated 484 megawatts of electricity. This was the smallest rated capacity among all operating commercial power reactors in North America, and as a single-unit plant, this also qualified it as the smallest rated capacity nuclear power plant. OPPD's two Nebraska City coal-fired plants at 682 (opened 2009) and 649 (opened 1979) MW are both significantly larger.\n\nFort Calhoun houses spent fuel rods in a deep spent fuel pool next to the reactor, and when the pool had nearly reached capacity in 2006, OPPD began to store spent fuel rods above ground in dry cask storage as well. In total, the Ft. Calhoun reactor has of high level nuclear waste. The storage was not designed to house spent fuel permanently, but when plans for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository were terminated, OPPD stated that they are \"prepared to safely store material on-site as long as necessary\".\n\nThe plant underwent refurbishment in 2006 by having its steam generators, pressurizer, reactor vessel head, low pressure turbines and main transformer replaced. In 2003, the plant had its operating license renewed for an additional twenty years. With the renewal, the license for Fort Calhoun was extended from August 9, 2013, to August 9, 2033.\n\nThe 2011 Missouri River floods surrounded the plant with flood water. The nuclear reactor had been shut down and defueled in April 2011 for scheduled refueling. A fire caused electricity to shut off in the spent fuel pools resulting in 90 minutes without cooling qualifying as a \"red event\", signifying a high-level threat to Fort Calhoun operations. The flood and resulting fire was called \"one of the most serious safety incidents in recent years\" and resulted in a three-year cold shut-down of the plant.\n\nIn August 2012 OPPD signed a deal for Exelon Nuclear Partners to manage the plant although OPPD would maintain ownership. In February 2017, OPPD ended the service contract with Exelon by paying a $5 million fee, but will also be subject to \"wind-down\" fees.\n\nThe plant was shut down on October 24, 2016.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of about , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. In 2010, the population within 10 miles of Fort Calhoun was 20,639; the population within 50 miles was 953,410. The closest major city is Omaha, with a population of 408,958, whose center is from the plant.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Fort Calhoun was 1 in 76,923, according to a NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nA flood assessment performed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2010 indicated that the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station, \"did not have adequate procedures to protect the intake structure and auxiliary building against external flooding events.\" The assessment also indicated that the facility was not adequately prepared for a \"worst-case\" flooding scenario. A number of potential flood water penetration points were discovered that could have impacted the raw feed water supply to the cooling system, the auxiliary water supply and main switchgear (electrical) room. By early 2011, corrective measures had been implemented. In 2009 the NRC did a flood risk assessment which found that the protection measures were only designed to handle floods to above sea level which was below the NRC mandated elevation of for the plant. The risk assessment stated that at , flooding would have \"led to a 100 percent chance of a fuel damage if the emergency gasoline pumps didn't work.\"\n\nOn June 6, 2011 the Omaha Public Power District, as required by Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines, declared a Notification of Unusual Event (minimal level on a 4 level taxonomy) due to flooding of the Missouri River. The Missouri River was above flood stage and expected to rise further, and to remain above flood stage for several weeks to a month. Contractors installed sandbags and earthen berms to protect the facility from flooding. According to officials, the plant was built to withstand a 500 year flooding event and, though by June 14 much of the facility was surrounded by the swollen Missouri River, Omaha Public Power District officials said they were confident that enough redundancies were in place to ensure adequate safety. It was reported on June 17, 2011 that the plant was in \"safe cold shutdown\" mode for refueling and the anticipation of flooding, and that four weeks' worth of additional fuel had been brought in to power backup generators, should they be needed. The Army Corps of Engineers indicated that with average precipitation, the Missouri River would not go above above sea level and OPPD officials stated that the current flood protection efforts would protect the plant to feet above sea level. Officials indicated the spent fuel pool is at above sea level.\n\nOn June 7, 2011, an electrical component in a switch gear room caused a small fire with Halon extinguisher activation which forced a partial evacuation. The fire was no longer burning when the on site fire brigade arrived and according to officials, the public was never in any danger. The fire impacted pumping of coolant water through the spent fuel pool. Cooling was interrupted for an hour and a half while the estimated time for the pool to reach boiling temperature was over 88 hours. In response, the Omaha Public Power District declared an alert (second level on a 4 level taxonomy). The evacuation was the first at the facility since 1992, when (ca. 76 t) of coolant leaked into a containment building from the reactor.\n\nOn June 23 a helicopter contracted by OPPD to survey transmission lines made an unplanned landing south of the plant. Reports described it as an unplanned landing although photographs showed it on its side in a field. Nobody was injured. The Federal Aviation Administration had declared a \"temporary flight restriction,\" in a radius, centered on the Fort Calhoun nuclear facility. This restriction went into effect on June 6, 2011, at 4:31 PM, and remains in effect \"until further notice.\" Officials noted that the June 6 FAA directive was actually a reminder to a standing order creating no flight zones over all U.S. nuclear power plants which had been in effect after the 2001 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn June 26, at 1:30 a.m., a high, long water filled rubber \"flood berm\" that surrounded portions of the plant was punctured by a small earth mover (\"Bobcat\") and collapsed. The collapse of the flood berm allowed flood waters to surround the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, and also forced the temporary transfer of power from the external electricity grid to backup electrical generators. It was reported more than of water rushed in around buildings and electrical transformers. Backup generators were then used to ensure the facility maintained electrical power for cooling. The rupturing of the flood berm also resulted in approximately of petroleum being released into the river as many fuel containers were washed out. The fuel/oil containers were staged around the facility to supply fuel for pumps which remove water within the flood containment barriers. The rubber berm was a secondary measure not mandated by the NRC and was put in place by OPPD to provide additional room for work immediately outside the reactor buildings. According to the NRC, the water-filled berm \"protects several pieces of equipment that have been brought onsite, including an additional emergency diesel generator for supplying AC electrical power, water pumps, firefighting equipment and sandbagging supplies\". On July 11 OPPD installed a new inflatable berm as a replacement.\n\nAccording to OPPD, the plant is designed to withstand waters up to above mean sea level. The river was not expected to exceed . NRC officials were at the plant at the time and NRC statements said the plant remains safe. NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko confirmed the plant's safety when he visited the plant on June 27.\n\nOn June 30 one of the pumps used to remove seepage caught fire when a worker was refilling it with gasoline. The worker put the fire out with a fire extinguisher but was burned on his arms and face and he was airlifted via helicopter to Lincoln, Nebraska. OPPD said the fire was in an auxiliary security building area and not in the reactor area and that the plant was never in danger.\n\nBefore restarting OPPD spent $180 million recommissioning the plant, and cleared a list of 450 corrective items issued by the NRC. The utility company raised rates twice whilst the plant was down, 5.9 percent in 2012 and 6.9 percent in 2013, citing these costs among other things. The newer problems discovered in 2012 inspection were not included in the calculations.\nAfter three years in cold shutdown, the plant regained full power again on December 26, 2013.\n\nTwo weeks later on January 9, 2014, the plant had to stop producing power again after workers discovered a damaged sluice gate. In mid-March 2014, during maintenance work on the plant's generator, the turbine cooling system began losing water, prompting the automatic failsafe system to shut down the turbines, then the reactor, according to a report filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The shutdown was expected to be temporary.\n\nInspections of the plant in 2012 meant to determine damage from the 2011 flooding led to the discovery that there were \"problems inside the nuclear containment\" that were not related to the flood, but had been ongoing for decades, according to a presentation by the NRC and detailed in a public meeting held by the Omaha Public Power District. OPPD discovered that under extreme circumstances, some of the structural supports inside the building that houses the reactor weren't strong enough to support the building. Nuclear industry whistleblower Arnie Gundersen said that the plant was \"designed with hand calculations and slide rules in the 1960s\" and that the Fort Calhoun plant managers had known about the \"systemic\" problems for \"years if not decades\", but had not told the NRC. He discussed the report:\n\nDavid Lochbaum, director of the Nuclear Safety Project for Union of Concerned Scientists, said the structural problems should have been caught much earlier, and that if the NRC conducted 'more than just spot checks', it might have uncovered them in 2003.\n\nWallace Taylor, attorney on behalf of the Sierra Club, told the NRC that structural problems at the plant should have kept it from being licensed for operation: \n\nBesides problems with the math used in its design, the plant came under scrutiny for failing to replace the Teflon used originally, as directed by the NRC in 1985. In that year, experts revealed that Teflon tends to disintegrate in the presence of high radiation. The plant replaced the Teflon in some places, but left it in others, making Fort Calhoun the only nuclear power plant in the US to use Teflon.\n\nSubsequently, Teflon penetrations were replaced prior to the plant restart in 2014.\n\nOn June 16, 2016 the Omaha Public Power District board voted unanimously to shut down the Fort Calhoun Plant. This decision was based on financial interest to both OPPD and its customers. \"Once closed, a nuclear plant must undergo a decommissioning process to remove or decontaminate materials and equipment that have been exposed to radioactivity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires decommissioning to be completed within 60 years of a plant's closure.\"Nuclear decommissioning options considered include the Safstor method, or Decon method. The Safstor method involves placing the facility into safe storage for 40 to 60 years, and proceeding with the decontamination after that time. \"The Safstor decommissioning process — estimated at $1.2 billion through 2055 — would begin this year and be completed within 60 years.\" The Decon Method involves immediate dismantling of the site which would release the site for use in as few as 5 years.\n\nOn October 24, 2016 the plant was shut down.\n\n"}

{"id": "1806428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806428", "title": "FIBA Basketball World Cup", "text": "FIBA Basketball World Cup\n\nThe FIBA Basketball World Cup, also known as the FIBA World Cup of Basketball or simply the FIBA World Cup, between 1950 and 2010 known as the FIBA World Championship, is an international basketball competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's global governing body. It is considered the flagship event of FIBA.\n\nThe tournament structure is similar, but not identical, to that of the FIFA World Cup; both of these international competitions were played in the same year from 1970 through 2014. A parallel event for women's teams, now known as the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, is also held quadrennially. From 1986 through 2014, the men's and women's championships were held in the same year, though in different countries. The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the Naismith Trophy, first awarded in 1967. The current champions are Spain, who defeated Argentina in the final of the 2019 tournament.\n\nFollowing the 2014 FIBA championships for men and women, the men's World Cup was scheduled on a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup was held in 2019, in the year following the FIFA World Cup. The women's championship, which was renamed from \"FIBA World Championship for Women\" to \"FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup\", after its 2014 edition, will remain on the previous four-year cycle, with championships in the same year as the FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 FIBA World Championship, which was held in Canada, was the first FIBA World Cup tournament in which currently active US NBA players, that had also already played in an official NBA regular season game, were allowed to participate. All FIBA World Championship/World Cup tournaments since then, are thus considered as fully professional level tournaments.\n\nThe FIBA Basketball World Cup was conceived at a meeting of the FIBA World Congress at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Long-time FIBA Secretary-General Renato William Jones urged FIBA to adopt a World Championship, similar to the FIFA World Cup, to be held in every four years between Olympiads. The FIBA Congress, seeing how successful the 23-team Olympic tournament was that year, agreed to the proposal, beginning with a tournament in 1950. Argentina was selected as host, largely because it was the only country willing to take on the task. Argentina took advantage of the host selection, winning all their games en route to becoming the first FIBA World Champion.\n\nThe first five tournaments were held in South America, and teams from the Americas dominated the tournament, winning eight of nine medals at the first three tournaments. By 1963, however, teams from Eastern Europe (the Soviet Union) and Southeast Europe (Yugoslavia), in particular – began to catch up to the teams from the American continents. Between 1963 and 1990, the tournament was dominated by the United States, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil who together accounted for every medal at the tournament.\n\nThe 1994 FIBA World Championship held in Toronto marked the beginning of a new era, as currently active American NBA players participated in the tournament for the first time (prior to that only European and South American professionals were allowed to participate as they were still classified as amateurs), while the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia split into many new states. The United States dominated that year and won gold, while the former states of the USSR and Yugoslavia, Russia and Croatia, won silver and bronze. The 1998 FIBA World Championship, held in Greece (Athens and Piraeus), lost some of its luster when the 1998–99 NBA lockout prevented NBA players from participating. The new Yugoslavian team, now consisting of the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, won the gold medal over Russia, while the USA, with professional basketball players playing in Europe and two college players, finished third.\n\nIn 2002, other nations eventually caught up to the four powerhouse countries and their successor states. FR Yugoslavia, led by Peja Stojaković of the Sacramento Kings and Dejan Bodiroga of FC Barcelona won the final game against Argentina, while Dirk Nowitzki, who was the tournament's MVP, led Germany to the bronze, its first ever World Championship medal. Meanwhile, the United States team, this time made up of NBA players, struggled to a sixth-place finish. This new era of parity convinced FIBA to expand the tournament to 24 teams for the 2006, 2010, and 2014 editions of the tournament.\n\nIn 2006, emerging powerhouse Spain beat Greece in the first appearance in the final for both teams. Spain became only the seventh team (Yugoslavia and FR Yugoslavia are counted separately in the FIBA records) to capture a World Championship gold. The USA, who lost to Greece in a semi-final, won against Argentina in the third-place match and claimed bronze.\n\nIn the 2010 FIBA World Championship final, the USA defeated Turkey and won gold for the first time in 16 years, while Lithuania beat Serbia and won bronze. The United States became the third country to defend the championship, winning against Serbia at the 2014 edition of the tournament. France beat Lithuania in the bronze medal game.\n\nAfter the 2014 edition, FIBA instituted significant changes to the World Cup. The final competition was expanded from 24 to 32 teams. Also, for the first time since 1967, the competition would no longer overlap with the FIFA World Cup. To accommodate this change, the 2014 FIBA World Cup will be followed by a 2019 edition in China, then followed by a 2023 edition in the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia.\n\nThe Basketball World Cup has used various forms of qualification throughfive tournaments were held in South America and participation was dominated by teams from the Americas. At the first tournament, FIBA intended for the three Olympic medalists to compete, plus the host Argentina and two teams each from Europe, Asia, and South America. However, no Asian team was willing to travel to the event, so six of the ten teams were from the Americas (all three Olympic medalists were from the Americas, plus the zone received two continental berths and an Asia's berth). The former European powerhouse Soviet Union, later made their first tournament appearance in 1959, after missing the first two events.\n\nIn the tournament's early years, only Europe and South America had established continental tournaments, so participation in the tournament was largely by invitation. Later, Asia added a continental championship in 1960, followed by Africa in 1962, Central America in 1965, and Oceania in 1971, As a result of these changes, qualification became more formalized starting with the 1967 tournament. In that year, the Asian champion received an automatic berth in the tournament, joining the top European and South American teams. In 1970, the African and Oceanian champion each received a berth, while the Centrobasket champion and runner-up were each invited. For most of these years, the tournament host, defending World Champion, and top Olympic basketball tournament finishers also qualified for the event.\n\nFrom 1970 through the 2014 World Cup, qualification continued to be based on the continental competitions and the Olympic tournament. The only major change came in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, when the tournament started taking qualifiers from the newly redesigned FIBA Americas Championship rather than from North, Central, and South America individually. After the tournament expanded to 24 teams in 2006, the tournament allocated qualification as follows:\n\n\nEach of the five continental championships also served as qualification for the Olympics, so all were held every two years. The year immediately preceding the World Championship was used to determine the berths at the tournament. For example, all of the berths at the 2010 FIBA World Championship were determined by continental championships held in 2009. After the first 20 teams qualified, FIBA then selected four wild card teams, based on sporting, economic, and governance criteria, as well as a required registration fee from each team to be considered by the FIBA board. Of the four wild cards, only three could come from one continental zone. In each of the two tournaments that the wild card system was in place, FIBA selected the maximum three European teams to compete in the event.\n\nFIBA instituted major changes to its competition calendar and the qualifying process for both the World Cup and Olympics in 2017.\n\nFirst, the continental championships are now held once every four years, specifically in years that immediately follow the Summer Olympics. The continental championships no longer play a role in qualifying for either the World Cup or Olympics.\n\nThe 2019 World Cup qualifying process, which began in 2017, is the first under a new format. Qualifying takes place over a two-year cycle, involving six windows of play. Qualifying zones mirror the FIBA continental zones, except that FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania are now combined into a single Asia-Pacific qualifying zone. In each qualifying zone, nations are divided into Division A and Division B, with promotion and relegation between the two. FIBA did not initially reveal full details of the new process, but announced that at least in opening phases, it would feature groups of three or four teams, playing home-and-away within the group. Below is the list of distribution of berths according to each FIBA qualifying zone.\n\n\nThe Basketball World Cup has existed in several different formats throughout the years, as it has expanded and contracted between 10 and 24 teams. The first tournament, in 1950, began with a ten-team double-elimination tournament, followed by a six-team round robin round to determine the champion. Between 1954 and 1974, each tournament started with a group stage preliminary round; the top teams in each preliminary round group then moved on to a final round robin group to determine the champion. In 1978, FIBA added a gold medal game between the top two finishers in the final group and a bronze medal game between the third and fourth place teams. In each year between 1959 and 1982, the host team received a bye into the final group. Of the seven host teams in this era, only three won medals, despite the head start. As a result, FIBA made the host team compete in the preliminary round starting in 1986.\n\nIn 1986, the tournament briefly expanded to 24 teams. Four groups of six teams each competed in the preliminary round group stage. The top three teams in each group then competed in the second group stage, followed by a four-team knockout tournament between the top two finishers in each group. The championship contracted back down to 16 teams for the 1990 tournament. The three tournaments between 1990 and 1998, each had two group stages followed by a four-team knockout tournament to determine the medalists. The 2002 tournament expanded the knockout round to eight teams.\n\nIn 2006, FIBA made the decision to expand back to 24 teams and introduced the format that was in place through 2014. Under that format, the teams were divided into four preliminary round groups of six teams each.\n\nIn 2019, the final tournament will expand to 32 teams.\nIf the teams should be tied at the end of the preliminary round, the ties are broken by the following criteria in order:\nThe top two teams in each group then advance to a sixteen-team single-elimination knockout round. It begins with the eighth finals, where the top teams in each group play the fourth-placed teams in another group and the second and third-placed teams in each group face off. This is followed by the quarterfinals, semi-finals, and final. The semi-final losers play in the bronze medal game, while the quarterfinal losers play in a consolation bracket to determine fifth through eighth places.\n\nSince 1967, the champion of each tournament has been awarded the Naismith Trophy, named in honor of basketball's inventor, James Naismith. A trophy had been planned since the first World Championship in 1950, but did not come to fruition until FIBA finally commissioned a trophy in 1965, after receiving a US$1,000 donation. The original trophy was used from 1967 through 1994. An updated trophy was introduced for the 1998 FIBA World Championship and the original now sits at the Pedro Ferrándiz Foundation in Spain.\n\nThe second trophy is designed in an Egyptian-inspired lotus shape, upon which there are carved maps of the continents and precious stones symbolizing the five continents (FIBA Americas represents both North America and South America). Dr. Naismith's name is engraved on all four sides in Latin, Arabic, Chinese, and Egyptian hieroglyphs. The trophy stands 47 centimeters (18.5 inches) tall and weighs nine kilograms (twenty pounds).\n\nThe most recent Naismith Trophy design was revealed in the 2019 FIBA World Cup Qualifiers Draw Ceremonies, last 7 May 2017. The trophy, which stands about 60 centimeters high (13 cm. higher than the 1998 version), is made almost entirely out of gold, and features the names of the previous world cup champions at the base. FIBA's original name (Federation Internationale de Basketball Amateur) is also engraved at the trophy's \"hoop\". The trophy was designed by Radiant, and handcrafted by the silversmith Thomas Lyte.\n\n(OT): game decided after overtime.\n\nIn the most current medal table released by FIBA as seen on the FIBA archive website, the 2014 championship is taken into account, and the records of SFR Yugoslavia and FR Yugoslavia are combined under \"Yugoslavia\".\n\nPreviously, FIBA had a medal table from 1950 to 2006, and another medal table that included results from 1950 to 2006, that separated the results of SFR Yugoslavia/FR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro respectively into \"Yugoslavia\" or \"Serbia and Montenegro\". The ranking of teams between the latter two medal tables are different, with the FIBA.com ranking by number of total medals, while the FIBA World Cup website's ranking is by number of gold medals. The number of medals won by the United States differs between the latter two medal tables, despite encompassing the same period. The latter two medal tables also do not include the results of the 2010 and 2014 championships.\n\nFinally, a FIBA.com PDF linked from the FIBA.com history section that documents the championships from 1950 to 2002 also has a medal table that included tournaments from 1950 to 1998, which also separated pre-breakup Yugoslavia, called as \"Yusgoslavia\" from the post-breakup Yugoslavia, called as \"Serbia and Montenegro\", and ranked the teams by the number of total medals.\n\nThe FIBA archive also lists the achievements of each national team, separating it per IOC codes. The national team representing Serbia's first international tournament is listed as 2007, Serbia and Montenegro's tournament participation lasted from 2003 to 2006, and Yugoslavia's participation was from 1947 to 2002. Chinese Taipei was listed not to have participated in the World Cup, indeed its first participation in any FIBA tournament started in 1986; a team called \"Taiwan\" participated from 1960 to 1973, and a \"Formosa\" team joined from 1954 to 1959.\n\nBelow is the FIBA table as seen from the FIBA archive website, updated with results since 1998. The records of SFR Yugoslavia and FR Yugoslavia (counted together as \"Yugoslavia\") are separated from records of Serbia and Serbia and Montenegro. In the case of the Soviet Union, their records also didn't carry over to Russia.\n\nBoldface denotes active basketball players and highest medal count among all players (including these who not included in these tables) per type.\n\nThe table shows those who have won at least 2 gold medals at the World Cups.\n\nThe table shows those who have won at least 4 medals in total at the World Cups.\n\nEleven players – Ubiratan Pereira Maciel, Marcel De Souza, Marcelinho Machado, Anderson Varejao, Leandrinho Barbosa and Alex Garcia of Brazil, Phil Smyth of Australia, Daniel Santiago and Jerome Mincy of Puerto Rico, Eduardo Mingas of Angola and Luis Scola of Argentina – have appeared in five tournaments.\n\nBrazilian legend Oscar Schmidt is the runaway all-time leading scorer, scoring 906 career points in four tournaments, between 1978 and 1990. Nikos Galis of Greece, is the all-time leading scorer for a single tournament, averaging 33.7 points per game for the Greeks at the 1986 FIBA World Championship.\n\nSerbian coach and former player Željko Obradović is the only person who won the title, both as a coach and a player. He was a member of the Yugoslavia team that won the 1990 FIBA World Championship and coached the Yugoslavia team that won the 1998 FIBA World Championship.\n\nFIBA names a Most Valuable Player for each tournament. Since the tournament opened to NBA players at the 1994 tournament for the first time, NBA players have won six of the seven MVP trophies awarded – Shaquille O'Neal for the United States in 1994, Germany's Dirk Nowitzki at the 2002 tournament, Spain's Pau Gasol at the 2006 tournament, Kevin Durant for the United States at the 2010 tournament, Kyrie Irving for the United States at the 2014 tournament and Spain's Ricky Rubio at the 2019 tournament. The only exception was Dejan Bodiroga of FR Yugoslavia, who was the MVP of the 1998 tournament, when the NBA players were not able to participate, due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout.\n\nThe 2010 FIBA World Championship reached a global TV audience of 800 million people, across 171 countries, with the official website having 30 million views during the tournament. Both numbers broke the previous records set at the 2006 FIBA World Championship and at the EuroBasket 2009. Three of the games involving Lithuania were among the highest rated programs in that country. In China, 65 million watched the Chinese national team's game against Greece, in the preliminary round. This was an improvement from the 2006 FIBA World Championship, which was held in Japan, and was shown in 150 countries. This meant that games aired in the morning in Europe and at night in the Americas; despite this, audiences broke records, with Italy's game against Slovenia achieving a 20% viewing share in Italy, Serbia's game against Nigeria netting a 33% share in Serbia, and a 600,000-audience in the United States for the US national team's game against Puerto Rico at 1 am.\n\nBefore the 2010 FIBA World Championship started in Turkey, FIBA had already sold 350,000 tickets, for a revenue of between US$8 to 10 million. The number of tickets sold was 10% higher than 2006, although the revenue was less than 2006's US$18 million, which was widely attributed to the strong Japanese yen. Meanwhile, FIBA got two-thirds of marketing rights revenue, of which one-third, or about US$8 million, went to the local organizers. FIBA had also successfully negotiated TV rights deals, which all went to FIBA, worth US$25 million, including a TV rights deal with ESPN. In 2006, the Japanese organizers were targeting to sell 180,000 tickets, mostly to a Japanese audience; as for the overseas audience, the Japanese organizers didn't \"expect them in great numbers\". This was seen as a big improvement from the 2002 tournament, which was a financial loss for USA Basketball and Indianapolis, in which all games were held in one city. This led to the Japanese organizers to hold games throughout the country, instead of just in a single city.\n\nAt the most recent world championship, which was re-branded as the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, in Spain, FIBA reported impressive ratings from nations which were participating in the tournament during the first week of the group phase. Most games involving European teams had a market share of at least 20%, including a 40% market share in Finland, for the Finnish national team's game against the Dominican Republic. The TV ratings in the United States beat out the 2014 US Tennis Open, but some US sports media still described viewers in the US as not caring about the FIBA Basketball World Cup. In the Philippines, the entire tournament had an average reach of 67.8%.\n\n\n"}

In 1848 he joined the staff of the Springfield Republican newspaper, where he invented a device to fold papers. He graduated from the Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1851, where he worked with Louis Agassiz. Also in 1851, he was appointed assistant professor at the Lawrence Scientific School, and was lecturer on chemistry and physics at Groton Academy. He edited \"The Annual of Scientific Discovery\" from 1850 to 1866. He invented devices for textile mills, and wrote \"The Science of Common Things\" (1857) and \"Wells's Principles and Applications of Chemistry\" (1858); \"Wells's First Principles of Geology\" (1861) and \"Wells's Natural Philosophy\" (1863), which went through fifteen editions as a college textbook.\n\nHe was a strong supporter of Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, writing pamphlets that reassured investors of the soundness of Lincoln's financial policies. He first attained reputation as a political economist by an address on “Our Burden and Our Strength,” read before a literary society of Troy in 1864. It discussed the resources of the United States in regard to the nation's debt-paying ability, and attracted the attention of President Lincoln, who appointed him in 1865 chairman of a three-member National Revenue Commission. In this capacity Wells was the first to collect economic and financial statistics for government use. The Commission's recommendations became law in 1866.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson made him a special commissioner of the revenue. The \"Reports of the Special Commissioner of the Revenue, 1866-69\" recommended the use of stamps in the collection of revenue on liquor and tobacco. Wells was instrumental in abolishing the many petty taxes which had been imposed during the Civil War, and originated most of the important forms and methods of internal revenue taxation adopted from 1866 to 1870.\n\nIn 1867, Wells studies the costs of production in Europe. He started as a high-tariff supporter, but finding that high wages in America made for efficiency as compared with the backward methods of competing countries, he was converted to free trade, and became a leading advocate of abolition of the tariff. He was an advisor to his close friend, Congressman James Garfield, on tariff matters, and later to Grover Cleveland. \nAs chairman of the New York state tax commission, his \"Local Taxation\" (1871) was a highly influential analysis. The problem was New York was losing business to neighboring states with lower taxes. He was an active consultant to the railroad industry.\n\nHe served as delegate to the Democratic National Conventions, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress from Connecticut in 1876 and 1890, and he made many speeches in each of Cleveland's campaigns.\n\nWells died at Norwich, Connecticut, which had been his residence since 1870. He was married, May 9, 1860, to Mary Sanford Dwight, by whom he had one son; a second wife and a son survived him.\n\nWells wrote extensively on current economic issues, especially on tariffs, the theory of money and the currency question, and taxation. His goal was greater efficiency by progressive lowering of costs of production through the application of science. He was the foremost American authority on the economics of the emerging \"the machine age.\" He argued that industrial depressions, with falling prices, were due not to insufficient supply of money, but to sudden and rapid increase in commodities. He strongly opposed inflationary monetary policies such as free silver, writing \"Robinson Crusoe's Money\" (1876; reissued 1896). Wells early emphasized that technological unemployment was displacing of men by machines. He urged the substitution of trained personnel for political hangers-on in tax bodies, sought to bring system into taxation, and was the inveterate foe of the general property tax as applied to intangibles. He fought against income taxes, especially in 1894. \nHis writing style was characterized by simplicity, candor, and an extraordinary success in presenting statistics in a day when educated people did not understand percentages. He wrote \" The Relation of the Government to the Telegraph\" (1873); \"The Cremation Theory of Specie Resumption\" (1875); \"The Silver Question\" (1877); \"Why We Trade and How We Trade\" (1878); \"Our Merchant Marine\" (1882); \"A Primer of Tariff Reform\" (1884); \"Practical Economics\" (1885); \"Recent Economic Changes\" (1889), a major description and analysis of the national economy; \"Breakers Ahead: Cause of the Present Crisis\" (1896); and \"The Theory and Practice of Taxation\" (1900).\n\n\"Recent Economic Changes and Their Effect on the Production and Distribution of Wealth and Well-Being of Society\" (1891) is a frequently cited reference for U.S. economic history of the late 19th century and is available in modern reprints. It is an account of the dramatic changes in the world economy transitioning into the Second Industrial Revolution in which Wells documented many of the changes in trade, such as triple expansion steam shipping, railroads, the effect of the international telegraph network and the opening of the Suez Canal. Wells also discussed the Long Depression and many causes of the great advances in productivity of the preceding 20 years. Wells noted that many of the government inquires on the “depression of prices” (deflation) found various reasons such as the scarcity of gold and silver. Wells showed that the U.S money supply, especially the amount of gold and silver, actually rose significantly during the deflation. Wells pointed out that deflation only lowered the cost of goods that benefited from improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by craftsmen did not decrease in value, nor did many services, and the cost of labor actually increased. Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did not have modern manufacturing, transportation and communications.\n\n\"Recent Economic Changes\" gives support to those who argue that economic growth in the late 19th century is significantly underestimated.\n\n\n"}

He served as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate from the 1st Senatorial District from 1922 to 1923. He won election to the United States Senate for Pennsylvania in 1926 but was never seated and was eventually removed in 1929 due to allegations of corruption and voter fraud.\n\nHe was a notorious political boss in the Philadelphia Republican machine of the early 20th century. Vare and his two brothers, Edwin and George, were known as the \"Dukes of South Philadelphia\" and held political control over South Philadelphia ward leadership and patronage jobs for decades. The contracting business he owned along with his brothers was involved in the construction of well-known sites in Philadelphia such as Municipal Stadium, the Broad Street subway and the Philadelphia Art Museum.\n\nVare was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Augustus and Abigail Vare. He was the youngest of three brothers, all of whom were contractors and politicians. George (1859–1908), Edwin (1862–1922) and William were known as the \"Dukes of South Philadelphia\" and controlled ward leadership and patronage jobs for decades.\n\nHe grew up on a pig and produce farm in Philadelphia at the current location of Fourth Street and Snyder Avenue.\n\nJohn Wanamaker, the Department Store magnate took young Bill under his wing and paid for his tuition at Central High School in Philadelphia. Later, he worked as a storeboy at Wanamaker's.\n\nAt age 15, Vare entered the mercantile business and became a general contractor in 1893.\n\nHis political career began in 1884 when he observed the Mummers parade on New Year's Day and realized that such marches could be employed in political campaigns. The Vare brothers started a family business hauling ash and garbage in South Philadelphia. In 1890 he started construction contracting with his two older brothers. Vare Brothers contracting worked on excavating, paving and municipal contracts for the city of Philadelphia that totaled $7 million between 1909 and 1912. Their projects included building trolley tracks, sewers, the Municipal Stadium, the Broad Street subway and excavating the site of the Philadelphia Art Museum.\n\nVare was elected to Philadelphia City Council in 1898 and served until 1901. He served as Recorder of Deeds for Philadelphia from 1902 to 1912. In 1911, he ran for mayor as a moderate Republican. The primary was won by George Earle, Jr., but it split the Republican organization in Philadelphia three different ways, and it was these splits that accounted for Independent Rudolph Blankenburg's election in 1911.\n\nIn 1912, Vare was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate and at the same time was elected to the U.S. Congress for the Pennsylvania 1st congressional district seat left vacant by the death of Henry H. Bingham.\n\nIn November 1922, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Senate in a special election to fill the first district seat left vacant by his brother Edwin's death. Vare resigned the seat a year later. His sister-in-law Flora, won the ensuing special election, becoming the first woman to serve in the chamber.\n\nIn 1912, Vare was elected to the first of seven terms in the House of Representatives. While in the House, his voting record took a much more pronounced turn to the left. He supported the abolition of child labor, the federal income tax, the rights of unions to bargain collectively, and voting rights for women and the ending of segregation on passenger rail cars. In 1921 Vare's rival, Senator Boies Penrose, died. The following year his older brother Ed also died. This left Bill Vare as the undisputed political leader of Philadelphia, with broad influence over the burgeoning industrial and economic region of the middle Atlantic seaboard.\n\nVare's voting record in the United States House of Representatives was classically Pennsylvania Republican, or more liberal on social issues and then more conservative on issues of pure business. Vare repeatedly pursued the repeal of Prohibition because of the cruel police state it imposed, and was actually able to show, statistically, that alcohol-related crimes increased threefold in Philadelphia during the first years of Prohibition. It was a testament to his moral character that he argued this way, as it has been inferred that the Philadelphia Republican Party machine relied on alcohol-related revenues to fund its core activities, and Vare thus stood to lose much of his financial backing by pursuing Prohibition's repeal.\n\nThe Republican organization in Philadelphia received many offers to do business from the likes of Waxey Gordon and \"Lucky\" Luciano. But this was no ordinary arrangement, as Vare forced both Gordon and Luciano to agree that Vare would hold a veto power over any racket operating in Philadelphia. In a further bid to gird the fiscal foundation of the Party, Vare decided to extract \"loyalty oaths\" from the entire Philadelphia Republican organization. Vare was also able to exert tremendous influence over Philadelphia's legal business. This was a strong form of politics, because Vare had lots of influence with the unions.\n\nVare used his political power to relocate the Sesquicentennial Exposition from Center City, Philadelphia to South Philadelphia and provide his constituents with millions of dollars worth of jobs and infrastructure investment.\n\nIn 1926 Vare announced his candidacy for the United States Senate. Both the primaries and general election were mired in scandal. After Vare apparently won the election against William B. Wilson, Governor Gifford Pinchot, who had been beaten by Vare in the primary, refused to certify the election. In January 1927, Pinchot testified before the Senate, producing several thousand illegal paper ballots. Wilson alleged that voter fraud in the election included padded registration lists, phantom voters and voter intimidation. In August 1928, Vare was partially paralyzed by a stroke brought on by the stress of the Senate investigation.\n\nIn December 1929, the Senate voted fifty-eight to twenty-two to deny the senate seat to Vare. While agreeing that he had won the seat, the reason given for denying him the seat was that he had spent excessively to win the nomination. Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher appointed Joseph Grundy to the senate seat. However, Vare took it to mean that he was being denied the seat because of Pinchot's charges. As a result, in the 1930 gubernatorial primary, Vare supported Democratic nominee John Hemphill, who lost to Pinchot. At this point a palace coup emerged at the Republican City Committee, where he was ousted and replaced by Secretary of Labor James Davis.\n\nVare was unable to handle the rigors of campaigning due to his declining health but was still wielded political power and supported the candidacy of Francis Shunk Brown for Governor and James J. Davis for U.S. Senate.\n\nFour years later, Vare attempted a comeback as a Democrat. However, the symptoms of the 1928 stroke had become worse in the ensuing six years, and he died on the sixth anniversary of the stroke. He is interred in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nVare was married to Ida Morris.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also Hancock's seventeenth album overall.\n\nThe album clearly followed from its predecessor \"Man-Child\". As ever, Paul Jackson's basslines were critical, and the other regular member Bennie Maupin continued to provide most of the solos alongside Hancock. \"Man-Child\" had seen the addition of electric guitar to Hancock's sound, and \"Secrets\" saw the guitar's place in the arrangements rise to crucial importance throughout. The flamboyant rhythm guitar contributions of top Motown session musician Wah Wah Watson are a particularly notable feature of the album.\n\nWhere \"Man-Child\" was evenly divided between up-tempo and laid-back tracks, \"Secrets\" emphasized the more mellow, softly rounded mood. Even the more up-tempo tracks, \"Doin' It\" and \"Cantelope Island\", are suffused with a relaxed Caribbean influence, and overall the album tends towards restrained, rolling grooves rather than overtly high-energy funk. Appropriately, Hancock spent much of his time using the mellow tones of the Rhodes piano, and took advantage of the new polyphonic synthesizers to contribute thick pads, foreshadowing ambient music.\n\nAlthough summery and mellow, the album was far from lounge music, with some extremely abstract and intense sections, particular in the latter half; it is also entirely instrumental beside the \"Jus' keep on doin' it\" chants of the opening track. Subsequent Hancock albums saw the addition of more vocoded lead vocals and disco influences.\n\nThe \"Secrets\" line-up performed \"Spider\" (from this LP) and \"Hang Up Your Hang-Ups\" (from \"Man-Child\") at the V.S.O.P. concert in the summer of 1976.\n\n\n"}

The station has one sixth generation General Electric boiling water reactor that has a nominal gross electric output of about 1010 MW. Commercial operation began on June 16, 1986.\n\nRiver Bend is operated by Entergy, which owns 100% of the station through its subsidiary, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.\n\nThe Site Vice President is Bill Maguire, the General Manager of Plant Operations is Steve Vercelli, and the Senior Operations Manager is Timothy Venable.\n\nRiver Bend supplies the residents of Louisiana with approximately 30% of their electricity. The station also provides residents with over 600 full-time jobs and has improved living conditions in the surrounding area with high achieving academic schools with generous donations made to the local areas. The station has been recognized as a high achieving site by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, INPO, and WANO. River Bend has some of the highest performing employees in the industry in all departments. Behind the day-to-day operation of the station is a highly achieved Operations department. While all departments are important to the safe operation of the station, the operators are the ones who day in and day out monitor and control the plant in a safe manner to make safe and reliable electricity for the citizens of Louisiana. These operators are generally hired in as non licensed field operators who perform work outside of the control room. After years of successful employment as a non licensed operator, the most qualified and best performing individuals are selected to attend training to become a licensed reactor operator. This two-year program is extremely challenging and involves rigorous studying and simulator training to make it through NRC generic fundamentals all the way through to the NRC license exam. Many have attempted to gain a license but it is not for everyone and some do not make it. For the ones who do make it, they proudly hold their license issued by the NRC and are in elite company as they are the most highly trained employees of the plant and are responsible for every action taken at the plant to ensure safe and reliable operation. Once licensed, the operator must maintain satisfactory standing with their license by successfully completing a written and performance evaluation every five weeks along with an annual written exam and job evaluation.\nThe River Bend site was originally designed to have two identical units. Construction on Unit 1 began in 1973, but Unit 2 barely broke ground, with only the containment base mat and some underground piping installed. In 1984, plans to construct Unit 2 were officially abandoned.\n\nOn September 25, 2008, Entergy filed a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for Unit 3, a new nuclear reactor at River Bend. The 1550 MW Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) was the selected design.The reactor's cost was estimated at $6.2 billion.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, Entergy indefinitely postponed work towards the license and construction of Unit 3.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of River Bend was 23,466, an increase of 11.1 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 951,103, an increase of 11.2 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Baton Rouge (25 miles to city center).\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at River Bend was 1 in 40,000, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nUnlike the Waterford Nuclear Generating Station downriver in Hahnville, River Bend continued operation throughout Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nThe plant was shut down during Hurricane Gustav in 2008.\n\n\n"}

The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place, Sloppy Joe’s, and the name stuck.\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades. Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe’s today titled \"Hemingway and Friends\".\n\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town. Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\nJoe Russell was a Conch, born and raised in Key West. Conch is the name given to Key West natives—a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters. Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of “To Have and Have Not,” letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed. One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old. At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father’s death. He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\nSloppy Joe’s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays). Sloppy Joe’s has four complimentary divisions: bar, food, entertainment, and the Retail Store. The bar offers live music on stage every day Noon to 2:00am and dancing. The performers offer a wide range of music styles and comical entertainment.\n\nJust as in Joe Russell's day, hospitable Bartenders welcome patrons at virtually all hours of the day and night.\nThe main Bar structure was built in 1917; and the second building, which houses the Kitchen and Joe’s Tap Room, was built in 1892.\n\nJoe’s Tap Room is attached to Sloppy Joe’s. Open daily at Noon, Joe’s Tap Room has the same food menu as Sloppy Joe’s and offers variety of crafted beers on tap.\n\nThe bar is the site of the annual Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike contest, started in 1981.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\nSloppy Joe's also has a location in Treasure Island, Florida and a third location in Daytona Beach, Florida opened in February 2010.\n\nThe bar is also referenced to in the famous film \"Citizen Kane\", as the reporter Thompson interviews Kane's old friend and dramatic critic:\n\n"}
