Since the majority of plastic is non-biodegradable, recycling is a part of global efforts to reduce plastic in the waste stream, especially the approximately 8 million metric tonnes of waste plastic that enters the Earth's ocean every year.\n\nCompared with lucrative recycling of metal, and similar to the low value of glass recycling, plastic polymers recycling is often more challenging because of low density and low value. There are also numerous technical hurdles to overcome when recycling plastic. Materials recovery facilities are responsible for sorting and processing plastics. As of 2019, due to limitations in their economic viability, these facilities have struggled to make a meaningful contribution to the plastic supply chain.\n\nWhen different types of plastics are melted together, they tend to phase-separate, like oil and water, and set in these layers. The phase boundaries cause structural weakness in the resulting material, meaning that polymer blends are useful in only limited applications. The two most widely manufactured plastics, polypropylene and polyethylene, behave this way, which limits their utility for recycling. Each time plastic is recycled, additional virgin materials must be added to help improve the integrity of the material. So, even recycled plastic has new plastic material added in. The same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2–3 times before its quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.\n\nRecently, the use of block copolymers as \"molecular stitches\" or \"macromolecular welding flux\" has been proposed to overcome the difficulties associated with phase separation during recycling. Certain bioplastics, such as PLA, recycled by breaking down plastic polymers into their chemical building blocks, can be recycled hundreds of times.\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics or plastics which can be organically recycled or can be composted in industrial composting is increasing for certain short-lived packaging applications.\n\nThe percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste, can be increased when manufacturers of packaged goods minimize mixing of packaging materials and eliminate contaminants. The Association of Plastics Recyclers has issued a \"Design Guide for Recyclability\".\n\nBroadly, there are two major ways to recycle plastic: (1) mechanical recycling (\"chop and wash\"), where the plastic is washed, ground into powders and melted, and (2) chemical recycling, where the plastic is broken down into basic components.\n\nBefore recycling, most plastics are sorted according to their resin type. In the past, plastic reclaimers used the resin identification code (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which was developed by the Society of the Plastics Industry in 1988. Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1. Most plastic reclaimers do not rely on the RIC now; they use various sorting systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, sieving, separation by rates of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc. Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled.\n\nAfter sorting, for mechanical recycling the plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products. The highest quality purification may be referred to as \"regeneration\".\n\nScientists have estimated that the potential commodity value of waste plastic may be in excess of $300 per ton when used in process pathways yielding high-value chemical products or to produce electricity in efficient IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) processes.\n\nPlastic pyrolysis can convert petroleum-based waste streams such as plastics into fuels and carbons.\n\nGiven below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for pyrolysis:\n\nHeat compression takes all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard industrial waste, and mixes the load in tumblers (large rotating drums resembling giant clothes dryers). The most obvious benefit to this method is that all plastic is recyclable, not just matching forms. However, criticism rises from the energy costs of rotating the drums, and heating the post-melt pipes.\n\nDistributed recycling of plastics using additive manufacturing (or DRAM) can include mechanical grinding to make granules for 1) fused granular fabrication, 2) heated syringe printing, 3) 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and 4) filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. For some waste plastics, technical devices called recyclebots enable a form of distributed recycling by making 3-D printing filament. Preliminary life-cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of HDPE to make filament of 3D printers in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.\n\nFor some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again.\n\nAn estimated 60 companies are pursuing chemical recycling as of 2019.\n\nIn 2019, Eastman Chemical Company announced initiatives for methanolysis of polyesters and polymer gasification to syngas designed to handle a greater variety of used material.\n\nIn 2019, Brightmark Energy in the United States began building a facility to convert 100,000 tons of mixed plastic per into diesel, naphtha blend stocks, and wax; the company plans to expand into building another plant which can process an additional 800,000 tons of plastic per year. The company has said that the economics have a significant margin of safety from price declines.\n\nA process has also been developed in which many kinds of plastic can be used as a carbon source (in place of coke) in the recycling of scrap steel. There are also possibilities for better recycling of mixed plastics, avoiding the need for expensive/inefficient separation of the plastic waste stream. One such method is called compatibilization which uses special chemical bridging agents called compatibilizers to maintain the quality of mixed polymers.\n\nPost-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) containers are sorted into different color fractions and baled for onward sale. PET recyclers further sort the baled bottles and they are washed and flaked (or flaked and then washed). Non-PET fractions such as caps and labels are removed during this process. The clean flake is dried. Further treatment can take place e.g. melt filtering and pelletizing or various treatments to produce food-contact-approved recycled PET (RPET). This sorted post-consumer PET waste is crushed, chopped into flakes, pressed into bales, and offered for sale.\n\nOne use for this recycled PET is to create fabrics to be used in the clothing industry. The fabrics are created by spinning the PET flakes into thread and yarn. This is done just as easily as creating polyester from brand new PET. The recycled PET thread or yarn can be used either alone or together with other fibers to create a very wide variety of fabrics. Traditionally these fabrics are used to create strong, durable, rough products, such as jackets, coats, shoes, bags, hats, and accessories since they are usually too rough for direct skin contact and can cause irritation. However, these types of fabrics have become more popular as a result of the public's growing awareness of environmental issues. Numerous fabric and clothing manufacturers have capitalized on this trend.\n\nOther major outlets for RPET are new containers (food-contact or non-food-contact) produced either by (injection stretch blow) moulding into bottles and jars or by thermoforming APET sheet to produce clamshells, blister packs and collation trays. These applications used 46% of all RPET produced in Europe in 2010. Other applications, such as strapping tape, injection-moulded engineering components and building materials, account for 13% of the 2010 RPET production.\n\nIn the United States, the recycling rate for PET packaging was 31% in 2013, according to a report from The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) and The Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR). A total of 1.798 billion pounds was collected and 475 million pounds of recycled PET used out of a total of 5.764 billion pounds of PET bottles.\n\nPlastic #2, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is a commonly recycled plastic. HDPE's highly crystalline structure makes it a strong, high density, moderately stiff plastic. HDPE Thermoplastic materials become liquid at their melting point—around 130 °C. A major benefit of thermoplastics is that they can be heated to melting point, cooled, and reheated again without significant degradation. Instead of burning, thermoplastics like PE (Polyethylene) liquefy, allowing them to be easily extruded or injection molded and turned into brand new HDPE pipe. Often it is typically downcycled into plastic lumber, tables, roadside curbs, benches, truck cargo liners, trash receptacles, stationery (e.g. rulers) and other durable plastic products and is usually in demand.\n\nMost polystyrene products are not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. As a result, manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) scrap can easily be added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.\n\nRecycled EPS is also used in many metal casting operations. Rastra is made from EPS that is combined with cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete foundations and walls. Since 1993, American manufacturers have produced insulating concrete forms made with approximately 80% recycled EPS.\n\nThe white plastic polystyrene foam peanuts used as packing material are often accepted by shipping stores for reuse.\n\nSuccessful trials in Israel have shown that plastic films recovered from mixed municipal waste streams can be recycled into useful household products such as buckets.\n\nSimilarly, agricultural plastics such as mulch film, drip tape and silage bags are being diverted from the waste stream and successfully recycled into much larger products for industrial applications such as plastic composite railroad ties. Historically, these agricultural plastics have primarily been either landfilled or burned on-site in the fields of individual farms.\n\nCNN reports that Dr. S. Madhu of the Kerala Highway Research Institute, India, has formulated a road surface that includes recycled plastic: aggregate, bitumen (asphalt) with plastic that has been shredded and melted at a temperature below 220 °C (428 °F) to avoid pollution. This road surface is claimed to be very durable and monsoon rain resistant. The plastic is sorted by hand, which is economical in India. The test road used 60 kg of plastic for an approximately 500-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, two-lane road. The process chops thin-film road-waste into a light fluff of tiny flakes that hot-mix plants can uniformly introduce into viscous bitumen with a customized dosing machine. Tests at both Bangalore and the Indian Road Research Centre indicate that roads built using this 'KK process' will have longer useful lives and better resistance to cold, heat, cracking, and rutting, by a factor of 3.\n\nSome new innovations propose plastics much easier recycled, like 2019 polydiketoenamines. (PDK)\n\nMajor plastic recycling equipment companies include Tomra. Equipment such as shredders and granulators may be sold by a variety of companies.\n\nIn 2016, startup Precious Plastic created a marketplace called Bazar for selling machines and products targeted to DIY designers to recycle plastic.\n\nThe quantity of post-consumer plastics recycled has increased every year since at least 1990, but rates lag far behind those of other items, such as newspaper (about 80%) and corrugated fiberboard (about 70%). Overall, U.S. post-consumer plastic waste for 2008 was estimated at 33.6 million tons; 2.2 million tons (6.5%) were recycled and 2.6 million tons (8%) were burned for energy; 28.9 million tons, or 86%, were discarded in landfills.\n\nAs of 2015, approximately 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. In 2016 only 14% of plastic waste was recycled globally. According to the EPA, the recycling rate for plastics overall was 9.1% in 2015. Certain products have higher rates, such as PET bottles and jars at 29.9%, and HDPE natural bottles at 30.3%. These rates are lower than certain other materials, like steel cans, that had an estimated recycling rate of 71.3% in 2015.\n\nJapan's plastic waste utilization rate stood at 39% in 1996, increasing to 73% in 2006, 77% in 2011, 83% in 2014 and 86% in 2017, according to the nation's Plastic Waste Management Institute.\n\nIn 2008, the price of PET dropped from $370/ton in the US to $20 in November. PET prices had returned to their long-term averages by May 2009.\n\nSeven groups of plastic polymers, each with specific properties, are used worldwide for packaging applications (see table below). Each group of plastic polymer can be identified by its plastic identification code (PIC), usually a number or a letter abbreviation. For instance, low-density polyethylene can be identified by the number \"4\" or the letters \"LDPE\". The PIC appears inside a three-chasing-arrow recycling symbol. The symbol is used to indicate whether the plastic can be recycled into new products.\n\nThe PIC was introduced by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc., to provide a uniform system for the identification of various polymer types and to help recycling companies separate various plastics for reprocessing. Manufacturers of plastic products are required to use PIC labels in some countries/regions and can voluntarily mark their products with the PIC where there are no requirements. Consumers can identify the plastic types based on the codes usually found at the base or at the side of the plastic products, including food/chemical packaging and containers. The PIC is usually not present on packaging films, since it is not practical to collect and recycle most of this type of waste.\n\nThe Ocean Conservancy reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. Scientific American reported that China dumps 30% of all plastics in the ocean, followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2015, the United States produced 34.5 million tons of plastic, which was about 13% of total waste. About 9% of that was recycled. Most of the waste stream is biodegradable but plastic though only 13% of the waste stream is persistent and accumulates.\n\nLow national plastic recycling rates have been due to the complexity of sorting and processing, unfavorable economics, and consumer confusion about which plastics can actually be recycled. Part of the confusion has been due to the use of the resin identification code, which is only found on a subset of plastic products, and which includes the recycling symbol as part of its design. The resin identification code is stamped or printed on the bottom of containers and surrounded by a triangle of arrows. (See the table in Plastic.) The intent of these symbols was to make it easier to identify the type of plastics used to make a particular container and to indicate that the plastic is potentially recyclable. The question that remains is which types of plastics can be recycled by local recycling centers. In many communities, not all types of plastics are accepted for sidewalk recycling collection programs due to the high processing costs and complexity of the equipment required to recycle certain materials. There is also sometimes a seemingly low demand for the recycled product depending on a recycling center's proximity to entities seeking recycled materials. Another major barrier is that the cost to recycle certain materials and the corresponding market price for those materials sometimes does not present any opportunity for profit. The best example of this is polystyrene (commonly called styrofoam), although some communities, like Brookline, Massachusetts, are moving toward banning the distribution of polystyrene containers by local food and coffee businesses.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the three isomers of dimethylbenzene known collectively as xylenes. The \"p-\" stands for \"para-\", indicating that the two methyl groups in \"p\"-xylene occupy the diametrically opposite substituent positions 1 and 4. It is in the positions of the two methyl groups, their arene substitution pattern, that it differs from the other isomers, \"o\"-xylene and \"m\"-xylene. All have the same chemical formula CH(CH). All xylene isomers are colorless and highly flammable. The odor threshold of \"p\"-xylene is 0.62 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe production of \"p\"-xylene is industrially significant, with annual demand estimated at 37 million tons in 2014, and still on the increase. \"p\"-Xylene is produced by catalytic reforming of petroleum naphtha as part of the BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and the xylene isomers) extracted from the catalytic reformate. The \"p\"-xylene is then separated out in a series of distillation, adsorption or crystallization and reaction processes from the \"m\"-xylene, \"o\"-xylene, and ethylbenzene. Its melting point is the highest among this series of isomers, but simple crystallization does not allow easy purification due to the formation of eutectic mixtures.\n\nSuch separation procedures are major cost factors in the production of \"p\"-xylene, and the search for alternative methods continues. For example, a reverse-osmosis technique has been proposed to improve various aspects of the processes.\n\n\"p\"-Xylene is an important chemical feedstock. Among other industrial applications, it is a raw material in the large scale synthesis of various polymers. In particular it is a component in the production of terephthalic acid for polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (generally known as PET). It also may be polymerised directly to produce Parylene.\n\nXylenes are not acutely toxic, for example the LD50 (rat, oral) is 4300 mg/kg. Effects vary with animal and xylene isomer. \n\nConcerns with xylenes focus on narcotic effects. Overexposure of \"p\"-xylene in humans can cause headache, fatigue, dizziness, listlessness, confusion, irritability, gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea and loss of appetite, flushing of the face, and a feeling of increased body heat. \"p\"-Xylene vapor exposure over the recommended exposure limit of 100 parts per million (ppm) can cause irritation to eye, nose, and throat and possible chest tightening and an abnormal gait.\n\n\"p\"-Xylene occurs naturally in petroleum and coal tar. It is emitted by most combustion sources, including automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke.\nInhaling \"p\"-xylene can cause dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and nausea. If exposure through inhalation occurs, first aid includes fresh air, rest and possible medical attention. Through the use of ventilation or breathing protection, exposure to \"p\"-xylene through inhalation can be prevented.\n\nExposure of \"p\"-xylene through the skin can cause dry skin and redness. If skin exposure occurs, first aid includes rinsing and then washing the affected area with soap and water as well as removing any contaminated clothing and thoroughly cleaning and drying before reuse. Exposure can be prevented through the use of protective gloves.\n\nExposure of \"p\"-xylene to eyes can cause redness and pain. If eyes are exposed, first aid includes rinsing of the eyes with water for several minutes, removal of contact lenses if applicable, and medical attention. Eye exposure can be prevented through the use of safety glasses or safety goggles.\n\nIngestion of \"p\"-xylene can result in a burning sensation, abdominal pain, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea. If \"p\"-xylene is ingested one's mouth should be rinsed and vomiting should not be induced. Further medical attention should be sought. Ingestion can be prevented by not eating, drinking, or smoking when working with \"p\"-xylene.\n\n\"p\"-Xylene can cause issues with the central nervous system and if swallowed could cause chemical pneumonitis when breathed into the lungs.\n\nLiquid \"p\"-xylene exposure to the skin over long periods of time can remove the fat from the skin. The substance may also have effects on the central nervous system. Exposure can enhance hearing loss caused by noise exposure. Animal tests suggest that this substance could cause damage to human development and reproductive systems.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999139", "title": "Turbomachinery", "text": "Turbomachinery\n\nTurbomachinery, in mechanical engineering, describes machines that transfer energy between a rotor and a fluid, including both turbines and compressors. While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.\n\nThese two types of machines are governed by the same basic relationships including Newton's second Law of Motion and Euler's pump and turbine equation for compressible fluids. Centrifugal pumps are also turbomachines that transfer energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.\n\nThe first turbomachines could be identified as water wheels, which appeared between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE in the Mediterranean region. These were used throughout the medieval period and began the first Industrial Revolution. When steam power started to be used, as the first power source driven by the combustion of a fuel rather than renewable natural power sources, this was as reciprocating engines. Primitive turbines and conceptual designs for them, such as the smoke jack, appeared intermittently but the temperatures and pressures required for a practically efficient turbine exceeded the manufacturing technology of the time. The first patent for gas turbines were filed in 1791 by John Barber. Practical hydroelectric water turbines and steam turbines did not appear until the 1880s. Gas turbines appeared in the 1930s.\n\nThe first impulse type turbine was created by Carl Gustaf de Laval in 1883. This was closely followed by the first practical reaction type turbine in 1884, built by Charles Parsons. Parsons’ first design was a multi-stage axial-flow unit, which George Westinghouse acquired and began manufacturing in 1895, while General Electric acquired de Laval's designs in 1897. Since then, development has skyrocketed from Parsons’ early design, producing 0.746 kW, to modern nuclear steam turbines producing upwards of 1500 MW. Today, steam turbines account for roughly 90% of electrical power generated in the United States. Then the first functioning industrial gas turbines were used in the late 1890s to power street lights (Meher-Homji, 2000).\n\nIn general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and closed turbomachines. Open machines such as propellers, windmills, and unshrouded fans act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas closed machines operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.\n\nTurbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the axis of rotation, they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.\n\nTurbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those that absorb energy to increase the fluid pressure, i.e. pumps, fans, and compressors, and those that produce energy such as turbines by expanding flow to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain pumps, fans, compressors and turbines. These components are essential in almost all mechanical equipment systems, such as power and refrigeration cycles.\n\nAny device that extracts energy from or imparts energy to a continuously moving stream of fluid can be called a turbomachine. Elaborating, a turbomachine is a power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a rotating element, the rotor; the action of the rotor changes the energy level of the continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans are all members of this family of machines.\n\nIn contrast to positive displacement machines (particularly of the reciprocating type which are low speed machines based on the mechanical and volumetric efficiency considerations), the majority of turbomachines run at comparatively higher speeds without any mechanical problems and volumetric efficiency close to one hundred percent.\n\nTurbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the direction of energy conversion:\n\n\nTurbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the nature of flow path through the passage of the rotor:\n\"Axial flow turbomachines\" - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or mainly parallel to the axis of rotation, the device is termed an axial flow turbomachine. The radial component of the fluid velocity is negligible. Since there is no change in the direction of the fluid, several axial stages can be used to increase power output.\n\nA Kaplan turbine is an example of an axial flow turbine.\n\nIn the figure:\n\n\"Radial flow turbomachines\" - When the path of the throughflow is wholly or mainly in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the device is termed a radial flow turbomachine. Therefore, the change of radius between the entry and the exit is finite. A Radial turbomachine can be inward or outward flow type depending on the purpose that needs to be served. Outward flow type increases the energy level of the fluid and vice versa. Due to continuous change in direction, several radial stages are generally not used.\n\nA centrifugal pump is an example of a radial flow turbomachine.\n\n\"Mixed flow turbomachines\" – When axial and radial flow are both present and neither is negligible, the device is termed a mixed flow turbomachine. It combines flow and force components of both radial and axial types.\n\nA Francis turbine is an example of a mixed-flow turbine.\n\nTurbomachines can finally be classified on the relative magnitude of the pressure changes that take place across a stage:\n\"Impulse Turbomachines\" operate by accelerating and changing the flow direction of fluid through a stationary nozzle (the stator blade) onto the rotor blade. The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the enthalpy of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.\n\nNewton's second law describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.\n\nA Pelton wheel is an impulse design.\n\"Reaction Turbomachines\" operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.\n\nNewton's third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.\n\nMost turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.\n\nThe following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines. They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.\n\nHydro electric- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates electricity\n\nSteam turbines- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\nGas turbines- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\nWindmills- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a steam turbine, but works with an infinite supply of wind.\n\nSteam turbine- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they don't need to power a whole town. They aren't very common because of their high initial cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with it.\n\nGas turbines- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels. They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013), and are much smaller for a given amount of power.\nFlow of air through a turbocharger and engine\n\nWater jet- Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air. Water jets are best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.\n\nTurbochargers- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel, much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and compressing outside air into the engine.\n\nSuperchargers- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from the engine to spin a screw or vane, some way to suck in and compress the air into the engine.\n\nPumps- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis to turbomachinery (Škorpík, 2017).\n\nAir compressors- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.\n\nFans- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this way.\n\nGas turbines- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial turbines, and are most often the most advanced.\n\nTurbopumps- Rocket engines require very high propellant pressures and mass flow rates, meaning their pumps require a lot of power. One of the most common solutions to this issue is to use a turbopump that extracts energy from an energetic fluid flow. The source of this energetic fluid flow could be one or a combination of many things, including the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, the combustion of a portion of the propellants, or even the heating of cryogenic propellants run through coolant jackets in the combustion chamber's walls.\n\nMany types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist. Below is a partial list of these types. What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all. Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases. This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.\n\n\n"}

Coffea robusta), commonly known as robusta coffee, is a species of coffee that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known as \"Coffea robusta\", the plant is scientifically identified as \"Coffea canephora\", which has two main varieties, \"robusta\" and \"nganda\".\n\nRobusta is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known by the synonym \"Coffea robusta\", the plant is currently scientifically identified as \"Coffea canephora\", which has two main varieties, \"C. c. robusta\" and \"C. c. nganda\". The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 m tall. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10–11 months for cherries to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans. \n\nThe robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, contains more caffeine (2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%), and contains less sugar (3–7% compared to arabica's 6–9%). As it is less susceptible to pests and disease, robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica.\n\nOriginating in upland forests in Ethiopia, \"C. canephora\" grows indigenously in Western and Central Africa from Liberia to Tanzania and south to Angola. It was not recognized as a species of \"Coffea\" until 1897, over a hundred years after \"Coffea arabica\". It is also reportedly naturalized in Borneo, French Polynesia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles. In 1927 a hybrid between robusta and arabica was found in Timor. This strain was subsequently used to breed rust-resistant plants.\n\nRobusta coffee is coffee made from beans of the plant \"Coffea canephora\", a sturdy species with low acidity and high bitterness. \"C. canephora\" beans, widely known by the synonym \"Coffea robusta\", are used primarily in instant coffee, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee blends.\n\nRobusta has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants, and is less susceptible to disease than arabica coffea. It represents 43% of global coffee production, with arabica constituting the remainder except for the 1% constituted by coffea liberica\n\nIt is mostly grown in Vietnam, where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, though it is also grown in India, Africa and Brazil, where it is often called \"conilon\". In recent years, Vietnam, which produces mostly robusta, has become the world's largest exporter of robusta coffee, accounting for over 40% of the total production. It surpasses Brazil (25% of the world's production), Indonesia (13%), India (5%), and Uganda (5%). Brazil is still the biggest coffee producer in the world, producing one-third of the world's coffee, though 69% of that is \"C. arabica\".\n\nRobusta is easier to care for and has a greater crop yield than \"C. arabica\", so is cheaper to produce. Roasted robusta beans produce a strong, full-bodied coffee with a distinctive earthy flavour, but usually with more bitterness than arabica due to its pyrazine content. Since arabica beans are believed to have smoother taste with more acidity and a richer flavour, they are often considered superior, while the harsher robusta beans are mostly used as a filler in lower-grade coffee blends. However, the powerful flavour can be desirable in a blend to give it perceived \"strength\" and \"finish\", noticeably in Italian coffee culture. Good-quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends, at about 10–15%, to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as \"crema\"). It is besides used as a stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, antipyretic and relieves spasmodic asthma.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma and descended from Philip, Duke of Parma, the third son of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nBorn in Florence, Robert was the elder son of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois, daughter of Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry and granddaughter of King Charles X of France. He succeeded his father to the ducal throne in 1854 upon the latter's assassination, when he was only six, while his mother stood as regent.\n\nWhen Robert was eleven years old, he was deposed, as Piedmontese troops annexed other Italian states, ultimately to form the Kingdom of Italy. Despite losing his throne, Robert and his family enjoyed considerable wealth, traveling in a private train of more than a dozen cars from his castles at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna, to Villa Pianore in northwest Italy, and the magnificent château de Chambord in France.\n\nOn 5 April 1869, while in exile in Rome, he married Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1849–1882), daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. She was his half first cousin once removed, as her father (Ferdinand II) and Robert's maternal grandmother (Princess Caroline Ferdinande of Bourbon-Two Sicilies) were half-siblings, both being children of Francis I of the Two Sicilies.\n\nMaria Pia belonged to the deposed Royal Family of the Two Sicilies and was thus a Bourbon, like her husband. She bore him 12 children, before dying in childbirth:\n\nAfter his first wife's death in childbirth, he remarried on 15 October 1884 to Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, daughter of the deposed King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife, Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Maria Antonia was his second cousin once removed, as her paternal grandmother (Charlotte of Spain) and Robert's paternal great-grandmother (Maria Luisa of Spain) were siblings, both being children of Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma.\nShe bore him another 12 children:\n\nLess than four months after Robert's death in November 1907, the Grand Marshal of the Austrian court declared six of the children of his first marriage legally incompetent (they had severe mental retardation), at the behest of his widow, Maria Antonia. Nonetheless, Robert's primary heir was his son Elias, the youngest son of his first marriage and the only one of his sons by that marriage to beget children of his own. Elias also became the legal guardian of his six elder siblings.\n\nAlthough the eldest half-brothers, Sixte and Xavier, eventually sued their half-brother Elias for trying to obtain a greater share of the ducal fortune, they lost in the French courts, leaving the issue of Robert's second marriage with modest prospects. Some of his younger sons served in the Austrian armed forces.\n\nRobert's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.\n\nPatrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Duke Robert were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robert, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.\n\nRobert is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians.\n\nRobert's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.\n\n"}

He inherited a fortune and enlarged it through business dealings, then devoted much of his money and efforts to a wide variety of philanthropic purposes. His will included funds to expand the New York Hospital, now called NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, where the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic was established.\n\nWilliam Payne Whitney was born on March 20, 1876 to William Collins Whitney (1841–1904) and Flora Payne (1842–1893). His siblings included: elder brother, Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930), Pauline Payne Whitney (1874–1916), and younger sister, Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887–1968).\n\nWhitney was educated at the Groton School. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and captained the Yale rowing team. After graduating in 1898, Whitney then studied law at the Harvard Law School, receiving his Bachelor of Laws in 1901.\n\nIn addition to a substantial inheritance from his father, Payne Whitney inherited $63,000,000 from his uncle, Col. Oliver Hazard Payne. Amongst his many investments, Whitney had major holdings in banking, tobacco, railroads, mining and oil. He was a member of the board of directors and/or an executive officer of several large corporations, including the City Bank New York, and the Great Northern Paper Company, and the Northern Finance Corporation.\n\nA horse racing enthusiast in the tradition of his father and brother, Payne Whitney's Greentree Stable, named for their Long Island estate, was a very significant racing and breeding operation for thoroughbred horses.\n\nThroughout his life, Payne Whitney was involved in philanthropic work for a variety of causes. A trustee of the New York Public Library, in 1923 he gave the library $12,000,000. Whitney made charitable contributions to the rowing team at his alma mater, Yale University, including donating funds to build a dormitory for the crew.\n\nHis will bequeathed more than $20 million to establish the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at Cornell University's medical school, now called Weill Cornell Medicine, and New York Hospital, now New York–Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.\n\nSmaller amounts to other educational and medical institutions. Although he had contributed $1,000,000 to the Yale Endowment Fund shortly before his death, sufficient estate funds were given to enable Yale's construction of the 9½ story Payne Whitney Gymnasium that too was completed in 1932. As a tribute to him, a road in Manhasset was named after him, Payne Whitney Lane.\n\nOn September 20, 1911, Whitney was aboard the RMS Olympic when it was rammed by the warship, HMS Hawke. Olympic was the sister ship of the RMS Titanic.\n\nIn 1902, Whitney married Helen Julia Hay (1875–1944), the daughter of then-United States Secretary of State (and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom) John Hay. Their Stanford White-designed mansion, Payne Whitney House at 972 Fifth Avenue, was a wedding gift from his maternal uncle, Oliver Hazard Payne.

{"id": "1999184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999184", "title": "Our Gang (novel)", "text": "Our Gang (novel)\n\nOur Gang (1971) is Philip Roth's fifth novel. A marked departure from his previous book, the popular \"Portnoy's Complaint\", \"Our Gang\" is a political satire written in the form of a closet drama. Centered on the character of \"Trick E. Dixon\", a caricature of then-President Richard Nixon, the book takes its cue from an actual quote from Nixon:\n\nAs the book is written entirely as dialogue, Roth uses stage directions, such as \"impish endearing smile\", when Dixon is talking.\n\nThe book is six chapters long. Chapter one is entitled \"Tricky comforts a troubled citizen\". In the chapter, the citizen in question is concerned with William Calley's killing of twenty-two Vietnamese villagers at My Lai, but he is \"seriously troubled by the possibility that Lieutenant Calley may have committed an abortion\". Throughout the chapter, Dixon defends the notion that Calley may have killed a pregnant woman, covering many factors; If the pregnant woman was \"showing\" or not, if Calley could have communicated with her, if he really did know she was pregnant, whether the woman asked Calley to give her an abortion or not, etc. Trick E. Dixon manages to defend Calley well until the citizen asks if Calley could have given her an abortion against her will, as \"an outright form of murder\", and Dixon gives the following answer, which is supposed to reflect his background as a lawyer and his hard-to-pin-down nature:\n\nWell, of course, that is a very iffy question, isn't it? What we lawyers call a hypothetical instance—isn't it? If you will remember, we are only \"supposing\" there to have been a pregnant woman in the ditch at My Lai to begin with. Suppose there \"wasn't\" a pregnant woman in that ditch—which, in fact, seems from all evidence to have been the case. We are then involved in a totally academic discussion.\n\nIn chapter two, entitled \"Tricky holds a press conference\", Dixon takes questions from reporters with names to suit their respective personalities. The reporters are called Mr. Asslick (who, as his name suggests, \"sucks up\" to the President), Mr. Daring (who poses, as suggested, the more daring suggestions in the style of investigative journalism), Mr. Respectful (who acts rather meekly compared to some of his compatriots), Mr. Shrewd (who, being slightly more daring than Mr. Daring, suggests President Dixon may be giving voting rights to the unborn for purely political reasons), Miss Charming (the typical female reporter often stereotyped in media as 'charming' indeed), Mr. Practical (concerned not with the politics of the situation, but the when and the how much of the situation).\n\nFrom this starting point, Roth satirizes Nixon and his cabinet—particularly Henry Kissinger (\"Highbrow coach\") and Spiro Agnew (\"Vice President-what's-his-name\")—as Tricky tries to deny that he supports sexual intercourse, provoking a group of Boy Scouts to riot in Washington, D.C. in which three are shot. Tricky tries to pin the blame on baseball player Curt Flood and the nation of Denmark, managing to obliterate the city of Copenhagen in the process. After an operation to remove his upper lip sweat gland, he is eventually assassinated by being drowned in a giant baggie filled with water, his corpse in the fetal position. Tricky ends the novel in Hell, campaigning against Satan for the position of Devil.\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Dwight MacDonald described the book as \"far-fetched, unfair, tasteless, disturbing, logical, coarse and very funny\" and \"in short, a masterpiece\". On the other hand, \"The New Republic\" compared the novel to \"Macbird\" while calling it \"tasteless and dreadful\".\n"}
{"id": "1999186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999186", "title": "XGameStation series", "text": "XGameStation series\n\nThe XGameStation is a series of embedded systems, primarily designed as a dedicated home video game console, created by Andre LaMothe and sold by his company Nurve Networks LLC. Originally designed to teach electronics and video game development to programmers, newer models concentrate more on logic design, multi-core programming, game programming, and embedded system design and programming with popular microcontrollers.\n\nThe XGameStation was originally conceived of as a handheld system called the nanoGear based around the 68HC12 microprocessor, a modern derivative of the 6809. The system would also contain modern derivatives of the 6502 and Z-80 microprocessors, for retro coders and hackers, and to make emulation of classic computer and video game systems easier. After several iterations, the plan changed to use an ARM microprocessor and an FPGA on which a custom designed GPU was implemented. But after finishing this project it was decided that the resulting system was cost prohibitive and much too advanced for beginners. Instead, the plan was changed again finally resulting in the XGS Micro Edition, based on the SX52 microcontroller. The ARM and FPGA-based system was renamed the XGS Mega Edition after the release of the Micro Edition, and though planned to be sold, it was never released.\n\nThe XGS Micro Edition is a pre-built video game console based around the SX52 microcontroller, which is a high-speed PIC microcontroller running at 80 MHz for a total of 80 MIPS. The color television video signal is generated in software on the microcontroller. Sound is generated by a ROHM BU8763 chip. For input, the system has a single PS/2 connector for keyboard or mouse input, as well as two DB-9 for connecting Atari-compatible joysticks. Programming is done in assembly language or in a custom written XGS Basic, either on a PC and then transferred to the console or on the system itself. It has add-on packs for creating your own expansion card and electronic experimenting kit. The Micro Edition contains the XGameStation unit, \"Designing Your Own Video Game Console\" - a detailed book in PDF format teaching the basics of electronics, a power supply, A/V cables, a joystick, a COM cable, and a few extras such as a PDF version of one of Andre LaMothe's previous books \"Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus\".\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the SX52 Processor is its ability to create a color video signal using only software, and still have the power to simultaneously run the software that uses this video display in order to create an elementary video game or game demo. These latter programs may or may not evolve into a real (playable) game, as often the memory of the SX52 processor is too restricted to support them. Some people also write non-game video demos to show off the video display possibilities of the system.\n\nThe SX52 has been made obsolete by Parallax, the company that now packages the SX-series of micro controller dies, made by Ubicom, because they did not have a package with 52 pins. However, according to the people at XGameStation, there are enough SX52 chips available for all their future needs.\nOn July 31, 2009, Parallax announced that the whole line of SX microcontrollers will be discontinued.\n\nThe Pico Edition is a simplified version of the Micro Edition in a build-it-yourself kit. The Pico Edition is based around the SX28 microcontroller, which, like the SX52, is a high-speed PIC microcontroller running at 80 MHz for a total of 80 MIPS, though it has less RAM and Flash capacity. Like the Micro Edition, the color television video signal is generated in software on the microcontroller. However, unlike the Micro Edition, the audio signal is also generated directly by the microcontroller and not by an external chip. For input, the system simply reads pushbuttons connected to its input pins. Programming is done in assembly language or in a custom written XGS Basic, on a PC and then transferred to the console. The Pico comes in several different kit forms: the 1.0 kit which comes with a breadboard, a CD with assembly instructions and selected chapters of the same ebook as the Micro Edition and the same extras, the SX28, and the discrete components of the system; and the 2.0 kit, which consists of the 1.0 kit and a PCB (which is also available as an add-on separately); and the Game Console Starter Kit, which includes the 2.0 kit, a hard copy of \"The Black Art of Video Game Console Design\", and a soldering iron and solder.\n\nReleased on December 26, 2008, the XGS AVR 8-Bit and XGS PIC 16-Bit development systems are embedded system development kits, meant to be very competitive entry/midrange development kits for their respective microcontrollers. The systems were designed together and so share much of the same design other than the main processor. The video signal is generated in software like the XGS Micro and Pico Editions; however, there is color helper hardware to generate the colorburst part of the video signal. The audio signal is also generated directly by the microcontroller. For input, like the XGS Micro, two DB-9 ports and a PS/2 port are supplied. However, instead of being compatible with Atari joysticks, the DB-9 ports are compatible with Nintendo gamepads (though directly connecting an NES or SNES controller would require a pin adapter). Unlike the prior XGS and Hydra systems, programming is primarily in C/C++, utilizing system-specific libraries, though assembly programming and a custom written XGS Basic are also available. The XGS Basic code runs on both systems without modification. Unlike the XGS Micro Edition, code cannot be edited on the system itself - a PC is required. The XGS AVR 8-Bit processor is an Atmel MEGA AVR 644P with 64K FLASH and 4K SRAM running at over 28 MIPS. The XGS PIC 16-Bit processor is a PIC24 with 256K FLASH and 16K SRAM running at over 40 MIPS.\n\nIn 2006 Andre LaMothe launched his new HYDRA Game Development Kit, a much more powerful system than the XGS Micro Edition. Unlike the other systems by Nurve, the Hydra does not carry the XGS branding. The Hydra uses the multi-core Parallax Propeller microcontroller, which has an architecture resembling the Cell microprocessor used in the PlayStation 3. The Propeller runs at 80 MHz and uses eight processor cores, called COGs, to reach a performance of 160 MIPS. It also has much more memory than the Micro Edition's SX52: 32K RAM and a 32K ROM which contains a bitmap font for the video display generator, (the Propeller can generate a high quality VGA or PAL/NTSC color picture using software and some special support logic built into each CPU core), tables for mathematical function, and an interpreter for the multi threaded SPIN language. Each CPU core also has its own 2K RAM (512 32bit words) of dedicated memory. For input, the system has two PS/2 ports for a mouse and keyboard (which are sold with the system) and two NES compatible game controller ports (one game controller is included). The system also has a mini USB interface for programming the system, an RJ-11 Ethernet port, and a 128K serial Flash EEPROM for storage. There are also add-ons, such as a 512K external RAM card.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999223", "title": "Lionel Stander", "text": "Lionel Stander\n\nLionel Jay Stander (January 11, 1908 – November 30, 1994) was an American actor in films, radio, theater and television.\n\nLionel Stander was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York, to Russian-Jewish immigrants, the first of three children.\n\nAccording to newspaper interviews with Stander, as a teenager he appeared in the silent film \"Men of Steel\" (1926), perhaps as an extra, since he is not listed in the credits.\n\nDuring his one year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he appeared in the student productions \"The Muse of the Unpublished Writer\", and \"The Muse and the Movies: A Comedy of Greenwich Village\".\n\nStander's acting career began in 1928, as Cop and First Fairy in \"Him\" by E. E. Cummings, at the Provincetown Playhouse. He claimed that he got the roles because one of them required shooting craps, which he did well, and a friend in the company volunteered him. He appeared in a series of short-lived plays through the early 1930s, including \"The House Beautiful\", which Dorothy Parker famously derided as \"the play lousy\".\n\nIn 1932, Stander landed his first credited film role in the Warner-Vitaphone short feature \"In the Dough\" (1932), with Fatty Arbuckle and Shemp Howard. He made several other shorts, the last being \"The Old Grey Mayor\" (1935) with Bob Hope in 1935. That same year, he was cast in a feature, Ben Hecht's \"The Scoundrel\" (1935), with Noël Coward. He moved to Hollywood and signed a contract with Columbia Pictures. Stander was in a string of films over the next three years, appearing most notably in Frank Capra's \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) with Gary Cooper, \"Meet Nero Wolfe\" (1936) playing Archie Goodwin, \"The League of Frightened Men\" (1937), and \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March.\n\nStander's distinctive rumbling voice, tough-guy demeanor, and talent with accents made him a popular radio actor. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was on \"The Eddie Cantor Show\", Bing Crosby's KMH show, the \"Lux Radio Theater\" production of \"A Star Is Born\", \"The Fred Allen Show\", the \"Mayor of the Town\" series with Lionel Barrymore and Agnes Moorehead, \"Kraft Music Hall\" on NBC, \"Stage Door Canteen\" on CBS, the \"Lincoln Highway Radio Show\" on NBC, and \"The Jack Paar Show\", among others.\n\nIn 1941, he starred in a short-lived radio show called \"The Life of Riley\" on CBS, no relation to the radio, film, and television character later made famous by William Bendix. Stander played the role of Spider Schultz in both Harold Lloyd's film \"The Milky Way\" (1936) and its remake ten years later, \"The Kid from Brooklyn\" (1946), starring Danny Kaye. He was a regular on Danny Kaye's zany comedy-variety radio show on CBS (1946–1947), playing himself as \"just the elevator operator\" amidst the antics of Kaye, future \"Our Miss Brooks\" star Eve Arden, and bandleader Harry James.\n\nAlso during the 1940s, he played several characters on \"The Woody Woodpecker\" and \"Andy Panda\" animated theatrical shorts, produced by Walter Lantz. For \"Woody Woodpecker\", he provided the voice of Buzz Buzzard, but was blacklisted from the Lantz studio in 1951 and was replaced by Dal McKennon.\n\nStrongly of communist ideology and pro-labor, Stander espoused a variety of social and political causes, and was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. At a SAG meeting held during a 1937 studio technicians' strike, he told the assemblage of 2000 members: \"With the eyes of the whole world on this meeting, will it not give the Guild a black eye if its members continue to cross picket lines?\" (The \"NY Times\" reported: \"Cheers mingled with boos greeted the question.\") Stander also supported the Conference of Studio Unions in its fight against the Mob-influenced International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Also in 1937, Ivan F. Cox, a deposed officer of the San Francisco longshoremen's union, sued Stander and a host of others, including union leader Harry Bridges, actors Fredric March, Franchot Tone, Mary Astor, James Cagney, Jean Muir, and director William Dieterle. The charge, according to \"Time\" magazine, was \"conspiring to propagate Communism on the Pacific Coast, causing Mr. Cox to lose his job\".\n\nIn 1938, Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn allegedly called Stander \"a Red son of a bitch\" and threatened a US$100,000 fine against any studio that renewed his contract. Despite critical acclaim for his performances, Stander's film work dropped off drastically. After appearing in 15 films in 1935 and 1936, he was in only six in 1937 and 1938. This was followed by just six films from 1939 through 1943, none made by major studios, the most notable being \"Guadalcanal Diary\" (1943).\n\nStander was among the first group of Hollywood actors to be subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1940 for supposed Communist activities. At a grand jury hearing in Los Angeles in August 1940—the transcript of which was shortly released to the press—John R. Leech, the self-described former \"chief functionary\" of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, named Stander as a CP member, along with more than 15 other Hollywood notables, including Franchot Tone, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Clifford Odets and Budd Schulberg. Stander subsequently forced himself into the grand jury hearing, and the district attorney cleared him of the allegations.\n\nStander appeared in no films between 1944 and 1945. Then, with HUAC's attentions focused elsewhere due to World War II, he played in a number of mostly second-rate pictures from independent studios through the late 1940s. These include Ben Hecht's \"Specter of the Rose\" (1946); the Preston Sturges comedy \"The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\" (1947) with Harold Lloyd; and \"Trouble Makers\" (1948) with The Bowery Boys. One classic emerged from this period of his career, the Preston Sturges comedy \"Unfaithfully Yours\" (1948) with Rex Harrison.\n\nIn 1947, HUAC turned its attention once again to Hollywood. That October, Howard Rushmore, who had belonged to the CPUSA in the 1930s and written film reviews for the \"Daily Worker\", testified that writer John Howard Lawson, whom he named as a Communist, had \"referred to Lionel Stander as a perfect example of how a Communist should not act in Hollywood.\" Stander was again blacklisted from films, though he played on TV, radio, and in the theater.\n\nIn March 1951, actor Larry Parks, after pleading with HUAC investigators not to force him to \"crawl through the mud\" as an informer, named several people as Communists in a \"closed-door session\", which made the newspapers two days later. He testified that he knew Stander, but did not recall attending any CP meetings with him.\n\nAt a HUAC hearing in April 1951, actor Marc Lawrence named Stander as a member of his Hollywood Communist \"cell\", along with screenwriter Lester Cole and screenwriter Gordon Kahn. Lawrence testified that Stander \"was the guy who introduced me to the party line\", and that Stander said that by joining the CP, he would \"get to know the dames more\" — which Lawrence, who did not enjoy film-star looks, thought a good idea. Upon hearing of this, Stander shot off a telegram to HUAC chair John S. Wood, calling Lawrence's testimony that he was a Communist \"ridiculous\" and asking to appear before the Committee, so he could swear to that under oath. The telegram concluded: \"I respectfully request an opportunity to appear before you at your earliest possible convenience. Be assured of my cooperation.\" Two days later, Stander sued Lawrence for $500,000 for slander. Lawrence left the country (\"fled\", according to Stander) for Europe.\n\nAfter that, Stander was blacklisted from TV and radio. He continued to act in theater roles, and played Ludlow Lowell in the 1952-53 revival of \"Pal Joey\" on Broadway and on tour.\n\nTwo years passed before Stander was issued the requested subpoena. Finally, in May 1953, he testified at a HUAC hearing in New York, where he made front-page headlines nationwide by being uproariously uncooperative, memorialized in the Eric Bentley play, \"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been\". The \"New York Times\" headline was \"Stander Lectures House Red Inquiry.\" In a dig at bandleader Artie Shaw, who had tearfully claimed in a Committee hearing that he had been \"duped\" by the Communist Party, Stander testified, \n\"I am not a dupe, or a dope, or a moe, or a schmoe... I was absolutely conscious of what I was doing, and I am not ashamed of anything I said in public or private.\"\n\nOther notable statements during Stander's 1953 HUAC testimony:\n\nStander was blacklisted from the late 1940s until 1965; perhaps the longest period.\n\nAfter that, Stander's acting career went into a free fall. He worked as a stockbroker on Wall Street, a journeyman stage actor, a corporate spokesman—even a New Orleans Mardi Gras king. He didn't return to Broadway until 1961 (and then only briefly in a flop) and to film in 1963, in the low-budget \"The Moving Finger\" (although he did provide, uncredited, the voice-over narration for the 1961 film noir \"Blast of Silence\".)\n\nLife improved for Stander when he moved to London in 1964 to act in Bertolt Brecht's \"Saint Joan of the Stockyards\", directed by Tony Richardson, for whom he'd acted on Broadway, along with Christopher Plummer, in a 1963 production of Brecht's \"The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\". In 1965, he was featured in the film \"Promise Her Anything\". That same year Richardson cast him in the black comedy about the funeral industry, \"The Loved One\", based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh, with an all-star cast including Jonathan Winters, Robert Morse, Liberace, Rod Steiger, Paul Williams and many others. In 1966, Roman Polanski cast Stander in his only starring role, as the thug Dickie in \"Cul-de-sac\", opposite Françoise Dorléac and Donald Pleasence.\n\nStander stayed in Europe and eventually settled in Rome, where he appeared in many spaghetti Westerns, most notably playing a bartender named Max in Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West.\" He played the role of the villainous mob boss in Fernando Di Leo's 1972 poliziottescho thriller \"Caliber 9\". In Rome he connected with Robert Wagner, who cast him in an episode of \"It Takes a Thief\" that was shot there. Stander's few English-language films in the 1970s include \"The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight\" with Robert De Niro and Jerry Orbach, Steven Spielberg's \"1941\", and Martin Scorsese's \"New York, New York\", which also starred De Niro and Liza Minnelli.\n\nStander played a supporting role in the TV film \"Revenge Is My Destiny\" with Chris Robinson. He played a lounge comic modeled after the real-life Las Vegas comic Joe E. Lewis, who used to begin his act by announcing \"Post Time\" as he sipped his ever-present drink.\n\nAfter 15 years abroad, Stander moved back to the U.S. for the role he is now most famous for: Max, the loyal butler, cook, and chauffeur to the wealthy, amateur detectives played by Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers on the 1979–1984 television series \"Hart to Hart\" (and a subsequent series of \"Hart to Hart\" made-for-television films). In 1982, Stander won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nIn 1986, he became the voice of Kup in \"\". In 1991 he was a guest star in the television series \"Dream On\", playing Uncle Pat in the episode \"Toby or Not Toby\". His final theatrical film role was as a dying hospital patient in \"The Last Good Time\" (1994), with Armin Mueller-Stahl and Olivia d'Abo, directed by Bob Balaban.\n\nStander was married six times, the first time in 1932 and the last in 1972. All but the last marriage ended in divorce. He fathered six daughters (one wife had no children, one had twins).\n\nStander died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California, in 1994 at age 86. He was buried in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999227", "title": "Alpini", "text": "Alpini\n\nThe Alpini are the Italian Army's mountain infantry speciality. Part of the army's infantry corps, the speciality distinguished itself in combat during World War I and World War II. Currently the active Alpini units are organized in two operational brigades, which are subordinated to the Alpine Troops Headquarters. The Alpini's name comes from their inceptive association with the Alps, the mountain range that Italy shares with France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. An individual soldier of the Alpini is called Alpino.\n\nEstablished in 1872, the Alpini are the oldest active mountain infantry in the world. Their original mission was to protect Italy's border with France and Austria-Hungary. In 1888 the Alpini deployed on their first mission abroad, in Africa, a continent to which they returned on several occasions and during various wars of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War I they fought a three-year campaign on the Alps against Austro-Hungarian Kaiserjäger and the German Alpenkorps in what has since become known as the \"War in snow and ice\". During World War II, the Alpini fought alongside the Axis forces primarily in the Balkans Campaigns and on the Eastern Front. \n\nDuring the Cold War the Alpini formed five brigades, which during the 1990s were reduced to two.\n\nIn 1872, Captain Giuseppe Perrucchetti published a study in the May edition of the Military Review (Italian: \"Rivista Militare\"). In the study, he proposed to assign the defence of mountain borders of the recently established Kingdom of Italy to soldiers recruited locally. Indeed, thanks to their knowledge of the surroundings and personal attachment to the area, they would be highly capable and better motivated defenders. Perrucchetti drew heavily on the work of Lieutenant General Agostino Ricci, who in 1868 had organised exercises in the mountains to assess the feasibility of a specialised mountain infantry corps. Five months after Perrucchetti's article, the first 15 Alpini companies were formed by Royal decree no. 1056. The units became active on October 15, 1872, making the Alpini the oldest active Mountain Infantry in the world.\n\nAt first the Alpini were organized as a militia, capable of defending Italy's northern mountainous borders. Austria's surrender in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 resulted in Italy annexing the province of Venetia, the northern borders of which coincided in large part with the Alpine Arch. Prior to gaining the new northern borders, homeland defence was based on the so-called \"Quadrilatero\" strategy. That outdated strategy, however, ignored the geopolitics of the new Italian Kingdom. It called for primary defence of the Po Valley region (\"\"Pianura Padana\"\") farther to the southwest, but left the Alpine region undefended (as it was considered a territory mainly unsuitable for military operations).\n\nRecruiting Italy's mountain valleys locals and organising them into a special corps was indeed an innovative idea. \nThey possessed superior knowledge of mountain territory and greatest adaptability to Alpine conditions. At the beginning, the mountain regions were divided into seven military districts, each commanded by an Officer and home to at least two Alpini companies, each consisting of 120 personnel. Soldiers were equipped with the Vetterli 1870 rifle. In 1873 nine more companies were added, thus totalling 24. In 1875, the companies doubled in size, having 250 soldiers and 5 officers, which were then organised into 7 Alpini battalions. Each battalion was named after one of the seats of the seven military districts:\n\nIn 1877, five Alpini mountain artillery batteries were formed and - in the following year - the Alpini had already grown to 36 mountain infantry companies organised into 10 battalions. On November 1, 1882, the Alpini organisation doubled in size to 72 companies and a total of 20 Alpini battalions. The latter plus 8 Alpini mountain artillery batteries were now organized into six numbered Alpini regiments and two Alpini mountain artillery brigades. Each battalion was named after the area it was required to defend in case of war:\n\nThe numbers used earlier to distinguish the battalions were dropped while - at the same time - the companies were now numbered from 1 to 72. In order to distinguish the battalions, soldiers and non-commissioned officers were issued thread tufts of various colors (the \"Nappina\"), which were added to the \"Cappello Alpino\": white for the First Bn., red for the Second Bn., and Green for the Third Bn. of each regiment. Special Bn. and Fourth Bn. were issued blue tufts. Soldiers of the Mountain Artillery units were issued a green tuft with a black patch in the middle onto which the number of the battery was written in yellow numbers.\n\nOn June 7, 1883, the green flames (Italian: \"\"fiamme verdi\"\") collar patch was introduced, thus making the Alpini officially a specialty within the Italian infantry corps. The \"Cappello Alpino\", with its black raven feather, was also introduced at that time. The distinctive headdress quickly led the Alpini to be nicknamed \"The Black feathers\" (Italian: \"\"Le Penne Nere\"\"). Officers hats had the black feather replaced with a white eagle feather. At first, the hat was a black felt hat, but as soon as the new green-grey uniform was adopted in 1909 the hat was changed to the distinctive grey felt still in service today.\n\nThe Alpini were also distinguished by the green cuffs on the dark blue tunics worn for full dress and barrack dress until 1915, and by green piping on their light blue/grey trousers. When grey-green service uniforms were trialled by the Alpini in 1906, before being adopted by the entire army in 1909, the distinctive green collar patches and typical headdress were retained.\n\nThe materials, weapons, and equipment of each battalion were stored in the major village of a specific area they were required to defend in case of war. Soldiers of a battalion were only recruited from that area. In 1887, the names of the battalions were changed from those of the defended areas to those of local villages. Therefore, e.g., the \"Edolo\" Bn. soldiers were recruited in the vicinity of that village Edolo - where the battalion's arsenal, training ground, and officer's housing were also located. Local recruitment generated strong bonds with and self-identification between the locals and the Alpini units, as men assigned to a single company were all recruited from the same village, and the companies from one valley were all part of the same battalion.\n\nIn 1887 the Mountain Troops Inspectorate (Italian: \"Ispettorato delle truppe alpine\") was established in Rome, and took administrative command of all Mountain troops. This led to the reorganization of the Alpini Corps: on August 1, 1887, the 7th Alpini Regiment was formed in Conegliano Veneto and assigned two battalions from the 6th regiment. The number of battalions had grown by two, thus reaching 22. On November 1, 1887, the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment was formed in Turin with nine batteries, each equipped with four 75 mm howitzers. The resulting new layout of the Alpini Corps was as follows:\n\nAlthough established as a defensive mountain warfare force, the \"1° Battaglione Alpini d’Africa\" (1st African Alpini Battalion) was established in 1887. The battalion's four companies were composed of volunteers taken from all other Alpini battalions. As part of the \"Corpo Speciale d'Africa\" (Special African Corps), the battalion deployed to Eritrea to take revenge for the lost battle of Dogali. The battalion returned on April 27, 1888, to Naples, having lost its commanding officer and 13 men due to tropical diseases.\n\nBack in Italy, eight mules were assigned to each Alpini company in the same year. The Vetterli 70 rifle was replaced by the newer Vetterli-Vitali mod. 70/87 rifle. Also, based on a general reorganization of the Italian militia system, 38 Alpini companies and 15 mountain batteries were assigned to active units of the Regio Esercito (Royal Italian Army). In 1892 the Alpini were the first troops to be issued with the new Mod. 91 rifle, which was replaced in 1897 by the Mod. 91TS version and remained in service until 1945.\n\nWhen the tensions between Italy and Abyssinia escalated into the First Italo–Abyssinian War the \"1° Battaglione Alpini d’Africa\" was reformed and sent to Eritrea again. It would soon become the first Alpini unit to engage combat. Four batteries of the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment were also sent to Eritrea to augment the four deployed brigades under command of Oreste Baratieri. The battalions' first engagement was on March 1, 1896, during the Battle of Adowa. The Alpini were outnumbered and heavily defeated by Abyssinian troops. Over 400 out of 530 men died, including the commanding officer, Lt.Col. Menini. After the battle, the first Gold Medal for Military Valor (Italian: \"Medaglia d'oro al valor militare\") was awarded to a member of the Alpini Corps: Capitan Pietro Cella and his Alpini from the 4th company occupied and held the \"Amba Rajo\" (English: Rajo Mountain) until March 2, thus allowing the rest of defeated Italian Army forces to flee. Capitan Cella and all his men died in the effort. In memory of their ultimate sacrifice, he has been awarded the Gold Medal for Military Valor (). After such a defeat, an Alpini expeditionary regiment with 5 battalions was formed and sent to Eritrea on March 7, 1896, but it saw little combat and was repatriated in June of the same year.\n\nDuring the 1900 Boxer Rebellion, a Mountain Artillery Battery was sent to China as part of the international relief force that lifted the siege of the International Compound in Beijing, and remained on garrison duty in Tianjin until the end of 1901. On November 13, 1902, after a short period of experimentation with skis the Alpini began to form specially-equipped and trained Skiing Companies (Italian: \"Compagnie Sciatori\"). After a heavy earthquake on September 8, 1905, in the Calabria region (Southern Italy), the Alpini deployed to the area for three months to assist in the clearance of debris and reconstruction efforts. They experienced a similar situation in 1908, after the devastating Messina earthquake.\n\nA massive expansion of the Alpini begun in 1909. On July 15 the 2nd Mountain Artillery Regiment was formed in Vicenza with four artillery groups and a total of 12 batteries. In 1908, two new battalions - namely the \"Tolmezzo\" and \"Pallanza\" (later renamed as \"Intra\" in 1909) - had already been formed and assigned to the 7th and 4th regiments, respectively. On October 1, 1909, the “Tolmezzo” and \"Gemona\" battalions from the 7th Alpini regiment, along with the newly raised Cividale battalion, became the three battalions of new 8th Alpini Regiment, based in Udine. The first commander of the 8th Alpini regiment was Col. Antonio Cantore, who would become a living legend to the Alpini during World War I. As the 8th Alpini regiment was formed, the Alpini could now count on 25 battalions organised into 8 regiments, 2 mountain artillery regiments with 24 batteries organised into 8 groups, and 75 reserve companies organised into 22 battalions. Reserve battalions were named after the valleys from where their soldiers, former Alpini, were recruited (also known as the 'Valle' battalions).\n\nIn 1910 the last pre-war Alpini battalion was established as the \"Belluno\" Bn. in the very same city.\n\nWhen Italy declared war on Turkey in 1911 in an attempt to conquer Libya, the Alpini units were once again deployed on desert combat. From 1911 to 1914, the Saluzzo, Mondovì, Ivrea, Verona, Tolmezzo, Feltre, Susa, Vestone, Fenestrelle, and Edolo battalions, together with the \"Torino-Susa\", \"Mondovì\", and \"Vicenza\" artillery groups, were deployed to Libya on missions of different duration. The first units to be sent to Libya were the Saluzzo (25 October 1911), Mondovì (3 November 1911), Ivrea (3 November 1911) and Verona (16 December 1911) battalions. When the unexpected Turkish resistance caused an embarrassingly slow advance of the Italian forces, reinforcements were sent to Libya. On October 18, 1912 Turkey and Italy signed the Treaty of Lausanne, which ended the war between the two nations. Italy, however, had now to face a full-scale rebellion by the local population, and required more troops than those deployed in combat to suppress it. Therefore, in October 1912 the Tolmezzo, Feltre, Susa, and Vestone battalions were deployed in Zanzur, Libya, and formed the 8th Special Alpini Regiment (Italian: \"8° Reggimento Alpini Speciale\") under the command of Colonel Antonio Cantore. The last Alpini unit to leave Libya was the \"Feltre\" battalion. It reached Italy in August 1914, while the Bedouin rebellion in Libya continued unabated.\n\nDuring World War I the 26 peacetime \"Alpini\" battalions were increased by 62 battalions and saw heavy combat all over the alpine arch. During the war years the \"Alpini\" regiments consisted of the following battalions (the pre-war raised battalions are in bold; their reserve battalions, named after valleys (in Italian: \"Val\" or \"Valle\"), and the newly raised battalions, named after mountains (in Italian: \"Monte\") drawn from the same recruiting areas as the original battalions follow below the pre-war battalions):\n\nThe Alpini battalions fielded 264 companies of one captain, four lieutenants and 250 men each. The Alpini regiments were never sent into battle, but remained at their seats to continue training recruits. The Alpini battalions were grouped together in regiment-sized Groups (\"Gruppo\"), and the groups were attached to brigade-sized Groupings (\"Raggruppamento\"), which deployed the Alpini battalions as needed.\n\nThe war, today known as the \"War in snow and ice\", as most of the 600 km frontline ran through mountains and glaciers of the Alps. 12 meters (40 feet) of snow were a usual occurrence during the winter of 1915/16 and thousands of soldiers were lost in avalanches. The remains of these soldiers are still being uncovered today. The Alpini, as well as their Austrian counterparts: Kaiserschützen, Standschützen and Landeschützen occupied every hill and mountain top around the whole year. Huge underground bases were drilled and dug into the mountainsides and into the ice of glaciers such as the Marmolada. Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Roads, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built up, through and along the steepest of cliffs. Many of these walkways and roads are still visible today, and many are maintained as Via Ferrata for climbing enthusiasts. In addition, along the former frontline it is still possible to see what is left of hundreds of kilometers of barbed wire.\n\nIn this kind of warfare, whoever occupied the higher ground first was almost impossible to dislodge, so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks, filling them up with explosives and then detonated the summits, including its defenders, to pieces: i.e. Col di Lana, Monte Pasubio, Lagazuoi, etc.\n\nClimbing and skiing became essential skills for the troops of both sides and soon ski battalions and special climbing units were formed. It was during these years that the Alpini, their spirit and their deeds became famous. Most of the Alpini songs originated during this time and reflect upon the hardships of the \"War in Snow and Ice\".\n\nAt the war's end the Alpini counted 114,948 casualties: 14,175 KIA, 61,620 WIA, 39,153 MIA (most lost in avalanches or to mine warfare).\n\nAfter World War I all battalions with the exception of the pre-war battalions were dissolved. In 1919 the Alpini gained the 9th Alpini Regiment. In 1935 the fascist government of Italy reorganized its Armed Forces, creating five Alpine divisions and forming a new Alpini regiment: the 11th Alpini Regiment. A 12th Alpini Regiment was also formed to oversee the battalions of the 9th Alpini Regiment, which were not sent with the regimental command and the 5 Alpine Division Pusteria to fight in the Italian attack on Abyssinia. After the return of the 7th Regiment, the 12 Alpini regiment was dissolved. In 1941 the 6th Alpine Division Alpi Graie was raised with reserve units of the other five Alpine divisions.\n\nThus Italy fielded the following six alpine divisions during World War II:\n\nEach division consisted of two Alpini regiments with three battalions each, one Alpine Artillery Regiment with three Artillery groups, one Mixed Engineer Battalion, one Logistic Battalion and some support units. The strength of each division was 573 officers and 16,887 NCOs and soldiers for a total strength of 17,460 men. Also each division had almost 5,000 mules and 500 vehicles of various types at its disposal.\nThe divisions saw combat in France, Africa, Italy, Albania, The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Greece. One Alpini battalion was employed in East Africa. In 1942, Tridentina, Julia and Cuneense division were sent to fight in the Soviet Union. In Russia, instead of being deployed in the Caucasus mountains as expected, the Alpini were tasked with holding a front on the plains of the Don River. As a result of this disastrous strategic decision, troops armed, trained, and equipped for mountain warfare were pitted in the plains against tanks and mechanized infantry, to counter which they were neither equipped nor trained. Despite this, the Alpini held the front until January 1943, when, due to the collapse of the Axis front, they were encircled by the advancing Soviet Army. The Alpini were able to break the encirclement in Battle of Nikolayevka and fight their way towards the new line of the front established after the Axis retreat. Only about one third of the Tridentina division (4250 survivors of 15,000 troops deployed) and one tenth of the Julia (1,200/15,000) were able to survive this odyssey. The Cuneense division was annihilated.\n\nAfter the Armistice of Cassibile between the Kingdom of Italy and Western Allies became public on 8 September 1943, Italy split in half. The king went to the South of Italy and left the Royal Italian Army without any orders. Subsequently, most divisions of the Army surrendered without a fight to the invading German forces. The only Alpini division to resist the Germans was the 1st Alpine Division \"Taurinense\", which along with the 19th Infantry Division \"Venezia\" and remnants of the 155th Infantry Division \"Emilia\" resisted German attempts to occupy Montenegro. After suffering heavy casualties the divisions troops were given the choice to either surrender or to retreat into the Durmitor mountains and continue the fight. The 16,000 men, who had chosen to fight, formed then the Italian Partisan Division \"Garibaldi\", which entered the II Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans and fought on the Yugoslav Front until it returned to Italy in March 1945.\n\nOn June 25, 1944, the 3rd Alpini Regiment was recreated in Southern Italy with the battalions \"Piemonte\" and \"Monte Granero\". Along with the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment it formed the 1st Italian Brigade of the Italian Liberation Corps, which fought in the war on the Allied side. After the Bersaglieri regiment had suffered heavy casualties the two regiments were merged on 30 September 1944 to form the Special Infantry Regiment, which entered the \"Legnano\" Combat Group. The Combat Group was equipped with British weapons and materiel and fought as part of the Polish II Corps on the extreme left of the British 8th Army near the river Idice.\n\nIn the north a fascist regime under dictator Benito Mussolini, known as the Republic of Salò continued the war alongside the Germans. Its Army, the fascist National Republican Army, raised the 4th Alpini Division \"Monte Rosa\", which was trained and equipped by Nazi Germany. The division fought along the Gothic Line, notably against units of Brazilian Expeditionary Division, U.S. 92nd Infantry Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division. At the end of the final allied offensive, the division surrendered after the Battle of Collecchio.\n\nAfter World War II the Alpini units were once more tasked with defending Italy's northern borders. On 15 October 1949 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade \"Julia\" was activated in Udine; on 1 May 1951 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade \"Tridentina\" was activated in Brixen; on 15 April 1952 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade \"Taurinense\" was activated in Turin; on 1 January 1953 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade \"Orobica\" was activated in Meran and on 1 July 1953 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade \"Cadore\" was activated in Belluno. Each brigade recruited its soldiers from specific parts of the mountainous areas of Italy thus creating a strong bond with the local populations. But only in 1972 when the \"Taurinense\" joined the IV Army Corps all Alpini, Alpine and Mountain units of the Italian Army were finally under one command.\n\n\nAfter the 1976 reform the IV Alpine Army Corps was responsible to defend the Italian border along the main chain of the alps from the Swiss-Austrian-Italian border tripoint in the west to the Italian-Yugoslavian border in the east. In case of war with Yugoslavia the IV Alpine Army Corps would remain static in its position guarding the left flank of the Italian V Corps, which would meet the enemy forces in the plains of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The only brigade which would have seen combat in such a case would have been the \"Julia\".\n\nIn case of a war with the Warsaw Pact the IV Alpine Army Corps had two war plans: one in the case the Soviet Southern Group of Forces and Hungarian Army would march through Yugoslavia and the other in case the Warsaw Pact would violate the Austrian neutrality and march through Austria. In case the enemy forces would come through Yugoslavia, the Julia would cover the mountainous left flank of the 5th Corps, which with its four armoured and five mechanized brigades would try to wear down the enemy before it could break out into the North Italian Padan plain. The other Alpini brigades would remain static.\n\nIn the more likely case the Soviet and Hungarian divisions would invade Austria and march through Southern Styria and through the Drava valley in Carinthia the Alpini brigades would have been the first front line units of the Italian Army: the \"Julia\" would have defended the Canal valley, the \"Cadore\" would have defended the Piave valley and the \"Tridentina\" the Puster valley, while the \"Orobica\" had a special mission and the \"Taurinense\" would remain in reserve.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, all but the Julia and Taurinense Brigades were dissolved, thus leaving the following Alpini units, that still carry the \"fiamme verdi\" collar insignia:\n\n\nCurrently an Alpino is equipped with a Beretta ARX 160 assault rifle, usually fitted with an Aimpoint M3 Reddot, a Beretta 92 FS pistol, OD/82SE hand grenades, a Type III AP/98 (they are now slowly being provided with the newest NC4/09 bulletproof vest, phasing out the AP/98) bullet-proof vest and a 3rd generation night vision device.\n\nThe squad automatic weapon is the FN Minimi or, alternatively, the Rheinmetall MG3.\nSupporting fire can be provided also by M2 Browning (0.50\") machine gun, the Hirtenberger M6C-210 Commando 60 mm, man-portable light mortar or by the MO-120-RT-61 120 mm heavy mortar.\n\nMobility is provided by the use of Iveco VTLM Lince 4WD tactical vehicles, Puma 6x6 Armored Personal Carriers and Bv 206 / Bv 206S all terrain tracked vehicles.\n\nThe anti-tank weapons are the Panzerfaust 3 rocket propelled grenade and the MILAN 2 and TOW II anti-tank guided missiles. The later two will be replaced by the Spike anti-tank guided missile over the next years.\n\nIn 1999 the artillery regiments have been issued with the FH-70 howitzer. This has led to a great increase in firepower compared to the previously used OTO Melara Mod 56 pack howitzer, but also reduced their versatility. Indeed, they are not designated now as \"mountain artillery\", but as \"Field Artillery (Mountain)\" regiments.\n\nCurrently the Alpini are being provided with a small number of ARX-160 rifles to field-test the designated standard rifle of the Italian Army in harsh and cold environments.\n\nThe Alpini share the ranks of the Italian Army but have an additional rank insignia on their Cappello Alpino uniform. All enlisted personnel and junior non-commissioned officers wear no insignia, only officers and senior NCOs wear them and special rank insignia are used by them in the form of chevrons increasing by rank until the rank of Colonel and by silver collar ribbons by general officers.\n\n\" Enlisted and Junior NCOs – No Insignia\"\n\n\"Senior NCOs\"\n\n\"Junior and Field Officers\"\n\n\"General Officers\"\n\nThe ANA (Associazione Nazionale Alpini or National Alpini Association) is a registered society representing the \"Veci\" or former members of the Alpini corps. As the \"Veci\" see themselves as merely \"on leave\" rather than veterans, the ANA is colloquially known to be the 10th Alpini Regiment. Since 1920 every year ANA organizes a national reunion the \"Veci\". Hundreds of thousands of Alpini congregate with family and friends to an Italian city for a weekend in the late spring to celebrate and have a good time while remembering old times.\nThe strong spirit of cooperation typical for mountain peoples in the Alps, drives ANA to be not only a recreational association but a strongly involved one in Protezione Civile, alerted during natural disasters.\n\nThe Alpini Hymn \"L'Inno degli Alpini\" or \"Trentatrè - valore Alpino\" is the official hymn of the Alpini Corps, adapted from an old French mountain song by D'Estel and Travel. As the official anthem of the corps it forms part of the various songs and marches played by the Corps' military bands on parades and concerts, in the latter, the second to the last song to be played before the Italian National Anthem.\n<br>\nI<br>\nDai fidi tetti del villaggio i bravi alpini son partiti,mostran la forza ed il coraggio della lor salda gioventù.\n\nSon dell'Alpe i bei cadetti, nella robusta giovinezzadai loro baldi e forti petti spira un'indomita fierezza.\n\nChorus (2x)<br>\n\"Oh valore alpin! Difendi sempre la frontiera!E là sul confin tien sempre alta la bandiera.\"\n\n\"Sentinella all'erta per il suol nostro italianodove amor sorride e più benigno irradia il sol.\"\n\nII<br>\nLà tra le selve ed i burroni, là tra le nebbie fredde e il gelo,piantan con forza i lor picconi le vie rendon più brevi.\n\nE quando il sole brucia e scalda le cime e le profondità, il fiero Alpino scruta e guarda, pronto a dare il \"Chi va là?\"\n\n\"Repeat Chorus 2x\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The spiral makes use of local geography in the shape of a convenient hill which the uphill ('up', or Sydney-bound) track spirals around in order to gain the necessary height over a longer distance, thus giving a lesser gradient. However the fact that the hill is on the 'down' (southbound) side of the original track necessitated two crossings of the original line by the new northbound track - one to take it to the eastern (or 'down') side of the original track in order to then spiral around the hill, and a second to take it back to the left hand side of the original line (Australian trains run on the left, as in the UK, France and Japan). The Spiral has two short tunnels - one at the beginning of the Spiral, for the 'up' track to cross beneath the original line to reach the 'down' side, and a second tunnel which allows it to pass over itself at a later point in the Spiral, having circled the hill to gain height.\n\nThe spiral increased the distance travelled by uphill (northbound) trains by about two kilometres. Downhill (southbound) trains continue to use the original line. The ruling gradient of the new uphill line is 1 in 66.\n\nDue to the extensive blasting required to create 27 metre deep cuttings through granite, the line suffers from rockfalls, with twelve significant falls between 1960 and 1987. In January 1994, the spiral line closed for a four-month rebuild which saw the cuttings widened and regraded to benched 55 degree slopes, as part of the One Nation project.\n\nThe Bethungra Spiral is of high significance, illustrating a means of ascending a significant mountain range with easier grades than the original line (now the 'down' track). It is a major civil work and an ingenious engineering solution using the technology available at the time of construction. The site has major landscape value.\n\nBethungra Spiral was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria:\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\nThis item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare.\n\nStarting at the lower left corner of the interactive map, the 'up' track to Cootamundra (and thence to Sydney) is the one on the left. It diverges from the 'down' track and has been built at a less steep gradient than the 'down' track and so is able to pass under it (through a tunnel) then sweeping around the hill (passing through the second tunnel in the process), gaining elevation all the while until crossing over itself above the second tunnel. It is now higher than the down track and on its right (if northbound), and at an overpass further north (click on \"Full screen\" to view), crosses back over to the left and eventually the two tracks converge just short of the Olympic Highway level crossing.\n\nThe route of the proposed Inland Railway entails a new section of line from Illabo, west of Bethungra, to Stockinbingal, to obviate the need for northbound trains on the Inland Railway to climb the Bethungra Spiral to Cootamundra then drop down to Stockinbingal to continue north towards Forbes then Parkes. It is projected that this section of the Inland Railway will be completed by 2025. The Spiral will remain in use as part of the Melbourne-Sydney line.\n\nA traveller who has just passed through Bethungra township on the way to Cootamundra would be unaware of the existence nearby of the Bethungra Spiral, to the right of the Olympic Highway, as there is no signage or safe off-road parking to observe the two tracks at three different elevations. However there is a point at which three railway tracks can be seen at three different heights on the adjacent hillside to the east of the Olympic Highway. The bottom and top tracks are the 'up' (northbound) track before and after it has crossed the 'down' (southbound) track and traversed the Spiral, while the middle track is the original single-track line, which is now the 'down' (southbound) track.\n\n"}

It is modelled on the equivalent commands in the United States and British military forces, and is led by a major general as Special Operations Commander Australia (SOCAUST).\n\nThe origins of SOCOMD began in 1979 with the army creating a small Directorate Special Action Forces—Army. On 13 February 1990, Headquarters Special Forces was established, which was renamed in 1997 to Headquarters Special Operations and in 2003 to Special Operations Headquarters or SOCOMD.\n\n\nWhile Special Operations Command had not formally commenced operations at the time, it appears that the headquarters may have overseen the boarding of the North Korean freighter MV \"Pong Su\" in April 2003, which involved elements of both the Special Air Service Regiment and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) Tactical Assault Groups.\n\nIn November 2018, the 30th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting held in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea had Special Operations Command involvement to enhance the Papua New Guinea Defence Force's Incident Response Group to provide security as world leaders, including Scott Morrison, Mike Pence, Xi Jinping, Dmitry Medvedev and other government and economic leaders were in attendance.

{"id": "1999242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999242", "title": "Labour council", "text": "Labour council\n\nA labour council, trades council or industrial council is an association of labour unions or union branches in a given area. Most commonly, they represent unions in a given geographical area, whether at the district, city, region, or provincial or state level. They may also be based on a particular industry rather than geographical area, as for example, in the \"Maritime Council of Australia\" which co-ordinated the waterfront and maritime unions involved in the 1890 Australian Maritime Dispute.\n\nAffiliates of labour councils are trade union branches or locals, and occasionally other labour movement organisations. Citywide or provincial councils may have district or regional labour council affiliates as well as trade unions. Some labour councils restrict their membership to organisations which are affiliated with a particular national trade union federation, such as many state-level labour councils in the United States, which are chartered from the AFL-CIO national confederation.\n\nFinances are usually obtained through an affiliation fee, often based on a per capita tax on the membership of affiliates. In Australia, \"Trades and Labour Councils\" often have their own hall and offices known as a Trades Hall, with the term \"Trades Hall\" often used as a colloquial expression for the \"Labour Council\" or \"Trades Hall Council\".\n\nLabour councils are a widespread phenomenon, but are given different names in different English-speaking areas. \"Labour Council\" is most common in Canada and Australia, \"Labor Council\" is used in the (USA) and \"Trades Council\", \"Trades Union Council\" or \"Trades and Labour Council\" in the United Kingdom (and until recently was widespread in Australia) and some other countries. Another term sometimes used is \"Industrial Council\", as in for example, the Barrier Industrial Council of Broken Hill in Australia.\n\nNational associations of trade unions, such as British Trade Union Congress may also be considered a labour council, though the term often implies a primarily local organisation.\n\n\"Labour Councils\" were formed to meet a need to co-ordinate trade union activity in a geographical region. The earliest examples of this form of organisation can be found in the medieval craft guilds and Craft halls that developed in European cities. An example of this is the historic Glasgow Trades Hall wherein the 14 Incorporated Trades of Hammermen, Tailors, Cordiners, Maltmen, Weavers, Bakers, Skinners, Wrights, Coopers, Fleshers, Masons, Gardeners, Barbers, Bonnetmakers & Dyers yearly elected members of the Trades House, headed by the Deacon Convener of the Trades:\n\nThe trade union activity of the late nineteenth century in particular spurred the establishment of Labour Councils and Trades Councils acrossing North America, Australia and Britain.\n\nSome notable events in the history of \"labour councils\" include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999243", "title": "Unison, Virginia", "text": "Unison, Virginia\n\nUnison is an unincorporated community village in Loudoun County, Virginia. It is located approximately five miles from Middleburg in the Loudoun Valley close to the Fauquier County border.\n\nFounded in about 1740 by Quakers who had migrated down from Pennsylvania, via Maryland and across the Potomac to the fertile farmlands of Northern Virginia, the village and its surrounds - later to become known as Union, and then Unison - was referred to as \"Greenland\" or \"Butterland\" in early 1800's deeds. The name \"Butterland\" was said to have come about as a nod to the Royal taxes at the time being collected in pounds of butter, rather than coin.\nIn 1813 Virginia's General Assembly chartered the village as the Town of Union. That same year the federal government established the Union Post Office, discontinued twice in its early years, from 1820-1824, and in 1828. The post office was reestablished in 1829 under Union's new name of Unison which was forced on the town largely because Monroe Court House in Monroe County, Virginia had taken the name Union a few years prior, even though its own post office had been established 4 years after Loudoun's Union post office. Unfortunately for Loudoun's Union, Monroe County got preferred treatment because their courthouse was situated in their town of Union.\n\nBy the 1830s Unison was the 4th largest town in Loudoun County. Yardley Taylor, writing for Joseph Martin's Gazetteer of Virginia in 1835, used the old name \"Union\" to identify Unison and counted 25 dwellings, 3 houses of worship, a school, 2 general stores, a blacksmith, and a tavern. Among the 135 inhabitants there were a number of professionals including a lawyer and 3 physicians.\n\nAs the prospect of a civil war loomed on the horizon at the opening of the 1860s, the last vote of the Unison Precinct on May 23, 1861 - a count to affirm Virginia's secession from the Federal Union - was 150-0, the largest shutout vote for secession in the county. All the Quaker pacifists had remained home during the voting, so their voices against secession remained silent.\n\nBetween October 31 and November 2, 1862, the village was the scene of a several skirmishes between Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart and Union cavalry, infantry and artillery in what is now known as the Battle of Unison. Because Stuart's delaying tactics at Unison cost the Federals time, a major portion of Lee's force had crossed the Blue Ridge, reached Culpeper and now had time to regroup and prepare for the next major encounter between the two sides at Fredericksburg. Lee's army and his capital were saved. On November 5, 1862, the New York Times correspondent reported \"Stuart . . . balked what might have been a splendid success\".\n\nAfter the war Unison remained Loudoun County's 4th largest town for only a few more years. By the late 1870s towns along the railroad line running through western Loudoun County, which missed Unison by 8 miles, saw their populations boom, and soon outstripped Unison in both commercial and population importance. Unison's post office remained until 1919 when the mails were discontinued to the town, the post office was closed, and mail delivery moved to the post office in nearby town of Round Hill which was served by the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. However, even into the middle of the 20th century, Unison maintained itself as a viable town with its own churches, general store, and a saddle shop, and even a baseball team that played in the Loudoun baseball leagues. By the 1980s the town had been in decline, too far away from the new highways that now carried the bulk of Loudoun's commerce and population. By the 1990s the town had become little more than a sleepy residential enclave with only 50 permanent residences and 14 or so houses. The last retail enterprise, the Unison Store, a general store that had been in continuous business since 1880, closed in August 1996.\n\nIn 2001 the vacant Unison Store building was being considered by a buyer as a tear down. This news prompted a local gathering of residents to attempt to save the building. They formed a 501[c]3 non-profit group, incorporated as \"The Unison Preservation Society\", their stated goal to help protect and preserve the historic village and surrounding countryside of Unison. As a result of their efforts Unison was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in 2002 as the Unison Historic District, and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The store was purchased at highest bid by a local business at a public auction in 2001, and the building subsequently renovated. It was used as an office business until April 2013 when the building was again sold. It was purchased this time by a local philanthropist, Dr. Betsee Parker, owner of Huntlands, who then gifted the building to the Unison Preservation Society. The old Unison Store is now a community center, serving the village and the surrounding area.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2011, due to the successful efforts of the Unison Preservation Society's research and documentation into the important historical significance of the battles and skirmishes that took place in and around the Unison area, Virginia added further buildings and acreage to the Virginia Landmarks register and nominated the 8,000-acre Unison Battlefield Historic District for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe population count of Unison is now about 30, greatly outnumbered by the horses in the surrounding farms. The village contains a single United Methodist Church, and a number of private home businesses.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999248", "title": "Brad May", "text": "Brad May\n\nBradley Scott May (born November 29, 1971) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). In the 2006–07 season he won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Anaheim Ducks. He currently works with the Vegas Golden Knights broadcast team and as an NHL analyst with AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain. May was born in Toronto, Ontario, but grew up in Markham, Ontario.\n\nMay was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres, 14th overall, in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. While not a \nprolific scorer, May contributed to Sabres history in his second full season with the team. In Game 4 of the opening round of the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Boston Bruins, the teams were tied at 5 and required overtime to decide a winner. May took a pass from a falling Pat LaFontaine at center ice, deked past Ray Bourque, then went on goal where he faked out Andy Moog, which caused him to fall and leave an open space for May to score on a wrist shot. The goal not only won the game but secured Buffalo's upset of the second-best team in the NHL. The goal is referred to informally as the \"Mayday goal\", thanks to the following call from Sabres voice Rick Jeanneret:\n\nHe was later traded by the Sabres to the Vancouver Canucks for forward Geoff Sanderson on February 5, 1998.\n\nAfter sitting out during the 2004–05 NHL Lockout, May signed with the Colorado Avalanche as an unrestricted free agent for two years on August 20, 2005. May's signing caused much conjecture and debate in Colorado due to his role played in the previous season's Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore incident as a Vancouver Canuck. He was later traded on February 27, 2007 to the Anaheim Ducks for goaltender Michael Wall. The Ducks went on to win the Stanley Cup that year, and May had his name engraved on the Cup for the first time in his career.\n\nOn July 4, 2007, May re-signed as a free agent with Anaheim for a further two years. In the 2007–08 season, May played his 900th career NHL game on November 16, 2007 and scoring his 125th career goal as the Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings 6-3. May was selected during the year to ride on Anaheim city's float at the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade to accompany and parade the Stanley Cup.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season on January 7, 2009, May was traded from the Ducks to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a conditional 6th round draft pick in 2010. On April 8, 2009 May played in his 1,000th career NHL game against the Buffalo Sabres. It was no coincidence that the milestone came against the Buffalo Sabres, as he was purposely sat out for the previous game.\n\nOn September 23, 2009, May was invited to try out for the Detroit Red Wings, reuniting temporarily with former Vancouver teammates Todd Bertuzzi and Dan Cloutier. May made his Red Wings debut in a pre-season game on September 25, 2009. At the start of the 2009–10 season on October 8, 2009, May then signed a one-year contract with the Red Wings. After posting 2 assists in 40 games with Red Wings May was put on waiver to clear roster room for Andreas Lilja on February 12, 2010. After clearing waivers and briefly contemplating possible retirement May decided to report to Wings AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, to play out the season. In an expanded role with the Griffins May scored 10 points in 17 games before he was returned to Detroit as a part of the extended squad for the playoffs.\n\nOn September 20, 2010, without an offer of a new contract, May effectively announced his retirement in accepting a position as a CBC American Hockey League analyst.\nFollowing the retirement of longtime Buffalo Sabres analyst Mike Robitaille after the 2013-14 season, May joined the Sabres broadcast crew on a limited basis before moving into Robitaille's slot in a full-time role for the NHL 2014-15 season. May was replaced on Sabres broadcasts by Martin Biron following the 2016-2017 season.\nBeginning with the 2017-2018 season, May serves as an analyst for the Vegas Golden Knights with AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain.\n\nAs a member of the Phoenix Coyotes on November 11, 2000, May was suspended for 20 games for slashing Columbus Blue Jackets forward Steve Heinze in the nose with his stick. Heinze would need nine stitches, but returned to ice quickly. After the game, May apologized to Heinze, who accepted the apology.

He was consequently sued by the police officer and in December 2005, was ordered to pay damages from a civil jury.\n\nMay was also noted for allegedly putting the bounty on the head of the Colorado Avalanche's Steve Moore that ultimately resulted in the Todd Bertuzzi incident that essentially ended Moore's career. May was named in a lawsuit filed by Moore, but unable to prove conspiracy theories, charges were later dropped in Colorado as the case was moved to a Canadian court.\n\nMay was suspended for three games in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs for punching Minnesota Wild defenceman Kim Johnsson in the face during the final minutes of Game Four between the Ducks and Wild. Both teams were involved in a large scrum of fighting, pushing, and shoving. May turned around and without warning punched Johnsson, who was skating towards the scrum. Johnsson was knocked unconscious for a short amount of time. Johnsson was not seriously injured, but was hospitalized, and missed Game Five of the series. The Ducks would win that game and eliminate the Wild from the Playoffs. In an interview, May said that he intended to contact Johnsson to apologize and explain what happened.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999251", "title": "Simplesse", "text": "Simplesse\n\nSimplesse is a multi-functional dairy ingredient made from whey protein concentrate used as a fat substitute in low-calorie foods. Originally brought to market in 1988, the manufacturer, CP Kelco (a former NutraSweet subsidiary), sells Simplesse to food processors as a \"microparticulated whey protein concentrate\" in dry powder form, and recommends that it be labelled as dairy protein on food labels. Older versions of the product also contain egg whites.\n\nThe protein is partially coagulated by heat, creating a micro dispersion, in a process known as microparticulation. It is due to the small particle size of the protein that the dispersion is perceivable as a fluid with similar creaminess and richness of fat.\nSimplesse began in 1979 as \"a substance that gelled like egg white but crumbled like Styrofoam.\" At that time, Shoji Yamamoto, an associate of Norman S. Singer at Canadian beer company John Labatt Ltd. in London, Ontario, brought Singer the whey protein substance. After sensing that it gave the taste texture of cream cheese, another scientist put a sample under a powerful microscope and saw \"tiny spheres of protein rolling over each other\" about a tenth the size of particles of powdered sugar. It was this particle rolling action that gave a smooth creaminess sensation. Another associate of Singer, scientist Nina Davis, worked for three years with Simplesse (then called microcurd) to adapt it to and incorporate it into many different food products. After Singer's boss observed that the product tasted like cheesecake, Singer filed for and received a United States patent for his efforts with the product. Labatt licensed the product to NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Creve Coeur, Missouri, United States chemical conglomerate Monsanto, in 1984. The product was given the trademark \"Simplesse\" in January 1988. An initial version of the product, approved for use in frozen desserts like low-fat ice cream substitutes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was introduced to the public about that same time as being \"the first completely natural fat substitute.\" The FDA approved a second version of the product in 1991 for use in salad dressings, butter, and baked goods.\n\nSimplesse is a protein-based fat substitute derived from milk proteins that allows calorie reductions of up to 80 percent compared with foods that contain fat. Described in a United States patent abstract as \"a proteinaceous, water-dispersible, macrocolloid comprising substantially non-aggregated particles of dairy whey protein,\" Simplesse particles are so minute that a person's tongue perceives the texture of the substitute as being smooth and creamy. Its texture is due to its ability to form a colloid, similar to the way fat is dispersed in homogenized milk. It differs from other whey protein concentrate mainly by virtue of the principles of food rheology; it is produced by a mechanical, rather than a chemical process. However, when heated such as by frying, the ingredients in the faux fat begin to gel similar to egg whites so the product mostly is used in ice cream, butter, spread cheeses, sour cream and dips, oil-based products such as salad dressings and mayonnaise, and other products that do not involve cooking.\n\nSimplesse is used in ice cream, yogurt, cheese spread, salad dressings, margarine, mayonnaise, coffee creamer, soups, and sauces.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the common name of Simplesse for use in the list of ingredients of a food depends on the form of Simplesse used in the final product. If the Simplesse is made from egg white and milk protein, then the common name must appear in the list of ingredients as \"egg and milk protein\". The trade name \"Simplesse\" may appear in brackets following \"egg and milk protein\". An earlier suggested common name \"microparticulated protein\" is no longer required. If Simplesse is actually \"whey protein concentrate\", it may be described as either \"whey protein concentrate\" or \"modified milk ingredient\" (section B.01.010 (3) (b) item 7.1, of the Food and Drug Regulations) in the list of ingredients. In either case, the trade name \"Simplesse\" may appear in brackets following it. (09/MA/90; 20/MR/92; 06/NO/92; MA 25/94.) Date modified: 2012-09-21\n\nSimplesse is digested as a protein, but due to the micro dispersion formed, it produces only 1.0 to 1.3 Cal/g as opposed to 9.0 Cal/g that produces regular fat. Consuming Simplesse gives the possibility of maintaining the rich texture of the product by avoiding the high calorie intake. Simplesse allows the consumer to feel satiety just as consuming a regular fat.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999259", "title": "Bank engine", "text": "Bank engine\n\nA bank engine (United Kingdom/Australia) (colloquially a banker), banking engine, helper engine or pusher engine (North America) is a railway locomotive that temporarily assists a train that requires additional power or traction to climb a gradient (or \"bank\"). Helpers/bankers are most commonly found in mountain divisions (called \"helper districts\" in the US), where the ruling grade may demand the use of substantially greater motive power than that required for other grades within the division.\n\nHelpers/bankers were most widely used during the age of steam, especially in the American West, where significant grades are common and trains are long. The development of advanced braking systems and diesel-electric or electric locomotives has eliminated the everyday need for bankers/helpers in all but a few locations. With the advent of dynamic brakes on electric or diesel-electric locomotives, helpers/bankers can also be used to provide more braking force on long downhill gradients.\n\nBankers or helpers were historically positioned at the rear of the train, in which case they also protected against wagons or coaches breaking away from the train and running back downhill. Also, in a pusher role, it was possible for the helper/banker to easily separate once the train had crested the grade. Once separated, the banker would return to a siding or stub so as to clear the mainline and get ready for the next train. A common practice with knuckle couplers was to remove the knuckle from the front coupler. The locomotive would be brought up behind the last car of the train while the train was moving slowly. The air brake hose would not be coupled. When the train no longer required assistance, the helper/pusher would slow, then reverse and coast back down the grade to its siding at the bottom of the grade. This practice was outlawed in North America after the end of the steam era.\n\nSpecial heavily constructed cabooses were sometimes used in helper areas. Ordinary cabooses were built as lightly as practical and might be crushed by the helper/pusher's force, which could be as much as 90 tons. The heavy cabooses allowed crews to avoid the time-consuming procedure of splitting the train just ahead of the caboose.\n\nPushers/helpers were commonly designed to provide extreme power for very short runs; as a result they could not push at full power for very far before steam pressure dropped. But if it could push enough to get the train to the top of the grade, then it could build up pressure while coasting back down and while waiting for the next train to come along. This practice was common in Europe.\n\nSince it was not possible to remotely control a steam locomotive, each helper had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a pusher locomotive crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive applied brakes while the bank engine was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train.\n\nThe town of Helper, Utah was named after these engines, as it was where helper engines were kept to assist on the climb to Soldier Summit.\n\nNowadays helpers/bankers are often controlled by coded radio signals from the locomotive at the head end of the train, allowing one engineer (driver) to simultaneously control the helper(s) and the train being helped. If radio operation is not possible, electrical control might be used, by way of cables running the length of the train (especially in case of passenger trains), or else the helpers are manually controlled, which is still the norm for bank engines at the end of freight trains in Europe.\n\nIn the UK, an engine that was temporarily attached to the front of a train to assist with the ascent of an incline was called a \"pilot locomotive\". This differentiated it from the \"train engine(s)\" which was provided to power the train to its destination. A train with one or more helper locomotives attached to the front may be referred to as a \"double header\", \"triple header\", etc., depending on the number of helpers/bankers. These terms gradually fell out of general usage as diesel locomotives replaced steam power.\n\nIn countries where buffers-and-chain couplers are used, bank engines often cannot be added to the front of the train due to the limited strength of the couplers; In the case of standard UIC couplers and a maximum grade of 28‰ (which is common e.g. for lines through the Alps), the limit is a train weight of 1400 tons; if a train is heavier, bank engines have to be added in the middle or to the end of the train in order not to exceed the maximum load for any coupler.\n\nAdding locomotives in the middle of the train has the distinct advantage of applying the helper power to only part of the train, thus limiting the maximum drawbar pull applied to the first car of the train to a safe level. The narrow gauge portions of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, in particular, used \"swing helpers\", which meant the helper locomotives were placed mid-train at a point where they were pushing and pulling an approximately equal amount of tonnage, said location being referred to as the train's \"swing point\". This was also done to balance out the \"slack\" in the train between the locomotives, the swing helpers, and the end train helpers just in front of the caboose. However, this arrangement requires splitting the train in order to add or remove the helper engine(s), which can be a time-consuming maneuver. However, on some American railroads it was necessary to an extent because operating rules required end of train helpers to be added at the end of the train, but in front of the caboose. This was done for the safety of the train crew riding inside the caboose.\n\nTo be able to add and remove helper locomotives quickly, which is especially important in Europe due to the high traffic density, they are usually added to the end of the train. Normally they are coupled and the air hoses are connected, which is necessary for the air brake to work correctly e.g. in emergency situations, but in special cases trains are banked with uncoupled locomotives, which can be added or removed \"in-flight.\" In the UK it was a usual practice for banking locomotives to follow and buffer-up to a slow-moving assisted freight train without coupling (as demonstrated in archive films of banking on the Lickey Incline) before applying more power, thus avoiding a standing start. Following an accident in 1969 this practice was discontinued. This procedure is not performed in North America as it would violate Canadian and US safety regulations.\n\nThe following are locations where bankers are, or were, frequently required. Note that different regions of the world express grades differently, commonly used are ‰ (per mill), % (per cent), or a fractional ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Bavarian Railways developed special 0-8-8-0 mallet banking locomotives: series Gt 2×4/4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteam banking engines used included the NZR Wj class of 1904 and NZR E class (1906). \n\nBanking by diesel-electric locomotives is also used on all steam train excursions that travel between Tauranga and Matamata on the East Coast Main Trunk, Featherston and Upper Hutt on the Wairarapa Line, and Arthur's Pass and Otira on the Midland Line. This is due to steam operation being too dangerous within the confinements of long tunnels on those sections of line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The play is the first drama to win both the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. The play opened on Broadway in 1939.\n\n\n\n\nThe play is set in Nick's Pacific Street Saloon, Restaurant and Entertainment Palace, a run down dive bar in San Francisco. Much of the action of the play centers around Joe, a young loafer with money who encourages each of the bar's patrons in their eccentricities. Joe helps out a would-be dancer, Harry, and sets up his flunky, Tom, with a prostitute, Kitty Duval. The bar is frequented by a number of colorful characters, including a frenetic young man in love, an old man who looks like Kit Carson, and an affluent society couple.\n\nNick's saloon is based on the café operated by Izzy Gomez in San Francisco, which Saroyan frequented.\n\nThe play was produced by the Theatre Guild. It premiered on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on October 25, 1939, closed on January 27, 1940, and re-opened at the Guild Theatre on January 29, 1940 to April 6, 1940 and September 23, 1940 to October 19, 1940, for 249 performances.

Operating in the Manhattan neighborhood east of the Bowery, the area between Houston and Fifth Streets was known as a \"pickpockets paradise\" to the local press. A common tactic of the gang was to stage a street fight and pickpocket the gathering crowd. A variation of this technique was to have several gang members pick a fight with a victim where he would be \"rescued\" by other gang members posing as innocent bystanders and have his pockets picked while being rushed through the crowd. \n\nHowever, when Anthony J. Allaire was appointed precinct captain in 1877, police \"flying squads\" were sent to clear the district attacking anyone who was suspected or resembled a pickpocket or other criminal and by the end of the year few members of the gang remained. \n\nThe same area would become home to another gang of mostly teenaged pickpockets, the Crazy Butch Gang in the late-1890s.\n\nOne of the founding members, \"Sheeny\" Mike Kurtz (or Mike Whelan) jointly ruled the gang along with Little Freddie and Johnny Irving during the 1870s. He was eventually imprisoned at Clinton Prison and sentenced to 18 years and 6 months on March 30, 1880 although he was possibly later released on appeal. He would later have a successful career as a bank robber and jewelry thief with Irving during the 1880s and 90s before his death in New York.\n\nIn 1894, Kurtz was arrested with \"Dutch\" Fred Ryder and ex-policeman Michael Malone in connection with the robbery of the Albert J. Knoll's Jersey Street saloon in Elizabethtown, New Jersey on April 2, 1894. The three burglars agreed to turn state's evidence against David McAdams, sportsman and manager of the Red Jacket Hotel, who they claimed arranged the robbery and hired them to rob the hotel in exchange for a percentage of the expected $800 in cash.\n\nJohnny Irving (b. 1844-1883) lead the gang along with Mike Kurtz and Little Freddie and had a successful burglary career with Billy Porter during the 1870s and 80s. \n\nIn August 1878, he and Porter were arrested on suspicion of robbing a Williamsburg dry goods store of $4,000 the previous month, however police were forced to release the two due to lack of evidence. After being under police surveillance, police were able to gain sufficient evidence after finding stolen silk and jewelry as well as burglar's tools and a combination safelock. \n\nShortly after his arrest, the recovered evidence was linked to a recent robbery of a local flour merchant who confirmed that torn up checks and a safe drawer found at Irving's home were those stolen from his store. \n\nThe following year, Irving and Porter escaped from Raymondstreet Jail after their arrest for the robbery of National Bank of Northampton. While Porter was arrested shortly after their escape, Irving remained on the run for almost six years until his arrest in Lawrence, Massachusetts on March 3, 1884. \n\nIrving was eventually killed by rival Johnny Walsh during a gunfight at a Sixth Avenue saloon owned by Thomas \"Shang\" Draper on October 19, 1883. Walsh was also killed during the gunfight. Porter was charged in his death, but acquitted.\n\n"}

Stephenson went to Ripon College and was active in campus drama. Stephenson wanted to be a lawyer and studied at the University of Wisconsin Law School. After serving in the United States Army Air Forces, as a gunner and radio operator, during World War II, John Stephenson graduated from Northwestern University with a master's degree in Speech and Drama in 1948. In 1946, during his studies, he gained an acting role on an episode of a drama radio series on WBKB.\n\nHe started his acting career in numerous television shows in the 1950s and into the 1970s, usually in guest star roles on such shows as:\n\n\nFrom 1955-58, he had a recurring role as Roger Crutcher on \"The People's Choice\".\n\nStephenson had a small part as a man from the State Department in the film \"Hellfighters\", starring John Wayne.\n\nStephenson provided the voice for commercials of the era, including spots for Peter Pan Peanut Butter featuring character actor Jesse White.\n\nFor several decades, he worked for Hanna-Barbera Productions, performing for many of its 1960s and 1970s animated television series. His first role for the company was for \"The Flintstones\"s eleventh episode, \"The Golf Champion\". He played The Golf Commentator, a lodge member and Left-Foot Charlie. Stephenson's first regular role for Hanna-Barbera was as Mr. Slate, Fred Flintstone's hard-edged boss at Slate Rock and Gravel Company.

For \"The Adventures of Gulliver\", he voiced the villain Captain Leech and the Lilliputian monarch, King Pomp; in the first episode of the series he also voiced Gulliver's father.\n\nStephenson was most often cast as curmudgeon and irascible characters. His range was limited but served him well in the roles he brought to prominence. In total, Stephenson had about five or six voices he would apply to characters.

Another character given that same vocal delivery was Chief Wiggins on the series \"Dynomutt, Dog Wonder\", Sheriff Bagley on \"Clue Club\", and countless others.\n\nAnother voice Stephenson was often called to do was the high nasal Joe Flynn-inspired voice. This voice was usually given to characters that were either rude, or smart-alecks, or flat out mean. They were also short-tempered; examples include Mr. Peevly from \"Help! It's the Hair Bear Bunch!\", Mr. Finkerton from \"Inch High Private Eye\", \"Schnooker\" from \"Inspector Mumbly\", a segment from \"The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show\" and Captain Snerdley from \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\"..\n\nHe was cast most often in the \"Scooby-Doo\" series as the villains or the red herring scientist. In the episode \"High Rise Hair Raiser\", he played Mr. Daugherty, Mr. Speck, and the villain of that episode, The Specter. Still, another voice Stephenson was noted for, was his take on Boris Karloff. A lot of the Karloff-sounding villains in early episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" were provided by Stephenson. He played Hairy Scary on \"Casper and the Angels\" along with \"Casper's Halloween Special\" and \"Casper's First Christmas\". He also played Farmer John Arable in the 1973 Hanna-Barbera animated feature \"Charlotte's Web\".\n\nJohn Stephenson borrowed the vocal traits of Joe Flynn for several characters as mentioned earlier, Boris Karloff for several more, and did a Jimmy Durante for the 1970s and 1980s version of \"Doggie Daddy\" on \"Yogi's Treasure Hunt\". Also, if needed, Stephenson has been known to do a take-off on Paul Lynde as heard on the 1977 series \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics\" as Mildew Wolf. Originally, Lynde voiced the character as part of a segment shown on a series called \"Cattanooga Cats\" but was not interested in reprising the role on \"Laff-a-Lympics\". Stephenson also gave voice to the Dread Baron, a re-designed Dick Dastardly character. A further Stephenson voice was used for the magician The Great Fondoo, inspired perhaps by Bela Lugosi. He also reached back for the Paul Lynde voice when he was cast as Wilfred Wolf in the early 1980s series, \"Kwicky Koala\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, he performed on various cartoons of the period such as \"\", \"The Smurfs\", \"Galaxy High\", \"\" and \"Bionic Six\". He voiced Huffer, Windcharger, Thundercracker, and Alpha Trion from the 1980s hit TV series \"The Transformers\", and took over the role of Kup for the show's third season (the character was voiced by Lionel Stander in \"\"). In 1987, he reprised Fancy-Fancy in \"Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats\" in which he also replaced Allen Jenkins as the voice of Officer Dibble for that movie. He also provided the voice of Professor X in \"Pryde of the X-Men\" (he had previously played X-Men nemesis Magneto during the character's appearance in the 1970s \"Fantastic Four\"). He also voiced Oompo and The Dirigible Captain in \"\".\n\nStephenson reprised his role of Luke from \"Wacky Races\" in the \"Wacky Races\" video game in 2000. His voice work after 2000 included doing guest voices for \"What's New, Scooby Doo?\", \"Johnny Bravo\", as Ganthet on \"Duck Dodgers\", and he also portrayed Grandpa Squirrel on \"Squirrel Boy\". In 2004, Stephenson narrated the featurette \"Space Age Gadgets\" for \"The Jetsons\" First Season DVD box set. He also narrated the featurette \"Wacky Inventions\" for \"The Flintstones\" Complete Series DVD box set. In 2010, Stephenson played Sheriff on \"Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo\", marking the first time he voiced a character on a direct-to-DVD Scooby-Doo movie.\n\nStephenson was also the narrator in the classic television series \"Dragnet\" (1967–1970), recapping the fate of the perpetrators at the end of every episode. (The opening narration at this time was performed by George Fenneman)\n\nHe provided the voice of Mr. Fernwell, using his \"Mr. Slate voice\" in a series of \"Accountemps\" radio ads.\n\nStephenson died of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 91 on May 15, 2015. He is survived by his wife, their two children (a son and a daughter) and a granddaughter.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The square was named after the giant statue of a golden \"Bauhinia blakeana\" at the centre of the area, situated outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the ceremonies for the handover of Hong Kong and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were held in July 1997. A flag-raising ceremony is held every day at 8:00 am. It is considered a tourist attraction.\n\nThe sculpture, a gilded flower bauhinia, is six metres high. The major part is composed of a bauhinia on a base of red granite pillar on a pyramid.The sculpture is deemed an important symbol for the Hong Kong people after the handover. On the second day of Chinese New Year and National Day of the People's Republic of China, the square is lighted up by a firework show. The Golden Bauhinia has also been nicknamed the \"Golden Pak Choi\" by locals.\n\nThe official daily flag raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square located outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre is conducted by the Hong Kong Police Force. There are three types of ceremonies: Daily Flag Raising Ceremony (Daily, every day except 1st of each month), Enhanced Flag Raising Ceremony (on the 1st of every month, except July and October) and the Special Flag Raising Ceremony (1 July and 1 October).\n\nThe daily ceremony includes regular attire and includes the playing of the national anthem, while the enhanced ceremony includes a flag-raising party of Hong Kong police officers, accompanied by a rifle unit all in ceremonial dress, and also includes the playing of the national anthem by the Police Band followed by a 10-minute musical performance by the Police Pipe Band.\n\nSince July 2008, on the second Sunday of each month, the flag raising ceremony is conducted by different local youth uniformed groups (UGs). The UGs conduct the daily flag raising ceremony (i.e. the flag party consists of five members: one commander, two national flag raisers and two regional flag raisers) without a band performance.\n\n"}

Born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, she graduated with a fine arts degree from the Juilliard School. She began acting in Broadway productions, making her debut with Paul Simon's \"The Capeman\", and later ventured into film and television roles. Ramirez is a recipient of a Tony Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Satellite Award, among other accolades.\n\nRamirez's portrayal of the original Lady of the Lake in the 2005 Broadway musical \"Spamalot\" won her acclaim and the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She gained wider recognition for her role as Dr. Callie Torres in \"Grey's Anatomy\". She made her debut as a voice artist with the 1999 video game entitled \"UmJammer Lammy\", and has voiced Queen Miranda in the animated series \"Sofia the First\" (2012–2018).\n\nRamirez released her first single \"Silent Night\" in 2009. Her self titled extended play debuted at no. 37 at the \"Billboard 200\" in 2011. Ramirez is also an activist and extensively campaigns for LGBT rights. She was awarded the Ally for Equality Award by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation in 2015.\n\nRamirez was born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico. Her father is Mexican and her mother is of Mexican and Irish-American descent. Her parents divorced when she was eight years old, and Ramirez went to live with her mother. They eventually settled in Tierrasanta, San Diego, California. Ramirez's interest in music encouraged her mother to send her to San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts, where she discovered her singing talent during an audition. Ramirez started acting in stage productions at her high school.\n\nAfter having played such roles as the Witch in \"Into the Woods\", Dolly in \"Hello\", Dolly! and Miss Hannigan in \"Annie\", Ramirez was recommended for the Juilliard School, New York City. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (dramatics). At Juilliard, she further worked on her acting skills and trained as a vocalist. Ramirez speaks both Spanish and English fluently.\n\nWhile still at Juilliard, Ramirez was discovered by a casting director and was offered the role of Wahzinak in Paul Simon's 1998 Broadway musical \"The Capeman\". Based on the life of the Puerto Rican gangster Salvador Agron, the production garnered negative reviews, but Ramirez was singled out for her \"outstanding\" performance. She made her screen debut in the same year, with a minor yet \"memorable\" role in the romantic comedy \"You've Got Mail\". Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film had Ramirez play Rose, a Zabars cashier who was \"\"very serious\" about her line's cash-only policy.\" Ramirez voiced the titular character of Lammy in the video game \"UmJammer Lammy\", a spin-off of \"PaRappa the Rapper\", on Sony's PlayStation console. She later reprised her role in the latter's sequel for PlayStation 2, but had a smaller role.\n\nIn 1999, Ramirez appeared in Mark Lamos' \"The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm\" (1999). She garnered praise for her performance and received an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination for her role. Charles Isherwood of \"Variety\" praised her \"beautiful, smoky voice\" but was critical of her \"torchy\" performance of \"The Man I Love,\" which ignored \"the wry irony that infuses Ira's lyrics\". Ramirez then appeared in the 2001 Broadway production of Edward Kleban's \"A Class Act\". She replaced Julia Murney (from the off-Broadway) to play the role of Felecia, the protagonist Ed's boss. The same year, she starred in other productions including \"Fascinating Rhythm\" and \"Dreamgirls\", and then performed in the 2002 production of \"The Vagina Monologues\" with Tovah Feldshuh and Suzanne Bertish. During this time, Ramirez also appeared in guest roles in several television series, including \"NYPD Blue\", \"\", \"Third Watch\", and \"Spin City\" among others.\n\nRamirez's breakout role came when she was cast as the Lady of the Lake in Eric Idle and John Du Prez's musical \"Spamalot\". Based on the 1975 film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", the musical opened on Broadway in 2005 to widespread acclaim. Ramirez was singled out for her performance, winning several awards including the 2005 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" described her as \"a toothsome devourer of scenery\", and another reviewer for The Playgoer emphasizing her stage presence remarked, \"Her intensity is totally serious and totally ludicrous and totally on key\". An \"Entertainment Weekly\" review gave her the highest praise by calling her a show-stealer.\n\nAfter her success on Broadway, Ramirez joined the cast of the ABC medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" in a recurring role as Dr. Calliope 'Callie' Torres, a love interest for Dr. George O'Malley, in the show's second season. On a special \"Grey's Anatomy\"-themed episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", she revealed that top executives from ABC, who were greatly impressed by her performance in Spamalot, offered her a role in any ABC show she wanted. She picked \"Grey's\", as she was already a fan of the show. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her and intended to add her to the show but did not know whom to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, \"Pick a show, any show\", explaining that it is rare. The series creator and executive producer, Shonda Rhimes explained, \"I was looking for a girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no idea what I was looking for.\" Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after she met her. Ramirez, who was initially given a recurring status at the time of the character's inception, received a star billing in the show's third season, alongside fellow cast member Eric Dane, who portrayed Dr. Mark Sloan.\n\nRamirez provided \"a cappella\" vocals in the song \"Silent Night\" for the soundtrack of the show's sixth-season episode \"Holidaze,\" airing on November 19, 2009. Ramirez served as the main vocalist for the musical episode of \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Song Beneath the Song\", which on aired March 31, 2011. Marcus James Dixon of Gold Derby calling her the \"show-stopper\", wrote that she \"stole the show in a gut-wrenching performance worthy of an Emmy award.\" In May 2016, Ramirez left the show at the conclusion of the twelfth season, after having played the character for a decade. She released a statement saying, \"I'm deeply grateful to have spent the last 10 years with my family at Grey's Anatomy and ABC, but for now I'm taking some welcome time off\".\n\nAs the series progressed, the character's popularity soared and Ramirez garnered widespread recognition and critical acclaim for her portrayal of a complex character on television. Maggie Fremont, a TV critic for \"Vulture\", reviewed Ramirez and Jessica Capshaw’s performances during an eleventh season episode, calling them \"goddesses walking amongst mere mortals\". Rhimes wrote of Ramirez's work on the show, \"Dr. Callie Torres came into our lives dancing it out in her underwear almost a decade ago, and I could not be happier or more proud of her journey. Sara Ramirez's performance inspired me as well as millions of fans each week.\" Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards in 2007 and 2008. Also in 2007, at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of Grey's Anatomy received the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She and the cast were nominated for the same award in 2008. In 2011, at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards, Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.\"\"\n\nRamirez turned producer with the 2016 teen comedy film, \"Loserville\". The project was released in partnership with the Pacer Foundation's Center for Bullying Prevention & Stomp Out Bullying.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Ramirez co-starred in the fourth and fifth seasons of the CBS political drama \"Madam Secretary\", replacing Bebe Neuwirth, who played Nadine Tolliver. She played Kat Sandoval, the new policy advisor of Secretary Elizabeth McCord (Téa Leoni).\n\nIn June 2011, Ramirez got engaged to her longtime partner, Ryan DeBolt, a business analyst at TIMEC in Paris, France. They were married on July 4, 2012, in a private beachside ceremony in New York. \n\nIn September 2016, Ramirez donated her hair to Locks of Love, an organization that makes wigs for children who suffer from medical conditions that lead to hair loss. Afterward, she sported a buzz cut, styled as an undercut.\n\nIn October 2016, Ramirez came out as bisexual at the True Colors Fund's \"40 To None Summit\" (now known as the \"Impact Summit\") in Los Angeles, California. In an email to \"The Huffington Post\", she wrote that her decision to come out publicly was a \"very organic and natural\" one.\n\nRamirez released her first single, a rendition of Silent Night, in 2009. Her debut, self-titled, extended play came out in March 2011, on the iTunes Store under the label of Atrevida Records. The EP included four songs, including a cover of \"The Story\", which was originally recorded by Brandi Carlile in her \"2007 album\". Two of the three songs were co-written by Ramirez and the album's writer-producer Rob Giles. \"Sara Ramirez\" debuted at number thirty-seven on the \"Billboard\" 200, number nine on \"Billboard\" Independent Albums chart, and number thirty-eight on the Canadian Albums Chart. \"The Story\" debuted the same week at number 69 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 72 on the Canadian Hot 100, and number 34 on the Irish Singles Chart. Soundtracks for \"Monty Python's Spamalot (Original Broadway Cast Recording)\" (2005) and \"\" (2011) were released under the labels of Decca Records and ABC Studios respectively.\n\nRamirez is an activist and extensively campaigns for LGBT rights.

{"id": "1999326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999326", "title": "National Stadium, Singapore", "text": "National Stadium, Singapore\n\nThe National Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Kallang, Singapore. It was completed in late 2013 and officially opened on 30 June 2014, on the site of the former National Stadium, which was closed in 2007 and demolished in 2010. A centrepiece of the larger Singapore Sports Hub complex, the stadium hosts major association football matches, including the home matches of the Singapore national team.\n\nThe stadium features the world's largest retractable domed roof and the configurable seating on the lowest spectator tier to make it the only stadium in the world that is custom-designed to host different sporting events at any given time. Depending on its configurations, the stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 55,000 for football and rugby, 52,000 for cricket and 50,000 for athletics events/concerts. The roof is made out of insulated metal to reflect sunlight.\n\nIn addition to Singapore's home games, the stadium also hosts other sporting and cultural events, including the International Champions Cup and the Singapore Sevens. It hosted the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, the 2014 World Club 10s, the 2014 and 2019 Brasil Global Tour, and the 2016 Singapore National Day Parade (NDP). It is also one of the alternating venues of the Basic Military Training Graduation Parade for the Singapore Armed Forces recruits since September 2015. Since 2016, the National Stadium no longer hosts future NDP events due to the high costs of the venue.\n\nConstruction work for the sports hub started in 2010 due to the delays caused by the 2008 financial crisis and soaring construction costs. By September 2011, the pilling and the foundation of the stadium was completed and construction on the steelworks of the stadium fixed roof started. On July 2013, the installation of the stadium final primary steel 'runway truss' for the roof was completed marking the completion of the steelworks on the National Stadium's fixed roof in preparation for installation of the retractable roof. The stadium was set to be completed in April 2014, however, In February 2014, Sports Hub CEO Philippe Collin Delavaud announced that the National Stadium's completion was pushed back to June 2014.\n\nThe stadium has mechanised and automated configurable spectator tiers depending on the event that will be hosted, namely \"Football/Rugby mode\", \"Cricket mode\" and \"Athletics mode\". To reconfigure from the athletics mode to the football/rugby mode, the lowest spectator tier can be moved 12.5 meters forward, obscuring the athletics running track underneath the seats and thus bringing spectators close to the pitch to provide optimum spectator viewing distances. It takes approximately 48 hours to reconfigure seating arrangements to suit an upcoming event. An energy-efficient cooling system is also designed to deliver cooled air to every seat in the stadium while using less than 15 percent of energy as compared to a conventional air-conditioned stadium, providing every spectator a cool and comfortable time to enjoy an event.\n\nThe National Stadium currently holds the record of the largest dome structure in the world. The retractable roof itself will take an approximate 25 minutes to open or close. The roof is made out of a lightweight material called ETFE, which is weather-resistant and blocks the sun's heat, giving shade and protecting spectators from the hot and humid Singapore weather and potential torrential rain. At night, the retractable roof doubles as a giant projector screen on both sides, which can display images such as the Singapore Flag during the National Day Parade.\n\nDesso GrassMaster was installed as the original grass pitch when the stadium opened. The sandy pitch was criticised by Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri during a pre-season friendly there in August 2014 and resulted in his decision not to field Carlos Tevez due to injury concerns. Afterwards, S$1.5 million of special growth lights were installed to stimulate and speed up the growth of the grass, with one of the main concerns being getting the pitch ready for the 2014 Suzuki Cup at the end of the year. In October 2014, Brazil coach Dunga criticised the state of the pitch, which had not improved much since the Juventus match, when his side were in Singapore to play a friendly against Japan. Although Brazil won the match 4–0, he said after the match that the sandy pitch had prevented his side from playing their best football. Eventually, the grass still failed to grow well and was replaced by the Eclipse Stabilised Turf in May 2015.\n\nThe stadium is located above the underground Stadium MRT station on the Circle Line. Trains arrive every five to six minutes during off-peak hours, and two to three minutes during peak hours and event days. Other MRT stations nearby are Kallang MRT station which can be accessed using a sheltered walkway, and Mountbatten MRT station. Both of these stations are within of the stadium. The upcoming Tanjong Rhu MRT station will complement the existing stations once completed in 2023.\n\nBus stops are located around the Sports Hub complex along Stadium Walk, Stadium Boulevard and Nicoll Highway, with buses serving nearby districts and the city. Taxi stands are also conveniently available near the National Stadium, Singapore Indoor Stadium and Leisure Park Kallang.\n\nSports Hub was meant to replace the Old National Stadium as a premium location for high spectator capacity Singapore sports, large scale national events and top entertainment acts, but its operation was marked by several controversies.\n\nThe quality of the field pitch was put under scrutiny after the football match between Juventus and Singapore in August 2014, and again in October 2014 during the Brazil vs Japan friendly. The initial Desso GrassMaster system made of synthetic fibres and natural grass was widely criticised for its sandy nature and was replaced by the lay-and-play natural pitch in 2015.\n\nPlans to hold major sports events at the stadium were scrapped due to the high costs of rental. Talks to hold The Merlion Cup football quadrangular and the Asia Masters Athletics Championships did not go through and the discussion to hold the 2016 NDP were stalled for a month due to cost issues as well.\n\nThe old National Stadium was demolished to make way for the Sports Hub, which was seen as a possible new location for future National Day Parades (NDP) in Singapore. The venue hosted the NDP in 2016, two years after opening. However, the new stadium is considered unsuitable as the Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team is unable to parachute into the domed stadium due to safety concerns.\n\nThe dome structure also obstructs the view from outside, making the traditional military flypast and outdoor fireworks hard to observe for the stadium spectators. Heavy armoured military vehicles also cannot drive past spectators as the stadium tracks are not designed to accommodate them.\n\nIt is also three times more expensive for the government to hold national day parade at the new stadium compared to the temporary floating platform, Float@Marina Bay, despite being a public-private partnership. Under the contract between the Sports Hub and Singapore Government, NDP organisers were allowed 45 days of free annual usage of the venue. However, technicians and performers reported that the time frame needed to be extended to 80 days, to which the Sports Hub requested an additional $10 million. In the end the total cost of running the event (rental) in 2016 was S$39.4 million. In October 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Marina Bay Floating Platform will be used as the primary venue for future NDPs.\n\nThe National Stadium hosted the opening ceremony and other events during the 2015 Southeast Asian Games. Other sports events included the World Club 10s Rugby in June 2014, a friendly match between Juventus and a Singapore Selection side in August 2014, which was the first-ever football match at the new stadium. The friendly match between Brazil and Japan in October 2014 is the first-ever sell-out crowd of 55,000 at the stadium. It also hosted the 2014 AFF Suzuki Cup in November 2014. It is the venue of all the matches of the 2015 Barclays Asia Trophy that is held in Singapore. The stadium was the venue for the 2016 National Day Parade.\n\nFrom June 2014 onwards, the stadium will also host cricket with day-night One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals matches. There is a prospect of international cricket fixtures and is the possibility of the International Cricket Council moving its headquarters from Dubai to Singapore.\n\nConcerts from artists outside Asia are highlighted in light blue.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999331", "title": "Film scanner", "text": "Film scanner\n\nA film scanner is a device made for scanning photographic film directly into a computer without the use of any intermediate printmaking. It provides several benefits over using a flatbed scanner to scan in a print of any size: the photographer has direct control over cropping and aspect ratio from the original, unmolested image on film; and many film scanners have special software or hardware that removes scratches and film grain and improves color reproduction from film.\n\nFilm scanners can accept either strips of 35 mm or 120 film, or individual slides. Low-end scanners typically only take 35mm film strips, while medium- and high-end film scanners often have interchangeable film loaders. This allows the one scanning platform to be used for different sizes and packaging. For example, some allow microscope slides to be loaded for scanning, while mechanised slide loaders allow many individual slides to be batch scanned unattended.\n\nDust and scratches on the film can be a big problem for scanning. Because of their reduced size (compared to prints), the scanners are capable of resolutions much higher than a regular flatbed scanner; typically at least 2000 samples per inch (spi), up to 4000 spi or more. At these resolutions dust and scratches take on gigantic proportions. Even small specks of dust, invisible to the naked eye, can obscure a cluster of several pixels. For this reason, techniques have been developed to remove their appearance from a scan, see film restoration.\n\nThe simplest is the median filter, often called \"despeckle\" in many graphic manipulation programs, e.g. in Adobe Photoshop and the GIMP. It works by examining a pixel in relation to the pixels surrounding it; if it is too different from the surrounding pixels then it is replaced with one set to their median value. This and other methods can be quite effective but have the disadvantage that the filter cannot know what actually is dust or noise. It will also degrade fine detail in the scan.\n\nInfrared cleaning works by collecting an infrared channel from the scan at the same time as the visible colour channels (red, green, and blue). This is done by using a light source that also produces infrared radiation, and having a fourth row of sensors on the linear CCD sensor. Photographic film is mostly transparent to infrared radiation (no matter what the visible image contains) but dust and scratches aren't, so they show up in the IR channel. This information can then be used to automatically remove the appearance of dust and scratches in the visible channels and replace them with something similar to their surroundings. A major limitation of this technique is that it can only be used on dye-based (color and chromogenic black-and-white) films; the image-forming silver particles in most black-and-white film stocks are opaque to infrared radiation.\n\nScanner manufacturers usually have their own name attached to this technique. Kodak developed Digital ICE at their Austin development centre, and is licensed by Epson, Konica Minolta, Microtek, Minolta, Nikon, and some others. Canon developed its own FARE (Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement) system. LaserSoft Imaging developed the iSRD dust and scratch removal, on which among others Plustek is relying.\n\n\n"}

People came as early as 7:00 a.m. in order to get good vantage points. Singapore's first President, Yusof bin Ishak and Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, were seated with members of the government at the grandstand on the steps of City Hall. When the parade began, six military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, Singapore Police Defense Force and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding it all was a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide.\n\nThe following year in 1967, the contingents increased to 76, including those of the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups. The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s. Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade. The 1968 edition, although held on a rainy morning that surprised even the marching contingents and the dignitaries, saw the first ground performances on the Padang as the weather improved - a prelude to today's show performances. 1969's parade, the one where the Mobile Column made its first drivepast, commemorated the 150th year of the city's founding and had Princess Alexandra of the UK as principal guest.\n\nThe fifth NDP edition in 1970 introduced the Flypast of the State Flag and the Republic of Singapore Air Force Flypast, as well as the combat simulation performance by Singapore Army personnel was one of the new highlights for that year.\n\nThe 1971 NDP was the first to include the iconic mobile parade floats from various organizations and choirs.; 1973 was the first parade to be held from late-afternoon to early-evening time in order to promote the parade with better attendance. 1974's parade marked the first time the parade was broadcast in full-colour, after such television was introduced for the first time a month prior on 7 July.\n\nIn 1975, to commemorate the Decennial anniversary of independence, the Parade was, for the first time, decentralized into 13 parade venues for more public participation. Almost all of the venues lasted for an hour and all of them even had route marches on the streets to the participating venues.\n\nBy the time the NDP was held at the National Stadium (for the first time) in 1976, the NDP Guard of Honour, composed of officers and personnel of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force made its first appearance, followed after the parade proper by the very first evening presentations by various groups, a prelude to future evening NDPs in 1980 and from 1984 onward. 1977's parade was a decentralized event like two years before (and like 1968's was affected by wet weather) while 1978 returned to Padang. 1979's parade saw another decentralized site, this time being held in many high schools and sports stadiums nationwide. The decentralized format would later be used until 1983, which was the final time NDP was held in multiple venues until 2020.\n\nThe 15th installment in 1980 was the first parade to introduce the feu de joie of the Guard-of-Honour contingents. The following year, SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989, made its inaugural appearance, followed by the SCDF in 1982. The 1981 parade was held in both Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase public attendance and participation in the celebrations. In 1982, the parade returned at Padang, marked the first time the mobile column drove past after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward, once every five years.\n\nThe 1984 installment featured many firsts in commemoration with the Singapore's Silver Jubilee of self-governance, which for the first time, introduced a theme song \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and included a bigger Mobile Column, the first appearance of the popular Silent Precision Drill Squad from the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command and the first evening fireworks display.\n\nThe 1986 edition was the first parade held in the late evening, and the first to use flashlights for audience use. Other introductions were featured over the years such as the first appearance of the massed military bands of the SAF (1987), the card stunt (1988), and the Red Lions parachute team and the daylight fireworks (1989). In 1989, the parade was held on the afternoon but was later revert to the evening format since 1991.\n\nIn 1993, interactive participation by the public debuted in that year's edition to increase public participation and awareness of the parade as an important part of Singaporean life and as a symbol of national unity and identity. In 1997, a National Education Show was also introduced where Primary Five students from a selected number of schools attended in one of the rehearsals.\n\nIn 2003, due to overcrowding of tickets, the electronic voting ticketing system was introduced as a countermeasure, and a ballot was conducted where citizens stand a chance at winning the tickets by registering their e-mail addresses or mobile numbers such as the NDP websites or phone lines.\n\nThe 2006 installment marked the final time the National Stadium in Kallang was held before the stadium went for retrofitting works and thus relocating the parade to the new venue to The Float @ Marina Bay and held its inaugural parade the following year. Starting in 2008, the NDP is also aired all over the Asia-Pacific region through CNA, and since 2012, it was simulcast to other internet web-streaming websites such as Toggle, xinmsn (defunct since 2015), and YouTube (along with the parade's official channel, NDPeeps). 2009 featured, for the first time, an integrated show including the parade segment, known as the Pre-parade show (usually not broadcast on television). 2009 was currently the last time to feature multiple theme songs (English and Chinese versions, or originals)\n\nThe 2013 installment featured a spin-off reality competition aired on Channel 5, titled \"Sing a Nation\", which featured ten different groups who performed various songs for a chance at a lead performance for the 2013's parade. The 2013's theme song, \"One Singapore\", was also sung by the cast of \"Sing a Nation\", and the song featured its largest ensemble, with 68 members.\n\nThe 2014 installment also featured its first female Red Lion parachutist to jump at the NDP, Third Warrant Officer Shirley Ng, after their initial performance in 2013 was cancelled due to weather conditions. The 2014 parade was notable as it was the last parade with the attendance for the first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was the only member to have attended in every installment of NDP since 1966, as he died on 23 March the following year.\n\n2015's parade was the first parade to be held at both the Padang and at the Float at Marina Bay, breaking a parade tradition in the process as it became the first parade since 1983 to be held in multiple venues. In 2016, the parade returned to the new National Stadium, first opened in 2014.\n\nDue to criticisms relating to budget and logistics, the following parade in 2017 (and later in 2018) returned to The Float @ Marina Bay to celebrate the golden jubilee for National Service. 2017 also saw the first time YouTube live-streamed the parade in a 360-degree format and on Facebook Live.\n\nThe 2019 installment, which was held at the Padang again and breaking a trend of holding every five years to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of modern foundation of Singapore in 1819, also marked the first time the parade was screened in ultra 4K resolution.\n\nThe two upcoming installments, due to held in 2020 and 2021, would be one of the last NDPs to be held at Marina Bay Floating Platform before the venue would undergo retrofitting works.\n\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the 2020 parade marking 55 years of nationhood will featured a \"reduced\" version by limiting rehearsals and performances and foregone both National Education and preview shows, and in which the parade will be broadcast remotely which consists of a pre-recorded morning segment (such as flying of state flag and F-15SG fighter jet display flying across the heartlands) and an evening segment (focusing most of the traditional national day parade performance, to be held on The Star Performing Arts Centre). The ceremonial events, just like last year, will be held in the Padang, which will have the first ever midday celebrations for the first time in many years, while the Mobile Column will be present also in the heartlands areas. With several venues set to host the celebrations, this is the very first decentralized parade ever done since 1983.\n\nThe venue of the parade was once held at Padang, the site where of Singapore's independence was declared. Between 1966 and 1974, the venue was located in the central area to bring the parade closer to the people. In 1976, the parade was held for the first time at the Former National Stadium, where the much larger capacity allowed for more to view the parade live.\n\nAlthough offering about 60,000 seats in the National Stadium, the demand for tickets remained high, resulting in several attempts to decentralise the venue to bring the celebration closer to more Singaporeans. From 1975 to 1983, celebrations were alternated between a decentralised event and one centred at the Padang or stadium. From 1984, the parade was held twice at the stadium before being brought back to the Padang. This three-year cycle was repeated up to 1994, before it changed to five-years on an announcement in 1995.\n\nThe Padang, although historically important, posed a greater logistical challenge and also offered fewer seats for spectators. The event and rehearsals also required the closing of surrounding roads. There was a need to construct temporary spectator stands around the field. The site, however, was the only feasible venue for the mobile column, as the heavy vehicles could not be driven onto the stadium track. The Padang was used as the main performance venue for the 2005 parade, with fringe activities decentralised to Marina South, Jurong East, Yishun and Tampines. Several alternate locations were mooted, including the utilization of the Padang, which is physically bigger and less likely to disrupt daily functions in the city.\n\nOn 16 October 2005, it was announced that the 2006 NDP would be held at the old stadium for the last time before moving to The Float @ Marina Bay. The 130 by 100 metre platform would be used for the next five years until the new stadium is completed. Despite offering a seating capacity of only 27,000, almost less than half the capacity for the National Stadium, there was a vast area for about another 150,000 spectators along the Marina Bay waterfront.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, the 2016 edition of NDP officially returned to the new National Stadium, and 2017 saw the parade returning to Marina Bay, therefore returning to a modified form of the 1980s parades. Given the huge public reception of the Marina Bay parades, The Float, soon to be renamed NS Square, will be expanded starting in 2021 for future parades as a potential permanent parade venue, alternating with the Padang every five years (2020 was the first year to break the pattern since 1985, as the site previously held in 2019 prior because of celebrating the nation's bicentennial anniversary).\n\nThe 2020 parade, first announced to return to The Float, will not take place as a measure enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with decentralized celebrations taking its place.\n\nSince 1998, a unique logo design was selected to represent NDP on all fronts. Even though there had been logos for some previous years' parades, the logos were used exclusively for years of special commemoration, such as silver jubilee of Nation Building (1984) and Independence (1990). Solgans have also be used, such as \"Our Singapore, Our Future\", first used in the 1997 celebrations.\n\nWith the introduction of NDP logos for 1998, every logo henceforth would be designed to suit the themes, in particular the foundation theme of the parade. A tagline, which was previously known as a slogan, was usually added to the logo design. An example was in 2005, where the tagline for NDP 2005 was \"The Future is Ours to Make\", was placed on the theme \"40 Years of Nation Building\". These taglines are usually taken from previous National Day Rallies for the purpose of rallying the nation together on 9 August to meet the challenges ahead. The tagline \"Together We Make The Difference\" was introduced in 1999 due to the launch of the Singapore 21 project, and was replaced by \"Together, A New Singapore\" in 2002 when then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the \"Remaking Singapore\" initiative in the National Day Rally 2001.\n\nMost of the logos uses a majority of red color, however in 2007, blue has taken over the traditional red to symbolise the water around the Marina Bay area. Regardless, the logos are important to note that the themes and taglines are largely different; and it is the theme that the parade or Show segment, on in some cases (2009 and 2015), both will be based on.\n\nAlthough the programme and sequence of the parade do change over the years, several components and the overall flow of the parade have remained intact for the past four decades. With the shifting of venues for some editions of the parade, or in cases such as wet weather, programmes may have to cancel or introduce slight modifications in order to suit the changes, for instance the Mobile Column, which is only possible both at the Padang site and at Marina Bay.\n\nThe pre-parade segment today may include mass-displays, choir performances, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances to entertain the crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became an integral part of the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to do when the parade proper begins.\n\nMotivators from TOUCH Community Services were introduced to the pre-parade in 2002 (then called Anchor Talents). TOUCH Community Services has since moved on to mentoring students from the various Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs) and various Polytechnics since 2003 until the present, under the Leadership & Mentoring programme. Colorful costumes and dance moves have been designed for the motivators.\n\nThe parade has been a traditional segment of the National Day Parade. Participants of the parade include members of the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, representatives of the People's Action Party, different labour unions (including members of the National Trades Union Congress) and Ministries as well as students in uniformed groups (such as the National Cadet Corps, National Police Cadet Corps, National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, the Singapore Red Cross, the Boys' and Girls' Brigades, the Scouts Association, the Girl Guides and St. John Ambulance Brigade) and representatives of various Singapore business entities.\n\nParticipants are split into two main sections: the Guard-of-Honour contingents and the Supporting Contingents. The four Guard-of-Honour contingents are made up of members from the three arms of the Singapore Armed Forces (the Singapore Army, represented by the Best Combat Unit, for many years the 1st Commando Battalion of the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation; the Republic of Singapore Navy; and the Republic of Singapore Air Force) as well as the Singapore Police Force. All members of these contingents are dressed in their respective ceremonial uniforms, known as the No. 1 uniform. Behind the Guard-of-Honour contingents stand the Regimental Colours Party, where the 32 SAF regimental colours are held by a group of officers, known as ensigns, from the Singapore Armed Forces, with their armed escorts (until 1997 Service Regimental Colors from the SAF's three services led the colours party). The 3 State Colours are in between the Navy and Air Force Guard-of-Honour contingents, and are formed by Escorts(Specialists) and Ensigns (Junior Officers). \n\nThe parade's military bands are from both the SAF and SPF, and in recent years, the marching bands of both services' cadet organizations (the Singapore NCC Command Band and the NPCC Band) have joined them as well, with the Singapore NCC Command Band being part of the combined band since 2010. Before the 1994 creation of the SAF Bands the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, and the massed bands for the parade were, since the early 1970s, from a select band of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force Band (inter-service massed bands would only happen in 1987).\n\nThe parade traditionally starts with the Parade Regimental Sergeant Major (Parade RSM) forming up the parade on either the Padang, the field of the National Stadium or in front of the Marina Bay grandstand. The command of the parade is handed over to the Parade Commander once the parade has been formed up and properly dressed accordingly. Typically, both the Parade RSM and the Parade Commander come from the SAF, and usually hold a minimum rank of Master Warrant Officer, and Lieutenant Colonel respectively. Upon sizing and forming up the parade to full formation, the Parade Commander will wait for the arrival of the members of Parliament, members of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister of Singapore, in that order (the salutes were dropped partially in 2008, and the Prime Minister's salute was dropped the next year). Upon the arrival of each group, the parade will present its salute and present arms, except for the Parliament and Cabinet members, upon which they stand at attention and only the PC salutes them.\n\nLastly once the President of Singapore has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will call for a full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, will be played accompanied by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the President will be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to some members of the Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander.\n\nAt the end of it (with the GOH contingents now at shoulder arms), the Parade Commander will ask the President for permission for the Parade Marchpast to start. 2012's edition formally included an Advance in Review order to the proceedings for the first time.\n\nThe Parade Commander will command the Parade contingents to prepare for the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands bringing the rear. In the National Day Parade 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the F1 Pit Building. In the National Day Parade 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the President Tony Tan Keng Yam, had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions with all of them rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to Marina Bay Sands where the march ended. The Onward March made yet another appearance in the 2014 edition alongside the City Marchpast after the parade proper towards the MBS complex. The City Marchpast made its sixthth consecutive appearance in the 2015 edition and was carried on in 2016 together with the Onward March from the new National Stadium and again from Marina Bay in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn recent years the order of the march past of the supporting contingents out of the grounds has been altered, with the military and civil uniformed services first to march out, followed by the economic firms, social organizations and the youth uniformed organizations which march last out and then into the platform stands.\n\nThe first Mobile Column was organized in 1969 which displayed the then newly acquired armour vehicles of the SAF, the RSP's police vehicles and the SCDF's fire trucks. In 1990, after a six-year hiatus, the Mobile Column returned as part of the silver jubilee of Singapore's independence. It has been on show during the more important milestone anniversaries of the nation's birthday, on parades held in Padang every five years, including 2019, 2020 and 2025. In some celebrations, the vehicles forming the column would drive on to the heartlands areas of the city-state, letting residents and vistors see the equipment upclose in their communities as the column would drive thru their homes and workplaces.\n\nAlmost every NDP since 1971 (except 2016) has had a flypast segment featuring jet and training aircraft, transports and helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force.\n\nWhenever the NDP is held at The Float in Marina Bay the Mobile Column and flypast both evolve into the multi-platform and multi-service Dynamic Defence Display (D3), with a display of the military defence and public security capabilities of the uniformed services. In lieu of the 2018 D3, as part of the parade and ceremony segment of the program, a special flypast of the RSAF was held in that year's edition to mark its golden jubilee.\n\nThe spectacular show segment follows the traditional parade and ceremony, and lasts normally for 45 minutes. Following the theme of the parade that year, the Show will feature (aside from a Prologue in recent editions) three to four main Acts that culminates in a Grand Finale, that will usually feature the theme song of that year's parade, followed by the much anticipated fireworks display. The entire parade will end in a chorus of voices singing familiar National Day Songs, mass pledge taking (from 2009 expanded into a national activity) and the singing of the National Anthem. In 2007, the parade broke tradition for having a fireworks display that synchronized with the Sing Singapore medley in the finale. In 2009, for the first time ever, all the segments of the NDP have been merged into one integrated program; this would later be repeated in 2015.\n\nIt has its origins in early NDPs as various mass display items put up by community groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, ruggedness among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved over the years to become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows.\n\nFloat displays also featured prominently in the Show segments of the 1970s and 1980s where floats were designed to promote government campaigns or highlight the works of various public and private companies. This returned in NDP 1998 and in NDP 2005 as a visual representation of Singapore's past 40 years of nation building, with further reappearances at NDP 2009 and at NDP 2010 to symbolize the mixture of peoples that make up Singapore today. Floats would return in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 editions. Boats and floats on the Marina Bay area in view of the crowds were one of the highlights of the 2018 show segment.\n\nParades today, held from dusk to night, end in the climax of fireworks displays which have become a prominent feature in every parade, which followed by a medley of songs and then reciting the pledge and singing \"Majulah Singapura\". However, in the early parades that were held in the day (from 1965–72) and later afternoon to evening NDP editions from 1973 to 1980, 1982 and 1984, mass lion and dragon dance displays are actually the parade finale. Lion and dragon dance troupes from various community centres and clan associations would gather on the field to the resonating sound of drumbeats to put on a fiery display that end the parade on an auspicious note. These troupes later became integral parts of the 1985 and 1988 (evening) NDP editions.\n\nThough every show would see the participation of an assortment of public and private companies, there are three main anchors taking on each Act in the show segment. They are the Peoples' Association (which involvement started in 1984, and one of the founding participants), the Singapore Soka Association (SSA) (active since the 1970s) and the Ministry of Education, which would be represented by an individual institution or a cluster of schools, and also a founding participant of the parades. The latter also provides the Combined Schools Band and the Combined School Choirs, another regular part of the NDP itself, and since the 1970s has been part of the national celebrations. The Ministry also provides the School Display Band for the pre-parade segment of the programme, coming from one of the many schools in the island country pre-selected for performance in the event. Since 2016, volunteers from Team Nila are also involved as Precinct Ushers, Safety Management Aides and, most recently, as pre-show Active Health Ambassadors.\n\nVarious types of high-tech multimedia equipment are used during the actual show segment since 2003. Various technologies notable include the Projecteur d’Images Géantes Informatisées in 2003, a water-curtain visualization in 2007, and LED Mash in 2008.\n\nPost-parade parties was first televised in 1997 and featured celebrities and performers to celebrate the success of the parade while providing entertainment to the audience awaiting to leave the venue. The parade usually last for an hour and ends with the Chief of Defence Force, the Chairman of that year's NDP EXCO and the organizers to cutting a cake to commemorate the efforts with the participants with speeches of gratitude. The party is now normally anchored by the SAF Music and Drama Company.\n\nUnder the \"Sing Singapore\" Festival, which inaugurated in 1984, numerous community songs have been composed. Nonetheless, only few National Day songs which struck a chord among Singaporeans continue to be sung annually in the parade. They are collectively known as the Sing Singapore Medley which comes after the fireworks display during the Grand Finale segment, or since 2008, forming the final part of the display.\n\nOther National Day songs continue to be featured during the parade, either in the Pre-Parade segment, Parade and Ceremony segment or used as tunes to accompany the mass displays during the show part of the celebrations. In particular, for the Parade and Ceremony segment, in between the arrivals of Members of Parliament, Cabinet Ministers, the Prime Minister and the President, four songs each of one official language (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) will be performed. In previous years, the final song in English (before the President's arrival) has always been the NDP theme song (in 2007 this was not the case) while in NDP 2008, all the songs performed in the P&C segment (in between arrivals) were all previous NDP theme songs in recent years. (The song tradition would return in 2017, but only in the pre-parade portion and in a different language order, while past theme songs were played during the arrivals.) The music performed during the parades have evolved over the decades, reflecting not just the change of musical influences and styles, but also the country's multi-ethnic character.\n\nThe 2010 P&C songs were three in number, due to the fact that the arrival of the Parliament deputies happened before the parade, and were unique because all the songs sung were in English (one song even had lyrics in the three other major languages).\n\nIn 2011, there was the \"Fun Pack Song\" which went along to the tune of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance'. The song was shortly scrapped.\n\nThe 2013's medley saw a record number of NDP songs that featured in this medley, with ten and lasted about five-and-a-half minutes: \"Stand Up For Singapore\", \"We Will Get There\", \"What Do You See\", \"One United People\", \"Turn Up The Love\" (not including NDP songs), \"Home\", \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\", \"Count On Me Singapore\", \"We Are Singapore\" and \"One Singapore\" (that year's theme song).\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that there would be no new songs produced for National Day for the 2nd time in its long history, and in a historic move by the organizing committee, the classic NDP songs will be sung again. That year's edition saw past NDP theme songs being played during the arrival segments, and broke tradition by having the Sing Singapore Medley sung as the epilogue after the national anthem was played. The Sing Singapore Medley finale was repeated again in the 2015 event, after the Pledge Moment ends. Both cases have now included the 1998 theme song \"Home\" as part of the medley, just as it was the case in 2013.\n\n2016 will see the medley also accompanied by special needs students provided by the seven Voluntary Welfare Organisations of the island country hand-signing for the deaf and hard of hearing who will take part, yet another first. The 1998 theme \"Home\" was sung as well. (Since 1989 a deaf Representative has been present to sign the Pledge for deaf viewers of the event.)\n\nNDP Theme songs were first introduced in 1984, starting with \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and again in the 1985 Parade; \"Count on Me Singapore\" which was performed by Clement Chow at the 1986 Parade. Other notable songs include \"We are Singapore\" (1987–1988) and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" (1990).\n\nTheme songs were not prominent in the parades of the 1990s until in 1997, when the song \"Singapore Town\", composed and sung by the SAF Music and Drama Company, was that year's theme song. Only in the 1998 edition did interest in the NDP theme songs rose again with the widely acclaimed song \"Home\", a song composed by Dick Lee and sung by Kit Chan. That year's parade feature \"Home\" and one more NDP song, \"City For The World\", sung by the children choir. Its popularity led to the production of the various renditions in 2004, including a rock piece composed by JJ Lin. This is partly to use the platform of the televised national event to increase awareness to new National Day pieces composed for the Sing Singapore Festival held then.\n\nIn 2003, however, a significant split took place when the National Day theme song of that year was not part of \"Sing Singapore\" theme song. Stefanie Sun's \"One United People\" was used as the theme song to better suit the theme of \"A Cohesive Society\" while Sean Wang's \"A Place In My Heart\" was chosen to lead the \"Sing Singapore 2003\" Festival.\n\nBefore 2007, the theme songs come in two languages, the lingua franca in Singapore – English as well as Mandarin. To promote the songs, music videos that showcase local landmarks and lifestyle are made and shown on national television a month before National Day; the songs will also be played on local airwaves. Legal MP3 downloads are also available on the NDP website from 2010 onwards.\n\nLocal songbirds that made it big in regional music scenes, such as Kaira Gong, Kit Chan, Corrine May, Stefanie Sun and Tanya Chua have been invited back home to perform various National Day theme songs. The winner of \"Singapore Idol\" 2004, Taufik Batisah, became a prominent choice to lead the nation in singing the NDP 2005's theme song \"Reach Out for the Skies\", alongside singer-actress Rui En.\n\nIn 2007, there were two theme songs instead of the usual one. 2009 was the last time a Chinese rendition of the English song was featured.\n\nIn 2013, the National Day Parade theme song will not be sung by renowned local artists but, for the first time, by fellow Singaporeans that join the \"Sing A Nation\" reality-competition organized by MediaCorp for that year's event.\n\nIt would be in 2014 when the NDP will not have another official theme song in a break from tradition for the second time, due to decision made by the organizers. In place of the theme song was three songs were remade into two music videos: \"We Will Get There\" and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" sung by Ann Hussein, Rahimah Rahim, Gayle Nerva, Farisha Ishak, Tay Kewei and Tabitha Nauser; and \"What Do You See\" sung by Fauzie Laily, Jack Ho, Kartik Kunasegaran, Sivadorai \"Rai\" Sellakannu and Shaun Jansen. Dick Lee's 1996 song, \"Big Island\", debuted during the show segment of the parade. The theme song tradition would return in the 2015 installment again until 2018. The 2015 theme song, \"Our Singapore\", was remade as the theme song for 2019, and the 2018's parade features a remake of \"We Are Singapore\", both of which being the theme titles for that year's parade. The most recent installment to feature an original theme song was 2017, \"Because it's Singapore\", which was sung by \"Singapore Idol\" contestant Jay Lim.\n\nThe list of NDP theme songs are as follows:\n\n\nFunpacks was introduced in 1991, which contains goodies which distribution varies every year. These goodies include food, drinks, vouchers from various participating companies and sponsors, items and commodities intended for the use during the parade, such as a theme-designed torchlight and the Singapore flag. Most funpacks are designed by students from local polytechnics and community services, although an exception happened 2015, where people from all walks of life designed 50 designs for the funpack, which also include a Singa Lion Figurine, some snacks and games.\n\nMost of the years, the funpacks were also packed by selected members of the armed forces. In 2009, they were packed by prisoners through the Yellow Ribbon Project. In 2015, a similar funpack, the 'SG Funpack', was given out to every household.\n\nIn 2019, the funpacks are environmentally-friendly unlike the NDP 2018 Funpack.\n\nNDP are organised by the Singapore Armed Forces, with the involvement of a multitude of public and private organisations. The parade will see the formation of an NDP EXCO (Executive Committee) which oversees various aspects of the parade, from the Parade & Ceremony to the Show, from SICUS (Seating, Invitation, Car parking, Ushering and Security) to Website & Publicity. The EXCO is formed by military personnel and is usually headed by the Commander of the organising division. Civilians also sit on the EXCO as representatives of the various public agencies involved.\n\nSimilarly, sponsorship comes from various public and private organisations to fund this multi-million dollar production. This includes local organisations such as the Singapore Pools, Singapore Telecom, as well as multi national companies such as Volkswagen and Nokia. In recent years, sponsorship is divided into three categories depending on the amount of money pledged, including Principal, Major and Co-sponsors/partners.\n\nThe unit that will be the organizer of the event starts preparatory activities in October, just two months after the previous parade, with the formation of the EXCO and pre-parade planning, plus the official sponsorship launch. In recent years there has been public participation, which also involved with the choosing of the theme and the funpack design.\n\n\n"}

It is now also grown in fruit orchards in Korea, Japan, the United States, and Australia.\n\n\"Prunus salicina\" should not be confused with \"Prunus mume\", a related species also grown in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Another tree, \"Prunus japonica\", is also a separate species despite having a Latin name similar to \"Prunus salicina\"'s common name. Plant breeder Luther Burbank devoted a lot of work to hybridizing this species with the Japanese plum (\"Prunus salicina\") and developed a number of cultivars from the hybrid.\n\n\"Prunus salicina\" grows up to tall, and has reddish-brown shoots. The leaves are 6-12 cm long and 2.5-5 cm broad, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in early spring, 2 cm diameter with five white petals.\n\nThe fruit is a drupe 4-7 cm in diameter with yellow-pink flesh; it can be harvested in the summer. When fully ripe it can be eaten raw.\n\nIn China, candied fruits are also sold preserved, flavoured with sugar, salt, and liquorice. In Japan, it is also used half ripe as a flavouring in a liqueur called \"sumomo shu\" (すもも酒), and in China a liquor is made from the fruits. For other uses of this and similar species see plum.\n\nThe fruits are also used in Traditional Chinese medicine. Japanese plums cv. Crimson Globe may be taken as a source of antioxidants with a potential to counteract oxidation.\n\nThe species name is derived from the Latin word for willow.\n\nMany different varieties of \"Prunus salicina\", some being hybrid species, are cultivated in China. \"Prunus salicina\" is also widely cultivated in Japan and Korea. The most famous variety of this fruit in Vietnam is the Tam Hoa plum grown in Bắc Hà town, in Lào Cai Province.\n\nCultivars of the species were greatly improved in Japan and thence introduced into the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, where subsequent breeding produced many more cultivars, generally with larger fruit. Many of these American cultivars have been exported to other countries, including back to Japan, their ancestral place of origin.\n\nMost of the fresh plums sold in North American supermarkets are \"Prunus salicina\" cultivars. They are grown on a large scale in a number of other countries, for example, they dominate the stone fruit industry in Western Australia.\n\n\n"}

The team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL) from 2005 to 2013. The organization joined the North American Soccer League (NASL) as Ottawa Fury FC beginning in the 2014 season. The team's home stadium was the Algonquin College soccer complex; its colours were white, red and blue.\n\nThe Fury operated a women's soccer team, Ottawa Fury Women, in the USL W-League, and a team in the USL's Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella.\n\nOttawa Fury entered the PDL in 2005, joining fellow Canadian teams Thunder Bay Chill and Abbotsford Rangers in the American-based competition. Under the leadership of head coach Colin McCurdy – a Northern Irish legend from his time at Belfast club Linfield  – the Fury began brightly, beating Westchester Flames 3–0 in their opening fixture, and winning two of their next four, including a 5–3 victory at home over the Albany Admirals which featured a hat trick from Kevin Omokhua. Unfortunately, Ottawa could never quite string a run of results together; throughout the season, win would follow loss would follow win, although their points tally did keep them high in the standings all year long. A staggering 10–2 annihilation of Brooklyn Knights (which saw Francis Mavula net four goals) and an impressive 6–3 victory on the road over the Westchester Flames were the highlights of the rest of the regular season. A 4–3 defeat to Cape Cod Crusaders on the final day of the season left the Fury third in the Northeast behind Cape Cod, just out of the playoffs. Kevin Omokhua and Francis Mavula were a threatening strike force, netting 21 times between them, while Desmond Tachie contributed 7 goals and 7 assists.\n\nOttawa moved to the New England Division in 2006, and started the new season in decent form, with a win and two ties in their first three games. However, the Fury stuttered through June, losing 2–1 to Albany Admirals, and being beaten three times in thirteen days by the Cape Cod Crusaders. The 4–4 tie with Rhode Island Stingrays at the beginning of June, in which they threw away a 2-goal lead in the last 15 minutes, may have signalled a downturn in Fury's form, but to their credit they rallied towards the season's end. Ottawa won six of their last eight games, including a 3–0 revenge win over Rhode Island, but their late charge towards the playoffs was in vain; they finished the regular season second in the division, a full 20 points behind Cape Cod Crusaders, and failed to secure the post-season wild-card slot. Kevin Omokhua was again Ottawa's outstanding player in front of goal, with 11 for the season.\n\nHead coach McCurdy left at the end of 2006, and he was replaced by Chris Roth; unfortunately, his first season at the helm was a difficult one, as Fury suffered their worst run of results in the franchise's history. Despite an opening tie with Cape Cod Crusaders and a 3–2 win over PDL new boys Long Island Rough Riders in their first two games, Fury suffered an immediate down-turn in form. Fury won just one game in June – 4–0 over Vermont Voltage – and quickly fell out of contention for playoff consideration. Five straight games without a win in July, and eight in total, sent the Fury to the bottom of the Northeast Division table, and only a 4–0 final day win over bottom side Rhode Island Stingrays kept the Canadians from finishing last in the division. Will Beaugé was Fury's top scorer, with six goals, while English midfielder Yan Klukowski contributed 4 assists.\n\nHead coach Roth was replaced by Stephen O'Kane in the off-season, and seemed to have a positive effect on the squad. Ottawa bounded back spectacularly in 2008, enjoying what turned out to be the most successful – but ultimately frustrating – year in franchise history. Despite a rocky start in which they lost their opening two games, Fury responded with four wins in their next five games, including a 5–2 blowout over Vermont Voltage, a 4–1 rollover of Rhode Island Stingrays, and a comprehensive 3–0 win over Long Island Rough Riders. Ottawa's scintillating form continued throughout July, when they enjoyed a 9-game unbeaten run stretching back to the aforementioned Long Island game. Fury were powerhouses in front of goal – they crushed the Rhode Island Stingrays 5–0, and followed this up with a 7–0 annihilation of New Hampshire Phantoms, which saw seven different Fury players find the net. They entered their last game knowing that a win over Vermont would most likely give them the New England Division title over Cape Cod Crusaders; shockingly, they fell to a 3–0 defeat, and then were nudged out of the playoffs by Newark Ironbound Express, who finished second in the Northeast, and finished equal on points, but took the final playoff spot on head-to-head results. Will Beaugé and Florian Decamps were Fury's top scorers, with seven goals each, while Da Costa and Andrew Rigby both contributed four assists.\n\nAssistant Coach Klaus Linnenbruegger stepped up to take over the helm of the Ottawa Fury PDL. Linnenbruegger, who played professionally with Bielefeld in Germany, successfully coached Fury Youth teams over the previous seven seasons and is a past head coach of the Ottawa Wizards. The long-time Fury coach replaced Steve Payne who left the club by mutual consent.\n\nOn June 20, 2011, the North American Soccer League (NASL) announced that Ottawa Fury has been awarded an expansion team. The new team will be owned by the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group and play home games at Frank Clair Stadium at Lansdowne Park. On February 26, 2013, it was announced that the new team will carry the Ottawa Fury FC name and carry on the Ottawa Fury legacy.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999356", "title": "Obligatory Baháʼí prayers", "text": "Obligatory Baháʼí prayers\n\nObligatory Baháʼí prayers are prayers which are to be said daily by Baháʼís according to a fixed form decreed by Baháʼu'lláh. Prayers in the Baháʼí Faith are reverent words which are addressed to God, and refers to two distinct concepts: \"obligatory prayer\" and \"devotional prayer\" (general prayer). The act of prayer is one of the most important Baháʼí laws for individual discipline. Along with fasting, obligatory prayer is one of the greatest obligations of a Baháʼí, and the purpose of the obligatory prayer is to foster the development of humility and devotion. The obligation of daily obligatory prayer was prescribed by Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, in his book of laws, the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\".\n\nIt is forbidden to perform the obligatory prayers in congregation, so the daily obligatory prayers are offered individually, though it is not required that they be said in private.\n\nIn the \"Bayán\" the Báb prescribed an obligatory prayer of the nineteen rak'ah (prostrations). He never wrote the text of this prayer, making the implementation of this law dependent on the coming of the Promised One. The Báb explained that the prayer symbolizes a spiritual journey from the realm of the body to the realm of the heart, which can be described as an arc of ascent, mirroring the arc of descent from God to creation. \n\nIn the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", Baháʼu'lláh confirmed the law of daily obligatory prayer and wrote that the specific obligatory prayer was recorded in a separate tablet or writing. Baháʼu'lláh wrote the text mentioned, but never released it in order to avoid provoking conflict with Muslims. Instead, sometime before the writing of the supplement to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the \"Questions and Answers\", Baháʼu'lláh wrote a set of three obligatory prayers which are the ones used by Baháʼís today. The original obligatory prayer involved nine rak'ah and was to be said in the morning, noon and in the afternoon, probably three cycles at a time. After Baháʼu'lláh's death a strongbox holding the text of the original obligatory prayer was stolen by Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí.\n\nThe obligatory prayer is a primary religious obligation starting at the age of fifteen and it is the most important kind of prayer. The purpose of the obligatory prayer is to foster the development of humility and devotion. The Baháʼí writings strongly warn against neglecting the prayers or minimizing their importance. The obligatory prayers are a personal spiritual obligation, and failure to observe the law is seen to have only a spiritual penalty.\n\nUnlike general prayers in the Baháʼí Faith, there are specific regulations concerning the obligatory prayers; however, obligatory prayer is a personal spiritual obligation and thus no Baháʼí administrative sanction can be obtained if a Baháʼí fails to say his prayer daily.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh wrote three obligatory prayers — the \"short\", the \"medium\" and the \"long\" — and Baháʼís are free to choose to say one of the three each day. The short and the medium prayer have to be said at specific times; the short has to be said once between noon and sunset and the medium has to be said three times daily: once between dawn and noon, once between noon and sunset and once between sunset and two hours after sunset. The long prayer can be said at any time in the day. The medium and long prayers also include movements and gestures during the prayers, which are themselves obligatory except when a person is physically incapable of performing them. Shoghi Effendi has written that the motions and gestures are symbolic and are used to help maintain concentration during the prayers. Furthermore, the obligatory prayer is to be preceded by ablutions, the cleaning of the hands and face, and one has to face the Qiblih, which is the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nThe short prayer is a brief affirmation of the power of God and the servitude of the worshipper. The prayer should be said while standing in an attitude of humility before God, and it should be said between noon and sunset. The text of the prayer is:\n\nThe medium obligatory prayer must be said three times during the day: once between sunrise and noon, once between noon and sunset, and once after sunset till two hours after sunset. It includes a series of positions and movements from one position to the next, along with specific supplications. The prayer stresses the power and loftiness of God, and the grace that is shown through his revelation. The text of the medium obligatory prayer can be found in Baháʼu'lláh's \"Prayers and Meditations\".\n\nThe long obligatory prayer can be said anytime during the day. It includes a series of positions and movements from one position to the next, along with specific supplications. The prayer also includes parts where says the Greatest Name of God in the form of \"Allah-u-Abha\" at several points. About this prayer, Baháʼu'lláh has stated: \"\"...the long Obligatory Prayer should be said at those times when one feeleth himself in a prayerful mood. In truth, it hath been revealed in such wise that if it be recited to a rock, that rock would stir and speak forth; and if it be recited to a mountain, that mountain would move and flow. Well is it with the one who reciteth it and fulfilleth God's precepts. Whichever prayer is read will suffice.\"\" The text of the long obligatory prayer can be found in Baháʼu'lláh's \"Prayers and Meditations\". This prayer is known in Arabic as \"salat\" and as \"namaz\" in Persian, and is similar to the Islamic \"salat\".\n\nThere are a number of laws and practices associated with the obligatory prayers concerning how to say the obligatory prayer, when Baháʼís are exempt from saying the obligatory prayers, and what to do if one misses saying an obligatory prayer.\n\nThere are certain practices that must be associated with the saying of the obligatory prayers. They include performing ablution, which consist of washing the hands and face, before the obligatory prayer. In the case that water is unavailable, or its use harmful to the face or hands, the verse \"\"In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure\"\" should be repeated five times. The prayer should be said while the reader is facing the Qiblih which is the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh. It is also preferable for the reader to be standing while saying the obligatory prayers in an attitude of humble reverence. Baháʼí's are also obliged to repeat the Greatest Name (Alláh-u-Abhá) 95 times a day while sitting. Ablutions are also prescribed for this, but it is not necessary to do them again if the repetitions are done right after the daily obligatory prayer.\n\nExemptions from saying the obligatory prayer include:\n\nIn the case of a missed prayer due to insecurity such as during travel, each missed prayer can be compensated for by the repetition of certain verses and movements. The person should perform a single (laying the forehead on any clean surface) in the place of each unsaid obligatory prayer and the prostrations should be performed while saying the verse \"\"Glorified be God, the Lord of Might and Majesty, of Grace and Bounty.\"\" The prostrations should then be followed by saying the verse \"\"Glorified be God, the Lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven\"\" eighteen times while the person is sitting cross-legged.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh also wrote a specific prayer for the dead, known as the \"Obligatory prayer for the departed\", which is an unrelated practice, despite the similarity in terminology. This prayer is to be said before the interment of a Baháʼí who has reached the age of fifteen. It is a congregational prayer: the words are read aloud by a single person while others who are present stand in silence.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999367", "title": "Gitelman syndrome", "text": "Gitelman syndrome\n\nGitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive kidney tubule disorder characterized by low blood levels of potassium and magnesium, decreased excretion of calcium in the urine, and elevated blood pH. The disorder is caused by genetic mutations resulting in improper function of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (also known as NCC, NCCT, or TSC) located in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. The distal convoluted tubule of the kidney serves a minimal role in salt absorption and a greater role in managing the excretion of electrolytes like magnesium and calcium to produce more concentrated urine.\n\nGenetic mutations along the sodium chloride symporter, lead to inadequate transport of multiple electrolytes along this channel such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. The net effect is an electrolyte imbalance consistent with thiazide diuretic therapy\n\nGitelman syndrome was formerly considered a subset of Bartter syndrome until the distinct genetic and molecular bases of these disorders were identified. Bartter syndrome is also an autosomal recessive hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, but it derives from a mutation to the NKCC2 found in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.\n\nAffected individuals may not have symptoms in some cases. Symptomatic individuals present with symptoms identical to those of patients who are on thiazide diuretics, given that the affected transporter is the exact target of thiazides.\n\nClinical signs of Gitelman syndrome include a high blood pH in combination with low levels of chloride, potassium, and magnesium in the blood and decreased calcium excretion in the urine. In contrast to people with Gordon's syndrome, those affected by Gitelman syndrome generally have low or normal blood pressure. Individuals affected by Gitelman syndrome often complain of severe muscle cramps or weakness, numbness, thirst, waking up at night to urinate, salt cravings, abnormal sensations, chondrocalcinosis, or weakness expressed as extreme fatigue or irritability. Though cravings for salt are most common and severe, cravings for sour foods (e.g. vinegar, lemons, and sour figs) have been noted in some persons affected. More severe symptoms such as seizures, tetany, and paralysis have been reported. Abnormal heart rhythms and a prolonged QT interval can be detected on electrocardiogram and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported due to low potassium levels.\n\nPhenotypic variations observed among patients probably result from differences in their genetic background and may depend on which particular amino acid in the NCCT protein has been mutated. In a study by Riviera-Munoz et al. identified a subset of individuals with Gitelman syndrome with a severe phenotypic expression. The clinical manifestations observed in this group were neuromuscular manifestations, growth retardation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The patients were mostly male and were found to have at least one allele of a splice defect on the SLC12A3 gene.\n\nThe sodium chloride symporter is a protein made up of 1021 amino acids and 12 transmembrane domains. Mutations that occur on the SLC12A3 gene range from missense, nonsense, frame-shift and splice-site mutations which occur throughout the gene.\n\nMost cases of Gitelman syndrome are linked to inactivating mutations in the \"SLC12A3\" gene, resulting in a loss of function of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride co-transporter (NCCT). This genetic mutation in \"SLC12A3\" is present in 80% of adults with Gitelman syndrome. More than 180 mutations of this transporter protein have been described. This cell membrane protein participates in the control of ion homeostasis at the distal convoluted tubule portion of the nephron. Loss of this transporter also has the indirect effect of increasing calcium reabsorption in a transcellular fashion. This has been suggested to be the result of a putative basolateral Na/Ca exchanger and apical calcium channel.\n\nWhen the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCCT) is inactivated, continued action of the basolateral Na/K-ATPase creates a favourable sodium gradient across the basolateral membrane. This increases the reabsorption of divalent cations by secondary active transport. It is currently unknown why calcium reabsorption is increased while magnesium absorption is decreased, leading to a low level of magnesium in the blood .\n\nA secondary effect of the inactivated sodium-chloride cotransporter is the subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). RAAS activation is a byproduct of the failure of the distal convoluted tubule in reuptaking electrolytes specifically sodium and chloride leading to cellular dehydration. RAAS attempts to compensate for this dehydration resulting in low serum blood potassium.\n\nA small percentage of Gitleman syndrome cases can be attributed to mutations in the CLCNKB gene. This gene is related to the function of the renal chloride channel CLC-Kb located at the basolateral membrane of cells in the thick ascending limb of the Henle's loop. Genetic variations or mutations in the CLCNKB was initially linked to classic Bartter Syndrome. When mutations are not found within the SLC12A3 gene, screening can be done to rule out involvement of CLCNKB gene.\n\nGitelman syndrome is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner: one defective allele has to be inherited from each parent.\n\nDiagnosis of Gitleman syndrome can be confirmed after eliminating of other common pathological sources of hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. A complete metabolic panel (CMP) or basic metabolic panel (BMP) can be used to evaluate serum electrolyte levels. Renin and aldosterone can be tested in the blood. Electrolyte measurement and aldosterone levels cane be done via urine. The pathognomonic clinical markers include low serum levels of potassium, sodium,chloride, and magnesium in the blood as a result of urinary excretion. Other clinical indicators include elevated serum renin and aldosterone in the blood stream, as well as, excess alkaline in the body and suboptimal urinary calcium excretion. The symptomatic features of this syndrome are highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to mild manifestations (weakness, cramps) to severe symptoms (tetany, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis). Symptom severity is multi-factorial, with phenotypic expression varying amongst individuals within the same family. Genetic testing is another measure of identifying the underlying mutations which cause the pathologic symptoms of the disease. This mode of testing is available at select laboratories.\n\nMost asymptomatic individuals with Gitelman syndrome can be monitored without medical treatment. Dietary modification of a high salt diet incorporated with, potassium and magnesium supplementation to normalize blood levels is the mainstay of treatment. Large doses of potassium and magnesium are often necessary to adequately replace the electrolytes lost in the urine. Diarrhea is a common side effect of oral magnesium which can make replacement by mouth difficult but dividing the dose to 3-4 times a day is better tolerated. Severe deficits of potassium and magnesium require intravenous replacement. If low blood potassium levels are not sufficiently replaced with replacement by mouth, aldosterone antagonists (such as spironolactone or eplerenone) or epithelial sodium channel blockers such as amiloride can be used to decrease urinary wasting of potassium.\n\nIn patients with early onset of the disease such as infants and children, indomethacin is the drug of choice utilized to treat growth disturbances. Indomethacin in a study by Blanchard et. al 2015 was shown to increase serum potassium levels, and decrease renin concentration. Adverse effects of indomethacin include a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, and gastrointestinal distrubances.\n\nCardiac evaluation is promoted in the prevention of dysrhythmias and monitoring of QT interval activity. Medications that extend or prolong the QT interval (macrolides, antihistamines,beta-2 agonists) should be avoided in these patients to prevent cardiac death.\n\nGitelman syndrome is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 in 40,000 homozygous people . The ratio of men to women affected is 1:1. This disease is encountered typically past the 1st decade of life, during adolescence or adulthood but can occur in the neonatal period. Heterozygous carriers of the SLC12A3 gene mutations are 1% of the population. Parents with Gitelman syndrome have a low probability of passing the disorder to their offspring roughly 1 in 400 unless they are both carriers of the disease.\n\nThe condition is named for Hillel J. Gitelman (1932– January 12, 2015), an American nephrologist working at University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He first described the condition in 1966, after observing a pair of sisters with the disorder. Gitelman and his colleagues later identified and isolated the gene responsible (\"SLC12A3\") by molecular cloning.\n"}

They are found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. The three species are in two genera.\n\nThe body tends to be brown with dark markings in the upper half. These markings disappear as they mature. Their needle-like teeth are highly adapted for impaling fish, their main prey. Their teeth are long, narrow, and very sharp with smooth edges, with one and on occasion two smaller cusplets on either side. Sand sharks have a large second dorsal fin. The sand shark can grow up to long, and most adults can weigh around . The average lifespan of both sexes is only about 7 years, though they may live longer in captivity.\n\nThe name sand shark comes from their tendency to migrate towards shoreline habitats, and they are often seen swimming around the ocean floor in the surf zone; at times, they come very close to shore. They are often found in warm or temperate waters throughout the world's oceans, except the eastern Pacific. They also frequent the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas at depths from and sometimes more.\n\nThe sand shark has a unique hunting strategy. It is able to gulp air from above the surface and collect the air in its stomach. This enables it to become buoyant and approach its prey virtually motionless. During the day, the sand shark stays mostly inactive, but at night, it becomes active and resumes hunting activities. Its staple is small fish, but it eats crustaceans and squid, as well. It occasionally hunts in shivers (groups), and has even been known to attack full fishing nets.\n\nSand sharks only develop two embryos, one in each uterus. The largest and strongest embryos consume their siblings in the womb (intrauterine cannibalism) before each surviving pup is born. It has one of the lowest reproduction rates of all sharks and is susceptible to even minimal population pressure, so it is listed as vulnerable and is protected in much of its range.\n\nSand sharks are not known to attack humans. If a person were to provoke a sand shark, it may retaliate defensively. Sand sharks are generally not aggressive, but harass divers who are spearfishing. In North America, wreck divers regularly visit the World War II shipwrecks to dive with the sharks that make the wrecks their home.\n\nA recent report from the PEW Charitable Trusts suggests a new management approach used for large mammals that have suffered population declines could hold promise for sharks. Because of the life-history characteristics of sharks, conventional fisheries management approaches, such as reaching maximum sustainable yield, may not be sufficient to rebuild depleted shark populations. Some of the more stringent approaches used to reverse declines in large mammals may be appropriate for sharks, including prohibitions on the retention of the most vulnerable species and regulation of international trade.\n\nThe family contains three extant species, in two genera, as well as many extinct species in several genera.\n\n"}

According to Elaine Showalter, gynocritics is the study of not only the female as a gender status but also the 'internalized consciousness' of the female. The uncovering of the female subculture and exposition of a female model is the intention of gynocriticism, comprising recognition of a distinct female canon where a female identity is sought free from the masculine definitions and oppositions.\n\nGynocriticism accordingly challenged a Freudian psychoanalytic perspective whereby the female inherently suffers envy of men and feelings of inadequacy and injustice, combined with feelings of intellectual inferiority. Arguing that male 'phallic prejudice' itself creates a female consciousness that demands a critique, and that prejudice against the female incites a specific noesis that gets attributed to the female, Gynocriticism stressed that this prejudice has concealed the female literary tradition to the point of imitating the masculine.\n\nGynocriticism helped reclaim from obscurity a vast body of early female writings, often published in Virago, as well as producing such feminist classics as \"The Madwoman in the Attic\". However its very successes left it open to new challenges from within feminism. Poststructuralists complained that it fetishized the role of the author, at the expense of the reader and the text, and that its grand narrative, setting up a female canon in opposition to the male, was essentialist, and omitted differences and divisions among women, leaving out lesbians and women of color, for example.\n\nRace, class, social interest, political inclination, religion and sexuality all arguably come into play in the construction of identity. Separating out such properties would create a one-dimensional view of the female, yet if gender and identity are merely constructs then it becomes difficult to assign any inherent qualities of nature or language to found a critique.\n\nDespite such limitations, gynocriticism offers a valuable interrogation of 'female' literature, through the study of sameness and difference in gender. While the term is rarely used in third-wave feminism, the \"practices\" and canon establishment of gynocriticism continues to underpin feminist literary criticism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1999434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999434", "title": "The Last Ninja (series)", "text": "The Last Ninja (series)\n\nThe Last Ninja is a series of video games published by System 3. The first game in the series, titled \"The Last Ninja\", was released in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and was one of the most successful games for the system. In 1988, System 3 released \"Last Ninja 2\", and in 1991 the third game in the series, \"Last Ninja 3\". In 1990, \"Last Ninja Remix\" was released for 8-bit systems. This was \"Last Ninja 2\" with new music, a new introductory sequence, slightly changed graphics (most notably the screen border) and fixed bugs. Confusingly, the 16-bit versions of the original \"The Last Ninja\" game were also released in 1990 as \"Ninja Remix\".\n\nThe protagonist of \"The Last Ninja\" series is Armakuni, the sole survivor of a ninjutsu clan that was destroyed by an evil shogun named Kunitoki. This struggle leads our hero to the island of Lin Fen (in the first \"Last Ninja\") to modern day New York City (in \"Last Ninja 2\") and to the mystical Buddhist temple in Tibet (in \"Last Ninja 3\"). In each of the games, Kunitoki is the final adversary and every time eludes death after a somewhat decisive victory from Armakuni.\n\nEach game is divided into a number of self-contained locations, with the original game containing six such 'levels'. Each level is loaded separately, in sequence as the game progresses. Game over takes the player back to the start of the current level. Each location was presented as a map of static isometric screens, with the player's character restricted to predefined paths (the scenery was inaccessible). By 8-bit standards, the graphics were very detailed, and on many platforms the screen would take a second or so to draw itself when entered.\n\nThe gameplay generally consisted of fighting, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Movement and fighting was done on the joystick, and the keyboard was used to select items and weapons that the player had to acquire. The player could select one active weapon and one item at any given time. Many map screens contained opponents which the ninja could avoid (by exiting a screen before they caught him) or fight using his selected weapon. (In later \"Last Ninja\" games defeated enemies would revive after a certain amount of time.) Items would flash briefly when a screen was first entered, and could be picked up when standing close to them, usually triggering a crouching animation that was also often employed when using the object. Most of the puzzles were of the item-finding or precision-jumping variety.\n\n\nGenerally the games had been made with Commodore 64 as the lead platform, with other platforms getting less attention (sometimes the porters didn't even receive the C64 version's data, and had to reconstruct the entire game from scratch). Versions of \"The Last Ninja\" for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Acorn Archimedes/RISC OS computers were published by Superior Software, while Activision published it for the Apple II.\n\nOne novel feature on the C64 version was the use of very distinctive oriental music in loading and in-game music for each level. These original music pieces on the first \"Last Ninja\" were composed by C64 musician Ben Daglish doing five tunes and Anthony Lees doing six tunes. In the sequel, \"Last Ninja 2\", Matt Gray composed all the tunes. What separated \"The Last Ninja\" series from most other games was that in C64 version all three SID sound channels were dedicated to music playback, meaning that there were no in-game sounds. Reyn Ouwehand provided the new music used in the C64 version of \"Last Ninja Remix\".\n\nIn 1993, John Wells created a series of previews, music and a map for one level of a fourth game which he tried to convince System 3 to make. System 3 turned him down.\n\nOriginally set for an early 2004 release, a new \"Last Ninja\" game was shown at the E3 2003 Expo in Los Angeles, but has since been delayed. Released screenshots showed a game looking very similar to Tecmo's \"Ninja Gaiden\", also in development at the time (released in early 2004). \"Retro Gamer\" reported they \"that Play It is to release the original \"Last Ninja\" trilogy on PS2. The graphics will be enhanced, but the gameplay and puzzles will remain intact. Again, this will be released in the next few months and priced at a very economical £10. It will also serve as a perfect appetiser for the fully 3D’d up \"Last Ninja 4\", due out next year.\" A new game has also been said to be cancelled at least three times, only to return to development. In 2007, System 3 CEO, Mark Cale, said the fourth \"Last Ninja\" was scrapped because it \"simply wasn't good enough\" and stated that \"Last Ninja\" would be returning in the form of a remade trilogy for Nintendo DS and Wii. Cale said: \"We’ve scrapped the fourth game. I felt it wasn’t representative of the market. For \"Last Ninja 4\", I think you need to do something that recreates that kind of ‘wow’ factor of the original game, and in my mind it wasn’t good enough to wear that badge – so why cash in on a great name? We may as well leave it as it is. There will definitely be a fourth game. It’ll either be a retro version with updated graphics but the same gameplay, or something that’s going to be an epic, like a \"Final Fantasy\" game but with a more arcade feel.\"\n\nIn 2010, GamePro included Armakuni in their article \"Top Ten video game ninjas\" (\"If Rambo had been born in Feudal Japan, he’d be a lot like Armakuni\"). Virgin Media included him on the list of top ten video game ninja heroes, however commenting the series itself \"hasn't aged all that gracefully\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1999474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999474", "title": "Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)", "text": "Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)\n\nProgressive revelation is a core teaching in the Baháʼí Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Baháʼí teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Baháʼu'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.\n\nThis teaching is an interaction of simpler teachings and their implications. The basic concept relates closely to Baháʼí views on God's essential unity, and the nature of prophets, termed Manifestations of God. It also ties into Baháʼí views of the purpose and nature of religion, laws, belief, culture and history. Hence revelation is seen as both progressive and continuous, and therefore never ceases.\n\nBaháʼís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God. Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion. This process of revelation, according to the Baháʼí writings, is also never ceasing, which is contrary to many other belief systems that believe in a finality of their prophet/messenger. The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one. The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the \"conditions\" and \"varying requirements of the age\" and the \"spiritual capacity\" of humanity. These differences are seen to be needed since human society has slowly and gradually evolved through higher stages of unification from the family to tribes and then nations.\n\nThus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger. In the Baháʼí view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extent to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, explained that the appearance of successive messengers was like the annual coming of Spring, which brings new life to the world which has come to neglect the teachings of the previous messenger. He also used an analogy of the world as the human body, and revelation as a robe of \"justice and wisdom\".\n\nWhenever this robe hath fulfilled its purpose, the Almighty will assuredly renew it. For every age requireth a fresh measure of the light of God. Every Divine Revelation hath been sent down in a manner that befitted the circumstances of the age in which it hath appeared.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh mentioned in the \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" that God will renew the \"City of God\" about every thousand years, and specifically mentioned that a new Manifestation of God would not appear within 1000 years of Baháʼu'lláh's message.\n\nMuhammad, Jesus, Moses, and Zoroaster were all named by Baháʼu'lláh as being among the establishers of religion, termed Manifestations of God, as well as himself, and his forerunner the Báb. Baháʼu'lláh also expressly or implicitly referred to Adam, Noah, Saleh, Húd, and an unnamed prophet of the Sabians as messengers of God. Bahà'u'llàh's works that exist today never mentioned Buddha or Krishna as manifestations, but his son 'Abdu'l-Bahà mentioned in his own works that Buddha and Krishna were indeed manifestations of God.\n\nIn addition to the idea of religion being progressively revealed from the same God through different prophets/messengers, there also exists in Baháʼí literature, the idea of a universal cycle, which represents a series of dispensations, and is used to categorize human history and social evolution in a number of ways. It is viewed as a superset of the sequence of progressive revelations, and currently comprises two cycles.\n\nThe \"Adamic cycle\", also known as the \"Prophetic cycle\" is stated to have begun approximately 6,000 years ago with a Manifestation of God referred to in various sacred scriptures as Adam, and ended with the dispensation of Muhammad. In this cycle, Baháʼí belief is that Manifestations of God continued to advance human civilization at regular intervals through progressive revelation. The Abrahamic religions and Dharmic religions are partial recognitions of this cycle, from a Baháʼí point of view.\n\nIn Baháʼí belief, the \"Baháʼí cycle\", or \"Cycle of Fulfillment\", began with the Báb and includes Baháʼu'lláh, and will last at least five hundred thousand years with numerous Manifestations of God appearing throughout that time. It is stated in Baháʼí literature that the Manifestations of God in the \"Adamic cycle\", in addition to bringing their own teachings, foretold of the \"Cycle of Fulfillment\".\n\nThe concept of progressive revelation is further explained in the Baháʼí writings in numerous metaphors. These metaphors include the daily and seasonal cycle and the progression through a school.\n\nThe coming of each new messenger and the teachings they bring is compared to the coming of Spring, as the teachings bring new life to the world made spiritually dead and cold because the teachings of the previous messenger have been neglected. The coming of the messenger is also described through the metaphor of daily cycle of the sun. The appearance of the Manifestation of God is here likened to the rise of the spiritual sun. The teachings of this messenger then extend and deepen towards noon and afternoon but as the sun sets the teachings are not as visible.\n\nThe earliest forms of religion are seen, in many of the Baháʼí Writings, to be like early school. In this view humanity, like a child, has been maturing while gaining a greater ability to grasp complex ideas as it grows in years and progresses in school. Each time a divine messenger appears, the message given is suited to humanity's degree of maturation. In this view each religion may explain truth differently according to the needs of the recipients of the teachings. Baháʼu'lláh was asked several questions about the nature of differences in religions, God's messengers, and religious laws. His response was a reference to progressive revelation:\n\nThe All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.\n\nBaháʼís believe that religious teachings are of two varieties: essential spiritual truth, and ephemeral social constructs. The latter may include laws of conduct, diet, institutions, ceremonies, and treatment of criminals. These may change dramatically from messenger to messenger. The former, however, are essential and do not change, except perhaps in their cultural presentation. So the Manifestation of God is seen as at once restoring the essential truth, returning the faithful to the correct practice. Simultaneously, the Manifestation eliminates redundant or corrupt social structures and creates such social organization as will support the improvement of mankind.\n\nBaháʼís accept the founders of the \"major world religions\" as Manifestations of God. The usual list Baháʼís commonly refer to include Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster (Zarathustra), Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and Baháʼu'lláh. In addition to the Manifestations of God, the Baháʼí writings include a category of lesser prophets who reflect the light of the Manifestations, but are not independent divine intermediaries; there is no definitive list of lesser prophets.\n\nThe Baháʼí writings also refer to some other figures who are not well known, or whose religions have all but disappeared. Furthermore, the existence of unnumbered previous religions of which we have no modern knowledge is confirmed by Shoghi Effendi:\n\nBaháʼu'lláh's seminal \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" (in English, \"The Book of Certitude\") is probably the best original description of the Baháʼí view of progressive revelation. In it Baháʼu'lláh describes the relationships between several Abrahamic prophets and how each accepted the previous, but was rejected by the previous prophet's followers. He uses these examples to highlight the legitimacy of the Báb to the reader, since the book was written in answer to some questions from the Báb's uncle. The work, however, establishes the core teaching of the Baháʼí Faith and is seen as being of more general applicability.\n\n\n\n"}

He rented the Selby Theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota for $100 a month and began to build his own company. He ran the theater almost completely by himself, expanding to 25 venues within a few years.\n\nMann sold the theaters to General Cinema Corporation (founded by Philip Smith and then led by Richard A. Smith) in 1970 and moved to California. The first production to his credit was 1969's \"The Illustrated Man\", based on a Ray Bradbury book. He didn't stay out of the theater business for long, and purchased the troubled 276-screen National General Theatre chain in 1973. Mann soon expanded the chain to 360 screens, but again sold off his theaters in 1986, this time to Gulf+Western, which later renamed itself to Paramount Communications (which itself became part of Viacom). Grauman's Theater eventually regained its original name in late 2001.\n\nBoth the Orpheum and Pantages venues of today's \"Hennepin Theatre District\" in Minneapolis were once owned by Mann. He eventually owned at least six theaters in the city's downtown region. The Ted Mann Concert Hall at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis is named for him.\n\nOn June 24, 1934, Ted Mann married Ida Charon (1911–1997). Before their divorce, Ted and Ida Mann had two daughters, Victoria Mann Sims and Roberta Lynn Mann-Benson (died 2010). He married actress Rhonda Fleming in 1977, and they remained together until Mann died at age 84 in Los Angeles of complications from a stroke. Upon his death he was survived by, in addition to Fleming, two daughters, a sister Edythe, two grandsons, and two granddaughters.\n\n\n"}

She was the founder of Lesbian Feminist Liberation, one of the first lesbian activist groups in the women's movement, and an early member and co-director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. She co-founded National Coming Out Day.\n\nBefore becoming a lesbian and gay rights activist she was a Roman Catholic religious sister. She would later write about her experience in a 1985 anthology, \"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence\".\n\nO'Leary was born in Kingston, New York, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1966, just out of high school, she entered the novitiate of the Sisters of the Humility of Mary, of Villa Maria, PA, in order to \"have an impact on the world\". In 1971, after graduating from Cleveland State University with a degree in psychology, she left the convent before completing the period of training.\n\nIn 1971 O'Leary moved to New York City and did doctoral studies in organization development at Yeshiva University. As a lesbian during this period, she became involved with the nascent gay rights movement, joining the Gay Activists' Alliance (GAA) Chapter in Brooklyn and later lobbying state politicians. In 1972, feeling that it was too dominated by the men of the movement, she left the GAA and founded Lesbian Feminist Liberation, one of the first lesbian activist groups in the women's movement. Two years later, she joined the National Gay Task Force, negotiating gender parity in its executive with director Bruce Voeller, joining as co-executive director.\n\nIn 1977 O'Leary organized the first meeting of gay rights activists at the White House through arrangements made with White House staffer Midge Costanza. She was the first openly gay person appointed to a presidential commission, the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year, by Jimmy Carter. In this role she negotiated for gay and lesbian rights to be included on the discussion in a conference marking the year in Houston, Texas.\n\nO'Leary was among three openly gay delegates to the United States Democratic Party convention in 1976. She also served on the Democratic National Committee for 12 years, 8 of those on the executive committee.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, O'Leary focused on building National Gay Rights Advocates, then one of the largest national gay and lesbian rights groups. It was one of the first to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic's implications for legal and civil liberties, using aggressive litigation to ensure AIDS patients' access to treatment.\n\nShe co-founded National Coming Out Day with Rob Eichberg in 1987.\n\nIn a speech given at the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day, O'Leary read a statement on behalf of 100 women that read, in part, \"We support the right of every person to dress in the way that she or he wishes. But we are opposed to the exploitation of women by men for entertainment or profit.\" In response, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster, both self-identified drag queens, jumped onstage and responded, \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and \"these bitches\" tell us to quit being ourselves!\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, O'Leary and other gay liberation activists did not actively include all transsexuals and transvestites in proposed gay rights legislation, largely due to the belief that this would make basic legislation too difficult to pass at the time. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\" \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"\n\nO'Leary was referring to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.\n\nShe and her partner, Lisa Phelps, had a daughter (Victoria) and a son (David de Maria).\n\nO'Leary died on June 4, 2005, in San Clemente, California, of lung cancer, aged 57.\n\nSeason 2, episodes 4 and 5 of the podcast \"Making Gay History\" are about her.\n"}
{"id": "1999484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999484", "title": "Seed ball", "text": "Seed ball\n\nSeed balls, also known as \"earth balls\" or , consist of a variety of different seeds rolled within a ball of clay, preferably volcanic pyroclastic red clay. Various additives may be included, such as humus or compost. These are placed around the seeds, at the center of the ball, to provide microbial inoculants. Cotton-fibres or liquefied paper are sometimes mixed into the clay in order to strengthen it, or liquefied paper mash coated on the outside to further protect the clay ball during sowing by throwing, or in particularly harsh habitats.\n\nThe technique for creating seed balls was rediscovered by Japanese natural farming pioneer Masanobu Fukuoka. The technique was also used, for instance, in ancient Egypt to repair farms after the annual spring flooding of the Nile. In modern times, during the period of the Second World War, this Japanese government plant scientist working in a government lab, Fukuoka, who lived on the mountainous island of Shikoku, wanted to find a technique that would increase food production without taking away from the land already allocated for traditional rice production which thrived in the volcanic rich soils of Japan.\n\nTo make a seed ball, generally about five measures of red clay by volume are combined with one measure of seeds. The balls are formed between 10mm and 80mm (about 0.4 to 3.15 inches) in diameter. After the seed balls have been formed, they must dry for 24-48 hours before use.\n\nSeed bombing is the practice of introducing vegetation to land by throwing or dropping seed balls.\nIt was made popular by green movements such as guerrilla gardening as a way to practice active reforestation.\n\nSeed balls were also experimentally used in aerial seeding in Kenya in 2016. This was an attempt to improve the yield of standard aerial seeding.\n\nAerial seeding (or aerial reforestation) is the technique of spreading seeds from an airplane, helicopter or a similar flying transport. \nIt can be considered a particular type of direct seeding: as such, it introduces seeds directly in the field and it is often not economical due to the issues of germination, pests and seed predation by rodents or other wild animals. Transplanting seedlings from a plant nursery to the field is a more effective sowing technique.\n\nAerial seeding has a low yield and require 25% to 50% more seeds than drilled seeding to achieve the same results. It is sometimes used as a technique to plant cover crops without having to wait for the main crop's off-season.\nThe earliest attempts at aerial reforestation date back to the 1930s. In this period, planes were used to distribute seeds over certain inaccessible mountains in Honolulu after forest fires. \nThese experiments were largely unsuccessful, because of poor seed dispersal: seeds failed to obtain enough kinetic energy to enter the soil and as a result were massively predated. This in turn generated an infestation of rodents in Hawaii.\n\nThe use of seed balls, instead of simple seeds, to perform aerial reforestation in Kenya seems to have produced desirable results. Chardust Ltd, the company involved and distributing seed balls for that project, claims to have sold and distributed over 7 million seedballs, as per August 2019. It is likely, though, that the majority of these seed balls are deployed traditionally instead than via aerial seeding and there is no published data to support the benefits of using seed balls via aerial seeding.\n\nIn 1987, Lynn Garrison proposed the creation of a Haitian Aerial Reforestation Project (HARP), by which tons of seed would be scattered from specially modified aircraft. The seeds would be encapsulated in an absorbent material. This coating would contain fertilizer, insecticide/animal repellent and, perhaps a few vegetable seeds. Haiti has a bimodal rainy season, with precipitation in spring and fall. The seeds could have been moistened a few days before the drop, to start germination. Unfortunately the project never came to fruition.\n\nAnother more recent project idea was to use saplings instead of seeds in aerial. \nSaplings would be encased in sturdy and biodegradable containers which would work as projectiles and pierce the ground at high velocity. This would likely guarantee a better yield when compared to simple aerial seeding or even seed bombing.\n\nThis project was being developed in 1999 by a company called Aerial Reforestation Inc, in Newton, Massachusetts, based on an original idea by pilot Jack Walters. The company was planning to use military transport aircraft C-130, traditionally used to lay out landmines on combat fields. \nAs per 2019 the company does not seem to be operating anymore. \n\nOther researchers are still investigating the potential of these \"aerial sapling darts\", by improving their aerodynamics to achieve better soil penetration and therefore higher reforestation yields. More research is needed to assess exactly their performance against other reforestation methods.\n\nThe most recent attempt at Seed Bombing is performed by DroneSeed, a company that has become operative in 2019. \nThey claim to have devised a proprietary seed bomb that is able to deter animals from eating the seeds and, by using a mix of different seeds in the same bomb, to maximize the yield of the tree planting operations. \nGiven the focus of this company on disaster relief, they have considered sapling darts not to be an effective solution since \"nursery suppliers lack capacity to reforest after sizeable wildfires — especially repeat fires.\" \n\nDespite its low yield, interest in aerial seeding has recently grown, while searching for a quick system to obtain reforestation and fight global warming. \nThe advantage of using an airplane/helicopter is the ability to quickly seed large areas, even remote areas, otherwise impractical to be used in active reforestation.\n\nAerial seeding is therefore best suited to sites whose remoteness, ruggedness, inaccessibility, or sparse population make seedling planting difficult. It is particularly appropriate for \"protection forests\" because helicopters or planes can easily spread seed over steep slopes or remote watersheds and isolated dryland areas. \nIt seems also well suited for use in areas where there may be a dearth of skilled laborers, supervisors, and funds for reforestation. It has the potential to help increase production of tree crops for forage, food, and honey as well as wood for fuel, posts, lumber, charcoal and pulp.\n\nSeed balls and aerial reforestation are heavily sensitive to environmental conditions. Seeds deployment may not be practical in some cases because the site may require preparation or the season may be wrong.\nTo germinate successfully, seeds usually must fall directly onto mineral soil rather than onto established vegetation or undecomposed organic matter. Where organic matter has accumulated thickly, the site must normally be burned, furrowed, or disked. The soil disturbance left after logging is often sufficient. \nRough terrain is more amenable to broadcast seeding, but yields are typically low even in the best conditions.\n\nOn certain sites ground preparation may be necessary. Site preparation and the seeding operation must be well coordinated to meet the biological requirements for prompt seed germination and seeding survival. Dry sites may have to be specially ridged or disked so as to optimize the rainfall that reaches the seed. Excessively wet sites may need to be ridged or drained.\n\nThe degree of field slope is not critical as long as seeds find a receptive seedbed. Steep watersheds, eroding mountain slopes, bare hillsides, and spoil-banks where vegetation is sparse are often suitable for aerial seeding (however, on some steep slopes with smooth, bare soil, rain may wash the seeds away too easily for successful seeding).\n\nArid and savanna lands (for example, those where annual rainfall is under 800 mm) are most in need of reforestation. These are regions where aerial seeding in principle has exceptional potential. They include vast tracts of unused or poorly used land that has sparse tree cover and that is not confined to private land holdings, so it is generally accessible to aircraft. The native trees (such as species of Acacia, and other genera) in these areas are generally well adapted for survival under difficult field conditions. These are not species for timber as much as for firewood, forage, fruit, gum, erosion control, and other such uses.\n\nAs a prerequisite to any method of reforestation, the species selected must be adapted to the temperature, length of growing season, rainfall, humidity, photoperiod, and other environmental features of the area. Ideally, before aerial seeding takes place trial plots should be established to test those species most likely to germinate and grow successfully on the chosen sites. Even when one species has the right characteristics, it may be prudent to test seed of different provenances to find those best suited to the site.\n\nCharacteristics that make a particular species more or less appropriate for aerial seeding include:\n\nSpecies with highly palatable seeds have little prospect of success because wildlife eat the seed before it has a chance to germinate unless it is pelletized. Also, small seeds and lightweight, chaffy seeds are more likely to drift in the wind, so they are harder to target during the drop. Small seeds, however, fall into crevices and are then more likely to get covered with soil, thereby enhancing their chances of survival.\nAerial seeding may prove to work best with \"pioneer\" species, which germinate rapidly on open sites, are adapted for growth on bare or disturbed areas, and grow well in direct sunlight.\n\nIt is the most common method and the one practiced by Farmland Aviation, Kenya, one of the few companies active in this field. They claim to be able to spread up to six tons of tree seeds per hour over tens of thousands of acres.\n\nUntil recently (2017), drones were not used in aerial seeding. Low-cost UAV's lacked payload capacity and range limits them for most aerial seeding applications. A drone developed by Parrot SA and BioCarbon Engineering however has solved this issue. It is capable of dropping 100 000 pods a day.\n\nThis deployment method is being tested in Kenya and holds promises of great reforestation rates because of low cost, low speed and altitudes, even if seed spraying rate is likely to be much slower than deployment by aircraft.\n\nThe term \"seed green-aide\" was first used by Liz Christy in 1973 when she started the \"Green Guerrillas\". The first seed green-aides were made from condoms filled with tomato seeds, and fertilizer. They were tossed over fences onto empty lots in New York City in order to make the neighborhoods look better. It was the start of the guerrilla gardening movement.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1999493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999493", "title": "Manifestation of God", "text": "Manifestation of God\n\nThe Manifestation of God ( \"maẓhar ẓohūr\") is a concept in the Baháʼí Faith that refers to what are commonly called prophets. The Manifestations of God are appearances of the Divine Spirit or Holy Spirit in a series of personages, and as such, they perfectly reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization through the agency of that same Spirit. In the Baha'i Faith, it is believed that the Manifestations of God are the only channel for humanity to know about God because contact with the Spirit is what transforms the heart and mind, creating a living relationship between the soul and God. They act as perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God into the physical world. Baháʼí teachings hold that the motive force in all human development is due to the coming of the Manifestations of God. The Manifestations of God are directly linked with the Baháʼí concept of progressive revelation.\n\nThe Baháʼí concept of the intermediary between God and humanity is expressed in the term Manifestation of God. Baháʼís believe in a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose. Baháʼís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as Manifestations of God. In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God as God cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Baháʼí concept of a Manifestation of God emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man. A common Baháʼí analogy used to explain the relationship between the Manifestation of God and God is that of a perfect mirror. In the analogy, God is likened to the Sun – the source of physical life on earth. The spirit and attributes of God are likened to the rays of the Sun, and the Manifestations of God are likened to perfect mirrors reflecting the rays of the Sun. Thus, the Manifestations of God act as pure mirrors that reflect the attributes of God onto this material world.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are seen to represent a level of existence which is an intermediary between God and humans. Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, explained that at one extreme the Manifestations of God are humble servants of God and at the other extreme they claim to speak with the voice of God, and manifest his attributes to humanity. They may at times emphasize their humanity, and at other times proclaim their divinity. These stations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are believed to possess capacities that do not exist in humans, and this difference is not a difference in degree but a difference in kind. The Manifestations of God are not seen to be simply great thinkers or philosophers who have a better understanding than others, but that, by their nature, they are inherently superior to the average human. Thus, the Manifestations of God are special beings, having a unique relationship to God as they have been sent by God from the spiritual world as an instrument of divine revelation. They are understood to have existed in the spiritual world prior to their physical birth in this life. They are also seen to have innate, divinely revealed knowledge and absolute knowledge of the physical world. According to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son and successor of the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, the Manifestations of God must be distinguished above any other person in every aspect and qualification, in order that they can effectively train and educate people.\n\nThe purpose of the Manifestation of God, according to Baháʼí belief, is to educate humanity. The Manifestations of God are seen as divine educators, who are raised up by God with the purpose of uplifting mankind and expressing his will. In expressing God's intent, the Manifestations of God are seen to establish religion in the world. Each brings a book and reveals teachings and laws according to the time and place which they appear. Baháʼu'lláh used the term \"revelation\" to describe the phenomena that occurs each time a Manifestation of God appears; he stated that the writings of the Manifestation of God represent the infallible word of God, and because the writings remain after the earthly life of the Manifestation they are a very important part of revelation. The laws and precepts revealed by the Manifestation of God lie in different spheres and levels and include elements intended to help individuals develop a sound character and acquire divine attributes, as well as laws and principles designed to help improve the welfare of society and advance civilization. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá has stated that from time to time an educator will come to teach humanity, and without these teachings humanity would be overcome by such emotions and attitudes as anger, jealousy and hatred.\n\nThe Baháʼí belief that the primary role of the Manifestation of God is that of an educator is stated by Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá:\n\nIn Baháʼí belief, all of the Manifestations of God are from the same God and have the same spiritual and metaphysical nature, and that there is absolute equality among them. The differences between the various Manifestations of God and their teachings, Baháʼu'lláh explained, are due to the varying needs and capacities of the civilization in which they appeared, and not due to any differences in their level of importance or nature.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are taught to be \"one and the same\", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. Baháʼu'lláh wrote in the \"Book of Certitude\" that in respect to their station of unity \"if thou callest them all by one name and dost ascribe to them the same attribute, thou hast not erred from the truth.\" In this sense, the Manifestations of God all fulfill the same purpose and perform the same function by mediating between God and creation. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Baháʼu'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual \"return\" of all the previous Manifestations of God.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh then states the diversity of the teachings of the Manifestations of God does not come about because of their differences, since they are one and the same, but because they each have a different mission. Baháʼu'lláh writes regarding this station of distinction, \"each Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined Revelation, and specially designated limitations.\" Baháʼu'lláh wrote in the \"Gems of Divine Mysteries\" that those who perceive distinctions and differences between the Manifestations of God, will notice the underlying unity of the Manifestations once they continue on their spiritual path. Baháʼu'lláh in several passages goes so far as to say that denial of one Manifestation is equivalent to denial of all of them. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá said that a Baháʼí will choose death over denial of any of the great Prophets, whether Moses, Muhammad or Christ.\n\nThe Baháʼí belief in the oneness of the Manifestations of God does not mean, however, that the same individual soul is born again at different times and in different physical bodies. In the Baháʼí view, the various Manifestations of God were all different personalities and had separate individual realities. Instead, their equality is due to that Manifestation of God manifested and revealed the qualities of God to the same degree.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh taught that Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single progressive religion from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress. In the Baháʼí view the succession of Manifestations of God had no beginning and will have no end. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that Manifestations will continue to come about every thousand years, extending \"over many ages into the unborn reaches of time.\"\n\nWhile Manifestations of God are explained to have always come to humanity and will continue to do so, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá explained that there are distinct cycles within this process. The cycles consist of hundreds of thousands of years and are characterized by three periods. The first period involves the coming of a series of Manifestations of God who prepare humanity for a universal theophany; the second period involves the appearance of the Manifestation of God that brings the universal theophany and his dispensation; finally the third period includes the Manifestations of God that come after. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá stated that in the current cycle, the first period was started by Adam and extended to the time of the Báb. Baháʼu'lláh is seen as the universal Manifestation of God, and the current cycle will continue for another 500,000 years.\n\nThere is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include Adam, Noah, Krishna, Moses, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. The Báb, as well as Baháʼu'lláh, were included in this definition. Thus religious history is interpreted as a series of periods or \"dispensations\", where each \"Manifestation\" brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.\n\nBaháʼís do not claim that the Baháʼí revelation is the final stage in God's direction in the course of human spiritual evolution. The Baháʼí writings contain assurances that after 1000 years of Baháʼu'lláh's coming, another Manifestation of God will appear to advance human civilization.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá writes in the \"Tablet of the Universe\" (\"\"Lawh-i-Aflákiyyih\"\") that there are infinite Manifestations of God in the infinite worlds of God.\n\nIn the Baháʼí definition, there is a distinction between minor prophets and the Manifestations of God, the major prophets. This distinction is also referred to as lesser/greater, dependent/independent, follower/universal, and other similar phrases. The Manifestations of God or the major prophets are compared to the sun, which produces its own heat and light, and the minor prophets are likened to the moon, which receives its light from the sun.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are described as prophets endowed with constancy. The term endowed with constancy refers to prophets to whom a book was revealed (in which the book contained legislation) and with whom lasting covenants with God were made, abrogating past covenants. For example, Baháʼu'lláh describes Moses as a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet; Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses (Exodus 4:14-17). Furthermore, the other prophets of the Old Testament such as Jeremiah, David, Solomon, Ezekiel, and Isaiah are described as minor prophets as they came in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion. There is, however, no definite list of who is or isn't a minor prophet in the Baháʼí understanding.\n\nThe distinction can also be described as the difference between inspiration and revelation. Revelation is seen to be the direct and infallible perception of God's word and is only accessible to the Manifestations of God who transmit it to humanity. On the other hand, inspiration is seen to be the indirect and relative perception of spiritual truths that each person may have access to. Baháʼu'lláh stated that at times, God chooses ordinary people to act as \"prophets\" and thus inspires them to play certain roles in human affairs; these people however remain ordinary people whose powers of inspiration have been further developed by God.\n\nIt is implied, though not specifically named, that the American continents have had their share of divine revelations, which somewhat have been lost to time except in oral traditions. A quote exists by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá:\n\nAcademics are researching Native Messengers and some have connected the signs of a Prophet with the Great Peacemaker of the Haudenosaunee. As such, some Baháʼí's revere the Peacemaker as a Manifestation of God. However, as the Great Peacemaker was never named specifically in the Writings, he cannot be officially listed as a Manifestation of God within the Faith.\n\nIn regards to the Asiatic prophets, Shoghi Effendi wrote:\n\n\n"}

Modeled after existing multi-sport organizations, GLISA’s members were international sporting federations, human rights organizations, continental associations representing sport teams and clubs from the major regions of the world, host cities of GLISA’s World OutGames, and other organizations that support the mandate of GLISA.\n\nGLISA expands LGBT rights by requiring that a human rights conference be included at every event sanctioned as an Outgames. In fact, the first worldOutgames in Montreal produced the Declaration of Montreal.\n\nRecent events stemming from the organization and subsequent cancellation of the 2016 Asia Pacific Outgames, 2016 North American Outgames and 2017 World Outgames. GLISA has failed to achieved this vision and has accomplished a lot to damage the greater LGBTQ+ Sports Community.

In 2003, the Federation of Gay Games (FGG) withdrew its sanction of Montreal, because of a dispute over the size of the event and demands of overall control of the Montreal 2006 budget by the FGG. Through an informal survey, Montreal found that several athletes and organizations were willing to participate in the event even if the FGG did not want to come to an agreement with the Montreal 2006 organizers. Montreal 2006, with support from its partners including the city of Montreal, the Province of Québec and the Federal government decided to go forward with the event. In order to create a legacy for the games—and a newly integrated concept: a human rights conference—Montreal 2006 organizers brought representatives from every continent to form an organization that would reflect the needs of the wider community. Out of this meeting of representatives sprung the Gay and Lesbian International \"Sport\" Association and a new sport, culture and human rights event: the World OutGames.\n\nGLISA licensed the first edition of the World Outgames to Montreal 2006.

Dennett says that, when the dualism is removed, what remains of Descartes' original model amounts to imagining a tiny theater in the brain where a homunculus (small person), now physical, performs the task of observing all the sensory data projected on a screen at a particular instant, making the decisions and sending out commands (cf. the homunculus argument).\n\nThe term \"Cartesian theater\" was brought up in the context of the multiple drafts model that Dennett posits in \"Consciousness Explained\" (1991):\n\n"}

He attended St Paul's School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied Sanskrit and the classics. In 1896, he achieved a first-class result in mods, and was awarded a Boden Scholarship in Sanskrit in 1897. He was given honorable mentions for the Hertford (1895), Ireland (1896) and Craven (1896) scholarships.\n\nClementi was \"proxime accessit\" (runner-up) for the Gaisford Greek Prose prize in 1897, and obtained his B.A. (2nd class \"lit. hum.\", i.e. classics) in 1898. Clementi was also \"proxime accessit\" for the Chancellor's Latin Essay prize in 1899, and obtained his M.A. in 1901.\n\nIn 1899, Clementi placed fourth in the competitive examinations for the civil service, which allowed him his choice of postings. His choice was Hong Kong, and upon his arrival he was sent up to Canton, where he was a land officer until forced to return to Hong Kong by the events of the Boxer Rebellion. Clementi's facility with languages was demonstrated when he passed the Cantonese examination in 1900, and the Pekingese examination six years later, in 1906.\n\nAfter serving as an Assistant Registrar General in 1901, Clementi joined as a member of the Board of Examiners in Chinese, in 1902. In 1902, Clementi was seconded for special service under government of India and was created J.P. in that same year. A year later, he was seconded for famine relief work in Kwangsi (Guangxi). A year afterwards, Clementi was appointed Member of Land Court, Assistant Land Officer and Police Magistrate at New Territories, Hong Kong, a position he served in until 1906.\n\nDue to his outstanding performance in the services, Clementi was promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Council, in 1907. While he was in that position, Clementi represented the Hong Kong government in the International Opium Conference at Shanghai, in 1909. A year later, he became the Private Secretary to the Administrator at that time, Sir Francis Henry May. Clementi eventually became Acting Colonial Secretary and Member of both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong. He would remain there until 1912.\n\nClementi played a part in the founding of the University of Hong Kong. Indeed, he wrote the words, in Latin, of the University Anthem, first performed 11 March 1912.\n\nIn 1913, Clementi was appointed Colonial Secretary of British Guiana, a post he held until 1922. From there he was named the Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, where he served until 1925. Each position imparted considerable responsibility, and on more than one occasion he was in charge of administering the entire government of his area of responsibility. Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1924.\n\nIn 1925, Clementi was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, a position to which his fluency in Cantonese suited him well and in which he served until 1930.\nDuring his tenure, the Canton–Hong Kong strike, which crippled the Hong Kong economy, was resolved and Kai Tak Airport entered operation (it would operate until Hong Kong International Airport opened and took over as the main airport in 1998). He also notably ended the practice of \"Mui Tsai\", the traditional Chinese \"female maid servitude\" system which often resulted in the abuse of young servant girls. He also appointed Shouson Chow, a prominent Chinese merchant, as the first unofficial member of the Executive Council. At the same time, he increased the numbers of official and non-official (\"Unofficial\") members in the Legislative Council from eight to ten (including the Governor) and from six to eight, respectively. He invited one Chinese and one Portuguese (Jose Pedro Braga) to be Unofficials.\n\nAfter his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong ended, Clementi went on to serve his last post in the Colonial Services as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements, which included Singapore, and High Commissioner for the Malay States, from 5 February 1930 to 17 February 1934. He handed over to Sir Andrew Caldecott, who become acting Governor, and left for England due to his illness. The position of Governor was later filled by Sir Shenton Thomas on 9 November 1934.\n\nSix years later, in 1940, Clementi became the Master of the Mercers' Company.\n\nClementi was the nephew of the Rt. Hon. Sir Cecil Clementi Smith (1860–1916), Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner in the period 1887 to 1893. He was also the great-grandson of the Italian-born musician Muzio Clementi.\n\nClementi married Marie Penelope Rose Eyres, daughter of Admiral Cresswell John Eyres, in 1912. The couple had one son, Cresswell, and three daughters.\n\nClementi died in High Wycombe, England, on 5 April 1947.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1999552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999552", "title": "Psychic driving", "text": "Psychic driving\n\nPsychic driving was a psychiatric procedure of the 1950s and 1960s in which patients were subjected to a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter their behaviour. In psychic driving, patients were often exposed to hundreds of thousands of repetitions of a single statement over the course of their treatment. They were also concurrently administered muscular paralytic drugs such as curare to subdue them for the purposes of exposure to the looped message(s). The procedure was pioneered by Dr. D. Ewen Cameron, and used and funded by the CIA's Project MKUltra program in Canada.\n\nThe psychic driving procedure was a chronological precursor to Cameron's \"depatterning\", the latter involving massive doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with similarly large doses of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD). The intent was to break down the subject's personality—theoretically \"psychic driving\" could then be used with some efficacy in establishing a new personality. In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure. Such biologically and psychologically devastating procedures, adopted internationally by the psychiatric establishment, were largely abolished by the time the CIA was brought before a Senate Hearing (1977) for its involvement and funding of Cameron's experimental activities—as part of the MKULTRA program. The topic of Cameron's psychic driving is dealt with in some detail in the docudrama entitled \"The Sleep Room\" (1998) directed by Anne Wheeler.\n\nSimilar techniques are alleged to have been used in the kidnapping and death of CIA operative William Francis Buckley by Aziz al-Abub, a medical doctor from Beirut who was seen as epitomizing medical torture. Aziz al-Abub, also known as Ibrahim al-Nadhir, was known for using his medical training to refine torture techniques. His techniques were shown to be closely connected to the CIA-developed torture techniques. As with the CIA, he used drugs to make it easier to handle those he tortured, carefully determined how long to keep a prisoner hooded and when to isolate them and other techniques seen as medical torture.\n\nInitially, in the hit NBC TV series \"Hannibal\", Dr. Chilton uses psychic driving on a patient of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Abel Gideon (played by Eddy Izzard), to convince him that he is the main antagonist of the series, the Chesapeake ripper. Later in the series psychic driving is alluded to by the main character Dr. Hannibal Lecter as a means to convince FBI profiler Will Graham that he has committed a string of brutal murders during a bout of encephalitis, to throw him off the trail and keep himself safe. Dr. Lecter uses psychic driving by purposely inducing trance-like states during therapy session, using Will Graham's encephalitis, then reinforcing his delusions that he has killed during episodes of lost time where he can't remember his own actions.\n\n\n"}

Between 2017 and 2018, she served as Minister for Economics and Energy in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel; she was the first woman to hold that office in German history.\n\nZypries had previously been Parliamentary State Secretary since December 2013, charged with the coordination of Germany's aviation and space policies. She was Federal Minister of Justice of Germany from 2002 to 2009 and State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior from 1998 to 2002.\n\nZypries studied law at the University of Giessen from 1972 to 1977, and took her first legal state exam in 1978. Then followed in-service training in the regional court district of Gießen, and in 1980 the second state exam. Until 1985 she worked at the University of Giessen.\n\n\nFollowing the 1998 federal elections, in the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Zypries became State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior under Otto Schily. From September 1999, she chaired the State Secretary Committee for the management of the Federal Government program \"Modern State – Modern Administration\".\n\nFollowing the 2002 federal elections, Zypries became Federal Minister of Justice in the second cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, succeeding Herta Däubler-Gmelin. Between 2007 and 2009, she was also one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state (\"Föderalismuskommission II\"), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.\n\nIn 2003, Zypries represented the German government before the Federal Constitutional Court when the Free Democratic Party challenged a German law allowing authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes. While law-enforcement officials and the government argue that the law helps fight organized crime and terrorism, opponents contend it violates constitutional privacy guarantees and has not allowed authorities to crack a single major case.\n\nIn 2005, the German government suffered a major setback in its efforts to combat terrorism after the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the country's implementation of the European Arrest Warrant was unconstitutional. The court said the EU idea was compatible with Germany's constitution, but that the law drafted by Zypries was sloppily written and did not go far enough in framing the leeway offered to prosecutors by the European Arrest Warrant. Just hours after the ruling, German police released terrorism suspect Mamoun Darkazanli, who had been held awaiting extradition to Spain where he is believed to have been linked to al-Qaida activities. When German economics minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg decided to outsource the drafting of new bankruptcy legislation in 2009, Zypries criticized that Guttenberg wasted taxpayers’ money and that it was the responsibility of her ministry, not his, to oversee the preparation of the legislation. In 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that a law requiring telecommunications companies to retain data from telephone, email and Internet traffic is unconstitutional; the law had been introduced by Zypries as implementation of an EU guideline.\n\nIn the negotiations to form a government following the 2005 federal elections, Zypries led the SPD's delegations in the working groups on justice, consumer protection, and internal affairs; her co-chairs from the CDU/CSU were Wolfgang Bosbach, Horst Seehofer and Wolfgang Schäuble, respectively.\n\nAfter German prosecutors had issued arrest warrants in 2007 for 13 suspected CIA operatives believed to have been involved in the abduction of Khaled el-Masri in Macedonia in late 2003 as well as in his being taken via Baghdad to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan in January 2004, Zypries soon decided not to further pursue the CIA agents. Though their names were still on an Interpol wanted persons list, the United States stated that it would not recognize its validity. Zypries explained that the US government had made clear to her that it would neither arrest nor hand over the agents. In the end, she concluded that, given the slim chances of success, it made no sense to even try to get them extradited.\n\nOn the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Zypries participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008.\n\nIn the case of Richard Williamson in 2009, Zypries said that the German government was willing to press charges against the bishop if he did not clearly retract his comments.\n\nIn 2009, Zypries led the resistance to the Google Books Library Project in Germany. In the daily \"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\", she accused Google of behaving in a \"simply unlawful\" way.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, Zypries served on the German Bundestag’s Committee on the Election of Judges (\"Wahlausschuss\"), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. From 2009, she was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG).\n\nAhead of the 2013 elections, Peer Steinbrück included Zypries in his shadow cabinet for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent Angela Merkel as chancellor. During the campaign, Zypries served as shadow minister for consumer protection. In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the elections, she led the SPD delegation in the working group on digital policy; her co-chair was Dorothee Bär of the CSU.\n\nFollowing the formation of the grand coalition in December 2013, Zypries was appointed Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. In January 2014, she became the government's coordinator for aviation and space policies.\n\nIn February 2014, Zypries accompanied German President Joachim Gauck on a state visit to India – where they met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, among others – and Myanmar.\n\nIn June 2016, Zypries announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.\n\nIn a cabinet reshuffle following the nomination of Frank-Walter Steinmeier as candidate for the federal presidency, Zypries was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy on 27 January 2017. She succeeded Sigmar Gabriel, who took the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs from Steinmeier.\n\nDuring her time in office, Zypries led the government's efforts to save Germany's then second-largest airline Air Berlin. When the company filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2017, she authorized a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations with Lufthansa continue.\n\nIn the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Zypries led the working group on economic affairs, alongside Thomas Strobl and Alexander Dobrindt.\n\nSince 2019, Zypries has been serving as ombudsperson for BDIU, the national association of Germany's credit management, debt collection and debt purchase sector.\n\n\n\nZypries is considered a proponent of regulating more tightly access to Internet platforms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple Inc.’s iTunes. A joint letter to the European Commission in November 2014, signed by Zypries and her French counterpart Axelle Lemaire on behalf of the German and French governments, suggested “essential” digital platforms should potentially be brought under existing rules for telecoms markets, a standalone regulation or specially tailored antitrust rules.\n\nZypries is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.\n\nEnding a nasty diplomatic dispute between the United States and Germany, Zypries announced at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2006 that the German government was dropping its decades-long resistance to opening the archives kept at the International Tracing Service in the town of Bad Arolsen.\n\nOn 3 June 2007, Zypries caused some controversy by saying at a meeting of G8 justice ministers in Munich that it should be assumed that missing British child Madeleine McCann was abducted by a gang that passes on children to be abused.\n\nIn response to a 2007 meeting between chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama, China canceled a high-level meeting on the protection of intellectual property rights of Chinese legal experts and Zypries in retaliation. A statement from the German Justice Ministry later said the meeting was called off \"for technical reasons.\" The opposition Green Party, which was in coalition with then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats from 1998 to 2005, also praised Merkel's stance.\n\n"}

A bear claw is usually filled with almond paste, and sometimes raisins, and often shaped in a semicircle with slices along the curved edge, or rectangular with partial slices along one side. As the dough rises, the sections separate, evoking the shape of a bear's toes, hence the name.\n\nA bear claw may also be a yeast doughnut in a shape similar to that of the pastry. Such doughnuts may have an apple pie-style filling, or other fillings such as butter pecan, dates, cream cheese, grape or cherry.\n\nThe name \"bear claw\" as used for a pastry is first attested in 1936. The phrase is more common in Western American English, and is included in the U.S. Regional Dialect Survey Results, Question #87, \"Do you use the term 'bear claw' for a kind of pastry?\"\n\nA bear claw can be made by hand or by machine. A 1948 patent describes the process of assembling the bear claw as rolling out the dough, layering filling onto it, folding the dough over, cutting small incisions to create the claw-like look, and finally cutting the dough into separate pastries. The pastry can be curved into a half-circle at this point, which causes the \"toes\" to separate.\n\n"}

It was perhaps the crown most associated with the queen and is one of the Crown Jewels on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Victoria's husband, in 1861, Queen Victoria withdrew from public life and wore a black and white ensemble colloquially known as widow's weeds, which she continued to wear until her death in 1901. Under government pressure she came back into public view in 1870. However, she declined to wear her Imperial State Crown again, partly because she found it heavy and uncomfortable to wear, and partly because it would have been impossible to wear on top of her widow's cap. The new small crown was created as a substitute, meeting both the ceremonial duties of a monarch and her own desired form of dress as a widow. It was manufactured in March 1870 by the Crown Jewellers, Garrard & Co.\n\nAlthough diminutive, the silver crown follows the standard design for British crowns. It is made up of two arches joining at a monde surmounted by a cross. Each of the arches runs from a cross pattée along the rim of the base. Between each cross pattée is a fleur-de-lis. Because of its small size – across and high – the crown possesses no internal cap. It contains 1,162 brilliant and 138 rose-cut diamonds weighing that were taken from a large necklace belonging to the queen. Unlike coloured gemstones, diamonds were seen as acceptable to wear in mourning. The crown weighs in total.\n\nQueen Victoria first used her new crown at the State Opening of Parliament on 9 February 1871. She often wore it minus the arches as a circlet or open crown.\n\nThe crown had belonged to Queen Victoria personally rather than to the Crown and thus was not a part of the Crown Jewels. Victoria left it to the Crown in her will. It was subsequently worn on occasions by the queen consort, Alexandra of Denmark (1901–10) and after her by the next queen consort, Mary of Teck (1910–36). After the death of Mary's husband, George V, she stopped wearing the crown. When the new queen consort, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (1936–52), decided not to wear the Small Diamond Crown, it was deposited by the Queen Victoria's great-grandson, George VI, in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, where it remains on public display.\n"}

During this time he was appointed to the World Council of Churches \"Commission on International Relations\".\n\nIn 1982 Stolpe became Consistorial President of the Eastern Region of the then divided \"Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg\" and, as such, a member of the Conference of Governing Bodies of the Evangelical Churches in the GDR; at the same time he was one of the two deputy chairmen of the Federation of Evangelical Churches. He gave up these positions in 1990 and 1989 respectively. He was a Stasi informer for 20 years while in the church.\n\nIn July 1990 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and on 14 October of that year he was elected to the Brandenburg State Assembly. Shortly afterwards, on 1 November 1990, he was elected Ministerpräsident of the State of Brandenburg. He was re-elected twice and he held the position until his resignation on 26 June 2002. From May 1991 to 26 June 2002 he was a Member of the SPD National Executive. From 22 October 2002 to November 2005 Federal Minister of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs.\n\nHe married Ingrid Stolpe, a physician (now retired) in 1961. The couple had one child. They both received treatment for cancer, a subject on which they wrote a book and spoke on television.\n\nStolpe has received Honorary Doctorates in Theology from the University of Greifswald (November 1989), from the University of Zurich (April 1991) and in Economics from the University of Szczecin (June 1996).\n"}
{"id": "1999597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999597", "title": "Galtonia", "text": "Galtonia\n\nGaltonia is a genus of plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae. Native to Southern Africa, the genus is named after Sir Francis Galton. According to some authorities it has been subsumed into \"Ornithogalum\" as a subgenus, while others prefer to keep it as a separate genus.\n\nThese are large, vigorous perennial bulbous geophytes, with numerous wide (>5 cm) and large tapering glabrous leaves that ascend and sheathe the stem. The inflorescences are racemose, and conical or cylindrical, but sometimes corymbose. They bear nodding (rarely erect) flowers with fleshy white or greenish yellow tepals that are fused (rarely free) into a campanulate (bell like) tube that extends about half the length of the flower, but are never fragrant. The bracts are membranous and linear-acuminate, while bracteoles are absent. The pedicels are patent The Stamens, which are hidden amongst the perianth lobes where they are inserted at the base have ovate-acuminate (oval, tapering to a point at one end) filaments that are cylindrical and adnate to the perianth tube, merged at its end (occasionally free). The ovary may be black, green or yellow and or ovoid or cylindrical. The style is filiform (thread like) and white, with a stigma that is glandular and somewhat trilobed.\n\nThe fruit capsule is lanceolate, cylindrical or ovate and acute, and wider in its basal third. The capsule is triangular in section with blunt edges and bears seeds that are large and polygonal or irregularly flattened and biseriate. The seed testa is engraved into a puzzle like pattern. The globose bulbs have soft membranous tunics. Chromosome numbers: 2n=16 (12, 14 in \"G. saundersiae\").\n\n\"Galtonia\" was first described as a new genus within Liliaceae in 1880 by Joseph Decaisne, and appeared the following year in the 1881 Kew Gardens report. He describes two species, \"G. candicans\" (\"Hyacinthus candicans\" Baker) and \"G. princeps\" (\"Hyacinthus princeps\" Baker), which are listed in an 1884 text. These were reassignments of two of Baker's species of \"Hyacinthus\", which he distinguished as sufficiently different to justify forming a new genus, with \"G. candicans\" the type species.\n\nBy the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. Baker had placed the two species of \"Galtonia\", which at that time he considered to be \"Hyacinthus\" in the tribe Hyacintheae, one of eight tribes that he divided the Liliaceae into. Later in the 1880s, \"Galtonia\" with its two species was included as a district and separate genus in two influential taxonomic systems. In the United Kingdom Bentham and Hooker published their volume on the Liliaceae in Latin in 1883. Bentham and Hooker divided it into 20 tribes and placed \"Galtonia\" in the tribe Scilleae with 19 other genera. In the German literature the taxonomic system of Engler completed its classification of Liliaceae in 1888. He divided the family into twelve subfamilies and subordinate tribes. \"Galtonia\" was then placed in the subfamily Lilioideae and tribe Scilleae together with 21 other genera. \n\nIn 1955 a third species, \"G. viridiflora\", was described, followed by \"G. regalis\" in 1986. For a graphical history of its circumscription, see Manning \"et al.\" 2009 Table 1. and Martinez-Azorin \"et al.\" Table 2. Various efforts were made during the twentieth century to dismember the Liliaceae, culminating in the separation of the higher orders, Asparagales and Liliales, and the emergence of Asparagaceae as a separate family, in which the Scilleae, including Galtonia, were now the Scilloideae subfamily. \"Galtonia\" is one of the genera in the tribe Ornithogaleae, the largest tribe within the subfamily Scilloideae. Historically it was treated as part of the subfamily Ornithogaloideae of Hyacinthaceae, now obsolete terms. The preferred treatment being to consider the Hyacinthaceae as subfamily Scilloideae of Asparagaceae. The original subfamilies within Hyacinthaceae becoming tribes of subfamily Scilloideae. Thus subfamily Ornithogaloideae became tribe Ornithogaleae. The precise taxonomy of the Ornithogaloideae/Ornithogaleae has been problematic since at least the time of Linnaeus.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis utilising plastid gene sequencing (trnL-F) brought some new clarity to the complex and controversial taxonomy of subfamily Scilloideae, with Pfosser and Speta (1999) demonstrating that the Ornithogaloideae/Ornithogaleae were one of four major clades within the subfamily. This clade also demonstrated two subclades, Ornithogaleae and Dipcadieae (which included \"Galtonia\"). Further work by Manning \"et al.\" did not support the concept of these subclades and subsumed all of the subfamily Scilloideae into the genus \"Ornithogalum\" with about 300 species. At the same time they pointed out the historical importance of \"Galtonia\" and its distinct floral characteristics and horticultural importance. In considering the circumscription of \"Galtonia\", they pointed out that the genus was paraphyletic unless it included Ornithogalum saundersiae, but to include it created problems of morphological circumscription.\n\nThis \"sensu lato\" reduction of Speta's fourteen genera into one was not widely accepted, even though they were polyphyletic, and had a number of problems. (This also had the effect of eliminating \"Galtonia\" as a genus, under which a number of \"Ornithogalum\" species are still sold.)\n\nFurther analysis with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) and an additional plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/\"Ornithogalum\". Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, \"Ornithogalum\" corresponding to Clade C, was placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into four subgenera and further sections, with 160 species. Thus three of Speta's other thirteen genera were resurrected. \"Galtonia\" on the other hand was retained as a taxon but as a subgenus of \"Ornithogalum\" with seven species.\n\nSubsequently, an alternative approach was suggested combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology and biogeography. This supported Manning \"et al.\"'s Clade C within which \"Ornithogalum\" was contained, but the very large subgenus \"Ornithogalum\" was noted to still be heterogeneous, an issue which those authors had managed by treating the subgenus in seven sections. In contrast Martinez-Azorin \"et al.\" suggested reversing the \"sensu lato\" (lumping) approach of Manning \"et al.\", reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting \"Galtonia\" and eighteen other genera.\n\nAs of April 2015 the \"sensu lato\" approach of Manning \"et al.\" (2009) is still in use by the \"World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\".\n\nManning et al. (2009) reconstructed \"Galtonia\" as a subgenus of \"Ornithogalum\", but with two sections and a type species of \"O. candicans\";\n\nThe number of species has varied from four to seven.\n\nThe traditional four species were;\n\nand these were transferred to \"Ornithogalum\" by Manning et al. (2004). When reconstructed as a subgenus there were seven species;\n\nIn the system of Martinez-Azorin \"et al.\" (2011) the original four species (\"Galtonia sensu stricto\") are maintained, together with \"Galtonia saundersiae\" as the fifth species, while the two species of section \"Xanthochlora\", a sister clade, are transferred to a separate genus— \"Ethesia\".\n\nAs of April 2015 The \"World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\" lists six species with their preferred synonyms;\n\n\nThe genus \"Galtonia \" was named by Decaisne after Sir Francis Galton, who had published his account of his travels in South Africa.\n\nThe species of \"Galtonia sensu stricto\" are distributed in the high precipitation summer rainfall, high-altitude areas of the Drakensberg, Low Drakensberg, Southern Berg and Natal Midlands of the eastern provinces of South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape) and Lesotho.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999599", "title": "Paris (Jon English musical)", "text": "Paris (Jon English musical)\n\nParis is a rock musical written by Australian rock musician Jon English and David Mackay between 1987-1990, based on the myth of the Trojan War. \nA concept album was released in Australia in 1990 with the first stage production taking place in Sydney in 2003.\n\nAccording to English, the concept for the musical began in a 1982 prank: he wrote a song called \"Oh Paris\", about the mythic hero rather than the French capital, just to see how many people actually listened to the words. The musical focuses on the love story between Helen and Paris as it follows his participation in the Trojan War. \"Paris\" is about the struggle to maintain some balance between passion and order, law and chaos, head and heart.\n\nIn 1987 Jon English took on the role of the mad monk Rasputin in the stage musical of the same name. This production, although controversial at the time, served to fire Jon’s ambition to write his own show based on the Trojan War. English travelled to England to again work with David Mackay who had produced his album \"Some People...\" (1983).\n\nFor three years, English and Mackay worked on the musical, with English stopping to star in the Sydney production of the musical \"Big River\" in 1988 and to release his studio album, \"The Busker\" (1990).\n\nThe musical was preceded in 1990 by a 2-CD concept album, called \"Paris: A Love Story\", recorded in London. English sang the role of Hector, and the cast included John Parr as Paris, Sheila Parker as Helen, Terence Donovan as Priam, Sheryl Parker as Cassandra, Doc Neeson as Achilles, John Waters as Agamemnon, Philip Quast as Patroclus, Joe Fagin as Menelaus, as well as Demis Roussos, David Atkins and Barry Humphries, backed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Choir.\n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1991, the album was nominated for two ARIA Awards, winning Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album. It was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album.\n\n\nAfter a decade of lobbying for a professional stage production, English released the amateur rights to the musical. It was first performed in October 2003 by both the Regals Musical Society in Sydney and the Laycock Street Theatre in Gosford. English appeared as the Fisherman in one performance of the Gosford production. The Melbourne premiere was on 29 January 2004 at the National Theatre, with further amateur productions in Auckland in 2005 and Adelaide in 2008. In April 2008, a re-worked version was performed at Laycock Street Theatre with new orchestrations and several new songs by Central Coast musician Andrew Swan and a re-vamped script edited by director Stuart Smith. In this production, English appeared as Menelaus. School groups and other amateur theatre companies have also performed the musical in the years since. Music Theatre Melbourne produced a concert version in July 2017 at the Melbourne Recital Centre.\n\n\nParis gave a gift to the goddess Aphrodite in order to be with her. King Priam of Troy prays for guidance from the goddesses Aphrodite and Athena. Cassandra and Laocoen lament over the poor decision that Priam is about to make. She tries to warn her father (\"Head Without a Heart\"). Priam ignores her and sends Paris to the Greek province of Sparta as an emissary to foster goodwill (\"What Could Go Wrong?\"). Paris and Aeneas sail to Sparta, but the boat is wrecked in a storm and Paris falls overboard. Helen, the wife of King Menalaus of Sparta, finds Paris washed up on shore and nurses him (\"Perfect Stranger\"). He mistakes her for Aphrodite, falling in love at first sight. Helen wishes she could leave her life behind. Paris stumbles upon Sinon, Thersites and Talbythius, who escort him to the palace to meet the Greek kings.\n\nAgamemnon and Menelaus try to convince the other Greek kings to invade Troy, but to no avail. Achilles barges in on the meeting and asks how Agamemnon thought it would be possible to take Troy without him leading the army. When Paris arrives, the Greek nobles are fighting about business (\"Business\"). They make fun of their bedraggled visitor, and Agamemnon thinks up a plan to exploit the Trojan prince for information. Helen tries to convince Paris that he has fallen into a trap, but ends up falling in love with him, and they escape together. They discuss that they can never be together, as they both have duties to their people. However, a guard finds them and tries to kill Paris, but Helen saves his life by stabbing the guard in the back. Helen's old friend, the fisherman, tells them to escape. When Agamemnon appears, he kills both the fisherman and Helen's handmaiden, framing Paris for the crime.\n\nMenelaus reflects on his love for Helen. He will never rest until he has her back. This convinces the other kings to follow him and attack Troy. Paris sings to Helen about how fate has brought them together (\"Trust in Your Heart\"). Paris and Helen arrive at Troy, facing the judgement of his entire family for provoking the Greek kings and potentially starting a war. Paris stands up to his father, telling him that he will be with Helen, \"Come Hell or High Water\". This sparks a bad reaction in the crowd, who start hurling insults at the two lovers, and not even the rebuttal of Paris' older brother, the heroic Hector, can stop their anger. A war is imminent.\n\nOn the ramparts in Troy, Hector rallies the Trojan army, leading them into battle against the invading Greeks (\"No Turning Back\"). Paris and Helen sing about their love and commitment as a ten-year war begins, and countless soldiers die around them (\"For Better or For Worse\").\n\nAchilles confronts Agamemnon about his selfish attitude and how he claims all the spoils of war for himself (\"What Price a Friend\"). He throws down his armour, saying that he won't continue to fight for Agamemnon. The Trojans launch an assault on the Greek camp, and with Achilles gone it seems all of their hope is lost. Patroclus dons his friend's armour and leading the Greeks under the guise of their immortal champion. Hector slays Patroclus, and Achilles laments the death of his only friend before challenging Hector to a duel.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his entire family, Hector prepares to face Achilles, believing that he has a chance to end the war once and for all. Hector bids farewell to his family and marches out to fight Achilles. Achilles and Hector engage in an epic duel. Hector is the better swordsman, but he cannot penetrate the armour of the immortal warrior, who relies on brute force. Hector kicks Achilles in his one weak point, his heel, and drives him to the ground, where he frantically slashes at his foe, but is still unable to harm him. Desperately, Achilles, strikes up at Hector, impaling him. As Achilles ties the body of his fallen adversary to his chariot, Paris shoots an arrow at him from the walls of Troy, hitting him in the heel and killing him.\n\nParis mourns his deceased brother as the two leaders are carried off for their funerals. Ulysses, disguised as a beggar, confronts Helen, asking her if she knows any way to end the war. She has no answers for him. Ulysses prays to Athena, asking her for a way to end the war. He gets a response from the goddess and constructs the legendary Trojan Horse, realising that the only way out is a head without a heart (\"The Horse with no Rider\"). Agamemnon 'volunteers' Sinon as a stooge in order to convince the Trojans to bring the horse inside the city. The Trojans find the horse and Sinon, who convinces Priam to take it into the city. Cassandra laments that Paris should have known better, as Thersites and Talbythius sneak out of the horse and open the gates of Troy, letting the Greek army in.\n\nA rout ensues. Paris and Aeneas try to gather up the royal family and escape the city, but find that Priam has already been murdered. They gather a small group of survivors and attempt to escape, but Menelaus finds them and shoots an arrow into Paris' back, still believing him to have abducted Helen against her will. However, as Paris dies in his lover's arms (\"Oh, Paris\"), Menalaus finally realises that Helen truly loved him and attempts to console her amidst the burning wreckage of Troy (\"Love Has Power\").\n\nAs recorded in 1990, re-released in 2003 with new songs. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999611", "title": "X-Bomber", "text": "X-Bomber\n\nThis show can be considered somewhat of a cross between the work of Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa's \"Getter Robo\" and \"Star Wars\". As in \"Getter Robo\", the show's protagonists ride three vehicles that combine into a giant robot. Big Dai X, the robot in \"X-Bomber\", is more similar to the kind seen in the popular \"Super Sentai\" series than a regular Nagai robot.\n\nThe show's opening and ending theme songs (\"Soldier in the Space\" and \"The Drifting Galaxy\", respectively) were performed by the Japanese hard rock group Bow Wow, while Kazutaka Tazaki (of The Bach Revolution) and Nakayuki Sakuraba (of Adbaloon) provided additional music for the show.\n\nThe puppets of \"X-Bomber\" were controlled from below the set using rods, and as a consequence were generally seen only from the waist up. Whereas Gerry Anderson's series were episodic in nature, \"X-Bomber\" had an overall story arc, with sub-plots and new characters being introduced as the series progressed, leading to a definite end. Similarly, rod puppets were used in Gerry Anderson's 1967 series \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\" canned as \"under-control\" puppets due to their inability to walk-whereas everywhere else they were marionettes. Anderson would later use Rod puppets in \"Terrahawks\".\n\n\"X-Bomber\" was renamed \"Star Fleet\" and dubbed by English speaking actors for broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV. The show was broadcast there on Saturday mornings, first airing on , the day before \"Star Wars\" aired for the first time on British television. Due to its broadcast slot, the advertisements shown before, during and after each episode frequently included children's Public Information Films. The series was also broadcast as such on first-run syndication in the United States.\n\nDrawing heavily on diverse influences such as \"Star Wars\", Japanese Anime and Gerry Anderson's various \"Supermarionation\" series, the show ran for twenty-four half-hour episodes (twenty-five in Japan - the eighteenth episode, titled Bloody Mary's Promotion, was not included in the English version, as it consisted mainly of flashbacks).\nThe English version's theme song was composed by Paul Bliss, and was later covered by Queen member Brian May and Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen. This was released under the name \"Star Fleet Project\".\n\nThe screenplay was adapted for English by Michael Sloan, who in later years would create the popular TV series \"The Master\" and \"The Equalizer\".\n\nActress Denise Bryer (\"Commander Makara\") and editor Tony Lenny both went on to collaborate with Gerry Anderson and Christopher Burr making another memorable sci-fi series, \"Terrahawks\".\n\nThe year is 2999 and the Earth is at peace following the Space Wars. The safety of the human race is ensured by Earth Defense Force (EDF). Shortly before the turn of the fourth millennium, the peace is broken by the appearance of a gigantic alien battle cruiser. Powerless to defend itself, the EDF's Pluto base is completely destroyed and the evil Commander Makara reveals that the same fate awaits the Earth unless the mysterious F-Zero-One is handed over to her.\n\nUnaware of the nature of F-Zero-One and fearing retribution, the EDF presses into action an untested, incomplete weapon, codenamed \"X-Project\", from its hidden moon-base. The X-Project is revealed to be a powerfully-armed spacecraft named \"X-Bomber\".\n\nThe series then follows the adventures of the crew of the X-Bomber, namely Doctor Benn, Shiro Hagen, Barry Hercules and John Lee who are joined by PPA, Lamia and her guardian Kirara. They set off to discover the nature of the F-Zero-One and try to protect it from the increasingly desperate Commander Makara and her menacing overlord, the \"Imperial Master\".\n\nEventually it is revealed that Lamia herself is the mysterious F-Zero-One, a powerful alien destined to bring peace to the galaxy at the turn of the millennium. The series continues with Lamia gradually discovering her true nature and powers while the Imperial Alliance attempts to capture her and destroy the X-Bomber. The series climaxes with the X-Bomber crew destroying Commander Makara and Lamia finally confronting and defeating the Imperial Master and bringing peace to the universe.\n\nSource(s)\n\nSome Episodes for the English version of the series were either renamed to fit the changes made or badly translated from the original titles. Although the episodes weren't officially named during the original series' run, the English DVD release confirms their titles.\n\nTwo of the English voice actors, Jay Benedict and Garrick Hagon, had been cast in \"Star Wars\" (1977) portraying Deak and Biggs in scenes largely deleted from the final cut. Benedict later played Newt's father, Russ Jordan in scenes restored for the Special Edition of \"Aliens\" released on home video in 1992. Mark Rolston also appeared in \"Aliens\" as Pvt. Drake.\n\nThe English cast list of \"Star Fleet\" was relatively small, with most voice actors doing the extra voices in the series as well. Credits were only made based on the main characters who appeared in the first episode, with the credits being reused each episode afterwards. As a result, Al Matthews was uncredited from his role later in the series.\n\n\nTwo relatively unknown manga were also created in 1980. One was drawn by Naoki Kamohara and published in the magazine Monthly Shōnen Jump by Shueisha from to and the other was drawn by Makoto Ono in the magazine TV-kun by Shogakukan from to .\n\nBritish comic magazine \"Look-In\" ran strips based on \"Star Fleet\" for 32 weeks beginning in January 1983.\n\nThe original Japanese version of the series was released in its entirety in a LD-box in 1993 and by Pioneer LDC in a DVD-box in . Both sets also contained one of two compilation movies created from \"Star Fleet\", in English with Japanese subtitles. Both sets have since gone out of print. In April 24, 2013, Bandai Visual released a Remastered DVD-Box of the series featuring enhanced and remastered scenes.\n\nIn Bulgaria \"The Thalian Space Wars\" and \"Space Quest For F-01\" tapes were released by Multi Video Center with Bulgarian dub.\n\nIn the US, eight video tapes were released which also contained compilations of the series' episodes, albeit in a less-drastically edited format.\n\nIt is possible to obtain VCD copies on eBay. These are usually taken from the American Tapes and tend to be of poor quality.\n\nIn the UK, only three \"Star Fleet\" video tapes were ever released. The first and rarest contained episodes 4 and 5 of the series. The other two were compilation movies entitled \"The Thalian Space Wars\" and \"Space Quest For F-01\". The series has not been repeated on UK television since the late 1980s.\n\nA DVD set of \"Star Fleet\" was released in the UK on by Fabulous Films. Included in the DVD set are all 24 episodes, remastered, and restored to their original UK broadcast format. Beyond the episodes, the set also includes stills and a double-sided poster, as well as a comicbook and a comprehensive 'making of' documentary, which includes contributions from series creator Go Nagai, Dr Benn voice artist Peter Marinker, Brian May, Paul Bliss and Gerry Anderson.\n\nAs a result of this release, several videos have been removed from YouTube. X-Bomber The Game, the freeware fan project, was issued with a request to remove the game from its website.\n\nFurther to the DVD release, Paul Bliss' soundtrack has been released on CD and is available via mail order.\n\nDiscotek Media announced in June 2016 that they will release the dubbed series on DVD in the United States on December 20, 2016.

{"id": "1999621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999621", "title": "Styrax", "text": "Styrax\n\nStyrax (common names storax or snowbell) is a genus of about 130 species of large shrubs or small trees in the family Styracaceae, mostly native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority in eastern and southeastern Asia, but also crossing the equator in South America. The resin obtained from the tree is called benzoin or storax (not to be confused with the \"Liquidambar\" storax balsam).\n\nThe genus \"Pamphilia\", sometimes regarded as distinct, is now included within \"Styrax\" based on analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data. The spicebush (\"Lindera benzoin\") is a different plant, in the family Lauraceae.\n\nStorax trees grow to 2–14 m tall, and have alternate, deciduous or evergreen simple ovate leaves 1–18 cm long and 2–10 cm broad. The flowers are pendulous, with a white 5–10-lobed corolla, produced 3–30 together on open or dense panicles 5–25 cm long. The fruit is an oblong dry drupe, smooth and lacking ribs or narrow wings, unlike the fruit of the related snowdrop trees (\"Halesia\") and epaulette trees (\"Pterostyrax\").\n\nBenzoin resin, a dried exudation from pierced bark, is currently produced from various \"Styrax\" species native to Sumatra, Java, and Thailand. Commonly traded are the resins of \"S. tonkinensis\" (Siam benzoin), \"S. benzoin\" (Sumatra benzoin), and \"S. benzoides\". The name \"benzoin\" is probably derived from Arabic \"lubān jāwī\" (لبان جاوي, \"Javan frankincense); compare the obsolete terms \"gum benjamin\" and \"benjoin\". This incidentally shows that the Arabs were aware of the origin of these resins, and that by the late Middle Ages at latest international trade in them was probably of major importance.\n\nThe chemical benzoin (2-Hydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone), despite the apparent similarity of the name, is not contained in benzoin resin in measurable quantities. However, benzoin resin does contain small amounts of the hydrocarbon styrene, named however for Levant storax (from \"Liquidambar orientalis),\" from which it was first isolated, and not for the genus \"Styrax\" itself; industrially produced styrene is now used to produce polystyrene plastics, including Styrofoam.\n\nSince Antiquity, storax resin has been used in perfumes, certain types of incense, and medicines.\n\nThere is some degree of uncertainty as to exactly what resin old sources refer to. Turkish sweetgum (\"Liquidambar orientalis\") is a quite unrelated tree in the family Altingiaceae that produces a similar resin traded in modern times as \"storax\" or as \"Levant storax\", like the resins of other sweetgums, and a number of confusing variations thereupon. Turkish sweetgum is a relict species that occurs only in a small area in SW Turkey (and not in the Levant at all); presumably, quite some of the \"storax resin\" of the Ancient Greek and the Ancient Roman sources was from this sweetgum, rather than a \"Styrax,\" although at least during the former era genuine \"Styrax\" resin, probably from \"S. officinalis,\" was imported in quantity from the Near East by Phoenician merchants, and Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BC indicates that different kinds of storax were traded.\n\nThe \"nataf\" (נטף) of the incense sacred to Yahweh, mentioned in the Book of Exodus, is loosely translated by the Greek term \"staktē\" (στακτή, AMP: ), or an unspecific \"gum resin\" or similar term (NIV: ). \"Nataf\" may have meant the resin of \"Styrax officinalis\" or of some other plant, perhaps Turkish sweetgum, which is unlikely to have been imported in quantity into the Near East.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, Southeast Asian benzoin resins became increasingly available; today there is little international trade in \"S. officinalis\" resin and little production of Turkish sweetgum resin due to that species' decline in numbers.\n\nStorax incense is used in the Middle East and adjacent regions as an air freshener. This was adopted in the European \"Papier d'Arménie\". Though highly toxic benzene and formaldehyde are produced when burning \"Styrax\" incense (as with almost all organic substances), the amounts produced by burning a strip of \"Papier d'Arménie\" every 2–3 days are less than those achieved by many synthetic air fresheners. Storax resin from southern Arabian species was burned during frankincense (\"Boswellia\" resin) harvesting; it was said to drive away snakes:\n\"[The Arabians] gather frankincense by burning that \"storax\" which Phoenicians carry to Hellas; they burn this and so get the frankincense; for the spice-bearing trees are guarded by small winged snakes of varied color, many around each tree; these are the snakes that attack Egypt. Nothing except the smoke of \"storax\" will drive them away from the trees.\"\n\nThere has been little dedicated research into the medical properties of storax resin, but it has been used for long, and apparently with favorable results. It was important in Islamic medicine; Avicenna (Ibn Seena, ابن سینا) discusses \"S. officinalis\" it in his \"Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb\" (القانون في الطب, \"The Law of Medicine\"). He indicates that storax resin mixed with other antibiotic substances and hardening material gives a good dental restorative material. Benzoin resin is a component of the \"Theriaca Andromachi Senioris\", a Venice treacle recipe in the 1686 \"d'Amsterdammer Apotheek\".\n\nTincture of benzoin is benzoin resin dissolved in alcohol. This and its numerous derived versions like \"lait virginal\" and friar's balsam were highly esteemed in 19th-century European cosmetics and other household purposes; they apparently had antibacterial properties. Today tincture of benzoin is most often used in first aid for small injuries, as it acts as a disinfectant and local anesthetic and seems to promote healing. Benzoin resin and its derivatives are also used as additives in cigarettes.\n\nThe antibiotic activity of benzoin resin seems mostly due to its abundant benzoic acid and benzoic acid esters, which were named after the resin; other less well known secondary compounds such as lignans like pinoresinol are likely significant too.\n\nSeveral species of storax are popular ornamental trees in parks and gardens, especially \"S. japonicus\" and its cultivars such as 'Emerald Pagoda', and \"Styrax obassia\".\n\nThe wood of larger species is suitable for fine handicrafts. That of \"egonoki\" (エゴノキ, \"S. japonicus\") is used to build \"kokyū\" (胡弓), the Japanese bowed instrument.\n\nThe resin of \"Styrax\" acts to kill wound pathogens and deter herbivores. Consequently, for example, few Lepidoptera caterpillars eat storax compared to other plants. Those of the two-barred flasher (\"Astraptes fulgerator\") were recorded on \"S. argenteus\", but they do not seem to use it on a regular basis.\n\nSome storax species have declined in numbers due to unsustainable logging and habitat degradation. While most of these are classified as vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN, only four trees of the nearly extinct \"palo de jazmin\" (\"S. portoricensis\") are known to survive at a single location. Although legally protected, this species could be wiped out by a single hurricane.\n\n"}

The show was set in fictional Bellefield, ostensibly a play on the combination of Belleville and Bloomfield, two adjacent older working class suburbs on the north side of Newark, New Jersey. The show premièred a year after \"The Sopranos\", also about an Italian-American family set in the New Jersey suburbs. Whereas \"The Sopranos\" depicted an organized crime family, however, \"That's Life\" was a light-hearted depiction of a law-abiding family (headed by veteran motion picture actors Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino).\n\nIn the first season, Frank DeLucca works as a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike, while Dolly is a housewife. In the second season, Frank retires after suffering a heart attack on the job, and he and Dolly open a restaurant. Kevin Dillon played Paulie, Lydia's younger brother who was a young officer on the Bellefield Police Department who still lived at home. Debi Mazar played Jackie, Lydia's wise-cracking friend who owned a hair salon. The show mixed family situations with situations focusing on Lydia's life as a young single woman looking for both love and stable career, and for more out of life than simply raising children.\n\nThe first season revolved around the fallout from Lydia's breaking off her engagement to Lou (Sonny Marinelli, who was written out after a few episodes), enrolling at a local university somewhat resembling nearby Montclair State University, and moving away from home for the first time. Most of the situations were light-hearted, but plots occasionally delved into darker subjects, including Paulie's struggle to resist the temptation to fall into corruption as a police officer. In the second season, Lydia finally selects a major to pursue a career in sports medicine. Her mother Dolly successfully ran for city council of Bellefield. Paulie started dating Plum (Danielle Harris), a classmate whom Lydia befriends in the first season, and marries her.\n\nThe show developed a small fan base and received generally positive critical response, but languished in the ratings, despite the presence of well-known names in its cast, in part because it aired during the Friday night death slot for much of its run. It was cancelled at the end of the second season with numerous unresolved plot lines, including the budding romance between Lydia and one of her professors.\n\n\n\n"}

As of AY 2009-2010, the department had 553 undergraduate and 89 graduate students mentored by 27 faculty members, seven of whom are PhD degree holders.\n\nThe bachelor of science in computer science program is designed to equip the student with knowledge of the fundamental concepts and a reasonable mastery of the basic tools and techniques in computer science. The undergraduate program incorporates the core material, which is universally accepted as common to computer science undergraduate programs (computer programming, computer organization, computer systems, data structures and algorithms, file processing, and programming languages). Underpinning the software orientation of the program are the subjects on database systems, software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networks and special problems (primarily, software projects).\n\nThe master of science in computer science program aims to provide the student with both breadth and depth of knowledge in the concepts and techniques related to the design, programming, and application of computing systems.\n\nThe doctor of philosophy in computer science program aims to develop computer scientists who are armed with methods, tools and techniques from both theoretical and systems aspects of computing. They should be able to formulate computing problems and develop new and innovative technology as novel solutions to address those problems. The graduates gain expertise to independently contribute to research and development (R&D) in a specialized area of computer science. The program prepares graduates for professional and research careers in industry, government or academe.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science is the youngest department of the college. Its beginnings can be traced to the mid-1970s with the institution of the master of engineering in computer science (Mengg CS) program. This was jointly administered by three departments: the Department of Engineering Sciences (ES) and the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), and the Department of Mathematics, of the College of Science. Led by the Department of Engineering Sciences, the Mengg CS program continued in the early 1980s until it was replaced by the bachelor in computer science (BCS) program.\n\nAs with the master's program, the BCS program was also a joint undertaking of the ES, EE, and Mathematics departments. An initial batch of 35 shiftees from more than 200 applicants from various colleges in the UPD were admitted into the program in the second semester of AY 1982-1983. Of the 35, 32 finished the course, 12 with Latin honors. In this first batch of computer science graduates was the 1986 engineering class valedictorian.\n\nIn August 1988, the BOR approved the renaming of the ES Department to 'Department of Engineering and Computer Sciences (ECS)' to reflect the expertise available in the department. Three years later, in August 1991, the ECS was split into two independent departments - taking ES back to its original name (Department of Engineering Sciences) and establishing the Department of Computer Science (DCS). The new department took full responsibility of offering the BCS program, which was subsequently renamed \"bachelor of science in computer science program\".\n\nIn May 1995, twenty years after the institution of the pioneering, but now defunct, MEngg CS program, the BOR approved the institution of a new master of science in computer science (MSCS) program. Furthermore, in 2010, the BOR approved the institution of a doctor of philosophy in computer science (PhD CS) program. Both the BSCS and the graduate programs continue to attract some of the best students in UP Diliman.\n\nAs of the end of the seconds semester of AY 2009-2010, the BCS/BSCS program had produced a total of 1191 graduates, 224 with Latin honors: 161 \"cum laude\", 59 \"magna cum laude\" and 4 \"summa cum laude\".\n\n\nThe UP-Mirant Java Education Center and the UP Java Research and Development Center compose the UP Java Competency Center and are part of the ASEAN Java Competency Programme. The UP Java Competency Center is a partnership of the University of the Philippines, Ayala Foundation, Mirant Foundation and Sun Microsystems.\n\nThe UP CS Network is the first student organization alliance of its kind in the UP Diliman College of Engineering. The network is composed of one socio-academic organization (UP CURSOR), two academic organizations (UP ACM and Unplug), two department service arms (UP Parser and DCS SA), one college service arm (UP Engineering Webteam), one service-development organization (UP CSI), one volunteer corps (UP DCSS) and one university service arm (CRS).\n\nThe first full active school year of existence of the CS Network (AY 2005-06) culminated in the Department of Computer Science being adjudged the college's best department for the year by the Engineering Student Council (see related external link).\n\n\n"}

It is used in perfumes, some kinds of incense, as a flavoring, and medicine (see tincture of benzoin). It is distinct from the chemical compound benzoin, which is ultimately derived from benzoin resin; the resin, however, does not contain this compound.\n\nBenzoin is sometimes called gum benzoin or gum benjamin, and in India as \"Sambrani or\" loban, though loban is, via Arabic \"lubān\", a generic term for frankincense-type incense, e.g., fragrant tree resin. Benzoin is also called storax, not to be confused with the balsam of the same name obtained from the Hamamelidaceae family.\n\nBenzoin is a common ingredient in incense-making and perfumery because of its sweet vanilla-like aroma and fixative properties. Gum benzoin is a major component of the type of church incense used in Russia and some other Orthodox Christian societies, as well as Western Catholic Churches. Most benzoin is used in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and India, where it is burned on charcoal as an incense. It is also used in the production of Bakhoor (Arabic بخور - scented wood chips) as well as various mixed resin incense in the Arab countries and the Horn of Africa. Benzoin is also used in blended types of Japanese incense, Indian incense, Chinese incense (known as Anxi xiang; 安息香), and Papier d'Arménie as well as incense sticks.\n\nThere are two common kinds of benzoin, benzoin Siam and benzoin Sumatra. Benzoin Siam is obtained from \"Styrax tonkinensis\", found across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Benzoin Sumatra is obtained from \"Styrax benzoin\", which grows predominantly on the island of Sumatra. Unlike Siamese benzoin, Sumatran benzoin contains cinnamic acid in addition to benzoic acid. In the United States, Sumatra benzoin (\"Styrax benzoin\" and \"Styrax paralleoneurus\") is more customarily used in pharmaceutical preparations, Siam benzoin (\"Styrax tonkinensis\" et al.) in the flavor and fragrance industries.\n\nIn perfumery, benzoin is used as a fixative, slowing the dispersion of essential oils and other fragrance materials into the air. Benzoin is used in cosmetics, veterinary medicine, and scented candles. It is used as a flavoring in alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, baked goods, chewing gum, frozen dairy, gelatins, puddings, and soft candy.\n"}
{"id": "1999632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999632", "title": "Tripura Sundari", "text": "Tripura Sundari\n\nTripura Sundari (Sanskrit: त्रिपुरा सुन्दरी, IAST: Tripura Sundarī), or Lalita Maha Tripura Sundari is a Hindu goddess and one of the ten Mahavidyas or Shivasakthi. She is the Shakti/consort of SadaShiva, the Prakriti to his Purusha. Lalita manifests as Goddess Sati, Goddess Parvati, Goddess Durga, Goddess Mahakali and all their incarnations, as showcased in Shakta literature. Lalita Tripura Sundari Devi is considered to be the most potent incarnation of Adi Parashakti or simply Her saguna roopa. She, along with SadaShiva is responsible for the Pancha-Krityas - Sristi or creation, Sthithi or protection, Samhara or destruction, Thirodhana or concealment of the world in Maya and Anugraha or final liberation . She is best known as the Devi glorified in the \"Lalita Sahasranama\" and as the subject of the \"Lalitopakhyanam\" (story of the goddess Lalita) in Hinduism.\n\nAccording to the Srikula tradition in Shaktism, Tripura Sundari is the foremost of the Mahavidyas and the highest aspect of Goddess Adi Parashakti. The Tripura Upanishad places her as the ultimate Shakti (energy, power) of the universe. She is described as the supreme consciousness, ruling from above Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Ishwara. Tripurasundari is said to sit on SadaShiva's lap in his form as \"Kāmeśvara\", the \"Lord of Desire\". Tripura Sundari is also the primary goddess associated with the Shakta Tantric tradition known as Sri Vidya.\n\nThe Sanskrit word 'Tripura' is a combination of two Sanskrit words; \"\"Tri\"\" meaning \"\"tráyas (three)\"\" and \"\"pura\"\" meaning a city or citadel, but also understood as referring to three cities or citadels \"\"built of gold, silver, and iron, in the sky, air, and earth, by Maya for the Asuras, and burnt by Śiva\"\" referring to the legend of the three cities destroyed by Shiva. However, \"\"Tripura\"\" can also mean \"\"Śiva Śaktir (Shiva Shakti)\"\" while \"\"sundarī\"\" means \"\"a beautiful woman\"\".\n\nTherefore, \"\"Tripura Sundarī\"\" literally means \"\"She who is beautiful in the three worlds\"\".\n\nThe Tripura Sundari Temple is located in the district town of Udaipur in Tripura, about one and a half hour drive from Agartala.\n\nShe is called Tripura because she is identical with the triangle (trikona) that symbolizes the yoni and that forms her chakra (see below). She is also called Tripura because her mantra\nhas three clusters of syllables. Here Tripura is identified with the alphabet, from which all sounds and words proceed and which is often understood to occupy a primordial place in tantric cosmology. She is three-fold, furthermore, because she expresses herself in Brahma, Visnu, and Siva in her roles as creator, maintainer, and destroyer of the universe. She is threefold also because she represents the subject (maul), instrument (mina), and object (meya) of all things. Here again, she is identified with reality expressed in terms of speech, which involves a speaker, what is said, and objects to which the words refer.\n\nTripura Sundari is also known by names as Ṣoḍaśī (\"She who is the sixteenth\"), Lalitā, Kāmeśvarī, Śrīvidyā and Raj Rajeshwari. The Shodashi Tantra refers to Shodashi as the \"Beauty of the Three Cities,\" or Tripurasundari.\n\nShe is Tripura because she is beyond the three Gunas. She dwells in the three worlds of manas, buddhi, and chitta. She is Trayi, the unified combination of the three gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. She is also known as Lalita (the graceful one) and Kameshwari (the desire principle of the Supreme).\n\nDetails of her appearance are found in the famous hymn in her praise, the Lalita Sahasranama, where she is said to be,\n\nShiva is one of the three gods who together constitute the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity. Shiva married Sati, the daughter of Daksha. Daksha and Shiva did not get along and consequently, Daksha did not invite Shiva for one of the great fire sacrifices that he conducted. However, Sati went to attend that function in spite of Shiva's protest. Daksha insulted Shiva in Sati's presence, so Sati committed suicide by jumping into the fire to end her humiliation. Consequently, Shiva decapitated Daksha, but after Shiva's anger had been reduced he allowed Daksha to be resurrected with a goat's head. This incident, i.e. death of his wife, upset Shiva and he entered into deep meditation. Sati reincarnated as Parvati, the daughter of the mountain king Himavat and his wife the apsara Mena. This was possible due to a boon was given to them by Adi Parashakti (un-manifested form of Parvati Lalita Tripura Sundari or Nirguna Brahman). Naturally, Pārvatī sought and received Shiva as her husband.\n\nThe devas faced an enemy in Tarakasura, who had a boon that he could be killed only by a son of Shiva and Parvati. So for the purpose of begetting a son from Shiva and Parvati, the devas deputed Manmatha, the god of love. Manmatha shot his flower arrows to Shiva and Parvati in order to induce love feelings in them. In anger for being tricked, Shiva opened his third eye which reduced the god of love to ashes. The devas and Rathi Devi, the wife of Manmatha, requested Shiva to give life to Manmatha. Heeding their request, Shiva stared at the ashes of Manmatha. From the ashes came Bhandasura, who made all the world impotent and ruled from the city called Shonitha pura, after which he started troubling the devas. The devas then sought the advice of Sage Narada and the Trimurti, who advised them to seek the help of Nirguna Brahman, the ultimate god head which is unmanifested i.e. Sat-Chit-Ananada (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss). Nirguna Brahman (Parashivalalita) divided itself into the male, Maha Shambhu and the female, Adi Parashakti (who were unmanifested and beyond the manifest) and appeared before them. Maha Shambhu and Adi Parashakti agreed to take the forms of Maha Kameshwara and Kameshwari Tripura Sundari respectively, for the benefit of the universe. For this, a maha yajna (great sacrifice) was made, where the entire creation, i.e. the manifest universe, was offered as the oblation, and from the fire rose Kameshvari Tripura Sundari and Kameshvara. Tripura Sundari and Kameswara re-created the entire universe as it was before. They re-created Brahma and Saraswati, Vishnu and Lakshmi, and all the other devas. Also, as Vishnu helped Parvati attain Shiva (Tripura Sundari to marry Kameswara), Vishnu subsequently came to be known as the brother of Parvati.\n\nIn another story, Parvati, upon her love for and desire to charm Shiva, transforms herself into Lalita Tripura Sundari to showcase her beauty and omnipresence in the three worlds.\n\nHer abode also called Sri Nagara(city)/Manidvipa had 25 streets circling it, made of iron, steel, copper, and lead. An alloy made of five metals, silver, gold, the white Pushpa raga stone, the red Padmaraga stone, onyx, diamond, Vaidoorya, Indra neela Blue Sapphire, pearl, Marakatha, coral, nine gems and a mixture of gems and precious stones. In the eighth street was a forest of Kadambas. This is presided by Syamala. In the fifteenth street lived the Ashta Dik palakas. In the sixteenth lived Varahi alias Dandini who was her commander in chief. Here Syamala also had a house. In the seventeenth street lived the different Yoginis. In the eighteenth street lived Maha Vishnu. In the nineteenth street lived Ishana, in the twentieth Tara Devi, twenty-first Varuni, the twenty-second Kurukulla who presides over the fort of pride, twenty third Martanda Bhairava, twenty-fourth Chandra, and twenty-fifth Manmatha presiding over the forest of love.\n\nIn the center of Nagara is the Maha Padma Vana (the great lotus forest) and within it, the Chintamani Griha (The house of holy thought), in the northeast is the Chid agni kunda and on both sides of its eastern gate are the houses of Mantrini and Dandini. On its four gates stand the Chaturamnaya gods for watch and ward. Within it is the chakra. In the center of the Chakra on the throne of Pancha brahmas on the Bindu Pitha (dot plank) called sarvanandamaya (universal happiness) sits Maha Tripura Sundari. In the chakra are the following decorations viz., the square called Trilokya mohanam (most beautiful in the three worlds), The sixteen petaled lotus called Sarvasa paripurakam (fulfiller of all desires), the eight petaled lotus called Sarvasamksopanam (the all cleanser), the fourteen cornered figure called Sarva saubhagyam (all luck), the external ten cornered figure called Sarvartha sadhakam (giver of all assets), the internal ten cornered figure called Sarva raksha karam (All protector), the eight cornered figure called Sarva roga haram (cure of all diseases), the triangle called Sarva siddhi pradam (giver of all powers) and the dot called Sarvananda mayam.\n\nThe devas prayed to her to kill Bhandasura. When she started for the war with Bandasura, she was accompanied by the powers called Anima, Mahima, Brahmani, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Maheshwari, Chamundi, Rudrani, Nitya Devaths and Avarna Devathas who occupy the chakra. While Sampatkari was the captain of the elephant regiment, Aswarooda was the captain of the cavalry. The army was commanded by Dhandini riding on the chariot called Giri Chakra assisted by Manthrini riding on the chariot called Geya Chakra. Jwala Malini protected the army by creating a fire ring around it. Tripura Sundari rode in the center on the chariot of Chakra. Nithya destroyed a large chunk of Bhandasura's armies, Bala killed the son of Bhandasura, and Manthrini and Dhandini killed his brothers called Vishanga and Vishukra. When the asuras created a blockade for the marching army, Tripura sundari created Ganesha with the help of Kameshwara to remove the blockade. Then Bhandasura created the asuras called Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu and Ravana. She killed all his army using Pasupathastra and killed him with Kameshwarasthra. The gods then praised her. She then recreated Manmathan for the good of the world. This story is contained in the first 84 names of the first 34 slokas of \"Lalitha sahasranamam\". All together it contains one thousand names. This is also called the \"Rahasya Nama Sahasra\" (the thousand secret names). Reading it, meditating on the meaning of the names would lead to the fulfillment of all the wishes of the devotees.\n\n\"Lalita Sahasranama\" contains a thousand names of the Hindu mother goddess \"Lalita\". The names are organized in a hymns (\"stotras\"). It is the only \"sahasranama\" that does not repeat a single name. Further, in order to maintain the meter, \"sahasranamas\"s use the artifice of adding words like tu, api, ca, and hi, which are conjunctions that do not necessarily add to the meaning of the name except in cases of interpretation. The \"Lalita sahasranama\" does not use any such auxiliary conjunctions and is unique in being an enumeration of holy names that meet the metrical, poetical and mystic requirements of a \"sahasranama\" by their order throughout the text.\n\n\"Lalita Sahasranama\" begins by calling the goddess \"Shri Mata\" (the great mother), \"Shri Maharajni\" (the great queen) and \"Shrimat Simhasaneshwari\" (the queen sitting on the lion-throne). In verses 2 and 3 of the \"Sahasranama\" she is described as a \"Udayatbhanu Sahasrabha\" (the one who is as bright as the rays of thousand rising suns), \"Chaturbahu Samanvita\" (the one who has four hands) and \"Ragasvarupa Pashadhya\" (the one who is holding the rope). \"Chidagnikunda Sambhuta\" (one who was born from the altar of the fire of consciousness) and \"Devakarya samudyata\" (one who manifested Herself for fulfilling the objects of the \"devas\") are among other names mentioned in the \"sahasranama\".\n\n\"Lalitha sahasranama\" is said to have been composed by eight vak devis (vaag devathas) upon the command of Lalitha. These vaag devis are Vasini, Kameshwari, Modhinee, Vimala, Aruna, Jayinee, Sarveshwari, Koulini. The sahasranama says that \"One can worship Lalitha only if she wishes us to do so\". The text is a dialogue between Hayagriva, an (avatar) of Mahavishnu and the sage Agastya. The temple at Thirumeyachur, near Kumbakonam is said to be where Agastya was initiated into this sahasranama. Another alternative version is the Upanishad Bramham Mutt at kanchipuram is where this initiation happened.\n\nThis sahasranama is held as a sacred text for the worship of the \"Divine Mother\", Lalita, and is used in the worship of Durga, Parvati, Kali, and other forms of Parvati. A principal text of Shakti worshipers, it names her various attributes, and these names are organized in the form of a hymn. This sahasranama is used in various modes for the worship of the Divine Mother. Some of the modes of worship are parayana (Recitations), archana, homa etc.\n\nThis stotra (hymn of praise) occurs in the Brahmanda Purana (history of the universe) in the chapter on a discussion between Hayagreeva and Agasthya. Hayagreeva is an incarnation of Vishnu with the head of a horse who is held to be the storehouse of knowledge. Agasthya is one of the sages of yore and one of the stars of the constellation Saptarshi (Ursa major). At the request of Agasthya, Hayagreeva is said to have taught him the thousand holiest names of Lalita. This has been conveyed to us by the sage Maharishi Vyasa. \"Lalitha Sahasranama\" is the only sahasranama composed by vag devatas under Lalitha's direction. All the other sahasranamas are said to have been composed by Maharishi Vyasa.\n\nThe slokas are organized in such a way that Devi is described from head to feet (kesadhi padham). There are basically five works (\"pancha krtyam\"). They are creation (\"srishti\"), protection (\"sthiti\"), destruction (\"samharam\"), hiding (\"thirudhanam\") and blessing (\"anugraham\"). Devi herself has been described as \"pancha krtya parayana\" in the \"sloka\" and the five tasks are described as follows:\n\nThis means Devi is the aspect of Brahma, while creating \"sristhi\", aspect of Vishnu while sustaining \"sristhi\", aspect of Rudra during dissolution \"sanghara\". These five entities (Brahmma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadasiva) are known as \"pancha-brahma\". Lalitha has designated the five functions to these brahmam. Sometimes, Devi will take away the life from these five brahmmam and make them inactive, performing all the five tasks herself. At that time they will be called \"pancha pretam\" that is lifeless bodies.The first three slokas are: Srimata (great mother) – srshti; Sri Maharajni (great ruler) – sthithi; Srimat Simhasaneswari (one who sits on the lion throne) – samharam. The rest of the slokas cover thirodhanam and anugraham.\n\nThe next names – \"chidhagnikunda sambhutha devakarya samudhyatha\" tells us that devi arose from the fire of knowledge to help devas in their task (war against asuras – bhandasura). From the namAa- Udhyath bhanu sahasraba till sinjanamani manjeera manditha sree padambuja, all her parts like her face, fore head, eyes, mouth, tongue, voice, hands and legs have been described.Thereafter, Devi's place (Chintamani gruham), her war against bandasura, kundalini shakti, and her properties have been described. A common image of the goddess depicts a parrot and a sugarcane with her. Sugarcane represents the sweetness of her mind.\n\nThe \"Soundarya Lahari\" of Adi Shankaracharya deals exhaustively about the nature of the Goddess and her worship.\n\nThe \"Lalitopakyana\" tells of the epic battle between her forces and the forces of the arch-demon Bhandasura.\n\nThe \"Tripura Sundari Ashtakam\" by Adi Shankaracharya describes her as a Mother wearing a blue and red-spotted dress and holding a pot of honey.\n\nIn the Shri Vidya school of Hindu tantra, the Sri Yantra (\"sacred instrument\"), also Sri Chakra is a diagram formed by nine interlocking triangles that surround and radiate out from the central (bindu) point.\nIt represents the goddess in her form of Shri Lalita Or Tripura Sundari, \"the beauty of the three worlds (earth, atmosphere and sky(heaven)\"(Bhoo, Bhuva and Swa).\nThe worship of the Sri Chakra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. Four isosceles triangles with the apices upwards, representing Shiva or the Masculine. Five isosceles triangles with the apices downward, symbolizing female embodiment Shakti. Thus the Sri Yantra also represents the union of Masculine and Feminine Divine. Because it is composed of nine triangles, it is known as the \"Navayoni Chakra\".\n\"These nine triangles are of various sizes and intersect with one another. In the middle is the power point (bindu), visualizing the highest, the invisible, elusive centre from which the entire figure and the cosmos expand. The triangles are enclosed by two rows of (8 and 16) petals, representing the lotus of creation and reproductive vital force. The broken lines of the outer frame denote the figure to be a sanctuary with four openings to the regions of the universe\".\n\nIn a recent issue of Brahmavidya, the journal of the Adyar Library, Subhash Kak argues that the description of Sri Yantra is identical to the yantra described in the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad.\n\nTogether the nine triangles are interlaced in such a way as to form 43 smaller triangles in a web symbolic of the entire cosmos or a womb symbolic of creation. Together they express Advaita or non-duality. This is surrounded by a lotus of eight petals, a lotus of sixteen petals, and an earth square resembling a temple with four doors. The various deities residing in the nine layers of the Sri Yantra are described in the Devi Khadgamala Mantra.\n\nThe Shri Chakra is also known as the \"nava chakra\" because it can also be seen as having nine levels. \"Nine\" comes from\" Nava\" of Sanskrit. Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini, and a specific form of the Deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. These levels starting from the outside or bottom layer are:\n\nThe Sri Chakra (called the Shri Yantra) is the symbol of Hindu tantra, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism. The Sri Yantra is the object of devotion in Sri Vidya.\n\nThe two dimensional Sri Chakra, when it is projected into three dimensions is called a Maha Meru (Mount Meru).\n\nHer most important temple is the Kanchi Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. Kanchipuram is one of the moksha puris. Sage Durvasa done intense penance in Kanchipuram and the pleased Lalita Tripura Sundari appeared and agrees to reside in Kanchi for the benefit of her devotees. Sage Durvasa installed the Sri Chakra in this temple. It is also the place of Kanchi Kamakoti mandali.\n\nHer temple, the Tripura Sundari temple is located on top of the hills near Radhakishorepur village, a little distance away from Udaipur town in Tripura and in Banaswara, Rajasthan. In West Bengal, there is a temple of Ma Tripura Sundari Devi located in Boral, near Garia. In Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, there is Tripura Sundari temple about 12 km from city on Bhedaghat road in village Tewar. In the outskirts of Chennai, is the Shri Tirusoolanathar Tripurasundari temple, an ancient temple built by Kulothunga Chola I in the 11th century. The Trisula Nathar Temple is dedicated to Sri Shiva as Trisula Nathar and Divine Mother Shakti as Tripura Sundari Amman.\n\nA temple of Tripura Sundari temple is in Chhatrabhog (Saturbhog). It is situated in south 24 Pgs under Diamond Harbour Subdivision West Bengal. The nearest railway station is Mathurapur Road in Sealdah South section. From the source of Rajratnakar descendants of Drajhu king, Kalinda made a wooden Tripura Sundari icon at this place. \n\nMany temples of Goddess Raj Rajeshwari are also found in Uttarakhand, where she is considered as the Kul-devi.

She is a Distinguished University Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park. She is also the former head of the Department of African-American Studies at the University of Cincinnati, and a past President of the American Sociological Association. Collins was the 100th president of the ASA and the first African-American woman to hold this position.\n\nCollins's work primarily concerns issues involving feminism, gender, and social inequality within the African-American community. She first came to national attention for her book \"\", originally published in 1990.\n\nCollins was born in 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were Albert Hill, a factory worker and World War II veteran, and Eunice Randolph Hill, a secretary. Her parents met in Washington D.C., where Eunice had migrated to find work after the end of the war. Patricia has no siblings.\n\nCollins attended the Philadelphia public schools—and even at a young age, Collins had the realization of her lived reality—she attended a school that catered to mostly white middle class students that was in a predominantly black neighborhood. During the time of the 1950s and 1960s, when Patricia was going to school, most schools in northern cities like Philadelphia were channels for social mobility, and although they were well funded, they were not particularly easy to navigate, especially for African-Americans and people of color like Patricia. However, to her advantage, Patricia was part of a cohort of working-youth who had educational opportunities long denied to their parents. She attended Frederick Douglas Elementary School and later Philadelphia High School for Girls (aka Girls' High), which was founded in 1848 as the nation's first public high school for women only. Collins had the unique experience of attending Girls' High during the 1960s process of desegregation of schools, which contributed to her growing interest in sociology, feminism, and activism for African-American and civil rights.\n\nCollins went on to pursue an undergraduate career at Brandeis University in 1965 as a sociology major, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology in 1969. She proceeded to earn a Master of Arts degree in Teaching (MAT) in Social Science Education from Harvard University in 1970. From 1970 to 1976, she was a teacher and curriculum specialist at St. Joseph Community School in Roxbury, Boston, among two others. She went on to become the Director of the Africana Center at Tufts University from 1976 to 1980. At Tufts, she met and married Roger L. Collins, a professor of education at the University of Cincinnati, with whom she has one daughter, Valerie L. Collins.\n\nShe completed her doctorate in sociology back at Brandeis in 1984. While earning her PhD, Collins worked as an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, alongside her husband, beginning in 1982.\n\nIn 1986, Collins published her first piece of writing in a sociological journal titled \"Social Problems\". Titled \"Learning From the Outsider Within\", the article put Collins on the map as a sociologist as well as an activist for feminism and rights for African Americans. The article, published four years prior to her first book, articulates a standpoint reflecting her race, social class, and gender while she moved across and within various institutions. It also focuses on how African-American women have made creative use of their marginality, or \"outsider\" status, and benefited from this different way of thinking, a way of thinking that put themselves in the shoes of those who marginalize them.\n\nIn 1990, Collins published her first book, \"Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment\". A revised 10th-anniversary edition of the book was published in 2000, and subsequently translated into Korean in 2009.\n\nIn 2005, Collins joined the University of Maryland's department of sociology as a Distinguished University Professor. Working closely with graduate students on issues regarding race, feminist thought, and feminist theory, she maintains an active research agenda and continues to write books and articles in relations to social, racial, and gender issues. Her current work has transcended the borders of the United States, in keeping with the recognition within sociological globalized social system. Collins is focused on understanding, in her own words, \"How African American male and female youth's experiences with social issues of education, unemployment, popular culture and political activism articulate with global phenomena, specifically, complex social inequalities, global capitalist development, transnationalism, and political activism.\"\n\nIn 1990, Collins published \"\", which looked at the title topic through such figures as Angela Davis, Alice Walker and Audre Lorde. The analysis incorporated a wide range of sources, including fiction, poetry, music and oral history. This book is the first book to incorporate the literature of and by African-American women. Collins's work concluded with three central claims:\n\nIn \"Black Feminist Thought\", Collins posits how Black feminist studies made of Black women's works highlight two very important themes. One being \"how Black women's paid work is organized within intersecting oppressions of race, class, and gender.\" Although these women have fled from domestic work in private homes, they continue to work at low-paying jobs. Moreover, she continues, the theme that \"concerns how Black women's unpaid family labor is simultaneously confining and empowering\" for them is also extremely important. Collins emphasizes this point because she points out that Black women see the unpaid work of their household as a method of resistance to oppression rather than a method of manipulation by men. \n\nPublished in 1992, \"Race, Class and Gender: An Anthology\" was a collaboration with Margaret Andersen, in which Collins helped edit a compilation of essays on of race, class and gender. The book is widely recognized for shaping the field of race, class and gender studies, as well as its related concept of intersectionality. The essays cover a variety of topics, from historical trends and their lasting effects today, to the current media portrayal of minority groups. The sixth edition was published in 2007.\n\nCollins published a third book \"Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice\" in 1998. \"Fighting Words\" focused on how Black women have confronted the injustices against them within Black communities, expanding on the idea of \"outsiders within\" from her previous book. She examines how outsiders resist the majority's perspective, while simultaneously pushing for and creating new insight on the social injustices that exist. Collins also notes how acknowledging the social theories of oppressed groups are important because their different experiences have created new angles of looking at human rights and injustice. This has not always been the case because, as she points out, the \"elites possess the power to legitimate the knowledge that they define as theory as being universal, normative, and ideal\". \"Fighting Words\" seeks to explore how Black women can change from simply having \"thoughts\" to rather being considered as having \"theories\".\n\nCollins's next book was \"\", published in 2004. This work argued that racism and heterosexism were intertwined, and that ideals of beauty work to oppress African-Americans males and females, whether homo-, bi- or heterosexual. Collins asserts that people must examine the intersection of race, class, and gender, and that looking at each issue separately leads to missing a large part of the problem. Her argument for resisting the creation of such narrow gender roles requires action on individual and community levels, and recognizing success in areas other than those typically respected by Americans, such as money or beauty. Collins also contends that the oppression of African Americans cannot be successfully resisted until oppressions within their own group, such as towards women or LGBT people, are stopped. \"Black Sexual Politics\" won the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award from the American Sociological Association.\n\nIn 2006 she published \",\" which examines the relationship between Black nationalism, feminism and women in the hip-hop generation. The book is a compilation of multiple essays by her, written over multiple years, compiled into one cohesive examination of the current situation of African Americans. Collins examines the prejudice existing today, which she calls \"new racism,\" and explores how old ideas about what racism is prevents society from recognizing and fixing the wrongdoings that still greatly exist. The author explores a range of examples, from American identity, to motherhood, to feminine portrayal in hip-hop. Following the Civil Rights Movement, she argues, there was a \"shift from color-conscious racism that relied on strict racial segregation to a seemingly colorblind racism that promised equal opportunities yet provided no lasting avenues for African American advancement\".\n\nIn 2009, Collins published \"Another Kind of Public Education: Race, Schools, the Media and Democratic Possibilities,\" in which she encourages the public to be more aware of and prevent the institutional discrimination that African-American children are experiencing today in the public education system. Collins explains that teachers have a great deal of power to be the facilitators of either discriminatory attitudes or tolerant attitudes; they are the \"frontline actors negotiating the social issues of our time.\" Claiming that the education system is greatly influenced by the media, Collins examines racism as a system of power preventing education and democracy to reach its full potential.\n\nCollins co-edited with John Solomos \"The Handbook of Race and Ethnic Studies\" (2010), and in 2012 published \"On Intellectual Activism\".\n\nIn 2016, Collins also published the book \"Intersectionality,\" with co-author Sirma Bilge, which discusses, in depth, the intertwined nature of social categorizations such as race, class and gender, and how they create a complex web of discrimination and disadvantage in society. Topics covered include social inequality, stratification, and civil rights, using contemporary examples such as specific companies, big business, and the FIFA world cup outcomes.\n\nCollins is recognized as a social theorist, drawing from many intellectual traditions. She reconceptualizes the ideas of race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression. Her more than 40 articles and essays have been published in a wide range of fields, including philosophy, history, psychology, and most notably sociology.\n\n\"Oppressed groups are frequently placed in the situation of being listened to only if we frame our ideas in the language that is familiar to and comfortable for a dominant group. This requirement often changes the meaning of our ideas and works to elevate the ideas of dominant groups.\"\n\n\"Challenging power structures from the inside, working the cracks within the system, however, requires learning to speak multiple languages of power convincingly.\"\n\n\"Social conditions that spur large numbers of people into action are ignored in favor of a Hollywood version of history focusing on one conquering hero. Since a movement for social change is embodied in its leader, death of the leader means death of the movement.\"\n\n\"Racism didn't magically go away just because we refuse to talk about it. Rather, overt racial language is replaced by covert racial euphemisms that reference the same phenomena-talk of \"niggers\" and \"ghettos\" becomes replaced by phrases such as \"urban,\" \"welfare mothers,\" and \"street crime.\" Everyone knows what these terms mean, and if they don't, they quickly figure it out.\" (From \"On Intellectual Activism\", 2012)\n\nIn 2009, a video from the C-Span website titled \"BookTV: Patricia Hill Collins, author \"Another Kind of Public Education\" Collins takes a visit to \"Busboys & Poets\", a restaurant/bookstore/theater located in Washington DC and provided an hour and 16 minutes-long \"book talk\" regarding her book \"Another Kind of Public Education\". As the website describes the video: \"Professor Collins posits that public education is heavily influenced by the media and by the continuing influence of institutional racism and she examines ways in which schools perpetuate racism and other forms of social inequality. Professor Collins also read passages from her book and responded to questions from members of the audience.\"\n\nIn 2012, a video from the YouTube website titled \"Dr. Patricia Hill Collins Delivers 2012 Graduate Commencement Address\", Collins gives the commencement address at Arcadia University on Thursday, May 17, 2012, when she received an honorary doctorate; she provides stories of her past from growing up in Philadelphia, her parents (as well as her) struggles, and being in a school that predominately caters to middle-class white students. She also touches upon breaking her silence and how she came about using her voice as a critical instrument to make social change.\n\nIn 2014, a video from the YouTube website titled \"Patricia Hill Collins at Grand Valley State University February 2014\". Collins gives a talk to undergrad students from Grand Valley State University in which she expresses her concern of mainstream colorblindness, especially focusing on issues of racial profiling (regarding African Americans) [regarding Trayvon Martin] and tackling other issues regarding race, sex, class, etc. Also reads mini excerpts from her book \"Black Feminist Thought\". The website description is: \"On February 26, 2014, Grand Valley State University's Office of Multicultural Affairs, Women's Center and LGBT Resource Center hosted Patricia Hill Collins as part of ongoing Intersections programming. Patricia Hill Collins presented \"We Who Believe in Freedom Cannot Rest: Lessons from Black Feminism.\"\n\nIn 2015, a YouTube video titled \"Patricia Hill Collins Keynote at 2015 Social Theory Forum @ UMass Boston\". Collins visits University of Massachusetts Boston and presents a presentation regarding the sociological theory mainly focusing on intersectionality's challenges and the critical inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He soon became one of its representatives in Croatian Parliament, after the second Sabor election.\n\nIn 1992, when the war escalated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Prkačin took part as a leader of HSP militia Croatian Defence Forces (\"Hrvatske obrambene snage\", HOS) with the rank of general, and had close co-operation with government of Alija Izetbegović. After Blaž Kraljević was killed in August 1992, Prkačin participated in the negotiations of HOS and Croatian Defence Council (HVO). In the fall of the same year, he was a member of the joint command of Croatian Defence Council and Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nAfter HOS was disbanded, Prkačin was commander of the defence of Posavina as HVO officer.\n\nUpon his return to Croatia, he began to distance himself from Dobroslav Paraga and spent the rest of his Sabor days as independent representative.\nHe left HSP in 1995.\n\nIn October 1999, he founded a new party called New Croatia (\"Nova Hrvatska\"), and under its banner ran for Croatian President.

Ideally these recreational activities promote self-esteem and personal fulfillment, through an emphasis on holistic care; providing physical, psychological, social, intellectual and spiritual/cultural support.\n\nDiversional Therapists work in a wide variety of settings, such as \nRehabilitation & hospital units,\nJustice Centres, \nCommunity Centres, \nDay and Respite services, \nAged Care Residential Facilities, \nEthnic Specific Services, \nPalliative Care Units and Outreach Programmes, \nMental Health Services, \nSpecialist Organisations, \nPrivate Practice, \nConsultancy & Management.\n\nThe diversional therapist works with a client to achieve positive health outcomes by incorporating leisure programmes into their lifestyles. He or she assists decision-making and participation when developing and managing these programmes. These are often quite diverse and can range from: \n· Games, outings, gardening, computers, gentle exercise, music, arts and crafts.\n· Individual emotional and social support\n· Sensory enrichment, activities like massage and aromatherapy, pet therapy\n· Discussion groups, education sessions like grooming, beauty care, cooking\n· Social, cultural and spiritual activities\n\nDiversional Therapy is not just about passing the time, about being entertainers or babysitters. As an unknown author once said \"\"Recreation's purpose is not to kill time, but to make time live; not to keep people occupied, but to keep them refreshed; not to offer an escape from life, but to provide a discovery of life.\"\"\n\nTo become a diversional therapist in Australia you must complete a diploma or degree in diversional therapy or leisure and health studies and this course needs to be recognised by the Diversional Therapy Association of Australia. Entry to the degree courses usually requires completion of your HSC/ACT Year 12 with prerequisite subjects, or assumed knowledge, in one or more of English, chemistry or biology. The various universities have different prerequisites and some have flexible entry requirements or offer external study. Contact the universities you are interested in for more information as requirements may change.\n\nIn New Zealand, you can complete a National Certificate in Diversion Therapy. This course of study generally takes 18 months to complete, and participants must have already achieved a Level 3 Core Competencies qualification, which is a basic all-round groundwork course. The diversional therapy courses are usually offered by institutions that focus on practical learning and skills, teaching about the roles of the diversional therapist and developing the ability to create a plan of care.\n\nLeisure has many well documented health related benefits. \n\nPhysical Benefits can include:\n\n• Decrease in blood pressure \n• Decrease in heart rate \n• Increase in bone mass and strength \n• Increase in lung capacity \n• Reduction in incidence of diabetes \n• Increase in muscle strength \n• Increase in sense of well being \n• Increase in flexibility, balance and coordination \n• Improvement in immune system \n\nEmotional Benefits can include:\n\n• Happiness \n• Life satisfaction \n• Morale \n• Self-concept \n• Self-esteem \n• Perceived sense of freedom \n• Independence \n• Autonomy \n• Self-confidence \n• Leadership skills \n• Tolerance/Understanding \n• Problem solving skills\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999675", "title": "Substitution (theatre)", "text": "Substitution (theatre)\n\nIn acting, substitution is the understanding of elements in the life of one's character by comparing them to elements in one's own life. For example, if an actor is portraying a character who is being blackmailed, he or she could think back to some embarrassing or private fact about his or her own life, and mentally superimpose that onto the character's secret.\n\nIn Respect for Acting, Uta Hagen compares acting to make believe, saying, \"My strength as an actor rested in the unshakable faith I had in make-believe. I made myself believe the characters I was allowed to play and the circumstances of the characters' lives in the events of the play.\" And later in the book, \"I use substitution in order to 'make believe' in its literal sense-- to make \"me\" believe [...], in order to send me into the moment-to-moment spontaneous action of my newly selected self on stage.\" \n\nHagen is clear that substitution is a means to further connect actors to their characters and the actions of the play, as opposed to, for instance, bringing on tears. \"Substitution is not an end in itself, not an end to involve you for self-involvement's sake without consequent action. Let me state strongly, in case any of you have misunderstood, that substitution is the aspect of the work which strengthens your faith and your sense of reality in each stage of the total work on character. It is a way of bringing about justified, personal character actions.\" \n\nHagen also warns against confronting any traumatic experiences, believing it to be unhelpful. \"There are teachers who actually force actors into dealing with something buried (their response to a death of a parent, or the trauma of a bad accident). What results is hysteria or worse, and is, in my opinion, anti-art. We are not pursuing psychotherapy. If you feel mentally sick or disturbed and in need of it, by all means go to a trained doctor or therapist, but \"not\" to an acting teacher.\" \n"}

It stars Albert Finney, Diane Venora, Gregory Hines and Edward James Olmos. The film follows a city cop who has been assigned to uncover what is behind a series of vicious murders. Originally, it is believed the murders are animal attacks, until the cop discovers an ancient Indian legend about wolf spirits.\n\nFormer NYPD Captain Dewey Wilson is brought back to the force and assigned to solve a bizarre string of violent murders after high-profile magnate Christopher Van der Veer, his wife and his bodyguard are slain in Battery Park. Executive Security, the private firm employed by Van der Veer, blames the murders on terrorists, but knowing that the victim's bodyguard was a 300-pound Haitian with voodoo ties makes Wilson skeptical. With pressure to solve the case coming from both the Police Commissioner and the Mayor, Wilson is partnered with criminal psychologist Rebecca Neff.\n\nElsewhere, in the South Bronx, a homeless man explores an abandoned church that is scheduled to be demolished by Van der Veer's development company. He is killed by an unseen monstrous being. Wilson and Neff investigate his murder. At the church, apparent sounds of a baby crying lure Neff up to the bell tower. Wilson follows her but does not hear the crying; once Neff is separated from him, he hears a wolf howl. He goes up after Neff and drags her to safety. Later that night, a bridge worker is apparently murdered by the same creature.\n\nCoroner Whittington discovers non-human hairs on several victims and consults a zoologist named Ferguson, who identifies the hairs as belonging to an unknown subspecies of \"Canis lupus\". Ferguson compares wolves to Native Americans. Inspired, Wilson finds Eddie Holt, a militant Native activist he arrested some years previously, working in construction. While Wilson interrogates Holt on top of the Manhattan Bridge, Holt claims to be a shapeshifter, which implicates him as the killer. Wilson opts to leave Holt alone and tail him that night.\n\nFollowing animal clues, Ferguson goes to Central Park, where the killer ambushes him in a tunnel. Wilson spends the remainder of his night with Neff where they have sex. The following morning, a man in a jogging suit rides Ferguson's motorcycle past Wilson as he leaves Neff's apartment. Whittington and Wilson stake out the church, armed with sniper rifles and sound equipment; after Whittington almost blows his ears out by opening a beer can near a parabolic microphone, an animal that appears to be a wolf kills him. Meanwhile, Executive Security apprehends a \"Götterdämmerung\" terrorist cell in connection with the Van der Veer slaying.\n\nA traumatized Wilson escapes the church and finds himself at the nearby Wigwam Bar, where Holt and his friends are drinking. The group of Natives reveal the true nature of the killer as \"Wolfen\", the wolf spirit. They explain that the Wolfen have extraordinary abilities and \"might be gods\". Holt tells Wilson that he cannot fight the Wolfen, stating: \"You don't have the eyes of the hunter, you have the eyes of the dead\". The leader of the group, the Old Indian, informs Wilson that Wolfen kill to protect their hunting ground. Wilson resolves to end his involvement in the Van der Veer case but he, Neff and Wilson's superior, Warren, are cornered on Wall Street by the Wolfen pack. Warren is decapitated while Wilson and Neff flee.\n\nWilson and Neff are cornered in Van der Veer's penthouse by the pack, led by its white alpha male. Wilson smashes the model of the construction project that threatened their hunting ground, trying to communicate that the threat no longer exists and that he and Neff are not enemies. The Wolfen vanish just as the police barge in. Wilson claims the attack was made by terrorists. In a voiceover, Wilson explains that Wolfen will continue preying on weak and isolated members of the human herd as humans do to each other through class conflict. Wolfen will continue being invisible to humanity because of their nature; not that of spirits but predators, who are higher on the food chain than humans. The last scene is Eddie and his friends looking at the city from the bridge.\n\n\nThe film is known for its early use of an in-camera effect to portray the subjective point of view of a wolf. Similar to thermography, the technique was later adopted by other horror films such as the \"Predator\" film series. The setting for the transient home of the wolves was shot in the South Bronx (intersection of Louis Nine Boulevard and Boston Road). The church seen in the opening panorama shot was located at the intersection of E 172nd Street and Seabury Place. The shot of this neighbourhood is from the north looking roughly south-south-east. The decrepit site of ruined buildings was no special effect. The church was built and burned exclusively for the film. Urban decay in the South Bronx in the early 1980s was so widespread that it was the ideal production setting.\n\nDustin Hoffman was interested in portraying the role of Dewey Wilson but Wadleigh insisted on Albert Finney. According to Roger Ebert, the film was originally to have been distributed by United Artists.\n\n\"Wolfen\" was released theatrically in the United States by Orion Pictures through Warner Bros. on July 24, 1981.

Warner Home Video would later re-release the film in 2004 and 2007, with the latter release being a part of its two-disk \"Horror: 4 Film Favorites\" pack. On June 2, 2015, it was released for the first time on Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Digital Distribution. It was later re-released on Blu-ray on August 27, 2019.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Wolfen\" holds a 75% approval rating based on 24 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.91/10. The consensus reads: “Police procedural meets werewolf flick in \"Wolfen\", a creepy creature feature with a surprisingly profound side.” On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it, \"an uncommonly intelligent treatment of a theme that is usually just exploited.\" There was some disagreement if \"Wolfen\" is about werewolves. \"Time Out\" called it a \"werewolf movie,\" but Roger Ebert asserted \"Wolfen\" \"is not about werewolves but is about the possibility that Indians and wolves can exchange souls.\"\n\n"}

There are many skyscrapers in Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar and Marina Bay CBD with a height limit of 280m. It is one of the eleven planning areas located within the most urbanised Central Area, forming the latter's dense urban core. It is bounded by Rochor to the north, Kallang to the northeast, Marina East and Marina South to the east, Straits View to the southeast, Bukit Merah to the south, as well as Outram, Museum and Singapore River to the west.\n\nAs the financial Heart of Singapore, the Downtown Core houses the headquarters and offices of numerous corporations, as well as the Singapore Exchange. The area is also home to many governmental institutions, notably the seat of Parliament and the Supreme Court of Singapore.\n\nSingapore's modern history began in this area, when Stamford Raffles and representatives of the British East India Company landed along the banks of the Singapore River to set up a free port in Southeast Asia. As the old harbour grew along the mouth of the river bank, the city naturally expanded around it, creating what is now the Central Area.\n\nThe name \"Downtown Core\" remains relatively unheard of and the term Central Business District (CBD) is commonly used in conversation instead. However, the area known as the CBD actually comprises a smaller area within the Downtown Core itself, taking up the south-western and western portions of the planning area. It is made up of eight subzones, Anson, Cecil, Clifford Pier, Maxwell, Phillip, Raffles Place and Tanjong Pagar and Marina Centre. The core of the CBD has since extended well beyond its boundaries and the term is even often at times used to refer to the Central Area as a whole.\n\nAs a fledgling colony, the area which is now known as the Downtown Core was the financial, administrative and commercial centre of the colony. In 1823, Singapore was reorganised according to the Raffles Plan of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles, which specified elements like the \"Commercial Square\" (now Raffles Place) and the \"European Town\" as well as various other commercial and administrative entities located between them. This area later became the Downtown Core.\n\n"}

The area covers the four unitary authorities of East Riding of Yorkshire, Hull, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire The constituency boundaries used up to the 2005 United Kingdom general election were drawn up when it was a county. The area is divided into 10 Parliamentary constituencies – 4 Borough constituencies and 6 County constituencies.\n\nThe Boundary Commission proposed retaining these 10 constituencies, with changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. These changes were implemented at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Humberside in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\n1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\n1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nData given here is for the East Riding of Yorkshire before 1983.

Records in the mid-1980s. Rough Cutt never achieved the commercial success enjoyed by many other Los Angeles bands of that time but various members went on to success in other groups, including Jake E. Lee with Ozzy Osbourne, Amir Derakh with Orgy, Paul Shortino with Quiet Riot, and Craig Goldy and Claude Schnell with Dio.\n\nAfter the end of their work with Warner Brothers, Rough Cutt signed with Virgin Records in the early 1990s. The band released its fourth studio album, Lapsed On My Own (1993), and toured steadily, playing festivals in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany.\n\nThe current line-up of Rough Cutt, which debuted on November 29, 2019 at the Bossanova Ballroom in Portland, Oregon is drummer Dave Alford, first guitarist Chris Hager, second guitarist Darren Housholder (Shrapnel Records recording artist, Love/Hate, War & Peace), bassist Jeff Buehner (The Loyal Order), and lead vocalist Steven St. James.\n\nThe first Rough Cutt line-up featured vocalist Paul Shortino, drummer Dave Alford, guitarist Jake E. Lee, keyboardist Claude Schnell, and bassist Joey Cristofanilli. Both Lee and Alford had also previously been in another Los Angeles band, Ratt. Both Schnell and Cristofanilli had previously been in the band Magic.\n\nTwo other former Ratt members and band mates in Sarge, guitarist Chris Hager and bassist Matt Thorne a.k.a. Matt Thorr (who replaced Cristofanilli) would also soon join Rough Cutt. After his departure, Cristofanilli temporarily joined Ratt himself, later joining forces with members of the band Sin who went on to release the album \"Made In Heaven\" under the name Jag Wire in 1985.\n\nLee left Rough Cutt in 1982, auditioned for, and was hired briefly by the band Dio, and then replaced the deceased Randy Rhoads as Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist. Lee in turn was replaced by Craig Goldy, formerly of the San Diego band Vengeance. Ronnie James Dio greatly influenced the development of the band. Dio's wife Wendy Dio was the group's manager, and Dio himself helped write one of the band's songs. Rough Cutt contributed two tracks, \"A Little Kindness\" and \"Used & Abused\", both produced by Dio and featuring Jake E Lee on guitar, to the compilation album \"L.A's Hottest Unsigned Bands\", issued in 1983. Another Dio-produced track, \"Try A Little Harder\", with Goldy on guitar featured on the \"KLOS 95 1/2: Rock to Riches\" compilation, along with another Wendy Dio project NuHaven, released later on in 1983. Goldy soon left the band, and went on to play in Giuffria, and later in Dio's band. Goldy was replaced by Amir Derakh, another San Diego band alumnus.\n\nWith the line-up solidified with Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne, Rough Cutt was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1984. The band gained national exposure when they appeared on the 'Rock Palace' TV show performing the songs \"Crank It Up\", \"Dreamin' Again\", \"Street Gang Livin'\", and \"Try A Little Harder.\" Hosted by comedian Howie Mandel, the recording took place on January 1, 1984 at the Hollywood Palace, now the Avalon Hollywood. Rough Cutt also made their way to Europe showcasing at London's famed Marquee Club on April 13, 1984 and playing a badly promoted show at the Fabrik in Hamburg, Germany, both well in advance of recording their first studio album.\n\nAfter waiting around for a year to work with producer Ted Templeman, who had signed the band to Warner Bros. but was busy with David Lee Roth, Eric Clapton and Aerosmith at the time, Rough Cutt decided to record their debut album, \"Rough Cutt\" (1985), with Tom Allom instead. The band toured extensively in the United States as an opening act supporting Krokus on their \"The Blitz\" tour, alongside Accept, followed by an extensive trek with Dio on their \"Sacred Heart\" tour, which lasted from August through December 1985. Rough Cutt were also part of the Super Rock '85 festival bill on August 10, 1985 at Odaiba-Undohiroba in Odaiba, Tokyo, Japan, sharing the stage with headliners Dio, Foreigner, Mama's Boys, Sting, and Japanese act, Earthshaker. The show was commemorated with a VHS release titled \"Super Rock In Japan '85\"; Rough Cutt was featured with four songs from their debut album, \"Black Widow\", \"Take Her\", \"Dreamin' Again\", and \"Piece of My Heart.\"\n\nVeteran producer Jack Douglas of Aerosmith fame guided the band's follow-up effort \"Wants You!\" (1986). Rough Cutt joined Dio on the last date of their \"Sacred Heart\" tour at the R.C. Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 10, 1986 and once again made their way to Japan. While in Japan, Shortino made the decision to leave the band due to internal differences about what direction their music should take, Rough Cutt's manager Wendy Dio introduced Shortino to Quiet Riot and engineered a deal for him to step in as their new lead singer in place of Kevin DuBrow who had been fired. Shortino was briefly replaced by Parramore McCarty of Warrior before Rough Cutt called it quits. Derakh, Thorne and Alford re-grouped with singer Danny Simon and guitarist Michael Raphael to form Jailhouse, releasing a live EP, \"Alive in a Mad World\", in 1989; while Hager would team up with Jeff Warner of Black 'N Blue in Woop & the Count. Thorne was also briefly a member of L.A. Rocks, renamed Eyes once vocalist James Christian entered the fray, while Derakh found major success with self-proclaimed death pop band Orgy in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1996, DeRock Records released \"Rough Cutt Live\" which contained three new studio cuts, \"House of Pain\", \"Prowler\", and \"Peyote\", as bonus tracks. The same label would also issue a full-length studio album by Rough Cutt offshoot Jailhouse in 1998, with all five songs from the 1989 \"Alive in a Mad World\" EP added as bonus tracks.\n\nShortino reformed Rough Cutt in 2000 with an all-new lineup that included former Aerosmith guitarist Jimmy Crespo, keyboardist James 'J.T.' Garrett, Shortino's former Quiet Riot bandmate bassist Sean McNabb, and Magnitude 9 drummer John Homan. The band announced the release of an EP, titled \"Sneak Peek\", in 2000 but it was canceled and expanded into a full length-album instead. \"Sacred Place\" was released in 2002 under the name Paul Shortino's The Cutt on Shortino's own MusicWorks Entertainment label and featured additional contributions by guitarists Brad Gillis, Carlos Cavazo, Howard Leese, and Dave Whiston as well as bassists Chuck Wright and Jason Boyleston.\n\nThe classic Warner Bros. era line-up of Rough Cutt reformed for a one-off reunion show in October 2002 at the Viper Room in Hollywood with Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne performing together once again.\n\nIn late 2005, Wounded Bird Records re-issued both Rough Cutt Warner Bros. studio albums as a two-for-one single disc, \"Rough Cutt/Rough Cutt Wants You\". British label Rock Candy re-issued remastered versions of both albums in 2016, complete with 16-page full color booklets, 3500 word essays about the making of the album with new band member interviews, and enhanced artwork.\n\nIn 2008, Deadline Records issued the double disc \"Anthology\" consisting of pre- and post-Warner Bros. era demos and a live set recorded in Syracuse, New York in 1985. In October 2019, 10 songs from the Fiddler's Studio Sessions portion of the \"Anthology\" were released as \"The Fiddler Sessions '84\" on limited edition red vinyl, with only 300 copies made.\n\nIn 2016, the classic lineup of Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne reunited again. They played on the Monsters of Rock cruise in 2018.\n\n2019 saw Shortino singing and playing lead guitar for Carlos Cavazo's Rough Riot and Alford and Hager began auditioning to complete the Rough Cutt line-up. After hiring vocalist Steven St. James, whom Hager had previously played with in Sarge in his pre-Rough Cutt days, the band added Buehner and then Housholder. After three rehearsals, the new Rough Cutt played its first live show as a band opening for L.A. Guns featuring Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis in Portland, Oregon at the Bossanova Ballroom on Black Friday, November 29, 2019. Rough Cutt closed its 10-song set by playing \"You Wanna Be A Star,\" a song written by Hager, St. James, and Alford. According to Alford in an interview after the performance, the song aired on an episode of the 1980s television series Fame (1982 TV series), and has not been played live by Rough Cutt since the 1980s when arena audiences of the time failed to appreciate it.\n\nRough Cutt is currently writing and recording new music and is in negotiations with an unnamed record label.\n\nFormer Rough Cutt bassist Matt Thorne most recently played rhythm guitar with the band Platinum Overdose whose debut album, \"Murder In High Heels\", was released on the Demon Doll label in August 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She had chart successes in the 1960s with her best known songs, \"Terry\" and \"Golden Lights\".\n\nBorn in Surbiton, Surrey into a well-to-do family, Ripley was known to her family as \"Twinkle\". She attended Queen's Gate School with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and was the aunt of actress Fay Ripley.\n\nTwinkle owed her rapid entry into the recording studio at the age of 16 to her then-boyfriend, Dec Cluskey, of the popular vocal group The Bachelors, who was introduced to her by her sister, music journalist Dawn James, and who passed on to his manager a demo that Twinkle's father played to him. Her song \"Terry\" was a teenage tragedy song about the death of a boyfriend in a motorcycle crash. Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page and Bobby Graham were among the high-profile star session musicians who played on the recording, which conjured up a dark mood with its doleful backing vocals, spooky organ, 12-string guitar and slow, emphatic rhythm arranged by Phil Coulter. The theme was of a common type for the era, it bore some similarities to the Shangri-Las' slightly earlier \"Leader of the Pack\" (1964), but the record caused a furore, accusations of bad taste leading to a ban from the BBC.\n\nThe follow-up, \"Golden Lights\", was also written by Twinkle, with a B-side again by producer Tommy Scott. By then Cluskey was her ex-boyfriend: Twinkle dated Peter Noone in 1965. The lyrics express disillusionment with the pop business: her EP track \"A Lonely Singing Doll\", the English-language version of France Gall's 1965 winning Eurovision Song Contest song for Luxembourg, \"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\", originally written by Serge Gainsbourg, returned to a theme similar to \"Golden Lights\". \"Johnny\" continued to explore dangerous territory, this time that of a childhood friend who becomes a criminal, but it seems the pressure to produce \"another Terry\" led her producers to pass over her own material, for \"Tommy\", a song written for Reparata and the Delrons and \"The End of the World\" a tune composed for Skeeter Davis. Twinkle made few live appearances but performed \"Terry\" at the annual New Musical Express hit concerts. After recording six singles for Decca Records she \"retired\" at the age of eighteen in 1966.\n\nIn 1969 she recorded a self-written single, the Tamla Motown-styled \"Micky\", backed by \"Darby and Joan\", both produced by Mike d'Abo (also among the relatively few pop musicians of a privileged background in that era) for the Immediate label. The single vanished, unpublicised. In the ensuing years, unsigned and working in music for advertising, she recorded a suite of songs inspired by her relationship with \"Micky\", the actor/model Michael Hannah, who was killed in an air-crash in 1974. These remained unreleased until they were included on CD compilations. Her later recordings appeared under the name Twinkle Ripley. She recorded a 1975 single, \"Smoochie\" with her father, Sidney Ripley as \"Bill & Coo\".\n\nIn the 1980s \"Golden Lights\" was covered by The Smiths and appeared on their compilation albums \"The World Won't Listen\" and \"Louder Than Bombs\" while in 1983 Cindy & The Saffrons covered \"Terry\".\n\nPhotographic publicity portraits of Twinkle taken in the mid-1960s are exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn 1972, she married actor-model Graham Rogers, who starred in the Milk Tray chocolate adverts. They had two children, Michael and Amber.\n\nOn 21 May 2015, Twinkle died at 66 on the Isle of Wight, after a five-year battle with liver cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He recorded the studio album \"Rising\" with them and played on their following world tour. While on the tour, he played on Rainbow's first live album, \"On Stage\". In January 1977, Bain was sacked from the band. He then toured Europe with John Cale.\n\nIn 1978, Bain formed a band called Wild Horses. Jimmy was the lead vocalist, songwriter, as well as bassist for the band, which also included ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, drummer Clive Edwards (Pat Travers, Uli Jon Roth's Electric Sun) and guitarist Neil Carter (who went on to UFO and Gary Moore). Wild Horses released two albums on EMI in Europe, \"Wild Horses\" (1980) and \"Stand Your Ground\" (1981), the latter featuring John Lockton (ex-The Next Band) in place of Carter, before Robertson and Edwards both left in June 1981. Robertson joined Motörhead the following year while Edwards joined former Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden's S.O.S.\n\nBain regrouped Wild Horses as a five-piece with ex-Lautrec members Reuben Archer (vocals) and Laurence Archer (guitar), and The Next Band's Frank Noon (drums), but they disbanded shortly after. Jimmy then worked with the former Family main-man Roger Chapman, Roy Harper, Gary Moore, and Kate Bush (on 1982's \"The Dreaming\").\n\nBain co-wrote with his close friend Phil Lynott for the Lizzy man's two solo albums. A keyboard player as well as a bassist, he toured the material playing keyboards with Lynott's band. Their song, \"Old Town\" was re-recorded by The Corrs in 1999, and became a big hit worldwide.\n\nHe was secretly brought in by the German hard rockers Scorpions to play bass guitar on their 1984 album \"Love at First Sting\". The leader of the band, rhythm guitarist Rudolf Schenker, wanted him to join the Scorpions as full-time bassist, but their management wanted to keep the line-up German, so Francis Buchholz was brought back and Bain's bass tapes were deleted.\n\nIn 1983, Bain linked up again with ex-Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio for the band Dio. A central figure within Dio, Bain co-wrote \"Rainbow in the Dark\", \"Holy Diver\" and two additional songs which appear on their 1983 released first album, \"Holy Diver\". Bain co-wrote several other songs for the following albums, \"The Last in Line\" (1984), \"Sacred Heart\" (1985), \"Intermission\" (1986), \"Dream Evil\" (1987) and \"Killing the Dragon\" (2002).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, when the entertainment community became active in drawing attention to world charities, Bain founded Hear 'n Aid, a foundation in which he could involve the rock community to help eliminate world hunger. He also co-wrote the song, \"Stars,\" with Vivian Campbell and Ronnie James Dio, which became the Heavy Rock world's answer to \"We Are The World\". \"Stars\" provided a major contribution to the famine relief charity appeal. Bain donated all of his shares of the proceeds to one of his favourite charities, Children of the Night.\n\nIn autumn 1989, Bain formed a band with vocalist Mandy Lion called World War III, but after their 1990 eponymous debut album, the band floundered. Bain's solo project \"The Key\" utilised a far more melodic and commercial approach. Guitarist on the project was Tracy G, borrowed from Dio's band, who was also the guitarist for World War III. Ronnie James Dio's concept project \"Magica\" (2000) saw Bain's return to the Dio lineup, and he played on the albums \"Magica\" and \"Killing the Dragon\".\n\nIn 2005, Bain again joined forces with former Black Sabbath and Dio drummer, Vinny Appice, for two projects, The Hollywood All Starz and 3 Legged Dogg. While the Hollywood All Starz performed live concerts featuring greatest hits sets of the individual members, (Carlos Cavazo of Quiet Riot was another notable member of the band), 3 Legged Dogg produced a well received album of original material. In an interview with journalist, David Lee Wilson, Bain lamented Appice's ultimate choice to leave both these groups so that he could tour with Ronnie James Dio in the Black Sabbath offshoot, Heaven and Hell.\n\nBain toured with Hollywood Allstarz, a supergroup featuring a number of 1980s metal stars. The group has included former members of Giuffria, Quiet Riot, and Lynch Mob. The band Last in Line was put together in 2013 comprising Bain, Viv Campbell, Vinny Appice, Claude Schnell and Andrew Freeman. That line-up (excluding singer Freeman) were the original songwriters and performers on the early classic Dio albums, and so intended to play gigs and to perform those songs. Bain was in court-mandated rehabilitation during the recording sessions for their album \"Heavy Crown\" with a curfew that ordered that he return daily before 10 p.m.\n\nIn 1979, Bain married Lady Sophia Crichton-Stewart, daughter of the 6th Marquess of Bute. They had one daughter, Samantha Ella Bain, born in 1981 (for whom Phil Lynott and John Sykes' song \"Samantha\" was written).\n\nOn 23 January 2016, Jimmy Bain died while in his cabin on Def Leppard's \"Hysteria on the High Seas\" cruise. He was due to perform on the cruise with his group Last In Line the following day. The performance did not go ahead, and band members informed fans on the cruise that he had been battling pneumonia for some time. The cause of death was determined to be lung cancer. Bain had not been diagnosed with cancer and was aware only of his pneumonia. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills), not far from his bandmate Ronnie James Dio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded at the mouth of the Vaza-Barris River on January 1, 1590, the municipality is the fourth oldest settlement in Brazil. São Cristóvão is noted for its historic city square, São Francisco Square, and numerous early colonial-period buildings. The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.\n\nSão Cristóvão covers , making it the third largest settlement in the state of Sergipe behind Aracaju and Nossa Senhora do Socorro. Its population is 85,814 (est. 2014) and has a population density of 196.43 per km2 (508.8/sq mi). São Cristóvão is home to the Federal University of Sergipe, which was established in 1968.\n\nSão Cristóvão was established by the Portuguese (in a time when Portugal, Spain and the Naples kingdoms were under the rule of Philip II of Spain) as one of the first colonization attempts in Sergipe, which makes the city the fourth oldest one in Brazil. In 1590 the Portuguese sent Cristóvão de Barros to both subjugate the region to colonial rule and establish a safe trading port between Salvador and Pernambuco. De Barros quickly and violently defeated the local population, which consisted of people of mixed Tupinambá and French heritage who maintained a trade in Brazilwood. As a symbol of his victory De Barros founded a small village named for his patron saint, Saint Christopher.\n\nThe development of the town followed the Portuguese urban model, that is, in two plans: the higher town, where the headquarters of the civil and religious powers are; and lower town, with the harbour, the factories, and the low income population. The economy of São Cristóvão initially depended on the establishment of cattle herds for meat, milk, and leather. The settlement was completely destroyed by the Dutch in 1637. Tobacco and sugarcane plantations were established in the 17th century, and remained into the modern period. São Cristóvão was the state capital until 1855, when the provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital to Aracaju.\n\nIn 1967, the city was designated a national monument to preserve its colonial architecture, and it is now home to ten national heritage sites of Brazil. Among the important sacred buildings are the Church and Convent of Santa Cruz (also known as the Church and Convent of São Francisco, which date from 1693), the Misericórdia Hospital and Church (Santa Casa de Misericordia, the 17th-century Sisters of Mercy hospital), the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (1751), the Parish Church of Our Lady of Victory (1608) and several other important churches from the 18th century, including the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men, the Church of Our Lady of Protection, and the Monastery of São Bento. Ten national or state heritage sites are located in or near the city center; two, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim and the Church of Our Lady of Nazareth of Engenho Itaperoá, are abandoned and on sugarcane plantations far from the city center.\n\nThe religious sites of São Cristóvão remain an important center of Roman Catholic pilgrimage in Brazil. The Museum of Sacred Art of the Church and Convent of São Francisco is considered the third most important in Brazil.\n\nSão Francisco Square (Praça São Francisco) is an open space surrounded by colonial-period buildings such as the São Francisco Church and convent, the Church and Santa Casa da Misericórdia, the Provincial Palace and other buildings from later periods. The complex is a well-preserved example of typical Franciscan architecture of north-eastern Brazil. On August 1, 2010 the site, which covers , was selected as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is managed by a regional office of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and the municipal government.\n\nChurches\n\n\nResidences\n\n\nRural chapels\n\n\nThe city is a shipping port, and its main industries are sugar milling and distilling.\n"}

It is on the right bank of the Yamuna. It is situated 78 kilometres south-west of Kanpur from which it is connected by both road and rail.\n\nIt is believed that the city was known as Kalap dev ki kalpi in ancient times, later abbreviated to Kalpi. Kalpi is also known as the birthplace of Sage Vyasa, the writer of the Mahabharata and Puranas. He collected the chants of Vedas and assembled them in an arranged manner. Kalpi is said to have been founded by King Vasudeva at the end of the 4th century BCE.\n\nIn 1196 it fell to Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the viceroy of Mohammed Ghori, and during the subsequent Muslim period it played a significant part in the history of central India. During Akbar's reign, Kalpi was a governor's seat and had a mint for copper coinage. The witty Raja Birbal of Akbar's court is considered to be born near this city. About the middle of the 18th century it passed into the hands of the Marathas.\n\nThe town was captured by the British in 1803, and after 1806 remained in British possession until India's independence in 1947. Kalpi was a part of Bundelkhand Agency, formed in 1811, and also housed its headquarters from 1818 to 1824. During this period the political agent to Governor General of India was appointed and headquartered in Kalpi. The British East India Company made it one of their principal stations for providing \"commercial investment\". In May 1858 Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn) defeated here a force of Indian rebels led by the Rani of Jhansi. The fortified post of Kalpi, the former residence of the rulers of Jalaun State, was dismantled in 1860 by the British and its place was taken by a market known as Whiteganj.\nThere are many places for visiting like Vyas temple, Lanka Meenar, 84 Gumbaj and lots of Dargah like Khankah the Dargah of Sayyad Meer Tirmiji.

The spiritual guru of Kashi Math Samsthan Shri Sudhindra Thirtha swami had his vision to set this temple right at the birthplace of Veda Vyasa in 1998. It is also a popular tourist attraction in the region\n\nKalpi is still a centre of local trade (principally in grain, ghee and cotton) with a station on the North Central Railway (India) line from Jhansi to Kanpur, which crosses the Yamuna here. In late 1970s and early 1980s, Kalpi was one of the areas in central India affected by dacoits, and was frequented by the much dreaded Phoolan Devi gang.

Century High School is one of three public high schools in Rochester. The school mascot is the Panther, and school colors are navy blue and silver. The most recent major ranking of Century High School - conducted by U.S. News & World Report - gave Century a \"Silver\" designation based on U.S. News ranking criteria, and placed it in the Top 1000 schools nationwide.\n\nThe property was purchased from the Cassidy family in 1996, whose family had owned that property for 105 years. The school's name was selected after a contentious process that began with a citizen's committee of 80 people who started with 204 names. After a five-hour meeting they settled on two possible names, Eleanor Roosevelt and Century. Century referred to the Cassidy farm which had been in the same family for over 100 years. Eleanor Roosevelt is a former first lady who was in the news in 1996 after remarks by Hillary Clinton. The two names were forwarded to the School Board for the final decision. . Rochester was still a conservative community with many citizens not interested in selecting a liberal figure. An informal poll by the local newspaper showed a 2 to 1 preference for Century. After a forty-minute debate by the School Board, the members voted 4 to 3 for Century, citing a poll by elementary and junior-high students that showed a clear preference for that name.

It was first shown on BBC1 on 26 January 1975.\n\nIt was filmed in 1974 when Bowie was struggling with cocaine addiction, and the documentary has become notorious for showing his mental state during this period.\n\nThe documentary depicts Bowie on tour in Los Angeles, using a mixture of documentary sequences filmed in limousines and hotels, and concert footage. Most of the concert footage was taken from a show at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 2 September 1974. There were also excerpts from D. A. Pennebaker's concert film \"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which had been shot at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973, as well as a few other performances from the tour. \"Cracked Actor\" is notable for being a source for footage of Bowie's ambitious Diamond Dogs Tour.\n\nThe title of the documentary was originally to be \"The Collector\", after a comment that Bowie had made to interviewer Russell Harty the previous year, whereby he described himself as \"a collector of accents\". Yentob and his team were given the task of documenting Bowie's famous \"Diamond Dogs\" tour, which was already underway when they started filming. Locations for the documentary mainly centred on Hollywood and Los Angeles, but there was also concert footage taken from Philadelphia. A number of performances from the tour were shown, including the songs \"Space Oddity\", \"Cracked Actor\", \"Sweet Thing/Candidate\", \"Moonage Daydream\", \"The Width of a Circle\", \"Aladdin Sane\", \"Time\", \"Diamond Dogs\" and \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\".\n\nThe tour and film coincided with a prolific time in Bowie's recording and acting career. During the summer of 1974, Bowie started recording at Sigma Studios Philadelphia for what became the \"Young Americans\" LP. He was about to commence work on \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" film – the film's soundtrack was possibly due to be \"Station to Station\" but was later shelved. Photos from Bowie in the US in 1974 on tour and recording, of which some sequences can be seen in \"Cracked Actor\", have been used elsewhere, including the cover of \"David Live\" and inserts for the Rykodisc and anniversary booklets for the CD pressings of the LPs that include \"Young Americans\".\n\nIn 1987, while working on his album \"Never Let Me Down\", Bowie reflected in an interview about his state of mind during the time the film was made:\nIn 2013, Alan Yentob said of the film: \"I'd caught him at what was an intensely creative time, but it was also physically and emotionally gruelling. Our encounters tended to take place in hotel rooms in the early hours of the morning or in snatched conversations in the back of limousines. He was fragile and exhausted but also prepared to open up and talk in a way he had never really done before.” \n\nThe documentary remains officially unreleased though there are bootleg video copies circulating as a result of the programme being shown again by the BBC in the early 1990s and more recently in 2007 and 2008.\n\n"}

It houses the Parliament of Singapore, and is located in the Civic District of the Downtown Core within the Central Area. Within its vicinity is Raffles Place, which lies across from the Parliament House from the Singapore River, and the Supreme Court's building across the road. The building was designed to represent a contemporary architectural expression of stateliness and authority. The prism-shaped top, designed by former president Ong Teng Cheong, was similarly a modernist take on the traditional dome.\n\nThe space constraints faced by the Old Parliament House were felt since the early 1980s, when the members of parliament grew from 51 in 1963 to 75 in 1983, a point made by then Leader of the House, Edmund William Barker during a parliamentary debate on 16 March 1983. The old building had been renovated several times to accommodate the demand for space, but there was a limit as to how much the building could be widened without disrupting the Chamber's configuration and causing discomfort to its members. The debate concluded in 1989, when the First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the idea to build a new parliament house.\n\nThe project started in earnest in May 1989, when a project team was formed to design and build the new house. Headed by Liu Thai Ker, CEO and Chief Planner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), it comprised architects and engineers from the URA and the Public Works Department (PWD). Various designs were put forth by PWD architects for the new site next to the existing parliament house, led by PWD Director Chua Hua Meng and Deputy Director Lee Kut Cheung.\n\nIn 1992, the project was approved by the government with a budget of S$148.2 million. The following year, the Committee on the Parliament Complex Development Project was established, headed by the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon, and with Wong Kan Seng, Lee Boon Yang, and Lim Hng Kiang as its members. Tasked to liaise with architects in the planning and construction of the building, the committee members also went on two overseas study missions to gather ideas to be incorporated into the building's design. The first trip was made to Australia, where visits were made to the newly built Parliament House in Canberra. Here, extensive attention was paid to public education of the parliamentary system in the form of galleries, moot parliaments. A second visit was made to Europe, to incorporate contrasting older, traditional ideas into the building's design.\n\nWith these ideas incorporated, the new building's concept plan was approved by the Cabinet in 1994. Construction began in 1995 on the expunged Hallpike Street under the direction of PWD Director Chua Hua Meng and Deputy Director Tan Chee Wee, and was completed in July 1999 at a cost of S$115.2 million.\n\nOn 6 September 1999, the flag of Singapore was lowered for the last time at the old Parliament House, before the ceremonial \"walk over\" was conducted from the old building to the new. Led by the Speaker of Parliament and the Prime Minister, the entourage of MPs walked along Parliament Place, a renamed segment of High Street, Singapore, before reaching the new Parliament House where the flag was unfurled and hoisted with the national anthem being played. The entourage then filed into the new Chamber, where the parliamentary debate resumed. On 4 October 1999, the building was officially opened with a simple ceremony held at the building's foyer, where a stainless steel plaque was unveiled before 100 MPs and invited guests.\n\nThe new Parliament House was designed by the Public Works Department, and comprises three new blocks (Chamber Block, Front Block and Public Block) integrated with an existing restored building built in 1864 and which once housed the Attorney-General's Chambers. This block was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992. The building was built not only as a venue for parliamentary debates, but also a research centre and meeting place for the members of parliament (MPs), as well as a place of interest for students and the general public.\n\nDue to its setting in the richly historical area, the building's overall design harks back to its more historical neighbours with its slate grey external colour scheme and liberal use of accentuated columns reflective of the colonnade design common in classical architecture.\n\nThe main entrance from North Bridge Road is preceded by a grand ceremonial driveway flanked by palm trees, an iconic tree peculiar to the tropical region and complemented by fountain pools. The building's grand foyer is topped by the timber atrium, seen from the outside as the building's signature prism-shaped pinnacle.\n\nWith 100 seats and room for 20 more, the new Chamber features contemporary IT features like an electronic voting system, an integrated congress system, IT terminals and so on. Generous space is devoted to the Strangers' Gallery and the Press Gallery, allowing for more members of the public to observe proceedings. In addition, a new sound-proofed Educational Gallery was built on the top floor of the chamber allowing for staff and teachers to verbally explain live parliamentary proceedings to students, as well as a moot parliament, history corner, and multimedia information kiosks to provide a full educational programme, as is the case in the Parliament House in Canberra.\n\nAlso part of the new building are a 170-seat auditorium, a library, range of meeting and IT rooms and media facilities, a dining room, a 100-seat public cafeteria and even a gymnasium. Car parking is available below ground, leaving much valuable space above to include lush landscaping and a 2,770 square metre garden.\n\n\n"}

Guns. He was born on 9 January 1957 in London, England. He has lived and worked in the U.S. since the 1980s but was privately educated at Royal Russell School in Surrey, England.\n\nLewis started the band Girl with guitarist Gerry Laffy in 1978. They put an advertyisement in \"Melody Maker\" for a \"peroxide guitar hero,\" and Phil Collen (current guitarist of Def Leppard) answered. They were soon joined by drummer Dave Gaynor and bassist Mark Megary. Megary was replaced shortly thereafter by Laffy's brother, Simon Laffy. They signed a record deal with Don Arden’s label, Jet Records in 1979 and released their first album, \"Sheer Greed\", in 1980. Lewis's then girlfriend, Britt Ekland, was instrumental in helping Girl land their record deal. Later band members included Pete Barnacle, Bryson Graham, and Pete Bonas. They released their second album, \"Wasted Youth\" in 1982. Phil Collen left the band in 1982 to join Def Leppard, and the band broke up shortly thereafter. Their third and final album, \"Killing Time\", was released in 1997. It consisted of leftover material from the first two albums as well as tracks that were written for an album that never materialized.\n\nLewis later joined forces with guitarist Rudy Rivera, bassist Dave Birch, and drummer Paul Edwards to start the band New Torpedos. They released a demo tape.\n\nLewis left New Torpedos to join the band Tormé with guitarist Bernie Tormé. They signed a record deal with Zebra Records and released \"Back to Babylon\" in 1986 and \"Die Pretty, Die Young\" in 1987. They toured both albums with modest success but never quite managed win over mainstream audiences.\n\nShortly after leaving Tormé, Lewis received a call from guitarist Tracii Guns stating that he was interested in having Phil join his band, L.A. Guns. The two met on 1 April 1987, and Lewis was hired shortly thereafter. L.A. Guns soon signed a record deal with Polygram Records and released their first album, \"L.A. Guns\", on 4 January 1988. The band achieved mainstream success with their second album, \"Cocked & Loaded\", thanks in part due to the successful single, \"The Ballad of Jayne.\" They released \"Hollywood Vampires\" in 1991, which also had moderate success. Due to the rise in popularity of the grunge movement, the band would not release their fourth album, \"Vicious Circle\" until 1994. That album did not achieve the success of the prior albums, so Lewis left the band shortly after its release.\n\nDuring his time out of L.A. Guns, Lewis participated in several other music projects including Filthy Lucre with Steve Dior and the Liberators. Filthy Lucre released an album called \"Popsmear\" in 1997. During this time, he also held various other jobs including producing albums for other artists, mixing audio for Fox Sports, and even working as a telephone psychic for a short time.\n\nLewis returned to L.A. Guns in 1999. The classic lineup released a re-recorded version of the hit album \"Cocked and Loaded\" in 2000. This updated version was called \"Cocked & Re-Loaded\". The band released a new album entitled \"Man In The Moon\" in 2001. They released \"Waking The Dead\" in April 2002. It was the first album with producer Andy Johns and would also prove to be the last with Tracii Guns, as he left the band a few months later to team up with Nikki Sixx for the band Brides of Destruction. Guns’ departure forced the band to pull out of a world tour with Alice Cooper, and they were soon dropped from their label as well.\n\nLewis and drummer Steve Riley continued to tour as L.A. Guns after Tracii Guns’ departure and have released two more original albums, \"Tales from the Strip\" in 2005 and \"Hollywood Forever\" in 2012.\n\nIn December 2016, Lewis announced that he would be leaving the current lineup of L.A. Guns. He also announced that he will be joining Tracii Guns in a new L.A. Guns lineup. The new lineup consists of Phil Lewis, Tracii Guns, Michael Grant, Johnny Martin, and Shane Fitzgibbon.

Guns album \"Hollywood Forever\".\n\nLewis is a contributor to the 80s metal music website \"Metal Sludge\", under the online handle \"Al Snug\".\n\nLewis sang on a cover of Def Leppard's \"Bringin' on the Heartbreak\" on the Def Leppard tribute album \"Leppardmania\".

{"id": "1999824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999824", "title": "Upper Saxon German", "text": "Upper Saxon German\n\nUpper Saxon (, ; ) is an East Central German dialect spoken in much of the modern German State of Saxony and in the adjacent parts of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. Linguistically speaking, it is a \"regiolect\" or \"regional vernacular\" rather than a dialect in the strict sense. Though colloquially called \"Saxon\" (), it is not to be confused with the Low Saxon dialect group in Northern Germany. Upper Saxon is closely linked to the Thuringian dialect spoken in the adjacent areas to the west.\n\nThe Upper Saxon dialect evolved as a new variety in the course of the medieval German \"Ostsiedlung\" (eastern colonisation) from about 1100 onwards. Settlers descending from the stem duchies of Saxony, Franconia, Bavaria as well as Thuringia and Flanders, moved into the Margravate of Meissen between the Elbe and Saale rivers, formerly populated by Polabian Slavs. As the colonists belonged to different German tribes, speaking different dialects, Upper Saxon became an intermediary, koiné dialect (\"Kolonialdialekt\" or \"Ausgleichsdialekt\"), having less distinct features than the older, more original dialects.\n\nUpper Saxon dialect needs to be distinguished from the \"chancery language\" of Saxony \"(Meißner Kanzleisächsisch)\". This was the official, literary language of the Margravate of Meissen (respectively the Electorate of Saxony after 1423), replacing Latin as the language of administrators during the period of Renaissance humanism (15th to 16th century). It was less influenced by Upper German features than the Habsburg chancery language, and thus intelligible to speakers of both Upper and Low German dialects. In the context of the Bible translation by Martin Luther, it played a large part in the development of the Early New High German language as a standard variety.\n\nDue to the influence and prestige of the Electorate of Saxony during the Baroque era (17th to 18th century), and especially its role as a focal point of artists and scientists, the language of the Upper Saxon elite (but not of its ordinary people) was considered the exemplary variant of German during that period. The literary theorist Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766), who spent most of his adult life in Leipzig, considered Saxony's upper-class speech as the guiding form of standard German. When Johann Christoph Adelung (1732–1806) published his High German dictionary (\"Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der hochdeutschen Mundart\"), he made clear that \"High German\"—to him—meant the parlance of educated Upper Saxons. He claimed that the Upper Saxon variety was to the German language what Attic was to Greek and Tuscan to Italian. One motive of the parents of German national poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749–1832; a native of Frankfurt) to send him to study in Leipzig was to adopt a more sophisticated language.\n\nWith Saxony's loss of political power after the Seven Years' War (1756–63), its dialect lost prestige as well. In 1783, philosopher Johann Erich Biester, residing in the Prussian capital of Berlin, rated the \"unpleasant singsong\" and \"highly peculiar confusion of b and p, of d and t\"—even among upper-class speakers—\"very crude\".\n\nAccording to linguist Beat Siebenhaar, Upper Saxon dialect—defined as a cohesive linguistic system with its own, clear rules for pronunciation, word formation and syntax—became largely extinct during the second half of the 19th to early 20th century. Since then, (Upper) Saxon merely refers to a colloquial, regional variety of Standard German and not a dialect in the proper sense.\n\nSpoken by leading communists descending from the Central German industrial area like Walter Ulbricht, the Upper Saxon dialect was commonly perceived as the colloquial language of East Germany by West German citizens and up to today is a subject of numerous stereotype jokes. The mildly derogatory verb \"sächseln\" means \"to speak with a Saxon accent\".\n\nThe most notable distinguishing feature of the dialect is that the letters \"o\" and \"u\" are pronounced as centralized vowels ( and , respectively, when short; and , respectively, when long). Speakers of other German dialects that do not have these sounds tend to perceive these sounds as being \"ö\" and \"ü\" respectively. For example, they hear 'grandma' as if written \"Öma\" (Standard \"Oma\" ). Front rounded vowels are pronounced as non-rounded (\"ö\" = , \"ü\" = ). Final \"-er\" is pronounced (or similarly, depending on the subdialect), which speakers of other German dialects tend to hear as ; e.g. 'higher' (Standard \"höher\") is misheard as if written \"he(h)o\".\n\nThe Upper Saxon dialects \"outside\" the Ore Mountains can be easily recognized by the supposed \"softening\" (lenition) of the voiceless stop consonants and . Speakers of other dialects hear these as if they were \"b\", \"d\" and \"g\" respectively. In reality, these are merely non-aspirated versions of the same and , a widespread feature among Central German dialects, as opposed to strongly aspirated , and in dominant German dialects.\n\nThe degree of accent varies from place to place, from a relatively mild accent in the larger cities such as Dresden, Chemnitz or Leipzig to a stronger form in rural areas, depending on the grade of the High German consonant shift: \n\n\n"}

During the 2010 WWE Draft on the April 26 episode of \"Raw\", The Hart Dynasty, accompanied by Natalya and Hart, defeated ShoMiz to win the Unified Tag Team Championship, when Kidd made The Miz submit to the Sharpshooter.\n\nThe following day, all three members of The Hart Dynasty were moved to the Raw brand as part of the Supplemental Draft. On the May 10 episode of \"Raw\", he was defeated by Chris Jericho, granting Jericho and The Miz a shot for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship at Over the Limit, but The Hart Dynasty were able to retain. The following night, on May 24, they were attacked by The Usos (Jimmy and Jey) and Tamina, provoking a feud. At Fatal 4-Way, The Hart Dynasty defeated The Usos and Tamina in a six-person mixed tag team match when Natalya pinned Tamina, and Smith and Kidd defeated The Usos at Money in the Bank to retain the championships when Smith made Jimmy Uso submit to the Sharpshooter. At Night of Champions, The Hart Dynasty lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre in a Tag Team Turmoil match which also involved The Usos, Vladimir Kozlov and Santino Marella, and the team of Evan Bourne and Mark Henry.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to regain the championship, in which Kidd was pushed off balance during their double-team Hart Attack move, Kidd and Smith began to have a falling out with one another. This culminated on the November 15 episode of \"Raw\", when Kidd refused to tag in and attacked Smith during a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship against The Nexus (Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater). ending their partnership. On the December 2 episode of \"WWE Superstars\", Smith beat Kidd in a singles match. Afterward, Smith offered to shake Kidd's hand, but Kidd slapped him across the face. On the next episode of \"Raw\", Kidd defeated Smith in a rematch.\n\nAfter losing to Kidd, Smith would be restricted to appearing on \"Superstars\", mostly participating in tag team matches with Yoshi Tatsu or Darren Young. Smith's last match was on the April 28 edition of \"Superstars\", where he lost to Zack Ryder. After months of inactivity, Smith was released from his contract with WWE on August 5, 2011.\n\nOn an episode of WWE's online talk show, the Bump, Smith would appear live via webcam, appearing alongside former Hart Dynasty partner Tyson Kidd.

On January 19, in their first defence of the titles they lost to two members of RDX, Scott Steiner and Abyss. On January 20, Smith teamed up with Chavo, Jwala, Mahabali Veera and Matt Morgan to take on Abyss, Deadly Danda, Scott Steiner, Sir Brutus Magnus and Sonjay Dutt in World Cup Of Ring Ka King steel cage match and won.\nOn January 29, 2012, Smith made an appearance for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), teaming with Davey Richards in a tag team match, where they were defeated by The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson).\n\nOn January 13, 2012, Smith defeated The Almighty Sheik and Kevin Steen to become the first Heavyweight Champion of Resistance Pro Wrestling promotion. Over the next few months, Smith would take on Rhino in various matches culminating on May 11, in a steel cage match with special referee Raven which once again Smith would win. However, the title was stripped on October 14, 2012.\n\nOn August 13, 2012, New Japan Pro Wrestling announced that Smith would be returning to the promotion the following month as a member of Minoru Suzuki's Suzuki-gun stable, forming a regular tag team with stablemate Lance Archer. Smith said that New Japan wanted a huge monster as Archer's partner. Also, he received a good offer from All Japan Pro Wrestling, but he chose NJPW due to the previous relationship. Smith wrestled his return match on September 7, when he, Lance Archer, Minoru Suzuki and Taka Michinoku were defeated in an eight-man tag team match by Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima, Togi Makabe and Yuji Nagata, following a disqualification.

During the attack, K.E.S. beat down GHC Tag Team Champions TMDK (Mikey Nicholls and Shane Haste). This led to a match on February 11, where K.E.S. defeated TMDK to become the new GHC Tag Team Champions. In May, K.E.S. made it to the finals of the 2015 Global Tag League, where they were defeated by Masato Tanaka and Takashi Sugiura. After ten successful title defenses, K.E.S. lost the GHC Tag Team Championship to Naomichi Marufuji and Toru Yano on May 28, 2016. K.E.S. regained the title from Marufuji and Yano on November 23. They lost the title to Go Shiozaki and Maybach Taniguchi on December 3. Two days later, it was announced that Suzuki-gun was gone from Noah, concluding the invasion storyline.\n\nThe entire Suzuki-gun returned to NJPW on January 5, 2017, attacking the Chaos stable with K.E.S. targeting IWGP Tag Team Champions Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano. On February 5 at The New Beginning in Sapporo, K.E.S. unsuccessfully challenged Ishii and Yano for the IWGP Tag Team Championship in a three-way match, also involving Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma. K.E.S. were primed for a run as NJPW's top foreign tag team, but the plan was changed when Archer was forced to undergo surgery on a herniated disc in his back. Following Archer's return to NJPW in August, he and Smith defeated War Machine and Guerrillas of Destiny in a three-way tornado tag team match on September 24 at Destruction in Kobe to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. At the end of the year, K.E.S. took part in the 2017 World Tag League, where they finished with a record of five wins and two losses, failing to advance to the finals due to losing to block winners Guerrillas of Destiny in their head-to-head match. On January 4, 2018, at Wrestle Kingdom 12 in Tokyo Dome, K.E.S. lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to \"Los Ingobernables de Japon\" (Evil and Sanada).\n\nSmith would work in NJPW during the following year, usually in multi-man matches. He lost against Toru Yano in the first round of the 2018 New Japan Cup and faced the IWGP Tag Team Champions Los Ingobernables de Japon at Wrestling Honokuni. Smith and Archer participated in the 2018 World Tag League, but they failed to win the tournament. He would lose again against Toru Yano in the first round of the 2019's New Japan Cup. On June 15, 2019, it was reported that Smith would no longer be wrestling for NJPW.\n\nIn 2018 Smith begun wrestling for Major League Wrestling as a member of New Era Hart Foundation with Teddy Hart and Brian Pillman Jr. Their first feud was against the team of Rich Swann and ACH, whom they defeated on an episode of \"Fusion\" resulting in a concussion for Swann. On the November 2, edition of \"Fusion\" the Hart Foundation beat ACH, Swann and Marko Stunt in six-man tag team match. From there they begun feuding with the MLW World Tag Team Champions Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Fenix). On January 2, 2019, it was revealed Smith signed a multi-year deal with Major League Wrestling. In the company's statement, they said he would continue to compete in Japan. At SuperFight on February 2, Smith and Hart defeated Lucha Brothers for the MLW World Tag Team Championship. On July 6, Hart and Pillman Jr. lost the titles to The Dynasty (MJF and Richard Holliday) in a ladder match, which aired on the July 13 episode of \"Fusion\".\n\nSmith will be debuting for AJPW in the 2020 Champion Carnival.\n\nSmith lists his father, his uncles Bret Hart and Owen Hart, Shawn Michaels and Chris Benoit as his influences. He also cites Ted DiBiase as a big influence. Smith appeared on an episode of \"Hogan Knows Best\".\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Smith announced he acquired the trademark to the \"British Bulldog\" moniker famously used by his father, and subsequently began wrestling as \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith Jr.\n\nSmith was involved in a minor controversy over steroids, when, discussing how his father's drug abuse contributed to his death, Smith commented \"I hope to be as big as him someday\", leading to concerns over Smith using steroids. Smith claimed that the remarks were taken out of context and that he had learned from his father's mistakes. On April 7, 2018, at a WrestleCon event in New Orleans, Louisiana, Smith threw a cup of coffee at Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts' face during a verbal argument before fleeing the scene. According to Smith, Roberts refused to apologize for comments he made about his father. Smith was wanted by the New Orleans Police Department for battery, however Roberts later dropped the charges after Smith apologized and they spoke in person.\nSmith likes to cook in his free time. His speciality dishes are Sushi and Chankonabe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1999877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999877", "title": "Co-option", "text": "Co-option\n\nCo-option (also co-optation, sometimes spelled coöption or coöptation) has two common meanings. It may refer to the process of adding members to an elite group at the discretion of members of the body, usually to manage opposition and so maintain the stability of the group. Outsiders are ‘co-opted’ by being given a degree of power on the grounds of their élite status, specialist knowledge, or potential ability to threaten essential commitments or goals (\"formal co-optation\"). \n\nIn a classic 1979 article for \"Harvard Business Review\", consultants John Kotter and Leonard Schlesinger presented co-optation as a \"form of manipulation\" for dealing with employees who are resistant to new management programs: \n\nCo-opting an individual usually involves giving him or her a desirable role in the design or implementation of the change. Co-opting a group involves giving one of its leaders, or someone it respects, a key role in the design or implementation of a change. This is not a form of participation, however, because the initiators do not want the advice of the co-opted, merely his or her endorsement.\n\nCo-optation may take place in many other contexts, such as a technique by a dictatorship to control opposition.\n\nCo-optation also refers to the process by which a group subsumes or acculturates a smaller or weaker group with related interests; or, similarly, the process by which one group gains converts from another group by replicating some aspects of it without adopting the full program or ideal (\"informal co-optation\"). Co-optation is associated with the cultural tactic of recuperation, and is often understood to be synonymous with it.\n\nTwo common uses of co-option are firstly, to recruit members who have specific skills or abilities needed by the group which are not available among existing members. Secondly, to fill vacancies which could not be filled by the usual process (normally election), e.g. if suitable candidates appear subsequently. Co-opted members may or may not have the same rights as the elected members of a group (such as the right to vote on motions), depending on the rules of the group. Sociologist William Gamson defined co-optation as \"challengers gaining access to the public policy process but without achieving actual policy changes.\" \n\nIf a group is elected or appointed based on its members representing specific constituencies, co-option to fill vacancies is inappropriate, as a member selected by existing members will not necessarily represent the interests of the group represented by the vacating member. In this case, vacancies may be filled via a mechanism specified in its rules, such as a by-election. Examples are:\n\nSociologist Philip Selznick, in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), described this form as \"formal co-optation\" (he used the term \"cooptation\"). \n\nThis is arguably a derivation from the first sense. The outcome of such co-option will be specific to the individual case, and will depend on the relative strength of the co-opting and co-opted groups, the degree of alignment of their interests, and the vigour with which their members are prepared to pursue those interests. For example, when corporations greenwash their brands by co-opting the tone of environmentalism without any deep reform of their environmental impact, both environmental advocates and the general public must decide how to engage (or not) with the greenwashed result (accept it wholly, boycott it, apply pressure from another angle, ignore it, or some other path).\n\nSelznick, again in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority, described this form as \"informal co-optation\", although the process he describes is almost indistinguishable from the corrupt sale of political influence.\n\n"}

The song was featured on the and in the video game \"Rock Band 4\".\n\n\"Spiders\", like many of System of a Down's songs, is written in the key of C minor. The song relies heavily on the Cm, B♭, and E♭ chords, as well as Fm, Gm, A♭, B, and D♭. \"Spiders\" uses 4/4 time at a slow tempo, and employs drum-rolls and syncopation in the verses. The music can be described as haunting, ominous, dark, frightening, and depressing with its dark melody and echoing vocal overdubs. Serj Tankian's vocals, while low and melodic in the verses, become more energetic and dissonant in the refrains. The song's minor-key intro serves as a musical motif for the rest of the song; it repeats throughout the song in its normal and raised third forms. After the second refrain, Daron Malakian delivers a solo bridge that creates harmonic tension with its B and D♭ (non-key) chords. The song ends with a soft vocal version of the intro motif.\n\nA music video was directed by Charlie Deaux. Recently, a second version of the video has surfaced on video sharing websites such as YouTube, featuring a more coherent timeline and more footage of the band compared to the other actors.\n\n"}

{"id": "1999892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999892", "title": "Dutch Low Saxon", "text": "Dutch Low Saxon\n\nDutch Low Saxon (; Dutch Low Saxon: \"Nederlaands Leegsaksies\") are the Low Saxon dialects that are spoken in the northeastern Netherlands and are written there with local, unstandardised orthographies based on Standard Dutch orthography. The UNESCO Atlas of endangered languages lists the language as vulnerable. The percentage of speakers among parents dropped from 34% in 1995 to 15% in 2011. The percentage of speakers among their children dropped from 8% to 2% in the same period.\n\nThe classification of Dutch Low Saxon is not unanimous. From a diachronic point of view, the Dutch Low Saxon dialects are merely the West Low German dialects native to areas in the Netherlands, as opposed to areas beyond the national border with Germany. Some Dutch Low Saxon dialects like Tweants show features of Westphalian, a West Low German dialect spoken in adjacent Northern Germany.\n\nFrom a strictly synchronic point of view, however, some linguists classify Dutch Low Saxon as a variety of Dutch. Also, as a practical matter, Dutch Low Saxon, since the 17th century, has been influenced by Standard Dutch, but the Low Saxon dialects in Germany are influenced by Standard German. Recent studies have, however, shown that mutual intelligibility is not necessarily impaired and that the basis remains the same.\nShortly after the Second World War, linguists claimed that speaking a dialect other than the standard language would impair children's (language) learning abilities. In combination with a generally condescending attitude by the upper classes of Dutch society and the media towards speakers of Low Saxon varieties (or in fact anything different from Standard Dutch), that goaded many parents to stop passing the language on to their children. It also brought about a general opinion among speakers of Low Saxon that having the slightest accent, in Dutch, would reduce job opportunities and social status.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the language decline inspired many to form dialect preservation circles and groups, such as the Tweants \"Kreenk vuur de Twentse Sproake\" (Circle for the Twents language) or the Drèents \"Huus van de Taol\" (House of the Language). Many of them were mainly interested in preserving rather than promoting the language. The prevailing tone was one of melancholy and nostalgia. Their focus was often on preserving cultural traits considered typical to speakers of the language, such as rural life and traditional practices, crafts and costumes. That merely confirmed many of the existing stereotypes about speakers of the language.\n\nAnother tone was rather literary in nature. Though well-intended, it caused even more estrangement with younger generations.\n\nAt the same time, knowledge of and appreciation for related varieties was poor, which stifled cooperation between most of the dialect preservation groups. Instead of forming an organisation to stand together and help one another to improve the status for all the different varieties, fiery discussions arose about whether the long open or open-mid back rounded vowel (pronounced or , depending on the dialect) should be written as either 'oa' or 'ao'. That resulted in little co-operation and no nationwide coordination.\n\nOther attempts to unite the different dialect circles were met with cynicism. The conception prevailed that the dialects were too different to unite.\n\nIn 1975, the rock 'n' roll band Normaal boldly shook all perceptions of Low Saxon and its speakers. Until then, Low Saxon was mostly restricted to traditional folklore music. Normaal openly denounced all Dutch disdain, praised farmers and local farm life and boldly used Achterhooks Low Saxon, voicing the opinion and feelings of many Dutchmen of non-Dutch-speaking origin. Their hit song \"Oerend Hard\", a song about two bikers who lose their lives in an accident, took the charts by storm, and it is now regarded a true evergreen of Dutch music. It quickly garnered them a large fan base, even in non-Low Saxon areas, such as Fryslân and Limburg. They inspired many other young rock 'n' roll artists to sing in Low Saxon, who now form a subgenre of their own in the Dutch music industry, which is gradually becoming aware of the genres commercial potential.\n\nIn 1996, Dutch Low Saxon was added to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Dutch provinces now receive minor funds for preserving and promoting the use of Low Saxon. A general rise in regional pride and appreciation for the Low Saxon identity made the earlier openly disdainful attitude towards Low Saxon seem to have subsided somewhat. Low Saxon is increasingly being used in popular culture, marketing, and local politics.\n\nThe Tweants municipality of Rijssen-Holten, for example, has officially adopted a bilingual status for their town hall desks, and customers may opt for Dutch or Low Saxon help.\n\nIn 2012, a radio presenter for national broadcasting station 3FM, Michiel Veenstra from Almelo, promised to present in Tweants for an hour if a Tweants song received more than €10,000 in the annual fundraising campaign Het Glazen Huis (The Glass House). As the song received more than €17,000, Veenstra kept his promise.\n\nAn increasing number of local political parties have used Low Saxon in their 2014 electoral campaigns. In 2014, a Facebook page called \"Tukkers be like\" gained more than 18,000 followers within a week. The page uses Twents cultural concepts and expressions in Twents. The idea of the page was based on the US Internet meme \"Bitches be like\", which gained enormous popularity in 2013, and inspired many to create their own versions. The meme presents an image of a certain situation, to which a certain group would respond in a typical way.\n\nDutch Low Saxon has long been stigmatised and removed from schools. People of older generations may relate numerous accounts of their childhood in which contemporaries were afraid to go to school for fear of being reprimanded, or purposely ignored, for not speaking Dutch. \n\nThe similarities between the languages made Low Saxon be regarded a dialect of Dutch, and shifting from Low Saxon to Dutch would be relatively easy. Instead of adapting the school curriculum and guiding the children into learning Dutch as a second language and embracing the potential of the Low Saxon language, non-Dutch speaking parents were advised to speak Dutch with their children instead to increase their chances of success on the job market. The result was a string of Dutch dialects with Low Saxon features, which were also looked down upon.\n\nAs of 2014, Low Saxon is still not a part of the Dutch school curriculum. It is neither a subject nor a mode of communication. This causes a general lack of knowledge about, and appreciation for the language. Its possible role as a language of trade between the Netherlands and Germany is often dismissed, but recent study indicates it may be a useful addition in international trade communications.\n\nAs of 2015, language enthusiasts attempt to start up courses for the language and culture, especially in the Tweante region. They are mostly studies aimed at the elderly but still prove to be very popular. There still is no professional attempt to promote the language into the school curriculum.\n\nDutch Low Saxon has the following dialects (from north to south):\n\nMost varieties belong to the West Low Saxon group. Grunnegs is so different from the rest of the Dutch Low Saxon varieties that it may be treated separately. Tweants and Achterhooks belong to the Westphalian group of dialects.\n\nThe remainder (Drèents, Stellingwarfs, Sallaans, Urkers and Veluws) could be classified as their own subdivision, since they form the westernmost group of Low Saxon dialects, which have been considerably affected by Dutch.\n\nUrkers and West-Veluws are so heavily Hollandified that some people classify these dialects as Low Franconian, rather than Low Saxon.\n\nA lot of the dialects have been affected by the Hollandic expansion of the 17th century. All of them are lexically dependent on Dutch rather than German for neologisms. When written down, they use a Dutch-based orthography.\n\nThe plural is \"-en\" rather than \"-(e)t\", as is found in West-Veluws and Urkers and clearly from Dutch influence since a unified plural in \"-(e)t\" for verbs is common in Low Saxon. The dialects have \"wiej warken\" instead of \"wiej warkt\" for \"we work\". The feature is, surprisingly, also found in Stellingwarfs and Grunnegs. The trait is believed to have Frisian rather than Hollandic origins, however. The Stellingwerven have been West Frisian for centuries, and Groningen spoke East Frisian in the Middle Ages. Modern Frisian has \"-e\" there. \"-en\" might be a kind of intermediate form between \"-t\" and \"-e\". The unified plural takes the form \"-et\" rather than \"-t\" in the Achterhooks dialect of Winterswijk and in the more conservative southern Tweants varieties, which border the Achterhook.\n\nSeveral long vowel shifts happened in Veluws, Sallaans, Stellingwarfs and Drèents; the changed occurred as the Hollandic dialect rose in prestige during the 17th century. The \"ee\" changed to \"ie\" , the \"oo\" into \"oe\" and the \"oe\" into \"uu\" . Tweants and Eastern Achterhooks, by contrast, retained their old vowels. Compare the Tweants and Sallaans equivalents: \"deer - dier\" (\"animal\"); \"good - goed\" (\"good\"); \"hoes - huus\" (\"house\"). Surprisingly, in many dialects, the \"oe\" sound was preserved in some words but changed to \"uu\" in others. As a result, in Sallaans \"huis\" (house) is \"huus\", but \"muis\" (mouse) is \"moes\" (as in Tweants).\n\nDutch has lost the word \"doe\" \"thou\" and replaced it with \"jij\", equivalent to English \"ye\", originally the second person plural. In many Low Saxon dialects in the Netherlands, the same happened. The doe - ie/ieje/ij isogloss runs surprisingly close to the Dutch border, except in Groningen, where it enters the Dutch territory. In Twente, it is present in the easternmost villages of Denekamp and Oldenzaal, but its disappearance from the rest of the region is only a relatively recent development. In the Achterhoek (Gelderland), \"dou\" can be found in Winterswijk and Groenlo.\n\n"}

Like his older brother Chris, he was unable to play for the country of his birth because of the exclusion of the apartheid regime from international cricket, but because he had British parents he qualified to play for England. \n\nHe played for England in eleven home test series and on six overseas tours from 1988 to 1996. Smith was best known for his abilities against fast bowling, with what was regarded as a trademark square-cut that was hit ferociously. He trained to be a psychologist.\n\nIn county cricket, Smith played for Hampshire, captaining them from 1998 to 2002, before retiring from first-class cricket in 2003.\n\nUntil Kevin Pietersen (another English cricketer born in South Africa) was signed by Hampshire from Nottinghamshire in 2005, Smith was Hampshire's most successful England batsman since C. B. Fry.\n\nSmith was born in Durban, South Africa completing his High School education at Northwood School. The School honoured his career achievements by naming the 1st team cricket oval after him. In his first Test at Headingley in 1988, he shared a century partnership with fellow South African-born batsman Allan Lamb. This was one of very few century partnerships for England during the series against the firepower of the West Indies fast bowlers. The following summer, 1989, Smith was the only successful England batsman in the Ashes series making two centuries. In his second hundred at Trent Bridge, he arrived with England already three wickets down chasing 600, and played some powerful shots – particularly off Mervyn Hughes whose bowling figures were, at one point 4–0–38–0.\n\nHis highest test score, 175 against the West Indies in Antigua, was made as England replied to Brian Lara's record-breaking innings of 375. Despite his domination of fast, aggressive bowling, Smith suffered from a well-publicised vulnerability to slower bowlers – particularly the leg-spin of Shane Warne.\n\nSmith was one of England's most courageous players. He was targeted by the West Indies at Antigua in 1989–90 with fast short pitched bowling giving him no room for his favourite shots. During that innings, he was hit on the finger (subsequently diagnosed as broken) and hit flush on the jaw by a bouncer from Courtney Walsh – but neither blow forced him to retire hurt. \n\nHe scored 167 not out for England against Australia in the 1993 Texaco Trophy at Edgbaston, when Australia won by six wickets. This was the highest score made by an England batsman in an ODI (until Alex Hales scored 171 against Pakistan in 2016), and was the highest score made by any batsman who finished on the losing side in such a game (until Charles Coventry scored 194 against Bangladesh in a losing cause).\n\nDespite this, when Smith was dropped from the England team it was popularly perceived as premature, particularly given his Test batting average of over 43. Backing this up is the ICC's historical rankings of Test batsmen, which placed Smith as the 77th greatest batsman in history, and 17th greatest Englishman (ahead of others such as Geoff Boycott, Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton).\n\nIn 1994, before Smith scored 175 in the fifth and final Test against the West Indies, he was accused by the then England coach Keith Fletcher of 'having too many fingers in too many pies.'\n\nAfter retiring from county cricket at the end of the 2003 season, Smith relocated to Australia to help run helmet manufacturer Masuri. After suffering from mental health problems and anxiety, he currently works for his brother's clothing company and runs his own cricket coaching academy. Smith is also studying for a degree in psychological science at Swinburne University, Melbourne.\n"}

He was told about Sri Aurobindo and The Mother by Dilip Kumar Roy while in Paris. In 1930 he visited the Ashram and met the Mother. He then spent 2 or 3 years practising medicine in Burma, but this work failed to satisfy him. He returned to the Ashram with the intention of practising Yoga, and took up work as the resident doctor. He found to his surprise that poetry was one of the vocations taken up by some of the disciples. As Sri Aurobindo had already withdrawn from the public life of the ashram, he communicated with and instructed the sadhaks via letters, and Nirodbaran entered into a voluminous correspondence with Sri Aurobindo (receiving about 4000 letters), who encouraged and guided his attempts at poetry.

The program is hosted primarily by Ian Freeman and Mark Edge, joined frequently by rotating co-hosts. It is a chiefly libertarian anarchist political talk show, with topics ranging from current events to philosophy, and covering both politics and personal issues. \"Free Talk Live\" engages in only a very basic form of call screening.\n\nThe show is broadcast from Keene, New Hampshire. Before moving to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project, the show was broadcast from Sarasota, Florida. It airs from 7 PM to 10 PM (EST).\n\nThe program is syndicated on over 200 radio stations via the Genesis Communications Network, two television stations across the United States, on a KU-band satellite channel across North America and Africa, and on multiple Internet radio networks around the globe. The nightly shows are alternatively available on the \"Free Talk Live\" website through podcast. Archives of more than years of past shows are also available for download in MP3 format from the website.\n\nThe first broadcast was on November 3, 2002, from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM in Sarasota, Florida. \"Free Talk Live\" became a weeknight show from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. After the radio station changed format in June 2003, the show was available only on Internet radio until it was picked up by WTMY, an AM radio station in Sarasota. The show began syndication program in September 2004. \"Free Talk Live\" currently airs seven nights per week from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM Eastern time on over 120 radio and five television affiliates carrying audio simulcasts. In addition to over-the-air radio/TV, the show broadcasts on several internet radio affiliates and XM Satellite Radio channels 166 and 165, on weekdays and weekends respectively.\n\n\"Free Talk Live\" won the Podcast Awards’ Best Cultural/Political Podcast Award in 2005 and won the Best Political Podcast Award in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. The program has been featured in \"Talkers Magazine's\" 100 most important radio talk show hosts in America.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, Ian and Mark announced on air that \"Free Talk Live\" would be adding a live Sunday show to replace its rotating internet only show, with plans to syndicate the show to radio stations. The show debuted on the internet on June 19 and has since been syndicated on radio.\n\n\nThe hosts repeatedly state that \"Free Talk Live\" is \"your show\" and that \"you take control of the air waves.\" Listeners who call in will only be asked for a name, location, the topic(s) they wish to speak about, and how they listen to the show. It is stated policy that anyone who calls in will get on the air but each listener may only call the show once a day.\n\nThe hosts also purport that all women who call into the show are moved to the front of the queue. This policy was adopted to make female listenership more visible to station affiliates, and to encourage female participation overall. This is done to dismantle the myth that talk radio is for a male demographic, and also for the increased ad revenue that comes from female listeners.\n\nBetween listener phone calls, the hosts fall back to topics they are interested in as well as news events suggested by listeners.\n\nThe show does not usually feature guests but has had a number of notable guests.\n\nFunding for \"Free Talk Live\" comes from a combination of standard on-the-show advertising, and a donation-by-subscription service known as \"AMP\" (an acronym for \"Advertise, Market, and Promote\"). An AMP subscriber, or \"AMPlifier\", donates a choice from pre-established amounts of money to the show every month. Any amount can be given with a minimum of five dollars. The show has also been known to accept Bitcoin, Silver, Gold, and Liberty Dollars in lieu of Federal Reserve Notes. The hosts indicate that all funds from the AMP program go to advertising and promoting the show, as well as contributing to the cost of production. Although the hosts earn income through advertising and merchandise sales, all AMP proceeds are used to augment the listener base of the program by increasing the number of markets.\n\n, listeners contribute a total of $3,179 per month to the show via the AMP program.\n\nIan Freeman changed his last name on-air from “Bernard” to “Freeman”. On the September 17, 2008 airing of Gardner Goldsmith's New Hampshire-based talk radio show Ian asked Gardner to refer to him as “Ian Freeman” instead of “Ian Bernard”.\n\nThe hosts assert that they try to apply the ideals of freedom to their show. The hosts have stated they oppose FCC regulations but still seek to avoid FCC-prohibited speech on their broadcast as it may negatively impact the radio stations that air the show and affront some listeners or trigger the imposition of fines by the FCC against those broadcasters.) The hosts, claiming to adhere to their principles of respecting contract and voluntary agreement, state that adherence to the FCC rules come not at the demands of government agencies but the requests of/or demands by their syndicates. As of March 2009, \"Free Talk Live\" has implemented the use of a dump box.\n\nA major sponsor of \"Free Talk Live\" and a common topic of discussion is the Free State Project, an organization committed to recruiting 20,000 like minded people to move to the state of New Hampshire in search of liberty. Once there, the participants pledge to \"exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property.\" Freeman and Edge moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project in September 2006.\n\n\n"}

In this range, human hearing is not very sensitive, so sounds in this range tend to be felt more than heard. The low E-string on a bass guitar is usually tuned to 41.2 Hz. Sound reinforcement systems and PA systems often use one or more subwoofer loudspeaker cabinets that are specifically designed for amplifying sounds in the sub-bass range. Sounds below sub-bass are called infrasound.\n\n20 Hz is considered the normal low-frequency limit of human hearing. When pure sine waves are reproduced under ideal conditions and at very high decibels, a human listener will be able to identify tones as low as 12 Hz (G). Audio tracks known as bass tests use sub-bass frequencies which are used to test or to demonstrate the capabilities of audio equipment. High-end subwoofers can accurately reproduce sound to about 18 Hz ±2 dB.\n\nSub-bass energy is popular in dance music, where the low frequencies involve energy from the kick drum (bass drum), the bass guitar and electronic synthesizers and drum machines. Particular genres such as house music, drum and bass and dubstep often feature a bassline that consists mainly of sub-bass frequencies. Much experimental music uses sub-bass, in particular drone music, where the majority of the sound can often be in the sub-bass range. Often, hip hop and rap songs feature prevalent sub-bass. The pedal keyboard range on pipe organs also often extends into the sub-bass range; the bottom note of a 16′ stop is typically tuned to 32 Hz (C), a 32′ stop at 16 Hz (C).\n"}
{"id": "1999950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999950", "title": "Filip Lundberg", "text": "Filip Lundberg\n\nErnst Filip Oskar Lundberg (2 June 1876 – 31 December 1965) Swedish actuary, and mathematician. Lundberg is one of the founders of mathematical risk theory and worked as managing director of several insurance companies.\n\nAccording to Harald Cramér, \"Filip Lundberg's works on risk theory were all written at a time when no general theory of stochastic processes existed, and when collective reinsurance methods, in the present sense of the word, were entirely unknown to insurance companies. In both respects his ideas were far ahead of their time, and his works deserve to be generally recognized as pioneering works of fundamental importance.\"\n\nBorn in 1876, Filip Lundberg's father, Philip Lundberg, was a school teacher in mathematics who died just three months after Lundberg was born. Filip's first ambition was to follow his father's career in mathematics. He studied mathematics at the University of Uppsala, graduating in 1896 and receiving his Licentiate in 1898. However, instead of becoming a teacher, Filip joined a newly founded insurance company. In 1903, Lundberg went on to defend his doctoral thesis on the probability and collective risk. He soon moved to a second company where he was appointed actuary and, at the age of 28, became its managing director. From 1904 to the 1930s, Lundberg's activities were divided between his everyday life and trying to understand the relationship between the concepts 'collective' and 'risk'. Lundberg's results are described in his academic publications between the years 1909 and 1930. His major works on the ruin problem were published in 1926 and 1928. From 1910 on, he was a leading voice in debates about the life insurance industry and a prolific writer and debater. Lundberg advocated a cautious approach to the insurance business which emphasized consolidation before expansion. Lundberg went on to become a leader of the industry, managing other companies, serving as chairman of the Association of Swedish Life Insurance Companies for ten years, and sitting on government committees on insurance. Filip Lundberg left his last position within Swedish insurance, as chairman of the board of Eir, in the same year that his collective risk theory was definitively clarified. Filip Lundberg died in 1965.\n\nIn parallel to his business career, Lundberg worked on a theory of collective risk. In 1903, he finished his doctoral thesis, \"Approximations of the Probability Function/Reinsurance of Collective Risks.\" This introduced the compound Poisson process and involved work on the central limit theorem. Cramér writes that the thesis has a reputation for being impossible to understand but, that looked at now, \"one cannot help being struck by his ability to deal intuitively with concepts and methods that would have to wait another thirty years before being put on a rigorous foundation.\" Cramér mentions later work by Andrey Kolmogorov and William Feller but it was Cramér himself who developed Lundberg's ideas on risk and linked them to the emerging theory of stochastic processes.\n\nFocardi & Fabozzi describes Lundberg's thesis as a milestone in actuarial mathematics. It was the first to define a collective theory of risk and to apply a sophisticated probabilistic formulation to the insurance ruin problem. Lundberg’s work anticipated many future developments of probability theory, including what was later to be known as the theory of point processes. Lundberg's theory, together with that of French mathematician Louis Bachelier, was ahead of its time and inspired the subsequent development of probability theory. But the type of mathematics implied by his work could not be employed completely until the development of digital computers.\n\nBecause he published many of his major works in Swedish, Lundberg's work went unnoticed by the actuarial community for nearly 30 years. However, eventually Lundberg's ideas became known largely through the work of Cramér and his students. Although Lundberg published some work in German, the international scientific language of the time, Lundberg's thesis and most of his subsequent writings were in Swedish. His mathematical language did not travel easily, either.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1999955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999955", "title": "Academy (English school)", "text": "Academy (English school)\n\nAcademy schools are state-funded schools in England which are directly funded by the Department for Education and independent of local authority control. The terms of the arrangements are set out in individual Academy Funding Agreements.\nMost academies are secondary schools (and most secondary schools are academies). However, slightly more than 25% of primary schools (4,363 as of December 2017), as well as some of the remaining first, middle and secondary schools, are also academies.\n\nAcademies are self-governing non-profit charitable trusts and may receive additional support from personal or corporate sponsors, either financially or in kind. They do not have to follow the National Curriculum, but do have to ensure that their curriculum is broad and balanced, and that it includes the core subjects of mathematics and English. They are subject to inspection by Ofsted.\n\nThe following are all types of academy:\n\nAn academy trust that operates more than one academy is known as a multi-academy trust, although sometimes the terms academy group or academy federation are used instead. An academy chain is a group of trusts working together under a shared management structure.\n\nAn academy is governed by the Academy Agreement it makes with the Department for Education, and at that point it severs connections with the local education authority. The current advisory text is the \"Academy and free school: master funding agreement\" dated March 2018. The governors of the academy are obliged to publish an annual report and accounts, that are open to scrutiny.\n\nAll academies are expected to follow a broad and balanced curriculum but many have a particular focus on, or formal specialism in, one or more areas such as science; arts; business and enterprise; computing; engineering; mathematics; modern foreign languages; performing arts; sport; or technology. Although academies are required to follow the National Curriculum in the core subjects of maths, English and science, they are otherwise free to innovate; however, as they participate in the same Key Stage 3 and GCSE exams as other English schools, they teach a curriculum very similar to maintained schools, with only small variations.\n\nLike other state-funded schools, academies are required to adhere to the National Admissions Code, although newly established academies with a faith designation are subject to the 50% Rule requiring them to allocate at least half of their places without reference to faith.\n\nIn terms of their governance, academies are established as companies limited by guarantee with a Board of Directors that acts as a Trust. The Academy Trust has exempt charity status, regulated by the Department for Education. The trustees are legally, but not financially, accountable for the operation of the academy. The Trust serves as the legal entity of which the school is part. The trustees oversee the running of the school, sometimes delegating responsibility to a local governing body which they appoint. The day-to-day management of the school is, as in most schools, conducted by the Head Teacher and their senior management team.\n\nIn Sponsored Academies, the sponsor is able to influence the process of establishing the school, including its curriculum, ethos, specialism and building (if a new one is built). The sponsor also has the power to appoint governors to the academy's governing body.\n\nThe Labour Government under Tony Blair established academies through the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which amended the section of the Education Act 1996 relating to City Technology Colleges. They were first announced in a speech by David Blunkett, then Secretary of State for Education and Skills, in 2000. He said that their aim was \"to improve pupil performance and break the cycle of low expectations.\" As of 2018 many academies are struggling financially and running deficits.\n\nThe chief architect of the policy was Andrew Adonis (now Lord Adonis, formerly Secretary of State at the Department for Transport) in his capacity as education advisor to the Prime Minister in the late 1990s.\n\nAcademies were known as City Academies for the first few years, but the term was changed to Academies by an amendment in the Education Act 2002. The term Sponsored Academies was applied retrospectively to this type of academy, to distinguish it from other types of academy that were enabled later.\n\nSponsored Academies originally needed a \"private\" sponsor who could be an individual (such as Sir David Garrard, who sponsors Business Academy Bexley), organisations such as the United Learning Trust, mission-driven businesses such as The Co-operative Group or outsourcing for-profit businesses such as Amey plc). These sponsors were expected to bring \"the best of private-sector best practice and innovative management\" to academies, \"often in marked contrast to the lack of leadership experienced by the failing schools that academies have replaced\" (known as predecessor schools). They were originally required to contribute 10% of the academy's capital costs (up to a maximum of £2m). The remainder of the capital and running costs were met by the state in the usual way for UK state schools through grants funded by the local authority.\n\nThe Government later removed the requirement for financial investment by a private sponsor in a move to encourage successful existing schools and charities to become sponsors.\n\nSponsored Academies typically replaced one or more existing schools, but some were newly established. They were intended to address the problem of entrenched failure within English schools with low academic achievement, or schools situated in communities with low academic aspirations. Often these schools had been placed in \"special measures\" after an Ofsted inspection, as has been the case for schools in the Co-op Academies Trust (one of the larger business-supported trusts). They were expected to be creative and innovative because of their financial and academic freedoms, in order to deal with the long-term issues they were intended to solve.\n\nOriginally all Sponsored Academies had to have a curriculum specialism within the English Specialist Schools Programme (SSP). However, this requirement was removed in 2010.\n\nBy May 2010 there were 203 Sponsored Academies in England.\n\nThe Academies Act 2010 sought to increase the number of academies. It enabled all maintained schools to convert to academy status, known as Converter Academies and enabled new academies to be created via the Free School Programme.\n\nAt the same time the new Conservative-led Coalition Government announced that they would redirect funding for school Specialisms [i.e. Technology College Status] into mainstream funding. This meant that Secondary Schools would no longer directly receive ring-fenced funds of c£130K from Government for each of their specialisms. One way to regain some direct control over their finances was to become a Converter Academy and receive all of their funding direct from Government, with the possibility of buying in services at a cheaper rate. This, along with some schools wanting more independence from local authority control, meant that many state secondary schools in England converted to academy status in subsequent years.\n\nBy April 2011, the number of academies had increased to 629, and by August 2011, reached 1,070. By July 2012 this number reached 1,957, double that of the previous year. and, at 1 November 2013, it stood at 3,444.\n\nThere are no academies in Wales or Scotland, where education policy is devolved.\n\nThe Education Funding Agency monitors financial management and governance of academies. In March 2016 the Perry Beeches The Academy Trust, a multi-academy trust, was found to have deleted financial records for £2.5 million of free school meal funding, and that the chief executive was being paid by sub-contractors as well as by the trust. Its schools are likely to be taken over by a new trust. In August 2016, the former principal and founder of Kings Science Academy, the former finance director, and a former teacher who was the founder's sister were found guilty of defrauding public funds of £150,000.\n\nIn October 2017, the Wakefield City Academies Trust collapsed, and \"The Observer\" reported that \"Wakefield City Academies Trust now stands accused of 'asset stripping” after it transferred millions of pounds of the schools’ savings to its own accounts before collapsing. On 8 September it released a statement announcing it would divest itself of its 21 schools as it could not undertake the ´rapid improvement our academies need' \".\n\nWhilst still in the fairly early stage of development, supporters pointed to emerging data showing \"striking\" improvements in GCSE results for academies compared to their predecessors, with early results showing that \"GCSE results are improving twice as fast in academies as in state schools\".\n\nIn an article in \"The Observer\", that regarded many of the Government's claims for academies with scepticism, journalist Geraldine Bedell conceded that:\n\nThe article singles out the cited academy, Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, as \"apparently the most popular [school] in Britain – at least with politicians\" and \"the top school in the country for value-added results\".\n\nAcademies have continued to be controversial, and their existence has frequently been opposed and challenged by some politicians, commentators, teachers, teachers' unions, and parents. Even after several years of operation and with a number of academies open and reporting successes, the programme continues to come under attack for creating schools that are said to be, among other things, a waste of money, selective, damaging to the schools and communities around them, forced on parents who do not want them, and a move towards privatisation of education \"by the back door\".\n\nThe introduction of academy schools was opposed, notably by teachers' trade unions and some high-profile members within the Labour Party, such as former party leader Lord Kinnock. Neil Kinnock criticised the academies scheme saying that they were a \"distortion of choice\" and risked creating a \"seller's market\" with \"schools selecting parents and children instead of parents selecting schools\".\n\nThe House of Commons Education and Skills Select Committee reported in March 2005 that it would have been wiser to limit the programme to 30 or 50 academies in order to evaluate the results before expanding the programme, and that \"the rapid expansion of the Academy policy comes at the expense of rigorous evaluation\". The Select Committee was concerned that the promising results achieved by some academies may be due to increased exclusions of harder-to-teach pupils. They noted that two Middlesbrough academies had expelled 61 pupils, compared to just 15 from all other secondary schools in the borough.\n\nThe programme of creating academies has also been heavily criticised by some for handing schools to private sector entrepreneurs who in many cases have no experience of the education sector: such as the Evangelical Christian car dealer, Sir Peter Vardy, who has been accused of promoting the teaching of creationism alongside macroevolution in his Emmanuel Schools Foundation academies. This is also linked to the wider debate in the education sector as to the benefits or otherwise of the growing role of religion in the school system being promoted by the New Labour government in general, and Tony Blair in particular, with many academies (one estimate puts it at \"more than half\") being sponsored either by religious groups or organisations/individuals with a religious affiliation.\n\nThere are indications that several city academies are failing. Ofsted has placed the Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough and the Richard Rose Central Academy in Carlisle under special measures, heavily criticised the West London Academy in Ealing and condemned standards at the Business Academy in Bexley, South London.\n\nThe Richard Rose Central Academy in Carlisle, sponsored by Eddie Stobart owner Andrew Tinkler, and local businessman Brian Scowcroft opened in September 2008. By January 2009, there were protests by parents and pupils regarding poor quality education and school facilities. The school was found to be failing and was placed in special measures, with the headmaster and chief executive being immediately replaced.\n\nA parliamentary report in 2015, entitled \"Free Schools and Academies\", recommends that \"In the meantime the Government should stop exaggerating the success of academies and be cautious about firm conclusions except where the evidence merits it. Academisation is not always successful nor is it the only proven alternative for a struggling school\". In 2016 a major study by the Education Policy Institute found no significant differences in performance between Academies and local council run schools, and that multi-academy trusts running at least five schools performed worse than local council run schools.\n\nThe original City Academy programme was attacked for its expense: it cost on average £25m to build an academy under this scheme, much of which was taken up by the costs of new buildings. Critics contend that this is significantly more than it costs to build a new local authority school. Some operators are paying senior staff six-figure salaries, partly funded by central government.\n\nIn 2012, the academy scheme was applied to primary schools. The government began transforming some schools that had been graded Satisfactory or lower by Ofsted into academies, in some cases removing existing governing bodies and Head Teachers. An example was Downhills Primary School in Haringey, where the Head resisted turning the school into an academy. Ofsted were called in to assess the school, and placed it in Special Measures. The head and the Governing Body were removed and replaced with a Government-appointed board. There was opposition from the school and parents.\n\nIn December 2012, the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons questioned Henry Stewart, of the Local Schools Network, and Rachel Wolf, of the New Schools Network, on accountability and funding of academies and free schools. The Committee was review a report by the Auditor General, \"Managing the Expansion of the Academies Programme\" (HC 682), which had identified that in 2011-12 £96,000,000 had been diverted from supporting under-performing Local Authority schools to the academies programme, followed by a further £400,000,000 in the financial year 2012-13. The Committee also questioned Chris Wormald, then Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education, who admitted that the Government had deliberately chosen to remove money originally allocated to support under performing schools. Chris Wormald stated, \"The Government took a very conscious decision that its major school improvement programme was the academies programme.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party has supported the academy proposal from its inception but wants the scheme to go further. This accord was reflected in a remark made by Conservative spokesman David Willetts in 2006:\n\nIn 2004, the Liberal Democrats were reported as being \"split\" on the issue and so decided that academies should not be mentioned in the party's education policy. The position of Phil Willis, the education spokesman at the time, was summarised as:\n\nIn 2005, Willis' successor, Ed Davey, argued that academies were creating a \"two-tier education system\" and called for the academy programme to be halted until \"a proper analysis can be done\". At the subsequent election, Academies were supported by all three main political parties, with a further cross-party initiative to extend the programme into primary schools currently being considered.\n\nIn 2010 the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition government announced plans to expand the academy programme with the Academies Act 2010. In May 2010 the then Education secretary Michael Gove wrote to all state schools in England inviting them to opt out of Local Authority control and convert to Academy status. Gove also stated that some academies could be created in time for the new Academic year in September 2010. By 23 July 2010, 153 schools in England had applied for academy status, lower than the prediction that more than 1,000 would do so. In spite of the expanding Academy programme, in August 2010 Gove announced that 75 existing academy rebuild projects were likely to be scaled back. Nevertheless, by September 2012, the majority of state secondary schools in England had become Academies. Monthly updated information on existing academies and free schools, and applications in process, is published by the Department for Education.\n\nThe city academy programme was originally based on the programme of City Technology Colleges (CTCs) created by the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, which were also business-sponsored.\n\nFrom 2003, the Government encouraged CTCs to convert to academies; did so (for example, Djanogly CTC is now Djanogly City Academy) was a 2003 conversion.\n\nAcademies differ from CTCs in several ways; most notably, academies cannot select more than 10% of pupils by ability , whereas CTCs can.\n\nAcademies have been compared to US charter schools, which are publicly funded schools largely independent of state and federal control.\n\nA number of private and charitable organisations run groups of academies, known as Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs). These major operators include ARK Schools, Academies Enterprise Trust, E-ACT (formerly Edutrust Academies Charitable Trust), Emmanuel Schools Foundation, Harris Federation, Oasis Trust, Ormiston Academies Trust, Tauheedul Education Trust and United Learning Trust.\n\nThe Department for Education publishes a full list of active academy sponsors.\n\nIn September 2017, the Wakefield City Academies Trust announced it was ceasing operation and preparing to dissolve as it did not have the capacity to manage its 21 schools, and asked the government to make an alternative arrangement.\n\nIn January 2018, a league table was produced to \"name and shame\" the worst performers using the Progress 8 benchmark, which measures GCSE results after compensating for each pupil's performance at the end of Key Stage 2.\n\nMATs fail in staff remuneration, being exempt from all Teacher Pay and Conditions agreements. In March 2018, the Guardian revealed that they fail in gender equality.\n\nIn December 2018, the Sutton Trust published a report on the effectiveness of MATs in improving the performance of disadvantaged children, with its authors noting that \"Our five-year analysis of sponsor academies’ provision for disadvantaged pupils shows that while a few chains are demonstrating transformational results for these pupils, more are struggling.\"\n\nIn 2019 there were 5,539 primary academies in England, of which 514 were forced away from local authority control after being failed by Ofsted. The Department for Education (DfE) paid out at least £18.4m to the academy trusts taking on these schools. The parents, governors and local authorities had no say in how this money was spent or how the assets were used.\n\nSince 2013–14, more than 300 primary academies have been rebrokered (receiving government setup money again) or moved between trusts. In 2017–8, seven trusts running primary schools closed leaving all their schools in search of another sponsor. This leads to uncertainly and expense as the new trust will rebrand and parents must pay for new school uniform. New rules, staff and systems are set in place. \n\nAn example of a failed academy is Copperfields Academy in Northfleet, Gravesend, Kent. The Reach2 Trust, which has 58 schools, took over the failing school against the wishes of school, governors or parents in 2013. They were given a start-up grant, and failed to attract qualified teachers, and their management was described as turbulent when Ofsted inspected them in January 2019. A “minded to terminate” notice was given to the trust, saying that the school would be re-brokered to another sponsor if any other Reach2 school failed. They had already had problems in 2018 with the Sprites Primary Academy in Ipswich. \nA follow-up inspection in June declared that the school was now on course: that \"effective action\" was being taken, and that both the trust's statement of action and improvement plan were fit for purpose. This is in spite of the school being short of 9 teachers out of the 18 needed, having 2 temporary deputies, and a head teacher seconded from another school.\n\n\n"}

He was then the first Governor of Tasmania, from 1855 until 1861.\n\nYoung was the third son of Sir Aretas William Young, a well-known peninsular officer, and was born at Brabourne, Kent. He was educated at Dean's School, Bromley, Middlesex, and, intended for the bar, entered as a student at the Inner Temple.\n\nYoung was appointed in 1827 to a position in the colonial treasury in Trinidad, and in 1828 was transferred to Demerara, British Guiana. From 1833, he was involved in the emancipation of slaves in the British Caribbean colonies. In 1834, he was posted briefly to St Lucia as treasurer, secretary and member of the council, and in 1835 returned to British Guiana as government secretary.\n\nIn 1847, Young returned to London, before he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Eastern District of the Cape Colony (later the Eastern Cape) in South Africa. He was knighted in 1847.\n\nYoung was transferred a few months later to South Australia where he arrived on 1 August 1848 on the \"Forfarshire\". It was hoped that he would be able to announce some measure of responsible government but he had nothing to say on this subject, and it was not until February 1851 that an ordinance was passed constituting a Legislative council of 24 members, of whom eight were nominated by the crown (four officials and four appointed by the governor) and 16 were to be elected. Under Young, South Australia received its first formal parliament.\n\nThe South Australian House of Assembly comprised 36 members each elected from a different area. It was Governor Young who offered a prize of £2000 in 1851 for the first person to travel up the Murray River to its junction with the Darling River (now the town of Wentworth) in a paddle steamer. The prize was claimed in 1853 by Francis Cadell with his steamer \"Lady Augusta\" (named for Sir Henry's wife). Due to the difficulty of navigating the Murray Mouth, Young supported building the railway from the river port of Goolwa to the new sea port at Port Elliot (named after his friend, Charles Elliot). Young was president of the Adelaide Philosophical Society 1853–1854.\nThough it was expected sooner or later, the order for his transfer to Van Diemen's Land (today's Tasmania) gave little time for the usual formalities and farewells.\n\nYoung began his duties in Van Diemens Land in January 1855. Sir Henry Fox Young's term as Governor of Van Diemens Land was significant, because in 1856 the Island colony received self-government, and was renamed Tasmania to mark the fact and as a deliberate measure by free-settlers to distance its convict past. Sir Henry was the first Tasmanian Governor to occupy Government House, Hobart, the beautiful neo-gothic Vice-Regal residence on the banks of the River Derwent.\n\nAt this time the constitution act was awaiting the royal assent, and the legislative council might wisely have postponed meeting until news of this had been received. It, however, met in July and one of its acts was to form a committee to inquire into the working of the convict department. Dr Hampton, the comptroller-general of convicts, was summoned to appear as a witness and refused to attend. The council decided he was guilty of contempt and arrested him. Hampton served a writ of habeas corpus upon the sergeant-at-arms and the opinion of the law officers of the crown was against the legality of the council's proceedings. Young then attended at the house and prorogued the council until 20 October. \"The Times\" severely commented upon Young's conduct, but he was commended by the British government. The Tasmanian supreme court ruled against the council, and when it was taken to the privy council this decision was confirmed. The new constitution was soon successfully instituted and Young welcomed the change in his position, feeling that he was now above the battle and freed from much trying responsibility. He travelled through the island, showed much interest in its development, and capably carried out the work of his office.\n\nYoung left Tasmania on 10 December 1861 for Melbourne, whence he travelled to England and lived in retirement in London until his death there on 18 September 1870. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.\n\nYoungtown, Tasmania, was named in honour of Young.\n\nYoung married Augusta Sophia Marryat (born 1829) in 1848. She was the daughter of a former slaveholder, Charles Marryat, of Potter's Bar, Middlesex, who had been compensated part of £34,000 in the 1830s upon the emancipation of slavery. Augusta (later Lady Young) was the niece of the novelist Captain Frederick Marryat, and sister of Charles Marryat, Dean of Adelaide (1887–1906). Her mother was Caroline Short, whose brother, Augustus Short, was the first Anglican bishop of Adelaide.\n\nThe couple had four children, two boys and two girls.\n\nThe town of Port Augusta in South Australia is named after Augusta, as is the tiny suburb of Marryatville in Adelaide's eastern suburbs.\n\nAugusta outlived her husband by 43 years, dying in Christchurch, Hampshire in 1913.\n"}

In the 1970s, his high school rock band was called Your Mother. He also played in several jazz cover bands. In 1978 he was a percussion major at San Jose State University.\n\nBlack moved to Los Angeles in May 1980 still using his given name Paul Martin Marmorstein. His first L.A. band was Mad Captions who played CBGB in New York and The Hot Club in Philadelphia with The Dead Boys. In 1981 Paul joined The Mau-Mau's, a Los Angeles-based punk band which was fronted by Rick Wilder of The Berlin Brats. During Paul's time with The Mau-Mau's he shortened his name to Paul Mars. Paul played drums for a Mau-Mau's record produced by Robbie Krieger of The Doors which was never released. In 1984 Paul Mars Joined The Joneses and recorded the drums for \"Keeping Up With The Joneses\".\n\nBlack began putting together a side project for his songs to be called Faster Pussycat with guitarist Mick Cripps. Black switched to lead vocals, Cripps switched to bass, and the two joined guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Nickey \"Beat\" Alexander and later on guitarist Robert Stoddard to complete this line up.\n\nThe name was switched to L.A. Guns because the owner of the name, Raz Cue, offered to back the band if this line up would re-use L.A. Guns, a name which had been abandoned over a year prior by a former band of Guns's (Guns N' Roses). Black changed his name again to Paul Black. From 1985 to March 1987 Paul Black wrote and co-wrote a number of songs, which led L.A. Guns to a record deal with Polygram Records. However, Black left before the record was finished and before the deal was signed. Black was replaced by Phil Lewis.\n\nAfter leaving L.A. Guns, Black formed Black Cherry, which quickly became one of the most popular and sought after bands in L.A. But, a lawsuit filed by Black against his former band L.A. Guns and Polygram Records kept Black Cherry from signing a deal. Black retired in 1993 and seldom played shows. In 2000 Black wrote and recorded an album with Jo Almeida of Dogs D'Amour called \"Jo & Paul's Sonic Boom, Sun Down And Yellow Moon\".\n\nTwo compilation albums of featuring unreleased archive material of Black singing with L.A.

{"id": "2000000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000000", "title": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate", "text": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate\n\nDimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH)SCHCHCOO. This zwitterionic metabolite can be found in marine phytoplankton, seaweeds, and some species of terrestrial and aquatic vascular plants. It functions as an osmolyte as well as several other physiological and environmental roles have also been identified. DMSP was first identified in the marine red alga \"Polysiphonia fastigiata\".\n\nIn higher plants, DMSP is biosynthesized from \"S\"-methylmethionine. Two intermediates in this conversion are dimethylsulfoniumpropylamine and dimethylsulfoniumpropionaldehyde. In algae, however, the biosynthesis starts with the removal of the amino group from methionine, rather than from \"S\"-methylmethionine.\n\nDMSP is broken down by marine microbes to form two major volatile sulfur products, each with distinct effects on the environment. One of its breakdown products is methanethiol (CHSH), which is assimilated by bacteria into protein sulfur. Another volatile breakdown product is dimethyl sulfide (CHSCH; DMS). There is evidence that DMS in seawater can be produced by cleavage of dissolved (extracellular) DMSP by the enzyme DMSP-lyase, although many non-marine species of bacteria convert methanethiol to DMS.\n\nDMS is also taken up by marine bacteria, but not as rapidly as methanethiol. Although DMS usually consists of less than 25% of the volatile breakdown products of DMSP, the high reactivity of methanethiol makes the steady-state DMS concentrations in seawater approximately 10 times those of methanethiol (~3 nM vs. ~0.3 nM). Curiously, there have never been any published correlations between the concentrations of DMS and methanethiol. This is probably due to the non-linear abiotic and microbial uptake of methanethiol in seawater, and the comparatively low reactivity of DMS. However, a significant portion of DMS in seawater is oxidized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n\nRelevant to global climate, DMS is thought to play a role in the Earth's heat budget by decreasing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. This occurs through degradation of DMS in the atmosphere into hygroscopic compounds that condense water vapor leading to the formation of clouds.\n\nDMSP has also been implicated in influencing the taste and odour characteristics of various products. For example, although DMSP is odourless and tasteless, it is accumulated at high levels in some marine herbivores or filter feeders. Increased growth rates, vigour and stress resistance among animals cultivated on such diets have been reported. DMS, is responsible for repellent, 'off' tastes and odours that develop in some seafood products because of the action of bacterial DMSP-lyase, which cogenerates acrylate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000002", "title": "Stefano Bontade", "text": "Stefano Bontade\n\nStefano Bontade (23 April 1939 – 23 April 1981) was a powerful member of the Sicilian Mafia. He was commonly called \"Bontade\" but the actual surname is Bontate. He was the boss of the Santa Maria di Gesù Family in Palermo. He was also known as the \"Principe di Villagrazia\" (Prince of Villagrazia) − the area of Palermo he controlled − and \"Il Falco\" (the Falcon). He had links with several powerful politicians in Sicily with links to former prime minister Giulio Andreotti. In 1981 he was killed by the rival faction within Cosa Nostra, the Corleonesi. His death sparked a brutal Mafia War that left several hundred mafiosi dead.\n\nBontade was born in Palermo into a family of Mafiosi. His father and grandfather were both powerful Mafia bosses in the area Villagrazia, Santa Maria di Gesù and Guadagna, which were rural districts before they were absorbed into the city of Palermo in the 1960s. Stefano's father, Francesco Paolo Bontade, was one of the most powerful mafiosi on the island and a pallbearer at the funeral of Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini – one of the most influential Mafia bosses of Sicily after World War II until his death in 1954.\n\nStefano Bontade and his brother Giovanni Bontade, who would become a lawyer, studied at a Jesuit college. In 1964, at the age of 25, Stefano Bontade became the boss of the Santa Maria di Gesù Mafia Family when his father, \"Don Paolino\" Bontade, stepped down because of ill-health (he suffered from diabetes). The Mafia went through difficult times at that moment. A bloody internal struggle (known as the First Mafia War) culminated in the Ciaculli Massacre in June 1963 that killed seven police and military officers sent to defuse a bomb in an abandoned Alfa Romeo Giulietta after an anonymous phone call.\nThe Ciaculli Massacre changed the Mafia war into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. Within a period of ten weeks 1,200 mafiosi were arrested, many of whom would be kept out of circulation for five or six years. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved and those mafiosi who had escaped arrest went into exile abroad or had to hide out in Italy. In 1968, 114 went to trial, though only ten minor figures would be convicted of anything. Bontade nonetheless managed to remain a highly important figure within Cosa Nostra, and he was also one of those responsible for ordering the death of Michele Cavataio by sending two of his soldiers, Gaetano Grado and Emanuele D'Agostino, to kill him in the Viale Lazio massacre.\n\nAfter the killing of Pietro Scaglione – Chief Prosecutor of Palermo – on May 5, 1971, the police rounded up the known Mafia bosses. Bontade was arrested in 1972 and he was sentenced to three years in the second Trial of the 114 in July 1974, but the sentence was annulled in appeal. Nevertheless, Bontade was sent in banishment to Qualiano (in the province of Naples). The policy of banishing mafiosi to other areas in Italy backfired, because they were able to establish contacts outside the island as well. Bontade, for instance, linked up with Giuseppe Sciorio of the Maisto-clan of the Camorra, who would be initiated in Cosa Nostra.\n\nBontade and other banished mafiosi managed to get into the market of international cigarette smuggling by imposing first their protection, and later their involvement, upon the smugglers in Naples (who were connected with the Camorra) and Palermo who had been running this activity since the 1950s. For instance, a thriving smuggler such as Nunzio La Mattina, was initiated into the Santa Maria di Gesù Family.\n\nIt was only through cigarette smuggling and subsequently heroin trafficking that many mafiosi were able to survive the difficult period after the Ciaculli Massacre. But then they started to accumulate large amounts of money rapidly. According to pentito Antonio Calderone, Bontade used to say that fortunately Tommaso Spadaro did a little bit of cigarette smuggling and gave him part of the profits, \"because they were starving to death.\" (Spadaro was related to Bontade, being a godfather to one of his children.)\n\nBontade was closely linked to the Spatola-Inzerillo-Gambino network. This network and other Sicilian suppliers dominated heroin trafficking since the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when US and Italian law enforcement were able to significantly reduce the heroin supply of the Sicilian Mafia (the so-called Pizza Connection). The Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo traffickers supplied the Gambino Family – through John Gambino – in New York with heroin that was refined in laboratories on the island from Turkish morphine base. According to Giovanni Falcone, the investigating magistrate, the group had made about US$600 million. The proceeds were re-invested in real estate. Rosario Spatola, who in his youth peddled watered milk in the streets of Palermo, became Palermo's largest building contractor and biggest taxpayer of Sicily.\n\nThe pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia, who belonged to the Santa Maria di Gesù Family and who was highly sought after by all Mafia families for his skills in chemistry, recalled having refined at least 1000 kilograms of heroin for Bontade. Marino Mannoia, who had been close to Bontade, decided to cooperate with the Italian state in October 1989, after his brother was killed by the Corleonesi (and subsequently saw his mother, his sister and his aunt killed as well). According to Marino Mannoia the Sicilian-born banker Michele Sindona laundered the proceeds of heroin trafficking for the Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo-Gambino network.\n\nIn May 1994 Mafia turncoat Buscetta declared that Bontade had been involved in the murder of Enrico Mattei, the president of Italy's state-owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI. Mattei was killed in 1962 at the request of the American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies. Buscetta claimed that the killing was organized by Bontade, Salvatore Greco \"Ciaschiteddu\", and Giuseppe Di Cristina on the request of Angelo Bruno, a Sicilian born Mafia boss from Philadelphia.\n\nBuscetta also claimed that the journalist Mauro De Mauro was killed in September 1970 on the orders of Bontade because of his investigations into the death of Mattei. Buscetta said that Bontade organized the kidnap, because De Mauro's investigations into the death of Mattei came very close to the Mafia, and Bontade's own role in the affair. Other pentiti said that De Mauro was kidnapped by Emanuele D'Agostino, a mafioso from Bontade's Santa Maria di Gesù Family. De Mauro's body has never been found. Marino Mannoia testified that he had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies, including De Mauro's, and dissolve them in acid.\n\nMichele Sindona was in charge of one of the biggest banks in the United States, the Franklin National Bank, controlled the Vatican foreign investments and was a major sponsor of the Christian Democrat party (DC – Democrazia Cristiana), according to a 1982 parliamentary inquiry. The inquiry also pointed out Sindona's relationship with Giulio Andreotti – who served as the prime minister of Italy seven times – and who once defined Sindona as the 'rescuer of the lira'.\n\nAfter Sindona's banks went bankrupt in 1974, Sindona fled to the US. In July 1979, Sindona ordered the murder of Giorgio Ambrosoli, a lawyer appointed to liquidate his failed Banca Privata Italiana. At the same time the Mafia killed police superintendent Boris Giuliano who was investigating the Mafia's heroin trafficking and had contacted Ambrosoli just two weeks before to compare investigations.\nWhile under indictment in the US, Sindona staged a bogus kidnapping in August 1979 to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial. Bontade's brother in law Giacomo Vitale (a freemason, like Bontade) was one of the persons who organised Sindona's travel. The real purpose of the kidnapping was to issue sparsely disguised blackmail notes to Sindona's past political allies – among them Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recuperate Cosa Nostra's money. The plot failed and after his “release” Sindona surrendered to the FBI.\nThe Sindona-affair showed the close links between the Mafia and certain important business men, freemasons and politicians. In the aftermath of the investigations it appeared that many of them were connected through the secret P2 lodge (Propaganda Due) of Licio Gelli.\n\nStefano Bontade had links with the Christian Democrat politician Salvo Lima (DC – Democrazia Cristiana) and Antonio Salvo and Ignazio Salvo, two wealthy mafia-cousins from Salemi who acted as the tax collectors on the island (tax collection was contracted out by the government). Through them Bontade had access to Giulio Andreotti. Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in October 2004 that Andreotti had \"friendly and even direct ties\" with top men in the so-called moderate wing of Cosa Nostra, Stefano Bontade and Gaetano Badalamenti, favoured by the connection between them and Salvo Lima.\n\nAccording to pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia, Andreotti contacted Bontade to try to prevent the Mafia from killing DC-politician Piersanti Mattarella. Mattarella became the President of the autonomous Sicilian Region in 1978 and wanted to clean up the government's public contracts racket that benefitted Cosa Nostra. Bontade and other mafiosi felt betrayed by Mattarella (his father Bernardo Mattarella was rumored to be associated with the Mafia, but all accusations against him were not proven before any court of law).\n\nAndreotti's attempt failed. After the murder of Mattarella on 6 January 1980, Andreotti again contacted Bontade to try to straighten things out. However, according to Marino Mannoia, Bontade told Andreotti: \"we are in charge in Sicily, and unless you want the whole DC canceled out, you do as we say.\"\n\nStefano Bontade was also in touch with Silvio Berlusconi in the mid-1970s, when Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire (Berlusconi became prime minister in 1994, 2001–2006, and again from 2008 to 2012). Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore on the outskirts of Milan, according to Antonino Giuffrè, a mafioso who was a key aide to Mafia kingpin Bernardo Provenzano but turned state witness after his arrest in April 2002. Bontade's contact at Arcore was the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted mafioso who used to be a stable manager there. \"When Vittorio Mangano got the job in the Arcore villa, Stefano Bontade and some of his close aides used to meet Berlusconi using visits to Mangano as an excuse,\" Giuffrè said. Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as \"false\" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party.\n\nIn 1970, the Sicilian Mafia Commission was revived. It consisted of ten members but would initially be ruled by a triumvirate consisting of Gaetano Badalamenti, Stefano Bontade and the Corleonesi boss Luciano Leggio, although it was Salvatore Riina who actually would represent the Corleonesi. At the time Bontade was emerging as one of the Sicilian Mafia's acknowledged leaders. Young, rich, personable, intelligent and judicious, as well as the son of a renowned Mafia boss, it all made Bontade an undisputed candidate to sit on the Sicilian Mafia Commission. In 1975 the full Commission was reconstituted under the leadership of Badalamenti.\n\nThe Mafia Commission was meant to settle disputes and keep the peace, but Leggio and his stand-in and successor, Salvatore Riina, were plotting to decimate the Palermo clans, including Bontade and Bontade's ally, Salvatore Inzerillo. At the close of 1978, the leadership of the Sicilian Mafia changed. Gaetano Badalamenti, was expelled from the Commission and Michele Greco replaced him. This marked the end of a period of relative peace and signified a major change in the Mafia itself. Greco was actually allied with Salvatore Riina, and he subsequently used his position to lure many more of Bontade's friends to their deaths in the subsequent Mafia War. Historically, the Greco clan was at odds with Bontate.\n\nThe Second Mafia War raged from 1981 to 1983. In fact, two wars were being waged simultaneously by the Corleonesi clan. Riina had secretly formed an alliance of mafiosi in different families, cutting across clan divisions, in defiance of the rules concerning loyalty in Cosa Nostra. This secretive inter-family group would become known as the Corleonesi. The Corleonesi slaughtered the ruling families of the Palermo Mafia to take control of the organisation while waging a parallel war against Italian authorities and law enforcement to intimidate and prevent effective investigations and prosecutions.\n\nThe Corleonesi initiated the war against the coalition led by Bontade and Badalamenti to try to control heroin trafficking. They began by first eliminating Bontade's allies outside Palermo, including Giuseppe Di Cristina and Giuseppe Calderone, the bosses of Riesi and Catania, in an effort to isolate the Palermitan bosses. Despite the larger economic means and the wider international network, the Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo-Badalamenti network was unable to withstand the ruthless violence of the Corleonesi. The most important members of the Inzerillo, Spatola and Gambino clans were arrested in March 1980 for heroin trafficking, which undermined Bontade's position significantly.\n\nOn 23 April 1981, whilst driving home from his 42nd birthday party, Bontade was machine gunned to death in his car, a Giulietta 2000, in Palermo. The slaying was carried out by Riina's favourite hitman Pino Greco also known as the \"little old shoe\" (scarpuzzedda) – a nephew of Michele Greco. Bontade's close ally, Salvatore Inzerillo, was killed three weeks later with the same Kalashnikov.\n\nMany of Bontade's friends, fellow mafiosi and relatives were cut down in the following months to prevent them from avenging the death of their boss. One of Bontade's close friends was Tommaso Buscetta, who subsequently became a pentito (collaborating witness) after he was arrested in Brazil in 1983. Salvatore Contorno, one of Bontade's trusted aides, followed Buscetta's example. They were the key witnesses that enabled prosecuting magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the Antimafia pool to successfully prosecute the Mafia in the Maxi Trial in the mid-1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "2000012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000012", "title": "Wigilia", "text": "Wigilia\n\nWigilia () is the traditional Christmas Eve vigil supper in Poland, held on December 24. The term is often applied to the whole of Christmas Eve, extending further to Pasterka - midnight Mass, held in Roman Catholic churches all over Poland and in Polish communities worldwide at or before midnight. The custom is sometimes referred to as \"wieczerza\" or \"wieczerza wigilijna\", in Old Polish meaning evening repast, linked to the late church service, \"Vespers\" from the \"Latin\". \n\nThe word \"Wigilia\" derives from the Latin \"vigil\". The associated feasting follows a day of abstinence and traditionally begins once the First Star has been sighted. Christmas is also sometimes called \"\"Gwiazdka\"\", \"little star\".\n\nChildren usually decorate the Christmas tree. Sometimes a handful of hay is placed under the tablecloth of the dining table to symbolise Jesus's birth in a manger. One old tradition states that when children playfully remove a piece of straw from under the tablecloth, its colour has meaning: Green indicates wealth or possibly a marriage, while black augurs bad luck for the year.\n\nAnother tradition, is to make an extra place-setting for the \"unexpected guest\", to celebrate hospitality. The feast begins with Grace and breaking of the \"Christmas wafer\" \"opłatek\" - to symbolise the gift of daily bread and wishing each other blessings for the coming year. In the country, it was customary to share a special (pink) wafer with livestock and dogs and cats as the animals of the household were to be treated with special reverence on that day, in honour of the animals in the Bethlehem stable. There was a belief that at midnight they were granted the power of human speech.\n\nA Christmas Eve dinner excludes meat, as \" abstinence\" is required and should comprise twelve distinct dishes in memory of the twelve Apostles. It begins with a soup, either Borscht with Uszka (tortellini), or wild mushroom consommé (grzybowa), followed by herring in different forms. Fish provides the main dish of the Christmas Eve feast across Poland. There are variations of carp fillet, carp in aspic, gefilte fish (Jewish-style carp), sweet with onions, carrots, almonds and raisins. Accompaniments consist of cabbage, cooked red or Sauerkraut with apple salad. The bread served at the meal is often Challah, doubtless borrowed from Poland's centuries-long Jewish fellow countrymen. Then there is an array of desserts, including dried fruit compote, followed by cake: poppy seed cakes, \"babka\", \"makowiec\" , and other delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments. Regional variants include, \"żurek\" sour rye soup, \"siemieniotka\" (in Silesia), Kulebiak, pierogi filled with cheese and potatoes as well mushrooms and cabbage, stuffed cabbage with mushrooms and rice, \"gołąbki\" (cabbage rolls), \"kluski\" with poppyseed, and \"makówki\" (in Silesia). There is in places a belief that whatever happens on Wigilia affects the incoming year; if a quarrel should arise, it foretells a quarrelsome and troublesome year.\n\nSome families as well as individual worshippers attend the traditional midnight mass/Shepherd's Mass (\"pasterka\"), where Christmas carols are also sung.\n\nA major part of the Wigilia festivities is the opening of gifts. The children often open their gifts and hand out the gifts for the adults from under the tree. The gift-givers in Polish tradition are \"Aniołek\", an angel, \"Gwiazdka\", a star – Saint Nicholas' feminine counterpart – or the Gwiazdor (masculine), which is either a Pagan tradition or represents the little Star of Bethlehem. Saint Nicholas traditionally used to bring gifts on December 6. This varies and in some families Saint Nicholas brings presents both on the 6th and at Christmas.\n\nChristmas Day is a national holiday in Poland and most Poles spend the day with their family. After (Wigilia) there are two more days of celebrations. Christmas breakfast often consists of scrambled eggs, cold-cuts served with horseradish sauce, smoked or fried salmon, marinated salads, and cakes, especially, pierniki Toruńskie (a gingerbread), cake, and decorated biscuits.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000016", "title": "Ernak", "text": "Ernak\n\nErnak was the last known ruler of the Huns, and the third son of Attila. After Attila's death in 453 AD, his Empire crumbled and its remains were ruled by his three sons, Ellac, Dengizich and Ernak. He succeeded his older brother Ellac in 454 AD, and probably ruled simultaneously over Huns in dual kingship with his brother Dengizich, but in separate divisions in separate lands.\n\nPriscus during his stay at Attila's court in 448 or 449 AD, recorded a personal occasion between Attila and Ernak. At a banquet Attila looked on him with serene eyes, while taking small account of his other sons. He was Attila's favorite son, because as a certain Hun explained to him, the Hunnic prophets prophesied his \"genos\" would fail, but would be restored by this son.\n\nErnak has often been identified with \"Irnik\" from the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans, who is noted as a descendant of the Dulo clan and leader of the Bulgars for 150 years, starting approximately from 437 AD.\n\nThe oldest brother Ellac died in 454 AD, at the Battle of Nedao. Jordanes recorded \"\"When Ellac was slain, his remaining brothers were put to fight near the shore of the Sea of Pontus where we have said the Goths settled ... dwelling again in their ancient abodes\"\". Jordanes recounts c. 454-455:\n\"\"[After the Ostrogoths led by their king Valamir, and his brothers Theodemir and Vidimir received Pannonia] Now it happened that the sons of Attila, regarding the Goths as deserters from their rule, came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves and attacked Valamir alone, when his brothers knew nothing of it. He sustained their attack, though he had but few with him, and after harassing them a long time, so utterly overwhelmed them that scarcely a portion of the enemy remained. The remnant turned in flight and sought the parts of Scythia which border on the stream of the river Danaber, which the Huns call in their own tongue Var. Whereupon he sent a messenger of good tidings to his brother Theodemir ... on the very day the messenger arrived ... Theoderic was born [in 454]\"\". \n\n\"\"Hernac, the younger son of Attila, with hiw followers, chose a home in the most distant part of Scythia Minor. Emnetzur and Ultzindur kinsmen of his, seized by force Oescus and Vtus and Almus in Dacia on the bank of the Danube, and many of the Huns, then swarming everywhere, betook themselves into Romania; descendants of them are to this day called Sacromontisi and Fossatisii\"\".\nThe toponyms \"Vtus\" (at the mouth of river Vit), \"Oescus\", near present Gigen at the mouth of river Iskar, and \"Almus\", the present Lom, were situated in Dacia Ripensis. The \"Sacromontisi\" may have received their name from the holy mountain in Thrace, while the \"Fossatisii\" (\"fossatum\", military camp) linguistically points to Moesia. Jordanes makes distinction between the Huns who \"seized\" land, and Alanic and Germanic tribes who \"received\" it.\n\nIn early 458, Western Roman Emperor Majorian gathered a vast army formed by barbarian tribes, including \"Chunus\", for the campaign against the Vandals. Sidonius Apollinaris recounts that \"\"...around thee thronged thousands under diverse standards. Only one race denied thee obedience, a race who had lately, in a mood even more savage than their wont, withdrawn their untamed host from the Danube because they had lost their lords in warfare, and Tuldila stirred in that unruly multitude a mad lust for fight which they must needs pay dear\"\". This account refers to the loss of Ellac and other chieftains, the Battle of Nedao was fought only few years before, and they withdrawn from the Danube, now occupied by former Germanic subjects. Those Huns were situated in Moesia Superior and Dacia Ripensis.\n\nPriscus recorded that in 465-466, Dengizich and Ernak sent diplomats to Constantinople. They wanted a peace treaty, and a market place on Danube \"according to the ancient customs\" between Romans and Huns, but were rejected. While Dengizich died in 469, it is considered that Ernak managed to maintain peaceful relations with the Romans living in the Dobruja region. It seems he was content, compared to Dengizich, with the limited land he was given. The fate of Ernak is unclear.\n\nThe name is recorded in two, possibly three variants, \"Ήρνάχ\" (Ernakh) by Priscus, and \"Hernac\" by Jordanes in \"Getica\", and possibly \"Ирникъ\" (Irnik) in Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans. Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen discounted this last connection, arguing that the name is just as similar to the Armenian Arnak, a figure living at the same time as Ernak, as it is to Irnik. Nicholas Poppe argued that the name originally had \"h-\" in initial position (\"er\" < \"här\", \"her\").\n\nOmeljan Pritsak derived the name from Turkic \"erän\", irregular plural of \"ēr\", meaning \"man, real man, hero\". He argued that the ending \"-nik\" was a diminutive suffix, \"-näk\" or \"-nik\", found only in the Altaic dialects, sometime also used as an augmentation. The name, reconstructed by Pritsak as \"Hērnäk\", could thus mean both \"hero\" and \"little [lucky] man\".\n\nMaenchen-Helfen, while aware of Pritsak's theory, considered the name to be of unknown origin.\n\nIrnik, a village in Bulgaria is named after Irnik (Ernak).\n\nIrnik Point on Snow Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Irnik (Ernak).\n\n"}
{"id": "2000026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000026", "title": "Sick man of Asia", "text": "Sick man of Asia\n\nThe phrase \"Sick man of Asia\" or \"Sick man of East Asia\" () originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was riven by internal divisions and taken advantage of by the great powers. British merchants were importing opium into China in order to trade for tea. Many people were addicted, thus possibly one source of the term \"sick\". The Qing dynasty (1644-1911) Emperor was forced to sign a series of unequal treaties, culminating in the Japanese invasion of China from 1937 to 1945. The Qing government was also undergoing social unrest, economic distress, corruption and political disintegration at the time, thus a \"sick\" state or society.\n\nThe term \"sick man\" may be considered derogatory as it implies a weakened nation. The phrase supposedly originated around 1895 as a parallel to the \"sick man of Europe\", referring to the 1853 description by Tsar Nicholas I of the weakening Ottoman Empire and later to the weakening position of the Habsburg dynasty in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After World War I the phrase was applied to various European countries including France, Italy, the UK, Spain and Germany\n\nOne of the most prominent 20th-century uses of the phrase was in the 1972 Hong Kong film Fist of Fury (also released as \"The Chinese Connection\") starring Bruce Lee, which was released across Asia.\n\nBut like the \"sick man of Europe\" term, it has also been used to refer to other Asian countries in the 21st century.\n\nFor example, in an article entitled \"The Sick Man of Asia\" Michael Auslin refers to Japan, not China (writing in \"Foreign Affairs\", 3 April 2009).\n\nAnd in a 9 March 2018 article in \"Consult-Myanmar\" entitled \"Myanmar No Longer the \"sick man\" of ASEAN - the Honour Goes To...\" both Myanmar and Thailand are called the \"sick man of ASEAN\".\n\nIn another example, in 2014 at the Euromoney Philippines Investment Forum 2014, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines publicly defended his country from being labelled as the new \"sick man of Asia\", citing a Japan External Trade Organization survey that showed \"the Philippines as the second most profitable among ASEAN-5 countries, next to Thailand.\" Reasons for the perceptions Aquino was refuting include its unequal prosperity and serious poverty, since from 2000 to 2006 its nominal income grew by 37% while its Gini coefficient only fell by 5%. Another cause for the \"Sick Man\" label includes Filipino political corruption scandals such as the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam.\n\nIn 2020, an opinion piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\" by Walter Russell Mead regarding the COVID-19 epidemic was entitled, \"China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia\". The article elicited anger from some Chinese people and the Chinese Government; in retaliation, the Chinese authorities revoked the press credentials of three \"Wall Street Journal\" reporters and ordered their expulsion.\n\n"}
{"id": "2000031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000031", "title": "Toller Cranston", "text": "Toller Cranston\n\nToller Shalitoe Montague Cranston, CM (April 20, 1949 – January 24, 2015) was a Canadian figure skater and painter. He won the 1971–1976 Canadian national championships, the 1974 World bronze medal and the 1976 Olympic bronze medal. Despite never winning at the World Figure Skating Championships due to his poor compulsory figures, he won the small medal for free skating at the 1972 and 1974 championships. Cranston is credited by many with having brought a new level of artistry to men's figure skating.\n\nCranston was born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1949 and grew up in Kirkland Lake. When he was 11, his family moved to suburban Montreal. Growing up, Cranston had an uneasy relationship with his family, especially his mother, who was a painter and who he says had a domineering and self-centred personality. He later compared his childhood to \"being in jail\". In school he had the habit of asking provocative questions that made his teachers think he was being disruptive. Although he enjoyed history, he disliked more structured subjects like mathematics.\n\nAfter high school, Cranston attended the École des beaux-arts de Montréal. By his third year, he became restless with his studies. One of his teachers suggested that there was nothing more he could learn at the school, so Cranston set out at that point to establish himself as a professional artist.\n\nIn 1976, he teamed up with personal manager Elva Oglanby to write his first book, \"Toller\", a mixture of autobiography, sketches, poems, paintings, humour and tongue-in-cheek observations. It reached number two in the Canadian non-fiction charts. Cranston co-wrote the autobiographical \"Zero \" (1997) with Martha Lowder Kimball, and a second volume, \"When Hell Freezes Over: Should I Bring My Skates?\" (2000), also with Kimball. While he described a sexual tryst between himself and Ondrej Nepela in the second book as well as affairs with women, in his books he presents himself as having lived without forming strong romantic or emotional attachments.\n\nAfter leaving the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Cranston became self-supporting as an artist, making enough money to cover his skating expenses. He held his first exhibition at his coach Ellen Burka's home in the spring of 1969. In November 1971, he had another successful one-man show in Toronto, the result of almost a year's work. Thereafter, he continued to have gallery and museum displays, with over 250 exhibitions around the world. He continued to paint even after his official retirement. His estate paintings are currently on display at Artworld Fine Art in Toronto.\n\nAfter an initial failed experience with ballet lessons, Cranston started skating at the age of 7, when his parents bought him hockey skates. He experimented on his own with trying to dance on the ice, and was only later told that what he was doing was called \"figure skating\". His mother was reluctant to allow him to pursue the sport seriously, but at the age of 11 he met Eva Vasak, who was impressed by his talent and offered to coach him for free. Vasak coached him for the next eight years.\n\nWhen Cranston was 13, he developed Osgood–Schlatter disease and was initially told that he would never skate again. After eight weeks in a cast, he resumed training, and won the 1964 Canadian Junior Championship the next month. In the next few years, however, Cranston met with little success at the senior level. As he was dividing his attention with art school at this time, his physical conditioning was poor and he struggled to make it through his programs, which at that time were 5 minutes for senior men.\n\nAfter failing to make the Canadian team for the 1968 Winter Olympics, Cranston struggled with motivation and lack of training discipline. His career turned a corner in the following season when he began to work with coach Ellen Burka in Toronto. Burka required him to do complete run-throughs of his entire program and his results began to improve: third at the Canadian championships in 1969, and second in 1970.\n\nCranston was a clockwise spinner and jumper. He quickly gained a reputation as the most innovative and exciting artistic skater of his time, one of the first to emphasize use of the whole body to express the music as well as to execute skating moves in best form, to lie down while sliding down the ice and to wear elaborate costumes. He was particularly known for the quality and inventiveness of his spins, which were widely copied by other skaters. The quality of his precision landings and inventive choreography was topped by his combination jumps that included triple revolution jumps. Soon reports from competitions of this period began to mention younger skaters who had become \"Tollerized\" by attempting to copy Cranston's style, which was characterized by contrasting very stretched positions with a high free leg with more angular, bent-leg positions, and the incorporation of elements such as running toe steps and high kicks in step sequences. Many of his original spins included many changes of positions that seemed to defy gravity. His Russian split jump was \"over split\" which brought his skates up to shoulder height instead of waist height.\n\nEven during his competitive career, Cranston had talked about his goal in skating being to create what he called \"theatre on ice\", or skating as a form of dance expression, rather than winning medals. He explained that the purpose of perfecting the technical aspects of the sport was to allow the body to express the music or emotion.\n\nCranston won his first national title in 1971 with a performance that included triple Salchow and loop jumps, and received a standing ovation from the audience. It was in the 1972 season that he truly established his reputation in the sport. At the 1972 Canadian championships, his marks included four 6.0s for artistic impression and six 5.9s for technical merit. At this time the artistic impression mark was supposed to be graded on the quality of the jumps, landings and spins and the choreography to the music. Cranston skated poor compulsory figures at the 1972 Winter Olympics, but turned in a strong program to finish 5th in the free skating. At the 1972 World Figure Skating Championships, he won the free skating medal with another superb performance, again landing triple loop and Salchow jumps and receiving a thunderous standing ovation as well as a perfect 6.0 mark for artistic impression. He won that same medal again at the 1974 World Figure Skating Championships in addition to winning the overall bronze medal. Toller Cranston also was the 1976 Olympic bronze medalist, again winning the free-skate medal.\n\nAfter the 1976 competitive season, Cranston began a long career in professional figure skating. Following up on his earlier-stated goal of developing \"theatre on ice\", Cranston performed and starred in the Broadway show, \"The Ice Show\", conceived and directed by Myrl A. Schreibman, produced and presented by Dennis Bass and performed at Broadway's THE PALACE THEATER. The show ran for six weeks and was extended for another four weeks. It also featured Gordon McKellen, Colleen O'Connor and James Millns, and several other former elite champion skaters including (during its run) Ken Shelly and Jo Jo Starbuck. It then was a special on ABC WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS performed in the arena in Montreal Canada. He later toured in Europe with Holiday on Ice, and in 1983 appeared in a short-lived production at Radio City Music Hall in New York City with Peggy Fleming and Robin Cousins.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Cranston made a series of skating specials for CBC television. The best of these was \"Strawberry Ice\" (1982), a fantasy that also featured Peggy Fleming, Sandra and Val Bezic, Allen Schramm, and Sarah Kawahara, with imaginative costumes designed by Frances Dafoe. The production won a variety of awards, including an ACTRA Award and was redistributed in 67 countries. Cranston's other TV specials included \"Dream Weaver\" (1979) and \"Magic Planet\" (1983).\n\nDuring this period Cranston was a regular on the Canadian variety TV show \"Stars on Ice\", and appeared in the similar NBC series \"The Big Show\" in 1980.\n\nHis other television credits included a cameo appearance in an ice ballet production of \"The Snow Queen\" (1982), starring John Curry and Janet Lynn. In 1983 he portrayed the character of Tybalt in \"Romeo and Juliet on Ice\", a production starring Brian Pockar and Dorothy Hamill as the title characters. He appeared in Joni Mitchell's concert film \"Shadows and Light\". He made a non-skating acting appearance in the 1983 short film \"I Am a Hotel\", a music video featuring songs by Leonard Cohen. He is also on the back cover of Joni Mitchell's album \"Hejira\".\n\nThroughout the 1980s, he was a regular competitor at the World Professional Figure Skating Championships and other made-for-TV pro skating events. In 1986, he was one of the cast members of the original IMG-produced American Stars on Ice tour (no relation to the earlier Canadian TV series of the same name), and appeared with the show for the next several years.\n\nCranston was also a commentator on CBC television for figure skating events. However, in 1991, the CBC fired him, citing concerns from the Canadian Figure Skating Association that his often brutally frank and opinionated commentary was denigrating to Canadian skaters. Cranston filed a lawsuit against the CBC that was eventually resolved in his favour.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, Cranston agreed to coach American skater Christopher Bowman, who moved into Cranston's home in Toronto. The influence of the notoriously unstable Bowman on Cranston's life was disastrous; Cranston later wrote, \"... drug dealers buzzed the front doorbell morning, noon, and night. Prostitutes invaded my house from the street. Christopher sometimes announced that he was going out for a carton of milk and didn't return for three days.\" Having lost the ability to tolerate Bowman's behavior any longer Cranston finally threw him out in the fall of 1991. Meanwhile, Cranston had become so depressed that he was unable to paint, and started taking drugs as well. At this time, he began to make changes in his lifestyle: He sold his Toronto house, which was cluttered with art he had collected over the years, and bought a house in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.\n\nCranston continued to perform in Canada with Stars on Ice and IMG's smaller-city tour, Skate the Nation, for the next few years. However, in the fall of 1994, he broke his leg while practicing for a holiday show in Vail, Colorado. Although he made a few skating appearances afterwards, in 1997 he decided to retire from professional skating before (as he described it) he became a parody of himself.\n\nFor retirement, Cranston took residence in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,where his large and opulently decorated home and studio, as well as his painting became his main artistic forms of expression. Cranston's work often incorporated themes related to skating.\n\nIn 2010, Cranston came back to skating for a short time as a guest judge for Battle of the Blades, a figure skating reality competition show on CBC Television. In 2013, he was appointed as the Official Artist of Skate Canada and produced the signature poster for the 2013 ISU World Figure Skating Championships in London, Ontario.\n\nCranston was found dead at his residence from an apparent heart attack on the morning of January 24, 2015, aged 65. Skate Canada paid tribute to him with a moment of silence at the Canadian Figure Skating Championships in Kingston, Ontario, which were being held around the time of his death. Toller's will was found invalid and his siblings were left in control of the estate and sold more than 12,000 items from his collection.\n\nCranston was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1976, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1996, the Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1997, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1997, and Canada's Walk of Fame in 2003. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1977 and received a Special Olympic Order from the Canadian Olympic Association in 1995. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n"}

It represented mainly General Electors and multiracial people, and claimed to follow moderate, centrist policies. From 2001 it was led by Mick Beddoes, the sole member elected from the party to the 71-member House of Representatives in the general election.\n\nThe party was dissolved in January 2013.\n\nThe party, originally called the United General Party, was formed in the late 1990s by a merger between the General Voters Party and the General Electors Association, formerly the All National Congress (ANC). This followed an earlier move in which ethnic Fijian members of the ANC had left to join the Fijian Association Party. Both groups were fragments of the old Alliance Party, the party which ruled Fiji from 1967 to 1987.\n\nIn 2003, the party announced a drive to broaden its base to attract support from Fiji's major ethnic communities, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians. On 2 August, Beddoes announced a decision to rename the party. The name \"General\" was associated with Fiji's minority communities, he said, and the party wanted a more inclusive name. The party's general secretary, Bruce Rounds, said on 2 November that a growing number of people from all ethnic groups had expressed interest in joining the party, and it had decided, in principle, to field candidates in all 71 constituencies in the general election expected to be held in 2006. The 2004 name change is one step the party has taken to recast itself as a multiracial party.\n\nThe United Peoples Party has been a vocal critic of the government's legislation to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, a proposed tribunal with the authority (subject to presidential approval) to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup d'état which deposed the elected government in 2000. Calling the proposal a recipe for disaster which would create a \"legal framework\" to pardon, at will, anyone convicted of coup-related offence, party leader Mick Beddoes said on 16 May 2005 that it would lead to the prevalence of the law of the jungle and would license any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so. He accused the government of pandering to its junior coalition partner, the Conservative Alliance, to which many of those convicted of coup-related offenses belong. On 14 June, the party announced the beginning of a Yellow Ribbon Campaign to promote a petition aimed at forcing the bill to be withdrawn, or at least significantly amended. On 17 June, Beddoes accused Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of lying about widespread public support for the bill, claiming that the \"small group of dissenters\" that the Prime Minister said existed were, in fact, the minority who knew what the bill contained. He said that asking the Fijian people to support the legislation without making them aware of its contents was \"\"a deliberate attempt to mislead the Fijian community.\"\"\n\nThe UPP announced on 28 June 2005 that Josephine Raikuna Williams, the former Mayor of Nadi, would be a candidate for the party at the general election expected to be held in 2006.\n\nThe Fijian electoral system employs the so-called alternate ballot, whereby votes cast for low-polling candidates may be transferred to higher-polling candidates according to the ranking specified by the candidate, which may be customized by the individual voter. It is usual, therefore, for parties to negotiate preference deals before elections. Mick Beddoes emphasized on 8 September 2005 that any such agreement with the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) or the National Alliance Party (NAPF) would have to be favourable to UPP candidates. They did not want to be caught, he said, in a situation in which the UPP merely collected votes to benefit other parties. He also said that some executives of the UPP were opposed to making any deals with other parties.\n\nOn 18 September, however, Beddoes announced that he was negotiating with FLP about the possibility of an electoral coalition. He also intended to negotiate with the National Alliance Party and possibly the National Federation Party, he said. On 16 October, he said that negotiations between the UPP and the FLP had finalized a deal, and that the UPP executive had endorsed it the day before. \"\"We share similar positions on issues of unemployment, poverty alleviation, health and other areas. It is also based on our belief in the rights of all our citizens and their need for equality under the law,\"\" Beddoes said. The two parties signed a memorandum of understanding on 2 December, agreeing to exchange preferences at the 2006 election. The agreement called for a joint manifesto to be drawn up, but left open the possibility of each party contesting any or all of the 71 seats separately, or of fielding joint candidates by mutual agreement. The agreement also left open the possibility of other parties joining the coalition.\n\nBeddoes had earlier announced on 10 October that the party hoped to field a full slate of candidates, comprising 36 indigenous Fijians, 26 Indo-Fijians, and 1 Rotuman, with each of the country's eight principal minority communities represented by one candidate each. Negotiations towards forming a coalition with other parties were ongoing, he said, but no final decision had been taken.\n\nThe coalition agreement with the FLP did not exclude deals with other parties, Beddoes emphasized on 15 December 2005. Talks with other parties about electoral pacts were continuing, he said.\n\nThe 2006 conference, held on 18–19 March, chose Loto Feifei (North Eastern), David Blakelock (Suva City), and Margaret Rounds (West Central) as the party's three vice-presidents.\n\nThe party won 1% of the vote and 2 out of 71 seats in the 2006 election.\n\nThe party opposed the 2006 Fijian coup d'état. However, Deputy Leader Bernadette Ganilau accepted a position in the 2007 interim government, and was asked to resign from the party in response.\n\nIn January 2013 the Fijian regime announced new political party registration rules which would make it difficult for parties to contest elections. In response the party announced that it was shutting down as it could not meet the required number of members. It urged its members to join one of the three remaining major political parties in an effort to shift them towards a more multiracial membership.\n"}

In terms of population, however, it is the most populated region with a population of 4,780,380 according to the 2011 census, accounting for 19.4% of Ghana's total population. The Ashanti Region is known for its major gold bar and cocoa production. The largest city and regional capital is Kumasi.\n\nThe Ashanti Region is centrally located in the middle belt of Ghana. It lies between longitudes 0.15W and 2.25W, and latitudes 5.50N and 7.46N. The region shares boundaries with six of the sixteen political regions, Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regions in the north, Eastern region in the east, Central region in the south and Western region in the South west. The region is divided into 27 districts, each headed by a District Chief Executive.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral festivals are celebrated in the region, the major ones being the Akwasidae and Adae Kese. These are religious festivals celebrated by some members of the Akan ethnic group of which the Ashanti belong.\nThe festivals are celebrated to remember past leaders and heroes. Though they are dead, their spirits are believed to be alive and taking interest in the affairs of the living, watching their actions, and consulting with them during the Adae festival.\n\n\nThe center of population of the Ashanti Region is located in the Kumasi Metropolitan District.

Majority of Ashanti region's population are Ethnic Akans and citizens by birth (94.2%) with five per cent naturalized Ghanaians. A smaller proportion (5.8%) of the population originate from outside Ashanti and Akanland or Ghana, made up of 3.7 per cent mainly from the five English-speaking countries of ECOWAS and 2.1 per cent from other African countries.

{"id": "2000074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000074", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross (film)", "text": "Glengarry Glen Ross (film)\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is a 1992 American drama film adapted by David Mamet from his 1984 Pulitzer Prize–winning play of the same name, and directed by James Foley. The film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how desperate they become when the corporate office sends a trainer to \"motivate\" them. He tells them that, in a week's time, all except the top two salesmen will be fired. The story is set in Chicago; it was filmed in New York City.\n\nLike the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as \"Death of a Fuckin' Salesman\". The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.\n\nThe world premiere of the film was held at the 49th Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. Al Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the film. Though the film performed modestly at the box office, grossing $10.7 million in North America on a $12.5 million budget, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" was lauded by critics and is considered a classic film.\n\nAct I\nFour real estate salesmen, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), Dave Moss (Ed Harris), and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), work in the offices of Premiere Properties, Chicago. The salesmen act more as con artists, lying about their identities and circumstances, in selling parcels of land in Florida and Arizona to customers, many of whom are uninterested or unable to afford a real estate investment. They rely on leads, information of potential customers, provided to them by office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey). The leads are purchased by their unseen bosses Mitch and Murray.\n\nA sales meeting is held by Blake (Alec Baldwin)a salesman \"from downtown\". In a profanity-laden tirade, he chastises the salesmen for their lack of sales and questions their manhood. Blake reveals that, in addition to the month's sale contest (whose winner and first runner-up receive a new Cadillac and a set of steak knives respectively), the bottom two salesmen will be fired. He stresses the mantra \"ABC–Always Be Closing\" and reveals that a valuable set of leads, the \"Glengarry leads\", have arrived, but they will not be distributed to salesmen of their caliber. After Blake leaves, the salesmen split up for the rest of the evening.\n\nLevene:\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene was once a brilliant salesman, but has since fallen into a rut implied to be lasting months, perhaps even years. Adding to Levene's plight is that fact his daughter is sick in the hospital with an unspecified illness. After the others leave, Levene attempts to secure one of the premier leads from Williamson, who refuses on account of his recent sales record. Levene persists, first charming, then insulting, and finally bribing Williamson by offering him a part of his sales commission. Williamson agrees to 20 percent of the commission plus $50 per lead, but reneges on the deal when Levene is unable to pay upfront. Forced to leave with no good leads, Levene goes cold calling to a customer named Larry Spannel, but fails to close. Throughout the night, Levene is seen conversing on the phone with another lead, a couple named Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.\n\nMoss and Aaronow:\nMoss and Aaronow go out together on an unsuccessful sale. Throughout their trip, an incensed Moss rants to a passive Aaronow about the state of affairs with the company, complaining about the business model where the top leads goes to the most successful salesmen and how Mitch and Murray take 90 percent of their sale. Upon returning to the Chinese restaurant across from the office, Moss proposes that someone strike back against Mitch and Murray by stealing the Glengarry leads and selling them to Jerry Graf, a colleague who has done well in his own business. Aaronow correctly deduces that Moss has indeed discussed an endeavor with Graf. Moss offers to let Aaronow in on the deal, which includes $2,500 and a job with Graf. The latter expresses interest, but balks when Moss tells him he must be the one to break into the office and steal the leads, and it must be done that night. Aaronow tries to remove himself from the topic, but Moss says he is already an accessory to the crime, simply because he listened.\n\nRoma: \nRichard \"Ricky\" Roma is by far the top salesman in the office. Rather than attend Blake's meeting, Roma instead stays at the Chinese restaurant, where he meets and converses with a timid man named James Lingk. Roma wows Lingk with philosophical monologues and puts him at ease, not once even mentioning real estate until the end of the scene. Convincing Lingk to be more outgoing with his life, Roma presents him literature about land in Florida.\n\nAct II\nThe next morning, it's revealed the office has been broken into. Leads and the salesmen's phones have been stolen. Police are on the scene and a detective is set to interview each of the salesmen. Roma arrives and pesters Williamson about the status of his latest sales contract, that of James Lingk's. Williamson says it has been filed at the bank, leading Roma to declare himself the winner of the Cadillac, since this sale puts him \"over the top\". Roma further insults Williamson by refusing to act on old leads. He then goes on to ease Aaronow, who is nervous about talking to the detective.\n\nAn overjoyed Levene arrives, announcing he has closed an $82,000 sale with the Nyborgs. While Roma is eager to hear Levene's story, a furious Moss, emerging from his interview with the detective, expresses only vitriol. Roma reminds Moss that he hasn't made a big sale in a month, causing Moss to furiously curse Roma out and storm out of the office, declaring he is \"going to Wisconsin\". Levene finishes his story to Roma, who congratulates him on his sale.\n\nEnergized with the close, Levene demands new leads and insults Williamson, who is left speechless. Roma, seeing Lingk arrive at the office, has Levene pose as his client and tries to usher him off to the airport to avoid a discussion. Lingk reveals that his wife told him to ask for his check back and that she has threatened to call the state's attorney. After a hysterical Aaronow emerges from his interview, Roma tries to put Lingk's mind at ease, eventually convincing him to get a drink and that his check has not been cashed yet. However, the ruse is ruined when Williamson (who erroneously believed that Lingk was worried about whether his check was stolen) claims that the check is already at the bank and has been cashed. A distressed Lingk leaves, causing Roma to launch into a profanity-laden tirade against him before going into his interview.\n\nLevene piles onto Williamson, ending his own rant by telling him \"if you're going to make something up, be sure that it helps\". Williamson realizes that Levene knows that the Lingk contract was still on his desk, something only the one who robbed the office would know. Confronted by Williamson, Levene denies the accusation at first, but eventually reveals he sold the leads to Jerry Graf, working with Moss. When Williamson nonetheless threatens to go to the police, Levene tries once more to charm and bribe his way out of the situation. He offers Williamson his entire cut from the Graf deal, which is rejected. When he offers a bigger cut of his commission, citing his new sale, Williamson reveals that the Nyborgs are mentally ill and unable to afford such pricy real estate and that \"they just like talking to salesmen\". Levene makes one last plea by mentioning his daughter, but Williamson coldly rebuffs him.\n\nUnaware of what's transpired, Roma emerges from his interrogation and praises Levene for his acting during the Lingk situation. He proposes that he and Levene enter business together. As Roma makes a call on a newly installed phone, Levene is called in by the detective. He tries to say something to Roma, who is entrenched in his call. Defeated, Levene walks into the office. While Roma goes off to the restaurant, Aaronow starts making his sales calls.\n\n\nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the National Theatre, London. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984. That same year, the play made its American debut in Chicago before moving to Broadway. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to New York City in 1985 at the suggestion of director Irvin Kershner who wanted to make it into a film. Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a Washington, D.C. based producer of B movies who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks and New Line Cinema over the course of four years.\n\nAl Pacino originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, \"American Buffalo\", in London. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked Jack Lemmon to act in the film. During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. Alec Baldwin, also attached, was earmarked to play the Roma role vacated by Pacino. He reportedly left the project over a contract disagreement, the real reason being Pacino was still being considered for Roma, and would be cast over Baldwin if he elected to accept the role. James Foley's agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\". Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years. Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\" The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in Los Angeles. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about \"names\"\". Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the Creative Artists Agency, who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients – Ed Harris and Kevin Spacey – soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on. This did not stop other actors, like Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, and Joe Mantegna, from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a Tony Award in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, and on location in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, over 39 days. Harris remembers: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\". Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\". During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.\n\nThe film's director of photography, Juan Ruiz Anchía, relied on low lighting and shadows. A blues, greens, and reds color scheme was used for the first part of the film, while the second half had a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\n\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film. Tokofsky sued to strip Zupnik of his producer's credit and share of the producer's fee. Zupnik claimed that he personally put up $2 million of the film's budget and countersued, claiming that Tokofsky was fired for embezzlement.\n\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. In addition, it was originally slated to be shown at the Montreal Film Festival, but it was necessary to show it out of competition because it was entered into competition at the Venice Film Festival at the same time. Instead, it was given its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film opened in wide release on October 2, 1992 in 416 theaters, grossing $2.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $10.7 million in North America, below its $12.5 million budget.\n\nThe film has a rating of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The consensus reads, \"This adaptation of David Mamet's play is every bit as compelling and witty as its source material, thanks in large part to a clever script and a bevy of powerhouse actors.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 80 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman gave the film an \"A\" rating in his review for \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine, praising Lemmon's performance as \"a revelation\" and describing his character as \"the weaselly soul of \"Glengarry Glen Ross\"–Willy Loman turned into a one-liner\". In his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert wrote, \"Mamet's dialogue has a kind of logic, a cadence, that allows people to arrive in triumph at the ends of sentences we could not possibly have imagined. There is great energy in it. You can see the joy with which these actors get their teeth into these great lines, after living through movies in which flat dialogue serves only to advance the story\".\n\n\"Newsweek\" magazine's Jack Kroll observed of Alec Baldwin's performance, \"Baldwin is sleekly sinister in the role of Blake, a troubleshooter called in to shake up the salesmen. He shakes them up, all right, but this character (not in the original play) also shakes up the movie's toned balance with his sheer noise and scatological fury\". In his review for \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby praised, \"the utterly demonic skill with which these foulmouthed characters carve one another up in futile attempts to stave off disaster. It's also because of the breathtaking wizardry with which Mr. Mamet and Mr. Foley have made a vivid, living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work\".\n\nIn his review for \"Time\", Richard Corliss wrote, \"A peerless ensemble of actors fills \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" with audible glares and shudders. The play was zippy black comedy about predators in twilight; the film is a photo-essay, shot in morgue closeup, about the difficulty most people have convincing themselves that what they do matters\". However, Desson Howe's review in \"The Washington Post\" criticized Foley's direction, writing that it \"doesn't add much more than the street between. If his intention is to create a sense of claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie\".\n\nThe film has had an enduring legacy for its memorable dialogue and performances, particularly that of Alec Baldwin, whose character was created for the film adaptation. In 2012, on the 20th anniversary of its release, David Wagner of \"The Atlantic\" dubbed it a cult classic and Tim Grierson of \"Deadspin\" cited it as one of the \"quintessential modern movies about masculinity.\" In 2014, English critic Philip French described the ensemble of Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Alec Baldwin as \"one of the best American casts ever assembled.\"\n\nJack Lemmon was voted Best Actor by the National Board of Review. Al Pacino was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor but did not win. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role but lost to Gene Hackman for \"Unforgiven\"; the same year he was nominated for and won the Best Actor Oscar for \"Scent of a Woman\". \"Empire\" magazine voted the film the 470th greatest film in their \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list.\n\n"}

Folkenberg\n\nRobert Stanley Folkenberg (January 1, 1941 – December 24, 2015) served as General Conference president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church from 1990 through to his resignation in 1999. His tenure was marked by an unprecedented growth in church membership and his “Global Mission initiative” in the Adventist Church. After his resignation to the President position he worked within the laity of the church through worldwide programs through ShareHim/Global Evangelism.\n\nFolkenberg was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico on 1 January 1941 to North American missionaries serving in Latin America and Central America.

The next year, Folkenberg enrolled in Atlantic Union College where he remained for one year before a one-year stint at Newbold College. In 1962, Folkenberg graduated from Andrews University and obtained his masters in New Testament theology from Andrews in 1963.\n\nPrior to his election as General Conference President in 1990, Folkenberg served as President of the Carolina Conference.\n\nHis move in 1998 to establish a \"Board of Ministerial and Theological Education\" in every Division of the church was criticised and put on hold.\n\nHe championed the vision of a “Global Mission initiative” in the Adventist Church. An expected long tenure as president was cut short by his decision to resign amid allegations of financial impropriety in his personal life. His decision was not an admission of guilt but rather an expression of concern that the church not be marred by his cooperation in the investigation. A \"Christianity Today\" article says \"During his presidency, Folkenberg, known for a somewhat brusque management style, shook up the denomination, spearheading mass communications initiatives that have led to massive growth in membership\". According to Lawrence Geraty, then president of La Sierra University, while Folkenberg \"never asked anyone to do what he himself was not willing to do,\" his style raised hackles.\n\nRobert Folkenberg died just before his 75th birthday on December 24, 2015, from a recurrence of colon cancer, at his home in Winter Haven, Florida, surrounded by family.\n\nRobert Folkenberg had business dealings with James Moore, who was convicted of grand-theft felony in 1987. In August 21, 1998, Moore sued Folkenberg, the General Conference Corporation, and Inter-America Division, alleging that Folkenberg had stolen 8,000,000 dollars from him. The suit was settled out of court on February 26, 1999. Meetings were held by ADCOM on January 27, and 28 of that year, questioning Folkenberg on his dealings. They asked him to resign, but he refused. Finally on February 7, 1999, he resigned his position as president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the only son of Russian General-in-chief Roman Illarionovich Vorontsov (1707—1783) and Marfa Ivanovna Surmina (1718—1745). In 1759, Alexander's uncle, the grand chancellor Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, sent him to Strasbourg, Paris and Madrid to train him in diplomacy. Under Peter III, who was in love with his sister Elizabeth, he represented Russia for a short time at the court of St James's. Catherine II created him a senator and president of the Board of Trade; but she never liked him, and ultimately (1791) compelled him to retire from public life.\n\nIn 1802, Alexander I summoned him back to office and appointed him imperial chancellor.

{"id": "2000128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000128", "title": "Online identity", "text": "Online identity\n\nInternet identity (IID), also online identity or internet persona, is a social identity that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.\n\nIn some online contexts, including Internet forums, online chats, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity. Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a reputation, which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of trust. Online identities are associated with users through authentication, which typically requires registration and logging in. Some websites also use the user's IP address or tracking cookies to identify users.\n\nThe concept of the self, and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as education, psychology and sociology. The online disinhibition effect is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification.\n\nThe social web, i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to express and expose their identity in a social context.\nFor example, people define their identity explicitly by creating user profiles in social network services such as Facebook or LinkedIn and online dating services. By expressing opinions on blogs and other social media, they define more tacit identities.\n\nThe disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues related to privacy. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online. Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort.\n\nThe emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. Social networking services and online avatars have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies.\n\nOnline activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well. Avi Marciano has coined the term \"VirtuReal\" to resolve the contested relationship between online and offline environments in relation to identity formation. Studying online usage patterns of transgender people, he suggested that the internet can be used as preliminary, complementary, and/or alternative sphere. He concludes that although \"the offline world sets boundaries that potentially limit the latitude within the online world, these boundaries are wide enough to allow mediated agency that empowers transgender users. Consequently, the term VirtuReal \"reflects both the fact that it provides an empowering virtual experience that compensates for offline social inferiority, and the fact that it is nevertheless subject to offline restrictions\".\n\nDorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne in their contribution to the book \"Building Virtual Communities\" explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of \"masking\" identity. They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, gender, address, username and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics.\n\nThe kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the \"metaphor\" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a rock star online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally false identity, this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask.\n\nBecause of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear.\n\nWiszniewski and Coyne state \"Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification.\" Students interacting in an online community must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity', whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online.\n\nAs blogs allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as WordPress or in interest-centered sites like Blogster, to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their \"real\" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.\n\nDigital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting. The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.\n\nOnline social networks like Facebook and MySpace allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.\n\nSome users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com writes under the name of Kel Campbell – a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it.\n\nSuch are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The \"I\" becomes subject to the \"Me\", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their \"hidden extroversion\" or \"unknown creativity\" or becoming \"someone else\" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can \"create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new\".\n\nThe possibilities are endless – which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present.\n\nIn the development of social networks, there has appeared a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of WeChat called wei-businessmen (Wechat businessman, a new form of e-commerce in Wechat) who sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in the real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. They need to invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, which in turn increases the chance other users will purchase from them.\n\nOnline identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments. With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom. For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal. For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity.\n\nWith the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics. Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say.\n\nCommunication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith).\n\nOnline learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them.\n\nIn Virtual world, the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality.\n\nAn Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.\nThere are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, some question-and-answer websites like \"ZhiHu\" in China are open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous.\n\nA discussed positive aspect of virtual communities is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced.\n\nThis freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world.\n\nOnline identity has a beneficial effect for minority groups, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of inclusion.\n\nA prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: \"The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news\". If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had.\n\nThe online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray. As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), \"The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an \"option\" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted.\"\n\nOnline identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions. Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of \"normalization\" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety.\n\nPrimarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about child pornography and the ability of pedophiles to obscure their identity.\n\nFinally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions. As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other.\n\nThe identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services. In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'.\n\nVan Gelder reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords.\n\nCatfishing is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user. Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show \"\".\n\nA problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on eBay cannot be transferred to Slashdot.\n\nMultiple proposals have been made to build an identity management infrastructure into the Web protocols. All of them require an effective public key infrastructure so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on Wikipedia and another on Twitter) are probably one and the same.\n\nOpenID, an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID.\n\nGiven the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet. When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the prisoner's dilemma: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed reputation management systems, such as eBay's feedback system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites.\n\nAn online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their digital footprint. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online. Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a brick and mortar shop is usually more trusted.\n\nUltimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p. 160) discusses, \"the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user.\" Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the \"real world.\"\n\nThis issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. \"Disembodiment\" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and virtual sex. As McRae states, \"Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits\". At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.\n\nThe future of online anonymity depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed. Law enforcement officials often express their opposition to online anonymity and pseudonymity, which they view as an open invitation to criminals who wish to disguise their identities. Therefore, they call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's legal identity]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national identity document. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, has stated that the Google+ social network is intended to be exactly such an identity system. The controversy resulting from Google+'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the \"nymwars\".\n\nOnline civil rights advocates, in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility.\n\nAn online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.\n\nThe most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children. \"Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond.\" The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age.\n\nThe show Dateline on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by Chris Hansen, an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. \"Dateline\" held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all.\n\nFederal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim. In California, where one \"Dateline\" investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually-tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious.\n\nAn online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called EverQuest, which is owned by Sony Online Entertainment, Inc., attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay. Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's intellectual property, and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a copyright infringement lawsuit if it failed to comply. Left unresolved is a fundamental question: Who owns an online identity created at a commercial Web site? Does an online identity belong to the person who created it, or to the company that owns the software used to create the identity?\n\n"}
{"id": "2000131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000131", "title": "Peter Sam", "text": "Peter Sam\n\nPeter Sam (originally called Stuart) is a fictional narrow gauge steam locomotive character in \"The Railway Series\" children's books by the Rev. W. Awdry and the spin-off TV series \"Thomas and Friends\". Peter Sam lives and works on the Skarloey Railway on the Island of Sodor as engine No. 4.\n\nPeter Sam first appeared in \"The Railway Series\" in the story \"Sir Handel\". This story is set just after Peter Sam and Sir Handel had been purchased by the Thin Controller. Peter Sam was originally called Stuart and lived on the Mid Sodor Railway with Duke and Falcon When the railway closed in 1947, he and Falcon were sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company at Peel Godred for an expansion project. Following the project's completion in 1951, they were oiled, greased and sheeted under tarpaulins ready for disposal and stood for a year in the Company's yard. In 1952, they were purchased for the knockdown price of £50 (£25 each) by Sir Handel Lloyd Brown for service on the Skarloey Railway, overhauled and repainted in SR red livery at Crovan's Gate Works and renamed Peter Sam and Sir Handel respectively.\n\nPeter Sam holds a lot of respect for Skarloey, and often tries his best to prevent Sir Handel from getting into trouble. He is a friendly engine who aims to please, and is highly popular among the coaches. The trucks also respect him because he only bumps the trucks that misbehave.\n\nAfter an accident on the incline when collecting slate trucks, Peter Sam had difficulty steaming. His funnel was knocked off in a tunnel by an icicle. He was soon fitted with an experimental funnel (a Giesl ejector) which enables him to take heavier loads. At first, the others teased him for it, but they soon learned how it made work much easier for him, and now they even wish they had one like it. Peter Sam's friendliness is what keeps the other engines working happily with him.\n\nPeter Sam was introduced as Stuart in the fourth season of \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\". A number of Peter Sam's original adventures were adapted, with the same personality he had in the books.\n\nFor the next few seasons, his character waxed and waned. After being absent with the other Narrow Gauge engines for Season 8, he returned with the others that are for the new model series, set before the arrival of Mighty-Mac and the return of Fearless Freddie, (except Sir Handel) the following year, starring in the episode \"The Magic Lamp\". He still retains qualities from the books, and has had his flattened funnel since the \"Special Funnel\" adaptation in 1995. In recent episodes, Peter Sam has made cameos and other minor roles, but in Season 11 he made a couple of speaking roles. In Season 12, Peter Sam stars in \"Mountain Marvel\" where he finds a statue of Proteus.\n\nUnlike the Skarloey Railway of the books, where all the locomotives are painted red, in the TV series each is painted a different colour: Peter Sam retains his original green colour from The Mid-Sodor Railway. Also, Peter Sam's Giesl Ejector was more square flat than in the RWS. For his CGI appearance, though, he has an accurate Giesl.\n\nFrom Spring 2012 onwards, Peter Sam is now currently voiced by Steven Kynman (UK/US) in the CGI version of the series in both sides of the atlantic, respectively.\n\nPeter Sam appeared in the specials \"The Great Discovery\", \"Blue Mountain Mystery\", \"King of the Railway\", \"\", and \"\".\n\nPeter Sam is based on the locomotive \"Edward Thomas\" who works at the Talyllyn Railway in Gwynedd, Wales. This locomotive is a modified \"Tattoo\" class, built in 1921 by Kerr Stuart & Co at the California Works in Stoke-on-Trent for the gauge Corris Railway in Merionethshire, where he carried the number 4. The Corris Railway closed in 1948 and No. 4 was purchased (and named) by the Talyllyn in 1951. The Corris Railway built a new replica of No. 4 in 2005.\n"}

Bieniewski and K. Jewłaszewski) and Ukrainian Cossacks (represented by Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky and starshina Yuri Nemyrych, architect of the treaty, and Pavlo Teteria). It was designed to elevate the Cossacks and Ruthenians to the position equal to that of Poland and Lithuania in the Polish–Lithuanian union and in fact transforming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth (\"Rzeczpospolita Trojga Narodów\", \"Commonwealth of Three Nations\").\n\nThe list of points and humble requests that are submitted at his mercy by Serene Hetman of Zaporizhian Host along with the whole Zaporizhian Host and Russian [Ruthenian] people to his royal mercy and the whole Rzecz Pospolita:\n\n1. Creation of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Polish: \"Wielkie Księstwo Ruskie\") from Palatinatus Czernihoviensis, Palatinatus Kioviensis and Palatinatus Braclaviensis, which along with the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania would be part of one and indivisible \"Rzecz Pospolita\" (Rex Public) in equal rights.\n\n2. The duchy was to be governed by the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, elected for life from among four candidates that were chosen by all estates of Ukrainian society and confirmed by the King of Poland.\n\n3. In the duchy were to be established local offices in Polish manner.\n\n4. In the duchy were to be restored law and courts as well as the administrative – territorial system of governing that existed prior to 1648.\n\n5. The Grand Duchy of Ruthenia shall not have rights to independent relations with other counties.\n\n6. Individuals of Eastern Orthodox religion shall hold a senatorial seat.\n\n7. It was permitted to establish own printing institutions of money with an image of one common king.\n\n8. Number of own Armed Forces should be accounted for 60,000 of Cossacks and 10,000 of mercenaries.\n\n9. There were to be restored a big landownership, serfdom and all obligatory duties that existed prior to 1648.\n\n10. To the Cossack Estate were guaranteed the old rights and privileges and up to 100 Cossacks from each regiment on request of the Hetman to be ennobled by the King.\n\n11. On the territory of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia were to be canceled the 1596 Church Union of Brest, announced the freedom of Eastern Orthodox and Catholic religions, to the Easter Orthodox metropolitan bishop and 5 other bishops were granted permanent seats in common Senate of the Rzecz Pospolita.\n\n12. Polish and Lithuanian armed forces had no rights to be on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia except for emergencies and in such case they would be subordinated to the Hetman.\n\n13. Existence of 2 universities: the Kiev Mohyla Academy was to be granted the same rights as the Jagiellonian University of Cracow and a newly created college with status of university.\n\n14. Nationwide it was permitted to establish colleges and gymnasiums with rights to teach in Latin.\n\n15. Freedom of publishing as long as the published materials would not have personal attacks against the King.\n\nHistorian Andrew Wilson has called this \"one of the great 'What-ifs?' of Ukrainian and East European history\", noting that \"\"If it had been successfully implemented, the Commonwealth would finally have become a loose confederation of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians. The missing Ukrainian buffer state would have come into being as the Commonwealth's eastern pillar. Russian expansion might have been checked and Poland spared the agonies of the Partitions or, perhaps just as likely, it might have struggled on longer as the 'Sick man of Europe'\"\" (p. 65).\n\nIn spite of considerable Roman Catholic Clergy opposition, the Treaty of Hadiach was approved by Polish king and parliament (Sejm) on 22 May 1659, but with an amended text. The idea of a Ruthenian Duchy within the Commonwealth was completely abandoned. It was a Commonwealth attempt to regain influence over the Ukrainian territories, lost after the series of Cossack uprisings (like the Khmelnytsky Uprising) and growing influence of Muscovy over the Cossacks (like the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav).\n\nHetman Vyhovsky supported the negotiations with the Commonwealth, especially after he suppressed a revolt led by the colonel of Poltava, Martyn Pushkar, and severed relations with Tsardom of Russia for its violations of the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654. The Treaty of Hadiach was, however, viewed by many Cossacks as 'too little, too late', and they especially opposed the agreement to return land property to the szlachta. After the 1648 revolt, the Commonwealth was very unpopular with ordinary Cossacks. Rank-and-file Cossacks saw Orthodox Moscow as their natural ally and did not care for alliance with the Commonwealth. Furthermore, Hadiach was too much a deal that merely benefited the elite of the Cossacks—the \"starshyna\"—who wanted to be recognized as equal to the Polish nobility. Thus, while some Cossacks, among them the hetman Ivan Vyhovsky supported the Commonwealth, many did not, and Cossack unrest continued in Ukraine. \n\nThe Commonwealth position was further weakened by a string of losses in the Russo-Polish War (1654–67). The Tsar felt threatened by the Treaty of Hadiach, which weakened his hold on Cossacks. The Russians saw the treaty as an act of war, and even before it was ratified sent an army into Ukraine. Although Polish forces under hetman Stefan Czarniecki dealt defeat to Russian forces at the battle of Polonka, and recaptured Wilno in 1660, lack of other Commonwealth military successes, especially in Ukraine, further undermined Cossack support of the Commonwealth. Vyhovsky's early success at the battle of Konotop in June 1659 was not decisive enough, and was followed by a series of defeats. The Russian garrisons in Ukraine continued to hold out; a Zaporozhian attack on the Crimea forced Vyhovsky's Tatar allies to return home, and unrest broke out in the Poltava region. Finally, several pro-Russian colonels rebelled and accused Vyhovsky of \"selling Ukraine out to the Poles.\"\n\nUnable to continue the war, Vyhovsky resigned in October 1659 and retired to Poland. The situation was further complicated by the Ottoman Empire, which tried to gain control of the disputed region and played all factions against each other. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth was weakened by the rokosz of Jerzy Lubomirski. The treaty was mostly repeated in the 1660 Treaty of Cudnów.\n\nIn the end, Russia was victorious, as seen in the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo and the 1686 Eternal Peace. Ukrainian Cossacks fell under the Russian sphere of influence, with much fewer privileges under the Hetmanate than would have been granted under the treaty of Hadiach. By the end of the 18th century, Cossack political influence has been almost completely destroyed by the Russian Empire.\n\nIn the aftermath of the November Uprising in 1831, there was an attempt to recreate the Treaty of Hadiach, to form a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth to throw off the partitions of Poland. It was then that the coat of arms of the proposed Commonwealth was created. The planned convention in Hadiach was declared illegal by the Russians, who stationed close to 2,000 soldiers there to ensure that no meetings or demonstrations take place and blocked passage through nearby bridges. Despite these precautions, a mass and a celebration involving 15–20,000 people and over 200 priests (both Catholic and Orthodox) took place near Hadiach.\n\n\n\n"}

The museum is dedicated to the superheroes sharing the alias of the Flash, with its primary focus on Barry Allen. It first appeared in the 'B' story from \"The Flash\" #154 (August 1965), \"Gangster Masquerade,\" created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino.\n\nThe museum has been destroyed and subsequently rebuilt several times during the careers of both Barry Allen and Wally West. The museum was originally located in Central City, but was relocated to Keystone City after the original was destroyed by Hunter Zolomon. The museum was last destroyed in \"The Flash\" vol. 2, #196 (May 2003), and a rebuilt museum is shown in \"The Flash\" vol. 2, #208 (May 2004). After the death of the fourth Flash (Bart Allen), a statue of him was constructed with a candlelight vigil in his memory being held shortly thereafter. Bart's statue was vandalized and later destroyed by Superman-Prime, who holds a grudge against Bart for his initial defeat during the events of \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nThe museum features various exhibits about the Flash, including his battles and his rogues gallery of foes. The museum also contains a working cosmic treadmill, the device that allows Flash to travel to other dimensions and across time. In addition to the exhibits, the Flash Museum houses a vast storage of various artifacts and weaponry that the Flash has encountered. Depending on the story, some of these weapons are actually part of public exhibits, and are occasionally used during a fight.\nThe museum's curator since its founding is Dexter Myles, a former Shakespearean actor given the job by Barry Allen after his assistance in foiling a robbery. The museum is depicted in \"JLA/Avengers\" #1 (September 2003), and is the site of a battle between the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver against Black Canary, Blue Beetle, and Hawkman to retrieve the Wand of Watoomb, which is won by the Avengers after the Witch uses her chaos magic to knock out the other fighters.\n\nIn \"\", Jay Garrick, Ray Palmer, and Freddy Freeman arrive at a destroyed Flash Museum where technology from the cosmic treadmill was stolen, and three of Jay's friends were killed.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" reality, Flash is not Central City's superhero.

True to form, it is destroyed in the fight between the Flash, Batman, Orion, and several members of the Flash's rogues gallery. A huge statue of the Flash is built in front of the museum. Among the exhibits are Jay Garrick's helmet, the Kid Flash costume, some wax mannequins of Flash's enemies, Turtle Man, Gorilla Grodd, Top and others, one of Captain Boomerang's actual boomerangs, and a globe with a miniature Flash and Superman racing around it to commemorate their race in the \"\" episode \"Speed Demons\".\n\nIn the animated movie \"\", the Flash museum appears attacked by Captain Cold, Top, Captain Boomerang, Heat Wave and Mirror Master.

{"id": "2000149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000149", "title": "Hit and run (baseball)", "text": "Hit and run (baseball)\n\nA hit and run is a high risk, high reward offensive strategy used in baseball. It uses a stolen base attempt to try to place the defending infielders out of position for an attempted base hit.\n\nThe hit and run was introduced to baseball by Ned Hanlon, who was often referred to as \"The Father of Modern Baseball\", at the beginning of the 1894 season of the National League, as part of what came to be called \"inside baseball\". Hanlon was manager of the Baltimore Orioles at the time. His team developed the hit and run along with other tactics during spring training at Macon, Georgia. After its implementation in the season's series opener against the New York Giants, the opposing manager objected to its use; however, it was deemed acceptable. \n\nThe hit and run relies on the positioning of the defensive players in the infield. The first and third basemen normally stand near the foul lines, generally near the inside of their bases, set slightly back to allow more time to react to sharply hit balls. However, if the runner is on first, the first baseman stands closer to the base to prevent steals by means of pick-off attempts by the pitcher; consequently, such positioning produces a bigger gap between second and first basemen. The second baseman and shortstop stand on opposite sides of second base, covering the areas between first and second, and second and third, respectively. Second base itself is not directly covered, as the pitcher can field batted balls in this direction.\n\nIn normal play, if the ball is hit into the infield, one of the players will run toward the ball while another runs toward the base that is no longer covered. For instance, if the ball is hit toward the second baseman, he will run toward the ball while the shortstop runs to cover second base. This allows the fielding player to throw the ball to the player covering the base to attempt a put out.\n\nHowever, during a stolen base attempt, the normal gameplay and positioning is altered. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running toward second, causing the middle infielders to move toward that base in order to tag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This reaction places the infielders out of position for a hit ball, with gaps opening at midway points between first and second and second and third.\n\nThe hit and run takes advantage of this difference by having the baserunner attempt to steal as soon as the pitch is thrown; the batter then attempts to hit the ball into one of the resulting gaps in the infield defense.\n\nThe name \"hit and run\" is therefore a potential misnomer in that the chronological order of the offensive play is \"run and hit,\" with the runner beginning the steal attempt before the batter makes contact, although in a logical sense it is accurate in that the batter's swing occurs while the runner's steal attempt is ongoing, such that any contact (\"hit\") will occur simultaneously with (\"and\") the steal attempt (\"run\").\n\nIdeally, the ball will be hit into a gap and travel into the outfield, allowing the runners plenty of time to reach the bases. Even if the ball is hit toward a fielder's initial position before the fielder has had time to move away from it, however, the fielder may have turned to run toward the base in order to cover the baserunner. In normal play the fielders would face the batter, allowing them to react in any direction, but after they have turned toward the base this becomes much more difficult. Their momentum in this direction adds to this problem.\n\nThe hit and run also has defensive qualities. In normal play the baserunner would start toward second base when the ball was hit. If the defensive players react fast enough, they may be able to throw the ball to second and first before either runner has reached their base, resulting in a double play. In the case of the hit and run, the baserunner has a head start, increasing the baserunner's probability of reaching second base before the ball. This may force the fielders to attempt the out only at first, thereby advancing the runner. It may also allow the runner to advance more bases on a hit than he might otherwise due to that running head start. Although a line drive can easily turn into a double play, line drives are rare so the risk of being doubled off from a line drive is minimal.\n\nThe risk in the hit and run is that, if the batter fails to make contact with the ball, the runner is vulnerable to being thrown out at second base, which the official scorer will record as a caught stealing. The defensive team can improve its odds in this case by using a pitchout, having the pitcher throw the ball far outside the strike zone so the catcher can easily catch it and attempt to pick off the runner.\n\nThe batter may choose to take a swing at a bad pitch to make it harder for the catcher to handle the incoming pitch, or so the ball goes foul (in which case the runner is allowed to return to first, so the attempt protects the runner from being caught stealing). Either way, this can cause the batter to fall behind in the count, making it harder for him to get a hit. And if he does hit a bad pitch he really can't handle, it could result in poor contact leading directly to the batter being put out, so he may end up giving his at-bat away with no advantage to the offense.\n\nThe hit and run has the best chance to be successful when the batter is someone who does not frequently swing and miss, at a time when the count won't disadvantage a hitter if he takes a bad swing, with a runner fast enough to take second base even if the batter does swing and miss.\n\nOften the precise circumstance to call for a hit and run occurs with a two-balls, one-strike count on a hitter, as this situation may meet all of the above criteria, depending on who is at bat and who is on base, but it can occur at other times. An alert defense understands the probability that the offense will call the play at a specific moment, and thus it may choose to call for a pitchout at that moment to defend it. An alert offense, in turn, understands the probability of a forthcoming pitchout, and use the hit and run opportunity as a decoy, causing the pitchout to become another ball in the count in the hitter's favor, increasing his chances of reaching base by walk or hit.\n\nThe hit and run is a very old baseball strategy, dating back to the 19th-century game.\n"}

It provides A-level and BTEC education, and between 2009 and 2012 offered the International Baccalaureate Diploma. It was previously a grammar school for boys. The college has the distinction of being placed consistently in the top 10 sixth form and further education colleges in the country for A-level results, and has won a number of Good Schools Guide awards.\n\nThe college opened in September 1920 as Southport Municipal Secondary School for Boys. New buildings were constructed at the current site on Scarisbrick New Road in 1926, in preparation for a reopening by the Earl of Derby on 16 October of that year, when the institution was rechristened King George V Grammar School. In September 1979 the college assumed its current name; in 1982 its school section ceased to exist.\n\nIn October 2014, Ofsted placed KGV — previously a grade 1 'outstanding' college — in the 'inadequate' or grade 4 boundary for education providers. The report cited a lack of effective leadership and severe staff cuts as reasons for its poor findings. In June of the following year, Ofsted upgraded the college's 'inadequate' grade after a second report announced significant improvement. Since 2014 several of the site's buildings have been refurbished, including the sports hall and the humanities building. During this renovation the two-room Classics building, then the longest-standing building on the campus, was demolished.\n\nThe college no longer uses the house system established when it also served as a secondary school. It previously opted for five subject specific faculties, namely:\n\n\nThe college hosts an independent students' union which is a member of the National Union of Students. The student union is run by the Student Council, which meets at least once a month. Student Council members are typically second-year students elected by members of their tutor groups. The council's two co-chairpersons are elected in a college-wide student election, and are members of KGV's governing body as required by the Education Act 1994.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000158", "title": "South Manchester Synagogue", "text": "South Manchester Synagogue\n\nThe name South Manchester Synagogue refers to both an Orthodox Jewish community in south Manchester, England and to the buildings that it occupies. In 2002, the community relocated from synagogue buildings in the Fallowfield district of Manchester to new premises in Bowdon, Altrincham, Greater Manchester.\n\nSouth Manchester Synagogue was founded in 1872 by a group of people who wished to cater for those Ashkenazi families who lived south of Manchester city centre. In 1913, the congregation moved from premises in Sidney Street, Chorlton on Medlock, to a new building in the then semi-rural location of Wilbraham Road, Fallowfield. This was to be its home for nearly 90 years. \n\nThe Synagogue flourished for many years in its new location, due in no small part to the arrival of successive waves of refugees from Europe in the 1930s. Such was the growth in membership, that an extension had to be built to the women's gallery, and later additional parallel services had to be held in the new Synagogue Hall during the High Holy Days. Membership peaked at over 800 during the 1970s. \n\nThe Synagogue has been blessed with a number of charismatic leaders, including for many years Rabbi Felix Carlebach, Chazan Solomon Morris and more recently Rabbi Yitzchok Rubin. That tradition of vibrant leadership was later continued by Rabbi Dovid Lewis and Chazan Michael Isdale. \n\nThroughout its history, the Synagogue has had to come to terms with demographic trends within the community. In the same way as the move to Fallowfield reflected the move of the membership out of the city centre, so its most recent history reflects the move of many members of the congregation to Hale, Bowdon and the surrounding area.\n\nThe South Manchester Synagogue building in Bowdon is a purpose-built contemporary building. Constraints posed by the compact site necessitated stacking the principal rooms – the galleried Synagogue and a large communal hall – one above the other. Use was made of the sloping site to place the communal hall at lower-ground level and to create a sunken garden with a safe play area for children. \n\nThe main entrance is a glazed foyer with voids reaching down to the lower-ground floor and up to the first-floor entrance to the ladies gallery, admitting daylight into the heart of the building. \n\nThe Synagogue itself is square with the bimah set centrally in a traditional arrangement. The low pitched roof rises to a glazed lantern over the bimah with an exposed steel roof structure that further emphasises the latter's position and importance. The ladies gallery is arranged on three sides of the main space and care has been taken to create a degree of intimacy while still being able to accommodate large numbers for major festivals. \n\nThe windows on each side of the ladies' gallery are fitted with stained glass windows by the Scottish artist John Clark. The windows represent Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and the festivals of Sukkot, Pesach and Shavuot. Further stained glass windows are planned for the main entrance on the theme of the Exodus and for the three-storey atrium on the Shema. The Torah ark and Synagogue interior are all finished in oak to maintain the light, airy ambience of the building. \n\nAlongside the Synagogue at ground level is the library and Beth midrash in which weekday services are held. A retractable wall allows this area to become part of the main worship space, providing additional seating for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. \n\nThe Synagogue was designed to enable access by both able-bodied and disabled people while still conforming to the requirements of Halacha. Sloping ramps provide ease of access to the main entrance and a lift has been installed with special programming for use on Shabbat. A mechitzah has also been installed on the ground floor for women unable to access the ladies' gallery.\n\nThe community's former synagogue building was in Wilbraham Road, Fallowfield. The result of a competition won by Joseph Sunlight, the synagogue was completed in 1913, and is a structure of diverse stylistic influences and innovative technical construction, as recognised in its Grade II listing.\n\nSunlight adopted the style of a Turkish mosque, complete with dome and minaret though interpreted in a modernist, it has even been said cubist, idiom. Sunlight confessed to quoting Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the tower of Westminster Cathedral. The building marked a first in British synagogue construction in avoiding column supports for its 35 ft dome by the use of reinforced concrete in its span and the lattice girders supporting the cantilever gallery. \n\nIn 2003, the Fallowfield building became redundant, the having relocated, and plans were drawn up by a charitable trust to convert it to a residential Jewish student centre. , the building is being renovated, with major changes to the interior. The ladies' gallery has been turned into a complete second floor to replace the function room previously in the annex, which is to be demolished.\n\n"}

{"id": "2000167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000167", "title": "Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)", "text": "Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)\n\nAnglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACS(I)) () is a Methodist school in Singapore. Founded in 1886 by the Rev William Fitzjames Oldham, it was recognised as an IB World School in 2005, and has since consistently ranked among the top 3 schools worldwide that offer the IB Diploma Programme.\n\nACS(I) was also one of the first schools to offer the Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) and is one of two schools, alongside Raffles Institution, to pioneer both the GEP, now SBGE (School Based Gifted Education), and the Integrated Programme. ACS(I) offers the first four years of the Integrated Programme together with their affiliate, Methodist Girls' School, which allows students to proceed directly to ACS(I) (Year 5-6) without taking the GCE 'O' Levels to complete the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program.\n\nThe school's alumni includes 1 Singapore President, 14 full Ministers, 5 Supreme Court Justices, 3 Attorneys-General, the Founding President of Fudan University, and Singapore's only Olympic gold medalist.\n\nACS was offered 'independent' status by Singapore's Ministry of Education in 1987. This was accepted by the ACS Board of Governors. In 1992, the school moved to a new campus at Dover Road. The site was opened by Dr Richard Hu, Minister of Finance of Singapore, on 1 March 1993, the 107th anniversary of the school's founding by Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham.\nACS was founded on 1 March 1886 by Bishop Oldham, as an extension of the Methodist Church. Its first location was a shophouse at 70 Amoy Street with a total of 13 pupils. Its name came from the fact that it conducted lessons in English at night and Chinese in the afternoon. By the following year, enrolment had increased to 104, and the school moved to Coleman Street.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1920, led by the Rev. J.S. Nagle, the school introduced regular religious services and physical education classes. Afternoon classes were also established for academically weaker pupils. In a bid to ensure continuity in school life and keep the school adequately staffed, Nagle encouraged ex-students, known as old boys, to return to the school as teachers. To this day, the Anglo-Chinese School Old Boys' Association is a link through which old boys may keep ties with the school.\n\nThe Anglo-Chinese Continuation School was started by the new principal, the Rev. P.L. Peach, in 1925, for students who had to leave the school due to the newly imposed age limits on school-going boys by the government. Eventually, ACS was renamed the Oldham Methodist School. A secondary school was opened at Cairnhill Road.\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, the Japanese occupied Singapore during World War II. During the Occupation, lessons were suspended, and the school re-opened its doors only in 1946, a year after the Japanese surrender, when the buildings at Cairnhill and Coleman Street were made safe from war damage. The pre-war principal, T.W. Hinch, who had been interned by the Japanese, returned to the school. He set up \"X\" and \"Y\" classes, each with different levels of difficulty, for students who had missed years of their education due to the Occupation. In September 1950, the secondary school moved from Cairnhill to Barker Road.\n\nAlso in 1950, Post School Certificate Classes, later known as Pre-University Classes because they were supposed to prepare students for tertiary education, were set up, and the first batch of girl students was enrolled in ACS. Students in the lower grades continued to be all-male, a practice which persists to this day. Thio Chan Bee, the first Asian principal of ACS, took over in 1952. During his tenure, both the Cairnhill and Barker Road premises were expanded, the latter with the building of the Lee Hall, a three-storey building housing twelve classrooms and four laboratories.\n\nIn 1986, ACS celebrated its centenary with the publication of a hardback history of the school entitled \"Hearts, Hopes and Aims\".\n\nACSP moved out of the Coleman Street campus in 1994; in its place now are the National Archives. In 1988 the Ministry of Education started its Independent School programme. Independent schools are allowed to be privately funded and subject to less government regulation in setting out their curriculum. The school was renamed ACS (Independent); in 1993 the Barker Road campus was vacated and the school moved to Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site was retained for a second secondary school. At the same time, Anglo-Chinese Primary School abandoned Coleman Street (the old building now housing the National Archives of Singapore) to share premises with the new secondary school at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road).\n\nWhen Bishop Oldham started the school in 1886, he also took in some students as boarders. The boarding facility soon expanded and moved into ever-larger premises, first in Bellevue at Oldham Lane, then to Dunearn House at Barker Road. In 1986, when ACS celebrated its centennial year, the boarding school known as Oldham Hall moved into new premises within the ACS Barker Road campus. It moved back into the rebuilt premises in December 2002 and was renamed ACS Oldham Hall to emphasise its roots as a strong and vibrant member of the ACS family.\n\nThe principal of the school is also the school's Chief Executive Officer. The first principal of the independent school was Lawrence Chia, an associate professor of chemistry at the National University of Singapore and a Presbyterian elder. Professor Chia stepped down at the end of 1993 and one of his two vice-principals was selected to replace him. Ong Teck Chin held the post from 1994 to October 2010. From 5 October 2010, Fanny Tan was appointed acting principal in his stead, until the appointment of Winston James Hodge as new principal with effect from 21 June 2011. Then, in December 2018, Arene Koh was appointed as principal.\n\nACS (Independent) was awarded the Singapore Quality Award (SQA) in October 2009. ACS (Independent) has achieved the Singapore Quality Award, all four Best Practice Awards, School Distinction and School Excellence Awards. ACS(I) has won \"The Straits Times\"' 'Top School in Sports (Boys)' award 14 times, starting with the first award in 1996 and winning thereafter every year until 2010, with the exception of 1999.\n\nIt has been consistently ranked as one of the top secondary schools in Singapore. In the GCE 'Ordinary' level examinations, ACS(I) had been ranked in the top 15 institutions in Singapore for a number of years since 1995. In 2008 it was reported that ACS(I) students taking the IB exams for the first time had produced results among the best in the world: nine students had obtained the perfect score of 45, making up almost half the 20 candidates worldwide to do so. It was also reported that ACS(I)'s performance put it among the top three IB schools in the world. In 2010, 27 students worldwide were reported to have achieved the perfect score, of whom 13 came from the ACS(I) November 2009 examination cohort; in 2011, it produced 28 students who earned the perfect score. The number of perfect scorers increased to 29 in 2012 and 37 in 2013. In 2014, the school produced 32 of the 43 students nationwide who obtained perfect scores. In 2015, 34 students scored the perfect score. In 2016, 41 scored the perfect score, accounting for the 48 in Singapore and 81 worldwide to do so. In 2018 ACS scored an average of 41.6 points per IBDP student making it the top IB school in the world as per the league tables published by Education Advisers Ltd at https://www.ib-schools.com/page.asp?t=Global-Top-50 .</ref>\n\nThe school was invited by the Ministry of Education to pioneer an Integrated Programme along with several other schools, targeted at high-achieving students. As these students are expected to attend university, the Ministry decided that it would benefit them to bypass GCE 'O' Level and sit directly for a pre-university examination. Accordingly, in 2004 ACS(I) began its Integrated Programme, adopting the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) to that end. Intakes for the Integrated Programme are at Years 1, 3 and 5.\nACS(I) was also one of the first schools to offer the Gifted Education Programme, and is the only school that offers it alongside the Integrated Programme. From 2012 onwards, students from Methodist Girls' School will move to ACS(I) after their first four years, in year 5 to complete their 6-year IP leading to the IBDP with the ACS(I) batch, without taking the GCE \"O\" levels. Students who cannot cope with either of these may opt for the GCE 'O' Levels instead. The GEP is also offered in ACS(I)'s affiliate, Anglo-Chinese School (Primary).\n\nThe overall programme consists of two main interdisciplinary academic strands; Strand 1 and 2 and other components such as Individualised Study Option (ISO), Philosophy of Disciplines (POD), National Education (NE), Pastoral Care & Career Guidance (PCCG), Physical Education (PE), Co-curricular Activities (CCA) and enrichment options. Strand 1 is focused on mathematics, physical sciences, life sciences, earth sciences, information sciences and technological studies and also contains elements of social sciences. Strand 2 is focused on the languages, language arts and literature, history and social studies and also contains elements of the performing arts in general. The Strand 2 curriculum was adapted from an ACS(I) GEP design. The remaining components include PE/CCA, NE/PCCG programmes and enrichment options designed to develop leadership ability and creativity. Specialised Art and Music electives, National Education, and affective/religious education are also included. Among subjects specially covered for the Integrated Programme in preparation for the year 5-6 IBDP, are Introduction to Human Societies (IHS), Language Arts (LA), and Philosophy of Disciplines (POD). They also have to complete a total of 120 hours of Creativity, Action, Service, and Leadership (CASL) and submit an Individualised Study Option (ISO) which prepares them for the IBDP's Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) and Extended Essay (EE).\n\nYears 3 and 4 utilize the same two-strand system, but with expanded scope and depth. In addition, an annual interdisciplinary colloquium is conducted where experts in different fields and teachers of various disciplines come together to discuss the similarities and differences of their subjects with each other and with the student participants.\n\nYear 5 and 6 utilize the IB Diploma Programme. Diploma students study six subjects from at least five out of six subject groups, concurrently over two years, as well as the core elements of the programme (Theory of Knowledge, the Extended Essay and Creativity, Action, Service). At least three, and not more than four of the six subjects selected are taken at higher level (HL), the others at standard level (SL). HL courses represent 240 teaching hours, and require a greater depth of study across a broader range of content in the subject. SL courses require 150 hours and provide breadth of study across the whole Diploma Programme.\n\nAlong with the default Integrated Programme, ACS offers the Foreign Language Programme, the Malay Special Programme(MSP),the Music Elective Programme (MEP) and the Regional Studies Programme (RSP), the latter two which are offered only by a few selected schools. ACS also offers the Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) (GEP) now known as the School-based Gifted Education (SBGE) for academically brilliant students, among the top 1% in the nation.\n\nIn addition, ACS also offers a specialised subject combination in Years 3 & 4 called the Accelerated Science Programme (ASP).\n\nThe school's stated aim is to have every student be 'A Scholar, an Officer and a Gentleman'. The school motto, 'The Best Is Yet To Be', is taken from the second line of the poem by Robert Browning, Rabbi ben Ezra (1864), and serves to encourage students to achieve greater heights by reminding them that their best achievements are yet to come.\n\nThe Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) formal uniform is worn at all times. For male students, it consists of a white short-sleeved shirt, with either dark blue short trousers (for Year 1 to 3 students) or dark blue long trousers (for Year 4 to 6 male students). The shirt is always tucked in.\n\nMale students in Years 1 to 4 wear a dark blue tie with the ACS logo design on it. Males in Years 5 and 6 wear a striped tie with the school colours to distinguish them from the lower levels. Ties must be worn at all times during school hours. Female students in Year 5 and 6 wear a white short-sleeved shirt, untucked, with dark blue skirts. Yellow school scarves are worn on formal occasions.\n\nThe school's anthem was adapted by teacher Henry Martyn Hoisington in 1926. It is adapted from the Canadian unofficial national anthem \"The Maple Leaf Forever\".\n\nDrawing inspiration from the anthem, Dr Yap Pheng Geck designed the school arms in 1930.\nPlaced in chief azure above the three letters of the school name is a golden creature with a lion's head, an eagle's wings and a dragon's body with claws, representing that the school was founded when Singapore was a British colony, by an American Methodist mission and during the Qing Dynasty in China. Technically, this creature is a heraldic wyvern, however, in a heritage talk to the year ones Vice Principal Patrick Soo has claimed that this is a misconception, referring it to just the 'ACS Creature'. \n\nThe lower part of the field consists of two panels, blue and gold, which represent heaven and earth. The colours also symbolize both spiritual and material accomplishment. The letters \"ACS\" in red symbolize life forming a bridge between both; they also symbolize the blood of Christ uniting heaven and earth. In addition to the school name, the letters ACS are also variously said to spell out Academic achievements, Christian Character, and Sportsmanship or Service beyond self. Finally, the overall shield shape represents the knightly virtues of chivalry, honour, loyalty, valour and manliness.\n\nIn 2001 then-Principal Ong told \"The Straits Times\" that \"we have corporal punishment for some serious offences. But the rules are stated clearly in the school handbook and we have to be consistent in applying them.\"\n\nA publicity document for entry into the school's International Baccalaureate (IB) programme from age 16/17 to age 18/19 says that a punishment for violations of the school's academic honesty policy is \"Caning(only for male students) which will be conducted in the Principal’s office, classroom or during school assembly.\" \"All students who have been caned will be required to attend counselling sessions arranged by the school\".\n\nThe house system is a way of grouping students into mutually competitive groups. It was introduced on 16 April 1929 during the tenure of Principal Thomas W Hinch. ACS Houses were named initially after churchmen Bishop James Thoburn, Bishop William F Oldham, and Rev Goh Hood Keng; and philanthropists Tan Kah Kee and Cheong Koon Seng. In 2005, three other benefactors of the school were honoured by having houses named after them: these were Dr Lee Seng Gee, Dr Shaw Vee Meng and Tan Sri Dr Tan Chin Tuan.\n\nThe houses in chronological order, and their house colours, are:\n\nThe school has over 50 different CCAs, including more than 10 clubs and societies in diverse fields. Participation in 2 CCAs is compulsory for all pupils from Year 1 to 4. Each student participates in 2 CCAs: a Uniformed Group and either Sports, Service, Clubs and Societies or Cultural Activities.\nA notable exception to this 2 CCA policy is for Direct School Admission(DSA) students, who take the DSA CCA as their only CCA.\n\nThe school also offers the usual suite of uniformed groups and a full range of performing arts and sports groups.\nThe OBA was formed by accident rather by design when the Rev J S Nagle, Principal of ACS (1913 – 1922) was tasked with fulfilling Bishop William F Oldham’s vision of building an ACS College. The Rev Nagle contacted the Old Boys, some of whom were distinguished citizens holding prominent positions in society then, to garner their support to realise Bishop Oldham’s dream. Though this dream failed to materialize, the ACSOBA was formed. It was officially formed on 10 July 1914, 28 years after ACS was started at Amoy Street. The OBA provides a venue for the Old Boys to network among themselves as well as organizing events that have since become traditions such as the annual Founder’s Day Dinner. \n\nACS(I) has a number of facilities, including a campus-wide Wi-Fi network, air-conditioned classrooms, computer and science laboratories, multi-purpose halls, auditoriums, lecture theatres. ACS(I) is known for its sporting tradition and has numerous sports facilities, including an artificial turf, a gymnasium, swimming pools and basketball, squash and tennis courts.\n\nThe ACS (Independent) Boarding School houses around 400 students, mostly overseas scholars from the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India.\n\nThe library is named after its financial benefactor, Runme Shaw. It contains over 100,000 books, reference materials and IB syllabus-based course books. The library was extended in 2007.\n\nACS (Independent) has achieved good sporting results through the years, having produced national champions and national sportsmen. It has been strong in swimming, sailing, water-polo and rugby. It has been \"The Straits Times\"' Top School in Sports (Boys) in an almost unbroken streak since this title was first awarded, from 1996 to 2009. The exception was 1999, in which The Chinese High School won the title. The record number of gold medals in a single season was achieved in 2018, where it won 17 gold medals and 10 silver medals. The school has held many winning streaks such as the \"B\" Division Rugby Title from 1997–2003 and the \"C\" Division Rugby Title from 1997–2009. In 2008, ACS (Independent) won a grand slam in Rugby, winning all three \"A\" Division, \"B\" Division and \"C\" Division titles.\n\n\nThe school has also performed well in its uniformed groups, achieving Gold and Best Unit awards multiple times over the past years. In 2011 alone, all of the school's units have attained a Gold award. ACS (Independent) holds the record of having the largest amount of Uniformed Groups in a single school. In addition to this, ACS (Independent) is the only school with a National Cadet Corps Tri-Service, and one of two schools which pioneered the National Police Cadet Corps. The Scout and Venture Scout units of the school are also the largest in Singapore. The Boys' Brigade and Boys' Brigade Primers also encompasses the Boys' Brigade Bagpipe Band, one of only 15 in Singapore. However, the NPCC (Sea) unit and Military Bagpipe Band have since been shut down.\n\n\n\nThe ACS(I) Debate Team has a very strong debating tradition, many of the members going on to represent Singapore at the World Schools Debating Championships. ACS(I) emerged National Champions in 1998, 2005 and 2013 and 1st Runner-Up in both 2004 and 2006 in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships. In 2010, ACS (Independent) emerged champions in the Ministry of Finance Budget Debate for the Secondary School division and 1st Runner-Up for the Pre-University division.\n\nThe school's Young Diplomats' Society has received awards in multiple Model United Nations Conferences both locally and overseas and also organises the annual International Model United Nations Conference.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2012, the school's Philharmonic Orchestra obtained seven consecutive Gold Awards in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival competition, the only youth string ensemble to have done so. The Orchestra achieved two Gold with Honours awards at the 2007 SYF competition, for both its Secondary and College String groups. In 2013, 2015 and 2017, following the festival's award scheme revamp, the orchestra attained the Distinction award, the highest possible honour. It also collaborated with the Singapore Armed Forces Central Band in March 2007, and was the featured orchestra in the 2007 HSBC Young Talents' Concert.\n\nThe Symphonic Band won Gold with Honours awards in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 SYF competitions, being the only school besides St Patricks' School to have achieved this. It was ranked as one of the top three bands in all three years. The band also received a Gold in the 2011 competition. The Wind Ensemble received a Gold in its first year of participation in SYF in 2007, as well as a Bronze in 2009 and a Silver in 2011. In 2006, the band took part in the 17th Australian International Music Festival in Sydney, Australia, attaining a Gold Award. In the Singapore International Band Festival 2008, the band competed against professional bands in the open division and won the only Gold award, it also achieved second place in the Finals. In the SIBF competition for 2010, the band achieved Silver in the Open Category, while in 2012, the Symphonic Band was awarded a Gold in Division II and the Wind Ensemble was awarded Silver in Division I. In 2011, both the Symphonic Band and Wind Ensemble participated in the Senior Category at the Hong Kong Winter Band Festival, attaining Silver and Gold (2nd Placing) respectively. The Symphonic Band has also received Distinction Awards at the 2013 and 2015 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Concert Bands.\n\nThe Choir, established in the 1980s, has taken part in many international and local choral competitions and workshops. The Choir has achieved a Gold award in the 2009 SYF Central Judging, as well as a Gold award in the recent 2011 SYF Central Judging. The Choir also obtained a Gold award at the Genting International Choral Competition in 2007.

The primary purpose of the road is to bypass a densely built commercial strip on Route 9 in the eastern part of Concord. Several times a year, I-393 also serves traffic to events at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon. I-393 runs concurrently with US 4 and US 202 for its entire length.\n\nInterstate 393 begins at I-93's exit 15 interchange, where US 4 East leaves its concurrency with I-93 South and the I-393/US 4/US 202 concurrency begins. The four-lane freeway actually begins a short distance west of I-93 at the north end of Concord's Main Street where US 202 turns east from US 3. From there the road then intersects Commercial Street just before the exit 15 interchange. Just east of the exit 15 cloverleaf is I-393's exit 1 to Fort Eddy Road. This exit provides access to NHTI, Concord's Community College, which is home to the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, an air and space science center. I-393 crosses the Merrimack River and continues east to exit 2, connecting to New Hampshire's State Office Park East and the area known locally as the Concord Heights via East Side Drive (NH 132). Further east is exit 3, I-393's last, to New Hampshire Route 106, which runs south past the commercial area around the Steeplegate Mall, and north to New Hampshire Motor Speedway and the Laconia region. After exit 3, the road turns northward, crossing the Soucook River into Pembroke. Beyond the bridge, I-393 ends and US 4 and US 202 merge down to a single lane before joining NH 9 and continuing eastward.\n\nWhen I-393 was first completed circa 1979, it ended at an at-grade intersection with NH 9 and NH 106 just west of where exit 3 now stands. Exit 3 and the extension beyond were completed in the late 1980s.\n\nA feasibility study conducted in the 1980s proposed a number of alignments that would have extended I-393 beyond its eastern terminus to a new interchange (Exit 10) on the Spaulding Turnpike between Dover and Rochester. This project studied the possibility of creating an east/west highway between Portsmouth and Concord. After much work, it was deemed impossible and an upgrade of U.S. Route 4, a road which closely follows the route of the first NH turnpike from the early 1800s, was studied and completed.\n\nThe intersection of Commercial Street and US 202 used to be a four-way crossing, but in recent years Jersey barriers have been installed and a short bypass under US 202 has been constructed to prevent traffic from crossing the freeway, although the traffic lights remain. The lights on the westbound side have since been modified to become warning lights for the traffic signal at the intersection with US 3.\n"}

Then it assigns to this variable the value that minimizes the number of conflicts. If there is more than one value with a minimum number of conflicts, it chooses one randomly. This process of random variable selection and min-conflict value assignment is iterated until a solution is found or a pre-selected maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nBecause a CSP can be interpreted as a local search problem when all the variables have an assigned value (called a complete state), the min conflicts algorithm can be seen as a repair heuristic that chooses the state with the minimum number of conflicts.\n\n algorithm MIN-CONFLICTS is\n\nAlthough not specified in the algorithm, a good initial assignment can be critical for quickly approaching a solution. Use a greedy algorithm with some level of randomness and allow variable assignment to break constraints when no other assignment will suffice. The randomness helps min-conflicts avoid local minima created by the greedy algorithm's initial assignment. In fact, Constraint Satisfaction Problems that respond best to a min-conflicts solution do well where a greedy algorithm almost solves the problem. Map coloring problems do poorly with Greedy Algorithm as well as Min-Conflicts. Sub areas of the map tend to hold their colors stable and min conflicts cannot hill climb to break out of the local minimum. The function counts the number of constraints violated by a particular object, given that the state of the rest of the assignment is known.\n\nAlthough Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Optimization had known and reasoned about Constraint Satisfaction Problems for many years, it was not until the early 1990s that this process for solving large CSPs had been codified in algorithmic form. Early on, Mark Johnston of the Space Telescope Science Institute looked for a method to schedule astronomical observations on the Hubble Space Telescope. In collaboration with Hans-Martin Adorf of the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility, he created a neural network capable of solving a toy \"n\"-queens problem (for 1024 queens). Steven Minton and Andy Philips analyzed the neural network algorithm and separated it into two phases: (1) an initial assignment using a greedy algorithm and (2) a conflict minimization phases (later to be called \"min-conflicts\"). A paper was written and presented at AAAI-90; Philip Laird provided the mathematical analysis of the algorithm.\n\nSubsequently, Mark Johnston and the STScI staff used min-conflicts to schedule astronomers' observation time on the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nMin-Conflicts solves the \"N\"-Queens Problem by randomly selecting a column from the chess board for queen reassignment. The algorithm searches each potential move for the number of conflicts (number of attacking queens), shown in each square. The algorithm moves the queen to the square with the minimum number of conflicts, breaking ties randomly. Note that the number of conflicts is generated by each new direction that a queen can attack from. If two queens would attack from the same direction (row, or diagonal) then the conflict is only counted once. Also note that if a queen is in a position in which a move would put it in greater conflict than its current position, it does not make a move. It follows that if a queen is in a state of minimum conflict, it does not have to move.\n\nThis algorithm's run time for solving \"N\"-Queens is independent of problem size. This algorithm will even solve the \"million-queens problem\" on average of 50 steps. This discovery and observations led to a great amount of research in 1990 and began research on local search problems and the distinctions between easy and hard problems. \"N\"-Queens is easy for local search because solutions are densely distributed throughout the state space. It is also effective for hard problems. For example, it has been used to schedule observations for the Hubble Space Telescope, reducing the time taken to schedule a week of observations from three weeks to around 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000175", "title": "Apollo Belvedere", "text": "Apollo Belvedere\n\nThe Apollo Belvedere (also called the Pythian Apollo or Apollo of the Belvedere) is a celebrated marble sculpture from Classical Antiquity. \n\nThe \"Apollo\" is now thought to be an original Roman re-creation of Hadrianic date (\"ca.\" 120–140). The distinctively Roman foot-wear is one reason scholars believe it is not a copy of an original Greek statue. It was rediscovered in central Italy in the late 15th century during the Italian Renaissance and was placed on semi-public display in the Vatican Palace in 1511, where it remains. It is now in the \"Cortile del Belvedere\" of the Pio-Clementine Museum of the Vatican Museums complex.\n\nFrom the mid-18th century it was considered the greatest ancient sculpture by ardent neoclassicists, and for centuries it epitomized the ideals of aesthetic perfection for Europeans and westernized parts of the world.\n\nThe Greek god Apollo is depicted as a standing archer having just shot an arrow. Although there is no agreement as to the precise narrative detail being depicted, the conventional view has been that he has just slain the serpent Python, the chthonic serpent guarding Delphi—making the sculpture a \"Pythian Apollo\". Alternatively, it may be the slaying of the giant Tityos, who threatened his mother Leto, or the episode of the Niobids.\n\nThe large white marble sculpture is 2.24 m (7.3 feet) high. Its complex \"contrapposto\" has been much admired, appearing to position the figure both frontally and in profile. The arrow has just left Apollo's bow and the effort impressed on his musculature still lingers. His hair, lightly curled, flows in ringlets down his neck and rises gracefully to the summit of his head, which is encircled with the \"strophium\", a band symbolic of gods and kings. His quiver is suspended across his left shoulder. He is entirely nude except for his sandals and a robe (\"chlamys\") clasped at his right shoulder, turned up on his left arm, and thrown back.\n\nThe lower part of the right arm and the left hand were missing when discovered and were restored by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (1507–1563), a sculptor and pupil of Michelangelo.\n\nBefore its installation in the \"Cortile delle Statue\" of the Belvedere palace in the Vatican, the \"Apollo\"—which seems to have been discovered in 1489 in the present territory of Anzio (at that time territory of Nettuno), or perhaps at Grottaferrata where Giuliano della Rovere was abbot \"in commendam\"—apparently received very little notice from artists. It was, however, sketched twice during the last decade of the 15th century in the book of drawings by a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, now at the Escorial. Though it has always been known to have belonged to Giuliano della Rovere before he became pope, as Julius II, its placement has been confused until as recently as 1986: Cardinal della Rovere, who held the \"titulus\" of San Pietro in Vincoli, stayed away from Rome for the decade during Alexander VI's papacy (1494–1503); in the interim, the \"Apollo\" stood in his garden at SS. Apostoli, Deborah Brown has shown, and not at his titular church, as had been assumed.\n\nOnce it was installed in the Cortile, however, it immediately became famous in artistic circles and a demand for copies of it arose. The Mantuan sculptor Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, called \"L'Antico\", made a careful wax model of it, which he cast in bronze, finely finished and partly gilded, to figure in the Gonzaga collection, and in further copies in a handful of others. Albrecht Dürer reversed the \"Apollo\"'s pose for his Adam in a 1504 engraving of \"Adam and Eve\", suggesting that he saw it in Rome. When L'Antico and Dürer saw it, the Apollo was probably still in the personal collection of della Rovere, who, once he was pope as Julius II, transferred the prize in 1511 to the small sculpture court of the Belvedere, the \"palazzetto\" or summerhouse that was linked to the Vatican Palace by Bramante's large Cortile del Belvedere. It became the \"Apollo of the Cortile del Belvedere\", and the name has remained with it, though the sculpture has long been indoors, in the Museo Pio-Clementino at the Vatican Museums, Rome.\n\nIn addition to Dürer, several major artists during the late Renaissance sketched the \"Apollo\", including Michelangelo, Bandinelli, and Goltzius. In the 1530s it was engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi, whose printed image transmitted the famous pose throughout Europe.\n\nThe \"Apollo\" became one of the world's most celebrated art works when in 1755 it was championed by the German art historian and archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768) as the best example of the perfection of the Greek aesthetic ideal. Its \"noble simplicity and quiet grandeur\", as he described it, became one of the leading lights of neoclassicism and an icon of the Enlightenment. Goethe, Schiller and Byron all endorsed it. The \"Apollo\" was one of the artworks brought to Paris by Napoleon after his 1796 Italian Campaign. From 1798 it formed part of the collection of the Louvre during the First Empire, but was returned after 1815.\n\nThe neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova adapted the work's fluency to his marble \"Perseus\" (Vatican Museums) in 1801. \n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon (1815), the \"Apollo\" was repatriated to the Vatican where it has remained ever since.\n\nThe Romantic movement was not so kind to the \"Apollo\"'s critical reputation. William Hazlitt (1778–1830), one of the great critics of the English language, was not impressed and dismissed it as \"positively bad\". The eminent art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900) wrote of his disappointment with it.\n\nFinally, starting something of a trend among later commentators, the art critic Walter Pater (1839–1894) adverted to the work's homoerotic appeal by way of explaining why it had been so long lionized. Nevertheless, the work retained much popular appeal and casts of it were abundant in European and American public places (especially schools) throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe critical reputation of the \"Apollo\" continued to decline in the 20th century, ultimately to the point of complete neglect. In 1969 a kind of epitaph was provided by the art historian Kenneth Clark (1903–1983): \"...For four hundred years after it was discovered the Apollo was the most admired piece of sculpture in the world. It was Napoleon's greatest boast to have looted it from the Vatican. Now it is completely forgotten except by the guides of coach parties, who have become the only surviving transmitters of traditional culture.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2000183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000183", "title": "Evaluation apprehension model", "text": "Evaluation apprehension model\n\nThe evaluation apprehension theory was proposed by Nickolas B. Cottrell in 1972. He argued that we quickly learn that the social rewards and punishments (for example, in the form of approval and disapproval) that we receive from other people are based on their evaluations of us. On this basis, our arousal may be modulated. In other words, performance will be enhanced or impaired only in the presence of persons who can approve or disapprove of our actions.\n\nFeelings of concern about evaluation nearly always occur when in the presence of others. However, in 1968, Cottrell tried to separate these variables in an experiment. He found that there was no social facilitation effect on three well-learned tasks performed by a participant when there were two other persons (part of the study) blindfolded and supposedly preparing for a perception study. The participants would perform the same as the participants who were to perform the three well-learned tasks alone. Dominant responses (sharper and quicker) were given mainly by participants who had to perform the three tasks in the presence of spectators who seemed interested and who were able to see the participant perform the tasks.\n\nPeople may experience evaluation apprehension when they are part of a negatively stereotyped group and involved in a stereotype-linked activity. For example, women taking a math test may not perform to their full potential because of concerns regarding women's stereotyped difficulties with math. In this situation, evaluation apprehension is called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat can also occur in private, whereas evaluation apprehension cannot.\n\nEvaluation apprehension can affect subjects' behavior in psychological experiments, and can lead to invalid causal inference. Rosenberg defined evaluation apprehension as \"an active, anxiety-toned concern that he [the subject] win a positive evaluation from the experimenter, or at least that he provide no grounds for a negative one.\" As a result, subjects have conformed less in conformity studies and exhibited quicker conditioning in conditioning studies as part of a positive self-presentation.\n\nOther research on evaluation apprehension has shown that, when they must make a choice, subjects are more concerned with presenting themselves in a favorable light (this has been called the apprehensive hypothesis, the \"good subject role\").\n\nConcern with giving a positive self-presentation is also implicit in the social desirability bias. This bias is the tendency to give the \"socially desired response\" (e.g., a response that would typically be considered well-adjusted) in answering items on personality measures. This response set is important for personality researchers because it threatens valid interpretation of test results.\n\nTo study the causal influence of evaluation apprehension in experimental designs, experimenters frequently have to try to manipulate this variable. By creating differing levels of evaluation apprehension, researchers can assess its effect on, and interaction with, other variables, such as self-esteem and manifest anxiety. To heighten participants' evaluation apprehension, experimenters create situations in which participants perceive themselves as being publicly judged. For example, Kim et. al. (2010)'s tested the effect of apprehension on making positive self-evaluations. Specifically, they studied the effect of evaluation apprehension between two groups: people from collectivistic cultures and people from individualistic cultures. To manipulate evaluation apprehension, they raised and lowered the level of evaluation apprehension depending on if participants were alone or with a group of people when they were asked to make positive self-evaluations.\n\nAn indirect manipulation of evaluation apprehension is demonstrated in Leary et. al. (1987)'s study of evaluation apprehension on social-esteem and self-esteem. One's social-esteem is how one is evaluated by others, or at least how one perceives that one is being perceived by others. Until recently, scholars hypothesized that the model of social-esteem directly contrasted the model of self-esteem, one's evaluation of oneself. There is some consensus that social-esteem is influenced by evaluation apprehension given that they are both related to a person's apprehension of being evaluated by others. However, recent research shows that evaluation apprehension can also influence general self-esteem. Leary et. al. conducted an experiment in which participants were told that they would be taking a test that could threaten their ego and that either \"only they, only another individual, both they and the other individual, or no one would see their test score\". By varying the perceived audience, the researchers indirectly manipulated evaluation apprehension. Leary et. al. thus hoped to create conditions that tested the effects of differing levels of evaluation apprehension on social-esteem and self-esteem. Before the test began, the participants were all assessed on their level of evaluation apprehension. The purpose of the study was then to determine how one's evaluation apprehension was affected by a threat to one's self-esteem, social-esteem, both, or neither.\n\nThe results of Leary et. al. (1987)'s study showed a significant increase in evaluation apprehension for participants with both the self-viewing condition and the peer-viewing condition. Participants in the peer-viewing condition were told that they would be evaluated by others; participants in the self-viewing condition were told that they would be evaluated by themselves. This effect was similarly found for the self-viewing and social-viewing condition, but not for the condition in which no one would view the results. These results demonstrate that one may be able to alter evaluation apprehension by manipulating social-esteem and self-esteem.\n\nRecent research has shown that there is a negative correlation between social desirability and manifest anxiety. Studies have demonstrated that evaluation apprehension may moderate this relationship. When evaluation apprehension is lowered, a much smaller relationship between these two variables is found. Therefore, evaluation apprehension is positively correlated to the relationship between social desirability and manifest anxiety. This does not imply that evaluation apprehension is the reason why a person has more anxiety when they have more social desirability. However, this correlation does imply that someone with high desirability is more likely to have manifest anxiety when there is high evaluation apprehension rather than in cases of low evaluation apprehension.\n\nOther studies have revealed that there is a relationship between collectivism and corruption. Recent research has shown that evaluation apprehension may moderate this association. Collectivistic values and one's willingness to act in a corrupted way positively correlate in some studies and negatively correlate in others. Researchers are unsure how to interpret these mixed results. However, Huang et. al. (2015) believed that evaluation apprehension was the third variable that was moderating the relationship. They hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between collectivism and corruption when evaluation apprehension was high because of the fear of being judged for being corrupt by the other people of one's culture. On the other hand, they hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation when evaluation apprehension was low because people would have low fear of judgment from others for being corrupt. Therefore, the researchers conducted an experiment that tested the relationship between collectivism and corruption with the independent variable being evaluation apprehension. All of the conditions in the experiment contained situations where collectivistic values and one's willingness to act corruptly were tested, the conditions only differed in the amount of evaluation apprehension they contained. Numerous experiments were completed by Huang et. al. and the experiment based on bribery scenarios found corroborating results with the experiment based on a bribery game containing real money. Both experiments produced significant results which indicate that collectivism only facilitated corruption when there was low evaluation apprehension. Although this is only one study, the fact that high levels of evaluation apprehension inhibit collectivism facilitating corruption provides further supporting evidence that evaluation apprehension can sometimes act as a moderator.\n\nThe presence of evaluation apprehension can cause some people to act abnormally. Their behavior may be altered from the norm by increasing evaluation apprehension even if the rest of the context remains unchanged. Evaluation apprehension can change behavior both beneficially and detrimentally in laboratory and work settings. Recent research has suggested that at times the true effects of a treatment being tested in an experiment can be influenced by evaluation apprehension. Sometimes, the participants' knowledge that they are in an experiment leads them to experience evaluation apprehension. Their apprehensive feelings of being evaluated results in them acting in a different manner than they would in normal life, thereby leading to false data.\n\nEvaluation apprehension can affect the behavior of people differently depending on their culture and other factors. Research indicates that evaluation apprehension is a primary determinant of individual differences in the ability to make positive self-evaluations among Western and Eastern cultures. Western cultures tend to be more individualistic in nature and therefore the people of those cultures have an easier time making public, positive self-evaluations. The individualistic nature of those cultures encourages people who reside in them to make public, positive self-evaluations because of a lack of social/societal judgment when they do. Eastern cultures, on the other hand, tend to be more collectivistic in nature and therefore the people of those cultures are less likely to make public, positive self-evaluations than they are to make private self-evaluations. This may be due to evaluation apprehension. The collectivistic nature of those cultures discourages praising oneself, so such people are discouraged from public self-praise from fear of being evaluated negatively. Studies have revealed that when these people are in a more private setting where they do not have evaluation apprehension they are more likely to make positive self-evaluations.\n\nAlthough it is commonly believed that evaluation apprehension is largely detrimental, research demonstrates that evaluation apprehension can have both positive and negative effects on social interactions. Evaluation apprehension can be useful at times in spite of its tendency to create anxiety. At high levels, evaluation apprehension can inform people that the situation is important and that they should focus attention on whatever stressor is causing the heightened levels of evaluation apprehension. Research indicates that a person is less easily distracted when they have a heightened level of evaluation apprehension and can therefore be more easily persuaded. Eliminating such distraction creates a higher level of understanding of the presented argument. At the same time, this heightened level of attention can create anxiety. Thus, evaluation apprehension leads to an amplified level of attention that is both beneficial and detrimental.\n\n"}

The land was purchased from Perth Modern School, construction began in 1998, and the building was opened in February 2000. The original 11.2 million raised through the capital campaign was invested in a capital account which earns interest to maintain infrastructure.\n\nChannel 7's Telethon was the biggest single donor to the capital campaign (5 million over 5 years) and in recognition of this, the name was changed to the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research.\n\nIn May 2016 the Telethon Kids Institute held an informational immunisation seminar in Perth. Anti-vaccination activists reportedly hijacked the event, \"abusing researchers and branding them liars\" and forcing the event to close early. An editorial in \"The West Australian\" called it an \"ugly disruption\" and said that \"those who oppose vaccination programs, especially through the use of the tactics displayed on Monday, should examine their consciences\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000208", "title": "Heinrich Ehrler", "text": "Heinrich Ehrler\n\nHeinrich Ehrler (14 September 1917 – 4 April 1945) was a German Luftwaffe military aviator and wing commander during World War II. As a fighter ace, he is credited with 208 enemy aircraft shot down in over 400 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front, with nine claims over the Western Front which included eight in the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.\n\nBorn in Oberbalbach, Ehrler grew up in the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany as one of 12 children in his family. He joined the military service in the Wehrmacht in 1935, initially service with the artillery and anti-aircraft artillery. He participated in the Spanish Civil War and following the outbreak of World War II transferred to the \"Jagdwaffe\" (fighter force). Following flight training, he was posted to the 4. \"Staffel\" of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 77 (JG 77–77th Fighter Wing), and later reassigned to 4. \"Staffel\" of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 5 (JG 5–5th Fighter Wing).\n\nScapegoated for the loss of the German battleship \"Tirpitz\", Ehrler was court-martialled, stripped of his command and sentenced to three years and two months \"\" (honorable imprisonment). Ehrler's sentence was later commuted and his loss of rank rescinded, and in February 1945 he was transferred to \"Jagdgeschwader\" 7 (JG 7–7th Fighter Wing). According to his fellow pilots, Ehrler thereafter flew in the increasingly desperate air battles without the purpose and dedication that had made him one of the Luftwaffes most successful aces. On 4 April 1945, he claimed his last three victories by shooting down two Allied bombers and destroying a third by ramming with his damaged aircraft after having run out of ammunition.\n\nEhrler was born on 14 September 1917 in Oberbalbach, today part of Lauda-Königshofen, in the district of Tauberbischofsheim of the Grand Duchy of Baden. He was one of eight children of a laborer. When his mother died, his father married again. The second marriage added four more children to the family.\n\nFollowing a vocational education as a butcher, Ehrler joined the military service of the Wehrmacht on 29 October 1935. He initially served with the 7th battery of \"Artillerie-Regiment\" 25 (25th artillery regiment) in Ludwigsburg. He then transferred to the Luftwaffe where he served with \"Flak-Regiment\" 8 (8th anti-aircraft artillery regiment) from 7 April to 1 November 1936.\n\nFrom 2 November 1936 to 15 August 1937, Ehrler served with the 3./\"Flakabteilung\" 88 (3rd company of the 88th anti-aircraft department) of the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War. Following this assignment, he then served with the 14./\"Flak-Regiment\" 5 (14th company of the 5th anti-aircraft artillery regiment) from 24 August 1938 to 1 August 1939. He was then posted to 1./\"Reserve-Flakabteilung\" 502 (1st company of the 502nd reserve anti-aircraft battalion) on 2 August 1939.\n\nWorld War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces invaded Poland. Ehrler, who was still serving with the anti-aircraft artillery, requested transfer to the fighter force of the Luftwaffe on 3 January 1940. His transfer request was accepted and he underwent flight training from 1 February to 4 November 1940. During this training period he was promoted to \"Feldwebel\" (staff sergeant) on 1 July and to \"Leutnant\" (second lieutenant) on 1 January 1941.\n\nOn 1 February 1941, Ehrler was posted to 4. \"Staffel\" (4th Squadron) of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 77 (JG 77–77th Fighter Wing), later redesignated to 4. \"Staffel\" of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 5 (JG 5–5th Fighter Wing), based in Norway. There, he scored his first victory in May 1941 and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class () on 19 September 1941. JG 77 supported X. \"Fliegerkorps\" (under \"Luftflotte\" 5) in operations against Britain from bases in Norway, often providing fighter cover for Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber attacks against British shipping. JG 77 was restructured as JG 5 \"Eismeer\" in January 1942.\n\nEhrler claimed his second victory on 19 February 1942. He led a patrol of three aircraft of 4. \"Staffel\" and shot down a Polikarpov I-18. The Allied Convoy PQ 16, consisting of 35 merchant vessels and protected by 15 escort ships, was sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft on 16 May 1942. Over the following days, the convoy came under multiple attacks from \"Kampfgeschwader\" 30 (KG 30–30th Bomber Wing) and \"Kampfgeschwader\" 26 (KG 26–26th Bomber Wing). On 30 May 1942, JG 5 engaged in combat as well. In aerial combat, JG 5 claimed 43 fighter aircraft and 7 bombers shot down. That morning at 09:20, Ehrler, \"Feldwebel\" Rudolf Müller, \"Unteroffizier\" Hans Döbrich and another pilot each claimed a Hawker Hurricane shot down. At the time and in the same area of this encounter, \"Podpolkovnik\" (lieutenant colonel) Boris Safonov, commander 2nd Guards Mixed Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Naval Aviation, was shot down in his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and killed in action. Between 12:35 and 14:00 on 2 June, Ehrler flew on mission providing fighter escort for Junkers Ju 87 attacking Murmansk. On this mission, the Germans encountered Hurricane and P-40 fighters. Ehrler claimed a P-40 destroyed. However, Soviet record only document the loss of two Hurricanes from 2 GvSAP.\n\nEhrler was made \"Staffelkapitän\" (squadron leader) of the 6. \"Staffel\" of JG 5 after the former squadron leader \"Oberleutnant\" Hanns-Diether Hartwein was killed in action on 21 August 1942. Ehrler claimed his 45th and 46th aerial victory on 2 September. On 4 September, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The presentation was made by the \"Fliegerführer Nord\" \"Oberst\" Alexander Holle at Petsamo. On 19 September, on a mission to Murmashi, Ehrler claimed two Hurricanes destroyed, taking his total number of aerial victories to 60.\nIn combat near the Murmansk-Moscow railway on 9 January 1943, Ehrler claimed two Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 and a Hurricane shot down. He was promoted to \"Oberleutnant\" (first lieutenant) on 1 February 1943. In the afternoon of 27 March, II. \"Gruppe\" and III. \"Gruppe\" provided fighter escort for Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s attacking the Soviet airfield at Murmashi. The flight encountered 30 Soviet fighters over Shonguy and Murmashi. In this engagement, the Germans claimed fourteen aerial victories, among them five by Ehrler. Soviet records document the loss of six aircraft. The next day, he was awarded the German Cross in Gold ().\n\nOn 1 May 1943, Ehrler was promoted to \"Hauptmann\" (captain). On 8 June 1943, Ehrler was credited with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 40th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 1 August, Ehrler was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). The presentation was made by Adolf Hitler at the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg. Six other Luftwaffe officers were presented with awards that day by Hitler, \"Hauptmann\" Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld, \"Hauptmann\" Manfred Meurer, \"Oberleutnant\" Theodor Weissenberger, \"Oberleutnant\" Joachim Kirschner, \"Hauptmann\" Werner Schröer were also awarded the Oak Leaves, and \"Major\" Helmut Lent received the Swords to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.\n\nEhrler claimed aerial victories 113 to 115 on 18 August 1943. These were his first claims after the Oak Leaves presentation. Ehrler took off at 14:10 from Pontsalenjoki, heading north where he claimed two P-40 destroyed. During this mission, he lost his wingman \"Feldwebel\" Christian Stolz who was shot down by anti artillery fire. Later that day, Ehrler shot down a Lavochkin La-5 northeast of Loukhi airfield.\n\nOn 1 September 1943, Ehrler was unofficially appointed \"Gruppenkommandeur\" (Group Commander) of III. \"Gruppe\" of JG 5. The position had to be backfilled following \"Major\" Günther Scholz's promotion to \"Geschwaderkommodore\" (Wing Commander) of JG 5 thus succeeding \"Oberstleutnant\" Gotthard Handrick. Ehrler's command of 6. \"Staffel\" was passed on to \"Oberleutnant\" Weissenberg. Ehrler then went on vacation for approximately one month. Following his return, Ehrler claimed his first aerial victory as \"Gruppenkommandeur\" and 116th in total over a P-40 on 24 September. On 25 November, following ten days of relative quiet, the Soviet Air Forces conducted a coordinated attack on Titovka, and the airfields Høybuktmoen at Kirkenes and Luostari near Pechenga. Titovka was attacked by sixteen Ilyushin Il-2 and six P-40, escorted by six Yakovlev Yak-1 and four Yakovlev Yak-9. Høybuktmoen was hit by twelve Petlyakov Pe-2 escorted by twelve Bell P-39 Airacobra and six Yak-9. The Luostari airfield was struck by sixteen Il-2 and six P-40, protected by fourteen Yak-1 and six Hurricanes. That day, Ehrler claimed two P-40s and two Il-2 ground attack aircraft, taking his total to 120 aerial victories.\nIn 1944, III. \"Gruppe\" flew its first mission in force on 29 January. That day, all three \"Staffeln\" took off at 11:40 and encountered a number of Yakovlev Yak-7 fighters from 122 IAD PVO (\"Istrebitel'naya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya Protivo-Vozdushnaya Oborona\"—Fighter Aviation Division of the Home Air Defense) south of Murmashi. During this encounter, III. \"Gruppe\" pilots filed four claims including Ehrler's 121st aerial victory. However, Soviet records only account for the loss of one aircraft. On 13 March, a German convoy left Kirkenes while an inbound convoy was arriving. That day, III. Gruppe was continuously in the air, providing fighter protection for the ships. Ehrler increased his total number of aerial victories to 124 that day after he claimed a P-40 at 13:35 followed by a P-39 and an Il-2 shortly after.\n\nEhrler was credited with nine aerial victories in a 24 hours period on 25/26 May 1944, bringing his tally up to 155. Parts of III. \"Gruppe\" were ordered to relocate from Pechenga to Svartnes at 17:17 on 25 May. At 21:00, 19 Bf 109s under the leadership of Ehrler were scrambled from Svartnes to fend off approximately 80 Soviet aircraft attacking a German convoy. During this encounter III. \"Gruppe\" claimed 33 aerial victories, including twenty \"Boston\" bombers, eight P-40s and five P-39s. However, Soviet records only account for five losses that day. Ehrler claimed four victories in this engagement which took his total to 150 aerial victories. The next day, Ehrler again led 19 Bf 109s from III. \"Gruppe\" in defense of the German convoy. This time the Germans reported combat with approximately 100 Soviet aircraft and claimed 40 aerial victories, among them five by Ehrler. Again, Soviet records do not match this figure, they document the loss of nine aircraft.\n\nOn 30 May 1944, Ehrler unintentionally made a crash landing in Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (\"Werknummer\" 411963—factory number) at Pechenga airfield and sustained minor injuries in the accident. On 1 June 1944, 9. \"Staffel\" was officially detached from III. \"Gruppe\" and subordinated to II. \"Gruppe\" which had left Finland in April 1944 and fought in \"Reichsverteidigung\" (Defense of the Reich). Not every pilot of 9. \"Staffel\" was impacted by this order. Some pilots stayed in Pechenga and formed a newly created \"Kommandostaffel\" (commando squadron), later renamed to \"Eismeerstaffel\" (Arctic Sea squadron).\n\nOn 1 August, Ehrler was appointed \"Geschwaderkommodore\" of JG 5, replacing \"Oberstleutnant\" Scholz who given the position of \"Jagdfliegerführer Norwegen\". In consequence of this decision, \"Oberleutnant\" Franz Dörr was appointed \"Gruppenkommandeur\" of III. \"Gruppe\" and \"Leutnant\" Walter Schuck was given command of 7. \"Staffel\", redesignated to 10. \"Staffel\". On 9 November, Ehrler left his command post at Banak, heading to Bardufoss airfield to get firsthand information about organizational changes and training progress. There, he learned that many pilots were still unfamiliar with the Fw 190; not even the more senior pilots had flown the aircraft. Additionally, he learned that the new pilots lacked combat experience, nor had they been trained in formation flying. Subsequently, Ehrler ordered the 9. \"Staffel\" to train on the Fw 190 while he placed the junior pilots in the \"Kommandostaffel\". To oversee these activities, he postponed his return to 12 November.\n\nOn 12 November 1944 the Royal Air Force (RAF) launched Operation Catechism, the raid which sank the battleship . Avro Lancaster bombers from No. 617 and No. 9 squadrons were sent to Håkøya, a little west of Tromsø, where the \"Tirpitz\" was based. At the time, Ehrler was based at Bardufoss with 12 operational Fw 190 A-3s. Ehrler, who had gone to Bardufoss to assist with training a large influx of inexperienced pilots and helping veterans convert to the Fw 190, did not know the exact location of the battleship and had been told she was based near Tromsø. At no time was the commander informed his unit's sole responsibility was the protection of the ship.\n\nThe command and control center at Bardufoss was informed shortly before 08:00 that three Lancasters had been sighted at 07:39 in the vicinity of Mosjøen heading east. Shortly later, a second bulletin informed that a further Lancaster was sighted heading northeast. The reason for this delay in communication was that the message had been routed from Mosjøen to Fauske and then to the Luftwaffe headquarters at Narvik. The communication officer in charge, \"Leutnant\" Leo Beniers, immediately forwarded this information to Tromsø. At 08:18 the Luftwaffe fighter control center was informed which issued an air alarm for the area of Bodø. At 08:34 further four Lancasters were reported but plotted in the wrong \"Planquadrat\" (PQ—grid reference) of the Luftwaffe grid map (). Due to this error, neither Ehrler nor Dörr were informed of the approaching bombers.\nThat day, Ehrler had preemptively ordered 9. \"Staffel\" of JG 5 at Bardufoss airfield on three-minute readiness while the \"Kommandostaffel\" was still undergoing training and had been placed on 15-minute readiness. Ehrler, who had planned to fly to Alta, entered his command post at 08:50, unaware of the unfolding events. As he was just about to leave the command post, \"Tirpitz\" signaled that they heard aircraft engine noise of unknown origin and altitude, \"Tirpitz\" did not report approaching enemy bombers. At 09:18, Ehrler ordered cockpit readiness for 9. \"Staffel\" and placed the \"Kommandostaffel\" on three-minute readiness. The situation remained unclear for Ehrler until 09:21–09:23 when a second aircraft noise message arrived. He then at 09:23 sounded the alarm and scrambled 9. \"Staffel\". In parallel, Dörr who was alarmed by the fighters taking off, arrived at the command post and took charge of the \"Kommandostaffel\". Ehrler was airborne at 09:25 while takeoff of 9. \"Staffel\" was delayed by five minutes due to a landing Junkers Ju 52. Adding to the confusion, when the British aircraft were detected by the German air defence staff at Tromsø, they asked the airfield command if any fighter aircraft were ready for takeoff. The question was affirmed, but the JG 5 staff thought the enquiry concerned the flight to Alta. The naval officers on board \"Tirpitz\" were notified Erhler was airborne before the British began their attack at 09:38.\n\nEhrler was already airborne when he realized that his radio transmitter was not working. Unable to communicate with his command center nor with the other pilots, he was unsure in what direction to fly. He decided to continue flying to Alta. At 09:30, \"Oberleutnant\" Werner Gayko, the commander of 9. \"Staffel\", finally took off, followed by the other aircraft. At 09:42, Ehrler reached the vicinity of Storsteinnes when he observed to his left a distant mushroom shaped cloud and anti-artillery bursts. He then decided to head towards the smoke before heading west, hoping to cut off the bombers. He searched the coast heading northeast and southwest, and then to Malnes and to the vicinity of Heia before finally flying to Alta. When it finally became clear that the target was the \"Tirpitz\", it was too late for the fighters to intercept, and the \"Tirpitz\" was destroyed with much loss of life. 9. \"Staffel\" also did not find the bombers and returned to Bardufoss airfield.\nAfter this unsuccessful action, Ehrler and Dörr faced a court martial hearing in Oslo on the grounds of not having understood the seriousness of the attack. The allegations included a delay in scrambling the fighters, leaving the squadron and falsely claiming that Ehrler's radio had ceased to operate, preventing him from leading the squadron against the enemy aircraft. Ehrler and Dörr were both made responsible for the loss and tried before the 2nd senate of the \"Reichskriegsgericht\" on 17, 18 and 20 December 1944 under the chair of \"Generalrichter\" Dr. Ernst Reuter. Both were charged with cowardice before the enemy, a charge which had to be dropped. Ehrler was also charged for having abnormal ambition. The court believed that Ehrler abandoned his command post to claim his 200th aerial victory thus disobeying a direct order from the \"Reichsmarschall\" which demanded that such a mission should have been led from the ground. While Dörr was acquitted from all charges, Ehrler was found guilty, relieved of command, demoted and sentenced to three years imprisonment for insubordination. In addition, the court concluded that Ehrler lacks the necessary experience to lead a fighter unit on the Western Front. Ehrler had been recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () prior to the loss of \"Tirpitz\", but the award was not approved.\n\nThe sentence may have been politically motivated. Dönitz was now in the ascendant over Göring, who ultimately court-martialled Ehrler, perhaps to placate the commander-in-chief of the navy. Ehrler's combat record likely saved him from execution. Ehrler was not helped by persistent rumours that he was on unofficial leave with a girlfriend in Oslo as nearly a thousand sailors died.\n\nSchuck, one of his junior officers, appealed to \"Reichskommissar\" Josef Terboven. On 12 January 1945 Terboven hand-delivered Schuck's affidavit in support of Ehrler to \"Reichsmarschall\" Hermann Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. Further investigations and testimonies indicated that the aircrews did not know that the \"Tirpitz\" had been moved to the new location at Håkøya a couple of weeks earlier, and Heinrich Ehrler was a convenient scapegoat for the failure to protect \"Tirpitz\". The investigation concluded the reason for the failure was poor communication between the \"Kriegsmarine\" and the Luftwaffe. Ehrler was exonerated. On 1 March 1945, Hitler officially pardoned Ehrler, the Führer HQ announced his return to front-line service, where he would have the chance to \"rehabilitate himself.\" Ehrler's sentence was commuted and his loss of rank rescinded. He was reassigned to a Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter squadron in Germany.\n\nEhrler was transferred to \"Jagdgeschwader\" 7 (JG 7–7th Fighter Wing) on 27 February 1945 under the command of \"Major\" Weissenberger, his former comrade from JG 5. JG 7 was equipped with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, and was given the task of \"Reichsverteidigung\". During the next five weeks, Ehrler claimed further eight aerial victories while flying with the \"Geschwaderstab\" (headquarters unit) of JG 7. On 21 March 1945, the United States Strategic Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force attacked various Luftwaffe airfields in Germany with approximately 1,300 heavy bombers, escorted by 750 fighter aircraft. That day, Ehrler for the first time flew the Me 262 operationally and claimed the destruction of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. The next day, the Eighth Air Force again targeted various military installations and airfields in Germany. Flying from Parchim airfield, Ehrler claimed another B-17 bomber shot down. On 23 March, the Fifteenth Air Force headed for Ruhland where the Schwarzheide synthetic fuel factory (\"Synthesewerk\" Schwarzheide or \"Hydrierwerk\" Brabag) was based. The bombers came under attack by 14 Me 262s from JG 7 over Chemnitz. In this encounter, Ehrler shot down two B-24 Liberator bombers. The next day, he claimed his fifth aerial victory while flying the Me 262, making him a jet ace. That day, 1,714 bombers, escorted by approximately 1,300 fighter aircraft, targeted 18 Luftwaffe airfields. In the vicinity of Dessau, Ehrler attacked bombers from the 463rd Bombardment Group and 483d Bombardment Group and shot down a B-17. On 31 March, the USAAF Eighth Air Force targeted the oil refineries at Zeitz and Bad Berka, as well as other targets of opportunity. In parallel, the RAF Bomber Command bombed the Blohm+Voss shipyards in Hamburg. In the afternoon, Ehrler claimed a North American P-51 Mustang fighter, escorting B-17s and B-24s to their target areas.\nVarious authors present conflicting information regarding Ehrler's last aerial victories, as well as date and cause of death. Depending on source, his last combat and death occurred on either 4 or 6 April 1945. In one account presented by Forsyth, Ehrler was shot down by a P-51 northeast of Scharlibbe. According to both Boehme and Forsyth, the Luftwaffe combat report signed by Weissenberger and Schuck, a former JG 5 pilot, dates his death on 6 April. In addition, Boehme points out that the report does not reveal the cause of death. On 7 April, a body was recovered near Stendal. An autopsy indicated that it was Ehrler who was then buried at Stendal on 10 April. Forsyth states that the USAAF reported no combat with Me 262s on 6 April. Subsequently, Forsyth speculates that this combat may have taken place on 4 April and that the report is incorrectly labeled. The authors Morgan and Weal, concur with the events presented by Boehme while Heaton, Matthews and Foreman are more inline with Forsyth, stating Ehrler was killed in action on 4 April 1945.\n\nOn 4 April, RAF Bomber Command targeted Nordhausen with 243 Lancaster bombers while the USAAF Eighth Air Force sent 950 B-17s and B-24s to Luftwaffe airfields at Kaltenkirchen, Parchim, Perleberg, Wesendorf, Faßberg, Hoya, Dedelstorf and Eggebek, as well as the U-boat yards at Finkenwerder and shipyards at Kiel. This bomber force was protected by 800 escort fighters. In the Forsyth account, Ehrler claimed his final two aerial victories on this date. On 6 April, the Eighth Air Force attacked Halle, Leipzig and Gera with a force of 641 heavy bombers, escorted by 600 P-51s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters. According to Boehme, Ehrler claimed two B-17s shot down from this attack force before being killed. Alternatively, both authors report that Ehrler may have died while ramming an enemy bomber. According to Ehrler's final received transmission, he radioed \"Theo, I've just used all my ammunition. I'm going to ram. Good bye. See you in Valhalla.\" Schuck who followed the radio transmission exchange over the loudspeaker in the operations room recalls Ehrler's last words slightly differently. He believes they were: \"Theo, Heinrich here. Have just shot down two bombers. No more ammunition. I'm going to ram. Auf Wiedersehen, see you in Valhalla!\"\n\nOn 11 December 2018, the \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", a Swiss, German-language daily newspaper, published an article by the missing in action researcher . According to this article, Benkel, aided by relatives, found remnants of Ehrler's Me 262 and body. A recovery of the remains is planned, an event desperately awaited by Ehrler's brother.\n\nMatthews and Foreman, authors of \"Luftwaffe Aces – Biographies and Victory Claims\", researched the German Federal Archives and state that Ehrler was credited with more than 182 aerial victories. This figure includes at least 173 claims made on the Eastern Front and 9 on the Western Front, including seven four-engined bombers and eight victories with the Me 262 jet fighter. However, the authors indicate that the records for JG 5 are incomplete. They speculate that the actual number of confirmed victories could also be as low as 150 to 175.\n\n\n"}

Castronovo (born August 17, 1964) is an American drummer and singer, best known for being a member of classic rock band Journey and hard rock acts Bad English, Revolution Saints, and The Dead Daisies. He also has been a touring and studio member for Ozzy Osbourne, Steve Vai, Paul Rodgers, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler's GZR, Hardline, and others.\n\nDeen Castronovo was born in the city of Westminster, California and started drumming at the age of 6. He grew up in Keizer, Oregon., where he attended South Salem High School. Deen cites Steve Smith, Neil Peart, Terry Bozzio, Kiss, Rush, Van Halen and AC/DC as musical influences. \n\nCastronovo is the former drummer for bands Wild Dogs, Bad English, Journey and is the current drummer for Revolution Saints and The Dead Daisies.\n\nHe also played on the song \"Smoke of the Revolution\" on the Neal Schon solo album \"Late Nite\" (1989).\n\nWild Dogs is an America rock band from Portland, Oregon formed loosely in 1981 by Jeff Mark, Danny Kurth, Matt McCourt, and Pete Holmes. Drummer Pete Holmes was lured away by Black 'n Blue and was replaced by Jaime St. James. The band had an appearance on a compilation series, but before a full album could be recorded with Shrapnel Records, St. James left the band to also join Black 'n Blue. It was at this point Deen was first discovered by McCourt, who recruited the local, and then only 16-year-old drummer Castronovo to join the band.\n\nDeen played on the self-titled debut album Wild Dogs (1983), the followup Man's Best Friend (1984) and Reign Of Terror (1987). The band was known for its live show, that featured McCourt's props and Castronovo's showmanship.\n\nWhile working with Wild Dogs, Deen met and began working with Tony MacAlpine, which led to an introduction to future long-time collaboration partner, Neal Schon. Shortly after, Neal would invite Deen to audition for a new band with Jonathan Cain, John Waite and Ricky Phillips, which became Bad English. After two albums, which included being nominated for Best New Group in 1989 at the International Rock Awards, Bad English disbanded in 1991. In 1995 a Greatest Hits was released.\n\nAgain working with Neal Schon, Deen played drums and sang backing vocals on Hardline's debut album \"Double Eclipse\". The album's first single \"Takin' Me Down\" peaked at No. 37 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album's second single, a cover of the Danny Spanos song \"Hot Cherie,\" rose to No. 25 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nDeen appeared on the 1995 release \"Ozzmosis\", the seventh solo studio album by Ozzy Osbourne. The album reached number 22 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Deen also toured with Ozzy on a portion of the 1995 leg of the Retirement Sucks Tour.\n\n Deen continued to be in various bands along with Schon, from Hardline to Paul Rodgers. After a 3-year stint with Vasco Rossi, he joined Journey, where he would spend the next 18 years and 5 albums as the drummer, backing and occasional lead vocalist.\n\nWhile not the original drummer for Journey, Deen is the longest-serving drummer to date, having played on the albums \"Arrival\" (2001), \"Red 13\" (2002), \"Generations\" (2005), \"Revelation\" (2008), and \"Eclipse\" (2011).\n\nAs a vocalist, he sang \"Still They Ride\", \"Mother, Father\" and \"Keep On Runnin'\" (and on rare occasions, \"Faithfully\" and \"Where Were You\") in concert in order to let the main lead vocalists take a break. In the studio, he performed lead vocals on \"A Better Life\" and \"Never Too Late\", which were featured on \"Generations\".\n\nCastronovo was fired by Journey in August 2015 following a June 2015 domestic violence arrest. He was replaced by Omar Hakim on the band's 2015 tour, with longtime drummer Steve Smith subsequently rejoining the band.\n\nAfter the Planet Us project did not produce an album, Neal Schon was determined to see the material he had written come to life. At the 2004 annual NAMM Show in Los Angeles, Schon met up with Jeff Scott Soto and tested the waters with a jam session. While in Los Angeles, Schon also attended a showcase featuring Marco Mendoza. Inviting Soto, Mendoza and Deen Castronovo to join him, the new band, Soul SirkUS, began rehearsing and eventually recorded 11 songs for their debut album, World Play. Although all the foundation tracks on the album were originally written for Planet Us, only one completed song from that band was used for Soul SirkUS debut.\n\nIn early 2005, with a completed album titled World Play (the \"black sleeve\" version) the band was ready to tour, but Castronovo fell ill due to extreme exhaustion. Soon after, Castronovo bowed out of Soul SirkUS based on his doctor's recommendation and was replaced by Australian drummer Virgil Donati.\n\nUltimate there were 3 editions of the album. The Black Sleeve version was the original with Deen drumming, the Green Sleeve version was an American edition remastered, the Yellow Sleeve had two versions: a European edition of remaster that included a bonus DVD, and a Japanese edition of the remaster included a bonus track. The Black Sleeve version is the only one with Deen.\n\nWhile still with Journey, Deen, Jack Blades (Night Ranger, Damn Yankees and Shaw Blades), and Doug Aldrich (Whitesnake, Dio, The Dead Daisies) formed Revolution Saints. The band, where Deen served as lead vocalist and handled drumming duties, released its self-titled debut album on February 24, 2015. A follow-up album, Light in the Dark, was released on October 13, 2017. The album was ranked #8 on Dr. Music's 2017 \"Album of the Year\" list.\n\n On November 4, 2017, it was announced that Deen would become the new drummer for The Dead Daisies, replacing Brian Tichy. Deen and the band almost immediately began song writing and hit the studio, again with producer Marti Frederiksen (Aerosmith, Gavin Rossdale, Mötley Crüe, Buckcherry), to record a follow-up to the successful Make Some Noise (2016) album and Live & Louder (2017) release. The new album, \"Burn It Down\" was released April 6, 2018 in multiple formats including: CD, colored vinyl, picture disk vinyl and digital download. The band began a 26-date UK and European tour April 8, 2018 in Glasgow, UK.\n\nJohnny Gioeli and Deen Castronovo first played together on the debut Hardline album, \"Double Eclipse\", which was released in 1992. 25 years later, the two were reunited in Italy to commence work on the debut Gioeli-Castronovo album, \"Set The World On Fire\", available July 13, 2018. Both men have continued on their musical paths since they last saw one another, with Gioeli continuing to lead Hardline as well as being the lead singer of Crush 40 and Axel Rudi Pell's band, while Castronovo spent time with various bands.\n\nDeen's first big gig came at the age of 16 with a band called The Enemy, who opened up for bands like Blue Öyster Cult and Foghat. He has played in Cacophony, Dr. Mastermind, Planet Us (a short-lived supergroup with Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony, Joe Satriani and Neal Schon), Social Distortion, and GZR (formed by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler), as well as in backing bands for Vasco Rossi, Paul Rodgers, and Matthew Ward.\n\nAfter working with Paul Rodgers, he began doing session work with Steve Vai, whom with he made two albums. Steve later called for him to audition for Ozzy Osbourne, which resulted in him recording Ozzmosis and doing a South American Tour with Ozzy. After Ozzy, he began doing session work for producer Michael Beinhorn, recording with Social Distortion, Geezer Butler's solo project and Hole.\n\nHe has released an instructional video entitled \"High Performance Drumming\" in 1991, and has been involved with the Boys & Girls Club of Salem.\n\nIn 2019, he toured with guitarist Neal Schon on the \"Journey Through Time\" tour, which features former members of Journey performing songs from the band's entire discography (including some no longer performed by the official Journey). He acted as the drummer and shares lead vocal duties with keyboardist Gregg Rolie.\n\nIn June 2015, Castronovo was arrested following a domestic altercation. On June 29, 2015, he was indicted by a Marion County grand jury on felony charges of rape, assault, sexual abuse, unlawful use of a dangerous weapon, and contempt of court (the rape charge was later dropped). Castronovo spent 15 days in jail and underwent his fifth stint of drug rehabilitation. Castronovo pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years of probation and counseling for domestic violence; the plea deal provided that he would spend five years in prison if he violated his probation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2000215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000215", "title": "Harvard College v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)", "text": "Harvard College v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)\n\nHarvard College v Canada (Commissioner of Patents) is a leading Supreme Court of Canada case concerning the patentability of higher life forms within the context of the Patent Act. At issue was the patentability of the Harvard oncomouse, a mouse that had its genome genetically altered by a cancer-promoting gene (oncogene). In a 5-4 split, the Supreme Court held that the oncomouse and higher life forms in general are not patentable subject matter in Canada.\n\nHarvard College researchers (the respondents) developed a process by which they could create transgenic animals whose genomes are altered by a cancer-promoting gene (called an activated oncogene). The researchers injected the oncogene into fertilized mouse eggs close to the one-cell stage and implanted them into a female host mouse where they developed to term. The resulting offspring were then tested for the presence or absence of the oncogene. Those with the gene are referred to as \"founder\" mice and are mated with unaltered mice. Offspring that contain the oncogene and have every cell in their body affected (including germ cells and somatic cells) by it are referred to as oncomice. Oncomice are useful for carcinogenic studies as they are more susceptible to carcinogens. Such mice can be given material suspected of being a carcinogen and if tumours develop, it is an indication that the material is carcinogenic.\n\nIn 1985, the President and Fellows of Harvard College applied for a patent for an invention called \"transgenic animals.\" In particular, they applied for a process patent for the process by which they created the mice as well as a product patent for the end product of the process, namely the \"founder\" mice and the oncomice, offspring whose cells are affected by the gene. These patent claims also extend to all non-human mammals whose genomes have been altered in a similar manner. Patent applications on the oncomouse were filed in many countries including the United States, Canada, Europe (through the European Patent Office) and Japan.\n\nIn March 1993, the Patent Examiner rejected the product claims (Claims 1 to 12) on the grounds that higher life forms were outside the definition of \"invention\" in section 2 of the Canadian Patent Act and are therefore not patentable subject matter. The process claims (Claims 13 to 26) were allowed. In August 1995, the Commissioner of Patents and the Patent Appeal Board upheld the refusal to grant a patent for the product claims. This decision was upheld by the Federal Court, Trial Division, but was overturned by a majority of the Federal Court of Appeal. The Commissioner of Patents appeals from that decision.\n\nThe majority of the court reversed the decision of the Federal Court and directed the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent covering claims 1 to 12 of the Patent Application. Speaking for the majority, Rothstein J.A. emphasized the object of the \"Patent Act\", which is to \"promote the development of inventions in a manner that benefits both the inventor and the public.\" He stated that the Commissioner has no discretion to refuse to grant a patent under s.40 of the Act and if a process or product satisfies the requirements of the Act, a patent must be granted. Additionally, the Patent Act does not explicitly exclude living organisms such as non-human mammals from the definition of \"invention.\" The majority concluded that the oncomouse \"must be considered to be the result of both ingenuity and the laws of nature\" and is an invention within the meaning of s.2 of the \"Patent Act\", as it is both unobvious and a new and useful \"composition of matter.\"\n\nIsaac J.A. in dissent, approved of the approach taken by the Patent Examiner and concluded that the Commissioner of Patents must be aware of and take into consideration the public interest. He states that in a morally divisive case such as the one at hand, the court should defer to the Commissioner's decision to refuse to grant a patent.\n\nLeave was granted to the Supreme Court on June 14, 2001.\n\nThe court found in favour of the government, ruling that higher life forms are not patentable. The opinion of the court was written by Bastarache J. with L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, and LeBel JJ. concurring. The sole question before the court was whether the words \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter,\" in the context of the \"Patent Act\", are broad enough to encompass higher life forms such as the oncomouse. The court found that they are not. Bastarache J. stated that the determination of the patentability of higher life forms such as the oncomouse is beyond the authority of the court and would be a massive change in the current patent regime. The majority indicated that as there are significant public policy concerns at play, Parliament is best suited to address this issue.\n\nThough the court believed that the Commissioner went beyond his powers in ruling against a patent on public policy reasons, the court came to the same conclusion in denying the patentability of higher life forms such as the oncomouse. The majority stated that s.40 of the \"Patent Act\" does not give the Commissioner any discretion to refuse to grant a patent on the basis of public policy considerations, echoing Pigeon J.’s statement in Monsanto Co. v. Commissioner of Patents. In terms of the standard of review, the majority believed that the question of whether higher life forms are included in the definition of \"invention\" in the Patent Act is reviewable on a correctness standard.\n\nIn s.2, the \"Patent Act\" defines an \"invention\" as \"any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter.\" The majority concluded that although the definition of \"invention\" is broad, it does not include \"anything under the sun that is made by man.\"\n\nThe majority held that the words \"manufacture\" and \"composition of matter\" are not sufficiently broad to include a higher life form such as the oncomouse. The court is of the opinion that \"manufacture\" denotes \"a non-living mechanistic product or process\" and does not imply a conscious, sentient living creature. The majority determined that the meaning of \"composition of matter\" can be ascertained by reference to the meaning of the words or phrases associated with them and thus is best read as not including higher life forms. The majority also referred to the Oxford English Dictionary definition of \"composition\" which is \"a substance or preparation formed by combination or mixture of various ingredients\" and concluded that the oncomouse cannot be understood in such terms. They also emphasized that higher life forms have unique qualities and characteristics that transcend the particular genetic matter of which they are composed.\n\nMore generally, the court is of the opinion that allowing patents on higher life forms would involve \"a radical departure from the traditional patent regime\" and it is for to Parliament to determine whether higher life forms are patentable.\n\nThe majority determined that the \"Patent Act\", in its current form, is \"ill-equipped to deal appropriately with higher life forms as patentable subject matter\" since biological life forms are living, capable of self-replication, incredibly complex, incapable of full description, and can contain important characteristics having nothing to do with the invention. Justice Bastarache identified some of the serious issues surrounding the patentability of higher life forms including: the agricultural impact on farmers who wish to save and reuse seeds, the rights of the \"innocent bystander,\" who may come into possession of a patented organism by virtue of its ability to self-replicate and thus be subject to an infringement action, deterrence of biomedical research and innovation, and the potential for the commodification of human life, tissues and organs.\n\nThe majority stated that the two central objects of the \"Patent Act\" are \"to advance research and development and to encourage broader economic activity.\" Although those are broad objectives, they determined that Parliament did not leave the definition of \"invention\" open and neither the language nor scheme of the Act suit higher life forms. Thus, they held that Parliament did not intend to extend Patent monopoly rights over inventions related to higher life forms.\n\nThe majority used the fact that Parliament enacted the \"Plant Breeders’ Rights Act\" in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Pioneer Hi-Bred Ltd. v. Commissioner of Patents to bolster their view that Parliament did not believe the Patent Act was tailored to include higher life forms. Bastarache J. stated that since Parliament enacted specialized legislation to deal with the issues surrounding crossbred plants, a subset of higher life forms, had they wished to extend patentability to other higher life forms, they would have likely done so at the time.\n\nIn response to the respondent's argument that drawing a line between lower and higher life forms is indefensible, Justice Bastarache stated that the line is \"defensible on the basis of common sense differences between the two\" and reiterates that a parliamentary response is necessary. Moreover, he stated that the distinction can also be upheld because, unlike higher life forms, a lower life form can more easily be conceptualized as a \"composition of matter\" or \"manufacture\" and microbes can be mass-produced like chemical compounds and will possess uniform properties and characteristics.\n\nA dissent written by Binnie J., with McLachlin C.J., Arbour, and Major JJ. concurring, agreed with the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal and were of the opinion that the engineered oncomouse is an \"extraordinary scientific achievement\" and an inventive \"composition of matter\" within the meaning of s.2 of the Patent Act. Additionally, Binnie J. stated that other jurisdictions with comparable legislation including the United States, Europe, Japan and New Zealand, among others, have held the oncomouse to be patentable.\n\nBinnie J. disagreed with the view of the Commissioner of Patents that at the time the Patent Act was enacted Parliament could not have intended genetically engineered higher life forms to be patentable. He stated that Parliament could not have contemplated many other future inventions including genetically engineered lower life forms, moon rockets, antibiotics, telephones, e-mail or hand-held computers.\" He argued that the Patent Act does not distinguish between higher and lower life forms and such a distinction is an invention of the Patent Office. He stated that efforts to draw the line between patentable lower life forms and \"unpatentable\" higher life forms highlight the arbitrariness of the approach.\n\nJustice Binnie stated that once it is conceded that the genetically altered oncomouse egg meets the criteria for patentability; there is no reason for denying patentability to the resulting oncomouse on the basis that it is not an \"invention\" as defined by the Patent Act. He stressed that s.40 of the Patent Act does not give the Commissioner discretion to refuse a patent on public policy considerations. Additionally, Binnie J. emphasized the fact that Parliament has repealed and avoided including provisions in the Patent Act dealing with the morality of inventions as an indication that these aspects of public policy should be dealt using other regulatory regimes. He identified the Assisted Human Reproduction Act as an example of specialized legislated enacted to deal with public policy considerations similar to the ones at play in this case.\n\nJustice Binnie noted that the outcome of this case takes Canada on a very different trajectory than other countries, including the United States, Japan and Europe. This fact has led some to argue that there is a risk that biotechnology investment will be reduced in the aftermath of the decision.\n\nThe majority's reasoning in drawing the line between higher and lower life forms was called by Dan Burk a \"rationally indefensible distinction.\" He also said that the majority's conclusion that higher but not lower organisms are made of something other than a composition of matter is an \"inexplicable reliance on vitalism\" and \"more properly a matter of religion than a matter of law.\"\n\nWendy Adams has found controversy in the court's belief in ethical neutrality in relation to animal welfare under the Canadian patent system. This idea is based on the idea that patents are fully constituted property rights, providing patentees with a default level of entitlement and would undoubtedly \"skew the utilitarian calculus of animal welfare to the advantage of human animals and to the detriment of non-human animals.\" For that reason, Adams wrote that the ethical review of the treatment of animals should be an additional criterion for patentability. Abraham Drassinower has written that animal welfare issues that may arise in the course of patent applications are based on the fact that animals are considered property and these issues are best dealt with outside the confines of the Patent Act.\n\n"}

Active from 1995 until her death in 2013, she recorded a total of five studio albums. Her debut album, 1996's \"Ten Thousand Angels\", was released on BNA Records and was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA, while 1997's \"If I Don't Stay the Night\" was certified Gold. 1999's \"I'm Not So Tough\", her final album for BNA, was less successful, and she left the label. A self-titled fourth album followed in 2002 on Capitol Records. McCready's fifth and final studio album, \"I'm Still Here\", was released in March 2010 on Iconic Records.\n\nMcCready's first four studio albums yielded twelve singles on the \"Billboard\" country singles charts. This figure includes the 1 hit \"Guys Do It All the Time,\" as well as the Top 10 hits \"Ten Thousand Angels\" and \"A Girl's Gotta Do (What a Girl's Gotta Do).\"\n\nAlthough she had not charted a single since 2002, McCready received significant media coverage regarding her troubled personal life and suicide attempts and her eventual death by suicide.\n\nBorn Malinda Gayle McCready in Fort Myers, Florida, McCready began singing in her local Pentecostal church at age three, and graduated from high school at the age of 16 with the intention of beginning her music career early.\n\nWhen she was 18, she moved to Nashville, where she was signed by BNA Records. Her debut album, \"Ten Thousand Angels,\" was released in 1996 and sold two million copies. The album produced four chart singles on the country charts: the title track at No. 6, followed by her first and only Number One hit, \"Guys Do It All the Time.\" This song, in turn, was succeeded by \"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now,\" a duet with Richie McDonald, then the lead vocalist of Lonestar. The fourth and final single, \"A Girl's Gotta Do (What a Girl's Gotta Do),\" peaked at No. 4.\n\nThe next year, McCready released the album \"If I Don't Stay the Night.\" The album spawned three singles, \"What If I Do,\" \"The Other Side of This Kiss,\" and \"You'll Never Know.\" The album sold 825,000 copies.\n\nIn 1999, McCready released \"I'm Not So Tough.\" The first single, \"All I Want Is Everything,\" failed to break the top 50. The album was a commercial failure, selling 144,000 copies. Soon after, McCready's record company dropped her. McCready was then signed by Capitol Records. She released her self-titled album with Capitol in 2002 to disappointing sales and was dropped by Capitol later that year.\n\nIn May 2008, McCready released the single \"I'm Still Here\" via her official website. She also announced that she had been working on a documentary, a new album, and a reality show. McCready's critically acclaimed fifth album, \"I'm Still Here\", was released in March 2010.\n\nOn February 18, 2013, the day after McCready's death, her final song \"I'll See You Yesterday\" was released.\n\nIn June 2009, McCready signed on to appear on the reality series \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\". The series aired and depicted her struggle with substance addiction. She later discussed her recovery and possible studio work with Todd Gaither on a March 2010 episode of \"The View\".\n\nIn mid-2011, McCready appeared on \"Celebrity Close Calls\" and \"Celebrity Ghost Stories\" series 3 episode 6. She also appeared on the December 9, 2011 episode of \"20/20\", where she discussed her son Zander, her producer boyfriend David Wilson, and new music.\n\nIn 1997, McCready became engaged to actor Dean Cain. The couple broke up the following year. McCready also dated former NHL hockey player Drake Berehowsky.\n\nIn December 2003, she began dating aspiring singer William Patrick \"Billy\" McKnight. On May 8, 2005, McKnight was arrested and charged with attempted murder after beating and choking her. After reporting to \"People\" magazine that she had cut ties with McKnight, McCready was found unconscious in a hotel lobby in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, after attempting suicide in July 2005. She was hospitalized for a drug overdose after consuming a large amount of undisclosed drugs with alcohol. The couple eventually got back together and McCready became pregnant. In September 2005, while she was pregnant with McKnight's child, she attempted suicide again by overdosing on antidepressants. In March 2006, McCready gave birth to a son, Zander Ryan McCready.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, paramedics were called to McCready's Nashville home after an apparent suicide attempt; they transported her to a hospital after finding wounds on her wrists.\n\nIn 2009, she joined the cast of \"Celebrity Rehab 3\" with Dr. Drew Pinsky.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, McCready was hospitalized in Cape Coral, Florida, for a possible drug overdose; she may have had a reaction to Darvocet her mother had given her. She was released later that day and returned home.\n\nA pornographic videotape of McCready and an ex-boyfriend referred to as \"Peter\" went on sale by Vivid Entertainment in 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, McCready gave birth to her second child, a son named Zayne. The child's father, record producer David Wilson, was found dead on January 13, 2013, at McCready's home, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Cleburne County, Arkansas, sheriff's department opened an investigation into Wilson's death. Following Wilson's death, McCready released a statement in which she referred to him as her \"soulmate\" and \"life partner\".\n\nIn April 2008, the \"New York Daily News\" reported on a possible long-term relationship between McCready and baseball star Roger Clemens that began when she was 15. Clemens' attorney Rusty Hardin denied the affair, stating that Clemens would bring a defamation suit regarding this false allegation. Clemens' attorney admitted that a relationship existed but described McCready as a \"close family friend.\" He also stated that McCready had traveled on Clemens' personal jet and that Clemens' wife was aware of the relationship. Clemens issued a statement saying only \"I have made mistakes in my personal life for which I am sorry.\" McCready described the relationship as being sexual in nature.\n\nOn November 17, 2008, McCready spoke in more detail to \"Inside Edition\" about her affair with Clemens. She stated that their relationship lasted for more than a decade, ending when Clemens refused to leave his wife to marry McCready. She was 16 when they first met, she said, adding that the relationship didn't become sexual \"until several years later.\"\n\nIn August 2004, McCready was arrested in Tennessee for using a fake prescription to buy the painkiller OxyContin. Although she initially denied the charge, she pleaded guilty and was fined $4,000, sentenced to three years of probation, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.\n\nIn May 2005, McCready was stopped by Nashville police for speeding, then arrested and charged with driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. A jury later found her not guilty on the charges of DUI, but guilty of driving with a suspended license. That July, she was charged in Arizona with identity theft, unlawful use of transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution. An arrest warrant was issued for her the following month for violation of her probation when she left Tennessee without her probation officer's permission. She was also charged with not reporting to her probation officer during the month of July. She was finally arrested in Florida and returned to Tennessee. She faced a hearing later that year on charges of violating her probation on a drug charge by failing to check in with her probation officer and leaving the state without permission to go to Florida.\n\nIn July 2007, McCready was arrested in her hometown of Fort Myers, Florida and charged with battery and resisting arrest for an apparent scuffle with her mother. The following week, she was taken into custody at the Nashville International Airport for violating probation. In September, McCready was sentenced to a year in jail for violating probation. In addition to the jail time, she was ordered to serve two more years of probation and perform 200 additional hours of community service. She was released from jail in December.\n\nIn June 2008, McCready was arrested in Tennessee for violating the terms of her probation set in September 2007. Sentenced to 60 days in jail, McCready turned herself in on September 30, 2008. After serving half of her sentence, she was released early for good behavior on October 30, 2008.\n\nMcCready was associated with and allegedly victimized by con man Jonathan Roda. The case was featured on television's \"I (Almost) Got Away With It\".\n\nOn February 17, 2013, McCready's neighbors called the Sheriff's Office of Cleburne County, Arkansas, reporting gunshots. McCready was found dead on her front porch from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the same place where David Wilson, her former boyfriend and the father of her younger son, had fatally shot himself one month prior. She was 37 years old. She also fatally shot the pet dog that had belonged to Wilson. McCready is interred at Alva Cemetery in Alva, Florida.\n\n\n"}

It contains more than 2,000 lakes. The district had been elected as one of the 28 finalists of the New 7 Wonders of Nature.\n\nThe Lakeland extends roughly 290 km (180 mi) eastwards from the lower Vistula to the Poland–Russia border, and occupies an area of roughly . Administratively, the Lake District lies within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Small parts of the district lie within the Masovian and Podlaskie Voivodeships.\n\nThe lakes are well connected by rivers and canals, forming an extensive system of waterways. The 18th-century Masurian Canal links this system to the Baltic Sea. The whole area is a prime tourist destination, frequented by boating enthusiasts, canoeists, anglers, hikers, bikers and nature-lovers. It is one of the most famous lake districts in Central Europe and a popular vacation spot, with the highest number of visitors every year.\n\nThe lake district was shaped by glaciers during the Pleistocene ice age. Many of its hills are parts of moraines and many of its lakes are moraine-dammed lakes.\n\nFrom the 13th century on, the Lakeland was successively part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, and the Prussian province of East Prussia. In modern times, while part of the German Empire, it was the location of the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes (1914) and the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes (1915) during World War I. At the end of World War II (1945), following the decision taken at the Potsdam Agreement, all national borders were redrawn, the area annexed by Communist Poland and its German residents expelled.\n\nMother tongue of the inhabitants of Masuria, by county, during the first half of the 19th century:\nThe Masurian Lakeland can be reached by train, bus or car. The nearest international airports are in Szymany, Warsaw, Gdańsk and Vilnius. The main transport hubs in the region are the towns of Olsztyn and Ełk. There are trains to Masuria from Warsaw, Gdańsk and Vilnius, and buses from many Polish cities. A boat service connects some central towns in the region. Biking and boating are popular ways to get around.\n\nHotels can be found in close proximity to the Great Masurian Lakes, in the towns of Giżycko, Mikołajki and Ełk among others. There are also guesthouses and campsites in surrounding villages. The Masuren Waterway starts in Węgorzewo in the north and finishes in Pisz. This Waterway is new for pleasure boats. Only boats with a low waterdraft can go as far as Pisz on the Pisa.\n\nMasuria is famous for its lakes and forests, offering a wide range of outdoor activities from sailing to kayaking and swimming. The region includes the largest lake in Poland, called Śniardwy. The resort towns include the most popular, Giżycko and Mikołajki, Węgorzewo, Ryn, Pisz and Iława. Giżycko is located on the shore of Lake Niegocin. It has an ancient fortress, historic church, bridges, and passenger boats to the towns of Węgorzewo, Mikołajki and Ruciane-Nida. The town of Mikołajki is a popular tourism center.\n\nIn addition to lakes, the Masurian region also has many rivers used for fly fishing, and forest areas that offer many trails for trekking and biking. There is also a variety of wildlife, edible berries and mushrooms, and large protected areas, including the Masurian Landscape Park that includes eleven nature reserves such as the Łuknajno Lake that is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, or the Białowieża Forest, with a breeding station for European Bisons.\n\nThere are four separate boating trails set up along connecting lakes: from Giżycko to Węgorzewo and Ruciane-Nida, and from Mikołajki to Pisz and Ryn. There are also two kayaking trails along rivers, the most popular being the Krutynia River Trail. On top of that, there are several color-marked walking trails with numerous points of interest for qualified tourism. They include:\n\nHistorical sights include the ruins of Hitler's fortified World War II headquarters, the Wolf's Lair, near Kętrzyn (former German name: Rastenburg), which has become a major tourist destination.\n\nMasuria has a temperate climate with cold winters and warm summers. The weather here is generally a bit cooler than in most parts of Poland, and the area usually experiences several snowfalls during the winter. The Masurian lakes are oftentimes frozen from December until the end of February. Springtime can be wet, while summers are generally drier.\n\n\n"}

Pandit (14 June 1918 – 14 March 1993) was a spiritual author, teacher and Sanskrit scholar. For several decades, he was a secretary of the Mother (Mirra Alfassa) of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He wrote numerous books and articles on the yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, on social and political thought, science, philosophy, religion, mysticism, and the classical texts and spiritual traditions of India.\n\nMadhav P. Pandit was born in Sirsi, a small town in Karnataka. His family belonged to the community of the Gowd Saraswats which had migrated from Kashmir to various parts of India. His father was a wealthy and reputed lawyer who engaged himself in manifold social activities.\n\nPandit grew up in a deeply religious Hindu family. When he was still a small child, his mother started taking him every day in the early morning to a temple where he spent his time in devotion and contemplation, which prepared and influenced his later spiritual path. All his life he was to keep some traditional customs such as Pranām.\n\nHis father wanted him to become a lawyer, following the family tradition. Therefore, he sent him to the best schools and additionally arranged for private tutoring in English, Sanskrit, mathematics and sciences. After his immatriculation Pandit continued his studies at Karnatak College in Dharwar.\n\nSundarrao, one of Pandit's brothers, was in close touch with Ganapati Muni, a well-known disciple of Ramana Maharshi, who was an eminent Sanskrit scholar and poet. Even at young age Pandit came to know him as well as his student Kapali Sastry, who was to become Pandit's tutor over time. Sastry was a great scholar of the Vedas and Tantras and taught Sanskrit at a school in Madras. Later on he became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, joining the Sri Aurobindo Ashram where he translated some important texts of Sri Aurobindo into Sanskrit as well as into the South Indian languages Tamil and Telugu. He passed on his manifold knowledge to Pandit, giving him advice and support during his education and on his spiritual path.\n\nOne day, while spending some time in the library of his brother, Pandit by chance discovered an article on Sri Aurobindo and felt spontaneously attracted towards the name and the photo of the freedom fighter and yogi. Subsequently, he started a regular correspondence with Kapali Sastry in Pondicherry and developed increasing interest in spiritual literature. He studied works on Ramakrishna and read the Collected Works of Swami Vivekananda, but eventually turned more and more to Sri Aurobindo and his writings.\n\nIn April 1937 for the first time he travelled to Pondicherry where Kapali Sastry arranged for his meeting with the Mother, which touched him deeply. However, following the advice of his brother, and encouraged by the Mother, he first went to Bombay in order to complete his academic studies with a bachelor's degree in economics. Thereafter, he was free to move to Pondicherry and became a member of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1939, at the age of 21.\n\nHaving joined the Ashram, Pandit concentrated intensively on integral yoga and the work given to him. Over time he developed his literary capacities, translating works of Kapali Sastry from Sanskrit and writing a large number of books on philosophy, yoga, the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother or on Mantra, Tantra, Veda and the Upanishads. He always tried to use a clear, simple language in order to reach many readers. In his title \"Mother and I\" he later on reported on his frequent personal meetings with the Mother as her secretary and on the numerous topics he discussed with her. In his small books \"How do I begin\" and \"How do I proceed\" he presented some concrete hints for the practice of integral yoga.\n\nAfter the Mother had left her body on 17 November 1973, he continued his activities as before, writing his correspondents that her presence and love persisted. In 1976 he started undertaking foreign travel in order to spread Sri Aurobindo's message abroad. Several times he went to the U.S. and to Europe, gave lectures and interviews or organized seminars and conferences. He regularly informed his readers about his manifold experiences in his \"Service Letter\". However, he declined to be regarded as a \"Guru\" and once said in an interview in Florida that this whole ideal was old fashioned now and not any more appropriate. The knowledge that was kept secret formerly, was today freely available, he said, and everyone would be in a position to run his own life and think for himself.\n\nAfter a serious illness, Pandit departed on 14 March 1993 in a clinic in Madras. When the next day his body was kept for public's view at his residence, a large number of friends and admirers came to pay homage to him.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2000243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000243", "title": "Marek Hłasko", "text": "Marek Hłasko\n\nMarek Hłasko (14 January 1934 – 14 June 1969) was a Polish author and screenwriter.\n\nHłasko's biography is highly mythologized, and many of the legends about his life he spread himself. Marek was born in Warsaw, as the only son of Maciej Hłasko and Maria Łucja, née Rosiak. At first he lived with his parents in Złotokłos; later they moved to Warsaw. In the Hłasko family, children were baptised relatively late, hence the writer-to-be was baptized on 26 December 1935 in the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Warsaw. It is said that during the baptism ceremony when asked if he renounces the evil spirits Marek answered \"No\". Later, these words were reported as the evidence of Marek's strong character. \n\nHłasko was three years old when his parents divorced in 1937. Maciej remarried a year later. He died on 13 September 1939, when his only son was five. The war left its stamp on Marek's psyche: later he wrote \"it is obvious to me that I am a product of war times, starvation and terror; it is the reason for the intellectual poverty of my short stories. Simply, I cannot think up a story that does not end in death, catastrophe, suicide or imprisonment. Some people accuse me of pretending to be a strong man. They are wrong.\"\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hłasko's mother was working in the management secretariat of the City Power Station in Warsaw. During the occupation she was fired and ran a food stall till the beginning of the Warsaw uprising. As a result, the family's financial situation worsened. At this time Marek started his education; however, all documents that might provide information about his education were destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. Among the schools that he attended was one near the St. Kazimierz Factory on Tamka Street. During the Warsaw Uprising, Marek stayed with his mother in Warsaw, and when it ended they moved to Częstochowa to the house of a friend. In March 1945, Maria and her son moved to Chorzów and two months later to Białystok, where she settled with Kazimierz Gryczkiewicz. In early 1946, Gryczkiewicz, Maria Hłasko and Marek moved to Wrocław. \n\nIn the summer of 1946, Marek Hłasko joined the Bolesław Chrobry First Wrocław Scout Troops. In order to become a member of the troop, Marek with his family's consent, gave 1933 as the year of his birth. Later he was dismissed from the scouts because of the poor attendance at the meetings. Marek worked as a messenger at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, held in August 1948 in Wrocław.\n\nThe problems connected with Marek's education also cropped up. In his biography of Hłasko, Andrzej Czyżewski writes: \"(Marek) began his education at the age of six and a half. During his school years he was always one of the youngest pupils in the class. To make matters worse, he had a childish appearance. Hence, he could not show off with what a boy in the primary school wants to impress others: strength, dexterity and maturity. He made up for it with the aggression and pertness, even towards his teachers. As a consequence, he had very few school mates. He was always an outsider. He walked away before he managed to make friends and get accustomed to them.\". In June 1948 he graduated from the Maria Konopnicka Elementary School in Wrocław.\n\nFrom September to November 1948, he studied at the Chamber of Commerce’ of the Secondary School of Business and Administration in Wrocław, and from March until June 1949 in the Labour Association of Children Friends’ School in Legnica (at that time he lived in a dormitory). Later, from December 1949 to January 1950, he attended the Technical and Drama High School in Warsaw, yet, in the end of December 1949 and early January 1950, he was expelled for \"a notorious disrespect to school regulations, criminal violations, and wielding a corrupting influence on his colleagues\". \n\nAt the age of 16, he obtained his driving licence and started working as a van driver. On 28 September 1950 he was sentenced by the Magistrates' Court to two months of work with a 10% deduction from his salary (as he violated Article 7, point 2 of the Act on Securing Socialist Discipline of Work). After working off his sentence, he changed his employer.\n\nFrom 15 November 1950 to 1 January 1951, he worked in the Transport Depot in Bystrzyca Kłodzka. Experiences gained there later inspired him to write a novel \"Następny do raju\" (\"Next Stop–Paradise\"). In January 1951 he moved to Warsaw with his mother and step-father. Hłasko often changed his occupation but it was always his own choice. Successively, he worked from 26 February to 15 April 1951 in an Equipment Base of the City's Construction Union, from 27 April 1951 to 16 June 1952 in a subway construction company \"Metrobudowa\", from 4 August to 1 December 1952 in a Transport Association of Warsaw Associations of Consumers, and till 30 March 1953 in a Warsaw Transport Enterprise of the City Retail Sale.\n\nWriting became a chance to get out of this mind-numbing activity. His literary career started in 1951 when he wrote \"Baza Sokołowska\", his first set of short stories. Hłasko became a correspondent for \"Trybuna Ludowa\" (a popular Polish daily) when he was working for \"Metrobudowa\". At the end of 1952 he decided to show extracts of his book to Bohdan Czeszko. His reply letter written on 3 December of the same year included a criticism of Hłasko's literary attempts, but also drew attention to the young author's talent. Moreover, also in 1952, Hłasko followed Stefan Łoś's advice and established contact with the Polish Literary Association and Igor Newerly, who was the protector of young writers. Hłasko introduced himself, to both Czeszko and Newerly, as \"an uneducated driver who tries to describe his life in his free time after work\". \n\nIn April 1953, he received a three-month artistic scholarship from the Polish Literary Association. He gave up his driver's job for good, and went to Wrocław to work on his debut. Moreover, following Bohdan Czeszko's advice, he wrote a story based on his sketches (a final version of Baza Sokołowska) and finished a novel Sonata marymoncka. \n\nHe made his debut with \"Baza Sokołowska\" in \"Sztandar Młodych\" (a daily paper published in Poland in 1950–1997) in 1954. He became quickly known as the most talented writer of the young generation. However, the entering to the literary circle resulted in his alcoholism, which was becoming more and more pronounced. In 1955–1957, he edited a prose section in \"Po Prostu\" (a Polish socio-political magazine published in 1947–57), but he was not a good publicist. In 1956 he finally got his own flat in Warsaw. \n\nHe gained publicity and popularity thanks to his original working style as well as his unconventional behaviour and clothing. He was a legendary figure of the young generation, a symbol of non-conformism. He was well-built; however, the physical appearance concealed over-sensitivity and uncertainty. He was prone to depression and could not adapt to everyday reality. Marek's inclination to rows contrasted with his friends' positive opinions of him.\n\nIn 1958, he went to Paris. The press there called him an Eastern European James Dean, as Hłasko strikingly resembled him. Hłasko really identified himself with this role: he vandalized pubs and restaurants. At this time, he gained worldwide publicity. Nonetheless, he liked the life of a vagrant, so he left Paris and went to Germany and then to Italy.\n\nThe publication of \"Cmentarze\" [The Graveyard], a novel critical of state socialism, in the émigré Polish-language Parisian monthly \"Kultura\", caused a negative press campaign to be launched against him back in Poland. When his request for renewal of his passport was rejected, Hłasko requested political asylum in Western Germany. After three months, he changed his mind and tried to return to Poland. However, while waiting for a response from the Polish government, he decided to visit Israel in 1959. He could not live without Poland but at the same time he could not return to his homeland. As he did not have a talent for languages, he found it difficult to adjust to the reality of life abroad. He led a life of a vagrant, but he did not have to work while his publications provided him with a steady income. He performed manual labour, but he did so out of curiosity rather than need. Since 1960, he had lived in Germany with his wife, German actress Sonja Ziemann.\nIn 1963, he spent a month in prison for his feuds with the police. In 1964 he twice attempted suicide. Between 1963 and 1965, he spent a total of 242 days in psychiatric clinics. In 1965, he divorced his wife, and in 1966, with Roman Polanski's help, he went to Los Angeles. He was supposed to write screenplays, but it did not work out. He had an affair with Betty, the wife of Nicholas Ray, the author of \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and thereby ended his career as a screenwriter. He got a pilot's licence instead.\n\nIn December 1968, during one of his parties, he playfully pushed Krzysztof Komeda off an escarpment. As a result of this accident, Komeda got a brain hematoma and died four months later. Hłasko was to say: \"If Krzysztof dies, I'll go along\" \"(Jeśli Krzysio umrze, to i ja pójdę)\". In 1969, he came back to Germany.\n\nHe died in Wiesbaden at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. One hypothesis is that he mixed alcohol with sedative drugs. However, those who knew him maintain that suicide was out of the question in his case.\n\nIn 1975, his ashes were taken to Poland, and buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. Jan Himilsbach, a writer, actor and stonecutter who worked at the cemetery, was one of the initiators for taking Hłasko's remains back to Poland. Himilsbach carved the inscriptions on Hłasko's grave. The notice was suggested by Hłasko's mother and it says: \"His life was short, and everybody turned their backs on him\".\n\nMarek's private life resembled the life of characters of his works – romantic, tough outsiders, who became symbols of disappointment with realities of the 1950s.\nHumphrey Bogart and Fyodor Dostoevsky were his idols.\nHis prose works voiced his objections to conformity and the hypocrisy of socialist realist literature. He wrote about protest of a moral nature. In his works he depicted the lives of the lower classes as dominated by hopelessness and cynicism. His characters dream about changes which come out to be vain.\nPublishing of his works had been forbidden in Poland for 20 years. He was a co-screenwriter of films such as \"Koniec nocy\" (1957), \"Pętla\" (1957), \"Spotkania\" (1957), \"Ósmy dzień tygodnia\" (1958) and \"Baza ludzi umarłych\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2000245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000245", "title": "Fitchburg Line", "text": "Fitchburg Line\n\nThe Fitchburg Line is a branch of the MBTA Commuter Rail system which runs from Boston's North Station to Wachusett station in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The line is along the tracks of the former Fitchburg Railroad, which was built across northern Massachusetts, United States, in the 1840s. It is one of the MBTA's more scenic commuter rail lines, passing by Walden Pond between Lincoln and Concord. Weekend service includes a specially equipped seasonal \"ski train\" to Wachusett Mountain during the winter.\n\nAt long, the Fitchburg Line is the second-longest line in the system (and was the longest until the Providence/Stoughton Line's 2010 extension to T. F. Green Airport and later to Wickford Junction), and ranks as one of the worst lines in terms of on-time performance. The Fitchburg Line has the oldest infrastructure in the system, and commuter trains must share trackage with freight trains on the outer segment of the line. Only ten of the line's nineteen stations, including both terminals, are fully handicapped accessible - the lowest proportion of any MBTA Commuter Rail line.\n\nA $150 million project completed in 2017 included adding nine miles of double track, an extension to Wachusett, rebuilding two stations, and building a new layover yard.\n\nThe Fitchburg Railroad opened between 1840 and 1845 from Boston to Fitchburg. In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote about his skepticism of the Fitchburg Railroad near Walden Pond in his book \"Walden\". The Boston and Maine Railroad leased the Fitchburg Railroad in 1900 and bought it finally in 1919.\n\nIn 1948, \"The Master Highway Plan for the Boston Metropolitan Area\" proposed the construction of eight radial expressways around Boston connecting to the Inner Belt, Interstate 695. A section of the Northwest Expressway, carrying a concurrency of Route 2 and Route 3, was to run along the Fitchburg right-of-way from Union Square in Somerville to Sherman Street in North Cambridge. This expressway would have taken up some or all of the trackbed, which was then four tracks wide in that section. After successful highway revolts, Governor Francis W. Sargent placed a hold on all highway construction inside Route 128 in 1970. Following a study, Sargent permanently canceled the 1948 plans in 1972, thus also securing the corridor's future for railroad use.\n\nIn January 1958, passenger service on the Fitchburg Division was cut back from the B&M's western terminal in Troy, New York to Williamstown; branch line service to Bellows Falls, Vermont (with connections for Montreal) and Maynard was discontinued that May, while Main Line service was further truncated to Greenfield in December. All service west of Fitchburg was dropped on 23 April 1960.\n\nWhen the newly formed MBTA began subsidizing the Boston & Maine Railroad's intrastate service on January 18, 1965, service was only kept to communities in the MBTA's limited funding district. All service on the Fitchburg Line west of West Concord was cut, as was the low-ridership stop at Riverview; several other northside lines were cut or run at reduced service levels as well. The MBTA scrambled to find funding; subsidy agreements were soon reached with towns along the lines. Service was restored as far as Ayer on June 28, 1965, along with the outer Rockport Branch and full schedules on the Lowell and Ipswich routes.\nAlthough some gains were made, including the reopening of Belmont Center and Waverley stations on March 4, 1974, the system continued to hang on by thin margins. The Central Mass Branch, which shared trackage with the Fitchburg, was cut on November 26, 1971. In December 1973, state subsidies for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, resulting in the MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, refused to pay its $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton also refused $12,300 for its 21 riders. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.\n\nTwo lightly used stops in Waltham – Clematis Brook and Beaver Brook – closed in June 1978.\n\nOn December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought the Boston and Maine Railroad's northside commuter rail assets, including the entire length of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a result of the 1970s energy crisis and especially the 1979 energy crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. Service was restored to Fitchburg and beyond to Gardner on January 13, 1980. Gardner service was ended on January 1, 1987 when Amtrak took over the MBTA contract, due to a dispute between Amtrak and Guilford; the MBTA only owned the trackage to Fitchburg.\n\nIn December 2006, the MBTA began branding certain winter weekend round trips as \"ski trains\". The train used includes a car equipped with ski racks; a shuttle bus to Wachusett Mountain connects at Wachusett station. (Until the 2016-2017 ski season, the bus ran to Fitchburg station instead.)\n\nDue to the cyclic expansion and contraction for the first three decades of the MBTA's existence, the Fitchburg Line was largely neglected and its infrastructure began to decline. The Fitchburg route was once fully double tracked from Boston to Troy, New York; however, the second main was removed in many sections as passenger service declined. By 2000, there was a section of single track between South Acton and Ayer, and a shorter section in Waltham. This limited the number of trains which could continue past South Acton to Fitchburg.\n\nUntil the extension of the Providence leg of the Providence/Stoughton Line to T.F. Green Airport in 2010, the Fitchburg Line was the longest line on the MBTA system; it is now the second longest, and still the longest without full double track.\n\nIn 2000, the Massachusetts State Legislature passed a bill that directed the MBTA to \"conduct a feasibility study regarding the reestablishment of the commuter rail line to the cities of Gardner and Athol on the existing Fitchburg/Gardner/Athol spur line\" as one of many expansion and improvement projects. In 2001, the MBTA began taking public comment for the decadal update to its \"Program for Mass Transportation\". Following response from legislators from communities along the line, the MBTA initiated a study of potential improvements to the line, including not only westward extension but also station improvements and travel time reductions.\nThe 2004 edition of the \"Program for Mass Transportation\" found that restoration of service all the way to Gardner, much less Athol, was deemed impractical for several reasons. Gardner is and Athol by rail from North Station – outside normal commuting distances. The line between Fitchburg and Gardner would cost $104.2 million to double track, and speeds are limited due to the grades going through the Wachusett Mountain range. Because the Route 2 expressway is faster along the corridor than rail service would be, the station at Gardner would have attracted just 50 riders per day. Instead, a 4-mile extension to a previously considered station in West Fitchburg was recommended.\n\nThe \"Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Service Expansion Study\" was released in February 2005, drawing off the PMT conclusions. Recommended short-range improvements included station consolidation, track upgrades, and station improvements; longer-term projects included double-tracking, increased service frequency, and an extension to Wachusett or Gardner. The report priced out $55 million in infrastructure upgrades including double tracking through downtown Waltham and from South Acton to Willows, signal improvements, rebuilding Littleton/Route 495 station, and grade crossing modifications. An extension to Wachusett was to cost $39 million, with Gardner costing an additional $50 million. As an immediate change, the MBTA began running express trains on the line.\n\nThe \"Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Improvement Implementation Plan\", released in September 2005, included a longer list of possible improvements, and outlined a goal of reducing travel time between Porter Square and Fitchburg to one hour. The $300 million list included high-level platforms at all stops from Porter to Littleton, grade crossing eliminations, a flyover at Willows, and stop consolidations. The three Weston stops were to be combined, Ayer and Shirley combined into a Devens station, and Waverley and Belmont stations combined. Few of these expanded alternatives were ultimately pursued.\n\nThe MBTA applied for a federal Small Starts grant in September 2005, and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority filed a scoping package in April 2007 that began the analysis of construction alternatives. The \"Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Improvements Project Alternatives Analysis\" was released in September 2007 and outlined six options: no build with the addition of some continuously welded rail to the line, a $30 million baseline with a new layover facility, and three build options ranging from $150 million to $239 million. Build Alternative 1, costing $150 million, was chosen.\n\nIn November 2007, following the completion of five years of conceptual studies, the MBTA announced $150 million in projects to significantly upgrade the Fitchburg Line. The project focuses on reducing travel times, increasing service frequency, and improving on-time performance. With the addition of several smaller funding sources, the improvements ultimately became a $306 million project with five major components:\n\nThe first work completed was the addition of CPF-43, a new interlocking located at Derby Curve in Leominster. Financed by $10.2 million in ARRA funds, the work was intended to \"provide commuter rail operational flexibility and to minimize conflicts with freight\". CPF-43 includes a universal crossover between the two mainline tracks, plus a new connection to a siding with of space for maintenance-of-way equipment storage and 1000 feet to connect to existing freight customers. Construction work began in October 2009 and finished by the end of 2011.\n\nLocated just off Route 2, the North Leominster station was often crowded for commuter parking spaces. After 5 years of planning, construction began in March 2012 on a three-story garage which provides 340 parking spaces. The $7.7 million project, which was funded by the FTA through earmarks and formula funding, includes a covered busway and charging stations for electric cars. Originally to be completed in August 2013, the garage was delayed due to high summer heat which prevented pouring concrete as well as contractor's financial problems. The garage opened on May 20, 2014.\n\nConstruction of full-length high-level accessible platforms was considered as part of the project, but the platforms would have cost an additional $18 million and created clearance issues with passing Pan Am freight trains. The freight trains, which are slightly wider than standard passenger cars, frequently impact the mini-high platforms and would cause severe damage to full-length platforms.\n\n$43 million ($40 million in ARRA funds and $3 million from the state Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development) provided for the restoration of of double track from Central Street in West Acton to Willows Junction in Ayer. This leaves a short section in Waltham as the only single-track section of the line. Like many of the outer stations on the line, Littleton/Route 495 was built in 1980 with a bare low-level concrete platform (not accessible for handicapped riders) serving a single track. Beginning in early 2012, it was rebuilt with a full-length island platform serving the original track and a new second track.\n\nThe new station opened in June 2013. In August 2014, with the double tracking nearly complete, all South Acton short turns were extended to Littleton. The double tracking work, including 8 grade crossing replacements and a new interlocking just east of Littleton station, was completed in November 2014.\n\nThe largest piece of the project, funded by a total of $172 million in state money and Federal Transit Administration \"Small Starts\" funding, involved incremental improvements to existing infrastructure. Work started in 2012 and was largely completed by the end of 2015.\n\nSouth Acton station is the busiest station on the line, with 902 daily riders by a 2013 count. Like Littleton, it formerly had a single low-level platform. After significant design changes based on community input, construction started on a new station with two full-length high-level side platforms in September 2012. The new station opened on December 21, 2015, with some minor work lasting into June 2016. An additional of double track was installed through the station, filling the gap between the separately funded double tracking to the west and previously existing double track to the east.\n\nPreviously, the section of the line east of Acton had an older signalling system which permitted operations in one direction on each track, which prevented express trains from passing locals and limited schedule density. Fiber optic cable was installed over this segment and new signals installed to permit full bidirectional operation. The double-tracked section west of Willows, which already had bidirectional signalling to permit passenger and slower freight trains to mix, received incremental upgrades. The new signals, along with concurrent track work, allowed maximum speeds on the line to increase from to , with a faster schedule implemented on May 23, 2016.\n\nSeven bridges were replaced or significantly repaired, including one over Route 62 in Concord which was a late addition to the project. Thirteen grade crossings were replaced, nine interlockings built new or improved, and dispatching of some segments transferred from the outdated tower at Waltham to the MBTA's control center. A new freight crossover was added at Ayer, with the East Main Street bridge undercut to increase clearances.\n\nPer the recommendations of the mid-2000s studies, the line was extended west of Fitchburg to a new Wachusett park-and-ride station. The work was funded by a $55 million federal TIGER grant awarded in 2010, plus $19 million in state money. Construction started in mid-2013, and the station opened for limited service on September 30, 2016 to satisfy the terms of the federal grant.\n\nFunded by the same grant was a new layover yard in Westminster, just west of the new station, which replaced a smaller yard in East Fitchburg. The town of Westminster opposed the project due to noise pollution issues, and filed complaints about the MBTA alleging that proper permits had not been obtained and that the agency had misled the town about construction delays. Construction was eventually allowed to proceed; the layover yard opened on November 21, 2016, along with full service to Wachusett station.\n\nWork like laying track, connecting switches, and testing new signals was difficult or impossible to perform during regular daily service. In order to accommodate this work, during 2013 through 2015 service was curtailed on weekends when ridership is significantly lower. Full service was operated during winter months, when snowy weather may make driving a less palatable alternative. In 2013, weekend service was cut back to South Acton from June through August and to Brandeis/Roberts from September to November. In 2014, it was cut back to Brandeis/Roberts from late April to July, and discontinued entirely until November. In 2015, weekend service was discontinued from April 25 to November 22nd except on holiday weekends.\n\nThe MBTA owns all track between Boston and Fitchburg. The line west of the old Stony Brook Railroad (which joins at Willows, east of Ayer) is used by Pan Am Railways as part of their main line between Mattawamkeag, Maine and Mechanicville, New York. Pan Am owns trackage west of Fitchburg, including the section used for the Wachusett extension. Pan Am runs both through freights and Fitchburg-based locals west of Willows; there is no regular freight service on the line east of Willows.\n\nThe Walden Street Cattle Pass crosses beneath the Walden Street bridge in Cambridge, adjacent to the tracks; it was last used in the 1920s.\n\nThe Union Square Branch of the under-construction Green Line Extension will share the right-of-way of the Fitchburg Line from the Inner Belt area to Union Square station. Reconstruction of the Medford Street bridge began in March 2013 as part of initial work; the station is expected to open in 2021.\n\n"}

The premiere was on 22 November 1739 at the Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.\n\nHandel sets a poem which the English poet John Dryden wrote in 1687.\nThe main theme of the text is the Pythagorean theory of \"harmonia mundi\", that music was a central force in the Earth's creation.\n\nEbenezer Prout has commented on various facets of Handel's instrumentation in the work and Edmund Bowles has written on Handel's use of timpani in the work.\n\n\n<poem>TENOR: From harmony, from heavenly harmony\nThis universal frame began.\nWhen nature, underneath a heap\nOf jarring atoms lay,\nAnd could not heave her head.\nThe tuneful Voice, was heard from high,\nArise! Arise!\nArise ye more than dead!\nThen cold, and hot, and moist, and dry,\nIn order to their stations leap!\nAnd music's power obey!\nAnd music's power obey!</poem>\n\n<poem>CHORUS: From harmony, from heavenly harmony,\nThis universal frame began.\nThrough all the compass of the notes it ran,\nThe diapason closing full in man.</poem>\n\n<poem>SOPRANO: What passion cannot music raise, and quell?\nWhen Jubal struck the chorded shell,\nHis listening brethren stood 'round.\nAnd wondering on their faces fell,\nTo worship that celestial sound!\nLess than a god they thought there could not dwell\nWithin the hollow of that shell\nThat spoke so sweetly and so well.\nWhat passion cannot Music raise and quell?</poem>\n\n<poem>TENOR: The trumpet's loud clangour excites us to arms,\nWith shrill notes of anger and mortal alarms,\nThe double-double-double beat,\nOf the thund'ring drum,\nCries hark! Hark! Cries hark the foes come!\nCharge! Charge! Charge! Charge!\n'Tis too late, 'tis too late to retreat!\nCharge 'tis too late, too late to retreat!</poem>\n\n<poem>SOPRANO: The soft complaining flute\nIn dying notes discovers\nThe woes of hopeless lovers,\nWhose dirge is whispered by the warbling lute.</poem>\n\n<poem>TENOR: Sharp violins proclaim,\nTheir jealous pangs,\nAnd desperation!\nFury, frantic indignation!\nDepth of pains, and height of passion,\nFor the fair disdainful dame!</poem>\n\n<poem>SOPRANO: But oh! what art can teach,\nWhat human voice can reach\nThe sacred organ's praise?\nNotes inspiring holy love,\nNotes that wing their heavenly ways\nTo join the choirs above.</poem>\n\n<poem>SOPRANO: Orpheus could lead the savage race,\nAnd trees uprooted left their place\nSequacious of the lyre:\nBut bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher:\nWhen to her Organ vocal breath was given\nAn Angel heard, and straight appeared –\nMistaking Earth for Heaven.</poem>\n\n<poem>SOPRANO: As from the power of sacred lays\nThe spheres began to move,\nAnd sung the great Creator's praise\nTo all the blest above;\nSo when the last and dreadful hour\nThis crumbling pageant shall devour,\nThe trumpet shall be heard on high,\n\nCHORUS: The dead shall live, the living die,\nAnd music shall untune the sky</poem>\n\n\n\n"}

Such mutations can cause a complete lack of production of the associated gene product or a product that does not function properly; in either case, the allele may be considered nonfunctional. A null allele cannot be distinguished from deletion of the entire locus solely from phenotypic observation.\n\nA mutant allele that produces no RNA transcript is called an RNA null (shown by Northern blotting or by DNA sequencing of a deletion allele), and one that produces no protein is called a protein null (shown by Western blotting). A genetic null or amorphic allele has the same phenotype when homozygous as when heterozygous with a deficiency that disrupts the locus in question. A genetic null allele may be both a protein null and an RNA null, but may also express normal levels of a gene product that is nonfunctional due to mutation.\n\nNull alleles can have lethal effects depending on the importance of the mutated gene. For example, mice homozygous for a null allele for insulin die 48 to 72 hours after birth.\n\nA microsatellite null allele is an allele at a microsatellite locus that does not amplify to detectable levels in a polymerase chain reaction test. Microsatellite regions are usually characterized by short, repeated sequences of nucleotides. Primers that are specific to a particular locus are used in PCR amplification to bind to these nucleotide sequence repeats and are used as genetic markers. The primers anneal to either end of the locus and are derived from source organisms in a genomic library. Divergence from the reference sequences (from genetic mutations) results in poor annealing of the primers so that the marker cannot be used, representative of a null allele.\n\nStrong evidence of null alleles was first seen in analysis of bears in 1995. In this analysis, a known parent was determined to be homozygous at a certain locus, but produced offspring that expressed a different \"homozygous\" genotype. This result led to the inference that the parent and offspring were both heterozygous for the locus being studied.\n\nNull alleles or genes have been studied in different organisms from the red pines of Minnesota to \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and mice. Null alleles are difficult to identify because a heterozygous individual for one null allele and one active allele is phenotypically indistinguishable from a homozygous individual with both active alleles. In other words, a null allele can only be identified from the phenotypic standpoint if the individual is homozygous for the null allele. Researchers have been able to work around this problem by using detailed Electrophoresis, gel assays, and chromosomal manipulation.\n\n"}

At , it covers more than half of Niger's land area is the largest Region in the country, as well as the largest African state subdivision. The capital of the department is Agadez.\n\nThe region is a centre for palaeontology, with numerous dinosaur skeletons being found here, including the \"Ouranosaurus nigeriensis\". Cave painting and the remains of ancient human settlements are also located here. Tuareg peoples began migrating to the region from the mid-8th century. From the mid-15th century to the early 20th, much of the region was under the control of the Sultanate of Agadez, except for a period when the area came under the rule of the Songhai Empire in the 1500s.\n\nThe region suffered with the advent of French colonialism as power shifted away to the southwest; Tuareg disaffection with French rule resulted in the Kaocen revolt in 1916-17. This process continued following Niger's independence in 1960; local Tuareg saw little recompense from the uranium mining boom in Arlit in the 1970s, and Agadez Region was struck by repeated draughts and famines. Since then there have been two Tuareg rebellions: from 1990-95 and 2007-09. In recent years the region has also been affected by the actions of Islamist groups.\n\nAgadez Region borders Algeria (Tamanrasset Province and Illizi Province) and Libya (Murzuq District) to the north, Chad to the east, Diffa Region, Zinder Region, Tahoua Region and Maradi Region to the south, and Mali (Kidal Region) to the west. It is by far the largest region of the country, representing 52% of the total area of Niger. The region is dominated by the Sahara desert, and includes the vast Ténéré portion of that desert, as well as dune seas such as the Erg of Bilma. The Aïr Mountains, the tallest peaks in Niger, are also located here. The Djado Plateau is located in the far north.\n\nAgadez is the regional capital; other major settlements include Aderbissinat, Arlit, Assamakka, Bilma, Dirkou, Iferouane, In-Gall, Madama, Séguedine, Tchirozerine, Tegguiada In Tessoum and Timia.\n\nAgadez is divided into three Departments and one Commune.\n\nDespite its size, Agadez is sparsely populated. Its 487,620 inhabitants (as per the 2012 census) account for only 2.8% of the total population of Niger, with a population density of . Much of its population comprises nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples, including Arabs, Fulani, Kanuri, Dazaga Toubou and various Tuareg groups. The Tagdal language and Tasawaq language, thought to be mixed Songhai-Tuareg languages, are also spoken.\n\nTraversed for centuries by the Trans Saharan trade routes, the oasis towns of the Aïr and the eastern Kaouar Cliffs are known for their gardens, salt manufacture, and date cultivation. Arlit is the centre of Niger's uranium industry, a prominent economic sector in the region with uranium pits and mines operated by foreign companies providing substantial revenue for the country. The French discovered Niger's first uranium deposits in the Tim Mersoi Basin of the Agadez Region in 1958 and since then French companies such as Areva have maintained a large footprint in the region, employing a large quantity of locals. Depressed uranium prices since the 1980s have hit the region hard, though uranium remains one of the main foreign exchnage earners for the country. \n\nAgadez had historically been one of the main centres of tourism in Niger, with visitors attracted by the desert scenery, archaeological sites and the Air Mountains. However Tuareg rebellions and activities of Islamist militants in Agadez region have severely reduced the numbers of tourists, with most third party governments advising against travel to the region.\n\n"}
