Smith's bodyguard Graham 'Abo' Henry claimed in \"ABO - A Treacherous Life: The Graham Henry Story\" that the gang of criminals led by Smith committed crimes worth A$25 million in the 1980s.\n\nSmith was born to an Australian mother and an American serviceman father whom he never knew, and he was brought up in Sydney. He attended boys' homes for roughly three years after becoming involved in burglaries and other offences.\n\nSmith has spent much of the rest of his life in prison, serving sentences in 1963 to 1965, 1968 to 1975, 1978 to 1980, and 1989 to now. Smith was a self-confessed heroin dealer, and armed robber, who gained notoriety for his violent temper. Standing tall and weighing in his prime, Smith exploited his size when involved in countless street fights and bar brawls. Journalist John Dale has commented that \"there is no doubting Neddy Smith's physical size and menacing aura\". In \"Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith\", he claimed to have beaten up former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Bunny Johnson after a row outside a Sydney nightclub. However, he denies committing the rape for which he was imprisoned in 1968 and the numerous murders of which he has been accused.\n\nSmith gained further notoriety when he became a whistleblower and star witness for the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Wood Royal Commission. He obtained immunity for all crimes he had committed, except murder in exchange for testifying against former New South Wales Police detective Roger Rogerson and other allegedly-corrupt police officers.\n\nDuring ICAC proceedings, Smith testified that he had committed eight armed robberies and had made a large amount of money from dealing heroin. He alleged that members of New South Wales Police had given him a \"green light\" to commit crimes and had aided him in various robberies and other crimes. He also claimed to have paid corrupt police officers large sums of money to escape criminal charges himself and to assist his friends in avoiding criminal charges.\n\nIn \"The Damage Done\", Warren Fellows claimed he had witnessed Smith make death threats against two police officers, who attempted to take him in for questioning on his daughter's tenth birthday. Fellows also alleges that he was working for Smith when he was arrested in Thailand for attempting to smuggle of heroin back to Australia. Fellows was travelling in the company of Smith's brother-in-law, Paul Hayward, who was also charged with trafficking.\n\nThough Smith has been charged with eight murders, he was convicted only of the murder of brothel owner Harvey Jones and the murder-in-company of a tow-truck driver named Ronnie Flavell during an incident of road rage on 30 October 1987.\n\nAt a Perth coronial inquest in August 2017, it was alleged that Smith was contracted to murder brothel-keeper Shirley Finn in June 1975.\n\nSmith's claimed exploits and those of allegedly-corrupt New South Wales police officers are depicted in the miniseries \"Blue Murder\", based on Smith's book, \"Neddy\", and produced by Australia's public broadcaster, ABC TV. First aired in most of Australia in 1995, the show was banned in New South Wales until 2001 because of the ICAC hearings, the Wood Royal Commission and outstanding contempt of court charges. Australian actor Tony Martin played Smith, and Richard Roxburgh played Rogerson.\n\nIn \"Blue Murder\", Smith is shown murdering whistleblower prostitute Sallie-Anne Huckstepp. Smith was recorded in his prison cell confessing to that crime and later made the same confession to his publisher. However, he has otherwise consistently denied involvement in the murder and has maintained that he knew that he was being secretly recorded in his cell and made the statement to gain publicity for his book. He was subsequently charged with Huckstepp's murder but was acquitted. In his second book, \"Catch and Kill Your Own\", Smith implies ignorance but told writer John Dale that he knows who committed her murder and would release the information once the killer is dead.\n\nDiagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1981, Smith served 14 years in Long Bay Correctional Centre, New South Wales, and was a regular patient at the prison hospital. In 2003, he was moved to Lithgow Correctional Centre.\n\nIn 2008, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that his Parkinson's medication had ceased being effective and that Smith's health had deteriorated, leaving him unable to maintain balance and using a wheelchair. Smith continues to refuse to assist police with ongoing investigations of unsolved murders, which were not covered by the immunity granted to him in exchange for his testimony against allegedly-corrupt police officers at the ICAC and the Wood Royal Commission hearings.\n\nIn April 2017, Smith attempted to escape custody while being treated for heart problems at the Prince of Wales Hospital, in Randwick, New South Wales He allegedly sneaked past two prison guards, only to be caught by nurses in the corridor.\n\n"}

The characters portrayed in this game are individuals able to bend or break the commonly accepted rules of reality to perform subtle or outlandish acts of magic. These characters are broadly referred to as \"mages\". \"Mage: The Awakening\" won the 2006 ENnie Award.\n\nWhile it is loosely based on a prior White Wolf product, \"\", differences in the setting themes and core concepts have led critics to question whether it is appropriate to call \"Awakening\" a successor to \"Ascension\" or a completely different game.\n\nAs with the other games in the Chronicles of Darkness, the history presented in the game provides for some ambiguity. However, the \"origin story\" of magic and mages is less ambiguous (or at least given more lip-service) than that of or .\n\nIn the mythic past, a mysterious island existed with a single towering mountain, encircled by dragons that lived upon its summit. The mountain called to humanity through dreams and visions. Over time, the dragons left and the mountain continued to call. Some humans answered the call and sought it out. The humans who moved there discovered the first secrets of magic, and through magic they created the mighty city-state now known as Atlantis, Meru, Lemuria, etc. though its true name has been lost to time.\n\nOver time, the mages became filled with hubris, and began fighting over how it is best to lead the world. The battle separated the Earth into the Fallen World and the Supernal Realm, with the chasm of the Abyss in between. The Fallen World is the world where humanity now exists, and the Supernal realm is the realm of magic, where the victorious mages of long ago now reside. The Abyss that separates the two worlds prevents most of humanity from awakening to magic, and hampers the power of mages trapped in the Fallen World.\n\nMages believe that the Supernal Realm is the truth of reality and the origin of magic. It is ruled by the Exarchs, powerful mages who have established themselves as its rulers. The Exarchs wish to snuff out the memory of \"Atlantis\" and knowledge of magic so that they will remain the supreme masters of reality. They are more godlike forces than human beings now, however this means that they must influence the Fallen World through servants.\n\nResistance against the Exarchs is possible because of the Oracles, a small number (probably five) of Atlantean mages who also reached the Supernal Realm. They each created (or maybe are) one of the Watchtowers, which are locations in the Supernal Realms that can cut through the Abyss. They serve as paths towards magic, allowing Sleepers (humans unaware of magic) to awaken to it. Each mage visits a Watchtower during their Awakening—through means perhaps accidental, or perhaps resulting from a person's nature or understanding—and their magical abilities are forever affected by that journey.\n\nFragments of the organizations, artifacts and writings from the First City survive to the present day, and mages hope to use this knowledge to further their various causes, by gaining a stronger connection to the Supernal Realm.\n\nThe process of awakening can be slow or fast, but there are two major ways in which the event may manifest: the Mystery Play (in which the mage's senses blur the real world and the magical symbolism of their awakening) and the Astral Journey (which takes place entirely within a dreamscape of the prospective mage). In both sorts of \"awakenings\", the mage-to-be goes on a journey that culminates with them arriving at or in their respective Tower and inscribing their name upon it.\n\nThere are five Paths of Magic that have a sympathetic connection to one of the Five Watchtowers, each with a particular style and focus. A Mage's Path is decided with his or her awakening.\n\n\nAfter awakening, a mage typically joins one of the five Orders, although some choose to remain free of political connections, or remain outside of mage society due to ignorance, and are called apostates. The Five Orders are united in their opposition to the Exarchs, and four claim a heritage going back to the First City.\n\n\nThe Orders have competing agendas and opposing beliefs, leading to a lack of cooperation and trust, however this does not lead to open warfare between the Orders. When enemies of the Orders, such as the Seers of the Throne, appear, the Orders put aside their differences, as their squabbles are petty compared to the battle between the Oracles and the Exarchs.\n\nLegacies are an optional third grouping, literally portrayed as refinements of one's soul that are passed on from master to student. These grant additional innate benefits, including abilities and gifts called Attainments, which are exempt from the usual Paradox. Certain Legacies exist—which might practice unwholesome arts such as necromancy or infernalism, or perhaps simply espouse political views that are unpopular amongst local mages—known as Left-Handed Legacies. They are largely meant as antagonists rather than player characters. Many who practice these have a low Wisdom score, representing a progressive moral decline that comes from practicing them.\n\nMagic is simply the ability of a mage (or \"willworker\") to impose their will onto reality. Mages are able to do this because of their sympathetic connection to the Watchtowers in the Supernal Realms, because their names are inscribed upon it, and because they realize the Fallen World is a lie.\n\nA mage's power, or level of awakening and understanding of the depths of the Supernal, is called Gnosis.\n\nArcana represent the understanding a mage has over particular facets of reality, and govern their ability to affect those aspects. Subtle Arcana (Death, Fate, Mind, Prime, and Spirit) are those that deal with the more ephemeral matters of existence, while Gross Arcana (Forces, Life, Matter, Space, and Time) are those relating to the physical aspects of the world.\n\nCovert spells are those that do not outwardly appear magical, and therefore do not automatically risk backfiring (called Paradox), while Vulgar spells are unmistakably magical, and risk backfiring. All spells have a greater risk of Paradox when they are cast in the presence of Sleepers, or non-Awakened humans. Supernatural beings, or humans that have some hint of the supernatural about them (i.e. Ghouls, Sleepwalkers, and Wolfblooded) do not contribute to Paradox.\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Storytelling Adventure System\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nResidents of the town of Barugo are traditionally referred to as \"Barugonon\" but often incorrectly referred to as \"Barugueños\".\n\nBarugo is a town in the northern coastal part of Leyte facing Carigara Bay, north-west of Tacloban City, whose history dates back to the early days of Spanish colonization. It remains an agricultural town producing rice, corn and copra. Residents of a few coastal barangays are engaged in small-scale fishing and aquaculture. Its cottage industries are the manufacture of \"tuba\" (coconut palm wine) and \"roscas\" (sweet pastries made of flour, sugar, eggs and shortening). Not unlike the rest of the country, its economy is partly driven by dollar remittances from overseas workers.\n\nBarugo is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\n\nEarly during the Spanish rule, the area was given the status of a \"pueblo\" (town) when it was established as an \"\"encomienda\".\" An encomienda was a land estate awarded to deserving Spaniards for services rendered to the Spanish Crown. The grantee of an encomienda, known as encomiendero, was given the right to rule the encomienda in accordance with the Spanish laws and to extract tributes from the natives, part of which went to the Spanish Crown.\n\nMiguel Lopez de Legaspi, the first governor of the Islas Pilipinas, started the practice of designating large landed estates as encomiendas. Only ten months after Cebu and Manila became encomiendas, Barugo was also designated as one on November 3, 1571. Rodrigo de Vargas was the first encomiendero for Barugo.\n\nThe education of the natives in Leyte started with the arrival of the Jesuits on July 16, 1595. The mission schools in the beginning concentrated on the basics of Christianity. Barugo initially was only a \"\"visita\"\" of Carigara, meaning that it was under the administrative and spiritual supervision of the curate of Carigara, and was under the care of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, who eventually became its first parish priest after Barugo was declared as an independent parish. It was Fr. Sanchez who established the first church in Barugo.\n\nThe Jesuits stayed in Leyte from 1595 to 1767. During that time they expanded their influence starting from Carigara and Barugo, in the hinterlands of Ogmuc (Ormoc), Dulac (Dulag), Palo, Alangalang, Malibago (?) and the entire island of Cibabaw (Samar). When Charles III of Spain ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish dominions in 1767, the Jesuit mission on Leyte was handed over to the Augustinians. And later in 1843, the same missions were taken over by the Franciscan Friars. Fray Timoteo Calderon was the first Franciscan curate assigned to Barugo. At that time in 1843, Barugo already had 1,744 taxpayers and 8,381 residents. The towns of Alangalang, Jaro, Babatngon, Malibago (?) and San Miguel were once only \"visitas\" of Barugo.\n\nIn Barugo there is a legend which was being taught to elementary pupils during the 1950s and 1960s regarding how the town got its name. The legend goes like this: \"Once upon a time there was a man named Cassadok. One day while he was resting by the river bank under the shade of a giant tree, a Spaniard came along and asked him the name of the place. Cassadok did not understand Spanish and thinking the Spaniard was asking the name of the big shady tree, answered \"Balugo.\" From that time on, the place came to be known as \"Balugo.\" When the Americans came, they changed the letter \"L\" to \"R\" and thus to this day the town is called Barugo.\" This story has no basis in fact and is simply a legend. For the early Spanish historians and chroniclers have always referred to the town by the name it carries today, Barugo.\n\nToday Barugo nestles along the coast of Carigara Bay. But the original settlement of Barugo was way upstream by the banks of the Himanglos River, which during the time of the conquistadores was called Barugo River.\n\nIt is highly probable that the first Barugo settlement was in the place which is now known as Nasunogan, meaning a place burned down. This assumption is born by the fact that the old Spanish road leading to the towns of Tunga and Jaro starts at this place and the ruins of an old Spanish stone church is found there. This assumption is also corroborated, firstly, by the writings of Fr. Chirino wherein he described their travels by foot to Barugo and of a settlement by \"la orilla,\" meaning by the bank of a river and by the mouth of the river. Secondly, the story of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, regarding their attempt to reach a seriously sick man, tells of their travel from the town of Barugo by \"a small boat in which we sailed to seek our sick man, who was living in horon, far from the town and near the coast.\"\n\nFrom Nasunogan, after the old settlement was burned, the people moved to another place which is now called Binongto-an, meaning a place abandoned as a town, now a sitio of Barangay Pikas. The settlers did not stay there long and moved eventually to the present site of the town. This conclusion stems from the fact that lasting structures can be found in Binongto-an.\n\n\"(Excerpts from the research Barugo - Its Fabled History, conducted by a prominent Barugon-on, then Joel V. Aruta; excerpts edited and embellished by JC Himanglos.)\"\n\nIn the , the population of Barugo, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThese are the elected officials of the Municipality of Barugo as a result of the 2016 elections:\n\n"}

The male is blackish with a rufous collar. In females and immatures the rufous collar is incomplete or absent. Young birds also differ from the females in that they have reddish edges to the crown feathers.

He is a session and road-tour percussionist, and occasional actor, who has worked with several musically diverse bands and artists including George Harrison, Billy Joel, Rick Wakeman, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd and Elton John. Cooper absorbed the influence of rock drummers from the 1960s and 1970s such as Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice and John Bonham. Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as cowbells, glockenspiel and tubular bells, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup.\n\nContinually modified to this day, Cooper's percussion set offers a large array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity such as the tambourine, congas, crash cymbals, cowbells, rototoms, tubular bells, the gong, snare drum and timpani.\n\nCooper was born in Watford, Hertfordshire.\n\nIn addition to percussion, Cooper studied classical piano, strings and woodwind, as well as theatre. He later joined the band Blue Mink, and as a session musician he played on records for artists such as America, Carly Simon and David Essex. He played on and co-produced the album \"Somewhere in England\" by former Beatle George Harrison in 1981 (Dark Horse Records DHK 3492).\n\nCooper has long been associated with Elton John's career, playing on more than 90 recordings, and performing in more than 800 concerts with John both as a duo and in various band configurations. His first appearance with John was during the sessions for \"Madman Across the Water\", and he played his first live show with him in early 1972. Cooper had a short stint with The Rolling Stones playing percussion for their 1974 \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" album. After contributing to various Elton John albums, Cooper joined the Elton John Band full-time in 1974 and spent the next two years recording and touring with the group.\n\nDuring John's semi-retirement in the late 1970s, Cooper played on various singles and albums for John, and recorded with George Harrison, the Kinks, Wings and Art Garfunkel. In 1977 and again in 1979, Cooper toured with Elton John as a duo in which John would play a solo set and then be joined by Cooper on percussion for the second half of the concerts.\n\nCooper's relationship with the Rolling Stones continued into the 1980s. In 1981, he contributed to Bill Wyman's third solo album. In 1983, he participated in a short tour for the Ronnie Lane ARMS Charity Concert along with Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and other artists, including Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts.\n\nIn the 1980s, Cooper continued to record and tour periodically with Elton John. In 1986, he joined John's touring band for the Tour De Force (tour) concerts in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, augmenting Jody Linscott, who was the band's percussionist on the rest of John's world tour.\n\nCooper showed up on Christine McVie's self-titled solo album in 1984. In 1985, Cooper appeared on both Mick Jagger's \"She's the Boss\" album and Bill Wyman's \"Willie & The Poor Boys\". Also in 1985, Cooper performed as percussionist for a number of artists during the charity event Live Aid. In 1997, he guested with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings for \"Struttin' Our Stuff\".\n\nIn every tour during 1990, Eric Clapton and the band played \"Sunshine of Your Love\", which then flowed into a short one-minute drum solo by Steve Ferrone (drummer for Clapton's band on the tour), then into a 7-minute percussion solo by Ray Cooper on the tambourine, congas, and gong.\n\nThe success of the late 1970s \"Solo\" tour with Elton John was repeated in 1993–1994 when he and Elton John brought their two-man show to a new generation in the United States. During that time, Cooper was featured as part of a Disney Channel concert telecast, \"A Special Evening With Elton John\", recorded September 1994 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring 1994 and 1995 Face to Face tours with Billy Joel, and during Elton John's tours in 1995, Elton John played \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\", which then flowed into a solo by Cooper on percussion. In the 1995 \"Evening With Elton John and Ray Cooper\" tour, the two men performed in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Costa Rica, where John performed a solo set, then was joined by Cooper on percussion for the second half of the show. On September 15, 1997, Cooper was the principal percussionist along with Phil Collins at the Music for Montserrat fund raiser concert in Royal Albert Hall. Cooper was part of the band at the Concert for George, the memorial concert for George Harrison, held at the Royal Albert Hall in 2002. He contributed to the tribute concert for Jim Capaldi in January 2007. He worked on Katie Melua's album \"Pictures\" (2007).\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, Cooper got involved in film as a musician, actor and producer, including movies for HandMade Films, which was owned by his friend George Harrison.\n\nHe has played small roles such as the preacher in Robert Altman's feature film \"Popeye\" (1980) starring Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall. He has performed music in several of Terry Gilliam's productions, appearing on-screen in quirky roles like the technician who swats the beetle at the beginning of Gilliam's 1985 film \"Brazil\" and as the functionary whispering in the ear of Jonathan Pryce's Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson character in 1989's \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\". He appeared in the Concert for Cascara in the 1985 film \"Water\", and appears as a street commercial for \"The Zero Theorem\".\n\nThe role of Albert Arthur Moxey in the hit television series \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\" was written with Cooper in mind by friends Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, with the character originally being conceived as an Irishman, after Cooper expressed an interest in acting. The role was however given to Christopher Fairbank, who opted to play him as a scouser, due to Cooper being unable to make it to the audition and commit to the show. The character of Moxey was given only limited lines and screentime in the first series of \"Pet\" due to Cooper's acting inexperience.\n\nCooper has continued recording and performing with Elton John on various albums and tours, including John's The Million Dollar Piano show in Las Vegas. In 2009, John and Cooper performed a small exclusive series of shows, mostly in the UK and Europe, the first time since 1995 that the two had toured together without a band. Amongst their performances was one at the Royal Albert Hall to raise funds for a new organ which the Royal Academy of Music would assemble in their Duke's Hall. They raised further funds with a further performance at the Royal Opera House in 2011. The organ has been named the Sir Elton John and Ray Cooper Organ, and was heard for the first time on 7 October 2013. In a greeting to Cooper on his 70th birthday, John's website stated that when Elton composed the song \"Tambourine\" for his 2016 \"Wonderful Crazy Night\" album, he made sure to bring in Cooper to play the instrument on the track. As of June 2019, Cooper is touring with John as part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road farewell tour.\n\nCooper is known to have played tambourine, congas, maracas, bongos, cymbals, wind chimes, bell tree, triangle, timpani, bells, tubular bells, shaker, vibraphone, marimba, gong, Rototoms, jaw bone, cowbell, finger cymbals, timbales, crotales, güiro, glockenspiel, whistle, drums and snare drum.\n\nWith Elton John\n\nWith Joan Armatrading\n\nWith David Gilmour\n\nWith Murray Head\n\nWith Katie Melua\n\nWith Roger Waters\n\nWith George Harrison\n\nWith Carly Simon\n\nWith Kiki Dee\n\nWith Christine McVie\n\nWith Roy Orbison\n\nWith Art Garfunkel\n\nWith Mick Jagger\n\nWith Dana Gillespie\n\nWith Eric Clapton\n\nWith Sting\n\nWith Bryan Ferry\n\nWith Yvonne Elliman\n\nWith Paul McCartney\n\nWith Rosemary Clooney\n\nWith Bill Wyman\n\nWith Rod Stewart\n\nWith Harry Nilsson\n\nWith Lulu\n\nWith Donovan\n\nWith Madeline Bell\n\nWith Ringo Starr\n"}

It is also the name of the 20th day of the \"tzolkʼin\", the Maya divinatory calendar, on which a ruler's \"kʼatun\"-ending rituals would fall.\n\nThe word is known from several Mayan languages both those in pre-Columbian use (such as in Classic Maya), as well as in their contemporary descendant languages (in which there may be observed some slight variations). \"Ajaw\" is the modernised orthography in the standard revision of Mayan orthography, put forward in 1994 by the Guatemalan \"Academia de Lenguas Mayas\", and now widely adopted by Mayanist scholars. Before this standardisation, it was more commonly written as \"Ahau\", following the orthography of 16th-century Yucatec Maya in Spanish transcriptions (now \"Yukatek\" in the modernised style). \n\nIn the Maya hieroglyphics writing system, the representation of the word \"ajaw\" could be as either a logogram, or spelled-out syllabically. In either case, quite a few glyphic variants are known. Not surprisingly, a picture of the ruler sometimes substitutes for the more abstract day sign.\n\n\"Ajaw\" denoted any of the leading class of nobles in a particular polity. It was not limited to a single individual, with a meaning variously rendered as \"leader\", \"ruler\", \"lord\", \"king\", or \"queen\", depending on the individual. Since the \"ajaw\" performed religious activities, it also designated a member of the Maya priesthood. The variant \"kʼuhul ajaw\" (\"divine lord\") indicates a sovereign leader of a polity, although the extent of the territory and influence controlled by an \"ajaw\" varied considerably, and \"kʼuhul ajaw\" could also be applied to persons who, in theory, recognised the overlordship of another person, dynasty, or state. When the title was given to women rulers, such as K'awiil Ajaw (640-681 AD) of Coba. Sometimes the term was prefixed with the sign Ix (\"woman\") to indicate their gender.\n\nThe archaeological site of Kʼo, associated with the Classic Maya city of Holmul located in modern-day Guatemala, boasts what may be the royal tomb of the earliest known Mayan ruler. This tomb has been dated to 350-300 BC. It contains the earliest evidence of the institution of ajaw in the Maya Lowlands.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2098406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098406", "title": "Snakedance", "text": "Snakedance\n\nSnakedance is the second serial of the 20th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four twice-weekly parts on BBC1 from 18 to 26 January 1983.\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Manussa 500 years after the 1982 serial \"Kinda\". In the serial, the Mara takes over the body of Lon (Martin Clunes), the ruler's son, while seeking to manifest itself by using a crystal.\n\nThe arrival of the TARDIS on Manussa, formerly homeworld of both the Manussan Empire and Sumaran Empire, triggers nightmares in Tegan, who dreams of a snake-shaped cave mouth. It is evident to the Fifth Doctor that the Mara is reasserting itself on her mind following her possession by the entity while on the Kinda planet of Deva Loka (\"Kinda\"). He attempts to calm her by taking her and Nyssa in search of the cave but Tegan is too scared to enter when they find it, and runs away. Alone and confused Tegan lapses under the control of the Mara once more, revelling in horror and destruction. The emblem of the snake returns to her arm.\n\nManussa is in the grip of a festival of celebration of the banishment of the Mara from the civilisation five hundred years earlier. In the absence of the Federator, who rules over the three-planet Federation, his indolent son Lon is to have a major role in the celebration, supported by his mother the Lady Tanha and the archaeologist Ambril, who is an expert in the Sumaran period. Lon is intrigued with the notion that the Mara might one day return as prophesied, but Ambril is unconvinced and believes such talk is the product of cranks. When the Doctor tries to get Ambril to take the threat seriously he too is dismissed as a maverick, though the young deputy curator Chela is more sympathetic and gives the Doctor a small blue crystal called a Little Mind's Eye, which is used by the Snakedancers, a mystical cult, in their ceremonies to repel the Mara. The Doctor realises the small crystal and its large counterpart, the Great Mind's Eye, can be used as focal points for mental energy and can turn thought into matter. This, he determines, is how the Mara will transfer from Tegan's mind to corporeal existence. He realises that the Manussans must once have been a very advanced people who could use molecular engineering in a zero-gravity environment. They created the Great Mind's Eye without realising its full potential, and the crystal drew the fear, hatred, and evil from their minds, amplified it and fed it back to them. Thus the Mara was born into Manussa and the reign of the Sumaran Empire began.\n\nMeanwhile, Tegan makes contact with Lon and passes the snake mark of the Mara to him too. They visit the cave from Tegan's dream, which contains a wall pattern, which could accommodate the Great Mind's Eye. Lon is sent back to the Palace while she causes more havoc and takes control of a showman, Dugdale, who is used for her pleasure. Lon meanwhile covers his arm and goes about trying to persuade Ambril to use the real Great Mind's Eye in the ceremony, placing it in a position in a wall carving that will evidently enable the Mara to return as the Doctor predicted. To persuade him to comply, Ambril is shown a secret cave of Sumaran archaeological treasures and warned they will all be destroyed if he does not help him.\n\nThe Doctor and Nyssa have meanwhile been aided by Chela, who shares with them the journal of Dojjen, a snakedancer who was Ambril's predecessor. All three venture to the Palace to persuade the authorities to do something about the situation, but soon see Lon is in the grip of the Mara and orchestrating a very dangerous situation. All three escape and the Doctor now uses the Little Mind's Eye to contact Dojjen, who lives in sandy dunes beyond the city. They venture there and the Doctor communes with Dojjen by opening his mind after being bitten by a poisonous snake. He is told by the wise old snakedancer that the Mara may only be defeated by finding a still point in the mind. All three head back to the city to prevent the ceremony of defeating the Mara using the real Great Mind's Eye. The festivities are now at a peak, with a procession taking place which culminates in a ceremony at the cave. Lon plays the role of his ancestor Federator in rejecting the Mara. After a series of verbal challenges he seizes the real Great Mind's Eye and places it in the appropriate place on the wall. Tegan and Dugdale arrive and she displays the Mara mark on her arm, which is now becoming flesh having fed on the fear in Dugdale's mind. With the crystal in place, the Mara is able to create itself in the cave, becoming a vast and deadly snake. However, the Doctor arrives in time and refuses to look at the snake or recognise its evil, relying instead on the still place he finds through mental commune with Dojjen via the Little Mind's Eye. This resistance interrupts the manifestation of the Mara and its three slaves are freed while the snake itself dies and rots. The Doctor comforts a distraught Tegan, sure that the Mara has at last been destroyed.\n\nThe success of \"Kinda\" and this story prompted Script Editor Eric Saward to commission Bailey to write a third and final story to feature the Mara: \"May Time\". However, the story was abandoned due to production problems. In post-production, episode four of this story overran very badly. As a result, it had to be completely restructured. Originally the door for a third Mara adventure was to be left open, with closing scenes discussing the ultimate fate of the Great Crystal. Furthermore, a sequence in which the Doctor comforts Tegan had to be removed. The scene was reincorporated into the beginning of the subsequent serial, \"Mawdryn Undead\" (1983).\n\nBrian Miller was the husband of Elisabeth Sladen who portrayed long-time companion Sarah Jane Smith. He later appeared in \"Deep Breath\" in Series 8 (2014), as well as playing Harry Sowersby in \"The Mad Woman in the Attic\" (2009), a story of \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", and providing Dalek voices for both \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" (1984) and \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (1988). Brian Grellis previously played Sheprah in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975) and Safran in \"The Invisible Enemy\" (1977).\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1984. It was the first of two (the other being Enlightenment) to feature Peter Davison's image in the logo.\n\n\"Snakedance\" was released on VHS in December 1994. It was released on DVD on 7 March 2011 along with \"Kinda\" in a special edition boxset entitled \"Mara Tales\". This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 103 on 12 December 2012.\n"}

He spent part of his youth and adolescence being educated in Ottawa, Ontario, with two childhood friends, Zebedee Nungak and Eric Tagoona.

Unbeknownst to them, they had been relocated to Ottawa by federal government authorities, as part of an experiment in cultural assimilation. These actions and their consequences form the subject of the documentary \"The Experimental Eskimos\" (2009).\n\nIttinuar was originally elected as a member of the New Democratic Party, but on November 26, 1982, he crossed the floor to sit with the Liberal caucus shortly after Indian Affairs and Northern Development minister John Munro announced plans to improve Inuit self-government by dividing the Northwest Territories into two (see Nunavut).\n\nIn 1984 Ittinuar was charged with breach of trust, theft and forgery for allegedly using his parliamentary budget to purchase a boat motor.

{"id": "2098446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098446", "title": "Lysichiton", "text": "Lysichiton\n\nLysichiton is a genus in the family Araceae. These plants are known commonly as skunk cabbage or less often as swamp lantern. The spelling Lysichitum is also found. The genus has two species, one found in north-east Asia (Japan and Russian Far East), the other in north-west America (Aleutians to Santa Cruz County in California).\n\n\"Lysichiton\" has flowers which are typical of those of the family to which it belongs (the arum family or Araceae). The individual flowers are small and are tightly packed on a fleshy stem called a spadix which is surrounded by a white or yellow but otherwise leaf-like bract called a spathe. The spathe is hooded or boat-shaped at the top. \"Lysichiton\" has flowers with both male and female parts present (bisexual), unlike many other aroids. After fertilization, the green fruits become embedded in the spadix; each fruit usually has two seeds but may have up to four. Several large leaves appear either just before flowering or soon afterwards; each has a short stalk (petiole). Plants die down to a vertical rhizome in winter.\n\nThe genus \"Lysichiton\" was described by Heinrich Schott in 1857. The name is derived from two Greek words: (\"lysis\", dissolve) and (\"chiton\", armour), referring to the armour-like spathe enclosing the inflorescence that withers soon after flowering. Schott used two variants of this name in his original publication: one with a Latinized ending, \"Lysichitum\", and the other with a Greek ending, \"Lysichiton\". In two later publications he used only the second variant. Only one species was assigned to the genus, \"Lysichiton camtschatcensis\". In a paper published in 1932, Eric Hultén and Harold St. John separated American plants into a second species. They decided that Schott's \"Lysichitum\" was correct under the rules of botanical nomenclature; accordingly older sources use this spelling as the generic name for both species. In 1956 they revised their view and decided that the correct generic name was the one which was adopted latest by Schott, namely \"Lysichiton\". This is the spelling now used.\n\nAlong with other members of the subfamily Orontioideae, \"Lysichiton\" has been placed in a group of \"proto-aroids\", which appear to have evolved before the characteristic features of most aroids emerged. Thus the genus has flowers which retain small petals and which are bisexual, whereas more \"advanced\" aroids have unisexual flowers without petals.\n\nThis genus includes two species and the hybrid between them which occurred in cultivation:\n\n\nThese two species were originally considered conspecific, under the earlier-described name \"L. camtschatcensis\". The most obvious difference between them lies in the spathe, which is yellow with a green-suffused apex in \"L. americanus\" and white with at most a small amount of green at the apex in \"L. camtscatcensis\". There are also differences in the leaves. At flowering time these are almost undeveloped in \"L. camtschatcensis\", but about half grown in \"L. americanus\". \"Lysichiton americanus\" has broader leaves, rounded at the base, with glossy upper surfaces, whereas \"L. camtschatcensis\" has less broad leaves, more pointed at the base, with dull, somewhat grey-green (glaucuous) upper surfaces.\n\nBoth species, but particularly \"L. americanus\", have been used as ornamental garden plants. \"L. americanus\" was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1901 and has escaped to become naturalized in marshy areas in Britain and Ireland. The hybrid between the two species occurred in cultivation, and is larger than either parent, with a less unpleasant scent.\n\n\"Lysichiton americanus\" was used by indigenous people in various ways. See \"Lysichiton americanus\": Other uses.\n\n"}

He is the father of former drivers Glenn Jarrett and Dale Jarrett.\n\nJarrett was introduced to cars early in life: his father let him drive the family car to church on Sunday mornings when he was nine years old. Jarrett started working for his father in the sawmill by the time he was 12, but racing was what he wanted.\n\nNed drove in his first race in 1952 at Hickory Motor Speedway (North Carolina). He drove a Sportsman Series Ford that he co-owned with his brother-in-law, and finished tenth. This did not go over well with his father. His father told him he could work on cars but not drive them. Once, his brother-in-law was sick for a race and asked Jarrett to fill in for him. Jarrett used his brother-in-law's name and came in second in that race. That worked out so smoothly that Jarrett drove in a few more races under an assumed name, but was finally caught by his father after winning a race. His father told him if he was going to drive to at least use his own name.\n\nJarrett raced in his first Grand National Series race in the 1953 Southern 500 at Darlington Speedway.

He did not have enough money to cover the check, so he waited until the bank closed to write the check, entered two races, and won them both to cover the cost of his car.\n\nIn 1960, he won five races, before winning the 1961 Grand National championship with 22 top-five finishes and 34 top-ten finishes out of 46 races, with one win.\n\nOne indicator of the personal character of \"Gentleman Ned\" Jarrett is demonstrated by the decision to sell his 1961 (raced as No. 11) Chevrolet to Wendell Scott (the first NASCAR African American driver) who travelled from his Virginia home to Jarrett's shop on West \"A\" Street in Newton, NC, to take delivery of the Chevy Bel Air (raced the previous season) when Jarrett changed to Fords in 1962. Scott hauled the old blue coupe away on the back of an open trailer. Bobby Isaac frequented the shop on West A Street during this period when Bud Alman was the crew chief assisted by mechanic \"John Carl\" Ervin. Ervin later became crew chief to Jarrett and the No. 11 Fords.\n\nJarrett was once overheard talking with Alman and Ervin about the need to \"run all the races\" to win the championship. Schedules in those days sometimes included more than one race per week. Among the unique tracks of the early era was Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which was actually the area around the football field inside the Bowman Gray Stadium. The race schedule was difficult. The race teams were smaller, often having only one or two paid members. For example, Jarrett required significant effort in order to prepare for the 1963 Daytona 500 race when the latest \"fastback\" body was introduced by Ford. Alman and Ervin removed (air-chiseled) most of the body from a 1962 Ford \"fatback\" dirt car. Next, the two air-chiseled the new body from a 1963 fastback and fitted it onto the old body and chassis. This hybrid body became the car Jarrett drove to third in the \"fastback Ford\" sweep (top five positions) at Daytona that year.\n\nIn 1964, Jarrett joined team owner Bondy Long and with the support of Ford won 15 times (one of which was with Charles Robinson) but lost the championship to Richard Petty. Jarrett picked up his first superspeedway win, at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nIn 1965, Jarrett became a star when he won 13 races and another Grand National championship. He placed among the top five in 42 of the 54 races that he ran.\n\nThe 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway was one of the wildest races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended up at the end of the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were fighting for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).\n\nIn 1966, Jarrett raced in only 21 of 49 races, achieving eight top ten finishes. When Ford announced that they were withdrawing from NASCAR, Jarrett decided that it was time to retire at the age of 34. Jarrett is the only driver to retire as the NASCAR champion.\n\nErvin remained as a crew chief to the Jarrett family for years. Ervin later would become crew chief for Dale Jarrett in the No. 32 Busch car owned by DAJ racing.\n\nJarrett left racing and dealt in real estate and other business ventures before coming back to racing as a broadcaster. He also was the track promoter for Hickory Motor Speedway.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ned began a radio program on WNNC in Newton, North Carolina. His taped show was replayed and locally sponsored, in part by station owner Earl Holder, who gave him both a taping facility and recording studio time for a moderate rate to fill in local programming. It is believed by some that this radio station, WNNC, where Dr. Jerry Punch also began his career on the local high school radio station staff in 1965, was probably the beginning of Jarrett's radio career. Jarrett would sometimes record more than one radio show at a time in order to facilitate the distance required to compete in what was then the \"Grand National\" circuit of NASCAR.\n\nJarrett gives much credit to his taking a Dale Carnegie class for his success as a broadcaster and in life.\n\nLater, in 1978, Jarrett became a radio broadcaster for MRN Radio. He interviewed U.S. President Ronald Reagan live at the 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway, the race famous as Richard Petty's 200th win. Jarrett also hosted a daily radio program about racing on MRN Radio called \"\"Ned Jarrett's World of Racing\"\" until May 15, 2009, when he announced he would retire from the program. Joe Moore became its new host the following Monday, May 18.\n\nJarrett was a television broadcaster on CBS, first as a pit reporter from 1979 to 1984, and later as color analyst from 1984 to 2000; he was also color analyst on ESPN from 1989 to 2000. He called several of NASCAR's more memorable television moments. He called his son Dale's first victory (in his 129th race) in the 1991 Champion Spark Plug 400 at the Michigan International Speedway. Dale banged Davey Allison's fender at the finish line in what was then the closest finish in NASCAR history. Another famous moment was when he called Dale's victory at the 1993 Daytona 500, breaking impartiality and openly siding with his son on the last lap and coaching him home to victory over Dale Earnhardt. Embarrassed by his show of favoritism, he tried to apologize to Earnhardt after the race, but Earnhardt merely smiled and said, \"I'm a father, too.\"\n\nIn addition, Jarrett was a host for the original \"Inside NASCAR\" on TNN and \"NASCAR Tech\" on FSN.\n\nOn May 26, 2007 Ned returned to the booth to call the Carquest Auto Parts 300 Busch race alongside Andy Petree, Jerry Punch, and his son, 1999 Cup Champ, Dale Jarrett.\n\nIn 2015, as part of Darlington returning to its traditional Labor Day weekend, a throwback weekend was formed. As part of the throwback weekend, Ned Jarrett, along with his son Dale Jarrett and Ken Squier, called part of the 66th annual Southern 500. The team was reunited for part of the broadcast of the Southern 500 race in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAs of 2004, Jarrett had been inducted in 12 motorsports and sports Halls of Fame.\n\nHe was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1997.\n\nOn October 13, 2010, Jarrett was selected to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame as one of the 5 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductees of the 2011 class.\n\nHe was inducted into the 2011 class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23, 2011.\n\nNed is the father of Dale Jarrett, who earned his lone NASCAR championship in 1999 and currently is a race broadcaster for NBC Sports. Ned and Dale became the second father-son combination to win Cup championships (after Lee Petty and Richard Petty). Ned has spotted for Dale in the past. Ned's other son is Glenn Jarrett, who was a sporadic Busch Series driver and had a few Cup Series starts in the 1980s. Glenn now covers UHF television as a race broadcaster. Ned also has a daughter Patti. Patti is married to Jimmy Makar, who worked with Dale Jarrett for three years at Joe Gibbs Racing, and won the 2000 championship crew chief with Bobby Labonte. Dale's son Jason Jarrett also had a few Busch and Cup starts, with wins in the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2098540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098540", "title": "Sneinton", "text": "Sneinton\n\nSneinton (pronounced \"Snenton\") is a village and suburb of Nottingham, England. The area is bounded by Nottingham City Centre to the west, Bakersfield to the north, Colwick to the east, and the River Trent to the south. Sneinton now lies within the unitary authority of Nottingham, having been part of Nottinghamshire until 1877.\n\nSneinton has existed as a village since at least 1086, but remained relatively unchanged up until the industrial era, when the population dramatically expanded. Further social change in the post-war period left Sneinton with a multicultural character. Sneinton residents of note include William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, and mathematician George Green, who worked Green's Mill at the top of Belvoir Hill.\n\nThe history of Sneinton is inextricably tied to that of its near neighbour, the City of Nottingham. When the area that is now Nottingham was settled by the Anglo-Saxon chieftain \"Snot\", he named the settlement \"Snottingham\" (the homestead of Snot's people, where \"inga\" = the people of; \"ham\" = homestead), and the area east of the city, also settled by Saxons, was called \"Snottington\" (the suffix \"ton\" = farmstead settlement). Sneinton is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where is referred to as \"Notintone\", which represents the Norman pronunciation of an Anglo-Saxon placename, with the \"Sn\" dropped in favour of \"N\", which was easier to say in the Norman language. The Norman pronunciation of \"Nottingham\" stuck, whereas their pronunciation of \"Notintone\" did not. In the years between 1086 and 1599, \"Sneinton\" became the agreed way of spelling the village name.\n\nUntil the 19th century Sneinton was no more than a village, standing on a high ridge about a mile east of Nottingham town centre overlooking the valley of the River Trent. The village was to change dramatically when the principal landowner of the time, the First Earl Manvers, sold off the land between Nottingham and Sneinton to developers. Housing was built on the land in which Nottingham's factory workers lived. Building regulations at that time where somewhat lax, and so the new landscape was to become a slum. Poverty and poor sanitation were facts of life for those living in these cramped tenements.\n\nGreen's Mill, a red brick tower mill, was built around 1807 on the site of a previous smaller post mill. When the founder of the mill died, his son, renowned mathematician George Green, inherited and operated it until his death in 1841. Near Green's Mill stood the imposing Nottingham Lunatic Asylum, the first County Asylum to open in England, which existed from 1812 to 1902. It was later converted into a boarding school named King Edward's, governed by the infamous head master Alfred Tanner and his wife Mary. Children were killed in industrial accidents at the school. It has since been demolished and is now the location of King Edward Park. At the end of the Nineteenth century, the Third Earl Manvers sold off the remainder of the Pierrepont family land to developers, who subsequently build all of the Victorian housing on the slopes of Sneinton Dale. This housing was of a higher standard than the previous development, and still stands to this day. The population then grew to a peak of 23,093 in 1901, as lace and textile manufacturing expanded along with heavy industry.\n\nIn the 1930s, Nottingham began to address the problem of overcrowding. Many people in Sneinton at the time were living in the older, cramped, unfit-for-purpose damp Victorian housing. These homes were generally rented, so it was a trivial process use clearance orders to evict tenants. Unfit houses were demolished, and the land redeveloped under the \"Carter Gate\" redevelopment. Further development was put on hold due to World War II, during which Sneinton was heavily bombed. A map produced by the local Civil Defence Departments showed that many of the industrial units on Meadow Lane received direct hits.\n\nLater in the 1950s came the \"Chedworth Estate\" redevelopment. A large amount of modern housing was built during this period, as well as five multi-story tower blocks, all of which stand to the present day. Around this time, economic migrants began to settle in Sneinton, drawn by affordable housing near to places of work.\n\nIn the 21st century, Sneinton has retained a sense of community, giving it a village-like feel, which has so far resisted gentrification. As of 2014, Sneinton has the 11th lowest crime rate out of the 25 Nottingham districts, beating all other comparable inner city areas (such as St Ann's, the Meadows, and Radford). House prices have risen over the past few decades but housing remains cheaper in Sneinton than in other Nottingham suburbs. This may change when the planned \"Eastside\" urban renewal projects beside Sneinton are completed.\n\nSneinton was officially incorporated into the borough of Nottingham in 1877. It now lies within the unitary authority of Nottingham, and so is governed by Nottingham City Council. Nottingham has been sending MPs to Westminster since 1295; the constituency was split up in 1885 and Sneinton has been part of Nottingham East ever since. Within the Nottingham East constituency, Sneinton mostly lies within the Dales electoral ward, though the Sneinton Elements estate is included in the St. Anns ward instead.\n\nSneinton is the area around Sneinton Dale road, which runs for about two miles east of Nottingham city centre until it turns into Oakdale at a roundabout marking the boundary with the 1930s suburb of Bakersfield to the east. Otherwise the boundaries are blurred - Carlton Road and the A612 Newark road are generally regarded as the northern and southern boundaries of the residential area, but the Dales electoral ward, which includes Sneinton and Bakersfield, extends south of the Newark road down to the river. Thus the ward includes riverside industrial areas, the racecourse, Colwick Woods and Colwick Country Park as they are within the city boundary and Colwick is outside it in Gedling borough. The ward boundary mostly runs south of Carlton Road but some estate agents may describe property north of it around Victoria Park as being in Sneinton rather than the troubled area of St Ann's. The western boundary of the ward comes up from Lady Bay Bridge along the A6011 Meadow Lane which turns into the A612 Manvers Road.\n\nSneinton sits on soft Bunter sandstone (of the Sherwood Sandstone Group type), overlaid on top of Keuper marls (of the Mercia Mudstone Group). Nottinghamshire's sandstone ridges can easily be dug with simple hand tools to create artificial cave dwellings. The general area around what is now Nottingham was once known in the Brythonic language as \"Tigguo Cobauc\" meaning \"The Place of Caves\" and was referred to as such by the Bishop of Sherborne Asser in 893 AD in \"The Life of King Alfred\". Cave dwellings extended out into Sneinton, wherein they were referred to as the \"Hermitage\", being as they were occupied by members of a reclusive religious order. When Manvers Road was first constructed, brick buildings were built facing into the sandstone, using the caves as back rooms. In 1829 a rock collapse destroyed these buildings, and in 1897 a railway expansion forced Manvers Road to divert, cutting away much of the rockface, erasing most of Sneinton's remaining caves. What little remains can still be seen along the edge of Sneinton Hermitage.\n\nIn 1801 the population of Sneinton stood at just 558. By 1851, Sneinton's population had grown to 8,440. The population peaked at 23,093 in 1901. \nPeople from the West Indies, Southern Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, The Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, Africa, South America and North America are all represented in Sneinton, but the greatest single population comes from Pakistan. As result of this mixed migrant population, the area has a multicultural character, and has a diverse range of restaurants and stores. In 2011, the population stood at 12,689 people, of which 60% was white, 20% Asian, 8% black, 9% mixed, 2% other.\n\nIn the 19th century the local industries were lace and textile manufacturing, like most of Nottingham. In Sneinton, heavier industries were also represented, such as the iron foundry, engineering works, and brickworks, sited at the eastern end of Sneinton Dale. Most of the existing red brick terraced houses were built in the nineteenth century, and many of the factories and warehouses of that era have long since been demolished to make way for additional housing.\n\nSneinton has a traditional open-air public market situated at the north-western end of Sneinton, where the district meets the city centre. Though the Market has struggled in recent years due to its relative isolation amongst surrounding derelict buildings, Sneinton Dale and Sneinton Boulevard, the two main high streets through the village, have weathered the recession and are thriving. The Sneinton Business Forum represents over 160 local businesses.\n\nThere are major plans to dramatically renovate Sneinton Market and the entire area that forms a buffer zone between Sneinton and the Nottingham city centre. This urban regeneration project has been called \"Nottingham Eastside\" by developers, but the start date has been pushed back numerous times, due to a lack of funding amidst the Great Recession. The Eastside development ties in with Nottingham City Council's ambitions to develop the south eastern part of the city centre into a \"Creative Quarter\". The area includes the Lace Market, Hockley, Broadmarsh East, the Eastside Island site and BioCity, the project aims at creating growth and jobs. In July 2012, the government contributed £25 million towards a £45 million venture capital fund, mainly targeted at the Creative Quarter.\n\nThe art gallery Trade is one of a number of projects at One Thoresby St, listed as one of \"the world's best secret art galleries\" by Alexander Farquharson of Nottingham Contemporary. Sneinton Dale was previously the site of an art deco film house called Dale Cinema, which operated from 1932 to 1957. There are around a dozen public houses in Sneinton, the oldest of which is The Lord Nelson, sited in a 500-year-old building which was originally a coaching inn called The Hornbuckles. The studios of regional radio station Gem 106 are nearby on the City Link.\n\nEvery July, Sneinton holds a festival organised around a different theme. The first festival was held in 1995, and is run by a volunteer group made up of local residents, representatives of local organisations, community groups, schools, church, youth and play groups, artists, musicians, performers and local project workers. Since 2002, the group has been supported and coordinated by the Sneinton Community Project.\n\nThe Sneinton Festival has three elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, and the final carnival. Workshops organised by The Festival Group take place in the run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of arts-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a parade held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.\n\nThere are several parks and allotments within Sneinton, such as Belvoir Park and the Dale Allotments, but by far the largest green space is Colwick Woods. Colwick Woods lies to the east of Sneinton, and, at 50 hectares or 123 acres, is almost as large as Sneinton itself. It is a mixture of grassland and ancient woodland, and forms a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The ancient woodland is a habitat for indicator species such as dogs mercury and ramsons. The site is rich in mammal species including both species of pipistrelle and noctule bat. Public rights of way are marked out across the site, along with desire paths that run throughout the woods. The woods and meadows, unusually close to a city centre, are very popular with local people for outdoor activities including walking, mountain biking, and other activities.\n\nSteep hills are a characteristic feature of most of the site, and wheelchair access is only from Greenwood Road into the open grassland. Greenwood Dale High School shares a boundary with the reserve and educational events have been held in partnership with the school including photographic scavenger hunts and sapling collection. Open days are held in the summer allowing the public to be actively involved with the reserve. Colwick Woods has an active Friends Group who meet regularly to discuss the condition of the site and carry out wildlife conservation activities in the woods.\n\nGreen's Mill is a restored and working 19th century tower windmill, located at the top of Belvoir Hill, overlooking the city of Nottingham. Built in the early 1800s for the milling of wheat into flour, it remained in use until the 1860s. It was renovated in the 1980s and is now part of a science centre, which together have become a local tourist attraction.\nThe Sneinton Dragon is a large sculpture that stands at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what they would like to see as a piece of public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There are also three other sculptures in Sneinton.\n\nThe main High Street through the village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the residential streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the Second Boer War. Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and to the west and south by the A612 road (Manvers Street and Colwick Loop Road) which runs from Nottingham to Newark-on-Trent. The railway to Netherfield and Grantham runs through Sneinton but it has not had a station since the Racecourse station shut in 1959. The Nottingham Suburban Railway connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with Daybrook, but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. Tramlines once ran down Carlton Road.\n\nBuses\n\nSneinton has six primary school providers, William Booth Primary School, Edale Rise Primary and Nursery School, Sneinton St Stephen's CofE Primary School, Windmill L.E.A.D. Academy, the Iona School, and The Nottingham Academy (operating from the former Jesse Boot Primary School). Nottingham Academy also runs the only secondary school in the area, on the sites of the former Greenwood Dale and Elliot Durham Schools. Sneinton has a public library, which can be found on Sneinton Dale (at the former Sneinton Police Station site).\n\nThe religious life of Sneinton reflects the diversity of its inhabitants. The main religious denomination has traditionally been the Church of England, which is represented by four churches: St. Christopher's, St. Cyprian's, St. Matthias' and St. Stephen's. St. Steven's is the parish church at the centre of the parish of \"St Stephen with St Matthias\". Two former Church of England sites have been taken over by other denominations, namely St Alban's, which is now Catholic, and St. Luke's which is now the Congregation of Yahweh. The Albion Congregational Church also lies within Sneinton. St Mary's and St. George's is the local Coptic Christian place of worship, and Bethesda represents the Pentacostal faith. Beyond Christianity, there is also a Hindu Temple & Community Centre on Carlton Road, and the Jamia Masjid Sultania mosque was recently built on Sneinton Dale, giving the Muslim community a place to worship.\n\nGyms in the village include the award-winning Victoria Leisure Centre. Carlton Town F.C. is a local football team, that was founded as Sneinton F.C. in 1904. There are two local basketball teams; the men's team is the Beeston Tropics, and the women's is the Nottingham Wildcats.\n\nSneinton was the birthplace of the mathematician George Green (born 1793) who lived in a house beside one of the village windmills, one of which he owned and ran. William Booth, the founder of The Salvation Army, was born in 1829 in the house which is now The William Booth Birthplace Museum, located on Notintone Place. Another famous son of Sneinton was the bare knuckle boxing champion, William Thompson, better known as Bendigo. A public house in the area still proudly bears a statue of the figure above its door, though it is now named \"The Hermitage\". Lydia Beardsall, mother of D.H. Lawrence, came from Sneinton and married Arthur Lawrence in St Stephen's on 27 December 1875. A more recent Sneinton celebrity is the film director Shane Meadows who lived in Sneinton and filmed some of his early works partly in Sneinton, including \"Small Time\" in 1996.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2098557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098557", "title": "Waqt: The Race Against Time", "text": "Waqt: The Race Against Time\n\nWaqt: The Race Against Time () is a 2005 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film directed and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani in the principal roles. To date, the film is the fourth and the final motion picture to feature the successful pair of Kumar and Chopra. Based on a Gujarati play by Aatish Kapadia, \"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" is a story of a rich businessman and his spoilt son and follows the journey of the father who unwantedly becomes very strict in order to teach his sons life lessons before its too late.\n\nShah wanted to make a film about father-son relationship grounded in reality that would be different from standard Bollywood father-son story. After watching Kapadia's play, the director was impressed and bought the rights for a film adaptation. Kapadia also adapted the film for the screen. Principal photography was done on the fourteen sets built in Filmistan Studio in Mumbai, with a song being filmed in Leh, Ladakh, India. The soundtrack was composed by Anu Malik while the lyrics were written by Sameer, with an exception of one song which was written by Kapadia. After the release of the album, the song \"Do Me A Favor Lets Play Holi\" became widely popular. Over the years, the song continues to be one of the most popular Holi songs.\n\nMade on a budget of 160 million, \"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" was released on 22 April 2005. The film was a box office success, grossing over 424.8 million. It was the seventh highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. The film was an even bigger success in the overseas market, particularly in the United Kingdom where it was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2005. The film received two Filmfare Awards nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Shah and Best Comedic Actor for Yadav. In addition, Shah won the Stardust Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n\nIshwarchand Thakur and Sumitra Thakur are a married couple who run a toy factory together. They have a son named Aditya Thakur who does not have any interest in responsibility or what he wants to do in life. It gets even worse when he elopes with his girlfriend, Pooja, the daughter of Natu.\n\nWhen Pooja gets pregnant, both Ishwar and Sumitra decide to make Aditya realise his responsibilities, as he will have to take care of his wife and child. They take drastic measures and throw Aditya out of the house along with Pooja. As a result, Aditya and Pooja live in a room at the back of the house in the garden. The force becomes so bad that Aditya begins to hate his father and they do not speak to each other for a long time. At the same time, Aditya becomes aware of his role in life.\n\nHowever, Ishwar has done all this for a reason and is hiding something. Ishwar is trying to make sure that his son is secure but because he is suffering from lung cancer and he wants his son to be responsible. Aditya succeeds in becoming a responsible man and also finds out the truth about his father when his father comes for his performance on the stage. He steps on the stage but instead, he asks the audience to pray to god to give a minute of their lives to keep his father alive until his son's birth. His father is alive until his son is born and he names the baby boy 'Ishwar' after himself and he dies. The movie reaches its climax with Aditya welcoming children at his father's toy factory and playing with an alone, disabled boy like Ishwar did at the start of the film with his family there including his toddler Ishwar. The spirit of Ishwar touches Sumitra's flowers in her hair and it reminds her of the old times.\n\nThe cast is listed below:\n\nDirector Vipul Amrutlal Shah wanted to make a film about a \"father-son relationship\" that would be different from \"standard Bollywood father-son\" story. Shah wanted to explore different nuances of the relationship and touch upon different themes about a father-son relationship grounded in reality that had not been shown in Bollywood. After watching Aatish Kapadia's Gujarati play, \"Awajo Vahala Phari Malishu\" (My beloved, We Will Meet Again), Shah liked it and bought its rights for a film adaptation. Kapadia, who had co-written Shah's previous film \"Aankhen\" (2002) with him, adapted his play for the screen. About the theme of the film, Shah said \"It is an unusual story of a father and a son. It is very, very real and believable. I can assure you that any father-son duo of any economic strata will be able to identify with the father and son in my film.\" Shah felt that the film was \"straight from the heart\", saying \"\"Waqt\" is about the upbringing that a father gives to a kid. And that is the biggest job and challenge in a father's life. So it automatically leads to a lot of emotional conflict within the family.\" On being asked about the title of the film, Shah said that he felt that it suited the theme of the film perfectly, saying \"\"Waqt\" is called The Race Against Time because there is a target that both father and son have set out to achieve, and for that they've got limited time. So there really is a race against the clock. If they don't achieve their targets in that time, life will take a very disastrous turn. They each have their own target.\" The film was produced by Shah under his production company Blockbuster Movie Entertainers and presented by Manmohan Shetty's company Entertainment One and Kishore Lulla and Sunil Lulla's company Eros International. It was the first major co-production for Eros International.\n\nShah himself did the casting of the film for the six main characters. In late May 2003, Shah revealed that he had cast Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, who both starred in his previous film \"Aakhen\", as the father-son and hoped to cast his wife Shefali Shah for one of the \"two strong female characters\" in the film. Shah cast Priyanka Chopra for the other female role of Kumar's wife in the film after seeing her performance in her debut film \"\" (2003). It is the fourth and final film to date to star the successful pair of Kumar and Chopra after the successful films such as \"Andaaz\" (2003), \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" (2004) and \"Aitraaz\" (2004). Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani rounded up the cast. Shah had earlier planned to cast Bachchan along with his real life son Abhishek Bachchan but due to their busy schedules they could not together commit to the film. Shah had approached Bachchan with two different scripts which he was planning at the time and asked him to choose which one he wanted to do with his son. He ultimately chose the script of \"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" but in order to get the pair in the film, Shah had to wait one year. Therefore he dropped the idea and cast Kumar instead for the role. Shah had also approached Paresh Rawal for a role in the film. Shefali Shah, who is even younger than Kumar, was cast to play his mother and wife to the much older Bachachan. The director wanted to cast an actress who had not been paired opposite him before and while discussing the potential contenders for the role, Bachchan suggested Shefali's name who he thought would be perfect for the role. Shah was apprehensive to cast his wife, saying \"I thought people would say I was trying to promote my wife. So I didn't mention her name as a possible co-star to Amitji\"; however Bachchan asked him to at least audition her or for a photo shoot before making his mind. The director did a photo shoot with Bachachan, Kumar and his wife, which he later described saying that they looked like a family and after fifteen days was officially cast in the film.\n\nBachchan watched the play and was attracted to the setting, situations and the character's relationship and behavior. He said \" I was attracted to just these facts -- how these relationships have been built up; and how the interactions, the situations, are brought up; what the characters do, how they behave; the events that take place; and the eventual solution.\" The actor thought that the \"interesting screenplay\" was \"really funny\" in addition to being \"quite emotional\" and the treatment of the film made it different from other films. Bachchan described his character as a lenient father who had spolied his son to a great extent but later turns into a \"strict father\" to teach the son the valuable life lessons which creates conflict in their life, saying \"He doesn't really want to be rude to the son but he has to be, because he feels that unless he's rude the son is not going to learn anything. So his behaviour is made to be harsh and rude, and that's how it transpires.\"\n\nKumar was drawn to the film because of its story, saying \"When Vipul narrated this story to me, I was very touched by it. In many ways, it is a lot like my own life.\" Kumar said that it was his \"most personal film\" and that he worked \"very honestly\" on the film. The actor revealed that at one point he was in talks to produce the film with Shah but it could not work out. Chopra felt that the film had the quality to make people laugh and cry and described her role to be of a \"spoilt brat\" and a \"supporting wife\" who stand by her husband in the tough times, saying \"Because she is brought up with every possible luxury that she would want and then suddenly she reaches a point where she has to deal with life and see how difficult it can be.\"\n\nShefali revealed that the strengths of the film were its \"simplicity and honesty\" and found playing a \"50 year old woman\" whose life revolves \"around her husband and her child\" to be challenging. She felt that her character was strong and different from the usual mothers portrayed in Bollywood films, saying \"She is someone who has come up the hard way in life and understands the importance of whatever her husband has achieved. She wants her son to understand that and stand on his own feet and achieve what her husband has been able to achieve. Her ability to laugh at situations and her sense of humour when her world is falling apart is her strength.\" Yadav found the his character of a dimwit to be a \"good role\", saying \"he reacts very slowly. Although he tries hard but his level of intelligence is only that much.\" Irani called his character \"loud, brazen, shameless, egotistical\" who \"keeps reminding him [Bachchan's character], that his son is a useless character because he himself has a wonderful daughter\", something which he found easy to portray, saying \"The character is a reasonably an easy connect because we do have so many people like that around.\" Vikram Phadnis designed the costumes for the actors.\n\n\"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" was launched amid fanfare on 24 November 2003 at an event held on Juhu Beach in Mumbai. In an innovative step, the Muhurat shot was staged at this event which started with an audio visual presentation hosted by Chopra and followed by Bachchan, Kumar and Chopra's enacting a live performance on the stage. Shah revealed the reason behind holding an event on a stage created in the middle of a beach which any common public person was allowed to attend and watch, saying \"I've chosen this location in particular only because I want the common man to witness and be a part of the mahurat of a Hindi film.\" Media reported that the crew was looking to start filming in January or February 2004.\n\nPrincipal photography was done on the sets built in Filmistan Studio in Mumbai. The production design was done by Omung Kumar. A total of fourteen sets were constructed for the film. Santosh Thundiyil and Ashok Mehta handled the cinematography. Mehta was credited as a \"guest cinematographer\" in the film for only shooting at \"the location of the Ishar [Bachchan's character] House\". Several scenes were shot out of chronological order, filming the scenes based in one particular set in one go, to save time. An action scene featuring Kumar being chased by twenty Alsatians was shot. Initially the scene was supposed to have only five dogs but Kumar felt it looked weak and hence asked for more dogs in the scene to give it a tension filled feel.\n\nThe songs were choreographed by Remo D'Souza. The song \"Subah Hogee\" was shot in Leh, Ladakh, India. The song was filmed at Pangong Lake and at Nimmu where river Indus and Zanskar merge. Bachachan who has featured in a number of Holi songs in his film career do not feature in the film's Holi number \"Do Me A Favour Lets Play Holi\". Shah initially tried putting Bachchan in the song but ultimately decided not to as it did not fit in the script, calling it a \"tough decision\". While filming the Holi song on one of the sets, Chopra met with an accident. The set was wet and so was Chopra while filming the Holi dance sequences; after the choreographer called for break, she went to trailer to dry off and while approaching the door of the van as she was electrocuted as she turned the knob of the door. Her hand stuck to the knob but thankfully her hairdresser who was around knocked her away from the knob and saved her. After the incident Chopra had fallen unconscious and was rushed to the nearby Lilavati hospital. After two hours she got out the hospital and went back to the studio to complete the filming that same night. In early December 2004, Shah revealed that he was looking for another 20 days of filming before wrapping the film, followed by three to four months of post-production and an April 2005 release. The film was edited by Shirish Kunder.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" was composed by Anu Malik and the lyrics were written by Sameer, with an exception of one song which was written by Aatish Kapadia. The album consists of seven compositions: six original songs and an original Instrumental. The song's vocals are provided by Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Adnan Sami, Sonu Nigam, Sudesh Bhosle, Mahalakshmi Iyer, Sunidhi Chauhan, Malik and Kailash Kher. The soundtrack was released in February 2005 on T-Series.\n\nShah had said that they had decided to have an unusual Holi song \"Do Me A Favor Lets Play Holi\" with contemporary sound to suit the contemporary times thus, starting it in a traditional folkway and ending with hip-hop, saying \"So in a way it shows the journey from where holi has started and where it has reached today. And to bring in a different feel we decided to start it with an English line. After the release of the album, the song became widely popular. Over the years, the song continues to remain one of the most popular Bollywood Holi songs.\n\nBollywood Hungama felt that the overall album was \"satisfying\", writing \"The opening tracks of \"Waqt\" are good, but subsequent songs, starting from \"Chhup Ja\" get you all excited about the music. The holi number and the club track are the pick of the lot while \"Miraksam\" would also stay on for a few weeks at least.\" The review praised the song Chhup Ja Chuup Ja\" calling it a \"beautifully composed subtle love song\", with great orchestra throughout and excellent singing by Nigam and Chauhan, and its \"sweetly paced\" lyrics by Sameer which he thought stood out. It also noted \"Do Me A Favour Lets Play Holi\" to be different from \"a routine Holi number\", calling it an \"enjoyable affair\" but he felt that the \"rap'n'reggae\" bits in \"Miraksam\" made it sound familiar. \"India Today\" noted that the album \"showcases a new, improved Anu Malik\" with good melodies which were very carefully crafted\" and wrote \"Miraksam is already a hit-a typical shaadi ka gana with lots of verve and wit. In Toot gaya, another facet of Kailash Kher's voice comes to the fore-very soulful.\" Planet Bollywood rated the album 7.5 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack had \"a handful of chartbusters\", writing that is was \"one of the better albums released\" in the year.\" The reviewer called the song \"Subah Hogi\" as \"infectious\", noting \"the perfect blend\" of flutes and tabla beats in the background, and Narayan and Yagnik's melodious singing on the track. It also praised Sameer's lyrics on \"Toot Gayaa\" which he noted as an \"impressive use of words to talk about heartbreak\". On the other hand, it was critical of the song \"Apne Jahanke\", calling it \"boring\".\n\nThe film's marketing started in November 2003 with the launch of the film at the Juhu Beach which was done to attract public attention to the film. Shah thought it was a marketing tool to spread awareness about the film for the normal public, saying \"I strongly believe that Waqt is one such film, which has a universal appeal and a father-son bonding that is highly identifiable. So I wanted the common man to be aware of it.\" In late December 2004 with the makers launching a special line of greeting cards in collaboration with Archies, titled the \"\"Waqt\" collection\". This strategy was aimed to showcase the \"quiet bond of fathers and sons\"; the cards had two sections \"Dear Father\" and \"Dear Son\" dedicated with buyers having the options to dedicate it to either their father or son, and the sections had Bachchan's autographed and Kumar's personalised message, respectively. The two teasers of the filmone trailer and one song promo were released on 30 January 2005. This was the first time that two different teasers of a Bollywood film had been released on the same day. Taran Adarsh noted that the trailers created a \"stir\" and that \"creating a lot of buzz in the industry circles.\" In March 2004, the makers released a brochure which was written by Bachchan himself who wrote the story describing the relationship of his character with his son.\nTo promote the film, a contest titled \"\"Waqt\": Dad & I with Akshay\" was held with collaboration with the Fame Cinemas multiplex chain offering a bike ride with Kumar to the winners. It also offered movie tickets, merchandise, clothing, autographed music CDs and brochures of the film. In another collaboration with Archies, the makers of the film launched an entire range of a toy \"Geri Giraffe\" (featured in the film) merchandise consisting of greeting cards, soft-toys, stationery and posters that were made available across all Archies outlets and paper-rose shops. Archies had also launched a range of stationery and merchandises of the film. Bachchan also promoted the film internationally by participating in press interviews in New York. Kumar had also bought the rights of the film in order to pay a tribute to his own father by showing a photograph of his father before the opening credits of the film, saying that the film felt \"autobiographical\" to him as he shared similar relationshio with his own father. Kumar said \"I'm dedicating this film to my father. I've bought the distribution rights, so that I can see my father's photograph there. It's personally a very close film to me. I've worked very honestly in this film. I haven't bought the rights to the film in order to make money, but to pay a respectful tribute to my father.\"\n\nA preimere for the film was held the IMAX theatre on 21 April 2005 in Mumbai which was attended by the whole cast and crew. Distributed by Eros International and made on a budget of 160 million, the film was released on 22 April 2005 on 400 screens. The film had a good opening at the box office. It collected over 19 million on its opening day and 57.8 million in its opening weekend at the domestic box office and had the worldwide opening weekend of over 133.5 million. The film also had a \"solid\" opening in the overseas markets such as the United Kingdom and North America. In its first week, the film went on to do 93.7 million at the domestic box office and over 200 million worldwide. After its box office run, the film grossed 292 million at the domestic box office and over 132.5 million in the overseas market for a total worldwide gross of over 424.8 million. The film was a box office success. It was the seventh highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. \"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" was an even bigger success in the overseas market, particularly in the United Kingdom where it was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2005.\n\n\"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" was released on DVD on 6 June 2005 across all regions in an NTSC-format single disc by Eros Entertainment. The DVD contained bonus features such as the making of the film, press meet and interviews, and the premiere of the film. The VCD version was released at the same time. The film premiered on Sony Max on 8 January 2006. The actor said \"I'm dedicating this film to my father. I've bought the distribution rights, so that I can see my father's photograph there. It's personally a very close film to me. I haven't bought the rights to the film in order to make money, but to pay a respectful tribute to my father.\"\n\nTaran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 out of 5, calling it a \"must-see for every parent and every child\" and wrote \"\"Waqt: The Race Against Time\" is a well-made family entertainer that makes you laugh and cry, thanks to the strong emotional quotient in the film. Here's a film that should strike a chord with every family.\" He praised the technical aspects of the films such as the \"first-rate\" cinematography that made the film look \"visually rich\" and \"opulent\" production design. Prasing the performances, he wrote \"Amitabh Bachchan proves yet again that he's invincible when it comes to dramatics. The energy and vigor with which he performs every scene and dance make you look at him in complete awe. Akshay Kumar [...] handles his part with complete understanding of the character and scores in the emotional moments, mainly in the post-interval portions. Shefali Shah [...] conveys the pathos convincingly. Also, she matches the Big B at every step. Priyanka Chopra doesn't get meaty scenes in the enterprise, but she does leave an impact nonetheless. Boman Irani excels and together with Rajpal Yadav brings the house down. Yadav specially is outstanding.\"\n\nPlanet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10, noting it as a \"perfect family film\" with \"drama, comedy, good performances and a good social theme\" and praised Shah's direction, writing \"Vipul Shah’s direction gets his message across about parents giving more responsibility to their children. The story moves much faster once the real drama begins in the second half.\" Writing for \"India Today\", film critic Anupama Chopra called the film \"unashamedly cheesy and surprisingly moving\" and \"a good time pass\", concluding \"Vipul Amrutlal Shah and his writer Aatish Kapadia are not afraid of bringing out the violins and yanking at heart-strings. So the film has genuinely touching scenes and some easy laughs provided by Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav.\" \"Variety\" called the film a \"belt-and-braces Bollywood family drama\" and wrote \"pitched squarely at Indian auds, both at home and overseas, who like their entertainment traditional. For Western viewers, pic just gets by on its unabashed charm and minor wrinkles to the formula.\"\n\nIndo-Asian News Service critic Subhash K. Jha praised Kapadia's writing whose \"one-liners and quips flow out with constant and instant comic consequences\" and wrote \"its inherent transparency of purpose and sincerity of expression guide the lengthy family saga through a series of carefully nurtured slopes and dips that culminate in a rabble-rousing emotionally cataclysmic climax.\" Jha felt that the film did not require so many songs and praised the performances, noting Bachchan's \"leonine strides\" across the film that created an \"atmosphere conducive to pleasurable acting for the entire cast\", Kumar's inspired performance \"beyond anything he has done so far\", Shah's expressive eyes which conveys \"spousal and matriarchal pain that you come home with\", Chopra for creating and leaving \"a sinewy impression\" despite not being pivotal to the plot, the outstanding characterisation of Yadav and his \"deadpan depiction of the exasperatingly daft\" domestic servant, and Irani's \"ever-bubbling brilliancy\" and sarcasm that \"brings miles of smiles and acres of chuckles\". Rediff.com praised the humour in the film but felt that the film had excessive number of songs, calling some of them \"unnecessary burden\" and wrote \"Waqt might manage to warm the cockles, it simply doesn't turn up the heat. It leaves you wanting more. Watch \"Waqt\" if you are a serious AB-Akki fan or have the time to kill.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2098579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098579", "title": "White Lotus", "text": "White Lotus\n\nThe White Lotus () was a religious and political movement that appealed to many Han Chinese who found solace in worship of Wusheng Laomu (\"Unborn Venerable Mother\" ()), who was foretold to gather all her children at the millennium into one family.\n\nThe doctrine of the White Lotus included a forecast of the imminent advent of the future Buddha, Maitreya.\n\nThe White Lotus originated as a hybrid movement of Buddhism and Manichaeism that emphasized strict vegetarianism; its permission for men and women to interact freely was considered socially shocking. Like other secret societies, they covered up their unusual or illicit activities as \"incense-burning ceremonies\". The first signs of the White Lotus Society came during the late thirteenth century. Mongol rule over China during the Yuan dynasty prompted small yet popular demonstrations against its rule. The White Lotus Society took part in some of these protests as they grew into widespread dissent.\n\nThe Mongols considered the White Lotus society a heterodox religious sect and banned it, forcing its members to go underground. Now a secret society, the White Lotus became an instrument of quasi-national resistance and religious organization. This fear of secret societies carried on in the law; the Great Qing Legal Code, which was in effect until 1912, contained the following section:\nThe White Lotus was a fertile ground for fermenting rebellion.\n\nA Buddhist monk from Jiangxi named Peng Yingyu began to study the White Lotus and ended up organizing a rebellion in the 1330s. Although the rebellion was put down, Peng survived and hid in Anhui, then reappeared back in South China where he led another unsuccessful rebellion in which he was killed. This second rebellion changed its colors from white to red and its soldiers were known as the \"Red Turbans\" for their red bandannas.\n\nAnother revolution inspired by the White Lotus society took shape in 1352 around Guangzhou. A Buddhist monk and former boy-beggar, the future Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang, joined the rebellion. His exceptional intelligence took him to the head of a rebel army; he won people to his side by forbidding his soldiers to pillage in observance of White Lotus religious beliefs. By 1355 the rebellion had spread through much of China.\n\nIn 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang captured the important city of Nanjing (then called \"Jiqing\") and made it his capital, renaming it \"Yingtian\" . It was here that he began to discard his heterodox beliefs and so won the help of Confucian scholars who issued pronouncements for him and performed rituals in his claim of the Mandate of Heaven, the first step toward establishing a new dynastic rule.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mongols were fighting among themselves, inhibiting their ability to suppress the rebellion. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang extended his rule to Guangzhou, the same year that the Mongol ruler, Toghon Temür, fled to Karakorum. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang and his army entered the former capital of Beijing and in 1371 his army moved through Sichuan to the southwest.\n\nBy 1387, after more than thirty years of war, Zhu Yuanzhang had liberated all of China. He took the title Hongwu Emperor and founded the Ming dynasty, whose name echoes the religious sentiment of the White Lotus.\n\nA White Lotus uprising in 1622 was recorded in a Jonathan D. Spence book, \"The Death of Woman Wang\".\n\nThe White Lotus reemerged in the late 18th century in the form of an inspired Chinese movement in many different forms and sects.\n\nIn 1774, the herbalist and martial artist Wang Lun founded a derivative sect of the White Lotus that promoted underground meditation teachings in Shandong province, not far from Beijing near the city of Linqing. The sect led an uprising that captured three small cities and laid siege to the larger city of Linqing, a strategic location on the north-south Grand Canal transportation route. After initial success, he was outnumbered and defeated by Qing troops, including local armies of Chinese soldiers known as the Green Standard Army.\n\nAn account of Wang Lun's death was given to Qing authorities by a captured rebel. Wang Lun remained sitting in his headquarters wearing a purple robe and two silver bracelets while he burned to death with his dagger and double-bladed sword beside him.\n\nWang Lun likely failed because he did not make any attempts to raise wide public support. He did not distribute captured wealth or food supplies, nor did he promise to lessen the tax burden. Unable to build up a support base, he was forced to quickly flee all three cities that he attacked in order to evade government troops. Though he passed through an area inhabited by almost a million peasants, his army never measured more than four thousand soldiers, many of whom had been forced into service.\n\nBeginning in 1794, two decades after Wang Lun's failed uprising, a movement also arose in the mountainous region that separates Sichuan from Hubei and Shaanxi in central China as tax protests. Here, the White Lotus led impoverished settlers into rebellion, promising personal salvation in return for their loyalty. Beginning as tax protests, the eventual rebellion gained growing support and sympathy from many ordinary people. The rebellion grew in number and power and eventually, into a serious concern for the government.\n\nA systematic program of pacification followed in which the populace was resettled in hundreds of stockaded villages and organized into militia. In its last stage, the Qing suppression policy combined pursuit and extermination of rebel guerrilla bands with a program of amnesty for deserters. The rebellion came to an end in 1804. A decree from the Daoguang Emperor admitted, \"it was extortion by local officials that goaded the people into rebellion...\" Using the arrest of sectarian members as a threat, local officials and police extorted money from people. Actual participation in sect activities had no impact on an arrest; whether or not monetary demands were met, however, did.\n\nIn the first decade of the nineteenth century, there were also several White Lotus sects active in the area around the capital city of Peking. Lin Qing, another member of the Eight Trigrams sect within the White Lotus, united several of these sects and with them build an organization that he would later lead in the Eight Trigrams Uprising of 1813.\n\nAdministrators also seized and destroyed sectarian scriptures used by the religious groups. One such official was Huang Yupian (), who refuted the ideas found in the scriptures with orthodox Confucian and Buddhist views in \"A Detailed Refutation of Heresy\" ( \"Pōxié Xiángbiàn\"), which was written in 1838. This book has since become an invaluable source in understanding the beliefs of these groups.\n\nWhite Lotus adherents who collaborated with the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War were fought against by the Muslim General Ma Biao.\n\nWhile traditional historiography has linked many Maitreyist and millenarian uprisings during the Ming and Qing dynasties as all related to the White Lotus, there are reasons to doubt that such connections existed. B J Ter Haar has argued that the term \"White Lotus\" became a label applied by late Ming and Qing imperial bureaucrats to any number of different popular uprisings, millenarian societies or \"magical\" practices such as mantra recitation and divination. If this interpretation is correct, the steady rise in the number of White Lotus rebellions in imperial histories during the Ming and Qing does not necessarily reflect the increasing strength of a unified organization. Instead, this trend reflects a growing concern by imperial bureaucrats with any form of Buddhism practiced outside of the sanctioned frameworks of the monasteries.\n\nThe White Lotus sect may have been one of the main ancestors of the Chinese organizations known as the Triads. The Triads were originally members and soldiers of the Tiandihui or \"Heaven and Earth Society\" during the period of the war between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Triads' formation was not for criminal purposes, but to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming to power. The White Lotus Society may have been one of five branches of the Heaven Earth Society which formed at the Shaolin Monastery from Ming loyalists. The Five Branches, known by some as the \"Five Ancestors\", were the Black, Red, White, Yellow and Green Lodges. After there was no longer any need for the triads on the battlefield, some high-level military leaders resorted to criminal activity in order to find means of survival.\n\n\n"}

The airport started as the Casper Army Airfield in September 1942, consisting of four asphalt hard surfaced runways - N/S, NE/SW, E/W, NW/SE - varying in length between 8900' and 8600'.\nCasper AAF was assigned to Second Air Force as a heavy bomber (B-17; B-24) replacement training unit, with the 331st Bombardment Group being the training unit with four squadrons (461st, 462d, 463d and 464th Bombardment) training of personnel in heavy bomber operations. The 331st Combat Crew Training School provided ground instruction. Once personnel completed the training course, they were sent to various combat units overseas as replacement personnel.\n\nThe 331st was converted to a Very Heavy (B-29) group in July 1944 and began training for deployment to Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific. The 211th Army Air Force Base Unit took control of the airfield. Casper AAF became part of Air Transport Command as a transit station for WASP pilots ferrying combat aircraft across the United States. The airfield was inactivated in March 1945, and on 30 September 1945 was turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers as surplus.\n\nThe War Assets Administration turned the airfield over to civil control in the late 1940s, and in 1949 it became \"Natrona County Municipal Airport\", replacing the former Casper Airport, Wardwell Field, whose runways are now streets in the town of Bar Nunn.\n\nWestern Airlines was the first carrier to serve Casper tracing its roots back to 1931 as Wyoming Air Service with a north-south route from Denver to Great Falls, Montana stopping in Cheyenne, Casper, Sheridan, Billings, and Lewiston. Wyoming Air Service changed to Inland Air Lines in 1938 and was merged into Western Airlines in 1952. A new east-west route was then added from Salt Lake City to Minneapolis stopping in Casper, then at Rapid City, Pierre, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota and the north-south route was extended onto Lethbridge and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Aircraft types operated by Wyoming Air Service and Western over the years included Boeing 247, Douglas DC-3, Convair 240 and Douglas DC-6B propliners, and Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops. By 1970 the carrier began operating Boeing 737-200 jetliners on both routes, still making all the stops however the north-south route then terminated at Billings. The north-south route ended in 1979 and the eastern portion of the east-west route extending into Minneapolis ended by 1983, leaving only flights to Salt Lake City and Rapid City. Larger Boeing 727-200 jets were occasionally flown through Casper and in 1987 Western was merged into Delta Air Lines. Delta continued service into Casper with nonstop flights to its Salt Lake City (SLC) hub as well as Rapid City until 1994 when all operations were turned over to SkyWest Airlines operating as the Delta Connection using Embraer 120 turboprops. SkyWest continues to serve Casper today with nonstops to Salt Lake City using Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets.\n\nChallenger Airlines and successor Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) served at Casper from the late 1940s until 1986. In 1950, Frontier was serving the airport with Douglas DC-3 aircraft and by the early 1960s the airline had introduced larger Convair 340 and Convair 580 propliners. By 1970, Frontier began replacing their Convair 580 turboprop flights with Boeing 737-200 jet service primarily to its Denver (DEN) hub as well as to Billings, Bozeman, and Missoula, Montana and Jackson and Riverton, Wyoming. All Frontier service ended when the airline shut down on August 24, 1986.\n\nContinental Airlines began flights in 1980 when this air carrier was operating a hub at Denver and was serving Casper with Boeing 727-200 and Douglas DC-9-10 jetliners. Continental ceased mainline flights in 1985 and turned their respective services over to regional airline partners which operated code sharing flights as Continental Express with various turboprop aircraft types. Continental Express service was operated by Pioneer Airlines (1985-1986), and Trans-Colorado Airlines (1986) with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Continental reinstated mainline service on the Casper-Denver route for a short time in 1986-1987 then Continental Express service returned by Rocky Mountain Airways (1987-1991), and Britt Airways (1991-1994) with Beechcraft 1900C and ATR-42 aircraft. Final Continental representation was by GP Express (1994-1996) with Beechcraft 1900C aircraft. Continental then ended all hub operations at Denver and ceased all service to Casper. Prior to becoming a Continental Express air carrier in 1987, Rocky Mountain Airways served Casper from 1983 through 1985 as an independent airline with de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops.\n\nUnited Airlines began serving Casper in 1984 with nonstop Boeing 727-100, 727-200, and 737-200 jet flights to its Denver hub. In 1987, United mainline jets were replaced with United Express service flown by Aspen Airways (1987-1990) with Convair 580 turboprops and British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jet aircraft, then by Mesa Airlines (1990-1998) with Beechcraft 1900C, de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia aircraft. Air Wisconsin then provided United Express service (1998-2002) with Dornier 328 propjets followed by Great Lakes Airlines (2001-2003) using Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. Great Lakes lost their designation as United Express in 2002 but continued to provide flights to Denver under its own branding. SkyWest Airlines then resumed United Express service in 2003 using Embraer 120 turboprops and later upgrading with Canadair CRJ-200 jets. \n\nNorthwest Airlink, the code-share affiliate carriers operating for Northwest Airlines, served Casper on two occasions. The first was in 1986 with flights to Billings operated by Big Sky Airlines using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner aircraft and then from 2004 through 2009 by Mesaba Airlines with flights to Minneapolis using Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets. Big Sky had been previously serving Casper under their own brand from 1980 through 1986 and returned for a short time in 2003 with flights to Billings, again under their own brand.\n\nAllegiant Airlines served Casper from 2009 through 2017 with two flights per week to Las Vegas using McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.. \n\nFrom the 1970s through the 1990s, several other smaller commuter and regional carriers served Casper for short periods of time including Air US with flights to Denver using the regional airliner version of Grumman Gulfstream I business propjet..\n\nAs a formerly used defense site (FUDS) the Army has had to review sites according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act since 1980. It was not until 2014, that funding became available. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality's main concern is chemical contamination in the area of a former landfill and sewage treatment plant. Together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the US Environmental Protection Agency it is investigating 12 sites.\n\nOn March 31, 1975, Western Airlines Flight 470 overran and veered off the runway into an irrigation ditch. All 99 people survived the incident, with injuries only occurring during evacuation. The National Transportation Safety Board had concluded that the pilot used poor judgement when it came to executing a missed approach.\n\nThe airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 3/21 is 10,165 × 150 ft (3,098 × 46 m) and 8/26 is 8,679 × 150 ft (2,645 × 46 m).\n\nIn the year ending May 31, 2006, the airport had 47,210 aircraft operations, average 129 per day: 60% general aviation, 24% scheduled airline, 14% air taxi and 1% military. 90 aircraft are based at the airport: 51% single-engine, 34% multi-engine, 9% jet and 6% helicopter. The airport is governed by a Board of Trustees with five members, each serving a five-year term.\n\nSkyWest Airlines operates Canadair CRJ 200 regional jets as Delta Connection and United Express. GoJet Airlines operates Canadair CRJ 700 regional jets as United Express.\n\nFedEx operates at a hangar leased by the airport, and receives flights daily from Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx operates Boeing 757-200s and Airbus A300/310s. FedEx Feeder flies Cessna 208s to serve the surrounding cities throughout Wyoming.\n\nTaxi service and car rental agencies are available. Several local hotels offer free shuttle service.\n\nIn the 2011 comedy film \"Bridesmaids\", an airplane makes an emergency landing at the airport to deplane a rowdy flier and her group of friends.\n\n\n\n"}

Moshe was cousin to the future socialist revolutionary Leon Trotsky. The nine-year-old Lev (Trotsky) lived with Moshe and his wife Fanni in their Odessa apartment when Vera was a baby.\n\nVera briefly attended a History and Philology department in Odessa. Her first poems were published in 1910 in local newspapers. In 1910-1914 she lived in Paris and Switzerland; then she moved to Moscow. During the 1920s she worked as a journalist, writing prose, articles, and essays, and traveling across the country and abroad.\n\nDuring World War II she lived in besieged Leningrad where her husband worked as the director at a medical institute. According to her \"New York Times\" obituary, she \"wrote for the newspaper Leningradskaya Pravda and broadcast over Leningrad radio in efforts to keep up the morale and spirit of the hard‐pressed population.\" Much of her poetry and prose during those times is dedicated to the life and resistance of Soviet citizens. In 1946 she received an esteemed government award (\"Gosudarstvennaya premiya SSSR\") for her siege-time poem \"Pulkovskij meridian\" (\"Pulkovo Meridian\"). She was also awarded several medals.\n\nShe translated into Russian such Ukrainian poets, as Taras Shevchenko, and other foreign poets, such as Paul Éluard and Sándor Petőfi.

For instance, there might be a 47c stamp to pay a particular postal rate but there is unlikely to be a 47c coin.\n\nWhere no denomination is shown, it may be because the stamp is deliberately non-denominated to pay the cost of a particular service, or because the stamp is not a postage stamp. It might be a cinderella stamp of some kind such as a poster stamp or charity label.\n\nSometimes a stamp may have its denomination changed by the post office due to local circumstances. For instance, stocks of one value may be overprinted to show a different value due to stock shortages. In cases of hyper-inflation stamps have had their denomination changed by overprinting as existing denominations became worthless. In other cases, changes to the local currency have led to changes in denomination. For instance, when the Ryukyu Islands (at the time a United States protectorate) changed its currency from Yen to Dollars, a number of airmail stamps originally printed with Yen values were overprinted and re-denominated to cents in 1959–1960.\n\nDuring periods of hyperinflation, non-overprinted postage stamps of extraordinary denominations have been issued. As one example, in Hungary, on 15 July 1946 a AP40,000 (Hungarian adópengő) stamp featuring a diesel locomotive was issued. This was the equivalent of 80 quadrillion pengő (P80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)\n\n"}

Their accuracy is not generally under dispute, but since the quantum mechanical models they depend on only take into account electromagnetic interactions between the nucleus and electrons, there may be unforeseen effects which result in a conversion coefficient differing from one that is empirically determined. \n\nInternal conversion coefficients can be looked up from tables, but this is time-consuming. Computer programs have been developed (see the BrIcc Program) which present internal conversion coefficients quickly and easily.\n\nTheoretical calculations of interest are the Rösel, Hager-Seltzer, and the Band, superseded by the Band-Raman calculation called BrIcc.\n\nThe Hager-Seltzer calculations omit the M and higher-energy shells on the grounds (usually valid) that those orbitals have little electron density at the nucleus and can be neglected. To first approximation this assumption is valid, upon comparing several internal conversion coefficients for different isotopes for transitions of about 100 keV.\n\nThe Band and Band-Raman calculations assume that the M shell may contribute to internal conversion to a non-negligible extent, and incorporates a general term (called \"N+\") which takes into account the small effect of any higher shells there may be, while the Rösel calculation works like the Band, but does not assume that all shells contribute and so generally terminates at the N shell.\n\nAdditionally, the Band-Raman calculation can now consider (\"frozen orbitals\") or neglect (\"no hole\") the effect of the electron vacancy; the frozen-orbitals approximation is considered generally superior.\n\n\n"}

He is listed as a founder of the Suez Canal Company.\n\nHaving taken advantage of a sound education that emphasized mathematics, drawing and painting, then having been given some experience at sea through the efforts of his father, Antoine-Marie, a naval officer, charting the coastal waters of Newfoundland, in 1814, aged fifteen. Having passed his entrance exams, young Linant embarked as a naval cadet on the frigate \"Cléopâtre\", engaged on a mission to Greece, Syria, Palestine and Egypt, which he spent making drawings and doing relief mapping. One of the artists attached to the expedition having suddenly died, Linant was commissioned to replace him, drawing sites and ruins in Athens, Constantinople, Ephesus, Akka and Jerusalem. At Jaffa the expedition reached Damiatta by camel caravan, then sailed up the Nile to disembark at Cairo in December. The expedition was completed, but Linant decided not to return to France, and through a recommendation from the comte de Forbin, the expedition's director, briefly entered the service of the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, before setting out on a series of explorations that lasted from 1818 to 1830, which he described later in his \"Mémoires\".\n\nIn 1818–19 he was in lower Nubia, beyond the Cataracts of the Nile. In 1820 he joined the expedition of the French consul general and explorer Bernardino Drovetti to the oasis of Siwa in the Libyan Desert, where the oracle of Ammon had been consulted by Alexander the Great but to which no modern European had penetrated; his drawings illustrated the \"Voyage à l'Oasis de Syouah\", published by E. Jomard (1823). Within a few months he travelled with the Italian Alessandro Ricci to Sinai: the party left Cairo and followed the peninsula's eastern coast, passing through the Wells of Moses, Wadi Gharandel and Khazne Firaoun, to arrive at Maghara, where they made copies of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Their intention to reach Petra was foiled by the insecurity of the area, but in returning to Cairo they passed through Sarbout el-Khadem and sketched its monuments. This first trip to Sinai enabled him to establish contacts with the Bedouin and prepare himself for the successful trip to Petra finally undertaken with Léon de Laborde in 1828.\n\nMeantime he visited the Fayum in 1821, then was sent by the Englishman William John Bankes to the Sudan commissioned to get geographical information and draw the monuments there. He was gone from Cairo thirteen months from June 1821, discovering the ruins at Messaourat and at Naga, only slightly in advance of Frédéric Cailliaud, the first European to reach Meroe.\n\nIn 1824, Linant spent a couple of months in London, where the African Company proposed to support him in a voyage of exploration, as they had supported Burckhardt. After further travels in Nubia and Sudan, in 1827 he set out funded by the Association, to make his way as far up the White Nile as could be, in search of the fabled source of the Nile: tribal hostility forced him back at 13 degrees north latitude. In 1831 the Société de Géographie of Paris commissioned a further attempt, which was postponed by the viceroy, who sent him instead to find the gold mines in Atbai.\n\nIn these travel Linant did not completely lose sight of his early experience in hydrology. In the Sinai in 1822 he had noted the traces of Trajan's canal, and had visited Suez and the peninsula's other lakes, and later he had roamed the Eastern Desert between the Nile and the Red Sea. \"In 1827 and 1828\" he wrote later, \"I returned once more to the Isthmus, which I visited once again and its environs, and it was then that I began the first studies of a project of communication between the two seas.\" These projects he discussed with Laborde as they recrossed the peninsula on the way to Petra in 1828. There is a valley in the Sinai, once his contracts with the African Association were successfully terminated, Linant \"passed more than a year alone with a choice library in order to study seriously and without distractions in order to acquire what I lacked in scientific understanding to take up service with the Egyptian government in the character of an engineer.\"\n\nAt his return to Cairo in 1831 Linant was named chief engineer of the public works of Upper Egypt, a position that associated him in a long and fruitful career with most of the great works of modernizing Egypt's network of irrigation canals, the grand levées along the Nile. By 1837, fully in charge of public works in the Ministry of Public Instruction, he received the title of bey.\n\nAll along, the idea of a communication between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea never left him. From 1830 he was expressing his ideas, first with the consul general of France, then with Ferdinand de Lesseps. In 1841 he submitted a preliminary plan for a canal to the Compagnie Péninsulaire et Orientale and in 1844, set before Lesseps his complete plans. In 1854 Lesseps obtained from the viceroy Muhammad Sa'id the \"firman\" for the canal concession on behalf of the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez, and Linant was named chief engineer, in which capacity he was soon assisted by the French hydraulics engineer Mougel, for Linant continued in charge of public works, as director general (1862), as Minister of Public Works (1869) and member of the viceroy's council.\n\nHe retired in 1869 to write his vast memoir. In June 1873, the viceroy conferred upon him the title of pasha. He died leaving a vast accumulation of notes, memoirs, drawings, most of which remain unedited. A great number of visiting Europeans left their impressions of Linant.\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n"}

The same year, Columbia/SME Records released \"Ultimate\", a greatest hits collection featuring a compilation of remixes and album versions of C+C Music Factory's Sony Music Entertainment singles. Two singles were released in conjunction with the album: \"I Found Love\" (#13 Dance/Club Play), and \"Robi Rob's Boriqua Anthem\" (#29 Dance/Club Play), which featured Spanish-language reggae artist El General.\n\nIn October 1996, Robert Clivillés released an album of new material under the name Robi-Rob's Clubworld. The first single from the project, \"Shake That Body,\" featured emcee Ya Kid K, formerly of Technotronic. The second single, \"Reach,\" was a collaboration with Hex Hector, and featured vocals from longtime C+C vocalist Deborah Cooper. This was the final recording to include piano tracks recorded by the late David Cole.\n\nIn the 2000s, Clivillés worked with the group MVP, releasing two studio albums with the group.\n\nIn 2010, C+C Music Factory reformed, with Eric Kupper stepping in to replace Cole.\n\nIn May 2015, Clivillés made his debut on \"Billboard's\" Hot Dance Club Songs chart with the song \"Set Me Free\", featuring vocals by Kimberly Davis of the band Chic. The music video for \"Set Me Free\" makes reference to Clivillés' father's suicide.\n\nIn 1989, Clivillés and Cole wrote a song titled \"Get Dumb (Free Your Body)\" that was originally performed under the name The Crew, featuring Freedom Williams, and later by Seduction. They allegedly illegally sampled portions of \"The Music Got Me\", which was written by Boyd Jarvis of early-1980s music group Visual. Boyd sued them for copyright infringement in 1990, and demanded $15 million in royalties.\n\nFour years later, Kevin McCord filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Mariah Carey, Cole, Clivillés, and Columbia Records, because, according to McCord, they took parts of his song called \"I Want to Thank You\" and created \"Make It Happen\" out of it without permission. Although the allegations were proven false, McCord eventually accepted a settlement offer of about US$500,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After rising to public attention in 1983 he has since become a household name in Ireland and Britain; he has also had considerable success in the US and Australia. In 2012, he became the first artist to have a different album in the British charts every year for 25 consecutive years.\n\nKnown for his close relationship with his fanbase, and his charismatic and engaging stage presence, O'Donnell's music has been described as a mix of country and Irish folk, and he has sold over ten million records to date. He is widely considered a \"cultural icon\" in Ireland, and is often parodied in the media. Affectionately known as \"Wee Daniel\", O'Donnell is a prominent ambassador for his home county of Donegal.\n\nO'Donnell was born in and brought up in the village of Kincasslagh, in The Rosses district in the west of County Donegal, Ireland. He grew up as the youngest of a Roman Catholic family, with his parents, Julia (née McGonagle born 1919; died 18 May 2014) and Francis O'Donnell, and siblings John (the eldest), Margaret (Margo), Kathleen and James. He has described his upbringing as mostly happy, with the exception of the death of his father after a heart attack when O'Donnell was six years old.\n\nDuring his school years, O'Donnell considered pursuing a career in banking. Despite this, a career in music was also always a possibility. As a youngster, O'Donnell performed in the local religious choir. In 1980, he went to Galway to pursue business studies, however, he never settled down and by Christmas he was in his sister Margo's band. Margo had already forged a successful career in Ireland.\n\nNot getting enough opportunities to perform solos with the band, in 1983 O'Donnell decided to record his own record. On 9 February 1983, he recorded his first single, Johnny McCauley's \"My Donegal Shore\", with £1,200 of his own money, selling all the copies himself. Later that year, he formed his own musical group, Country Fever. After the group disbanded, he formed The Grassroots. In 1985, the manager of the Ritz label, Mick Clerkin, saw him perform and introduced him to Sean Reilly, who remains as his manager to this day.\n\nUnder the management of Reilly, O'Donnell started to sell concerts out in England on a regular basis. According to O'Donnell, by January 1992, he had hit rock bottom with exhaustion. After a three-month recovery break, he returned to the stage, this time at the Point Theatre, Dublin.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, O'Donnell had become a household name across Ireland and Great Britain. He appeared on popular television shows in both countries and won various awards. Among the accolades, O'Donnell was named Donegal Person of the Year in 1989, which he still rates as the best award. He was given the Irish Entertainer of the Year award in 1989, 1992 and 1996. O'Donnell's first chart hit single in the UK was in 1992 with \"I Just Want to Dance With You\" (later covered by George Strait). This also led to his first appearance on \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nDuring his lengthy career, O'Donnell has made friends with his childhood idols, including Cliff Richard and Loretta Lynn. He also forged a close professional relationship with the Irish songstress Mary Duff, who regularly tours with O'Donnell.\n\nO’Donnell had to cancel a series of concerts in Northern Ireland because of death threats from loyalists paramilitary in 1994. The threat was made in a phone call to Daniel O’Donnell's Viking House Hotel in Kincasslagh, County Donegal. The caller said O’Donnell would be killed if he went ahead with four sell out concerts to be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle, County Down.\n\nIn 2002, he was awarded an Honorary (because of his Irish citizenship) MBE for his services to the music industry. He has had twenty UK Top 40 albums as well as fifteen Top 40 singles and has sold 10 million records to date. O'Donnell garnered considerable success in North America, when he starred in seven concert specials on public television stations (PBS) in the United States. He has charted 18 albums in the Top 20 of the U.S. \"Billboard\"'s World Music Album Chart and also has had several entries in the Independent Albums Chart too.\n\nIn 2015, O'Donnell became the first artist to have charted at least one new album in the UK charts for 28 consecutive years (1988–2015), when his latest album \"The Hank Williams Songbook\" entered the UK Artist Albums Chart at number 5.\n\nA Daniel O'Donnell Visitors' Centre was opened in Dungloe in May, 2012, which displays all his gold discs, awards and wedding suit.\n\nIn Autumn 2015, he appeared on \"Strictly Come Dancing\". He was eliminated third; in week 4 of the series.\n\nIn October 2015, Daniel and his wife Majella starred in the first series of their TV programme \"Daniel and Majella's B&B Road Trip\". That series aired on UTV but moved to RTÉ in 2016.\n\nO'Donnell was married, aged 40, on 4 November 2002, to 41-year-old divorcée Majella McLennan from Thurles, whom he met on holiday in Tenerife three years previously. McLennan received an annulment of her previous marriage, by which she had two children (Siobhan and Michael). The couple live in Meenbanad, County Donegal, and spend time at their second home in Tenerife. Daniel is proficient in Irish and presented a show in that language for the broadcaster TG4.\nO'Donnell also has two step-grandchildren - a step-granddaughter, Olivia, and a step-grandson, Archie, who are his wife's grandchildren.\n\nO'Donnell has been involved in many charitable causes for many years, most notably in Romania. He has championed the Romanian Challenge Appeal, a charity that helps orphaned Romanian children re-establish themselves within society. He was involved in urging Irish families to home these young people in Ireland for a period.\n\nO'Donnell is arguably better known for his gentle, soft-spoken personality and clean-cut image, than for his music. Over the years he has attracted vast media attention and there have been many cultural references to the performer. O'Donnell is frequently satirised in Irish and British comedy because of a common supposition that his audience consists mainly of older women. He was parodied as celebrity singer \"Eoin McLove\" in the \"Father Ted\" episode \"Night of the Nearly Dead\", as well as an episode of BBC sketch-show \"Chewin' the Fat\", as an Irish singer named \"Donald O'Daniel\". The comedy show \"Bull Island\" and the radio sketch segment \"Gift Grub\" portrayed him in sketches frequently singing about his \"mammy\". DJ Chris Moyles has parodied O'Donnell on numerous occasions.\n\nO'Donnell is known for his close relationship with his fans and has a meet-and-greet session after almost every concert. He used to host a massive tea party for his fans outside his Donegal home every year. He has expressed a wish to appear in \"Coronation Street\".\n\nHe appeared on \"Martin and Paul's Surf 'n' Turf\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2098680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098680", "title": "Jamena", "text": "Jamena\n\nJamena () is a village located in the municipality of Šid, Srem District, Vojvodina, Serbia. As of 2011 census, it has a population of 950 inhabitants. It is the only place in Serbia that borders both Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina (Republika Srpska).\n\nThe history of the village dates back to Roman times as a military outpost on the river Sava (Savus River) against the Illyrians. The village has been destroyed and resurrected many times in its history. During World War II in 1943, Jamena was burned to the ground by the Croatian Nazi collaborators - the Ustashe. 2500 civilians were brutally murdered in a two-day rampage; there is a monument to the victims in the center of Jamena. The area and the surrounding forests where the scene of Partisan guerilla activity during World War II, there is a monument to the fighters on the side of the road heading towards Jamena near the army barracks. Since 1945, Jamena has flourished as a wealthy agricultural village on the outskirts of Serbia (Vojvodina).\n\nWhen Yugoslavia broke apart in 1991, Jamena lost its direct road to Morović and the rest of Serbia, because the only roads from the village go to Račinovci and Strošinci which are in Croatia. During the Yugoslav wars (1991–1995), the village was practically isolated from the rest of Serbia. The natality rate has been falling steadily and the village has rapidly declined in population. It was bombed in 1999 by Nato forces who killed one civilian. In the last few years, the population has steadied because of the people from abroad who have been working for years in Western Europe and who started building new homes in the village. Nowadays, the village is connected to the rest of Serbia by route 128.\n\n\n\nThe village has a border crossing over the Sava river by ferry into Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) where some locals commute everyday to work in the Bijeljina area. It also borders Croatia, and there was a campaign to re-open the border with Croatia with the village of Strošinci in 2007, but nothing came of it, much to the dismay of residents from both sides of the border.\nThere is a bus service that runs twice daily, in the morning and late afternoon, to the nearby town of Šid, from which people can travel to all major destinations in Serbia and neighbouring countries. Plans are under way to build a bridge over the river Sava to Bosnia and Hercegovina, construction should start in early 2008. To reach Jamena there is only one road from Morović which cuts through the forest and runs for approximately 20 km.\n\nThe football team plays under the name of FK Graničar Jamena (\"graničar\" means \"frontiermen\" in Serbian) and was formed in 1930. It currently competes in the Šid league, the club colors are red and white. Its ground has seating and shelter for about 300 spectators as well as standing areas. Every summer there is a mini pitch football tournament on the local courts in the village center. Other clubs include the \"Sava\" hunting club due to the large amount of game in the surrounding forests; game include deer, wild boar and pheasants. It shares the same forest often referred to as Tito's hunting ground with Morović. The area is also well known as a fishing area due to its close proximity to the Sava river as well as the Bosut river. There is also a ramp for launching boats on the Sava river in Jamena. As the village is located next to the Sava river there is a dedicated area for swimmers and bathers along the bank of the river about 200 meters upstream from the ferry crossing to Bosnia.\n\nThe village is largely agricultural as the soil around Jamena is very fertile, the main crops being corn, soy, wheat. The main stock breed and sold out of the village are hogs which are generally sold to large wholesalers for retail sale. The village contains 4 bars and 4 general stores as well as a local post office and a medical, dental and veterinary clinic.\n\n"}

The American company, based in Carlsbad, California, is the world's largest manufacturer of golf clubs.\n\nCallaway Golf sells its products through golf retailers and sporting goods retailers, through mass merchants, directly online, and through its pre-owned and trade-in services. Callaway Golf licenses its name, trademarks and service marks for golf lifestyle products including golf apparel, golf shoes, golf bags, headwear, watches, rangefinders, practice aids and travel gear.\n\nCallaway Golf also markets products under the Odyssey putter brand, acquired in 1997, as well as Strata and Ben Hogan golf brands picked up following the bankruptcy of Spalding's former golf division in 2003.\n\nCallaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in LaGrange, Georgia, and was a graduate of Emory University. He had previously been successful in the textile and wine industries, and was also an avid golfer. Among his favorite club brands was Hickory Sticks USA, which was known for producing clubs with hickory shafts and steel cores. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz, and Tony Manzoni. When Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they began seeking investors and approached Callaway, who had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. In 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks USA and the company was renamed \"Callaway Hickory Stick USA.\" In 1983, he became the company's president and moved its headquarters to Carlsbad, California where he could be found selling clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for another $400,000. The company's name was changed to its present name in 1988.\n\nIn 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and, through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales, was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. He was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.\n\nIn 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter was named chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and that of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.\n\nIn 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges, constructed from carbon steel with modified U-grooved faces.\n\nIn 1996, Callaway announced development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing the ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company invested $170 million in research and development, and construction of the production facility.\n\nCallaway Golf Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. They settled on only two versions of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a \"complete-performance\" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company's product development objectives as follows: \"We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer.\"\n\nIn 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters. This led to introduction of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.\n\nEly Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996, remaining as Chairman of the Board. Donald H. Dye was named CEO and President. Callaway also continued as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company. In 1998 he again became President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company, but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001. Ron Drapeau assumed his positions.\n\nIn 2003 Drapeau announced the company's intention to purchase Top-Flite Golf and its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Due to competition from Adidas, the acquisition cost Callaway Golf $169 million.\n\nIn 2003, Callaway Golf Staff Professional Annika Sorenstam announced that she would wear shoes from the new Callaway Golf® footwear collection: \"I'm always looking to use the best golf equipment, and that extends to my choice of shoes.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named Chairman and Chief Executive William C.

The main curriculum at all levels includes Language, Arts, Literature, Math, Science, Social Studies, Modern Languages, Information Technology, Physical Education and Health.\nBrazilian\nISC is accredited by MEC as a Brazilian school until Grade 12 and all students are required to use the Brazilian components of the curriculum. The classes of Language, Literature, History of Brazil and Brazilian Geography are taught in Portuguese. The other areas of knowledge are included in the American program.\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nThe school also offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP), an intensive and challenging program designed for 11th and 12th grade students. The IBDP is recognized around the world as a high school qualification for students planning to attend a university on the European continent. As a result of successful completion, students have the opportunity to obtain permanent college credits.\n\nThe US diploma is mandatory for all students; the Brazilian diploma is mandatory for all Brazilian citizens; and the IB diploma is optional.\n\nIn the Early Childhood Center (ECC), children find a place where they are subject to their own experiences and are able to develop emotional and conceptual understanding through experimentation, research and the transformation of the space around them.\n\nIn this way, inspired by the educational approach of Reggio Emilia schools, teachers listen to the students and propose the development of long-term projects, in which they are protagonists of their learning. This allows children to take initiatives and feel encouraged to learn and explore the world around them.\n\nElementary School engage students in active learning to develop learners' skills as well as habits related to character and citizenship.\n\nThe approach to literacy is based on the Reader's and Writer's Workshop, a customized methodology for international schools in which students in grades 5 through 8 apply learning in a meaningful way. In addition, other subjects are taught by hands-on projects that develop in the student the curiosity and the proactivity in relation to the learning process itself.\n\nMiddle School is based on interdisciplinary collaboration, in which different disciplines work together on the same subject. This integration aims to stimulate ethics, independent and enduring learning, critical thinking, and decision-making skills that prepare students for the next phase, High School.\n\nStudents continue to apply Reader's and Writer's Workshop practices in English classes, and use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for the Social Studies curriculum.

It is spoken by the Gelao people in southern China and northern Vietnam. Despite an ethnic population of 580,000 (2000 census), only a few thousand still speak Gelao. Estimates run from 3,000 in China by Li in 1999, of which 500 are monolinguals, to 7,900 by Edmondson in 2008. Edmondson (2002) estimates that the three Gelao varieties of Vietnam have only about 350 speakers altogether.\n\nIn 2009, a book allegedly written in a native Gelao script was found in Guizhou, China, but scholarship reveals it is certainly fake.\n\nLike Buyang, another Kra language, Gelao contains many words which are likely to be Austronesian cognates. (\"See Austro-Tai\".)\n\nAs noted by Li and Zhou, Gelao shares much vocabulary with the Hlai and Ong Be languages, suggesting contact with Pre-Hlai speakers before their migration to Hainan.\n\nZhang Jimin estimated a total of over 10,000 Gelao speakers in the early 1990s, while Li Jinfang places this number at 3,000 in 1999. Jerold A. Edmondson's 2008 estimate is 7,900 speakers. This number is rapidly declining, as the Gelao are intermarrying with the neighboring Han, Bouyei, and Miao. Many Gelao speakers can also speak Bouyei, Zhuang, or Miao, and nearly all can speak local varieties of Chinese. Among Gelao-speaking families, most middle-age Gelao have very limited speaking abilities for Gelao, while much of the younger generation cannot even understand the most simple words and phrases.\n\nA divergent variety of Gelao known as Shuicheng Gelao 水城仡佬语 (also known as Datie Gelao 打铁仡佬语; autonym: \"\") is spoken in Dongkou 洞口村, Houchang Townshp 猴场乡 and Datiezhai 打铁寨, Miluo Township 米箩乡, both located in Shuicheng County, Guizhou Province, China (Li & Yang 2016: 71). The Gelao of Datiezhai reported that they had migrated from Dongkou 4 generations ago. Li & Yang (2016) report that there are only 3 speakers of Shuicheng Gelao left.\n\nThe Mulao number 28,000 people, and are distributed in Majiang, Kaili, Huangping, Duyun, Weng'an, Fuquan, and other counties of southeastern Guizhou. The Mulao of Xuanwei and Jidong villages refer to themselves as the \"Mu\", in Longli village 龙里寨 they call themselves '. The Mulao speak a variety of Gelao, and not the Mulam language of Guangxi, which is also called Mulao. Luo (1997) describes the two Mulao varieties of ' (') in Majiang County and ' in Kaili City. One dialect is represented by the datapoints of Bamaozhai 巴茅寨 and Madizhai 马碲寨 of Xuanwei District 宣威区, Majiang County (Luo 1997:105, 115), and the other by Bailazhai 白腊寨, Lushan Town 炉山镇, Kaili City (Luo 1997:189); the latter is also spoken in Dafengdong 大风洞, Pingliang 平良, and Chong'anjiang 重安江. Mulao data from Majiang and Kaili are also given in Guizhou (1985). also\n\nThe extinct (土蛮语) of Sinan County, Guizhou was a variety of Gelao.\n\nIn Qingzhen City, Gelao is spoken in the following villages (Qingzhen 2004:25-30).\n\nZhou (2004) reports that there are no more than 6,000 Gelao speakers, making up only 1.2% of the total number of ethnic Gelao people. The following table, based on Zhou (2004:150–151), shows the number of Gelao speakers in each county as of the 1990s. All counties are in Guizhou province unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe Gelao people in the following counties do not speak any form of the Gelao language whatsoever, and have shifted entirely to Southwestern Mandarin.\n\nThe most endangered variety, Red Gelao of Vietnam, is spoken by only about 50 people. Many speakers have shifted to Southwestern Mandarin or Hmong. The Red Gelao people, who call themselves the ', send brides back and forth among the villages of Na Khê and Bạch Đích (or Bìch Đich) in Yên Minh District, Hà Giang Province, Vietnam and another village in Fanpo, Malipo County, Yunnan, China (autonym: ') in order to ensure the continual survival of their ethnic group. Edmondson (1998) reports that there are also Red Gelao people in Cán Tí, Quản Bạ District and Túng Sán, Hoàng Su Phì District who no longer speak any Gelao, and speak Hmong, Tay, or Vietnamese instead. Hoang (2013:12) reports that there also some Red Gelao in Vĩnh Hảo commune, Bắc Quang District who had moved from Túng Sán commune. However, the White Gelao of Phố La Village and Sính Lủng Village of Dồng Văn District still speak the White Gelao language.\n\nGelao is not well documented, having only been studied by a few scholars such as Li Jinfang, Jerold A. Edmondson, Weera Ostapirat, and Zhang Jimin. The three varieties in Vietnam are not mutually intelligible, and three varieties in China may be distinct languages as well. \"Ethnologue\" classifies Gelao as four languages, perhaps as closely related to the two Lachi languages as they are to each other.\n\nOstapirat (2000) proposed three major subdivisions for Gelao, with a total of 17 varieties. The Central and Southwestern branches shares various phonological innovations, suggesting an initial split with the Northern branch. Some varieties cited are also from Jerold A. Edmondson (2008). Edmondson also proposes that Red Gelao of the China-Vietnam border may in fact constitute a separate primary branch of Gelao.\n\nCentral (Gao)\n\nNorthern (Red Gelao)\n\nSouthwestern (White and Green Gelao)\n\nZhang Jimin (1993) recognizes the following subdivisions of Gelao.\n\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages\" (2007), based on information from He (1983), groups Gelao into five subdivisions.\n\n\nThe most extensively studied varieties are the Wanzi and Zhenfeng dialects, while the most endangered one is Red Gelao.\n\nZhou (2004) lists four dialects of Gelao.\n\n\nWei Mingying (2008:45) classifies the Gelao dialects as follows.\n\n\nWei (2008: 39-40) classifies the A'ou (Red Gelao) dialects as follows.\n\nWei (2008: 39) considers Houzitian 猴子田 Red Gelao to be most closely related to the Gelao variety of Longjiazhai 龙家寨, northern Zhijin County. There are only about 10 ethnic Gelao households in Houzitian. The Gelao speakers of \"Donie\" \"\" village, Aga Township 阿嘎乡, Shuicheng County 水城县 originally migrated from Houzitian several decades ago; there are only a few elderly rememberers of that variety left.\n\nAndrew Hsiu (2013) classifies the Gelao dialects as follows.\n\nGelao has many uvular and prenasalized consonants. Many varieties also preserve consonant clusters that have been lost in most other related languages. These consonant clusters, such as , correspond regularly with consonants in Lachi, Mulao, Qabiao (Pubiao), Buyang, and various Kam–Tai languages. Gelao also shares many phonological features with Bouyei and other neighboring non-Kra languages.\n\nMany Gelao varieties have a total of six tones, including two level tones (' and '), two rising tones (' and '), and two falling tones (' and ').\n\nSound correspondences between the Liuzhi (六枝) and Zhenfeng (贞丰) varieties include:\n\n[Liuzhi : Zhenfeng]\n\nLike all of its surrounding languages, Gelao is a head-first, SVO language. Like Buyang, one unusual feature of Gelao is that negatives usually come at the end of a sentence. Reduplication is very common and is used for diminutive or repetitive purposes. Other common features include the use of serial verb constructions and compound nouns. Although numerals and classifiers precede nouns, adjectives (including demonstratives) always follow the noun. Function words, such as prepositions and auxiliary words, are often derived from verbs.\n\nLike Buyang and Dong, Gelao retains many prefixes that have been lost in most other Kra–Dai languages. Zhang (1993:300) notes that the Moji (磨基) Longlin variant makes especially extensive use of prefixing syllables before nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These prefixes are especially important for reconstruction purposes.\n\nMany words in Gelao are derived from vernacular Southwest Mandarin Chinese. These loanwords are often used interchangeably with native Gelao words. There is also a highly rich system of classifiers.\n\nGelao also has a rich set of pronouns not attested in other Kra–Dai languages. There are also pronouns referring to one's household in particular. The following are pronouns from Pingba Gelao.\n\n\nPingba Gelao numerals are given below. Note the similarities with the Austronesian numeral system.\n\n\n\nWord lists\n"}

The screenplay is written by Lenore J. Coffee based on a novel by Stuart Engstrand.\n\nThe film marks Davis' last appearance as a contract actress for Warner, after eighteen years with the studio. She tried several times to walk away from the film (which only caused the production cost to go through the roof), but Warner refused to release her from their employment contract. She remembered the project as \"a terrible movie\", and her death scene at end in the film as \"the longest death scene ever seen on the screen\".\n\nRosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people.\n\nFor over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city.\n\nLewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down.\n\nDuring a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will. To prevent that eventuality, she shoots and kills Moose during the hunt. She is acquitted of this act by claiming she thought he was a deer.\n\nTo Rosa's consternation, Latimer wants to avoid \"any dirt\" associated with them and Moose's demise; he suggests they wait \"a month or so\" before they go through with their plans. At home, Lewis assumes that Rosa will come to feel good about having a baby, but Latimer's change of plans, and her inherent resentment of the pregnancy, drives her to confess both her affair with Latimer and that she deliberately murdered Moose. Lewis says that he only cares about his baby and that after she gives birth, she can go where ever she pleases.\n\nFrom his office window, Lewis happens to see Rosa boarding a bus. He follows her to a neighboring town where she is sitting in a 'lawyer's office'; she reluctantly leaves with him but, on the way home, tricks him into stopping their car and going to the trunk.\n\nShe gets out of the vehicle and throws herself down an embankment, desperate to abort. The result is peritonitis and a raging fever which makes her delirious. She enlists Jenny, her housekeeper, to help her dress and she leaves the house to catch the train to Chicago. Near the tracks, she collapses and dies.\n\n\nThe scenes featuring the mythical town of \"Loyalton, Wisconsin\" were actually shot in Loyalton, California, a small, picturesque village in Sierra County.\n\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther dismissed the film upon its release, writing,To be sure, the script by Lenore Coffee offers little for her to do but run through the usual banalities of an infidelity yarn ... For those who have not been embarrassed by pretensions in a fairly long time, let us recommend the climax of this incredibly artificial film—the final scene in which the lady, apparently burning up with a bad case of peritonitis, drags herself out of bed, pulls herself to her mirror, smears make-up on her face and gets dressed in disheveled finery to stagger forth toward the railroad tracks and death. With the clashing refrain of 'Chicago' beating in her head, she pays for her selfish sins and follies. Quite an experience, we'd say ... Not to be coy about it, we can see no 'Oscars' in the offing for this film.\n\nWriting in 2004, Dennis Schwartz was nearly as dismissive, summarizing the plot as \"bombastic melodrama\", but noting that, \"The film's only redeeming value is in its almost camp presentation, which might find some in the audience entertained by the overblown acting on Bette's part (she caricatures herself) and the intense but laughable soap opera story.\" In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.\n\nThe film originally received a ‘C’ classification from the Legion of Decency because of its abortion elements. This classification initially impacted the film’s box office, forcing the studio to negotiate cuts in order for the film to be reclassified as a ‘B.’\n\n\"Variety\" said the film earned $1.5 million.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros accounts the film earned $1,331,000 domestically and $407,000 foreign.\n\nComposer Max Steiner was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture) in 1950.\n\nThe film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n"}

These strong radar echoes are associated with the extremely cold temperatures that occur above continental Antarctica during the summer. Rocket and radar measurements indicate that a partial reflection from a multitude of ion layers and constructive interference causes at least some of the PMSE.\n\nGenerally PMSE exhibits dramatic variations in height and intensity as well as large variations in Doppler shift. PMSE exhibit strong signal power enhancements of scattering cross section at VHF radar frequencies in the range 50 MHz to 250 MHz, at times even to over 1 GHz, that occur in summer at high latitudes. The peak PMSE height is slightly below the summer mesopause temperature minimum at 88 km, and above the noctilucent cloud (NLC) and/or polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) layer at 83–84 km. The usual instrument for observing PMSE is a VHF Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar, although LIDARs and sounding rockets have also been used. \n\nPMSE is believed to be caused by structural irregularities in the ionospheric electron density at lower altitudes. The exact cause of PMSE is not yet known, although theorists have proposed steep electron density gradients, heavy positive ions, dressed aerosols, gravity waves and turbulence as possible explanations.\n\nPMSE occurs in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and is sometimes accompanied by noctilucent clouds.\n\n\n"}

Elsa Lanchester and Harry Morgan, in an early film role, also appear. Noel Neill has an uncredited part as an elevator operator very early in the film.\n\nThe film opens with George Stroud (Ray Milland), editor-in-chief of \"Crimeways\" magazine, hiding from building security inside the \"big clock\". The clock is the largest and most sophisticated clock ever built; it dominates the lobby of the Janoth Publications building in New York City, where he works.\n\nThe film flashes back to thirty-six hours earlier. Stroud is eager to go on a long-postponed honeymoon in Wheeling, West Virginia, with his wife Georgette (Maureen O'Sullivan) and son. His tyrannical boss, Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton) wants him to stay and follow up on a missing persons story Stroud has just cracked, but Stroud refuses and Janoth fires him. Stroud goes to a bar to drink and is distracted by the attentions of Janoth's glamorous mistress, Pauline York (Rita Johnson), who proposes a blackmail plan against Janoth. When Stroud loses track of time and misses their scheduled train, Georgette angrily leaves for Wheeling without him. Stroud spends the evening drinking and going out on the town with York at various locations, buying a painting and a sundial.\n\nStroud and York go to York's apartment, but she sees Janoth arriving, and Stroud leaves. Janoth sees someone leaving but does not recognize Stroud in the dark. Janoth assumes York is cheating on him, leading to a quarrel which ends with him striking York with the sundial and killing her. Janoth goes to his assistant, Hagen (George Macready), and tells him what happened, intending on going to the police and confessing. But Hagen talks him out of it and convinces him that they can frame the man Janoth saw leaving York's apartment for the crime. Janoth decides to use the resources of \"Crimeways\" to find the man instead of calling the police.\n\nStroud has since caught up with his wife and son in West Virginia and tells her that he has been fired (but leaves out his adventures with York). Janoth calls to re-hire him, to lead the effort to find the mystery man (leaving out any mention of York). He mentions enough details for Stroud to know that the mystery man is himself. He reluctantly agrees to return to his job and lead the manhunt, to Georgette's disappointment.\n\nDuring the manhunt, Stroud has to appear to lead the investigation diligently, and at the same time, prevent the investigation from identifying him as its target. Meanwhile, he must also secretly carry out his own investigation to prove Janoth's guilt.\n\nEventually York is identified by the \"Crimeways\" team and witnesses are found that saw her out on the town with the mystery man. These witnesses are brought to the Janoth Building.\n\nOne is eccentric artist Louise Patterson (Elsa Lanchester), who did the painting that was purchased by Stroud. Asked to paint a portrait of the mystery man, she produces a modernist abstract of blobs and swirls.\n\nStroud tries to avoid the witnesses, but one of them sees and recognizes him as the mystery man. Stroud slips away before the witness points him out to the investigators, but now the investigators know that the mystery man is in the building, though not who he is. All exits from the building are sealed, and everyone must leave by the main door, with the witnesses watching for the mystery man. Building security men sweep the building to flush out the wanted man.\n\nStroud evades the dragnet by various maneuvers, finally hiding in the clock (ending the flashback segment of the film).\n\nIn the climax of the film, Stroud confronts Janoth and Hagen. He presents evidence which appears to point to Hagen as the killer. Hagen implores Janoth to clear him, but Janoth tells him only that he will provide him the best possible legal defense. Enraged, Hagen turns on Janoth and reveals that Janoth killed York and he helped cover it up. Janoth shoots Hagen and flees. Janoth tries to escape in an elevator, but the elevator car is stuck floors below (jammed there by Stroud earlier while evading the security men); Janoth falls down the elevator shaft to his death.\n\nMorgan's screen name later would become \"Henry 'Harry' Morgan\" and eventually Harry Morgan, to avoid confusion with the popular humorist of the same name.\n\nParamount bought the rights to the novel before publication. (Fearing's earlier novel \"The Hospital\" had been a best seller.) The purchase price was a reported $45,000.\n\nJonathan Latimer was assigned to write the script and Ray Milland to star. Leslie Fenton was announced as director but he was held up on \"Saigon\" so John Farrow took over. Filming began February 17, 1947. Charles Laughton was cast as the villain.\n\nThis was Maureen O'Sullivan's first film in five years, since \"Tarzan's New York Adventure\", after which she had concentrated on raising her family. She did it as a favor for her husband, director John Farrow.\n\nFilm critic Bruce Eder wrote, \"\"The Big Clock\" is a near-perfect match for the book, telling in generally superb visual style a tale set against the backdrop of upscale 1940s New York and offering an early (but accurate) depiction of the modern media industry.\"\n\nIn 1998 film writer David N. Meyer wrote, \"More screwball comedy than noir, \"The Big Clock's\" big moments derive from snappy dialogue and over-the-top humor.\" Dennis Schwartz wrote in 2004 that \"John Farrow directs this thrilling psychological film noir with style, though it's barely a work of noir in the full sense of that genre.\"\n\nIn 2001, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills.\n\nThe film was very well received by critics and as of March 19, 2020, holds a 100% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.\n\nThe story was remade in 1976 as \"Police Python 357\" and in 1987 as \"No Way Out\" with Kevin Costner. The 1948 film is closer to the novel. The 1976 remake, on the other hand, updated the events to the Orleans Police Department in France, wherease the 1987 remake updated the events to the United States Department of Defense in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War.\n\n\n"}

Written by Romantics members Wally Palmar, Mike Skill and Jimmy Marinos in 1979, the song is included on the band's self-titled debut album (1980), and was also released as a single in late 1979. Marinos, the band's drummer, is the lead vocalist on the song. The band filmed a music video for the song that appeared frequently on MTV during the early 1980s.\n\n\"What I Like About You\" was written by Palmar, Marinos and Skill around a guitar part by Skill. The song's \"Hey, uh-huh-huh\" refrain was influenced by the Yardbirds' \"Over Under Sideways Down\" and Chuck Berry's \"Back in the U.S.A.\". The song's riff is slightly similar to Neil Diamond's \"Cherry, Cherry\", the Standells 1966 hit \"Dirty Water\", and Joe Jackson's 1979 single \"I'm the Man\". The Romantics recorded the song and the accompanying album at Coconuts Recording Studio in Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nWhen first released, \"What I Like About You\" was already a popular song on the Romantics' concert playlist. In terms of record sales and radio airplay, however, the song was only a moderate success at the time of its release, reaching only number 49 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was most successful in Australia, where it reached number two on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report) for two weeks and became the 13th most successful single for 1980. It was only towards the end of the 1980s, after the song had been licensed for use in television commercials for Budweiser beer, that \"What I Like About You\" grew to become one of the most popular rock anthems of all time.\n\nIn November 2007, The Romantics filed a federal lawsuit against Activision, the publisher of \",\" claiming that the video game manufacturer had infringed on the band's rights by featuring a soundalike recording of \"What I Like About You\" in the game. The Romantics lost their case in December 2007, with the judge stating that Activision had taken all the necessary steps in developing its product.\n\nMichael Morales released a version of \"What I Like About You\" in 1989, as the follow-up to his hit \"Who Do You Give Your Love To\". His version reached number 28 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, eclipsing the position of the original version.\n\nThe song was covered by Australian rock band 5 Seconds of Summer for their 2014 \"She Looks So Perfect\" EP, reaching number 137 on the UK Singles Chart. The studio mix of the song is included on the group's 2014 live album, \"LiveSOS\", and was serviced to American mainstream radio on December 2, 2014 as its lead single. It received strong airplay for the week ending December 28, 2014 and debuted on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs chart, where it has since peaked at number 30.\n\nThe band performed the song live at the 2014 American Music Awards on November 23, 2014 ahead of its release.\n\nA lyric video for the live version was uploaded to 5 Seconds of Summer's Vevo account November 23, 2014, the same day as their AMA performance.

{"id": "2098753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098753", "title": "Bulusan, Sorsogon", "text": "Bulusan, Sorsogon\n\n', officially the ', (Bisakol: \"Banwaan sa Bulusan\"); ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is bordered by the towns of Barcelona in the north and, going counterclockwise, the towns of Casiguran, Juban, Irosin and Santa Magdalena. The islets of San Bernardino, about off the coast, fall under the jurisdiction of Bulusan.\n\nBulusan is politically subdivided into 24 barangays; 8 of them are in the Poblacion area.\n\nLong before the Spaniards arrived, the natives of Bulusan were living in organized though scattered settlements. Some lived in what used to be Inarado (now Licod or San Rafael), others in Ilihan, some in Pinayagan, and still a number lived in Capangihan — a place near the Paghasaan and Bayugin Rivers. These settlements are distant from the seacoast and upland. The reason could be the presence of Moro pirates who used to attack the town, especially the coastal areas, robbing the natives of their gold and whatever else came to be lying around, and burning the houses afterwards. Due to these Moro-related disasters, it was a wise move to locate the settlements on higher ground.\n\nRecent excavations yielded artifacts such as platters, jugs, plates, and vases made from china and earthen burial jars in what used to be Inarado. These finds further strengthened some claims that the Chinese and the people in this part of the country were already engaged in trade even before the 'Cross & Sword' reached them.\n\nBulusan, like the rest of Sorsogon, was part of the province of Albay till October 17, 1894. In Inarado, the fourth \"parroquia\" (parish) of the present Province of Sorsogon, was established in 1630. After being merely a part of Casiguran (established in 1600), Bulusan became an independent parish following Bacon (established in 1617) and the parish of Sorsogon (established in 1628). It became a separate \"pueblo civil\" (town) in 1631. The new parish was then placed under the tutelary of St. James, the Greater — the patron saint of Spain. Fr. Miguel de Santa Ana became its first parish priest, exercising one-man authority over ecclesiastical and civil functions. The people also selected the first executive of the place, a \"gobernadorcillo\".\n\nIn 1760, the town was transferred from Inarado to its present site at the mouth of Bulusan River. This was triggered by the need to trade with neighboring settlements. The relocation was done through the efforts of Fr. Joaquin de los Santos, the parish priest. Under the friar's guidance, the people chose Bernardino Pasion as first head of the town. The natives started building a church in the place where a new one now stands. This initial development formed the nucleus of the present \"poblacion\" (town center).\n\nThe Bulusan parish then encompassed all lands that includes the vicinities of Gubat, Matnog, Bulan, Barcelona and Santa Magdalena. Eventually, either new parishes were born out of the Mother parish and became a town of its own or these communities grew into separate towns of their own and, in turn, established their own parishes. See table below:\n\nBulusan's watchtowers are believed to have been built around 1760, the year that the town's \"poblacion\" was transferred to its present site. In 1799, as a defense and warning measure against the Moro pirates, the \"principalias\" (leaders) of the coastal towns of Albay convened in their respective town halls and drew up plans for the building of \"lanchas cañoneras\" (armed ships). On April 20, 1799, Bulusan's leaders decided to build two \"lanchas cañoneras\" to be commanded by actual gobernadorcillo Don Juan Macsimiano and ex-gobernadorcillo Don Juan Tomas.\n\nThe town of Bulusan built the most \"baluartes de piedra\" (stone watchtowers). The town erected watchtowers, one each in Macabare, Tawog and Layog (now a part of Barcelona).\n\nNear the community of Dapdap, a bigger triangular \"muralla\" [fortification] called Punta Diamante which encloses the church and rectory of the parish of St. James the Greater was erected. Punta Diamante has five watchtowers with high, thick walls, making it an ideal place for refuge during Moro attacks. Unlike the other watchtowers which are cylindrical and have circular bases, the one facing the sea is of a triangular plan, a smaller version of the main complex. The biggest watchtower has an octagon shaped base (with eight sides) and tapers upward in alternating tiers. This watchtower now serves as the church's bell tower, with the old bells comparably intact.\n\nAmong the province's other towns, Bulusan was comparatively well-off. Being a major port of \"armadillas\" (small ships) patrolling the high seas — equivalent to present-day Philippine Coast Guard — it was well protected from the Moro pirates. As a consequence, people from other towns came, earned their living, and paid tributes to the Spanish Government. In 1809, when the governor of Albay ordered the construction of a cemetery outside each town, Bulusan reported the highest construction cost (200 pesos) in a display of its considerable wealth.\n\nSpain's control over the \"Buluseños\" — the locals of Bulusan — and the rest of the natives throughout the islands brought a significant change in their community life. They were made to embrace Catholic faith more by force than by conviction. \"Polos y servicios\" (forced labor) was widely used especially in the building of buildings like churches and rectories with its dungeons, and the \"casa tribunal\" (town hall). It could be presumed that a forced labor was likewise employed in the construction of Punta Diamante and the other watchtowers.\n\nBulusan had its own share of heroes in the revolution against Spain. These same individuals would later find themselves in the war against the Americans. Colonel Emeterio Funes, a Buluseño, was one of the foremost revolutionary leaders in the province. Coming home from a military service under General Miguel Malvar, he was aware of the immediate plans of the Americans to invade the rest of the country. Upon his arrival in Bulusan, he met with the town's prominent figures, with the parish priest in attendance, in the church rectory. Together, they drew up plans for a revolutionary movement in the province. In 1900, Emeterio Funes was appointed colonel of the revolutionary forces in Sorsogon by General Vito Belarmino of Albay.\n\nThe revolutionary forces in the province had been quite a success, what with the natives and the elected officials on their side. On April 25, 1900, the Americans waged a battle with the Filipino revolutionaries in Sitio Boco, San Francisco. The Americans suffered three casualties: one lieutenant was killed and two soldiers were wounded. Meanwhile, only two soldiers were wounded on the defender's side. Due to lack of ammunition, the revolutionaries were unable to make a second attack and had to flee to safety. The Americans, enraged with the loss of a comrade and the failure to capture Colonel Funes, later on burned the entire town. After two years of effective resistance, on February 21, 1901, Colonel Funes took the oath of allegiance to the United States in a ceremony done in Bulan. Knowing that the inhabitants were getting weary of the war, he decided to end it peacefully.\n\nUnder the Americans, the first municipal president was Braulio Ganzo. However, the first local executive elected in Bulusan by popular suffrage was Juan Fortades.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1940, Bulusan experienced major developments in education, government, communication, agriculture, and public health. From the very start of the American regime, free public instruction commenced. Public schools in almost all barrios were opened. In 1927, the municipal building (now housing the post office, court room, and municipal jail) and public market (undergoing another major renovation — this time a vertical development) were built. In 1930, the provincial road connecting Bulusan to the adjoining towns of Barcelona and Irosin was opened to traffic. Telegraph and mail services began. Qualified voters began enjoying the right to suffrage. A system of municipal government was instituted. Trade and commerce flourished. Development in agricultural methods was initiated. In public health, cholera and smallpox were contained. In 1939, the first municipal waterworks system was constructed.\n\nAt about this period, two Buluseños rose to places of prominence. Juan S. Reyes was elected governor of Sorsogon (1929–1931). His younger brother, Dr. Jose S. Reyes, who obtained his doctorate degree from Columbia University, was elected delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Referred to as a political genius, he contributed immensely in the drafting of the 1935 Constitution. He also became a member of the Philippine Independence Mission and was the Secretary of Education of both the Quirino and Osmeña administrations. In 1945, he became executive secretary to President Sergio Osmeña.\n\nThis period of relative peace and prosperity in Bulusan was disturbed when the Second World War broke out in the Philippines on December 8, 1941. Like the rest of the islands, Bulusan was overrun by the Japanese Imperial Army. This triggered nationalism once more among Buluseños with the re-emergence of organized guerilla resistance. The Japanese later succeeded in establishing a semblance of local government to administer the town, but the loyalty of those appointed to these positions remained with the resistance group.\n\nBulusan people are speakers of the Bisakol language. Pure Bicol is spoken in some special occasions and in Roman Catholic church liturgies. Tagalog is considered the third language, parallel to English.\n\nRoman Catholicism comprises 90% of the population. There are members of Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehova's Witnesses, Church of Jesus of the Latter Day Saints, born-again Christians and other fundamental denominations in the town.\n\nBulusan is home to the highest peak in Sorsogon, Mount Bulusan. This active volcano is the centerpiece of Bulusan Volcano Natural Park which covers a land area of 3,672 hectares. At the foot of the mountain is the equally popular Bulusan Lake, a scenic crater lake surrounded by a dense green forest and encircled by a concrete pathway. The lake is about 30 minutes drive through a paved winding road from the Bulusan town proper.\n\nBulusan, which means \"where water flows\", is home to several springs and waterfalls that originate from the mountains of the National Park.\n\n\n\nAnother Buluseño, Augusto Ortiz, rose to become provincial executive from 1968 to 1971. From the judiciary, he was tapped governor of Sorsogon anew by President Marcos (1977) but had to relinquish the post when he was elected to the Interim Batasang Pambansa in 1978. In 1984, he was elected as Mambabatas Pambansa until 1986 when it was dissolved. During his term, the Bulusan Cultural and Sports Center was constructed in what used to be the site of the old Central School's Gabaldon building. Two municipal streets in Barangay Sabang and Madlawon were likewise constructed.\n\nThe '80s also marked the birth of Damayan Buluseño, Inc. (DBI), an organization of Buluseños living in Metro Manila. The group provides assistance to and development opportunities among Buluseños, like employment opportunities, medical assistance for the poor, scholarship, relief and financial assistance for the development of Bulusan. Starting out as a loose group out to muster support for a town mate undergoing trial in Manila but whom they believed was wrongly accused, DBI went on to become a duly registered organization which, with its heretofore unseen zeal and popular support, became one of the province's most active organizations under the leadership of its founding president, Rogelio F. Fuentes. To date, it continues to fulfill its vision and provides an avenue for community leadership, pride in the hometown, brotherhood, and prosperity as ideals worthy of pursuit.\n\nBulusan Central School (founded in 1903) by the American Thomasites, is the town's pilot elementary school. It was first housed in the Gabaldon building (the town's old \"casa tribunal\"). When the enrollment steadily increased through the years, several private houses were used as annexes, until the school was eventually transferred to a spacious property in Barangay Poctol, also in the \"poblacion\", where Emeterio Funes Street now runs. The Gabaldon building itself (or at least the upper storey) was totaled by Typhoon Dinang in December 1981. Assemblyman Augusto Ortiz had the old stone walls demolished and built Bulusan Cultural and Sports Center on the vacated lot.\n\nOther elementary schools:\n\n\nImmaculate Heart of Mary School (IHMS) - Bulusan, on the other side of Punta Diamante, is a Franciscan-operated elementary and secondary school.\n\nBulusan National Vocational Technical School is one of the country's top-performing TESDA schools. It started out as a municipal high school founded by Jose Geñorga, who was TESDA Vocational School Administrator II (VSA II) when he retired. The school now caters to students from the 2nd District of Sorsogon.\n\n"}

The language is also spoken in four towns of Albay and some parts of Pilar and Castilla, Sorsogon. It is mutually intelligible with Western Miraya. People of Donsol can also speak and understand Tagalog or Filipino, the national language, and English.\n\nSince the majority of the people adhere to Catholicism, each barangay has a patron saint and fiestas are held annually. Iglesia ni Cristo is the second largest religion of the population and has several local congregations in the municipality.\n\nSwimming with whale sharks, locally known as \"butanding\", was featured as the \"Best Animal Encounter in Asia\" by \"Time\" magazine in 2004. Whale sharks can be seen between November and June, with presence peaking between February and May.\n\nThe presence of whale sharks in the town of Donsol was known to the local residents over 100 years. But the locals believed these gentle giants were dangerous. This wrong notion changed when in December 26, 1997, a group of scuba divers led by Romir Aglugub – a PADI diving instructor, discovered its presence, and interacted and came in contact with the whale sharks. Even the members of the diving group of Romir was having second thought if the fish is docile, until the instructor led the way into the water and came in contact with the whale shark. Copy of video footage taken by the group was passed on to the media and the WWF-Philippines. By March 1998, Donsol became world-class tourist destination and now known as the “Whale Shark Capital of the World”.\nInteraction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local Department of Tourism (DOT) office. WWF guidelines are generally observed to protect the sharks. Rules include limiting the number of swimmers per boat to six, no scuba divers and staying further than three meters from the sharks.\n\nIn recent years the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. The females that are seen are generally large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propeller marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats in the main February–June tourist season.\n\nIn 2006 five sharks were found dead on the surface, within 30 miles of Donsol. They had all been shot at close range. One shark had 13 bullet wounds to the head. The locals blame this on commercial fishermen shooting the sharks if they are caught in their nets. Manta rays, which are also protected in the Philippines, are also over fished and sold in local markets in the Sorsogon area.\n\nGroups from Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines make up the largest groups of visitors. Most book guided tours with dive centers familiar with whale shark interaction.\n\nBicolano delicacies are plentiful in Donsol. Bicolano cuisine is well known for dishes cooked in \"gata\" or coconut cream. A famous dish to try is \"laing\" or \"gabi\", which is dried taro leaves cooked in coconut cream with cuts of meat or fish. Another famous Bicolano dish available in Donsol is \"Bicol Express\" which is pork stir fried with shrimp paste, heavy coconut cream and green chilli peppers. It is a spicy dish that is best eaten with hot, steamed rice. A Filipino favourite is a dish called Sisig. Sisig is deep fried pork simmered in Calamansi juice, salt, pepper and chilli peppers. It is eaten with hot, steamed rice or as a bar snack. There are a few restaurants in Donsol that serve these dishes.\n\nTourism continues to develop piecemeal in Donsol. The first hotel established in the area is the Amor Farm Beach Resort in 1997 followed by the Woodland Beach Resort in 1998 which started off as a family vacation house. Interest to visit the quaint and quiet town grew as soon as news of whale shark sightings grew amongst the international marine biologist community. Tourists can now avail of rooms that cater to all financial budgets, from the backpacker to the family vacationer from various resorts and homestays in Donsol.\n\nMost establishments accept only cash, but there is an ATM in Donsol located inside the Municipal Town Hall. There are already several resorts that accept credit cards. Giddy's Place PADI Dive Resort in the town center and Elysia Beach Resort in Dancalan are two of them. Landlines are non existent in Donsol and most rely on mobile phones. Internet service just came to Donsol in 2008 using cellular technology. There are a few internet shops in town.\n\nDonsol has a not so known but equally unique night firefly tour and shrimp-catching night tour available all-year round. Donsol is also becoming the best jump-off and base for divers to the Manta Bowl and San Miguel Island in Ticao due to the existence of better tourist facilities than the other rural towns. Diving in Donsol itself is not allowed. Donsol also has great trekking and biking site due mainly to the abundance of hilly areas and fields.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nGubat is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. The people who live here speak the Gubat language which is also a dialect of Waray-Waray of Eastern Visayas, a Southern Sorsoganon sub-language and they were called Gubatnons.\n\nGubat is in the south-eastern part of Luzon Island, along the coast of the Pacific Ocean on the Bicol Peninsula. It is the third largest town in the province of Sorsogon. It is divided into 2 districts: the North District and South District.\n\nGubat is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.\n\nBarangays with (Poblacion) indicate that barangay is part of the town proper or poblacion\n\nGubat was originally a big barrio of Bulusan, inhabited by a few Tagalogs, Visayans and Albayanons who travelled on foot to hunt wild animals. These people built their homes close to the shore and called their location Buri, which today is the barrio of Buenavista. In 1764, Gubat finally became a town with Don Pedro Manook, the first Teniente del Barrio, also becoming the first gobernadorcillo. The town proper is named after Don Pedro Manook. \n\nThe word \"gúbat\" means forest in Tagalog. However, the name applied to the town is derived from the verb \"guinobat\", a term used by the natives which means \"raided\". In the early days when Christians and Muslims were constantly at odds, Muslim pirates would come in from the southern seas to raid the town. Because of the frequent raids, the town was referred to as \"guinobat\" which eventually became \"Gubat\". Legend has it that during one of those raids, the pastor along with the townspeople held up a statue of St. Anthony to ward off the attack, praying for a miracle. In one account, it was said that the child Jesus in St. Anthony's arms drove back the pirates. St. Anthony of Padua became the town's patron saint and his feast day is lavishly celebrated as an official parish and town holiday every 13 June.\n\nThe town settlers had to move a number of times before finally deciding to settle at a place they considered safe and peaceful. Eventually, they began to expand, laying out permanent streets, the first of which are what we now know as Luna and Calderon Streets.\n\nThe main parish church itself has an interesting history. In 1768, the people decided to build a church. The locals, being poor, urged the town captain, Don Juan Bonifacio, to require all men to contribute one cubic meter of \"talaksan\" (coral stone) apiece. It took ten years of preparation and it was not until 1778 that construction finally started.\n\nAlthough it has since undergone several renovations, the church foundation is still the original one built in 1778. The rectory is the oldest and one of the only two remaining rectories dating back that far in the entire Bicol region.\n\nIn November 2006, Gubat became the site of a scientific expedition by astronomers Dr. Armando Lee, Bamm Gabriana, and Rochelle Derilo to observe the rare Mercury transit. Gubat was the best town in Luzon to observe the event.\n\nAlthough, the dominant religion is Roman Catholicism, there are Gubatnons devoted to:\n\nThe main livelihoods of the people, then and now, are agriculture and fishing. Harvest times for rice crops are from April to May, and December. Fishing is year-round. Forestry products are also source of income here.\n\nGubat can be reached mostly through land transport from Manila by bus, taking about 12 hours.

The sand bottom beach breaks of Barangays Ariman and Buenavista (Dangkalan and Rizal Beach) produce 2 to 5 feet waves from September to May. With the formation of Gubat Bay Surfers by Bidge Villarroya and surfboards donated by the Local Government Unit under Mayor Ding Ramos, surfing is more accessible to the local population and tourists alike. The new group of Gubat Sorsogon Surfer's Association, still under Bidge Villarroya is now performing well in the National Surf Competition Scene, winning 5 national surf championships and numerous finalist positions. Gubat is the Top 1 in Ngo Sport Airsoft Society by the NGO Bicol Sorsogon Chapter.\n\nThe town celebrates its Ginubat Festival annually every June 1-13 in honor of its patron, St. Anthony of Padua.

{"id": "2098760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098760", "title": "Irosin, Sorsogon", "text": "Irosin, Sorsogon\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIts local tourism is considered to have a great potential, as ecological tourism is becoming popular worldwide.\n\nIrosin is the only land-locked municipality in the province.\n\nIrosin is politically subdivided into 28 barangays.\n\nEarlier than 1847, Irosin was a far inland valley unspoiled by human settlers and covered by vast forest expanse teeming with wild animals. Irosin was among the last places in the Philippines to be populated. Most of the natives during the early 1800s lived along the coastal areas where it was more accessible to commercial, travel and communication activities at the time.\n\nThe place had been an undisturbed sanctuary for wildlife until settlers from Bulusan came in search of wild quarry and rattan. These pioneers, using the slash-and-burn method, cleared a settlement beside a river which gave birth to a clearing called Hin-ay, an Albayanon word which denotes the arrangement of the abaca yarn or tupos into a zigzagging pattern ( hinan-ay ) in preparation for its actual weaving. Accordingly, the hin-ay or the pattern was the image drawn to connote the waving rivers crisscrossing from the mountains down the valley. In yet another account, the word hin-ay was purported to have been derived from the term an-hay which means gradually ascending. The original settlement which is now called San Agustin is located east of the town proper at a higher elevation, thus the gradual ascent from the lower villages to the then barrio center of San Agustin.\n\nIt was in 1847 when Hin-ay was declared a barrio of Bulusan. The Gobernadorcillo of Bulusan visited Hin-ay and appointed Apolonio Capido as the first barrio lieutenant. Deeply influenced by Catholicism brought by the Spanish friars, the natives of Hin-ay constructed a makeshift chapel and dedicated it to their patron Saint Michael Archangel. As years passed, the original clearing had grown into a bustling community and eventually, the settlers requested the church authorities to bestow upon San Miguel a status independent and separate from that of Bulusan. The petition was granted and Holy Masses on Sundays and holidays of obligation were held regularly. In 1876, the Parish of San Miguel was officially recognized with Father Mariano Miranda as its parish priest and consequently, Hin-ay became known as San Miguel. On December 12, 1879, through a Royal Decree executed by the Governor General Domingo Moriones y Murillo, San Miguel was made a duly constituted pueblo or town.\n\nDuring those years Pedro Fruto (1881-1882), Domingo Gamba (1883-1884) and Juan Gallarda (1885-1886) were the public officials who were addressed as Capitanes del Pueblo. From the year 1880, the town of San Miguel flourished as an independent political unit under the Province of Albay when Sorsogon, until October 10, 1894, was not yet separated from its mother province. The first Guardia Civil came to Irosin in 1883. Its members were Filipinos headed by a Spanish Captain. With the spread of the underground movement called by the Spaniards hombres rebeldes in 1894, more Spanish forces called casadores were dispatched to Irosin. They imposed curfew hours in a bid to curtail the local uprisings.\n\nIt was during the incumbency of Father Esteban Rivera in 1887 when the name San Miguel was again changed to Irosin. The word was derived from the local term iros which means to cut-off a part. The word was traced to have come from an old tailor’s term synonymous with tabas as in ”irosi an hiniro” or cut a part of the cloth. Iros was the image most probably drawn to connote the gush or flow of floodwaters eroding riverbanks and cutting through lands to eventually form another river or river route.\n\nThe old historical tale of Elias Cuadro and Sabiniano Gacias (1937) runs thus:\n\nGiving credence to the above account, Irosin was indeed frequently eroded due to inundations of the rivers. On the 24th of December 1933, massive flooding occurred sending many inhabitants to death. A concrete river control dike in 1937 under Mayor Felipe Santiago and Congressman Norberto Roque was constructed to keep the violent surge of the river from eroding the town’s mainland..\n\nIrosin has many potential tourist spots varying from natural parks, hot and cold springs, viewing areas and historical landmark. The famous tourism attractions in the municipality are the Mateo Hot and Cold Spring Resort, St. Michael Archangel Roman Catholic Hilltop Church and protected areas. The Bolos Crystal Spring and the Valley View Park where eateries, kiosks and parking spaces were set up had become a rest area for truckers and travelers plying the Maharlika Highway. Another potential tourist attraction is the Mapaso mineral hot spring famous for its purported healing qualities. Irosin is an ideal jump-off site for mountaineering and ecological trek that is becoming popular among tourists both foreign and local. The municipality is an entry and exit area to BVNP one of the remaining tropical forests and is a protected area in the Bicol Region. Mount Jormajam and Mount Mara-ot Banwa are the other alternative places for mountaineering and ecological trekking.\n\nThere are also a number of tourist accommodations and facilities in Irosin. The Mateo Hot and Cold Springs Resort have conference halls, dormitories, cottages, eatery and swimming pools ideal for rest and recreation, conference and seminars. There is also the Guest World Resort and Nature Spring Resort with pools and accommodations. There are other lodging houses such as Villa Lim Condominium and Saint Michael Lodging House. Restaurants, snack bars and eateries are found along the CBD and inside the Irosin Public Market.\n\nThe most common cultural activities in the municipality are the annual santacruzan, barangay fiestas and town fiesta where Paray Festival is showcased. The Paray Festival in September culminates with the street play Viva San Miguel, celebrated in honor of Saint Michael Archangel, the patron saint of Irosin.\n\nThe local tourism industry has a great potential since ecological tourism is the trend worldwide and the national government intends to develop Bicol as a major hub for tourists. Given the variety of natural tourist spots in the municipality and its strategic location, Irosin can be a convergence area of foreign and domestic tourists and visitors.\n\nThere are two kinds of Primary Education in Irosin. The public schools, particularly Irosin Central School and one private school the Holy Spirit Academy of Irosin\n\nIrosin has many secondary educational institutions. The largest public high school is Gallanosa National High School. There is also a Secondary School in some bigger barangays of Irosin: Gabao National High School and the Irosin North National High School\n\nThe Holy Spirit Academy of Irosin is also the only private secondary school.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAccording to renowned historians and anthropologists such as Domingo Abella, Luis Camara Dery, Merito Espinas, F. Mallari, Norman Owen, Mariano Goyena del Prado, et al., Magallanes is also the present location of the ancient settlement of Ibalong.\n\nIn 1569, the Jimenez-Orta expedition landed at Barangay Ginangra near the village of Gibal-ong, the site where the first mass in the island of Luzon was said, the site of the first Christian settlement. Magallanes started as settlement called Parina, a name derived from the hardwood tree reputed to be so durable as to last for centuries that was known to abound in the place long before it became a barrio of Pueblo de Casiguran under the old province of Albay.\n\nThis settlement was not spared from sporadic sorties launched by punitive bands from the south, that in 1854 one group of that band ravage Ginangra and took as hostage one family from the village. As a counter-measure, the Spanish Comandancia of Parina constructed a watchtowers in such strategic places as Telegrapo and Bagatao which were equipped with cannons and manned around the clock. Cannon also were mounted in Cañonera the present site of Binisitahan del Norte at the mouth of Incarizan River.\n\nOn July 16, 1860 the name Parina was changed to Magallanes in honor of the Portuguese who discovered the Philippines island in 1521 Ferdinand Magellan. Magallanes was officially declared a pueblo with Don Manuel de Castro as its first appointed governadorcillo. In 1864 the Parish of our Lady of Mt. Carmel was canonically established with Rev. Fr. Higino de Castro as its first pastor. It was during this year that the first census was conducted resulting to a total count of 1400 inhabitants. Moreover, the town was split into six cabeseras each of which was entrusted to the administrative supervision of a cebeja de barangay.\n\nPursuant to the decree of the Spanish Crown, new official with new corresponding titles were elected. Don Juan de Castro was chosen as the first Capitan Municipal in 1894. In 1901 the municipality elected its first set of official under the American. Don Inocencio M. Mella was elected Presidente Municipal under the Malolos Constitution.\n\nMagallanes is politically subdivided into 34 barangays.\n\nMagallanes is primary considered a coastal town as 24 of its 34 barangays are situated along the seashore and with the abundant marine resource, the natives take to the sea daily for their food and livelihood.\n\nMarine and fishpond fishing are the town's prime industry despite large agricultural lands being engaged as well in crop and livestock production. Fish drying is a common practice among the locals after which the produce is sold to neighboring towns. For the fishpond culture, they are able to produce milkfish, tilapia, prawns and mud crab. The variety of ways the marine and inland fishing produce are processed include sardine in oil, bangus in oil, dried posit, dilis tuyo, daing and tinapa.\n\nSardine and Bangus in Oil are OTOP products processed by the Magallanes Food Products while the dried and smoke fish are processed by the Bacolod Women's Cooperative and by the fish folks themselves.\n\nCrops production of rice, corn, coconut, fruit trees, vegetables and root cops make an abundant produce for the town. Of these crops, coconut accounts about 96.15% making it the dominant major product.\n\n"}

In 1957 the sitios of Naspi and Calaguitan were separated from the barrio of Putiao and converted into the barrio of Naspi.\n\nThough whale sharks are more associated with the town of Donsol, whale sharks can also be seen in Pilar Bay near San Antonio. Interaction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local department office. With the help of WWF, strict guidelines were developed to protect the sharks. These include limiting the number of swimmers per boat, no scuba divers and staying further than three meters away from the sharks. In practice, this rule is almost never applied. As many as 14 boats at a time may 'mob' a shark, with up to 30 or 40 swimmers following the shark on the surface. In recent years the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. The females that are seen are generally large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propellor marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats in the main January–May tourist season.\n\n"}

The town was given its present name from the surnames of the two Bicolano martyrs, Father Gabriel Prieto (1853–1897) and Father Severino Diaz (1862–1897) when it became independent from the Municipality of Bacon on October 12, 1903 by virtue of Act 940 of the Philippine Commission. Prieto-Diaz was the only town organized after Sorsogon became a Province on October 17, 1894.\n\nPrieto-Diaz is 387 km (241 mi) southeast of Manila, 150 km(31m) east-southeast of Legazpi City, the regional center and 20 km (12.4 mi) north-north-east of Sorsogon City, the provincial capital.

One of these languages in the \"Southern Ayta (Sorsogon Ayta)\" language which has an estimated speaker of 150 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Sorsogon Ayta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Sorsogon Ayta people live only on the municipality of Prieto-Diaz, Sorsogon.

{"id": "2098781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098781", "title": "Philip S. Foner", "text": "Philip S. Foner\n\nPhilip Sheldon Foner (December 14, 1910 – December 13, 1994) was an American labor historian and teacher. Foner was a prolific author and editor of more than 100 books. He is considered a pioneer in his extensive works on the role of radicals, blacks, and women in American labor and political history, which were generally neglected in mainstream academia at the time. A Marxist thinker, he influenced more than a generation of scholars, inspiring some of the work published by younger academics from the 1970s on. In 1941, Foner became a public figure as one among 26 persons fired from teaching and staff positions at City College of New York for political views, following an investigation of communist influence in education by a state legislative committee, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee.\n\nFoner is best remembered for his 10-volume \"History of the Labor Movement in the United States,\" published between 1947 and 1994. He also edited the 5-volume collection \"The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass,\" and wrote a biography of the abolitionist leader. His works \"Organized Labor and the Black Worker,\" (1974 and 1982 editions) and the two-volume \"Women in the American Labor Movement\" (1979 and 1980) also broke new ground in history. For his \"American Labor Songs of the Nineteenth Century\" (1975), Foner received the Deems Taylor Award, presented by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).\n\nHis scholarship, publications and political affiliations were considered to be on the far left. In 1979, the New York State Board of Higher Education formally apologized to Foner and other persons who lost their jobs as a result of the Rapp-Coudert Committee, saying it had seriously violated academic freedom. A controversy over Foner's work and scholarship practices arose in academic circles in 2003, with a discussion of plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. The New York Labor History Association had awarded Foner a lifetime achievement award in 1994. It reiterated its support in 2003 that the value of his work exceeded his shortcomings.\n\nFoner was born in 1910 into an Eastern European immigrant family on the Lower East Side of New York City. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian empire. Foner grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and graduated from Eastern District High School.\n\nPhilip Foner had three brothers, who also became important figures in the American Left, coming to adulthood during the Great Depression. His twin brother Jack D. Foner (1910–1999) became a professional historian, and was the father of historian Eric Foner. Two other brothers were leading unionists: Moe Foner was active in 1199 of the United Healthcare Workers and was particularly notable for running the union's cultural programs. Henry Foner led the Furriers' Union.\n\nFoner obtained his Bachelor's degree from the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1932, where he and his brother Jack were both students of historian Allan Nevins. He earned his Master's degree from Columbia University in 1933. In 1941 he received his Ph.D. from Columbia.\n\nFoner became an instructor of history at City College of New York in 1933, the same year in which he obtained his master's degree. He taught there through 1941, when his first book was published, \"Business and Slavery: The New York Merchants and the Irrepressible Conflict.\"\n\nFoner was one of 26 faculty and staff members of City College who were fired from their jobs by the end of 1942 as a result of an investigation of communist influences in higher education by the New York State Legislature's Rapp-Coudert Committee. Established in spring 1940, it was officially known as the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational System of the State of New York. Foner testified at the investigative hearings in April 1941, during which he denied being a member of the Communist Party.\n\nThe next month he was brought up on charges by the Board of Higher Education's Conduct Committee. In August the Board held a trial in his case on charges that he belonged to the Communist Party, had participated in such related activities as the publication of \"The Teacher-Worker\", a newsletter of a Communist Party unit active at City College; and had given false testimony at his hearing. The trial committee made a report recommending his dismissal in November 1941.\n\nFoner's three brothers: his twin Jack, a professor of history at CCNY; Moe, a worker in the CCNY registrar's office; and Henry, a substitute teacher in the New York City public schools, were also caught up in the investigation. They were fired from their jobs as well.\n\nAfter his dismissal from City College, Foner became a principal and chief editor for Citadel Press, based in New York City. This was his primary means of survival during the years of being blacklisted.\n\nIn 1947, the first volume of what would become Foner's magnum opus, \"A History of the Labor Movement of the United States,\" was released by International Publishers, a publisher considered close to the Communist Party USA. Writing as a Marxist, Foner emphasized the role of the working class and their allies in a class struggle dating to the earliest days of the American republic.\n\nOne historian described his work as presenting \"a formidable challenge to the orthodox John R. Commons interpretation of labor history.\" This school of thought at the University of Wisconsin considered unionized workers to be improving their position in American capitalism. By contrast, according to historian Nelson Lichtenstein, Foner believed that \"unions were part of a broader movement for democratization -- a means of struggling for political and social goals such as equality and power, as well as better wages, hours, and working conditions.\" He published nine more volumes in this history during his life, with the last, ending at the eve of the Great Depression, published shortly before his death.\n\nIn 1949, Foner published the first volume of his multi-volume work, \"The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass,\" also produced by International Publishers in New York City. The work totaled five volumes, being published between 1949 and 1952. His nephew Eric Foner, known for his own work on the Reconstruction era, said that Douglass had been largely forgotten as an important abolitionist and African-American leader when his uncle started publishing his writings.\n\nIn 1967, the power of the blacklist finally waned. Philip Foner was hired as a history professor at Lincoln University, a historically black university located near Oxford, Pennsylvania. Foner served here until his retirement in 1979.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Foner continued to publish books. He usually worked as a co-author and editor of document collections in association with a younger scholar. An historian of a later generation described his style as amassing primary documents, in the manner of some 19th-century historians.\n\nIn 1979, nearly three decades after the mass firings at City College, the New York State Board of Higher Education formally apologized to Foner and persons attacked by the Rapp-Coudert Committee, whose lives had been disrupted by firings, political fears and rumors. The Board described the conduct of the Rapp-Coudert Committee as \"an egregious violation of academic freedom.\"\n\nFoner became a professor of history at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey in 1981.\n\nFollowing his wife Roslyn's death, Foner married again in 1988. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1991.\n\nFoner's work was politically controversial in a period of American fears about immigrant anarchists, labor unrest, and the power of the Soviet Union and Communist Party. Some historians have also criticized his work on scholarly grounds. In 1971, writing in \"Labor History\" journal, historian James O. Morris documented that Foner had plagiarized material from Morris' 1950s unpublished master's thesis in his 1965 book, \"The Case of Joe Hill.\" Morris wrote that \"About one quarter of the Foner text is a verbatim or nearly verbatim reproduction\" of his manuscript, and had other complaints.\n\nScholars such as labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein acknowledge that Foner's shortcomings were recognized in the 1970s and 1980s, but supporters believe that he still made substantial contributions to the field.\n\nIn May 2003, complaints about Foner were discussed among labor historians on H-Labor and in postings at the \"History News Network,\" with accusations of plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. Scott McLemee reviewed the controversy in an article in \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" and noted that old political debates were being re-opened. Many academics, intellectuals and artists had suffered suppression during the McCarthy era.\n\nFoner's nephew Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University said that \"his uncle's radical politics are the crux of the recent debate. 'Obviously, any charge of plagiarism needs to be taken seriously,' he says. 'But I think that this controversy is being muddied up with powerful ideological issues that ought to be kept quite separate'.\"\n\nIn May 2003, labor historian Mel Dubofsky accused Philip Foner of having \"borrowed wholesale from my then unpublished dissertation\" on the Industrial Workers of the World for use in Volume 4 of his \"History of the Labor Movement in the United States.\" Dubofsky said that Foner extracted large chunks of this dissertation \"without attribution or inverted commas.\" Dubofsky alleged that Foner had similarly used unpublished work of other young scholars \"too numerous to mention.\" But Dubofsky also noted that many young labor historians in the 1970s felt that Foner had suffered enough in being blacklisted and were reluctant to take any official action against him. He said, \"So even the people whose work he had borrowed from freely did not want to say anything.\"\n\nHistorian John Earl Haynes, who has used Soviet archives for his multi-volume work on the American Communist Party, said there had long been criticisms of Foner for plagiarism, but said he was a \"hero to radical historians.\" In a posting on the \"History News Network,\" Haynes said that Foner had inaccurately footnoted references to some of Haynes' work.\n\nEric Foner added another perspective to his uncle's work: \nHe edited the writings of Frederick Douglass at a time when, believe it or not, nobody remembered him. He edited seven volumes of documents on the history of black labor in the United States, and collections of material from black political conventions in the 19th century. And he did all of it without research assistants or grants. This debate is not doing justice to his contributions to scholarship. \n\nIn recognition of the value of the historian's body of work, the president of the New York Labor History Association said it had no plans to revoke the lifetime-achievement award it gave to Foner in 1994.\n\nFoner married Roslyn Held in 1939. The pair had two daughters, Elizabeth and Laura.\n\nPhilip S. Foner died age 83 on December 13, 1994, the day before his 84th birthday.\n\nFor his \"American Labor Songs of the Nineteenth Century\" (1975), Foner received the Deems Taylor Award, presented by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). \n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries from 1982 to 1987. He was best known by the public for his BBC television show, \"Troubleshooter\", in which he advised struggling businesses.\n\nJohn Henry Harvey-Jones was born in Hackney, London, but spent most of his early childhood in Dhar, India, where his father, Mervyn Stockton Harvey-Jones (né Harvey), a former Captain in the Indian Army and bank employee, was guardian and tutor to a teenage maharajah. He was shipped back to Britain at age six to attend a prep school at Deal, Kent. He entered Dartmouth Royal Naval College at age 13.\nHarvey-Jones joined Dartmouth Royal Naval College as a cadet in 1937, and in 1940, at the age of 16, he joined HMS \"Diomede\" as a midshipman. The next two ships that he served with, HMS \"Ithuriel\" and HMS \"Quentin\", were sunk by enemy action. Harvey-Jones went on to join the submarine service in 1942, and received his first command at age 24.\n\nWith the end of World War II, Harvey-Jones went to the University of Cambridge to learn Russian in six months and joined Naval Intelligence as an interpreter. He married Mary Bignell in 1947, and he commanded the Russian intelligence section under the guise of the \"British Baltic Fishery Protection Service\", which used two ex-German E-boats for gathering clandestine intelligence on the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Rising to the rank of lieutenant-commander, Harvey-Jones was awarded a military MBE in 1952 for his work in Naval Intelligence, although his citation stated that the award was for \"fishery protection duties in the Baltic\".\n\nRefused permission by the Royal Navy to spend more time with his wife and daughter Gaby, who had contracted polio, he resigned his commission in 1956 and joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) on Teesside as a junior training manager. In 1973, at age 49, he was promoted to sit on the main board of directors. In April 1982, he became chairman of ICI, only the second split-career man and non-chemist to reach the top.\n\nMentored in part by John Adair, Harvey-Jones saw his responsibilities to both stockholders and employees as \"making a profit out of the markets where the market is\". He maintained a firm belief in \"speed rather than direction\", on the assumption that \"once travelling a company can veer and tack towards the ultimate objective.\" Thus, at the business level he cut non-profit making and what he saw as non-core businesses, so that at board level he could concentrate on putting more power in fewer hands \"to reduce the number of those who can say 'no' and increase the motivation of those who can say 'yes'\", maintaining that \"there are no bad troops, only bad leaders\". After only 30 months in the job, having cut the UK workforce by one third, he had doubled the price of ICI shares and turned a loss into a one-billion-pound profit.\n\nAccording to one newspaper, it was the BBC's \"Troubleshooter\" series, first broadcast in 1990, that made Harvey-Jones the most famous industrialist since Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It ran to five series and several specials in the 1990s and also won him a BAFTA award. His advice was at times controversial—in particular he was critical of the Morgan Motor Company, which some argue was vindicated, as it is still trading successfully today.\nIn 1989, he became chairman of \"The Economist\", was a non-executive director of Grand Metropolitan plc (now part of Diageo), and honorary vice-president of the Institute of Marketing.\n\nHarvey-Jones was also chairman of the Burns-Anderson Group plc, a conglomerate spanning merchant banking, financial services, recruitment, marketing and business services, and stockbroking.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1991, Harvey-Jones served as the second Chancellor of the University of Bradford. A commemorative painting exists in the University of Bradford collection, and Harvey-Jones also agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar for a terracotta portrait at Clyro in July 2004.\n\nHe was chairman of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and member of the Advisory Council of the Prince's Trust. In 2001, he became the president of the MS Trust.\n\nDescribed by \"The Guardian\" as one of the best-known British advocates of Transcendental Meditation, Harvey-Jones said, \"I don't make a drama out of a crisis. If I gave it up now, my wife would leave me.\" Having lived most of his post-retirement period in Ross-on-Wye, he died in his sleep after a long illness, aged 83, at the Hereford County Hospital.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2098803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098803", "title": "Songcatcher", "text": "Songcatcher\n\nSongcatcher is a 2000 drama film directed by Maggie Greenwald. It is about a musicologist researching and collecting Appalachian folk music in the mountains of western North Carolina. Although \"Songcatcher\" is a fictional film, it is loosely based on the work of Olive Dame Campbell, founder of the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina, and that of the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp, portrayed at the end of the film as professor Cyrus Whittle.\n\nIn 1907, Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), a professor of musicology, is denied a promotion at the university where she teaches. She impulsively visits her sister Eleanor (Jane Adams), who runs a struggling rural school in Appalachia. There, she discovers a treasure trove of traditional English and Scots-Irish ballads, which have been preserved by the secluded mountain people since the colonial period of the 1600s and 1700s. Lily decides to record and transcribe the songs and share them with the outside world.\n\nWith the help of a musically talented orphan named Deladis Slocumb (Emmy Rossum), Lily ventures into isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs. She finds herself increasingly enchanted, not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harsh conditions. She becomes privy to their struggles to save their land from Earl Giddens (David Patrick Kelly), representative of a coal mining company. At the same time, Lily is troubled when she finds that Eleanor is engaged in a lesbian love affair with her co-teacher at the school.\n\nLily meets Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician. Despite some initial resentment, she soon begins a love affair with him. She experiences a slow change in both her perception of the mountain people as savage and uncouth, and of her sister's sexuality as immoral. Hoping to help share the culture of the mountain people with the wider world, Lily convinces Clementine McFarland (Rhoda Griffis), an art collector, to purchase a painting done by a local woman.\n\nEvents come to a crisis when a young man discovers Eleanor and her lover, Harriet, kissing in the woods. That night, two men set fire to the school building, burning Eleanor, Harriet, and Deladis out of their home and destroying Lily's transcriptions of the ballads and her phonograph recordings. Rather than starting over again, Lily decides to leave, but she convinces Tom and Deladis to \"go down the mountain\" with her to make and sell phonograph recordings of mountain music. As they depart, Cyrus Whittle, a renowned professor from England, arrives on a collection foray of his own, ensuring that the ballads will be preserved in the manner that Lily had originally intended.\n\nThe character of Viney Butler was based on Mary Jane Queen, whom Greenwald consulted when researching the film.\n\nProducer Ellen Rigas invested $3 million in \"Songcatcher\" which her family borrowed as part of the Adelphia Communications fraud.\n\nThe film's score was written by David Mansfield, who also assembled a roster of female country music artists to perform mostly traditional mountain ballads. Some of the songs are contemporary arrangements, and some are played in the traditional Appalachian music style. The artists include Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Maria McKee, Dolly Parton, Gillian Welch and Patty Loveless. Singers Emmy Rossum, Iris DeMent, and Hazel Dickens, who appeared in the film, are also featured on the soundtrack.\n\nThe soundtrack album inspired the 2002 follow-up album by Vanguard Records, \"Songcatcher II: The Tradition That Inspired the Movie\", that compiled recordings of some of the songs selected for the film as performed by authentic Appalachian artists. The recordings are mostly from the 1960s, out of the Vanguard vaults.\n\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.34/10 based on 88 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The story may be a bit too melodramatic, but great performances abound in Songcatcher. The real reason to see the movie, however, is the hypnotic music.\" Metacritic assigned a score of 63 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\n\n"}

His ancestors, the Ó Céirín (later anglicised as \"Kerins\"), were anciently Gaelic lords of Ciarraige Locha na nÁirne, with a long history in Mayo.\n\nHe studied teaching and in 1864 joined The Marist Brothers Teaching Order. He moved to Scotland in the 1870s and taught at St. Marys School and the Sacred Heart School where he was appointed headmaster in 1874. He also helped found St. Joseph's College, Dumfries.\n\nIn 1888, he founded The Celtic Football Club as a means of raising funds for the catholic poor and deprived in the east end of Glasgow. In 1893 Walfrid was sent by his religious order to London's East End. Here he continued his work, organizing football matches for and showing great kindness to the barefoot catholic children in the districts of Bethnal Green and Bow. The charity established by Walfrid was named \"The Poor Children's Dinner Table\".\n\nHe died on 17 April 1915, leaving a surviving brother, Bernard, in Cloghboley, County Sligo. Walfrid is buried in the Mount St. Michael Cemetery in Dumfries.\n\nA commemorative sculpture of Walfrid was erected outside Celtic Park on 5 November 2005. \n\nThe sculpture by Kate Robinson was cast in bronze and its pedestal carved from granite. The statue cost ₤30,000 which was funded entirely by donations organised by the Brother Walfrid Committee, including ₤5,000 from then chairman of the club, Brian Quinn. The veil for the unveiling ceremony was made by workshops in fourteen schools and community centres throughout Glasgow. Funded by Sense Over Sectarianism, artists worked with young people to create images of footballers and football strips which were digitally printed onto the veil itself. The unveiling was performed by former assistant manager and player Sean Fallon, himself a native of Sligo. The ceremony was attended by the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Mario Conti who blessed the statue, several thousand fans and former Celtic and Rangers captains and managers Billy McNeil and John Greig.\n\nNew music for the ceremony called \"Walfrid at the Gates of Paradise\" was composed by relative James MacMillan. Archbishop Conti presented club officials with a Celtic cross from the church where Celtic were established, Saint Mary's, Calton the second oldest church in the Archdiocese of Glasgow. After the ceremony, the Celtic Charity Fund presented a cheque of ₤5,000 for St Mary's, to help the restoration fund for the church and to recognise the important link between club and community.\n\nA further sculpture, a bust of Brother Walfrid, commemorating his links with his home town of Ballymote, was unveiled in the public park there in 2005.\n\n\n"}

He established David Chipperfield Architects in 1985.\n\nHis major works include the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (1989–1998); the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany; the Des Moines Public Library, Iowa (2002–2006); the Neues Museum, Berlin (1997–2009); The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Wakefield, UK (2003–2011), the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri (2005–2013); and the Museo Jumex in Mexico City (2009–2013).\n\nRowan Moore, the architecture critic of the \"Guardian\" of London, described his work as serious, solid, not flamboyant or radical, but comfortable with the history and culture of its setting. \"He deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and in art.\" \n\nDavid Chipperfield Architects is a global architectural practice with offices in London, Berlin, Milan, and Shanghai.\n\nChipperfield was born in London in 1953, and graduated in 1976 from Kingston School of Art in London. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his own firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985. As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically-attuned, place-specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.\n\nHe first established his reputation designing store interiors in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Among Chipperfield's early projects in England was a shop for Issey Miyake on London's Sloane Street. His shops in Japan led to commissions to design for a private museum in the Chiba prefecture (1987), design for a store for the automobile company Toyota in Kyoto (1989), and the headquarters of the Matsumoto Company in Okayama (1990). His firm opened an office in Tokyo in 1989. He first commission to design an actual building was for a house for the fashion photographer Nick Knight in London in 1990.\n\nHis first completed projects in London were the gallery of botany and the entrance hall for the Museum of Natural History (1993), and restaurant Wagamama, both in London. His first major project in Britain was the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames (1989) (see below). He also began to build in Germany, designing an office building in Düsseldorf (1994–1997). Other projects in the 1990s included the Circus Restaurant in London (1997) and the Joseph Menswear Shop (1997). The latter shop featured a curtain of glass six meters high around the two lower floors, and an austere modernist interior with dark gray sandstone floors and white walls.\n\nIn 1997 he began one of his most important projects, the reconstruction and restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been largely destroyed during World War II. After 2000, he won commissions for several other major museum projects in Germany, designed several major museum projects in Germany, including the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach (2002–2006), and the Galerie Am Kupfergraben 10 in Berlin (2003–2007). In the same period he designed and built, at rapid speed, a new headquarters for the America's Cup in Valencia, Spain (2005–2006), and an enormous judicial complex in Barcelona, Spain, which consolidated the offices previously contained in seventeen different buildings into nine new immense concrete blocks. He also constructed his first project in the United States, an extension of the Museum of ethnology and natural history in Anchorage, Alaska (2003–2009).\n\nUntil 2011 most of his major projects were on the continent of Europe, but lin 2011 he opened two notable museum projects in Britain, the Turner Contemporary (2006–11) in Margate, and The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield. In 2013 he opened the Jumex Museum in Mexico City, and the extension of the Saint Louis Art Museum in the United States. His most remote project was the Museum of Naga, on a site in the desert 170 kilometers northeast of Khartoum in Sudan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He designed a structure to preserve the remains of two ancient temples and an artesian well, dating to 300 B.C.-300 A.D. The building, built of the local stone, blends into reddish mountains around it.\n\nIn 2015, Chipperfield won a competition to redesign the modern and contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. He also began his first ground-up building in New York City, the Bryant, a thirty-three story hotel and condominium project next to Bryant Park in Manhattan. In 2017 he and his associates were engaged in a multitude of major projects around the world; including new flagship stores for Bally and Valentino, the reconstruction of the U.S, Embassy in London; One Pancras Square, an office and commercial complex behind King's Cross Station in London.a project for the Shanghai Expo tower in China, the new Nobel Center headquarters for the Nobel Prize in Stockholm, a headquarters store for the online firm SSENSE in Montreal, the Kuntshaus cultural center in Zurich, the Haus der Kunst cultural center in Munich, the completion of the headquarters of Amorepacific in Seoul, Korea, and the Inagara Reien Project, a temple complex in Japan\n\nThe River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames is devoted particularly to the sports of rowing; the town hosted is home to the Annual Royal Regatta Olympic boating events in 1908 and 1948. The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2300 square meters, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of non-treated oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel,The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through roof.\n\nThe Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct. The two-story building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. a glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library. Its most distinct feature is an exterior of glass panels with cooper mesh sandwiched between them; the mesh blocks eighty percent of the sunlight, while allowing library patrons to gaze out at the park around the library. Chipperfield told Christopher Hall of the \"New York Times\": \"The architecture is neutral and amorphous; almost no architecture at all, and the copper mesh is an attempt to veil the building as much as possible while allowing the outside in.\"\n\nThe Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach, Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. and benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s. Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below. While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside. The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity. The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007.\n\nChipperfield won a 2005 competition and construct a new headquarters for the America's Cup on the coast in Valencia, Spain. It was completed in just eleven months. The distinctive features of the 10,000 square meter building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen meters, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea. The predominant color inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white-painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood.\n\nIn 1997 Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged during World War II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the buildings walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history. As Chipperfield explained, the architects used these materials so that \"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\" The building received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2011. In 2007 Chipperfield began a new project with the museum, to construct a new gallery, the James Simon Gallery, inspired on the colonnade of the old museum. The new section will house more than ten thousand objects from the archeological collections, including the famed bust of Queen Nefertiti. Scheduled for completion in 2017, it was handed over to the museum in December 2018 with opening to the public scheduled for 2019.\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield is a gallery devoted to the work of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. It is composed of ten trapezoidal blocks; its upper-level galleries are lit by natural light from large windows in the pitched roofs. Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline. The building's façade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance.\n\nThe City of Justice is a group of nine buildings with 241,500 meters of space, which consolidate courtrooms and offices which previously were scattered among seventeen different buildings. The courtrooms are on the ground floor, with offices above. Four of the buildings are connected together by a four-story hallway. in addition to the judicial buildings, the complex, on the outskirts of Barcelona, includes a commercial center and retail stores, and a block of low income residential housing. The facades of the buildings are all the same, made of concrete poured in place and lightly tinted in different shades. Chipperfield wrote that the purpose of the building was to \"break the image of justice as rigid and monolithic\", but architectural critic Rowan Moore of the \"Guardian\" said it appeared \"uncomfortably prison-like.\"\n\nThe Saint Louis Art Museum project in Saint Louis, Missouri (2005–2013) involved building a major new wing attached to a landmark of American architecture, the gallery built by beaux-arts architect Cass Gilbert in 1904. The new building by Chipperfield, with 9000 square meters of space, harmonizes smoothly with the classic building; its ground level is the same as that of the main floor of the Gilbert Building. The walls are dark concrete were poured and polished in place, and the roof of concrete \"caissons\" is designed to modify the light entering the galleries. To give the facade a distinctive look which also blended with the Gilbert building, Chipperfield speckled the dark gray polished concrete walls with fragments of the same kind of sandstone used in the Gilbert building. Edwin Heathcote of the \"Financial Times\" called it \"a gem of clarity and deceptive simplicity...It is a building designed to glow, inside and out, one that is more about the intangibility of light than about mass reinforced by shadow.\"\n\nThe Turner Contemporary gallery is located beside a beach in Margate, to the north of Kent in the south of England. It is devoted to the works of J.M.W. Turner and his contemporaries, and those he influenced, and is close to the historic rooming house where the artist stayed. The museum is composed of six identical glass galleries, called \"Cristalins\", which are interconnected. The sunlight from the south is softened by a system of shutters over the ceiling, and the buildings are raised on pylons to avoid flooding from the neighboring sea. The fritted facades are designed to resist the dampness, corrosion and winds coming from the sea.\n\nThe Colección Jumex in Mexico City displays one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in Mexico, neighboring a theater and another museum in a modern neighborhood of the city. Zoning restrictions limited the space available, so Chipperfield put the museum administration, shop, and library in existing adjoining buildings, and devoted the Museum almost entirely to exhibit space. The galleries on the upper levels receive natural light from the skylights on the roof facing toward the west. The buiidling is supported on fourteen columns, and is built of concrete covered with plaques of travertine limestone from Xalapa, in Veracruz province. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the lower floors have frames of stainless steel.\n\nChipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of the \"New York Times\", \"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Andy Butler in \"Designboom\" , Chipperfield declared: \"The one thing you can't do in architecture, at least in my opinion, is to limit your way of thinking to a style, or a material, you have to be responsive to the circumstances of a project.\" He declared that \"architecture could not be globalized\", because it varied depending upon the culture of a city. \"However contemporary we feel that we are, we still want to find different characteristics in different places. When we are building in a city we have a responsibility in a way to join in and to understand why buildings are as they are in that city. I find it very weak for an architect to disregard the history and culture of a city and say \"I have an international style.\" There's absolutely no justification for that. It's the equivalent of having no variation in a cuisine, you may as well just place all the different types of food in a blender and consume it as a protein-rich shake.\"\n\nArchitecture critic Rowan Moore observed that \"Chipperfield stresses less glamorous questions, such as, \"how is a building going to look five or ten years later?\" He quotes Chipperfiield on his work on the Neues Museum, a project which lasted twelve years. \"How you do things is profoundly important. the quality of the Neues museum construction is extraordinary even by German standards, and people can smell the quality. The concept would not have been so convincing without it.\"\n\nChipperfield described the style of his recent The Bryant residential tower in New York City (2013–2018) as \"classical elegance in terms of its symmetries and simple grids and order.\" Describing the Bryant Park, Tim McKeough of the New York Times wrote \"In contrast with other big-name architects who wow with audacious forms and breathtaking structural feats, Mr. Chipperfield is best-known for buildings with a pared-down aesthetic purity.\" He noted that Chipperfield's signature on the building was the facade, composed of precast terrazzo panels with a mosaic of marble and sandstone chips, polished to a matte finish, to give the building a distinctive reflective color.\n\nRowan Moore of \"The Guardian\" reviewed the body of Chipperfield's work in a 2011 article. He was critical of some buildings, such as the Hepworth Gallery, which he suggested resembled \"a bunker\", and the law courts in Barcelona, which he said were \"uncomfortably prison-like, as if defendants were guilty until proven innocent,\" but he also found much to admire in Chipperfield's work: \"He is much sought after for projects that help define cities' modern view of themselves, often in relation to a rich or fraught history. He deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and art. He likes \"permanence\", \"substance\", and \"meaning\", and dislikes designs that are spectacular for the hell of it...His buildings have a strong presence, with right angles and straight lines prominent. He likes solid masonry and concrete, where you seed that stuff that is holding the building up, and sense its mass. He adheres, arguably too much, to the classical idea that architecture is about naked materials and structures seen in daylight. Mobility, surface, illusion, or the way artificial lighting forms cities at night, is less important to him...He likes the appearance and reality of permanence, and is skeptical about architect's common feeling that buildings can be as light and transient as airplanes or tents.\" He cites Chipperfield: \"'You always have to dig a hole in the ground and pour a lot of concrete into it.'\" Moore wrote: \"What all these projects have in common is the desire to bring out the best in the thing that Chipperfield finds in the brief or site – the ruins in Berlin, the light in Margate, the art in Wakefield.\"\n\nChipperfield has taught architecture in Europe and the United States, and has lectured extensively, including as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001. In addition Chipperfield held the Mies van der Rohe Chair at the Escola Técnica, in Barcelona, Spain, and the Norman R. Foster Professorship of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. He is a visiting professor at the University of the Arts London (formerly London Institute). He has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation and is currently a trustee of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London.\n\n\n\n\nThe practice's projects have received more than 100 architecture and design awards, including the 2007 RIBA Stirling Prize (for the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach), the 2011 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture (Mies van der Rohe Award), and the 2011 Deutscher Architekturpreis.\n\nChipperfield has been recognised for his work with honours and awards including membership of the Royal Academy of Arts, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, a knighthood for services to architecture, and the Praemium Imperiale from the Japan Art Association in 2013.\n\nIn 1999, Chipperfield was awarded the Tessenow Gold Medal, what was followed by a comprehensive exhibition of his work together with the work of the Tessenow Stipendiat and Spanish architect Andrés Jaque, held in the Hellerau Festspielhaus. In 2004 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to architecture, and was made Honorary Member of the Florence Accademia delle arti del Disegno in 2003. In 2009 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the highest tribute the Federal Republic of Germany can pay to individuals for services to the nation. In the New Year Honours 2010, Chipperfield was appointed as a Knight Bachelor for services to architecture in the UK and Germany. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2010 and the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2011.\n\n\"Form Matters,\" an exhibition looking back over Chipperfield's career, was mounted by London's Design Museum in 2009.

In medicine, it is usually defined as the recurrence of symptoms after a period of remission or quiescence, in which sense it can sometimes be synonymous with relapse. In a narrower sense it can also be such a recurrence with higher severity than before the remission.\n\nIn infectious diseases, recrudescence is the return of detectable symptoms in a patient whose blood stream infection has previously been at such a low level as not to be clinically demonstrable or cause symptoms. For example, the \"Plasmodium\" parasites, which are responsible for malaria, can persist in the blood without causing apparent symptoms for a few months, but recrudescence easily occurs, mainly due to challenges that tax the immune system. This is an example of where the term \"recrudescence\" is reserved for a separate meaning from \"relapse\", as relapse in this context occurs due to activation of hypnozoites in the liver.\n\nThe bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bovine virus diarrhea) is said to be recrudescent for some time after clinical signs have abated, because antibodies plateau c. weeks 10–12, and are not lifelong, auto infection may potentially occur in the acutely infected non-pregnant animal.\n\nOther diseases that may recur following a short or long period of quiescence include shingles (after chicken pox), oral herpes and genital herpes, and Brill–Zinsser disease (after epidemic typhus).\n"}

Moody fought racism and segregation from when she was a little girl in Centreville, Mississippi, and continued throughout her adult life around the American South.\n\nMoody, née Essie Mae Moody on September 15, 1940, was the oldest of eight children. After her parents split up when she was five or six years old, she grew up with her mother, Elmira aka Toosweet, in Centreville, Mississippi, while her father, Diddly, lived with his new wife, Emma, in nearby Woodville. At a young age Moody began working for white families in the area, cleaning their houses and helping their children with homework for only a few dollars a week, while earning perfect grades in school and helping at Mount Pleasant church. After graduating with honors from a segregated, all-black high school, she attended Natchez Junior College (also all black) in 1961 on a basketball scholarship.\n\nMoody then moved on to Tougaloo College on an academic scholarship, to earn a bachelor's degree. She became involved with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). After graduation, Moody became a full-time worker in the civil rights movement, participating in a variety of different protests such as marches and a sit-ins. Moody participated in a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Jackson, when a mob attacked her, fellow student Joan Trumpauer, and Tougaloo professor John Salter, Jr., joined her. The mob continuously poured flour, salt, sugar, and mustard on them, as depicted in a \"Jackson Daily News\" photograph. Two weeks after the sit-in, the Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated outside his family home in Jackson. She was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi for attempting to protest inside of a post office with 13 other protesters, including Joan Trumpauer, Doris Erskine, Jeanette King, and Lois Chaffee.\n\nIn the 1960s, Anne Moody went underground. In other words, she moved to New York and lived quietly for decades. She enforced that she would be a part of no interviews during this time. It was in New York, where Anne Moody wrote \"Coming of Age in Mississippi.\" During her quiet time she worked a number of non-writing jobs. Anne Moody wrote her second book, \"Mr. Death,\" in 1975. \"Mr. Death\" was filled with short stories aimed at younger people to teach them the theme of mortality.\n\nDuring Freedom Summer (1964), Moody worked for CORE in the town of Canton, Mississippi. In 1967, she married Austin Straus, a white man who was an NYU graduate student. In 1971, she gave birth to her son Sasha Strauss. In 1972, her family moved to Berlin after receiving a full-time scholarship, and they remained there until 1974 when they returned to America. Upon her return, she wrote a sequel to her autobiography, entitled \"Farewell to Too Sweet\", which covered her life from 1974 to 1984, and in a 1985 interview with Debra Spencer she spoke of writing other books of memoirs, all of which remain unpublished. Moody was also involved in the anti-nuclear movement. She resettled in Mississippi in the early 1990s, though never felt at ease there, according to her sister Adline Moody.\n\nOn February 5, 2015, Moody died at her home in Gloster, Mississippi at the age of 74, under the care of her younger sister Adline Moody, having suffered from dementia in recent years.\n\nMoody's autobiography, \"Coming of Age in Mississippi\" (1968), is acclaimed for its realistic portrayal of life for a young African American before and during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Her perspective of life in rural Mississippi is unique but not abnormal. Moody grew up in a household where her mother would suppress any idea of questioning the way things were or the concept of segregation. The book has been published in seven languages and sold around the world.\n\nMoody's autobiography opens onto her early life on a plantation with her mother, Toosweet, her father, Diddly, and her younger sister, Adline. At the time, she was called Essie Mae. Her uncle, George Lee, who was eight years old at the time, would watch over five-year-old Essie Mae and one-year-old Adline while their parents went to work. George Lee would neglect and abuse the girls. He was eventually dismissed from his babysitting duties after he started a fire in Essie Mae's family's two-bedroom shack. Essie's parents' relationship began to unravel after Diddly's friend, Bush, died and Diddly began seeing a lot more of Bush's wife, Florence. He began having an affair while Essie's mother was pregnant with their 3rd child, Junior. Toosweet eventually left Diddly, taking her children with her, and moved in with their Aunt Cindy. They stayed with her until Essie Mae's mother found a better job and moved them into a new home.\n\nLater on, Essie's mother had her fourth child, James, with a soldier named Raymond. The soldier and Miss Pearl, the soldier's mother, took the baby in because Toosweet was unable to afford to take care of four children at the time. Essie and her family continued to visit James while Raymond was in town, but they stopped visiting when he got called to service due to the cold treatment that Toosweet received from Miss Pearl.\n\nIn chapter three, Essie began to notice how all of the white people she encountered had nicer homes, better food, and more privileges in general than the average black person. Essie had received her first job working for an old white lady named Mrs. Carter. She swept her porch for 75 cents and some milk. Shortly after, Essie started working for Mrs. Claiborne who paid her three dollars a week. Essie enjoyed working for Mrs. Claiborne, because this woman taught her new things and allowed Essie to eat dinner with her family. Essie's mother later gets pregnant with her fifth baby, which is also her second child with Raymond. Due to this news Raymond begins building a house for Essie and her family. Essie, and her mother, began choosing furniture for their newly built house.\n\nEssie began playing for the basketball team at her school, she was the tallest on the team. So, consequently, the coach paid close attention to Essie. However, when the time came to play in her first basketball game, Essie froze, and her teammates laughed at her; she later quit. While living in her newly built house, built close to Miss Pearl's home, Essie noticed her mother had a difficult time being accepted into Raymond's family. Her Aunt Caroline later moved closer to the family, so her mother, Toosweet, would have someone to talk to. Essie's mother gave birth to her fifth child, they named her Virginia after Mrs. Johnson; however, she was called Jennie Ann.\n\nIn an attempt to be accepted into Raymond's family, Toosweet took herself and her children to Centreville Baptist Church, which was the church Raymond and his family went to. Toosweet went once, but stopped due to no progress in her relationship with Raymond's family, but Essie and her siblings kept going. Essie was later manipulated by her mother into going to their old church, Mount Pleasant. Essie was then baptized, even though she didn't want to be baptized at Mount Pleasant, due to her mother's manipulation. \n\nIn the 2nd winter Essie's family spent at their newly built home; Raymond decided he wanted to become a big-time farmer. In early March, Raymond went and bought a piece of land, as well as a mule, and began plowing the land and later planting cotton. Raymond got Essie and all of the other children to pick his cotton. Eventually, Essie had passed out from the intense heat and had to take a break from the hard labor.\n\nIn chapter seven, Essie started school again. Her and her family began picking pecans at Mr. Wheelers to get money for new school clothes. Shortly after, Essie found work at Miss Minnie's picking pecans and sweeping her floors. After pecan season ended, she began working for Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. The Jenkins just had their second child named Johnny. Toosweet finally married Raymond, without his mother's approval, nor her consent. Shortly after their marriage, Raymond and Toosweet had their third child together, Raymond Jr., but they called him Jerry.\n\nEssie Mae won a contest at school and was crowned homecoming queen. At the time she didn't have much money and did not want the hand-me-down gown that her employer, Mrs. Jenkins, offered her at the time. In her last effort, she wrote to her father. She met with her father for the first time in many years and was given a beautiful dress for the parade.\n\nIt was in chapter nine where Essie discovered her legal name. Essie received her birth certificate in the mail, which had the wrong name. The name that was on the certificate was Anne Moody. After a great deal of convincing, Toosweet allowed her to change her name, although Toosweet wasn't entirely on board.\n\nAnne and her rival in class, Darlene, always fought to have the better grade. One day, their teacher went over everyone's final grade, Darlene and Anne were on the edge of their seats; waiting to see who had the best grade. However, they both fell short. Betty Posey, a classmate, received a better grade than the two girls.\n\nDue to Anne's employers having their second child, they built a home further away and moved there shortly after. Anne found a job working for Mrs. Jenkins mother, Mrs. Burke, whom she didn't like. Anne took up this job, regardless of how much she disliked Mrs. Jenkins mother, because Toosweet had her fourth child with Raymond, and the baby was named Ralph. With another mouth to feed and Raymond being unemployed, Annie felt obligated to do her part.\n\nChapter ten was all in regard to Emmett Till's murder. Toosweet demanded that Anne act as if she didn't know a thing of Emmett Till's murder. When Anne would ask her mother about the boy's death, her mother refused to tell her. No one would explain to Anne about the murder of this dear boy. Until she asked her teacher, Mrs. Rice. Mrs. Rice explained a lot to Anne, not only about Emmett Till, but also about the NAACP. She was later fired, and Anne had no explanation as to why.\n\nSince the Emmett Till murder, strange things began to happen near Anne's hometown. Anne's classmate was beaten, and an entire family was burned to death. Anne desperately needed to get away from it all, and so she left for the summer. She quit working for Mrs. Burke and moved in with her uncle Ed for the summer.\n\nAnne's first job for the summer was housekeeping for a poor white family. Later, the family left unexpectedly and didn't pay her for any of her work that week. A friend of Anne's got her a job at a Café, that Anne received by lying and saying she was over the age of 18 and out of school. However, when her employer discovered these lies, she was fired. Once Anne returned home, she took on many hobbies to distract her from everything.\n\nOnce Anne was back home, she began working for Mrs. Burke again, where she grew intimately interested in her son, Wayne. Anne tutored Wayne and his friends for extra cash. One evening, Mrs. Burke accused Junior, Anne's brother, of stealing and shook him down. Anne later quit and began working for Mrs. Hunt, whom she worked for until she moved into her aunt's house in New Orleans for the summer.\n\nOnce at her aunts, Anne tried looking for a waitress job for about a month, but as much as she tried, she came up short. Anne reluctantly began working at a chicken factory for about a month. Anne's aunt called the work slave work. Black people protested outside of the factory each day she worked there. Anne later found a job substituting for a dishwasher at a restaurant. She stayed working there and worked herself up to a bus girl, and later became a waitress.\n\nIn chapter 16, Toosweet's husband and Anne's stepfather, Raymond began eyeing her. Once Anne recognized this for what it was, she moved in with her father and her stepmother, Emma. While living under her father's roof, one-night Emma's sister, Janie, was fighting with her husband, Wilbert, who was armed with a gun. In the process of protecting Janie, Emma's foot was almost shot clean off. Emma began acting differently once home out of the hospital, due to becoming handicapped. Later in this chapter Anne finally graduated high school and planned to move back to New Orleans and get back her restaurant job.\n\nIn 1969, \"Coming of Age in Mississippi\" received the Brotherhood Award from the National Council of Christians and Jews, and the Best Book of the Year Award from the National Library Association. In 1972, Moody worked as an artist-in-residence in Berlin. She went on to work at Cornell and in 1975, released a collection of short stories, titled \"Mr. Death: Four Stories\". One of the stories, \"New Hope for the Seventies\", won the silver award from \"Mademoiselle\" magazine.\n\nShe and Austin Straus divorced in 1977. Moody declined to make public appearances or grant interviews, with one exception: the above-mentioned interview with Debra Spencer, in 1985. Moody was absent from the spotlight during and after the civil rights movement, partly because she (like many people) needed time to heal from the physical and psychological wounds received during those efforts. She lived in New York City, worked as a counselor for the New York City Poverty Program, and had been working on a book, \"The Clay Gully\", prior to her death.\n\n"}
{"id": "2098847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098847", "title": "Sri Lankan Portuguese creole", "text": "Sri Lankan Portuguese creole\n\nSri Lanka Indo-Portuguese, Ceylonese Portuguese Creole or Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC) is a language spoken in Sri Lanka. While the predominant languages of the island are Sinhala and Tamil, the interaction of the Portuguese and the Sri Lankans led to the evolution of a new language, Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), which flourished as a \"lingua franca\" on the island for over 350 years (16th to mid-19th centuries). SLPC continues to be spoken by an unknown, extremely small population. All speakers of SLPC are members of the Burgher community: descendants of the Portuguese and Dutch who founded families in Sri Lanka. Europeans, Eurasians and Burghers account for 0.2% of the Sri Lankan population. Though only a small group of people actually continue to speak SLPC, Portuguese cultural traditions are still in wide practice by many Sri Lankans who are neither of Portuguese descent nor Roman Catholics. SLPC is associated with the Sri Lanka Kaffir people, an ethnic minority group. SLPC has been considered the most important creole dialect in Asia because of its vitality and the influence of its vocabulary on the Sinhalese language. Lexical borrowing from Portuguese can be observed in many areas of the Sinhalese language. Portuguese influence has been so deeply absorbed into daily Sri Lankan life and behavior that these traditions will likely continue into perpetuity.\n\nIn 1517, the Portuguese, attracted by the island's spices and strategic position (midway between their holdings on the west coast of India and Malacca), sent an expedition from Goa to establish a trading post at Colombo. They introduced Christianity to the island, and granted special favors to those who converted. Using the unstable political situation on the island to their advantage, the Portuguese soon gained the position of guardians of the nominal monarch of southern Sri Lanka. In 1557, Dharmapala, who was the king at Kotte, near Colombo, and had suzerainty over Kandy and Jaffna (the other two kingdoms) was baptized Dom João Dharmapala breaking a 1,850-year-old tradition as a Christian king sat on the Sinhalese throne. Several Sri Lankan aristocrats and others followed the King and converted. In 1597, Dharmapala, the last king of the Kotte, died childless, and willed his realm to Philip I, king of Portugal. In 1617, with the annexation of Jaffna, Portuguese authority extended over the entire lowland zone. Catholicism continued to spread, but the Portuguese did not train an indigenous clergy, so it was simply a microcosm of the church in Portugal.\n\nThe Dutch were in contact with the Kandyan court as early as 1602, but it wasn't until 1632 that the Kandyan monarch, Raja Sinha II, invited Dutch cooperation in expelling the Portuguese from the island. A long period of conflict ensued, including the Dutch takeover of Batticaloa in 1638, and ending with the fall of Mannar and Jaffna in 1658. When Raja Sinha II realized that the Dutch were not about to deliver their new conquests to him, the alliance quickly dissolved into enmity. The Dutch East India Company was primarily interested in commercial profits and resisted engaging in costly military operations against Kandy. During the Dutch reign, 1761–1766, was the only period of outright war. The Dutch also maltreated the Catholics and forced conversions to the Calvinist faith, the Catholic Church fell to its foundations as Catholic marriages, practice of the faith, and priests were forbidden by the Dutch. Catholics met secretly at each other's homes to practice their faith. At this time, the Catholic Church may have disappeared completely in Sri Lanka had it not been for the work of Goan priests who came to the island to save Catholicism.\n\nThe Portuguese reached India in 1498, before coming to Sri Lanka in 1505. By that time a distinct pidgin of Portuguese had probably begun to develop, and this was used as the basis for communication with the new territory’s inhabitants. There is very little documented evidence of the linguistic situation at the time, however, it is clear that by the early 17th century a Portuguese-based pidgin was in use in the Portuguese controlled littoral, and was not unknown in the kingdom of Kandy because of its frequent dealings with outsiders. Also, a creole community had been established consisting of two groups or creole speakers: the Topazes (Tupasses, mestiços, etc.), \"dark-skinned or half-cast people claiming Portuguese descent, and Christian profession, and Kaffirs (Caffres, etc.), or Bantus\".\n\nThe Topazes were children of local or half-caste mothers and Portuguese or half-caste fathers. They would have been exposed to pidgin/creole Portuguese at home. They identified with Portuguese, a natural occurrence, considering that the Portuguese were at the apex of the social order, though they probably had local family ties as well. The Portuguese brought Bantu slaves (Kaffirs) to Sri Lanka from the eastern African Great Lakes region. These people would have spoken pidgin Portuguese, and it is likely that many were native creole speakers, but maybe not of the Sri Lanka variety. Because they mainly served as domestic servants, they would have introduced the very young children of Casados (married men who had come with their Portuguese wives as settlers to Sri Lanka) to the pidgin/creole. There may have also been children of chance unions of Portuguese or Topazes with Kaffirs, but it is unclear which group they would have belonged to.\n\nSri Lanka was a Dutch colony from 1658 to 1796. During this time there was Dutch influence on the language, and possibly the development of a Portuguese–Dutch Creole. There may still be a few speakers of this in Wattala, a suburb of Colombo. However, the majority of Dutch Burghers spoke Dutch, Portuguese, English, or Portuguese Creole.\n\nToday, the language is spoken by descendants of Topazes and Casados, the Portuguese Burgher community, in the Eastern towns of Batticaloa (Koolavaddy, Mamangam, Uppodai, Dutch Bar, Akkaraipattu) and Trincomalee (Palayuttu). However, there are also speakers among the Kaffirs, descendants of Bantu slaves, in the Northwestern province, in Puttalam and in Mannar. Additionally, in the village of Wahakotte near Galewala, in central Sri Lanka, there is a small community of Catholics with partial Portuguese ancestry, where the language was spoken until two generations ago.\n\nBatticaloa is a medium-sized coastal town in the Eastern Province that has always been an isolated outpost, and has been able to retain many ancient habits. This isolation has been a factor in the preservation of SLPC, but very little information exists about the town’s history. Tamil speakers are the overwhelming majority, but there is also a concentrated community of SLPC speaking Burghers. In the early part of the century most Burghers lived close to the center of the town, but more recently, many have moved to outlying areas. All of the Burghers in Batticaloa speak Tamil, many of them better than they do SLPC, and some also speak Sinhala and/or English. The group has no contact with any other creole speakers on the island, and the creole has for a long time been losing ground to Tamil. Currently, decreasing competence can be observed over successive generations: the younger a Burgher, the less likely they are to know the creole, and if they can speak it, their speech exhibits more Tamil features than that of their parents. Members of the burgher community are in constant interaction with Tamil speakers as they live, work, play, study, and worship together. Burgher children learn Tamil at the same time that they learn the creole. It is difficult to determine how many of Batticaloa’s Burghers speak SLPC, but most probably understand it, though in many homes Tamil has become the predominant language.\n\nThe language is facing extinction, as it is now only used at home and few are able to speak it well. Throughout Sri Lanka many SLPC speakers have emigrated to other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and Europe. There are still 100 Burgher families in Batticaloa and Trincomalee and 80 Kaffir families in Puttalam that speak the language. SLPC was very prominent in the past, continuing to be in use despite predictions that it would die out, but current prospects for its survival are equally as bleak as in the past.\n\nAn early sample of the language was collected by Hugh Nevill, a British civil servant stationed in Sri Lanka in the late 19th century. Among his large collection of oriental manuscripts is the \"Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Manuscript\", containing over a thousand verses and a long text in prose.\n\nPrecise phonological knowledge of the Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC) is limited. The earliest analysis of the language comes from the 19th and early 20th centuries, but since the research was based purely on written data, it lacks insight on how speech was actually produced. The only complete study that includes phonological analysis of native speakers seems to be Ian R Smith’s thesis which was published in 1978. His research surveyed the Creole-speaking people living in the Batticaloa area of Sri Lanka. It can be assumed, unless otherwise indicated, that the phonological information about SLPC in the section on vowels and consonants is solely from his thesis, due to the lack of similar resources of a precise nature.\n\nVowels\nStandard Portuguese (SP) has rich vowel phonology with seven to nine oral vowels (depending on which dialect), five nasal vowels, ten oral diphthongs and five nasal diphthongs. While SLPC has retained the same oral vowels found in Standard Continental Portuguese, it does not make the distinction between nasalized and non-nasalized vowels. While the vowels are derived from Portuguese, the vowel features appear more similar to Tamil, since in both Tamil and the Creole vowels are distinguished by length. \nWord internal sequences of two vowels do not occur in SLPC, therefore the creole does not appear to have diphthongs as there are in SP. Again, vowel lengthening seems to take place instead of diphthongization.\n\nChart A shows a vowel chart for SP, where nasality is distinguished from oral vowels, and a vowel chart for SLPC, where vowel length is a distinctive feature. Chart (B) shows both long vowels (such as the word for ‘wax’, , from BrP ‘cerar’) and short vowels (such as in the word for ‘want’, , from BrP ‘querer’).\n\nBesides the distinction between vowel length and vowel nasality, the place of stress on vowels distinguishes SP and SLPC. Both Batticaloan Tamil and the SLPC have entirely predictable stress² patterns whereas SP does not. While stress is predictable, it is not simply a surface phenomenon, so it must be represented lexically. \nA few rules about stress in SLPC:\n1. Either short or long vowels can take on stress, but long vowels always carry stress. \n2. A word can contain only one phonetically long vowel, but numerous unstressed short vowels. \n3. Short vowels can be stressed only when found in initial syllables.\n4. Stress falls on the last underlying long vowel of a word, or on the first vowel of a word having no long vowel.\nStress is important as it relates to the phonological changes that occur in the Creole. For instance, there is [vowel reduction] by way of prominence reduction of unstressed vowels. This means that relatively long vowels in an unstressed position are replaced by shorter vowels of a similar quality.⁶ :So, as a general rule, low and mid-vowels are contrastive under stress in SLPC, but neutralized and given the features of a mid-vowel when not stressed. Another way to say this is that through a pattern of neutralization, high [sonority] vowels are eliminated in SLPC. The pattern of vowel reduction is shown in Table (1) below:\n\nOther phonological processes vowels of SLPC demonstrate are epenthesis and elision. Neither is a very common phenomena, however, so they will only be dealt with briefly. The insertion of epenthetic occurs to prevent the formation of certain consonant clusters that are atypical. One example of this is seen when the verb ‘to judge’ or , is nominalized. This is done by the suffix , which requires an epenthetic when added to the stem , because the potentially resulting consonant cluster of does not regularly occur in the language. Therefore the combination of the stem, the epenthetic and the suffix yields the form , where the is inserted in-between the and the .\nSince word medial sequences of two or more vowels do not occur in Sri Lanka, as mentioned earlier, a process of vowel elision and glide epenthesis can co-occur to prevent vowels from coming together. Firstly, when there exists a possible combination of two vowels as result of some sort of word construction a glide separates them. Secondly, as a result of this the first vowel of the two may be reduced or elided.\nA) Standard Portuguese\n\nB)Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole\n\nConsonants\nSLPC uses several manners of consonant articulation which are not found in SP. Since this Creole do does express influence from Batticaloa Tamil, English, and Dutch (particularly via loan words.) It is difficult to determine where some of these segments have been loaned from. For instance, the closed front rounded vowel is considered a glide in SLPC and does not behave this way in Tamil or Portuguese. It seems to have evolved for the high front vowel \n\nAs mentioned earlier, SLPC seems to have an affinity for gemination of vowels resulting in a distinction between short and long vowels. As for consonants, there is also a tendency to geminate all voiceless consonants after a short stressed vowel. However, all tense consonants can optionally become geminate. For instance, in the word (lock), the can become stressed and geminate, to achieve the pronunciation . Similarly, word (bag) can become which can be achieved by the simple rule:\ncodice_1.\n\nSri Lankan Portuguese Creole\nStandard Portuguese\n\nLike many [[Creole language|creoles]], SLPC is made up of [[lexical item]]s from an array of different sources. There is, of course, much influence from the [[indigenous languages]] like Tamil and Sinhala. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] had a vast impact on this creole, and there are also traces of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and English. It was also most likely influenced by other creoles and varieties of [[Indo-Portuguese]], as the island was visited frequently by traders from [[Goa]] and other Portuguese settlements like [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], and [[Diu, India|Diu]]. The similarities with other Indo-Portuguese creoles may also be, however, due to similar circumstances and traits of the languages from which they stem. There is also some [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] influences and loan words.\n\nExample of Portuguese origin words (traced back to Latin origin)\n\n-nariz = nose -Portuguese nariz\n-besos = lips -Portuguese beiços (lips)\n-kum = with -Portuguese com\n-hum(a) = ‘one,’ ‘a/an’ -Portuguese um(a)\n-sumana = week -Portuguese semana\n-mael = honey -Portuguese mel\nExample of Portuguese origin words\n-meo = middle -Portuguese meio\n-cam = ground, floor -Portuguese chão\n-almuça = breakfast -Portuguese almoço (lunch)\n-fome = hunger -Portuguese fome\n-basu = low -Portuguese baixo\nExample of Dutch origin words\n-krel = curl -Dutch krul\n-rol = roll -Dutch rollen\n-gorgel = throat -Dutch gorgel\n-ruvin = ruin -Dutch ruïne (ruin) -Portuguese ruína (ruin)\n\nExample of Tamil / Sinhala origin words \n-pepiya = speak -Tamil pepiya \n-podiyas = children -Sinhala podi (small) -Batticaloa Tamil potiyan (small boy) \n-nona = lady -Sinhala nona -from Portuguese dona (lady) \n-sarayatiya = walking stick -Sinhala sarayatiya\n\nThe normal sentence structure of standard Portuguese (SP) is subject verb object (SVO). In Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), SVO dominates, but SOV and OSV also occur. The syntax structure is similar to that of Tamil.

{"id": "2098871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098871", "title": "Salus Populi Romani", "text": "Salus Populi Romani\n\nSalus Populi Romani (\"Protectress\", or more literally \"health\" or \"salvation\", \"of the Roman People\") is a Roman Catholic title associated with the venerated image of the Virgin Mary in Rome. This Byzantine icon of the Madonna and Christ Child holding a Gospel book is kept in the Borghese (Pauline) Chapel of the Basilica of Saint Mary Major.\n\nThe image arrived in Rome in the year 590 AD during the reign of Pope Gregory I. Pope Gregory XVI granted the image a Canonical Coronation on 15 August 1838 through the Papal bull \"Cælestis Regina\". Pope Pius XII crowned the image again and ordered a public religious procession during the Marian year of 1954. The image was cleaned and restored by the Vatican Museum in 2018.\n\nThe phrase \"Salus Populi Romani\" goes back to the legal system and pagan rituals of the ancient Roman Republic. After the legalisation of Christianity by Emperor Constantine the Great through the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, the phrase was sanctioned as a Marian title for the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe image is held to have arrived from Crete in the year 590 AD during the Pontificate of Pope Gregory the Great, who welcomed the image in person on its arrival borne with a floral boat from the Tiber river. For centuries it was placed above the door to the baptistery chapel of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (considered the third of the Roman patriarchal basilicas) where in the year 1240 it began to be called \"Regina Caeli\" (English: \"Queen of Heaven\") in an official document. Later it was moved to the nave, and from the 13th century it was preserved in a marble tabernacle. Since 1613 it has been located in the altar tabernacle of the Cappella Paolina that was built specifically for it, later known to English-speaking pilgrims as the \"Lady Chapel\". The church and its Marian shrine are under the special patronage of the popes.\n\nFrom at least the 15th century, it was honored as a miraculous image, and it was later used by the Jesuit Order in particular to foster devotion to the Mother of God through the Sodality of Our Lady movement.\n\nThe image is one of the so-called \"Luke images\" believed to have been painted from real life by Saint Luke himself. According to the legend:\n\nThe Roman Breviary states, \"After the Council of Ephesus (431) in which the Mother of Jesus was acclaimed as Mother of God, Pope Sixtus III erected at Rome on the Esquiline Hill, a basilica dedicated to the honor of the Holy Mother of God. It was afterward called Saint Mary Major and it is the oldest church in the West dedicated to the honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"\n\nThe Roman Pontifical gives the following account:\n\n The image is five feet high by three and a quarter feet wide (117 x 79 cm) – very large for an icon, especially one with an early date. It is painted on a thick cedar panel. Mary wears a gold-trimmed, dark blue mantle over a purple/red tunic. The letters in Greek at the top identify Mary as \"Mother of God\" (Μήτηρ Θεοῦ in lower case and ΜHΤHΡ ΘΕΟΥ in upper case), as is usual in Byzantine art (Christ may originally have had an inscription under later re-painting). Christ is holding a book in his left hand, presumably a Gospel Book. His right hand is raised in a blessing, and it is Mary not he who looks directly out at the viewer. \nThe folded together position of Mary's hands distinguishes this image as a version of the earlier type from before the development of the iconography of the Hodegetria image in the 10th century, where she points to Christ with her right hand. \"Rather than offering the Child, she keeps his body closer to hers and seeks physical and tactile contact with him.\" However the few other examples of this type do not have the Virgin's hands folded together – the right hand holds Christ's knee.\n\nThe Virgin holding in her right hand a \"mappa\" (or \"mappula\", a sort of embroidered ceremonial handkerchief), originally a consular symbol, later an imperial one, means this image is probably one of the type showing Mary as \"Regina coeli\" or \"Queen of Heaven\". In addition, the Virgin also wears a plain, golden, ring band in her middle finger of her right hand, later obscured by a gemstone. The image no longer wears its Canonical crowns and jeweled regalia, which has now been transferred in the treasury of the sacristy of Saint Peter’s Basilica.\n\nThe image \"has been confidently dated to almost every possible period between the fifth century and the thirteenth\". The recent full-length study by Gerhard Wolf says, cautiously, that it is \"probably Late Antique\" in its original form.\n\nThe icon in its current state of overpainting seems to be a work of the 13th century (as witnessed by the features of the faces), but other layers visible under the top one suggest it is a repainting of a much earlier piece; especially revealing is the modeling of Child's right hand in the first layer, which can be compared to other early Christian icons that display 'Pompeian' illusionistic qualities. The areas of linear stylization, such as Christ's garment which is rendered in golden hatching producing a flat effect, seem to go back to the 8th century, and can be compared with a very early icon of Elijah from Mount Sinai. A second restoration process started around 1100 and came to an end in the 13th century. The Virgin's blue mantle which is wrapped over her purple dress was severely altered in the outline; the red halos are also not part of the original image.\n\nThe image type itself suggests it is not a medieval invention, but rather an Early Christian concept dating from antiquity: a majestic, half-length portrait showing a frank outward gaze of the rulerlike Virgin, with her upright, stately pose and folded hands gently clasping the Child, unique among all icons. Lively turning of the maturely developed and attired Child also attests to the painting's antiquity. The vivid contrapposto of the two bodies, which suggests direct observation, can be compared with a 5th-century Mount Sinai icon of the Virgin and Child in Kiev, and contrasted with the Pantheon Marian icon from 609, which already shows the Mother slightly subordinated to the Child by the imploring gesture and the turn of the head, and where the interaction of the bodies exists only in a flat plane. These comparisons suggest a date of the 7th century for the icon.\n\nThe early fame of the icon can be gauged from the production of replicas (a fresco in Santa Maria Antiqua seems to have reproduced it already in the 8th century), and the role it played in the ritual on the feast of the Virgin's Assumption, where the \"Acheiropoieta\" (the panel painting of Christ from the Lateran Basilica) was moved in a procession to Santa Maria Maggiore to 'meet' with it. Monneret de Villard has shown that engravings of this icon brought by Jesuits to Ethiopia influenced the art of that country from the 17th century onwards, repeating \"every detail of her own and the Child's posture, the position of the hands being especially characteristic.\" More far flung apparent copies include a Moghul miniature, presumably based on a copy given to Akbar by the Jesuits, and copies in China, of which a 16th-century example is in the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nThe image has been venerated by several Popes and acted as a Roman Catholic Mariological symbol, for the city of Rome and its peoples.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Vatican Museum was tasked with the full restoration and conservation process of the venerated image. The restoral process included the following conservations:\n\n\nThe process was completed within a year and was given the honor of a Pontifical Mass by Pope Francis on 28 January 2018, on the anniversary of the translation of the icon to its new permanent shrine.\n\nSalus Populi Romani is also said to be the source of the title \"Mater ter Admirabilis\" (Mother Thrice Admirable) used for the Blessed Virgin Mary within the Schoenstatt Marian Movement.\n\nSalus Populi Romani was the centerpiece of the \"Colloquium Marianum\" in Ingolstadt, in 1604. According to the Schoenstatt, on 6 April 1604, Father Jakob Rem, SJ, desired to know which of the invocations from the litany of Loreto would please the Virgin Mary the most. He reported that after meditation and looking at the image of Salus Populi Romani, the title \"Mother Thrice Admirable\" was revealed to him.\n\nThe title \"Mother Thrice Admirable\" has since become part of the Schoenstatt Movement and is also associated with another well known Madonna, namely the 1898 Refugium Peccatorum Madonna by the Italian artist Luigi Crosio which was purchased by the Schoenstatt Sisters in Switzerland in 1964 and has since been called the Mother Thrice Admirable Madonna.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2098872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098872", "title": "Headquarters (The Monkees album)", "text": "Headquarters (The Monkees album)\n\nHeadquarters is the third album issued by the Monkees and the first with substantial songwriting and instrumental performances by members of the group itself, rather than by session musicians and professional songwriters. After a struggle for creative autonomy with their record label, the group had been allowed, to a degree, to record by themselves. \"Headquarters\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and was certified double platinum in the United States with sales of more than two million copies within the first two months of release. It peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts. It is included in the 2006 book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nWhile the original concept of their third album was to follow the same format and production of the first two albums, after the release of \"More of the Monkees\" the group was becoming increasingly frustrated by the limited creative input they were allowed by Don Kirshner, and continued to fight for more creative control and independence from him. Kirshner had already begun supervising recording sessions with studio musicians for their third album, with Davy Jones recording vocal tracks for some of the songs, while the group recorded two songs featuring them both singing \"and\" playing (\"All of Your Toys\" and \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\"), for their next single. The hope was to pacify the group, particularly Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork, by gaining some of the input they were asking for, even though the track would feature as the b-side, with the a-side featuring one of the aforementioned Jones-vocal tracks. Tensions came to a head when Kirshner released the third single (in Canada), with Jones tracks on \"both\" sides (\"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" and an early version of \"She Hangs Out\"), completely ignoring the group's request, and without the approval of record executives. This was the last straw and it led to Kirshner's dismissal from the Monkees project and the group was finally given full creative control of their next album. The single was withdrawn from Canada and pulled from scheduled release in the US. Since \"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" was already announced as the next single, it was retained as the a-side and \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" as the b-side (a publishing error prevented \"All of Your Toys\" from being used), replacing \"She Hangs Out\". The remaining Kirshner-supervised tracks that had already been finished were discarded.\n\nThe album was released on May 22, 1967 and charted at No. 1 in the U.S., only to be replaced the following week by the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". But it then began a run of 11 consecutive weeks at the No. 2 position as \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Headquarters\" became the top two selling records during the legendary \"Summer of Love\" period. \n\nThe album was issued on the compact disc format for the first time by Arista Records in 1989, remixed from the multi-tracks, then later from the original stereo mastertape in 1995 with several bonus tracks on Rhino Entertainment. In 2000, Rhino, through its Rhino Handmade division, issued \"The Headquarters Sessions\", a 3-disc box set of outtakes from the session as well as the album's original monophonic mix presented in an alternate running order that was rejected before release.\n\nIn 2007, Rhino issued a two-disc deluxe edition of the album. The CD set was housed in a digipak with a slipcase and featured original album artwork (including replicas of the original Colgems vinyl labels on each disc), as well as a booklet of essays and session information by Monkees historian Andrew Sandoval. The discs contained both the stereo and mono mixes of the album, remastered, as well as alternate mixes and outtakes.\n\nThe original rear album cover features a collage of photos including one of the band with producer Chip Douglas and engineer Dick Bogert. However the photo was mislabeled: it identifies Hank Cicalo as sitting next to Chip Douglas. This is known as the \"Producers Cover\". Colgems/RCA corrected the error by substituting a different photo rather than revising the caption. Peter, Micky and Mike were sporting light beards while Davy's shoulder-length hair had been cut off; this has come to be known as the \"Beard Cover\". This is the corrected version because it was standard practice for RCA to add an \"RE\" to the catalog number when any one side of a record sleeve had a revision. The \"Beard Cover\" has a catalog number of COS/COM-103 RE.\n\nThe album's preliminary track lineup was compiled shortly after the sessions had ended and would have included the following songs:\n\nSide 1\n\nSide 2\n\n\"Tracks 1-14: Original album in stereo\"\n\nDisc one\n\n\"Tracks 1-14: Original Album in Stereo\"\n\nDisc two\n\n\"Tracks 1-14: Original Album in Mono\"\n\nThe Monkees\n\nAdditional musicians and production staff'\n\nDuring the early months of 1967, the four Monkees sequestered themselves in the RCA Victor Music Center of the World Studios, on Sunset Boulevard near Vine Street in Hollywood. Many of the songs were written by the four group members, or came together organically in jam sessions. A few of the songs were also written by songwriters Boyce and Hart. Michael Nesmith recruited fellow folk musician Chip Douglas, a member of The Modern Folk Quartet and The Turtles, to produce the album. Douglas, credited under his birth name, Douglas Farthing Hatlelid, also contributed bass guitar and a song.\n\n\"You Told Me\"\n\n\"I'll Spend My Life with You\"\n\n\"Forget That Girl\"\n\n\"Band 6\"\n\n\"You Just May Be the One\"\n\n\"Shades of Gray\"\n\n\"I Can't Get Her Off My Mind\"\n\n\"For Pete's Sake\"\n\n\"Mr. Webster\"\n\n\"Sunny Girlfriend\"\n\n\"Zilch\"\n\n\"No Time\"\n\n\"Early Morning Blues and Greens\"\n\n\"Randy Scouse Git\"\n\nSeveral instrumental jams (available on \"The Headquarters Sessions\") were taped by Chip Douglas which The Monkees apparently intended for inclusion on the album. The group (with bassist John London) jammed an instrumental cover of the song \"Memphis Tennessee\" in which Peter's guitar grooving (and some of London's bass work and Davy's tambourine) overshoots the ending; after Micky good-naturedly curses out Peter (\"Aw, Peter! You had to screw it up!\") and bashes his drums for effect, he decides, \"We'll cut him off, just cut off the track (for the ending),\" to which Mike replies, \"No, don't cut off the track, it was groovy until [the ending].\" Following this jam the group broke into a ferocious three-minute improvisation (dubbed \"Twelve-String Improvisation\" on \"The Headquarters Sessions\") led by Mike's take-off of the guitar riff from the Beatles' \"Day Tripper\" and quickly joined by Peter's riffing, Micky's drums, London's bass and Davy's tambourine. Following the jam Micky is heard laughing and says, \"Whoa! I gotta hear this!\" and Peter asks Douglas, \"Can we hear that back?\" while a surprised Mike says, \"Oh, they didn't tape that, did they?\"\n\nAnother instrumental track intended for the album was a rock number, \"Masking Tape\" (credited to Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil but authorship has also been listed as unknown) which the group recorded with bassist Jerry Yester. One take was recorded: before the take Micky and Chip Douglas run through one of the song's verses. At the end of the performance Micky exclaims, \"Whoa! That was it!\" but producer Douglas protests, \"No, that wasn't it, it slowed down in the middle, but it's getting close.\" For some reason the song was never finished.\n\nPeter, Mike, Micky and his sister Coco recorded demos early in the sessions. Peter's demo of \"Seeger's Theme\" was instrumental, while Mike's and the Dolenzes' demos (\"Nine Times Blue\" and the Buffy Saint Marie composition \"Until It's Time for You to Go\" by Mike (who had first released it as a single in 1965); \"She'll Be There\" and \"Midnight Train\" by Micky and Coco) featured full vocals over acoustic guitar. Mike and the Dolenzes' demos took place in one session, as before Mike's demo of \"Until It's Time\" Chip Douglas is heard teasing that Mike is demoing under his old pseudonym 'Michael Blessing' to the laughter of Micky and Coco.\n\n\"All of Your Toys\" (Early Mono Mix)\n\n\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" (Second Recorded Version + Mono Mix)\n\n\"Peter Gunn's Gun\" (Jam Session)\n\n\"Jericho\" (Studio Dialogue + Mono)\n\n\"Nine Times Blue\" (Demo Version + Mono)\n\n\"She'll Be There\" (Acoustic Duet + Mono)\n\n\"Midnight Train\" (Demo Version + Mono)\n\n\"Pillow Time\" (Studio Dialogue + Mono)\n\n\"all tracks produced by Chip Douglas unless otherwise specified.\"\n\n\"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" (Stereo Remix)\n\n\"She Hangs Out\" (Single Version + Stereo Remix)\n\"Love to Love\" (Alternate Stereo Remix)\n\n\"You Can't Tie a Mustang Down\" (Stereo Remix)\n\n\"If I Learned to Play the Violin\" (Stereo Remix)\n\n\"99 Pounds\" (Stereo Remix)\n\n\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" (Single Version + Stereo Remix)\n\n\"Tema Dei Monkees\" (Stereo Remix)\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "2098888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098888", "title": "Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars", "text": "Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars\n\nThe Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) were a series of conflicts fought principally in Northern Italy between the French Revolutionary Army and a Coalition of Austria, Russia, Piedmont-Sardinia, and a number of other Italian states.\n\nThe War of the First Coalition broke out in autumn 1792, when several European powers formed an alliance against Republican France. The first major operation was the annexation of Nice (part of the Duchy of Savoy) by 30,000 French troops. This was reversed in mid-1793, when the Republican forces were withdrawn to deal with a revolt in Lyon, triggering a counter-invasion of Savoy by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia (a member of the First Coalition). After the revolt in Lyon had been suppressed, the French under General Kellermann managed to push back the Piedmontese with just 12,000 troops, winning engagements at Argentines and St Maurice in September and October 1793. \n\nThe conflict soon escalated with Austrian and Neapolitan forces being mobilised for an invasion of southern France to recover Nice and strike into Provence. The Allied forces were bolstered by some 45,000 Austrians, Piedmontese, and Neapolitans, with additional support from the British Royal Navy. Before the Allies could launch this assault the French, under tactical command of André Masséna, launched the Saorgio Offensive (April, 1794), which was planned by the army's artillery commander, General Napoleon Bonaparte. This two-pronged French offensive drove back the Allied force, despite their strong positions, and firmly captured the mountain passes that led into Piedmont. A new offensive, again devised by General Bonaparte, was similarly successful despite its more complicated nature, calling for the co-ordination of the Army of Italy and the Army of the Alps.\n\nFurther French assaults on the Allied positions were called off under orders from war minister Carnot, who was concerned about supply lines being cut by rebels behind the front. The commanders in the field were unhappy about this decision, but appeals were interrupted by the overthrow of the Committee of Public Safety and its leader, Maximilien de Robespierre (28 July 1794). During the political chaos that ensued in the French army, the Allies launched an assault on Savona. Ignoring Carnot's orders, the commander of the Army of Italy launched a counter-offensive and secured supply routes to Genoa following victory at the First Battle of Dego. Following this the French consolidated the front and awaited further opportunities.\n\nThe main focus of the war then shifted north to the Rhine, until 29 June 1795, when the Austrians launched an attack against the depleted and poorly supplied French Army of Italy. Nominally 107,000-strong, the Army of Italy could only manage to field an effective force of about 30,000. Kellermann, who had resumed command, appealed to Carnot for reinforcements. Instead, General Bonaparte was appointed to the general staff where he devised a third plan for an attack towards Vado and Ceva. Kellermann was replaced by General Schérer soon after and he carried out the attacks, gaining victory at Loano.\n\nFollowing a short respite in hostilities Schérer resigned and Bonaparte was appointed commander-in-chief on 2 March 1796. The motives for Bonaparte's appointment were most likely political. On 9 March, Bonaparte had married Joséphine de Beauharnais, who had shared her imprisonment (under Robespierre) with the woman who had become wife to Tallien, one of the then Directors of the French Republic. It was \"universally believed\" that Josephine had been introduced by her friend to the First Director, Barras, and had become his lover.\nJosephine's letters claim Barras had promised the command to Bonaparte, before she'd consented to marry him.\nBarras is cited by his colleagues as saying of Bonaparte, \"Advance this man or he will advance himself without you.\" Bonaparte had shown himself to be highly ambitious and had made a name for himself following 13 Vendémiaire in 1795. By placing him in command of the Army of Italy, Bonaparte was being assigned to an obscure front: of the Republic's thirteen principal field armies, the Italian force was the most neglected and was in terrible condition when Bonaparte arrived. \n\nBonaparte launched attacks almost immediately after he arrived on the front on 27 March. His 37,000 men and 60 guns were facing more than 50,000 Allied troops in the theatre. His only chance of support came from Kellermann's Army of the Alps, which was faced by a further 20,000 Allied troops. Bonaparte had no chance of gaining reinforcements as the Republican war effort was being concentrated on the massive offensives planned on the Rhine.\n\nAt the Battle of Montenotte Bonaparte defeated the Austrians and fought a second engagement around Dego soon after. Following these battles he launched an all-out invasion of Piedmont and won a further victory at Mondovì. Piedmont was forced to accept the Armistice of Cherasco on 28 April, knocking it out of the war and the First Coalition. It had taken Bonaparte just a month to defeat Piedmont (between his arrival and the armistice), a country which had resisted the French armies for over three years. Total losses during the lightning campaign were 6,000 French troops and over 25,000 Allied.\n\nBonaparte reorganised his newly enthused army following the short let-up in operations that followed Piedmont's defeat. Following this he manoeuvred his army into more opportune positions along the Po River. A small French victory at Codogno led to a retreat by Coalition forces across the Adda River. At the river, the Austrian army of General Beaulieu was defeated in the Battle of Lodi on 10 May. \n\nThe Army of Italy was now reinforced to almost 50,000 men and Bonaparte continued on the offensive, striking at Austrian forces mobilising in the vicinity of the fortress of Mantua. A series of minor Coalition defeats resulted in the garrison at Mantua being reinforced to 12,000. Placing Mantua under siege, Bonaparte then led a French division south to invade and occupy Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States, defeating Papal forces at Fort Urban.\nNext he turned north and with 20,000 men defeated some 50,000 Austrians under Field Marshal Wurmser at the battles of Lonato and Castiglione. The Austrian commander was forced back into the Alps. \n\nWurmser was reinforced once again to compensate for some 20,000 losses sustained in the past two months and made an attempt to relieve the siege of Mantua. Some 45,000 Austrian troops were left behind to guard against any new French offensive whilst the main body of the Austrian army moved on Mantua. At Rovereto on 4 September, Bonaparte inflicted a heavy defeat on the Austrians and was then well-placed to strike at the rear of Wurmser's army. Reacting slowly to this new threat, the Austrians were again defeated at the Battle of Bassano, where their army was reduced to just 12,000. The remaining troops marched rapidly towards Mantua, but became trapped there by General Masséna's advance party.\nAdditional Austrian forces arrived whilst Bonaparte's army was weakened by disease and his supply lines threatened by rebellion. Government political commissars, especially Cristoforo Saliceti, brutally put down the uprisings, but the French position was weakened. To stabilise the situation Bonaparte created the client states of Transpadane Republic and the Cispadane Republic.\n\nFollowing this a new Austrian commander, Joseph Alvinczy, arrived and made another attempt to relieve Mantua. Bonaparte drove back Alvinczy, but his counter-offensive was seriously hampered by Vaubois’ defeat over five days in the villages of Cembra and Calliano. Alvinczy held off a French attack at Caldiero on 12 November and Bonaparte was forced to withdraw. In the following three-day Battle of Arcole, Bonaparte won an important and surprising victory against Alvinczy. \n\nBoth sides were reinforced before Alvinczy launched another attack in January. Bonaparte defeated this renewed assault at the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting some 14,000 casualties. Then he surrounded and captured a second Austrian relief column near Mantua. Soon after, Mantua finally surrendered to the French, making it possible for the French to continue their advance eastwards towards Austria. After a brief campaign during which the Austrian army was commanded by the Emperor's brother, the Archduke Charles, the French advanced to within 100 miles of Vienna, and the Austrians sued for peace. Bonaparte's campaign was important in bringing an end to the War of the First Coalition.\n\nThe second phase of the war in Italy began in 1799 as part of the War of the Second Coalition and was different from the first in that Russian forces participated in the campaign. However, at the beginning of the conflict the Russians were yet to arrive. Bonaparte, meanwhile, was away from the continent, as from May, 1798 to September, 1799 he was leading the Egyptian Campaign.\n\nSome 60,000 French troops under Schérer faced off against an equal number of Austrians. An additional 50,000 Russians were expected to arrive shortly. The French were occupied with the pacification of Naples and this halved their effective strength to face the Austrians. In order to avoid a completely untenable situation arising, Schérer attacked as soon as possible in an attempt to preempt Austrian attacks. \nAustrian commander Pál Kray defeated the French at Verona and Magnano in late March and early April. Schérer retreated back and left a small detachment of 8,000 in several forts. The Austrian commander, Michael von Melas, was slow to pursue the retreating French and was soon replaced as overall Coalition commander in the theatre by the brilliant Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov. \n\nSchérer too was soon replaced by General Moreau, a man of greater fame and prestige. The French defeat at the Battle of Cassano on 26 April was followed by withdrawal from Lombardy and an overall unfavourable situation for the French. General Macdonald's army returned from Naples to support Moreau.\n\nAn initial Allied attack across the Po failed on 11 May. Moreau's army was in tatters with just 9,000 men remaining. An attempted counter-attack was beaten back by Russian General Petr Bagration. Suvorov soon occupied Turin and proclaimed the restoration of Piedmont to its king. \n\nThe Army of the Alps engaged the Austro-Russian forces in a series of minor skirmishes, but did not come to the rescue of the Army of Italy. Suvorov overran a number of French garrisons and continued his relentless advance. Macdonald engaged Suvorov in the Battle of the Trebbia and was crushed. Macdonald retreated with the remnant of his army to Genoa whilst Suvorov reached Novi. The Austrian high command ordered a halt to Allied offensives whilst the French garrisons of Mantua and Alessandria were overrun (see siege of Mantua and siege of Alessandria). Soon after this Moreau was dispatched to the Rhine and Joubert was sent to command the Army of Italy.\n\nSuvorov, acting under orders from the Coalition high command, paused to gather his strength for an offensive in Autumn. On 9 August, the French launched offensive of 38,000 men called the Battle of Novi. The offensive was thoroughly defeated by Suvorov, and resulted in the death of Joubert. Moreau, who had yet to depart for the Rhine, seized the initiative and led the survivors back to Genoa and began preparing a defence of the city. \nHowever at that time the Allied high command in Vienna ordered Suvorov to move out of Italy and concentrate on breaking through the Swiss front. The respite thus given the reeling Army of Italy led to a turning point in the war. Melas, who resumed command of Coalition forces in Italy, now almost exclusively Austrian, paused the offensive and consolidated his forces, now that the Russians had been removed from Italy. \n\nBy the spring of 1800 Russia had withdrawn entirely from the Coalition. The situation in Italy, however, was still very much on the side of the Coalition. Melas had some 100,000 men under his command, opposed by just 50,000 French troops who were thoroughly dispersed. The Allies prepared for a thrust into southern France and across the Rhine, much further north. Melas moved forward slowly, laying siege to Genoa and halting his advance elsewhere. \n\nIt was at this time that the First Consul of France, Napoleon Bonaparte (who had seized French power in the Brumaire Coup of 9 November 1799) led his Reserve Army through the Great St Bernard pass with the aim of relieving Masséna in the Siege of Genoa, who was threatened by severe food shortages resulting from the combination of encirclement on land and naval blockade by the British. \n\nGenoa fell before the First Consul could reach it. He concentrated his army and struck at the Austrians in an attempt to beat them before they too concentrated their forces again. The Reserve Army fought a battle at Montebello on 9 June before the main confrontation at Marengo. The consul was almost defeated here until General Desaix made a timely arrival with reinforcements and drove back Melas, thus turning a French rout into a French victory. In this counter-attack Desaix was killed, but Bonaparte later honoured him with monuments commemorating his bravery and his name has the place of honour on the face of the Arc de Triomphe, which was erected to celebrate Napoleon's victories.\n\nMarengo was the last major engagement on the Italian front during the Revolutionary Wars. Following it the massive Battle of Hohenlinden brought the Austrians to the negotiating table (singing the Armistice of Treviso) and the war ended shortly after.\n\n\n"}

It features many unconventional theatrical devices, such as overlapping dialogue, simultaneous scenes, and unsympathetic lead characters. The plot draws a parallel between the amoral and criminal activity that the characters engage in to provide escape from their boredom and suffering, and the two main characters' becoming a couple in order to escape from their lives. \n\nThe play takes its title from a quote in the Old Testament (Book of Jeremiah, chapter 46, verse 11).\n\nWilson wrote the play while living in New York City, finding inspiration by sitting in cafés and eavesdropping. He approached Marshall W. Mason, whom he knew from the Caffe Cino, to direct the production. After being workshopped in the directing and playwriting units of the Actors Studio, it debuted off-off-Broadway at La Mama Experimental Theater Club on January 20, 1965. It was a critical and commercial success, and was the first full-length play to be produced off-off-Broadway. Wilson said that he wrote the play partially because he wanted \"to break out of the physical limitations inherent in writing a play for the Cino\". It also became the first off-off-Broadway play to be published (by Hill and Wang). \n\nThe first Steppenwolf Theatre Company production ran from September 18 to October 16, 1980, and was directed by John Malkovich. A production co-produced by the Circle Repertory Company and Steppenwolf ran Off-Broadway from May 31, 1984 to January 6, 1985 at the Circle Repertory Theatre. Directed once again by Malkovich, the 1984 cast featured Jonathan Hogan, Danton Stone, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Sinise, Giancarlo Esposito, and Glenne Headly. Metcalf was praised for her performance as Darlene, particularly for her 20-minute monologue in the play's second act.\n\nIn 2005, the play was revived by the Barefoot Theatre Company at the Sargeant Theater in New York City under the direction of Eric Nightengale, who had assisted Malkovich in the 1984 revival. The 2005 revival starred Anna Chlumsky and Francisco Solorzano, and featured Victoria Malvagno, Luca Pierruci, Jennie West, John Gazzale, Trey Gibbons, Jeff Keilholtz, and Diego Kelman Ajuz.\n\nIn September 2011, the 2010 revival received six New York Innovative Theatre Awards nominations for off-off Broadway productions, including for Actress in a Lead Role (Jill Bianchini and Belle Caplis), Ensemble, Costume Design (Anne Wingate), and Sound Design (Andy Cohen). The production won the award for Outstanding Production of a Play.\n\n\"Balm in Gilead\" is set in Frank's café, a greasy spoon diner in New York City's Upper Broadway neighborhood, over the course of three days. The plot loosely centers on Joe, a cynical drug dealer, and Darlene, a naïve new arrival to the city. Joe and Darlene spend the night together hours after meeting, but he soon pushes her away, overwhelmed by his debt to a local kingpin named Chuckles. Meanwhile, Darlene finds herself ill-equipped to handle life in a slum, and she becomes increasingly vulnerable to the attentions of the various low-rent men who hang around the café looking for an easy target. \n\nJoe sees in Darlene a chance for a fresh start, and briefly considers giving up dealing. Just as he is about to return Chuckles' money, however, he is killed by one of the dealer's thugs. The play ends with all the lead characters droning their lines from the first scene over and over again in a circle, implying that their lives are stuck in a demoralizing rut.\n\n\n\n"}

NGC 147 is a member of the Local group of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It forms a physical pair with the nearby galaxy NGC 185,\nanother remote satellite of M31. It was discovered by John Herschel in September 1829. Visually it is both fainter and slightly larger than NGC 185 (and therefore has a considerably lower surface brightness). This means that NGC 147 is more difficult to see than NGC 185, which is visible in small telescopes. In the \"Webb Society Deep-Sky Observer's Handbook\", the visual appearance of NGC 147 is described as follows:\n\nLarge, quite faint, irregularly round; it brightens in the middle to a stellar nucleus.\nThe membership of NGC 147 in the Local Group was confirmed by Walter Baade in 1944 when he was able to resolve the galaxy into individual stars with the telescope at Mount Wilson near Los Angeles.\n\nA survey of the brightest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the area of radius 2′ from the center of NGC 147 shows that the last significant star-forming activity in NGC 147 occurred around 3 Gyr ago.\nNGC 147 contains a large population of older stars which show a spread in metallicity and age. The metallicity spread suggests that NGC 147 has had chemical enrichment. However, H I has not been observed and the interstellar medium (ISM) mass upper limit is much lower than expected had the material which is emitted from evolving stars been kept in the galaxy. This implies depletion of the ISM.\n\nAt least two techniques have been used to measure distances to NGC 147. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to NGC 147 using this technique is 2.67 ± 0.18 Mly (870 ± 60 kpc). However, NGC 147 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 147 using this technique is 2.21 ± 0.09 Mly (680 ± 30 kpc). Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 2.53 ± 0.11 Mly (780 ± 30 kpc).\n\n\n"}

McLaughlin sold the property to the state resulting in creation of the state park in 1963.\n\nAt the entrance to the park is a stone monument dedicated to Dr. James Daniel McLaughlin (1880-1953), a medical doctor who attended Atlanta College for Physicians and Surgeons and the medical extension program of the University of Alabama in Mobile.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2098980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098980", "title": "Vipassana movement", "text": "Vipassana movement\n\nThe Vipassanā movement, also called the Insight Meditation Movement and American vipassana movement, refers to a branch of modern Burmese Theravāda Buddhism which gained widespread popularity since the 1950s, and to its western derivatives which were popularised since the 1970s, helping give rise to the mindfulness movement.\n\nThe Burmese vipassana movement has its roots in the 19th century, when Theravada Buddhism came to be influenced by western modernism, and some monks tried to restore the Buddhist practice of meditation. Based on the commentaries, Ledi Sayadaw popularized \"vipassana meditation\" for lay people, teaching \"samatha\" and stressing the practice of \"satipatthana\" to acquire \"vipassana\" (insight) into the three marks of existence as the main means to attain the beginning of awakening and become a stream-enterer.\n\nIt was highly popularized in the 20th century in traditional Theravada countries by Mahasi Sayadaw, who introduced the \"New Burmese Satipatthana Method\". It also gained a large following in the west, due to westerners who learned \"vipassana\" from Mahasi Sayadaw, S. N. Goenka, and other Burmese teachers. Some also studied with Thai Buddhist teachers, who are more critical of the commentarial tradition, and stress the joined practice of \"samatha\" and \"vipassana\". \n\nThe 'American vipassanā movement' includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein, Tara Brach, Gil Fronsdal, Sharon Salzberg, Ruth Denison and Jack Kornfield. \n\nMost of these teachers combine the strict Burmese approach with the Thai approach, and also other Buddhist and non-Buddhist ideas and practices, due to their broader training and their critical approach of the Buddhist sources. And while the New Burmese Method is strictly based on the Theravada Abhidhamma and the \"Visuddhimagga\", western teachers tend to base their practice also on personal experience and on the suttas, which they approach in a more textual-critical way.\n\nIn a broader sense, modern western Theravada-oriented meditation also includes the teachings of Western-born monastics like Bhikkhu Bodhi, Bhikkhu Sujato, Bhikkhu Analayo, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu. They tend to take a more critical approach of the Buddhist suttas, some of them noting that the Theravada commentaries deviate from the suttas in critical ways.\n\nA recent development is the understanding that \"jhana\", as described in the nikayas, is not a form of concentration-meditation, but a training in heightened awareness and equanimity, which forms the culmination of the Buddhist path.\n\nAccording to Buswell, by the 10th century \"vipassana\" was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of \"Maitreya\". According to Braun, \"the majority of Theravadins and dedicated Buddhists of other traditions, including monks and nuns, have focused on cultivating moral behavior, preserving the Buddha’s teachings (dharma), and acquiring the good karma that comes from generous giving.\" Southern Esoteric Buddhist practices were widespread in the whole Theravadin world before being replaced by the Vipassana movement.\n\nThe interest in meditation was re-awakened in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816), who wrote \"vipassana\" manuals. The actual practice of meditation was re-invented in Theravada-countries in the 19th and 20th centuries and simplified meditation techniques, based on the \"Satipatthana sutta\", the \"Visuddhimagga\", and other texts, emphasizing \"satipatthana\" and bare insight were developed.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th century the Theravada traditions in Burma, Thailand and Sri Lanka were rejuvenated in response to western colonialism. They were rallying points in the struggle against western hegemonism, giving voice to traditional values and culture. But the Theravada-tradition was also reshaped, using the Pali scriptural materials to legitimize these reforms. Ironically, the Pali canon became widely accessible due to the western interest in those texts, and the publications of the Pali Text Society. A major role was also being played by the Theosophical Society, which sought for ancient wisdom in south-East Asia, and stimulated local interest in its own traditions. The Theosophical Society started a lay-Buddhist organisation in Sri Lanka, independent from power of conventional temples and monasteries. Interest in meditation was awakened by these developments, whereas the main Buddhist practice in temples was the recitation of texts, not of meditation practice. \n\nLay participation in Theravada countries grew strongly in the 20th century, and eventually also reached the west. Most influential in this renewed interest was the \"new Burmese method\" of Vipassana practice, as developed by U Nārada (1868–1955) and popularized by Mahasi Sayadaw (1904–1982). Ultimately, this practice aims at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in. This method spread over South and Southeast Asia, Europe and America, and has become synonymous with \"Vipassana\".\n\nA comparable development took place in Thailand, where the Buddhist orthodoxy was challenged by monks who aimed to reintroduce the practice of meditation, based on the Sutta Pitaka. In contrast to the Burmese vipassana teachers, Thai teachers taught \"vipassana\" in tandem with \"samatha\". The practical and doctrinal differences have been heatedly debated within south-east Asian Theravada Buddhism. They have also influenced western teachers, who have tended to take a more liberal approach, questioning the new orthodoxy and integrating various practices and doctrines.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Vipassana movement has given way to the largely secularized \"mindfulness\" practice, which has its roots in Zen and \"vipassana\"-meditation, and has eclipsed the popularity of vipassana meditation. In the latter approach, mindfulness, understood as \"the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally\", is the central practice, instead of \"vipassana\".\n\nThe vipassanā movement emphasizes the use of vipassanā to gain insight into the three marks of existence as the main means to attain wisdom and the beginning of awakening and become a stream-enterer, c.q. attain full liberation. The practices are based on the \"Satipatthana sutta\", the \"Visuddhimagga\", and other texts, emphasizing \"satipatthana\" and bare insight.\n\nThe various movements espouse forms of samatha and vipassanā meditation. The various vipassana teachers also make use of the scheme of the insight knowledges, stages of insight which every practitioner passes through in their progress of meditation. The foundation for this progress is the meditation on the arising and passing away of all contemplated phenomena (anicca), which leads to an understanding of their unsatisfactory (dukkha) nature and insight into not-self (anatta).\n\nContemporary Burmese Theravāda Buddhism is one of the main creators of modern vipassanā practice, which has gained popularity from the 1950s onward.\n\nLedi Sayadaw (1846–1923) prepared the ground for the popularisation of meditation by a lay audience, by re-introducing the practice of meditation, based on the Abhidhamma. \n\nS. N. Goenka (1924–2013) was a well-known Indian lay teacher in the Ledi-lineage who was taught by Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899–1971). According to S. N. Goenka, vipassanā techniques are essentially non-sectarian in character, and have universal application. One need not convert to Buddhism to practice these styles of meditation. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanā popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in Nepal, India, other parts of Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa. In the tradition of S.N.Goenka, vipassanā practice focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind. \nThe practice is usually taught in 10-day retreats, in which 3 days are given to the practice of anapanasati, intended to increase consistency and precision of attention, and the rest of the time is given to vipassanā in the form of \"body sweep\" practice in which the meditator moves through the body in sections, or as a whole, paying attention to the various sensations that arise without reacting to them. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, \"this form of meditation has by now become what probably is the most widely taught form of insight meditation world-wide.\" \n\nRuth Denison (1922–2015) was another senior teacher of the U Ba Khin method. Anagarika Munindra studied with both S.N. Goenka and Mahasi Sayadaw, and combined both lineages. Dipa Ma was a student of his.\n\nThe \"New Burmese method\" was developed by U Nārada (1868–1955) and popularized by his student, Mahasi Sayadaw (1904–1982). It was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1939, but became popular in the 1950s with the arrival of Burmese monks, where it gained great popularity among the laity, but was also severely criticised because of its disregard of \"samatta\". Most senior western vipassana teachers (Goldstein, Kornfield, Salzberg) studied with Mahasi Sayadaw and his student Sayadaw U Pandita. Nyanaponika Thera (1901–1994) ordained already in the fifties, contributing to the interest in \"vipassana\" with his publications. Prominent teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi is a student of Nyanaponika.\n\nAjahn Tong was a Thai master who studied for a short time under Mahasi Sayadaw before returning to found his own Vipassana lineage at Chom Tong in Thailand.\n\nThe \"New Burmese Method\" emphasizes the attainment of \"vipassana\", insight, by practising \"satipatthana\", paying close attention to the ongoing changes in body and mind. Gil Fronsdal: \nNyanaponika Thera coined the term \"bare attention\" for the mindfulness practice of the \"new Burmese Method.\" Yet, Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of \"correct view\", not just \"bare attention\":\n\nMogok Sayadaw (1899-1962) taught the importance of the awareness of noticing the 'arising' and 'Passing away' of all experience as the way to gain insight into impermanence. Mogok Sayadaw emphasized the importance of right understanding and that a meditator should learn the theory of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada) when practicing vipassana. The Mogok vipassana Method focuses on meditation of Feeling (Vedanannupassana) and meditation on Mind states (Cittanupassana).\n\nThe method of Pa Auk Sayadaw is closely based on the Visuddhimagga, a classic Theravada meditation manual. Pa Auk promotes the extensive development of the four jhanas, states of meditative absorption and focus. The insight element is based on surveying the body by observing the four elements (earth, water, fire and wind) by using the sensations of hardness, heaviness, warmth and motion. Western teachers who work with this method include Shaila Catherine, Stephen Snyder and Tina Rasmussen.\n\nComparable developments took place within Thai Theravada Buddhism, yet with somewhat different textual, doctrinal and practical stances. Mun Bhuridatta, the founder of the Thai Forest tradition, also sought to re-introduce the practice of meditation. \n\nWhile not a lay movement, the Thai Forest Tradition has been influential in the development of the lay meditation movements. This is a tradition of Buddhist monasticism within Thai Theravāda Buddhism which was in part a reaction against this perceived dilution in Buddhism. Practitioners inhabit remote wilderness and forest dwellings as spiritual practice training grounds. It is widely known among Thai people for its orthodoxy, conservatism, and strict adherence to monastic rules (\"vinaya\").\n\nPerhaps its most widely known representative was Ajahn Chah; Jack Kornfield, one of the main western teachers of Insight meditation, trained as a monk under Ajahn Chah. Ajahn Sumedho is the senior Western representative of the Thai forest tradition, he was the abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery (1984–2010). A well-known American monk in this tradition is Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu, abbot of Metta Forest Monastery in San Diego County. Western representatives of the Thai forest tradition are known to teach lay practitioners at the monasteries and to visit lay meditation centers to teach.\n\nAnother influential scholar-monk was Buddhadasa, who gave his own original interpretation of key teachings, rejecting the classical rebirth-doctrine, and emphasizing liberation from \"dukkha\" in this life.\n\nSince the early 1980s, insight meditation has gained a growing popularity in the western world, and saw a synthesis of various practices and backgrounds, with the growing insight in its roots and doctrinal background, and the introduction of other modern traditions. A major developments is the popularisation of mindfulness as a technique of its own.\n\nJack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein taught a series of classes at Naropa University in 1974, and began teaching a series of retreats together for the next two years. The retreats were modeled on 10- and 30-day Goenka retreats, but the technique taught was mainly based on Mahasi Sayadaw's practice (with the inclusion of Metta meditation). In 1976 Kornfield and Goldstein, along with Sharon Salzberg and Jacqueline Schwartz founded the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, followed by its sister center, Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin County, California. \n\nKornfield, and related teachers, tend to de-emphasize the religious elements of Buddhism such as \"rituals, chanting, devotional and merit-making activities, and doctrinal studies\" and focus on meditative practice. According to Jack Kornfield, \nSome teachers adhere to a strict 'Burmese approach', in which meditation is equated with \"kasina\" (concentration) meditation, and vipassana is the main aim. Others, like Bhikkhu Thannissaro, who trained in Thailand, criticise the Burmese orthodoxy, and propagate an integrative approach, in which samatha and vipassana are developed in tandem. Kornfield, who trained in both Burma and Thailand, also propagates an integrative approach.\n\nA main criticism of the Burmese method is its reliance on the commentatorial literature, in which vipassana is separated from samatha, and \"jhana\" is equated with concentration meditation.Thanissaro Bhikkhu stresses the fact that the kasina method is marginally treated in the suttas, in which the emphasis is predominantly on \"jhana\". In the suttas, \"samatha\" and \"vipassana\" are qualities of the mind which are developed together. This point is also reiterated by Shankman, arguing that samatha and vipassana cannot be separated. \n\nGroundbreaking research on early Buddhist meditation has been conducted by Bronkhorst, Vetter, Gethin, Gombrich, and Wynne arguing that \"jhana\" may have been the core practice of early Buddhism, and noting that this practice was not a form of concentration-meditation, but a cumulative practice resulting in mindful awareness of objects while being indifferent to it. Polak, elaborating on Vetter, notes that the onset of the first \"dhyana\" is described as a quite natural process, due to the preceding efforts to restrain the senses and the nurturing of wholesome states. Recently Keren Arbel, elaborating on Bronkhorst, vetter and Gethin, has argued that mindfulness, jhana, samatha and vipassana form an integrated whole, leading to an alert, joyful and compassionate state of mind and being. Polak and Arbel, following Gethin, further note that there is a \"definite affinity\" between the four \"jhanas\" and the \"bojjhaṅgā\", the seven factors of awakening.\n\nThe \"bare attention\" propagated in the New Burmese Method has been popularized as mindfulness, starting with Jon Kabat Zinn's MBSR, developed in the late 1970s.\npa-auk method is mindfulness of breathing based on sutan and visuddhimagga.\n\nWomen have been quite prominent as teachers in the vipassanā movement. Though the formal Theravāda vipassanā tradition has been maintained by an almost exclusively male monastic tradition, nuns and non-monastic female adepts have played important roles, despite being completely absent or only noted in the background of the historical record. These teachers and practitioners expand the framework of vipassanā to incorporate the immanence of the female body and its innate opportunities for enlightenment through the cycles of its physiology and the emotions of marriage, childlessness, childbearing, child loss, and widowhood.\n\nThe modern Bangladeshi teacher Dipa Ma, a student of Anagarika Munindra, was one of the first female Asian masters to be invited to teach in America. As a widowed, single mother, Dipa Ma was a householder (non-monastic) who exemplified liberation and taught vipassanā as not only a retreat practice but also a lifestyle. Her message to women and men was you don't have to leave your family to reach high states of spiritual understanding, and she taught a radical inclusiveness. She encouraged women who were mothers of young children to practice vipassanā through the daily activities of mothering. She once said to Joseph Goldstein that \"Women have an advantage over men because they have more supple minds... It may be difficult for men to understand this, because they are men.\" When asked if there was any hope for men, she replied \"The Buddha was a man, and Jesus was a man. So there is hope for you.\"\n\nDipa Ma's mettā (loving-kindness) meditation instruction was a core component to be practiced after each vipassanā session. It involves five stages, the first of which was the mastery of self-compassion in mind and heart, then continuing to the other stages. The prayer of the first stage, given in English is as follows:\n\nIndian teacher Ilaichidevi Goenka, was a wife of the Burmese-trained S. N. Goenka and mother of six children, began practicing adhittan vipassanā when her youngest child was four years old, eventually joining her husband on the teaching platform as co-teacher to thousands of students at retreat centers and prisons all over India as well as internationally. Prisoners who do vipassanā meditation reportedly experience less behavior problems while incarcerated and have lower rates of recidivism. \"Mataji\", as she is lovingly referred to by her students, also used to lead chants with her husband.\n\nIndian Shambhavi Chopra, a former textiles designer and divorced mother of two who is now co-director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies, writes of her 10-day vipassanā meditation training at a retreat center in Germany in her book \"Yogini: The Enlightened Woman\", and encourages students to explore vipassanā practice and mastery as a devotion to the Divine Mother of all.\n\nVipassanā movement traditions have offered meditation programs in some prisons. One notable example was in 1993 when Kiran Bedi, a reformist Inspector General of India's prisons, learned of the success of vipassanā in a jail in Jaipur, Rajasthan. A ten-day retreat involved officials and inmates alike was then tried in India's largest prison Tihar Jail near New Delhi. Vipassana is being taught in Jail 4 of Tihar Prisons to inmates in two ten day courses every month around the year since 1994 onwards. This program was said to have dramatically changed the behavior of inmates and jailers alike. Inmates who completed the ten-day course were less violent and had a lower recidivism rate than other inmates. This project was documented in the documentary film, \"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana\". Vipassana prison courses are routinely offered at the Donaldson Prison Facility in Alabama through the Vipassana Prison Trust.\n\nThai Forest Tradition\n\nBurma\n\n\nThailand\n\nBurma/Burmese tradition\n\nWestern teachers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first masked hero to appear in American comic books.\n\nCreated by cartoonist George Brenner, the Clock first appeared in the Comics Magazine Company publication \"Funny Picture Stories\" #1 (Nov 1936). According to \"Secondary Superheroes of Golden Age Comics\": \n\nA hypnotist with a secret underground lair, his minimalist costume as a master of disguise was a three-piece suit and mask. The Clock used a number of gadgets (including a cane whose head becomes a projectile, and a diamond stud which fires tear gas), and customarily left a calling card with a clock face and \"The Clock Has Struck\". The Clock's secret identity was eventually disclosed as Brian O'Brien, a wealthy member of high society.\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"The criminals he fights are usually ordinary gangsters and Nazis, but there is also the occasional mad scientist and superhuman (like the massive, bullet-proof idiot Stuporman).\"\nThe character appeared in \"Funny Pages\" #6–11 and other titles from the Comics Magazine Company, including \"Detective Picture Stories\" and \"Keen Detective Funnies\". In 1937 the company was bought by Ultem Publications, which encountered financial difficulties and sold the Clock (and other characters) to Quality Comics. Ultem was purchased and renamed Centaur Publications; despite the sale to Quality, Centaur continued to reprint old Clock stories.\n\nThe Clock continued to be written and drawn in new stories by Brenner in \"Feature Funnies\" (later retitled \"Feature Comics\") from #3 (December 1937) through #31 (April 1940), and was featured on the cover of issues #25, #28 and #29. The Clock feature was moved to \"Crack Comics\" #1 (May 1940).\n\nWhen Centaur sold the Clock to Quality, he acquired a sidekick. He was first assisted by Pat \"Pug\" Brady, a former boxer who looked exactly like Brian O'Brien; they met when picking each other's pockets in \"Crack Comics\" #1. Pug's disguise was even more minimal; consisting of a handkerchief worn like a bandanna. In his first story with the Clock, Pug discovered his secret identity and killed another character who made the same discovery.\n\nIn \"Crack Comics\" #21 Pug disappeared without explanation as the Clock, shot, crawled into a basement to die. A young girl, Butch Buchanan, was squatting in the basement and nursed him back to health. She became his \"moll\", and from issue #22 his costume was similar to that of the Spirit. The Clock alternated appearances on the cover of \"Crack Comics\" with the Black Condor until #19, continuing as a backup feature of that title until his final appearance in \"Crack Comics\" #35 (Autumn 1944).\n\nAfter Quality Comics ceased operations in 1956, DC Comics acquired the rights to its characters. It did not renew the copyright for most of its characters (including the Clock), allowing them to fall into the public domain, and has not used the Clock apart from a few mentions. In the DC Universe, the Clock was initially said to have been killed in 1944 (the year of his final appearance). In \"Starman\" Vol. 2 #19 the Shade wrote in his journal, \"Brian O'Brien told me the reports of his death were greatly exaggerated\". In \"Starman\" #20 O'Brien was said to be active in Chicago, despite several Golden Age references to his home city as a seaport.\n\nIn 1992, Malibu Comics published 20 issues of \"The Protectors\", starring a superhero team including several characters from the Centaur line. In this universe, Brian O'Brien was the first costumed hero. With the advent of super-powered heroes, he gave up crimefighting and joined the army. O'Brien rose through the ranks, eventually becoming President of the United States.\n\nIn 2013, Dynamite Entertainment published an eight-issue miniseries, \"Masks\", with several pulp and comic-book characters fighting the Justice Party (which has taken over New York State). In issue #7, Brian O'Brien is revealed as the shadowy figure behind the Party.\n\n"}

It is a cell-surface receptor that recognizes the apoprotein B100, which is embedded in the outer phospholipid layer of LDL particles. The receptor also recognizes the apoE protein found in chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDL). In humans, the LDL receptor protein is encoded by the \"LDLR\" gene on chromosome 19. It belongs to the Low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. It is most significantly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells and adrenal gland and cortex tissue.\n\nMichael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein were awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their identification of LDL-R and its relation to cholesterol metabolism and familial hypercholesterolemia. The \"LDLR\" gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nThe \"LDLR\" gene resides on chromosome 19 at the band 19p13.2 and is split into 18 exons. Exon 1 contains a signal sequence that localises the receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum for transport to the cell surface. Beyond this, exons 2-6 code the ligand binding region; 7-14 code the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain; 15 codes the oligosaccharide rich region; 16 (and some of 17) code the membrane spanning region; and 18 (with the rest of 17) code the cytosolic domain.\n\nThis gene produces 6 isoforms through alternative splicing.\n\nThis protein belongs to the LDLR family and is made up of a number of functionally distinct domains, including 3 EGF-like domains, 7 LDL-R class A domains, and 6 LDL-R class B repeats.\n\nThe N-terminal domain of the LDL receptor, which is responsible for ligand binding, is composed of seven sequence repeats (~50% identical). Each repeat, referred to as a class A repeat or LDL-A, contains roughly 40 amino acids, including 6 cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds within the repeat. Additionally, each repeat has highly conserved acidic residues which it uses to coordinate a single calcium ion in an octahedral lattice. Both the disulfide bonds and calcium coordination are necessary for the structural integrity of the domain during the receptor's repeated trips to the highly acidic interior of the endosome. The exact mechanism of interaction between the class A repeats and ligand (LDL) is unknown, but it is thought that the repeats act as \"grabbers\" to hold the LDL. Binding of ApoB requires repeats 2-7 while binding ApoE requires only repeat 5 (thought to be the ancestral repeat).\n\nNext to the ligand binding domain is an EGF precursor homology domain (EGFP domain). This shows approximately 30% homology with the EGF precursor gene. There are three \"growth factor\" repeats; A, B and C. A and B are closely linked while C is separated by the YWTD repeat region, which adopts a beta-propeller conformation (LDL-R class B domain). It is thought that this region is responsible for the pH-dependent conformational shift that causes bound LDL to be released in the endosome.\n\nA third domain of the protein is rich in O-linked oligosaccharides but appears to show little function. Knockout experiments have confirmed that no significant loss of activity occurs without this domain. It has been speculated that the domain may have ancestrally acted as a spacer to push the receptor beyond the extracellular matrix.\n\nThe single transmembrane domain of 22 (mostly) non-polar residues crosses the plasma membrane in a single alpha helix.\n\nThe cytosolic C-terminal domain contains ~50 amino acids, including a signal sequence important for localizing the receptors to clathrin-coated pits and for triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding. Portions of the cytosolic sequence have been found in other lipoprotein receptors, as well as in more distant receptor relatives.\n\nMutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor are known to cause familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThere are 5 broad classes of mutation of the LDL receptor:\n\n\nLDL receptor mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL and thus maintains the plasma level of LDL. This occurs in all nucleated cells, but mainly in the liver which removes ~70% of LDL from the circulation. LDL receptors are clustered in clathrin-coated pits, and coated pits pinch off from the surface to form coated endocytic vesicles that carry LDL into the cell. After internalization, the receptors dissociate from their ligands when they are exposed to lower pH in endosomes. After dissociation, the receptor folds back on itself to obtain a closed conformation and recycles to the cell surface. The rapid recycling of LDL receptors provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of cholesterol to cells. It was also reported that by association with lipoprotein in the blood, viruses such as hepatitis C virus, Flaviviridae viruses and bovine viral diarrheal virus could enter cells indirectly via LDLR-mediated endocytosis. LDLR has been identified as the primary mode of entry for the Vesicular stomatitis virus in mice and humans. In addition, LDLR modulation is associated with early atherosclerosis-related lymphatic dysfunction. Synthesis of receptors in the cell is regulated by the level of free intracellular cholesterol; if it is in excess for the needs of the cell then the transcription of the receptor gene will be inhibited. LDL receptors are translated by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum and are modified by the Golgi apparatus before travelling in vesicles to the cell surface.\n\nIn humans, LDL is directly involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the process responsible for the majority of cardiovascular diseases, due to accumulation of LDL-cholesterol in the blood . Hyperthyroidism may be associated with hypocholesterolemia via upregulation of the LDL receptor, and hypothyroidism with the converse. A vast number of studies have described the relevance of LDL receptors in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and steatohepatitis. Previously, rare mutations in LDL-genes have been shown to contribute to myocardial infarction risk in individual families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with myocardial infarction risk in the population. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-III. Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk. Overall, LDLR has a high clinical relevance in blood lipids.\n\nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the LDLR gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmö Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).\n\n"}

A part of the Fremont Street Experience, it is the oldest and smallest hotel (106 rooms) on the Fremont Street Experience.\n\nJohn F. Miller initially opened a temporary tent hotel – the Miller Hotel – on the property in 1905, while he planned to construct a permanent hotel structure, which opened as the Hotel Nevada on January 13, 1906. A casino operated within the hotel until a statewide gambling ban took effect in 1909. In 1931, the property was expanded and renamed as Sal Sagev (\"Las Vegas\" spelled backwards). The casino reopened that year when gambling in Nevada was legalized again. In 1955, the casino was renamed as the Golden Gate. The entire property was renamed as the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino in 1974. The Golden Gate was known for its cheap shrimp cocktails, served from 1959 to 2017.\n\nJohn F. Miller was among the first to come to Las Vegas in 1905. An auction for property in the city's future downtown area was held in May 1905. Miller purchased a $1,750 parcel at the southeast corner of Main Street and Fremont Street. On the property shortly thereafter, he established the Miller Hotel, a temporary tent hotel that was also known as the Hotel Nevada.\n\nIn August 1905, Miller had plans to construct a permanent two-story hotel structure on the property. Construction on the new hotel was to begin as soon as the Kuhn Mercantile Company could vacate the property. In September 1905, the Miller Hotel became the first lodging establishment in Las Vegas to receive plumbing. In December 1905, plans were underway for a two-story retail and apartment building, to be constructed adjacent to the Hotel Nevada. The front of the new building was to be cemented to blend in with the hotel. Miller planned for the hotel to be modern, with amenities that included heating, electricity, and a telephone system.\n\nThe two-story Hotel Nevada, located at 1 Fremont Street, opened on January 13, 1906, becoming the first hotel structure in Las Vegas, and the only concrete hotel in southern Nevada. The hotel rooms measured 10 feet square, cost $1 per day, and were referred to by a local newspaper as \"first class\". Due to the hotel's popularity, Miller announced in June 1906 that he would soon have a third story added to the property, expected to be finished by September 1, 1906. In October 1906, construction was underway on the addition, which consisted of brick and measured 20 feet by 30 feet. The addition added a kitchen and four bedrooms. In 1907, Las Vegas' first telephone was installed at the Hotel Nevada, with the number 1.\n\nThe hotel's casino operated until 1909, when gambling was banned in Nevada. The casino's blackjack and poker tables were subsequently put into storage. By March 1918, Miller was considering a large addition to the hotel that would consist of reinforced concrete and would include 40 feet of frontage along Fremont Street. The hotel gained additional popularity beginning in 1925, when city officials had Fremont Street paved. The Hotel Nevada reopened its casino in 1931, when gambling in Nevada was legalized again. That year, the property was expanded to four stories and renamed as the Sal Sagev (Las Vegas spelled backwards).\n\nIn July 1955, Abe Miller – the property's longtime operator and the son of John F. Miller – was approved for plans to lease the Sal Sagev's ground floor to a 23-man group, which would sublease the floor for $25,000 per month to eight Italian-American men, nearly all of them from Oakland, California. The eight men planned to open the Golden Gate casino on the ground floor of the Sal Sagev. Renovations on the new casino were underway that month and were being financed by the 23-man group, with an estimated cost of $330,000. Abe Miller was to receive $2,300 per month, as well as five percent of the gambling profits. The Golden Gate casino, named after the Golden Gate Bridge, opened on the ground floor later in 1955, while the hotel retained the Sal Sagev name. Italo Ghelfi, one of the eight partners, operated the casino for nearly 40 years.\n\nIn February 1957, John F. Miller died during a nap at his apartment, located within the Sal Sagev hotel. He was 92 years old, and had experienced a substantial period of declining health. Abe Miller continued to operate the Sal Sagev into the 1960s. In 1964, the hotel was expanded to include a total of 106 rooms. In 1965, the hotel's exterior was covered in aluminum siding, which remained until its removal in 1990. As of 1969, Abe Miller operated the property with his sister, Helen Nugent.\n\nIn 1974, the entire property was renamed as the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino. Abe Miller and his sister had died by 1985, and his sister willed her small ownership of the property to nuns at The Convent of the Good Shepherd of Las Vegas. Ghelfi's family purchased the property from the partnership in 1990, and removed the metal-screen façade that had earlier been applied to the structure. The Golden Gate's 90th anniversary was marked by numerous celebrations in late May 1996, including Las Vegas mayor Jan Laverty Jones proclaiming it to be \"Las Vegas' Most Historic Hotel.\"\nThe 106-room, four-story hotel was renovated in 2005. By that time, the property was managed by Mark Brandenburg, Ghelfi's son. Brandenburg later became the owner. In March 2008, Brandenberg sold a 50% interest in the property to Desert Rock Enterprises, the investment company of Derek and Greg Stevens, who also owned the Las Vegas 51s baseball team and a 19% stake in the Riviera casino. With new money infused by the Stevens, the Golden Gate undertook casino upgrades and hotel room renovations. The following year, the Stevens raised their stake to 60%, and Derek took over as CEO, with Brandenburg as president. \n\nIn 2010, a Du-par's restaurant opened inside the Golden Gate, replacing the Bay City Diner. Du-par's operated as a leased tenant of the Golden Gate.\n\nIn 2012, the Golden Gate began its first major renovation in more than 50 years, gutting the old piano bar area and vintage hotel lobby area in favor of a more open and modern look, including scantily-clad women at the betting tables known as dancing dealers. The $12 million renovation includes a 35,000-square-foot, five-story hotel tower with 14 new suites and two penthouses, a new porte cochere, a new check-in and slot club desks, an expansion of the casino floor and a new high limit gaming area. Greg and Derek Stevens became full owners of Golden Gate in 2016.\n\nOn February 7, 2017, the Du-par's restaurant closed due to financial reasons, as it had been struggling with lease payments. It was owned by Biff Naylor, son of one of Golden Gate's original owners, Tiny Naylor.\n\nThat month, construction began on an expansion to the Golden Gate's casino. The expansion would take Golden Gate's footprint into the space formerly occupied by the La Bayou casino. The Golden Gate closed around 2:00 a.m. on August 21, 2017, to allow for the multimillion-dollar renovation project, which had been planned for eight months. The project doubled the casino size and added 100 new slot machines. The project also added a new casino entrance, and extended the outdoor OneBar by 20 feet. The renovations occurred at the site of the former La Bayou as well as an alley that once separated the two casinos. The Golden Gate reopened 106 hours later, at 12:00 p.m. on August 25, 2017. The casino contains of space.\n\nThe Golden Gate was the first to serve a fifty cent shrimp cocktail in 1959, now a Las Vegas cliché. The idea came from owner Italo Ghelfi, who based it on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.\n\nThe Original Shrimp Cocktail consists of a regular-sized sundae glass filled with small salad shrimp and topped with a dollop of cocktail sauce. In 1991, the price was raised from 50¢ to 99¢, as the property was losing $300,000 a year on shrimp cocktails under the previous price. The price was raised in 2008 to $1.99. Until the 2012 renovations, there was a deli bar from which the shrimp cocktails were served. \n\nOn April 26, 2008, the price on the famous shrimp cocktail rose to $1.99, due to a rise in fuel costs; it was the first increase in 17 years. Prior to the price increase, the casino lost about $300,000 a year on shrimp cocktails. As of October 26, 2012, the price stood at $2.99. As of August 2013, the price was $3.99.\n\nWith the closure of the privately owned Du-par's restaurant, Golden Gate discontinued serving its shrimp cocktail. Derek Stevens, co-owner of Golden Gate, stated that the shrimp cocktail recipe is owned by the casino, and that it would return with the next restaurant concept to open at the hotel.\n"}

On 14 May 2006 he succeeded Matthias Platzeck as chairman of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). He resigned from that post on 7 September 2008.\n\nOn 28 September 2012 he announced his resignation from the post of minister-president. He was succeeded by social minister Malu Dreyer.\n\nFollowing Peter Struck's death in 2012, Kurt Beck together with Dieter Schulte took chair of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.\n\nBeck was born in Bad Bergzabern, Rhineland-Palatinate, to the bricklayer Oskar Beck and his wife Johanna. Both his parents had their roots in the town Kapsweyer in southern Rhenish Palatinate. He grew up in Steinfeld.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1968, he became an electrician. After military duty in 1968 and 1969, he graduated from an evening school in 1972. Since then, he served as an employee representative on works councils.\n\nAfter joining the SPD in 1972, mainly because of the Party's programme as well as the personality of Willy Brandt, Beck became chairman of the SPD of Rhineland Palatinate in 1993 and deputy chairman of the federal party in 2003. He served in this function until 14 May 2006.\n\nBeck has been active in local affairs since 1974, when he was first elected a member of the Kreistag. From 1989 to 1994, he was mayor of his hometown Steinfeld. From 1979, he was a directly elected member of the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate, in which he served as the speaker for social affairs of the Parliamentary group of the SPD (from 1982 to 1985) and as a member of the governing body of the group from 1985 to 1991, when he was elected chairman.\n\nOn 26 October 1994 Kurt Beck was elected Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate, succeeding Rudolf Scharping. He was re-elected three times, in 1996, 2001 and 2006. As Minister President he was known for his centrist approach, which is also apparent from the choice of his coalition partner (the liberal FDP instead of the left-wing Green Party, with which the SPD has recently allied itself). In this respect, he follows the policy of Scharping. In March 2006, Beck's SPD gained an absolute majority in the state elections; Beck offered to continue the coalition but since the FDP declined, the SPD formed a government without a partner. After Edmund Stoiber resigned in 2007, Beck was the senior Minister President in Germany.\n\nDuring his time in office, Beck's decisions in Rhineland-Palatinate to increase efficiency in the state government via administrative reorganisation, and to introduce full-day schooling and free kindergartens, drew national attention. The state also emerged as one of the country’s top economic performers. When the United States Armed Forces closed dozens of camps and barracks with the loss of 100,000 jobs, Beck's government invested heavily in retraining schemes, creating 40,000 new jobs.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Beck was President of the Bundesrat, one of his duties as Minister President.\n\nIn September 2012, Beck announced his resignation. He had been under pressure for weeks over the bankruptcy of the Nürburgring motorsports complex in Rhineland-Palatinate, one of the world's most famous race tracks.\n\nWhen Matthias Platzeck had to resign for medical reasons in 2006, Beck was officially elected as chairman of the SPD with the approval of 95% of the delegates. He became the party’s fourth chairman in seven years.\n\nBeck decided not to join the cabinet and succeed Vice-Chancellor Franz Müntefering because it would have prevented him from criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government. According to public opinion polls during his time as party chairman, his possibilities of becoming Chancellor, if he had run for this office in the 2009 election, had been very limited. According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, only 16% of Germans would have elected him in the hypothetical case of a direct vote against Angela Merkel.\n\nDuring his time in office as party leader, Beck most notably negotiated an agreement with Merkel’s Christian Democrats in April 2017 on a partial privatization of national railway Deutsche Bahn's passenger and freight divisions. Meanwhile, Beck's decision in early 2008 to allow regional cooperation with the left-wing populist Left Party in western German state parliaments caused a rift within his party and triggered a slump in opinion poll ratings for the SPD and him personally.\n\nOn 7 September 2008, Beck resigned as chairman at a party meeting in Werder, Brandenburg and Frank-Walter Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for Chancellor in the 2009 election, while Franz Müntefering replaced Beck as chairman after an interim of Steinmeier. At the time, he said that he was a victim of intrigue inside the SPD.\n\nIn March 2017, Beck was appointed the government's official commissioner for the victims of the attack at the Christmas market at Berlin's Breitscheidplatz on December 19, 2016. Later that year, together with German Justice Minister Heiko Maas, he presented his final report.\n\nNear the end of 2006, Beck recommended to Henrico Frank, an unemployed construction worker from Wiesbaden, to wash himself and shave so he could get a job. Following a media controversy about Beck's behaviour, Frank declined all jobs offered to him by the state chamber. Later, he was hired as a punk rock expert for iMusic TV.\n\nIn April 2007, Beck proposed a peace conference in Afghanistan with the inclusion of \"moderate Taliban\". The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, thus accused him of being naïve. He compared the idea of \"moderate Taliban\" to distinguishing between moderate and radical right-wing extremists in Rhineland-Palatinate. The German public mostly ignored the affair.\n\n\n\nBeck is Catholic. He lives with his wife, Roswitha, whom he married in 1968 in Steinfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate. They have one son (Stefan Beck).\n\n"}

It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H-receptors.\nLevocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 4.50 £ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$3. In 2017, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.\n\nLevocetirizine is used for allergic rhinitis. This includes allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching.\n\nLevocetirizine is called a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts, and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. Cardiac safety with repolarization may be better than some other antihistamines, as levocetirizine does not significantly prolong the QT interval in healthy individuals. However, some people may still experience some slight sleepiness, headache, mouth dryness, lightheadedness, vision problems (mainly blurred vision), palpitations and fatigue.\n\nLevocetirizine is an antihistamine. It acts as an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increase the blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever.\n\nChemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the \"l\"-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines.\n\nLevocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB.\n\nOn 31 January 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter version. Although the drug was authorized by the FDA in 2007, it was already available in most European countries. Like many new drugs it entered the market at a higher price than currently available third and second generation antihistamines. In India, one form of the drug is available as Crohist MK tablets and syrup, a formulation of levocetirizine hydrochloride and montelukast. In India, Crohist MK is a Schedule 'H' drug and may only be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner.\n\nLevocetirizine is sold under the following brand names:\n"}

After transferring across the lunar samples and other equipment, \"Falcon\" was jettisoned. It would fire its rocket engine to cause it to impact the lunar surface.\n\nApollo 15 spent one more day in lunar orbit, continuing Worden's observations. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their service propulsion system to put them on a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay cameras.\n\nThe twelfth day in space was uneventful, with Mission Control holding a press conference where the astronauts were asked questions submitted by the news media. On their 13th and final day they prepared for reentry. During descent one of their three parachutes failed, and they splashed down successfully with only two.\n\n\"Falcon\" lifted off from the lunar surface at 171 hours, 37 minutes and 16 seconds GET. During ascent from the Moon, Worden played \"The Air Force Song\". Although he thought it was only being played for Houston, unbeknownst to him, a switch had been flicked in Mission Control that relayed his voice transmissions to the LM. It is understood that Scott was not very happy with this, as it was impossible to make out any communications from Mission Control while the song played.\n\nThe LM was placed into a 42 by 9 nm (77.8 by 16.7 km) orbit. Apollo 15 would be the first direct rendezvous, where the two craft would rendezvous within one orbit. The LM orbit was not perfectly in the same plane as the CSM's, so another burn of the LM's ascent engine was required.\n\nDuring the following near side pass, the spacecraft continued to close, with \"Falcon\", in its lower orbit, catching \"Endeavour\". Once about 120 feet (40 m) apart the spacecraft started to station-keep — keeping the distance between them constant. As on all Apollo flights, the crew extensively photographed and filmed this process. \"Endeavour\" closed in to hard dock and the mission of \"Falcon\" had come to an end.\n\nAfter opening the hatches, the crew began the task of transferring the rock samples that had been collected on the surface. Scott and Irwin also vacuumed their spacesuits to try to rid them of as much dust as possible. Also transferred were film magazines, food, used urine and fecal bags (they were included for medical investigators). One Oxygen Purge System (OPS) was also transferred. On the lunar surface the OPS would be used as an emergency oxygen supply, or by the crew of the LM in the event that they were unable to achieve hard docking with the CSM and had to undertake an EVA to transfer across from the LM. Worden would use it during his EVA later in the mission.\n\nFollowing the completion of the transfer, the crew resealed the hatches between the two craft and prepared to jettison the LM. This was different from the undocking that took place before landing. In this case it would be an explosive jettison as much of the docking probe structure was now unneeded and will stay in the LM. There was some difficulty in getting the tunnel between the craft to depressurize. This suggested that there was an improperly sealed hatch, delaying the separation by one orbit. After checking the hatches the crew could not find a cause for the improper seal, but the tunnel now vented successfully. In his 2001 memoir, Flight Director Christopher Kraft wrote that some of these difficulties may have been the result of crew fatigue. Because of the longer lunar stay time, by this point Scott and Irwin had gone an arduous 22 hours without sleep, and both men had experienced some heart irregularities on the lunar surface after their EVAs. Kraft wrote that coordination between ground controllers and the crew broke down several times at this point in the mission, and he recalled this as one of the most stressful experiences during his career in mission control.\n\nA change in crew procedure had come after the deaths of three crewmembers of Soyuz 11 less than a month before the launch of Apollo 15. On Soyuz 11 the crew had been killed after a repressurization valve opened during the separation of the orbital and service modules from the reentry module of the Soyuz spacecraft. Mission planners for Apollo 15 decided that the crew should now wear their pressure suits during the separation of the LM from the CSM, something that had not previously occurred. The suits caused some problems for 15 as during an integrity test before the tunnel venting they were unable to achieve suit integrity in Scott's suit.\n\nAfter finally jettisoning the LM, the CSM performed a small RCS burn to further separate from the LM. \"Falcon\" was directed to burn its ascent stage engine, so that it would impact the lunar surface. The delay has meant it would not impact in the planned site, instead impacting at 26°12' N, 0°6' E, about 56 miles (90 km) from the landing site.\n\nThe crew should have started their sleep period, but due to the delays now had to finish housekeeping chores. Mainly these centered around turning back on the SIM instruments which had been turned off during the rendezvous and docking and orientating the spacecraft for their proper use. Just before the sleep period, Deke Slayton, who was effectively the astronauts' boss, radioed the crew and told them to take a Seconal sedative. The crew decided against this.\n\nDoctors on the ground had become worried when they saw that Scott's and Irwin's EKG had developed a bigeminy rhythm. Caused by a lack of potassium, the ventricles beat in couplets, instead of a single constant beat. The potassium deficiency is thought to have been caused by the training schedule and stress of the flight. Irwin would later die in 1991 of a heart attack.\n\nFinally 3½ hours after they were meant to go to sleep and 2 hours after Mission Control first said good night to the crew, they started their sleep period on the 54th orbit of the Moon. Scott and Irwin had been awake over 23 hours and Worden 21 hours.\n\nApollo 15 spent one final day in lunar orbit before trans-Earth injection (TEI), the SPS burn that would put them on a trajectory back to Earth. This day was spent mainly on the same tasks that had occupied Worden during the past four days.\n\nMission Control decided to make many changes to the flight plan. The Laser Altimeter failed and was declared a lost cause. The crew were asked to use a 250 mm telephoto lens instead of an 80 mm lens on the Hasselblad. They were also instructed to take as many photographs as they liked. There was no point in them returning to Earth carrying unexposed film.\n\nAmong their photographic targets were the terminator region, where the Sun would appear to be either rising or setting for an observer on the ground. These photographs were extremely useful as they showed surface features in strong relief. Now, with three persons on board, the crew were able to acquire many more handheld photographs, with one person always available to run the SIM and receive flight plan updates from Mission Control. The crew were also instructed to just turn on the Panoramic Camera and let it run now that all its primary targets had been imaged.\n\nAs Apollo 15 appeared from behind the Moon on its 73rd orbit, there were only two more orbits left before TEI. During this time the crew had to release the subsatellite and prepare for the rocket burn that would send them home. Like all parts of the CSM and LM, the SPS was highly redundant. The only parts that were not were the engine bell and the combustion chamber.\n\nThe subsatellite was designed to measure the gravitational field of the Moon and investigate the Earth and Moon's magnetospheres. It was 31 inches (79 cm) long, with a 14-inch (36 cm) hexagonal body. Weighing a total of 78.5 pounds (35.6 kg), it was powered by solar cells for daytime operations and a silver-cadmium battery for the nighttime. It had three booms that extended after release, which were 5 ft (1.5 m) long.\n\nBefore releasing the subsatellite, the crew performed another engine burn to raise their orbit. This was designed to allow the subsatellite to last longer. The three-second burn raised their orbit from 65.4 by 52.2 nautical miles (121.1 by 96.7 kilometres) to 76.0 by 54.3 nautical miles (140.8 by 100.6 km). In this new orbit it was expected that the subsatellite would survive for one year.\n\nAs they began their 74th and final orbit of the Moon, the crew positioned the spacecraft for the correct attitude for release. The subsatellite was released on schedule. The release process involved two pyrotechnic bolts being fired to release the satellite which was launched using a spring-loaded mechanism, a pin in a curved groove to impart a spin in the satellite. The spinning helped to stabilise the craft.\n\nAfter having the information needed to burn the SPS to send them home radioed from Mission Control, Apollo 15 disappeared behind the Moon for the last time. Igniting on time, the SPS burned for 2 minutes, 21 seconds, adding 3,050 ft/s (930 m/s) to their speed.\n\nLittle was left for the crew to do on their tenth day in space. They continued to photograph the lunar surface as it receded from them, using up the remaining film. And now they were back in the constant sunlight of cis-lunar space, they put the spacecraft into PTC.\n\nThe main task on the eleventh day in space was an EVA by Worden. This was the first EVA by a Command Module Pilot since Scott performed one on Apollo 9.\n\nAs the crew began their preparations, they left the Lunar Sphere of Influence at 238 hours, 14 minutes, 51 seconds GET, at which point the gravitational pull of the Earth was stronger than that of the Moon. From now on they would start to accelerate towards the Earth. After retracting and turning off the equipment in the SIM bay, the crew donned their space suits. They disabled the RCS thrusters that were near the SIM and if accidentally fired would have been dangerous to Worden. Guards were also placed over the control panel to ensure that switches were not flicked by an errant foot.\n\nAfter suit checks and depressurizing the spacecraft, the hatch was opened. After mounting a TV and film camera on the hatch, Worden jettisoned two bags of rubbish that did not need to be returned to Earth. Then using handholds built into the craft he moved along to the SIM bay. Along with retrieval he was tasked with inspecting the instruments to find the cause for the various problems experienced with them.\n\nFirst he retrieved the film cassette from the Panoramic Camera and returned that to the cabin. After inspecting the \"V-over-H\" sensor on the Mapping Camera he retrieved its film cassette. He found that there was nothing obscuring the sensor as had been postulated by Mission Control as a cause for its problems. Later analysis would find that the problem was related to the optical signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nAs the other instruments had radioed their data back to Earth, there were nothing else to collect. Twenty minutes after opening the hatch, it was closed and locked again. The SIM bay was turned back on so that the X-ray Spectrometer could be pointed at Scorpius X-1 and Cygnus X-1.\n\nDuring the night, the crew set a new space endurance record for the Apollo program (though not for all spaceflight with Gemini 7 having stayed in space for 14 days, and Soyuz 11 for a month). The twelfth day in space for the crew was one of the quietest. As on all Apollo lunar flights, on the return trip there was little left to do, with the main objectives already accomplished.\n\nThe crew undertook another light flash experiment, this time keeping the cabin lights on to see if this affected the visibility. They found that they were less visible.\n\nMission Control ran over the stowage of items in the cabin. It was extremely important that stowed items were placed such that the spacecraft's center of gravity was within the set limits. Especially important were items like the rock samples weighing 170 lb (77 kg) and the 55 lb (25 kg) film cassettes from the panoramic camera.\n\nThe Earth bound portion of the flight coincided with a lunar eclipse. This occurs when the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. The crew was instructed to photograph it but due to the hand-held nature of the cameras and the length of the exposures, most of the photos were blurred. Instruments on the lunar surface left by the crew also recorded the eclipse, though only through noting the drop of the surface temperature by 185 kelvins.\n\nThe crew also conducted an in-flight press conference, with questions having been submitted by members of the press to be read by the CAPCOM. First they were asked what was the event that would like to repeat and any they would not like to. Scott responded that looking down on the plain from Hadley Delta was for him the best moment. For Worden it was LOI, and their first close up views of the Moon and TEI, which meant they were coming home. Irwin enjoyed the launch the most, but would not like to repeat falling down in front of the TV camera while deploying the rover.\n\nMost of the questions centered around the surface operations, such what to the crew were the most important findings. Irwin responded that to him it was the \"organization that was revealed in the side of Mount Hadley\". Scott was asked to describe what it was like to land \"Falcon\". He said that the cratering on the surface was much more subtle than expected making landmark sighting harder. Scott was also asked about the physical workload of doing three 7 hour EVAs. He said that he saw no problem with it and praised their training on the Earth before the mission in preparing them for all possible events.\n\nThe rover was of interest, with Irwin describing it as a bucking bronco that at times only had two wheels still touching the surface. Scott said that he felt it was a very stable machine that in the 1/6 gravity had a tendency to float a bit. Scott was also asked about the drill which he had much trouble with. He said that after about a meter below the surface he ran into hard rock that he was unable to drill through easily. Although he and Irwin had great difficulty extracting the core sample, he felt it was worthwhile.\n\nScott answered a question about the loss of the North Complex by saying that in terms of the original mission objectives, the North Complex was not even mentioned and was only added later. Although personally disappointed, it would have been more of a bonus.\n\nAs always there were questions related to what the American taxpayer was getting out of the mission except for some \"pretty television pictures\". Scott said that man must explore and that along with huge amounts of scientific data, there was the great sense of exploration that came from the flight. Worden and Irwin agreed totally with these sentiments.\n\nWhen asked about the problems on board, the crew thought that they had a very smooth flight except for some popped circuit breakers and the problem with the SPS thrust switch. Irwin said that \"it seemed like a very tame simulation\".\n\nWhen asked to describe his geological observations from orbit, Worden talked about the cinder cones he had seen and how many of the craters they observed, especially on the far side seemed to have been filled by lava flows. The press were also interested in what a man thinks about when he is alone for three days. He responded that with the flight plan there was little time to sit back and think. The three days seemed to go very quickly for him. When asked why on his EVA he had come in so soon, he said that he didn't come in soon, he just came in when the job was finished.\n\nThe sixth course correction was canceled after the press conference. The TEI had the spacecraft on such a good trajectory that it was thought that no further trims were needed. Scott, Irwin, and Worden began their final sleep period at 278 hours.\n\nAfter awaking on their final day in space, the crew shut down the SIM bay for the last time. The gamma-ray spectrometer boom was stowed and all the equipment was made safe. Along with the rest of the service module it would burn up as it reentered the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe final midcourse correction of the mission (MCC-7) or the corridor control burn, was a 21 s RCS thruster, slowing them down by 5.6 ft/s (1.7 m/s). Now all that was left for them to do was separate from the service module and assume the blunt-end-forward orientation.\n\nThe CM's own RCS system was pressurized and the VHF radio link checked. VHF would be used after passing through the radio communications blackout of reentry.\n\nThe separation from the SM was a highly important event. First, a series of pyrotechnic systems were armed; a switch was then flicked to initiate separation. From here an automatic system took over. A timer was started to have the RCS thrusters fire to increase the separation. The electrical connections between the two craft were severed using cannon-style plug and socket connectors that were ejected using small pyrotechnic charges. A pyro-powered guillotine severed the wire bundles and plumbing. Further charges severed tension ties that connected the two modules, which were then pushed apart using springs.\n\nAfter entering the atmosphere, the acceleration built, peaking at 6 \"g\" (59 m/s²). This dropped as they slowed down, coming out of radio blackout. Passing through 7,300 metres (24,000 ft), the apex cover was blown by a pyrotechnic charge. This exposed the two sets of parachutes. First the two drogue parachutes were released, which slowed and stabilized the capsule from 500 km/h to 280 km/h. They pulled out the three large main parachutes some twenty seconds later.\n\nThe recovery forces in the area reported that only two of the main parachutes had inflated. Worden said after splashdown that all three parachutes did inflate properly at first but after dumping the RCS fuel (highly toxic hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide), he noticed that one was not inflated anymore. Post flight analysis would find that two or three of the six shroud lines on the failed parachute were missing. Although no conclusive cause was found, it is thought that the loss of the shroud lines was due to the RCS fuel dump.\n\nThe splashdown point was estimated to be , 330 statute miles (530 km) north of Honolulu, Hawaii and 5.3 n mi (9.8 km) from the prime recovery ship, the USS \"Okinawa\".\n\nThe loss of a parachute was of no consequence for the capsule, which was designed to land safely on just two parachutes, the third parachute being a redundancy in case one parachute had failed. After splashing down the capsule stayed upright, which meant their recovery was not delayed while it righted itself. Frogmen from the \"Okinawa\" were at the capsule within minutes attaching a sea anchor and opening the hatch to get the crew into a life raft. Apollo 15 was the first mission where the crew did not go into quarantine in case of any lunar microorganisms, after it was found from previous flights that the Moon was lifeless.\n\nThey were flown to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. From there they were flown in a Lockheed JetStar to Ellington Air Force Base, Houston.\n\nThe command module is displayed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio\n\n"}

{"id": "2099059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099059", "title": "Apollo 15 operations on the Lunar surface", "text": "Apollo 15 operations on the Lunar surface\n\nApollo 15 lunar surface operations were conducted from July 30 to August 2, 1971, by Apollo 15 Commander David Scott and Apollo Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin, who used the first Lunar Roving Vehicle to make three exploratory trips away from their landing site at the base of the Apennine Mountains, near Hadley Rille.\n\nThey collected a total of of lunar surface material during 18½ hours outside the Lunar Module \"Falcon\".\n\nAt 104 hours, 30 minutes and 12 seconds GET the descent engine of \"Falcon\" ignited. Burning at about 10% for the first 26 seconds so that the guidance computer could gimbal the engine to direct the thrust through the center of gravity of the LM, it then thrust up to 100%. Irwin confirmed that the Abort Guidance System (AGS) agreed with the Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PGNS) on their height and rate of descent.\n\nAt three minutes the computer rolled the spacecraft so that they were now on their back, with the windows facing away from the lunar surface. This was so the landing radar could acquire the surface. Scott then announced the altitude and velocity lights, indicating the computer was getting acceptable data from the radar. Six minutes into the burn they were 30,000 feet (9000 m) above the surface.\n\nIn Mission Control, the Flight Director learned that tracking data indicated they were going to land 3000 feet (900 m) south of the targeted landing site. Although at first he decided not to tell the crew, Ed Mitchell, the CapCom, convinced him otherwise. During this time Scott was trying to see the ground through his window. He thought they were going to land as long as he could see Mount Hadley Delta. He was unable to see the Rille, something that had been possible in the simulators.\n\nNine minutes and ten seconds into the burn, Program 64 started on the computer and the LM pitched forward and the crew could see the ground. Using scribe marks on the window and angles read to him by Irwin, Scott found where the computer was predicting the landing site to be and then used a hand controller to move the predicted location. He did this 18 times during the landing, moving the target site a total of 338 meters (1110 feet) uprange and 409 meters (1341 feet) north.\n\nScott's main problem was that there was very little detail on the surface. The best images of the site only had 66 ft (20 m) resolution and photoanalysers had overenhanced the images. The main problem was overestimating the depth of craters, so as to make them have shadows at higher sun angles. Fortunately he was able to see four craters, Matthew, Mark, Luke and Index (the reason it was called Index and not John was due to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an outspoken atheist who had sued NASA over the reading of Genesis during Apollo 8. Although she lost the case, NASA remained squeamish on overtly religious announcements on later flights).\n\nIrwin began reading the altitude, rate of descent and the projected landing site. At 400 ft (120 m), the computer was switched to Program 66, designed for the landing phase. From now on Scott was flying manually. Irwin stopped reading out the projected landing site. Passing through 120 ft (37 m) Scott said he was picking up some dust. By the time they got to between 60 and 50 ft (18 to 15 m) the view outside would be completely obscured by dust.\n\nIrwin then announced that the contact light had illuminated, indicating one of the landing probes on the LM's feet had contacted the ground. Immediately Scott cut the engine. With the extended engine bell there was a fear that it could touch the ground and cause exhaust to travel back into the engine. It is estimated that they were travelling 6.8 ft/s (2 m/s) when they hit, twice as fast as previous missions. A few seconds later, Scott informed the ground that \"Okay, Houston. The \"Falcon\" is on the Plain at Hadley.\" \"Falcon\" was tilted nearly 10 degrees to its back left, just 5° below the maximum acceptable angle. It set down on the rim of a crater such that its engine bell was damaged, and with one of the legs in the crater. They were about 600 meters north and about 175 meters west of the targeted landing site. This was of little concern though thanks to the capabilities of the rover.\n\nBefore they ventured outside for the first time, Scott and Irwin would sleep. Both had realized that in order to be at their best for their seven-hour Extra-vehicular activity they would need to be rested. But Scott had also learned the need to get an overview of a new survey site before venturing outside. As such he convinced mission planners to let them conduct a stand-up EVA before the first sleep period. It also gave them a stable platform to use a 500 mm telephoto lens that was carried on this mission for the first time. The lens had been a struggle to get on board a spacecraft where weight savings were measured in pounds.\n\nTwo hours after landing, they depressurized the LM and removed the top hatch and docking mechanism. Then, Scott stood on top of the ascent engine cover and put his head outside. Looking around, Scott was familiar with the territory having spent months studying maps of the area. He could easily recognize Mons Hadley, Mons Hadley Delta, the Swan Range, the Silver Spur, Bennett Hill, Hill 305, and the North Complex.\n\nScott's first task was to take a 22-picture stereo panorama of the area using a 60 mm lens. Then he photographed targets of interest with the telephoto lens, and then a color panorama of the area with the 60 mm lens.\n\nHe was able to put to bed any further concerns about the use of the Rover. Radar observations from Earth had given the impression that the area was covered in large boulders that would make it impossible to traverse with the Rover. Scott saw that there was nothing bigger than 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) near them. He then described the features he could see around him. Basically this was to give a general setting of the area and make sure there were no great surprises. Thirty minutes after opening the hatch, Scott re-entered and the hatch was closed and \"Falcon\" repressurized.\n\nThroughout the astronauts' sleep period, Mission Control had watched with some concern as the pressure inside descent stage oxygen tanks of the LM slowly dropped. To conserve power during the night, the LM was run on a low-data-rate telemetry stream, so Mission Control could not tell the exact cause. Unwilling to wake the crew they decided to wait until they had woken up.\n\nIn the end, Flight Director Peter Frank chose to wake the crewmen an hour early and got them to turn back on the high-data-rate telemetry. With this they saw that the valve of the Urine Transfer Device was open even though the receptacle was capped. A total of about 8 out of 95 pounds (3.6 out of 43 kg) of oxygen had been lost. About half of the total amount was reserve. Scott and Irwin would state in the post-flight Technical Debrief that Mission Control should have awakened them as soon as the leak was detected.\n\nOnce they were awake, it was decided to start their preparations for the first lunar EVA of their mission. As with everything in Apollo, it was an involved procedure. Not only did they have to prepare \"Falcon\", but had to don their space suits. \"Apollo 15\" was the first crew that got to sleep in long johns rather than having to stay in their space suits. It would not be until four hours after waking up that Mission Control gave the Go to depressurize the LM.\n\nAs Scott became the seventh man to step onto the lunar surface, he said:\n\nAs I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there's a fundamental truth to our nature. Man must explore. And this is exploration at its greatest.\n\nAfter inspecting the LM, Scott began to unpack the Modularised Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), which was attached to the side of the LM and carried the Apollo TV camera, sample bags, batteries, CO scrubbers for the space suits, and other equipment needed while the astronauts were outside the spacecraft. About seven minutes after Scott stepped outside Irwin is on the surface.\n\nIrwin's first task was to collect a contingency sample of lunar rock. This was collected in case of an emergency, i.e., suddenly having to leave the lunar surface within the first few minutes. In such an event having a contingency sample meant that the crew would not return to Earth empty-handed. However, the contingency sample was not of much value because the ground surrounding the landing site had been disturbed by the LM descent engine.\n\nAfter Scott positioned the TV camera on a tripod so Mission Control could see the deployment of the Lunar Rover, he and Irwin began the process by pulling on two lanyards. These released the Rover and let it swing down on hinges. As it did, it began to unfold. They experienced some problems at first due to the angle the LM was sitting on, but within minutes it was on the ground almost ready to go.\n\nScott had the honor of the first test drive, taking it around the LM. The Rover had both front and back steering, but Scott found that only the rear-wheel steering was working (mysteriously the front steering would be working at the start of the second EVA). Other difficulties came from how their space suits did not bend very much when they sat down. When training on Earth, their body weight had forced the suits down, but on the Moon, they ended up reclining in the seats. Apart from the steering there were no other problems and the crew set about loading up the Rover for their first geological traverse. During lunar surface operations, Commander Scott always drove the rover, while Lunar Module Pilot Irwin was a passenger who assisted with navigation. This division of responsibilities between the two crew positions was used consistently throughout Apollo's J missions.\n\nThe astronauts could not travel any farther than the distance they could walk with the remaining oxygen in their Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS). So the earlier they set out, the farther they could travel. They would travel to the farthest point of the traverse and then work their way back. On EVA-1 they would travel to the base of Hadley Delta via the Rille. Their first target was the crater dubbed Elbow crater, so-called as it sat at a bend in the Rille. The first EVA also served an important task of working out exactly where they had landed. The Rover carried a navigation system that could calculate the distance and direction of a known starting point. By travelling to a known point this could be calibrated.\n\nScott set off at 9 km/h (6 mph), slow by terrestrial standards, but due to the lowness of the chassis of the Rover and the roughness of the surface, the astronauts would say it seemed quite quick. Throughout the journey, the astronauts had trouble identifying where they were. Due to not knowing exactly where the landing site was and over-enhanced maps, little was familiar. But the route chosen for this first drive had been picked with this in mind. By driving along the side of the rille it would be hard to miss their target.\n\nAfter arriving at Elbow, Irwin's first task was to take a panorama of the site. At the same time Scott aligned the S-band antenna of the Rover with the Earth. This allowed Mission Control to operate the TV camera. Ed Fendell was in charge of controlling the camera and took his own pan so geologists in the backroom could see the site. The backroom kept track of everything that astronauts did on geology. As a sample was collected they would note its number, location and description on a card.\nScott and Irwin took a radial sample of the crater, taking samples at increasing distances in a straight line from the rim of the crater. After placing the photocalibration gnomon to the west of each sample, it was photographed, before being collected and placed into a numbered bag. Within ten minutes they had gathered four rock samples and it was time to move onto Station 2 — St George.\n\nFive hundred meters south of Elbow was the 3 km wide St. George crater. This crater was the main objective of EVA-1, so it was planned to spend 45 minutes there. The flight plan had called for them to use the crater as a way of investigating the interior of Hadley Delta by collecting its ejecta. But as they approached they found there was no ejecta so it was decided not to bother visiting the rim of St George. Instead they travelled to a boulder sitting in the open by a 6-meter crater.\n\nThe rock they stopped at was about 5 feet (1.5 m) across. The larger a rock is, the more likely it was formed in the area, instead of being thrown there by an impact. Firstly they took a soil sample at the base of the rock, then another from a small depression down the hill a bit. Scott announced that after this they would roll the rock over and sample the soil from underneath it. After a couple of futile attempts they managed to chip some pieces off it. In \"A Man on the Moon\" Andrew Chaikin writes that Dale Jackson of USGS was having dinner with some astronauts that night in Houston and happily proclaimed that \"they did everything but fuck that rock.\" Other samples in the area were made using a specially designed rake with tines spaced 1 cm apart to collect small pebbles from the regolith. The last task at Station 2 was to take a core sample. This was done using a tube driven into the ground by a hammer.\n\nMission Control announced that it had decided to cancel a planned stop at a crater named Flow due to time constraints. Thus the astronauts boarded the Rover and drove back past Elbow and on their way to the LM. About 125 meters before a crater named Rhysling, Scott spied a large piece of vesicular basalt sitting by itself. Not wanting to just leave it there, he stopped the Rover. The stop was unplanned so he just told Mission Control his seatbelt had come loose, but quickly got off the Rover, ran over to the rock, using his collection tongs for a calibration in the photos, took a sample and got back to the Rover. During this time, Irwin distracted Mission Control by describing the surrounding craters. It was not until the sample boxes returned to Earth that the stop was discovered. The vesicular basalt is sample 15016, and it is sometimes called the seatbelt basalt.\n\nBack at \"Falcon\", Scott and Irwin set about deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). Scott would drill the holes for the heat-flow experiment and put in the probes, while Irwin would set up the rest of the equipment. The ALSEP consisted of the passive seismic experiment, lunar surface magnetometer, solar wind spectrometer, suprathermal ion detector, cold cathode gauge experiment, lunar dust detector and the heat-flow experiment. Not included in the ALSEP but deployed by Irwin as well were the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LRRR) and the Solar Wind Composition Experiment. The ALSEP equipment was attached via cables to the Central Station powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.\n\nScott had major trouble with the drilling. The first 40 cm were easy, but from then on it became more and more difficult. After 1.6 m, half of what was planned, he could get no further and Mission Control told him to just emplace the probes and start on the next hole. The extreme torque had locked the chuck meaning it had to be freed with a wrench, further delaying him. He could only get 1 meter into the ground on the second hole before Mission Control called it a day and told them to return to the LM.\n\nThey had been outside for 6½ hours. Returning to the LM gave the crew a much-needed rest. Irwin was dehydrated as his water bag had not worked, and he had gone over seven hours without liquids.\n\nThe target of the second EVA was Mount Hadley Delta again, but the crew drove via a more direct route and to a site east of where they had travelled the previous day. Travelling at 5.5 mph (9 km/h) they made good time across the plain. The first stop of the day, Station 4 was cancelled to give them more time to finish the drilling the holes for the heat flow experiment. This was at Dune crater, on the western edge of the South Cluster. The astronauts would, however, briefly visit Dune on the return trip to the LM.\n\nAfter making a navigation stop at Spur, they started to travel the 1.9 mi (3 km) along the base of the Delta to reach Station 5, at a site named Front. Scott found there was little variation in the surroundings and decided that Front was going to offer little difference, so it was decided to stop at a site about 1.9 mi (3 km) from St George and 320 ft (100 m) up to the Delta. It was interesting work, with the slope being about 10 degrees. Not reaching Front cancelled Station 5, placing them instead at Station 6.\nThey first sampled a fresh-looking 1-meter crater, that was part of the rim of the older 3-meter crater. More samples were made above the area where they had parked the Rover. Most were breccias, but they did find one porphyritic basalt.\n\nScott decided to move down to a 40 ft (12 m) crater, which was the largest one nearby. He went down inside it to sample, but found most of the rocks to be too large. Mission Control called up and said they would like the crew to dig a trench to study the soil mechanics and take a core sample. Irwin dug the trench, which Scott photographed. Then the core sample was taken from inside the crater.\n\nReturning to the Rover, they drove 650 ft (200 m) to a large boulder. Even walking short distances on the slope was time consuming so it was easier to just have the crew use the Rover to get there. The boulder was 10 ft (3 m) across. It was necessary for one crewmember to stay by the Rover, holding it to make sure it did not slide down the hill, which now had a 15-degree slope. With time running out on the stop, Scott was able to confirm what Irwin had seen earlier — the rock had a greenish tinge. The color was found to come from magnesium oxide.\n\nBack on the Rover, they traveled onward to Spur crater, which was 320 ft (100 m) across and 66 ft (20 m) deep. Reaching the crater's rim they found small fragments, including one with a white vein. At first Irwin thought he had kicked up some green soil, but Scott found it was just caused by the visors of the helmets which were coated gold.\n\nIt was then that they saw what would become the most famous lunar sample collected during the entire Apollo program — sample #15415 or as it was dubbed by the media, the \"Genesis Rock\". It looked at first just like a partially crystalline rock, but the closer they looked they realized it was almost pure plagioclase, meaning it was anorthosite. It was originally thought they had found a piece of the Moon's primordial crust, but later analysis would show that the rock was only 4.1 ± 0.1 billion years old, which is younger than the Moon itself, and was formed after the Moon's crust solidified. But it was still an extremely old sample, and was from the pre-Imbrian era.\n\nWith time running out, and the walk-back constraint approaching, the geology backroom decided that they wanted the astronauts to collect as many small fragments as they could from the area. Irwin had wanted to sample a large breccia but after spending so much time on #15415, there was little time left at the site. They also took some rake samples, netting 78 fragments from the regolith. With only three minutes before they had to move on, Irwin hit a large rock with his scoop, breaking it along one of its fracture lines. The chip they collected would be the second-largest rock collected on the mission.\n\nThey returned to \"Falcon\" along essentially the same path as they came. Passing the South Cluster and Dune, Scott decided to stop and collect some samples. Joe Allen, the CapCom, warned them that they only had ten minutes to spend here. Irwin's camera jammed after acquiring a panorama of the area, forcing Scott to take all the remaining documentation photography. Working quickly, they collected samples, including several from a large basalt boulder on the rim of Dune.\n\nOn returning to the LM, Scott began another attempt at drilling holes for the heat-flow experiment. Irwin took some manual core samples from around the ALSEP site. Again like the previous day the drill continued to get stuck, refusing to go any further. Scott was able to advance a few centimeters by pulling the drill up to clear the flutes on the drill bit and then letting the drill advance only using its own weight. This process however would cause the drill bit sections to come apart, meaning that what Scott was really doing was creating a new obstruction below the surface without realizing it. When he tried to emplace the probes they only went in 3 ft (1 m). Post-flight analysis would find that the drill design was flawed, with the flutes too close together at the joint joining the sections of the stem.\n\nA soil mechanics experiment was undertaken by digging a trench and using a penetrometer to measure the strength of the regolith. Scott began drilling another hole, this time for a deep core sample. At 2.4 meters, Scott decided that this was far enough as they were well below the depth of the heat-flow probes, the main reason for taking the core sample. Not wanting to lose time the next day returning to remove the core, he started to pull it out. He managed to get it up 20 cm but then it refused to move any further.\n\nThe last task of the day was to set up the flag of the United States. They were outside \"Falcon\" for 7 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nOvernight, Mission Control decided to cancel the traverse to the North Complex. Time saved not going there would be spent on pulling out the deep core sample. Although annoyed by this, Scott understood that although he was in command of the mission, he was part of a team, and the mission scientists had decided that the core sample was more important than sampling the North Complex. \nBefore setting off to the ALSEP site, the crew took some customary publicity shots of them and the flag.\n\nBack at the core sample drill, both Scott and Irwin grabbed hold of the drill and tried to pull it out. Slowly but surely, they managed to work it out of the ground by getting up under the drill. A few more tries and it was completely out of the ground. When they came to break the stem apart they found that a vice built into the Rover for the purpose had been installed backwards. Scott by this time was becoming more and more annoyed at the amount of time being spent on this sample and said \"How many hours do you want to spend on this drill, Joe?\"\n\nAnalysis of the core samples found that pebble concentration and density varied dramatically. Along the 7.9 ft (2.4 m) length of the sample, there were more than 50 distinct layers, varying in thickness from 0.2 to 8.2 inches (0.5 to 21 cm). Of particular interest was that the deepest portions of the core samples were too deep for cosmic rays to penetrate, meaning that they had not been affected by recent cosmic ray activity.\n\nThe Rover TV camera was having problems. Any attempt to pan up or down would cause it to flop down, leaving it pointing uselessly at the ground and requiring an astronaut to repoint it.\n\nAfter making a 16 mm film of the Rover driving for the engineers on Earth, they set off for the main target of their last EVA, Hadley Rille. On the way, they stopped to photograph a rock they suspected had formed a crater nearby. There was no time to stop and sample it.\n\nThey arrived at a 50 ft (15 m) crater near to their original target crater, Scarp. Scott decided to stop there as it met the original objective of Scarp, which was to collect debris from near the rille. After taking a panorama of the site, Scott took some samples, finding them to be extremely soft. It is thought that the area around them was the youngest ever walked on by an astronaut.\n\nMoving on, they traveled to the rille. One of the objectives of Apollo 15 was to sample exposed bedrock at its point of origin. On previous missions, the basalt collected had been thrown there by impacts. As Irwin took the site panorama, Scott used the 500 mm telephoto lens to image the far side of the Rille, which was about 0.6 mi (1 km) across. They were looking for layering in the wall of the Rille, which could help geologists to find if the lava flows that had filled Palus Putredinis came in one go or over time.\n\nIrwin started a radial sample. He found a rectangular rock that was too large to return to Earth. Due to the slope of the surrounding area, he was able to see some bedrock below the rim of the Rille that appeared to be above them further along. They walked to a 10 ft (3 m) crater and sampled the meter-sized rocks that it had thrown up.\nIt was meant to be time to move on again, but the geology backroom decided that the loss of another sampling station was offset by the chance of sampling true bedrock, so they were given more time. Moving down to the very edge of the rille, they sampled a 7 ft (2 m) rock. Back at the Rover, they took another rake sample and a core sample. Scott then decided to sample a vuggy, coarsely grained basalt. He decided to take the whole football-shaped rock. Dubbed \"Great Scott\", the 21 lb (9.6 kg) sample would be the biggest returned on \"Apollo 15\" (Sample 15555). They moved on to the last station of the mission, Station 10. With little time left, all they could do was photograph the site at a 200 ft (60 m) crater.\n\nScott had one more thing to do once he returned to the lunar module:\nWell, in my left hand, I have a feather; in my right hand, a hammer. And I guess one of the reasons we got here today was because of a gentleman named Galileo, a long time ago, who made a rather significant discovery about falling objects in gravity fields. And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon? And so we thought we'd try it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time.\n\nAnd they did. Later investigations found that the feather may have been extracted from the wing of a female gyrfalcon. Scott then drove the Rover for the last time to a point 300 ft (90 m) from the LM so that it could observe the liftoff. He placed a small Bible on the hand controller and then walked about 20 ft (6 m) to a small hollow where he placed a plaque bearing the names of the fourteen known astronauts and cosmonauts to have lost their lives (two cosmonaut deaths had not been made public at the time – Valentin Bondarenko and Grigori Nelyubov). Beside it he placed the \"Fallen Astronaut\" statuette.\n\nThey were outside the LM for 4 hours and 50 minutes.\n\nThese are maps from the \"Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report\", edited slightly.

{"id": "2099067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099067", "title": "Sadako Yamamura", "text": "Sadako Yamamura\n\n, also known as Park Eun-suh and Samara Morgan, is the main antagonist of Koji Suzuki's \"Ring\" novel series and the film franchise of the same name. Her name combines the Japanese words for \"chaste\" (\"sada\") and \"child\" (\"ko\"). Sadako's fictional history alternates between continuities, but all depict her as the vengeful ghost of a psychic who was murdered and thrown into a well. As a ghost, she uses nensha, her most distinctive power and weapon, to create a cursed video tape that will kill whoever watches it exactly one week later unless the tape is copied and shown to another person, who then must repeat the same process.\n\nSadako Yamamura has been played by a number of actresses in films, including Rie Inō in \"Ring\" and \"Ring 2\", Hinako Saeki in \"Rasen\", Yukie Nakama in \"\" as the villainous protagonist, Ayane Miura in \"\", Tae Kimura in \"\" and \"Rasen\", and Ai Hashimoto in \"Sadako 3D\". Foreign adaptations renamed the character, with Bae Doona portraying Park Eun-suh in the South Korean film \"The Ring Virus\", and Daveigh Chase portraying Samara Morgan in the American films \"The Ring\" and \"The Ring Two\"; Bonnie Morgan would later take over the role in \"Rings\".\n\nSadako Yamamura appears in Kōji Shiraishi's 2016 crossover film, \"Sadako vs. Kayako\", with the Ju-on antagonist Kayako Saeki. She is portrayed by Elly Nanami.\n\nSadako's initial origin story differs between the novels and the films. In the novels, Sadako was born in 1947 to Shizuko Yamamura and Dr. Heichachiro Ikuma in Oshima Island. The year before, Shizuko gained psychic powers after retrieving an ancient statuette of En no Ozuno from the ocean. Shizuko also gave birth to a baby boy but he died four months later due to an illness. Planning to move to Tokyo with Ikuma, she entrusted her mother to take care of baby Sadako. At Tokyo, at Ikuma's encouragement, Shizuko displays her psychic powers during a publicized demonstration. However, Shizuko bows out of the demonstration due to migraines brought on by her powers. The press denounces Shizuko as a fraud because of this. Depressed, Shizuko eventually returns to Oshima Island for Sadako.\n\nAt the age of nineteen, Sadako joins a Tokyo-based acting troupe and falls in love with the sound operator, Hiroshi Toyama. He learns of her powers but accepts them. Unfortunately, an early form of the curse is created in the form of a sound recording which kills four people including the troupe's director, resulting in a heartbroken Sadako leaving Toyama. Sadako visits Ikuma in hospital, only to be raped by a doctor named Nagao Jotaro who cared for her father. However, he discovers that she had Testicular Feminization Syndrome, possessing the genitalia of both sexes. When Sadako attacks him with her powers, Nagao throws her down a nearby well and seals her within. Foreseeing herself being reborn years later, Sadako vows revenge on the world before she dies.\n\nAs a vengeful ghost, Sadako created a cursed videotape that will kill anyone who watches it 7 days later. Besides wreaking her vengeance upon humanity, Sadako creates the curse to reproduce and ultimately be reborn, something she can not biologically do herself due to being genetically male. The curse is specifically referred to as the \"Ring Virus\", embedded within the cursed videotape, since she will \"live on\" in it, as long as her DNA merged with that of a strand of the smallpox virus, which she contracted from the rape, still exists.\n\nIn the novel \"Spiral\", it unfolds that Sadako intended on resurrecting herself through the power of her curse, actually a mutated biological virus that cause heart attacks or pregnancy in women if the right requirements are met. After Mitsuo Ando and Mai Takano have sex, the latter goes through a rapid pregnancy, giving birth to Sadako, who grows into her adult self in a matter of hours. She uses the virus to clone and resurrect Ryuji Takayama as well, and convinces Ando to spread the virus in the form of Kazuyuki Asakawa's journal of the curse in return for resurrecting his own son Takanori.\n\nIn \"Loop\" and its subsequent sequels, the virus was still present in LOOP, a supercomputer project that stimulates the emergence of life and replicates scenes from the previous novels. After LOOP's creator decides to replicate Ryuji's death, by cloning him and inserting him to someone's womb, the virus was unleashed and mutated into Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), threatening to kill all forms of life.\n\nHer past alters in the film series. Sadako is not the biological child of Dr. Ikuma and Shizuko but is heavily implied to be the result of sexual intercourse between Shizuko and an enigmatic sea demon after Shizuko spent hours staring at the ocean, which is confirmed by her brother Takashi who spied on her from behind. Takashi later learns of Shizuko's psychic prediction of Mount Mihara's eruption and tells everyone about it, making her an instant celebrity. Dr. Ikuma, eager to prove the existence of ESP, encouraged her to participate in a demonstration at Tokyo. During the demonstration, Shizuko was successfully able to prove her psychic abilities but a spiteful journalist, Miyaji, accused Shizuko of being a fraud, inciting other journalists to join in the slanderous uproar. Sadako, who watched from backstage, snapped and killed Miyaji, to stand up for her mother.\n\nSadako eventually split into identical twins, one good and innocent, and the other destructive. After Shizuko committed suicide due to severe depression from the infamous ESP demonstration, Ikuma moved to Izu with the twins. The good Sadako grew into an adult and became an actress, while the evil twin was locked up by Ikuma and drugged to stunt her growth. Sadako's evil self haunted her, leading to her beaten her to death by fellow theatre troupe members, aside from Toyama. Akiko Miyaji, the fiancé of the journalist whom Sadako killed, leads an angry mob to kill the evil Sadako, only for the twins to merge into one and slaughter her tormentors. Ikuma then wounded and threw Sadako down the well behind his house. Sadako survived within for thirty years and died shortly before the events of \"Ring\", creating the cursed videotape.\n\nAt the end of the \"Sadako 3D 2\", Sadako's daughter is revealed, which is briefly described by Kashiwada as \"the seed of despair, growing, and ready to bloom\", which is also the real cause of the deaths, not Nagi, Akane Ayukawa's daughter.\n\nSadako appears in the crossover film \"Sadako vs. Kayako\", encountering Kayako Saeki, the antagonist of the \"Ju-On\" films. Sadako's cursed videotape, in this version, is reduced to a 2-day deadline instead of the traditional 7 day deadline. She is also shown to be much stronger and violent this time, forcing people who try to hinder her curse or escape to kill themselves in brutal ways. The two ghosts battle each other to kill two women who are under both of their respective curses, they are lured to an old well with the help of psychics Keizo Tokiwa and Tamao in an attempt to destroy them both. However, it ends up causing the two ghosts to fuse into Sadakaya. Furthermore, prior to the battle and subsequent fusion, Sadako's curse is inadvertently transferred from the cursed videotape to the Internet, potentially causing her curse to be unleashed by anyone who watches it online.\n\nSadako appears as a young woman whose face is hidden under her long dark hair, and she wears a white dress. This appearance is typical of yūrei. Specifically, Sadako is a type of yūrei known as an onryō, bound by a desire for vengeance. In \"Sadako 3D\", Sadako appears as her human self while still displaying traits of an onryō, in addition to the standard yūrei appearance. \"Ring: Kanzenban\" was the only rendition that differs from a traditional yūrei appearance. She is shown similarly as a young woman with Testicular Feminization Syndrome, yet her hair rarely covers her face and is frequently portrayed nude as opposed to a white garment. Sadako is also an amalgamation of two famous Japanese ghosts, Oiwa and Okiku. From Oiwa, Sadako takes the single, misshapen eye. From Okiku, the style of murder, of being thrown down a well and then having the ghost rise from the well to seek vengeance.\n\nThe success of the 1998 film \"Ring\" brought the image of the yūrei to western popular culture for the first time, although the image has existed in Japan for centuries. This image is often used in J-Horror films, such as \"Ju-on\" (and its remake \"The Grudge\"), \"One Missed Call\" and \"Dark Water\".\n\nSadako is also based on the life of early-20th century psychic Sadako Takahashi, an apparent practitioner of nensha, the art of projecting images onto film by thought alone. In 1931 Takahashi was studied by psychologist Tomokichi Fukurai for his book, \"Clairvoyance and Thoughtography\". Fukurai also worked with psychic Chizuko Mifune, who inspired the backstory of Sadako and her mother Shizuko.\n\nSadako has a variety of psychic powers throughout all the \"Ring cycle\" books and films. The most famous is her ability to create the \"cursed\" video tape.\n\nIn the films her method of killing with the video curse is not explained, but when someone is killed by it she is seen climbing out of a nearby surface, often a television screen, and approaching them. The corpses are discovered with looks of unearthly anguish on their faces.\n\nIn \"Spiral\", the curse is explained in detail, and is discovered to be a virus. When someone watches the cursed tape (or something else carrying the curse) some of their DNA is changed to become that of the Ring Virus (a hybrid of Sadako's DNA and that of the smallpox virus). This travels throughout their body and in most cases causes a sarcoma to form on one of the arteries of their heart. If the curse has not been appeased within seven days, the sarcoma detaches from the artery and clogs it, causing heart failure. Eventually, however, the virus is able to infect people through means other than videotapes, such as a report detailing the events of \"Ring\" written by Kazuyuki Asakawa in which the virus had entered from Asakawa's body, a novel version of the report published by Asakawa's brother, a movie based on the novel (which Sadako was cast as herself in), and finally the Metastatic Human Cancer virus that appears in the third novel, \"Loop\".\n\nEach version of the video tape contains disturbing imagery. The novel version features messages at the start and end of the tape, though the method to removing the curse was recorded over. Most of the footage is from Sadako's perspective, including being sexually assaulted by Nagao Jotaro. The films' incarnation has more abstract imagery, and features an enigmatic figure whose face is obscured by a towel, pointing out to something off-screen. He is collectively referred to as the \"Towel Man\", and is speculated to symbolise Sadako's unknown, possibly otherworldly biological father. He appears in \"Ring\", directing Reiko to Yoichi watching the tape, and later points out the copy she made of the tape, implying he may actually be Ryuji Takayama following his death. The final shot of the tape is of the well, which extends with each viewing, until the deadline of the curse where Sadako emerges from the well and then crawls out of the nearest reflective surface to kill her victim.\n\nAn alternate version of the tape was featured in \"\", portrayed as being recorded during pop singer Nao Matsuzaki's music video, and the deadline for the curse was extended to thirteen days. The American film incarnation is probably the longest, and mostly consists of abstract imagery or exaggerated visions that Samara Morgan has seen, but still adapts a lot from the Japanese version including the infamous final sequence where Samara emerges from a television to kill her victims.\n\nSadako was the source for the character Park Eun-Suh from the 1999 Korean remake, \"The Ring Virus\". She is portrayed by Korean actress Bae Doona.\n\nPark Eun-Suh more closely resembles the Sadako from the novels. She appears to be about the same age as Sadako, though her age is never confirmed; she is only said to have disappeared after high school. She and her mother both had supernatural powers (similar to Sadako and Shizuko) and were rumored to be witches. After Eun-Suh's mother throws herself off a cliff into the sea, Eun-Suh's powers mysteriously disappear. As she grows older, she works at a nightclub under the name \"Sunny Park\". Her powers return. She is able to turn on an unplugged TV, and murders a man with her abilities after she catches him peeping on her showering.\n\nEun-Suh is raped by her half brother shortly before her death, during which he discovers that she is a hermaphrodite. She is ashamed, and telepathically threatens him. Horrified, he chokes her unconscious and drops her in a nearby well at the Sanitarium he was staying at for smallpox.\n\nSadako was the main influence on Samara Morgan from the 2002 American remake, \"The Ring\" and its sequels, \"The Ring Two\" and \"Rings\". She was played by Daveigh Chase, Kelly Stables and Bonnie Morgan, respectively. Samara Morgan is depicted as an otherworldly little girl, responsible for the creation of the cursed videotape from the American version of the \"Ring\" story. Her usual appearance is of a girl with long, dark hair covering her face and wearing a white dress. Samara possesses the power of nensha like Sadako, capable of burning images onto surfaces and into the minds of others. Unlike Sadako, Samara psychically disfigures her victims' faces before they finally die of a heart attack.\n\nSamara's history is covered through the American films. \"The Ring\" explains that Samara is adopted by Anna and Richard Morgan (Shannon Cochran and Brian Cox), who own a horse ranch on Moesko Island, Washington. As Samara grows older, her powers burn horrible images into her adoptive mother's mind, nearly driving her insane. Richard banishes Samara to live in the ranch's barn, but she uses her powers to drive Anna's beloved horses to suicide. At some point, Samara is taken to a psychiatric hospital but the doctors are unable to explain how she created the images. During a family vacation on Shelter Mountain, Anna attacks Samara as she stands before an old well, suffocating her with a garbage bag and then dropping her down the well. Anna then commits suicide by jumping off a cliff. However, Samara clings to life for seven days alone in the well before dying from a combination of starvation and hypothermia. Eventually, a set of rental cabins are built near the well, one on top of it. This allows Samara to project her visions into a VCR tape, creating the seven-day curse. Samara's curse kills Katie (Amber Tamblyn), the niece of journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), who investigates the tape's origins. Rachel, her ex-boyfriend Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) and their son Aidan (David Dorfman) all watch the video. Rachel meets Richard, who warns her to stay away and then kills himself via electrocution. Rachel and Noah eventually find Samara's corpse in the well and bury it. Unfortunately, this releases a corporeal, grotesque form of Samara's spirit and she kills Noah as per the rules of the curse. Rachel destroys the original video cassette in a fit of rage, but uses a copied version of the video to continue the curse in order to save Aidan.\n\n\"The Ring Two\" expands upon Samara's backstory: her mother, a woman named Evelyn (Sissy Spacek and Mary Elizabeth Winstead), believed that her daughter had a demon inside her and tried to drown the girl, but she was prevented by nuns. Evelyn is sent to an insane asylum, while Samara was put up for adoption. In the film's present timeline, Samara deliberately manipulates the tape to get back to Rachel, having decided to make Rachel her new mother. After Rachel burns the tape, Samara possesses Aidan. Rachel drugs Samara and then nearly drowns Aidan to exorcise her. Samara retreats to a television set, Rachel being willingly pulled into Samara's visionary world and down the well. Rachel climbs out of the well with Samara pursuing her, but Rachel covers the seal on the well just in time.\n\nIn \"Rings\", expands further back on Evelyn's backstory, Evelyn, (Kayli Carter), was kidnapped by a local priest, Galen Burke (Vincent D'Onofrio), who raped and impregnated her which led to Samara's conception during Evelyn's captivity. Years after his daughter's death, Burke sealed Samara's remains in a wall of his house at some point after the events of the first film, knowing her spirit still plagues those who have encountered her. He also blinded himself so Samara couldn't kill him.\n\nSamara has been looking for a compassionate host in order to be reborn, which she finds in the high school graduate, Julia (Matilda Lutz). Burke tries to kill Julia, but Samara rises out of Julia's iPhone, restores Burke's sight, and kills him. After the cremation of her remains, Samara's spirit now resides in Julia. In the film's closing scenes, Samara's video begins spreading online and goes viral.\n\nA number of actresses have portrayed Sadako in the numerous films and television adaptations of the novels, as well as in foreign adaptations.\n\n\n\n\nThe character of Sadako and particularly Samara Morgan have been well received by audiences and film critics alike. \"The Movie Book\" describes Sadako as influencing the whole Japanese horror genre, making the mythological image of the yurei popular in film. British film critic Mark Kermode lists Sadako's iconic crawl out of a television set as his seventh scariest moment from the horror film genre. The scene also came sixth in Channel 4's \"100 Greatest Scary Moments\". On August 10, 2002, Sadako was given a public funeral at the Laforet Museum in Harajuku, Tokyo, to tie-in with the opening of a \"Ring\" exhibit at the museum and the release of \"The Ring\", with Koji Suzuki attending the funeral. \"Empire\"'s Mark Dinning described Samara as one of the film industry's most \"unrelenting, unreasonable, plain uncontrollable baddies ever.\" Brandon Santiago has cited Samara Morgan as the inspiration for his Tapas webcomic series \"Erma\". Daveigh Chase has been praised for her performance as Samara Morgan, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain at the 2003 ceremony.\n"}
{"id": "2099069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099069", "title": "Solo operations of Apollo 15", "text": "Solo operations of Apollo 15\n\nDuring the 1971 Apollo 15 mission to the Moon, and its three days of exploration on the lunar surface by David Scott and James Irwin, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Al Worden had a busy schedule of observations. Apollo 15 was the first mission to carry the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay, which contained a panoramic camera, gamma ray spectrometer, mapping camera, laser altimeter and mass spectrometer. Worden had to operate the shutter and lenses on the cameras and turn on and off the various instruments. During the coast back to Earth, he would perform an EVA to retrieve film cassettes from the cameras.\nMany of his observations were of far side features that had not been seen in great detail. The panoramic camera was a modified version of the U.S. Air Force's KA-80A camera for its spy satellites, using a 610 mm f/3.5 lens. This particular camera was similar to those used by the Lockheed U-2, A-12 \"Oxcart\" and SR-71 \"Blackbird\". It could see features as small as 3 ft (1 m) across on the lunar surface. It would take long strips, 205 by 13 mi (330 by 21 km) of the surface, on 3.8 foot by 4.5 inch (114.8 by 11.4 cm) strips of film. Over the course of the mission it would take 1,529 usable images, exposing 2 km of film. The film cassette weighed 55 lb (25 kg).\n\nThe other camera in the SIM bay was the Mapping Camera. This consisted of two cameras, the Metric Camera and the Stellar Camera. The Metric Camera took square frames of film, covering about 27,000 km² of the lunar surface, with a resolution of about 20 m. Using the stellar camera, Réseau plates (which added the familiar crosses to Apollo photographs), and other data provided by the laser altimeter, it was possible to identify the exact position on the lunar surface of the photograph taken. A total of 2,240 usable photographs were produced.\n\nThe Laser Altimeter could measure the height of the CSM above the lunar surface to within one meter. It used a pulsed ruby laser operating at 694.3 nanometers and 200 millijoule pulses of 10 nanoseconds duration. The Stellar Camera was used during the runs of the Laser Altimeter on the night side of the Moon. It would show the exact position of the laser beam, for calibration of the altimeter's results.\n\nDuring his first pass over the landing site, after landing, Worden attempted to see \"Falcon\" using the 28 times magnification sextant. He was successful, refining the position of the site. This was of great help to mission planners as it would help them further refine the planning of the traverses by Scott and Irwin, and also help with photographic interpretation from the surface.\n\nAnother experiment performed on Apollo 15 involved using the radio signal of \"Endeavour\" and was termed the Downlink bistatic radar Experiment to find the dielectric constant of the surface material. During the 17th near side pass, while Worden was eating his dinner, the spacecraft was oriented so that its radio signal would reflect off the Moon and be received by the Earth. The strength of this signal varies with the angle of incidence. The Brewster's angle is when the signal is the weakest and is a function of the dielectric constant.\n\nBefore going to sleep, Worden orientated the spacecraft best for the various experiments of the SIM bay, specifically the spectrometers.\n\nThe Gamma-ray Spectrometer detected radiation with energies of 1 MeV to 10 MeV. As the gamma ray passed through a cylinder of doped sodium iodide, it would emit light that would be detected by a photomultiplier tube. Another photomultiplier tube detected charged particles that passed through a plastic shield around the cylinder. All of this was on the end of a 25 ft (7.6 m) boom that would be deployed and retracted periodically during the mission. It sat at the end of the boom so that it would not be contaminated by the spacecraft.\n\nThe Alpha Particle Spectrometer measured the alpha particles emitted by the surface, specifically by the gaseous radon-222 and radon-220. It was optimized to detect particles of energies of 4.7 to 9.1 MeV. It was built into the same casing as the X-ray Spectrometer.\n\nThe X-ray Spectrometer was used to investigate the properties of the upper layers of the lunar surface. As solar X-rays strike the surface, they cause the elements to fluoresce X-rays with well defined energies. The spectrometer could measure these and determine the composition of the lunar surface.\n\nWorden's first full day of solo operations was much the same as the previous day. He spent much of his time switching various experiments on and off and acquiring photographs of targets of interest on the lunar surface.\n\nEven after one day in orbit, mission scientists were extremely pleased with the data returned by the spectrometers. However, due to orbital mechanics, they would only get data from the part of the Moon along their orbital track. During the six days in lunar orbit, the Moon only rotated about 20% and the spacecraft's orbit was only inclined by 26°. So only a small amount of the lunar surface was actually covered. Ideally for scientists, a mission would be placed in a polar orbit for a month, from where it could observe the entire lunar surface.\n\nLunar scientists were particularly interested in rocks that had higher concentrations of samarium, uranium, thorium, potassium and phosphorus. They gave these rocks the acronym KREEP (potassium (atomic symbol K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P)). The gamma-ray spectrometer was designed to detect these types of rocks. They had been found at the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 landing sites but not at the Apollo 11 site, which was about 1,000 km to the east of the Apollo 14 site. At the time of Apollo 15, scientists were interested in whether KREEP rocks were found all over the Moon or just in the region around 12 and 14. It is believed that KREEPs represent the last chemical remnants of the \"magma ocean\" after the lunar crust formed. KREEPs floated to the surface because their component elements are \"incompatible\", that is, they did not incorporate into compact crystal structures. In the late 1990s, results from Lunar Prospector's gamma ray spectrometer shows that KREEP-containing rocks are concentrated in the Mare Imbrium rim, the near side maria and highlands near Imbrium and the Mare Ingenii South Pole-Aitken basin and are distributed at a lower level in the highlands. The distribution seen by Lunar Prospector supports the idea that the impact which formed Mare Imbrium excavated KREEP-rich rocks and ejected them over the Moon, and the South Pole-Aitken basin impact also exposed KREEP-rich material.\n\nOne of the more personal things that Worden did during the mission was how he greeted Mission Control after reappearing from behind the Moon on each orbit. He and Farouk El-Baz had decided to use the phrase \"Hello Earth; Greetings from \"Endeavour\"\" but in different languages, ranging from Arabic to Spanish.\n\nProblems developed with the Panoramic Camera. It used what was called a \"V-over-H\" sensor to measure the motion of the surface beneath it, from which is worked out how to move the camera to compensate for this motion. From the beginning this sensor had begun to play up, with only about 80% of images being without some blurring. It would not affect the camera greatly but was an annoyance.\n\nOne of the targets of particular interest was the crater Aristarchus. In 1963, Jim Greenacre saw a reddish glow in the region. This was confirmed by four other observers including the then-director of the Lowell Observatory. Apollo 15 was the first manned spacecraft to pass over the site. At the time it was not in direct sunlight but was illuminated by light reflected off the Earth — Earthshine. Worden did not see any glows, even though he described it as being \"so bright in Earthshine, it's almost as bright, it seems like, as it is in sunshine. Very, very bright crater.\"\n\nA regular task for the crew was exercise. It had been found on even the short duration flights, the crews became weakened due to the lack of gravity. The Exergym was a bungee cord that the crew would pull on to keep their shoulders and arms strong. Worden would also fold away the center couch and jog on the stop. Other exercises the crew found that they could do were to position themselves between the bulkhead and the couches and to do kneebends against their arms. During the Technical Debrief at the end of the mission, the crew said that although it was planned for all of them to do equal amounts of exercise, Worden did twice as much, as he was in weightlessness for the entire mission, while the other two would spend three days in the one-sixth gravity of the Moon.\n\nDuring a pass over the Littrow region, Worden reported seeing \"small, almost irregular shaped cones\", which he said looked like cinder cones. This observation would become one of the main reasons for going there on Apollo 17. It would turn out that one of these 'cinder cones' was just an impact crater, when visited by Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17 and that what in fact he was seeing were young craters with dark ejecta blankets. Evidence did emerge for volcanic activity at Shorty when orange soil was found there. This was composed of orange glass beads which were sprayed while molten from a fumarole or \"fire fountain\" 3.64 billion years ago.\n\nDuring the third day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some problems with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located on the end of a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the guide slot. Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17.\n\n146 hours after launch, Worden position the spacecraft so that he could take photographs of the region of the 'sky' opposite the Sun, in hopes of seeing the gegenschein. This faint glow is thought to be caused by tiny particles in the interplanetary medium reflecting light back at the observer. Due to aiming errors, no useful data was returned. Other non-lunar targets were the zodiacal light and the corona of the Sun.\n\nThe fourth solo day was an extremely busy one, for both crews. Scott and Irwin had a five-hour LEVA and for liftoff from the Moon. Worden would then have to perform a rendezvous and docking with the LM.\n\nBefore all of this, Worden had to perform a plane change burn. During the three days, the orbital path of \"Endeavour\" had drifted so that it no longer passed over the landing site. As such, without this burn, rendezvous would have been complicated. This was an 18-second burn of the SPS, coming just after \"Endeavour\" reappeared from behind the Moon on its 45th orbit.\n\nWorden then attempted to make a sighting of \"Falcon\" on the surface. This was done to provide accurate information of the new orbit of the CSM, to help with the upcoming rendezvous. However he had difficulty due to the Sun having risen higher, making the relief much less and the surface much brighter.\n\n"}

It stars Henry Fonda, Lily Pons, and Lucille Ball in one of her earlier roles. It has been described as a \"somewhat wispy operetta.\" Songs are by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields. The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Sound Recording (Carl Dreher).\n\nAnnette Monard Street (Lily Pons) is an aspiring singer, who falls in love with and marries Jonathan Street (Henry Fonda), a struggling young composer.\n\nJonathan pushes her into a singing career, and she soon becomes a star. Meanwhile, Jonathan is unable to sell his music, and he finds himself jealous of his wife's success.\n\nConcerned about their relationship, Annette uses her influence to get Jonathan's work turned into a musical comedy. Once she achieves this, she then retires from public life in order to raise a family.\n\n\nWriting for \"The Spectator\" in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review. Greene criticized Jerome Kern's musical score as \"pompous and middle-aged\" in contrast to the times which were more in line with fresh musicians like Cole Porter, and he complained that Grace Moore's performance had seemed \"ponderous\". The only portion of the film that Greene found to provide a light touch was that of the performing seal.\n\nThe film recorded a loss of $350,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "2099076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099076", "title": "Joe Cinque's Consolation", "text": "Joe Cinque's Consolation\n\nJoe Cinque’s Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law is a non-fiction book written by Australian author Helen Garner, and published in 2004. It is an account of Garner's presence at the separate trials of Anu Singh and her friend Madhavi Rao, who were accused of murdering Singh's boyfriend Joe Cinque and Garner's attempts to understand the events that led to his death, as well as the legal and personal responses to the crime. The book was adapted into a 2016 film of the same name.\n\nA national bestseller, the book has sold 100,000 copies.\n\nAnu Singh, a law student at Canberra's Australian National University, killed her boyfriend Joe Cinque on 26 October 1997 with a lethal dose of heroin, after she had laced his coffee with Rohypnol. A number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him and some were present at parties she held in which he was drugged; none of these friends alerted authorities or police. She was subsequently found guilty of his manslaughter. The most involved of the friends, Madhavi Rao, was acquitted of all charges. Rao moved abroad and adopted a new identity after the conclusion of the trials, while Singh was released from prison in 2001.\n\n\"Joe Cinque's Consolation\" begins with Garner being informed of Singh's second 1999 trial and its circumstances, when it was already in progress. She becomes interested and travels from her Sydney residence to attend the hearings in Canberra. She relates her impressions of the trial, including her negative reactions to Singh and her mystification at Rao's and others' lack of shock at and complicity in Singh's plans, which she determines to be a state of apathy and abandonment of compassion. As the trial progresses she becomes acquainted with Cinque's mother Maria and feels that the court system is not distributing sufficient justice to the victim or his family.\n\nAfter the trial Garner interviews Singh's family and attempts to interview Singh and Rao, but both refuse or are uncontactable. Because of Singh's refusal to be interviewed or contacted, Garner bases most of her information about the woman from erstwhile friends, anecdotal evidence and court transcripts. Singh is portrayed as socially gifted and ambitious, but highly narcissistic, with significant self-esteem issues. Additionally, Garner notes the accused kept diaries about her interactions with men as a teen in which she treated them as disposable commodities, wore high heels to high school, and according to anecdotal evidence from her former best friend, treated Cinque with an element of derision–sometimes mocking him and making jibes about what she thought was a lack of intellect and sophistication to her friends. Some of Singh's former friends thought her to be shallow, self-obsessed and desperate for male approval.\n\nAs the book progresses, Garner becomes interested in victim's rights, interviews the presiding judge and repeatedly visits and becomes a friend of Cinque's family, and eventually concludes that the purpose of the book is to be consolation for Joe Cinque, as the trial proceedings could not be.\n\nGarner uses the case to explore far-reaching themes of human behaviour, culpability and responsibility, duty of care, victims' rights and crime/punishment. She also touches on issues that range from the nature of human memory, including how it is not explicitly clear or cohesive, nor is it linear, and thus under cross-examination in a courtroom, any kind of lapse in memory, or contradiction of a preceding statement, may portray a person as a liar or an unworthy witness.\n\nClass and cultural clashes are drawn between the working class Italian-Australian family of the Cinques, compared to the \"professional class\" Indian-Australian family of the Singhs. That comparison starkly juxtaposes the blue-collar or working class Cinques (although Joe Cinque had a degree in engineering), from a working-class Newcastle suburb with the middle class status of the Singhs, who lived in comfortable inner-west Sydney.\n\nFurthermore, the use of psychiatry in law, is alluded to various times. Garner questions whether a \"psychological sophistication\" that has developed in light of modern behavioural science overrides the fact that some actions are plainly wrong and should be punishable, regardless of the pathology of the person who commits them. She poses this question in reference to Anu Singh. Singh's defence team used her \"abnormality of mind\" (a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and psychotic depression was referenced in the court proceedings) as an explanation for her killing Cinque, akin to the insanity defense.\n\nFinally, Garner laments on the perfunctory decision that the Crown psychiatrist would not be given direct access to Singh, and her diagnosis would be made instead on the basis of transcripts and interviews with mental health professionals in the past – Garner admits this \"floored\" her. Additionally, one reviewer writing for the \"Australian Book Review\" opined that it was Maria Cinque who called out the \"flaky moral relativism\" of the ANU students who were indifferent to Singh's plans, as well as the Canberra courts, the defence lawyers and the judge who handled the case. The complicity of the students, and whether or not they played a role in Cinque's death by not alerting authorities, was also a topic debated extensively throughout the text.\n\n\"Joe Cinque's Consolation\" was reviewed in a number of major newspapers and magazines. It was praised for Garner's writing and its positioning as Joe Cinque's story. Criticisms of the book centered on it failing to tell the story it set out to tell, particularly its inability to explain Singh or her actions and her failure to engage with the purpose of the adversarial justice system. Some saw this as a deliberate attempt by Garner – to honour Cinque, whose family had been not been given a voice or adequate justice by the court. In his review for the \"Australian Book Review\", Peter Rose remarked that \"books such as Joe Cinque’s Consolation often dignify the parents’ agony and indignation. In Maria Cinque we have one of the great stalwarts in this literature of loss. She is always there in court – listening, occasionally hissing and weeping, raging when she must. ‘They were keeping vigil,’ Garner says, marvelling at the Cinques’ stamina. Which is what Garner becomes conscious of doing.\" He further commented on the book being Garner's conscious testament to the injustice dealt to Joe Cinque and his family: \"For what are these books but tributes to the dead, swipes at our forgetfulness, minor consolations for the living: the parents and siblings and friends who feel devastated and betrayed? One thinks of all the unattested lives, the little murders\".\n\nElisabeth Hanscombe, writing for Academia, wrote that Garner's writing, and her depiction of Anu Singh, addressed the notion that for a layperson it \"may perhaps be difficult to understand that someone can be extremely intelligent, can function well academically, be beautiful and at the same time be seriously disturbed\".\n\nOne reviewer compared it with \"The First Stone\" (1995), noting that it was less about the underlying debates and more about the story. Another, Maryanne Dever (writing for the \"Australian Women's Book Review\") criticised similarities in the themes of both books, particularly Garner's perceived hostility to the women subjects and their physical appearance.\n\nThe cover of the re-printed edition from 2006 contains a blurb extracted from a review in \"The Bulletin\", which reads: \"A book which functions at one level as a psychological mystery, but at deeper levels is an exploration of the adequacy of the law to dispense justice, and the responsibility that human beings have to each other...It is told with compassion, a singular kind of honesty, and unadorned intelligence\".\n\nBoth Singh herself and Cinque's parents gave interviews shortly after the book's release. Singh recounted her own memories of the killing and her feelings about it after her release and expressed regret at not agreeing to an interview by Garner. She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her.\n\nMaria Cinque said that she would never forgive Singh for killing her son and did not believe her defence against the murder charge. Garner also stated that she still did not understand or empathise with Singh, although some aspects of her behaviour resonated.\n\n\nTwelve years after publication, the book was adapted into a 2016 film by writer/director Sotiris Dounoukos and Matt Rubinstein, and produced by Matt Reeder of Night Kitchen Productions. Principal photography ran for seven weeks in Canberra during April to June 2015. There was a principal cast of around 40 main and supporting characters, plus around 300 extras.\n"}
{"id": "2099084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099084", "title": "Zosimos of Panopolis", "text": "Zosimos of Panopolis\n\nZosimos of Panopolis () was an Egyptian-born Greek alchemist and Gnostic mystic who lived at the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th century AD. He was born in Panopolis, present day Akhmim, in the south of Roman Egypt, and flourished ca. 300. He wrote the oldest known books on alchemy, which he called \"Cheirokmeta,\" using the Greek word for \"things made by hand.\" Pieces of this work survive in the original Greek language and in translations into Syriac or Arabic. He is one of about 40 authors represented in a compendium of alchemical writings that was probably put together in Constantinople in the 7th or 8th century AD, copies of which exist in manuscripts in Venice and Paris. Stephen of Alexandria is another.\n\nArabic translations of texts by Zosimos were discovered in 1995 in a copy of the book \"Keys of Mercy and Secrets of Wisdom\" by Ibn Al-Hassan Ibn Ali Al-Tughra'i', a Persian alchemist. Unfortunately, the translations were incomplete and \n\nseemingly non-verbatim. The famous index of Arabic books, \"Kitab al-Fihrist\" by Ibn Al-Nadim, mentions earlier translations of four books by Zosimos, however due to inconsistency in transliteration, these texts were attributed to names \"Thosimos\", \"Dosimos\" and \"Rimos\"; also it is possible that two of them are translations of the same book.\nFuat Sezgin, a historian of Islamic science, found 15 manuscripts of Zozimos in six libraries, at Tehran, Cairo, Istanbul, Gotha, Dublin and Rampur. Michèle Mertens analyzed what is known about those manuscripts in her translation of Zozimos, concluding that the Arabic tradition seems extremely rich and promising, and regretting the difficulty of access to these materials until translated editions are available.\n\nIn about 300 CE, Zosimos provided one of the first definitions of alchemy as the study of \"the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies.\"\n\nIn general, Zosimos' understanding of alchemy reflects the influence of Hermetic and Gnostic spiritualities. He asserted that the fallen angels taught the arts of metallurgy to the women they married, an idea also recorded in the \"Book of Enoch\" and later repeated in the Gnostic \"Apocryphon of John\". In a fragment preserved by Syncellus, Zosimos wrote:\n\nThe external processes of metallic transmutation—the transformations of lead and copper into silver and gold were said to always to mirror an inner process of purification and redemption. In his work \"Concerning the true Book of Sophe, the Egyptian, and of the Divine Master of the Hebrews and the Sabaoth Powers\", Zosimos wrote:\n\nGreek alchemists used what they called ὕδωρ θεῖον, meaning both \"divine water\", and \"sulphurous water\". For Zosimos, the alchemical vessel was imagined as a baptismal font, and the tincturing vapours of mercury and sulphur were likened to the purifying waters of baptism, which perfected and redeemed the Gnostic initiate. Zosimos drew upon the Hermetic image of the \"krater\" or mixing bowl, a symbol of the divine mind in which the Hermetic initiate was \"baptized\" and purified in the course of a visionary ascent through the heavens and into the transcendent realms. Similar ideas of a spiritual baptism in the \"waters\" of the transcendent pleroma are characteristic of the Sethian Gnostic texts unearthed at Nag Hammadi. This image of the alchemical vessel as baptismal font is central to his \"Visions\", discussed below.\n\nOne of Zosimos' texts is about a sequence of dreams related to Alchemy, and presents the proto-science as a much more religious experience. In his dream he first comes to an altar and meets Ion, who calls himself \"the priest of inner sanctuaries, and I submit myself to an unendurable torment.\" Ion then fights and impales Zosimos with a sword, dismembering him \"in accordance with the rule of harmony\" (referring to the division into four bodies, natures, or elements). He takes the pieces of Zosimos to the altar, and \"burned (them) upon the fire of the art, till I perceived by the transformation of the body that I had become spirit.\" From there, Ion cries blood, and horribly melts into \"the opposite of himself, into a mutilated anthroparion\"—which Carl Jung perceived as the first concept of the homunculus in alchemical literature.\n\nZosimos wakes up, asks himself, \"Is not this the composition of the waters?\" and returns to sleep, beginning the visions again—he constantly wakes up, ponders to himself and returns to sleep during these visions. Returning to the same altar, Zosimos finds a man being boiled alive, yet still alive, who says to him, \"The sight that you see is the entrance, and the exit, and the transformation ... Those who seek to obtain the art (or moral perfection) enter here, and become spirits by escaping from the body\"—which can be regarded as human distillation; just as how distilled water purifies it, distilling the body purifies it as well. He then sees a Brazen Man (another homunculus, as Jung believed any man described as being metal is perceived as being a homunculus), a Leaden Man (an \"agathodaemon\" and also a homunculus, but see also Agathodaemon the alchemist). Zosimos also dreams of a \"place of punishments\" where all who enter immediately burst into flames and submit themselves to an \"unendurable torment.\"\n\nJung believed these visions to be a sort of Alchemical allegory, with the tormented homunculi personifying transmutations—burning or boiling themselves to become something else. The central image of the visions are the Sacrificial Act, which each Homunculus endures. In alchemy the dyophysite nature is constantly emphasized, two principles balancing one another, active and passive, masculine and feminine, which constitute the eternal cycle of birth and death. This is also illustrated in the figure of the uroboros, the dragon that bites its own tail (and which appears earliest in the Chrysopoeia). Self-devouring is the same as self-destruction, but the unison of the dragon's tail and mouth was also thought of as self-fertilization. Hence the text of \"Tractatus Avicennae\" mentions \"the dragon slays itself, weds itself, impregnates itself.\" In the visions, circular thinking appears in the sacrificial priest's identity with his victim and in the idea that the homunculus into whom Ion is changed devours himself—he spews fourth his own flesh and rends himself with his own teeth. The homunculus therefore stands for the uroboros, which devours itself and gives birth to self. Since the homonculus represents the transformation of Ion, it follows that Ion, the uroboros, and the sacrificer are essentially the same.\n\nThis book is divided into 13 chapters, each of them being introduced by a separate image. \nTwo chapters contain a whole series of images, which - according to Zosimos’ statements - are meant to be pondered upon in order to better understand his teaching.\n\nThe whole text gives a lively dialogue between an alchemical couple: i.e. Zosimos and his female student Theosebeia, revolving about Zosimos' teaching. It reports Theosebeia's complaining about unclear statements of Zosimos as well as Zosimos' anger about her inability to understand his statements. At first sight, the dialogue deals with question upon how to understand statements of alchemical philosophers like Agathodaimon, Democritos, Isis, Moses, Maria, Ostanes, as well as with questions about technical aspects of the alchemical work. But again and again, Zosimos emphasises that he does not talk about the substances and processes as such, as matter, but that they have to be understood symbolically. Zosimos describes the alchemical work by means of a series of images and says to Theosebeia: \"What I wrote and told you, and with the picture I made for you with me in it, I gave you what you need to know, and this should be enough for you.\". He also states, that these images depict his own innerpsychic process of transformation.\n\nZosimos' teaching is based on the one hand on his own dream visions, reported in the text. Another source for his teaching was his suffering of a passionate love relationship to Theosebeia, being not allowed to be simply lived out physically. This led him to understand the alchemical work as psychic transformation, enabling the adept to hold and contain the fire of attraction. Correspondingly, Zosimos drew symbolic images of his own death and resurrection as explanation for Theosebeia.\nFollowing Abt, the book can be regarded as the earliest historical description of an alchemical work based on a psychic transformation.“ And it “is a testimony of the painstaking quest to understand not only the problem but also the meaning of attraction, repulsion and ultimate reconciliation between the outer male and female as well as the inner fire and water” a process that “is described […] with basic substances, mirroring the very elemental, collective character of this process.”\n\nIn this book, we find fragments of writings from „The Sulfurs“, which are ascribed to Zosimos and from his “Letters to Theosebeia”. In the course of the dialogue, those fragments seem to be interrupted by Theosebeia's questions and by further explanations. By this, Zosimos’ teaching is presented in an easier and more understandable way, as Abt holds.\n\nWith regard to content and style, there are similarities between both books, \"the Book of Pictures\" and the \"Book of Keys\" (see there).\n\nUp to now, only one single Arabic manuscript of the \"Book of Pictures\" is extant. In the fourth part of the \"Book of the Rank of the Sage (Rutbat al-Ḥakīm) its author Maslama al-Qurțubī (formerly wrongly assigned to Maslama al-Magriti) quotes extensively from the “Book of Pictures”. He is the first author quoting it, but using another Greek original than the one published in 2015 than the version published 2015 (CALA III, by Th. Abt) and has influenced several alchemists like the early Arabic alchemist Ibn Umail, the \"Kitab al-Habib\" (Book of the Friend/Lover; including a dialogue between a so-called Rusam and Theosebeia) and the alchemist \"Hermes of Dendera\", author of \"Risalat as-Sirr\" (Epistle of the Secret; including a similar dialogue between Hermes Budasir und Amnutasiya). Other traits of Latin symbolic alchemy, like the traditional division of the work in 12 parts or the representation of inner and outer relationship between adept and soror mystica (e.g. in \"Rosarium Philosophorum\" and in \"Mutus Liber\") can be traced back to this book and seem to be influcend by it. Fragments of the text of the \"Book of Pictures\" can be found in \"Rosarium Philosophorum\" and \"Artis Auriferae\". (e.g. titled \"Tractatus Rosini ad Euticiam\" (=\"Treatise of Rosinus to Euticia\").\n\nThe Book of Pictures itself is influenced by Ancient Egyptian thinking, its iconography showing relations to pharaonic iconography and having motifs paralleling Egyptian books of the underworld like Amduat, which was known until Greek-Roman times.\nRegarding the inner and outer relationship between man and woman or between psychic male and female aspects, the \"Book of Pictures\" forms a cultural bridge between pharaonic thoughts and European medieval alchemy.\n\nThis book is written as commentary in 10 chapters on \"the Book of the 10 Keys\", a work ascribed to Democritus (Democritus of Abdera or Pseudo-Democritus). As at the beginning of the book (fol. 41a.3-4) is written, this commentary was Zosimos’ last text written for Theosebeia. According to Abt, the book gives an essence of Zosimos’ teachings, as the preamble says, that the book is so clear and understandable, that after its reading, Theosebeia \"understood the [alchemical] work\".\n\nThere are many parallels between the \"Book of the Keys of the Work\" and \"The Book of Pictures“ in terms of subject and style: Both books are written \"to my lady\" and mainly \"in dialogue form, [... have] the same emphasis on the fact that there is just one alchemical operation [...], the alchemical work is one and emphasises the same central role for Democritus, 'the head of the sages of his time' [...]. The operation in both books centres on a composition of vapours [...]. It has the same essential feature of extracting the subtle with 'gentleness' [...] from all four natures, the mixture of like with like, and the need to bind the fugitive spirit. They have analogies in common, for example that of copper with the human being.\nAs in the \"Book of Pictures\", one can trace motives and symbols of Zosimos' teachings that go back to the worldview of pharaonic Egypt. Integrating these motives allows a better understanding of the text.\n\n\nThe complete (as of 1888) \"Œuvres de Zosime\" were published in French by M. Berthelot in \"Les alchimistes grecs\". English translations remain elusive; English translations of the Arabic \"The Book of the Keys of the Work\" (\"Kitāb Mafātīḥ aṣ-ṣan'a\") and \"The Book of Pictures\" (\"Muṣḥaf aṣ-ṣuwar\") have been published by Th. Abt and W. Madelung.\n\n"}

O'Carroll is a former chairman of the now disbanded Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) and was at one time a prominent member of the International Paedophile and Child Emancipation (now known as Ipce).\n\nO'Carroll grew up in Coventry, attending Whitmore Park Primary School and Woodlands school. in 1967 he graduated from Lancaster University with a degree in history. He worked as a teacher at Henry Parkes Primary School and Caludon Castle School in the 1970s.\n\nO'Carroll was working as a press officer for the Open University in the 1970s when he was told of the existence of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) after admitting he was a paedophile to lesbian members of the OU Women's Group. At that time, he was editor of the OU staff newspaper \"Open House\" and had been covering a Women's Group meeting on homosexuality. In his book \"Paedophilia: The Radical Case\", he writes: \"The general public in the UK has long been aware of 'child-molesting' and 'perversion'. But only in the 1970s did it come to hear about 'paedophilia', a designation suddenly lifted from the obscurity of medical textbooks to become a crusading badge of identity for those whom the term had been designed to oppress\".\n\nHis activism with PIE cost him his job at the OU, and he was dismissed in February 1978. O'Carroll appealed to an industrial tribunal which ruled in May 1979 rejecting his complaint as he had placed himself in a position which meant that he could not do his job effectively because of his connection to PIE.\n\nAt the time O'Carroll sat on the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) sub-committee for gay rights. However, NCCL's association with PIE was controversial internally. The Winter 1978 issue of \"Gay Left\" magazine reported that the NCCL executive had voted not to distribute a transcript of O'Carroll's speech to the organisation's 1977 conference in which he had objected to the punishment of sex offenders.\n\nAlthough PIE had campaigned for the age of consent to be lowered to 4 years old, O'Carroll stated that his personal view is that full sexual relations should be allowed at 12.\n\nO'Carroll's book \"\" was published in 1980. \"I am not interested in \"why\" I am a paedophile\", he writes \"any more than others are interested in \"why\" they are 'normal'.\" He advocates the normalisation of adult-child sexual relationships, and details his own illicit experiences.\n\nO'Carroll asserts his belief that each stage of the sexual relationship between an adult and child can be \"negotiated\", with \"hints and signals, verbal and non-verbal, by which each indicates to the other what is acceptable and what is not... the man might start by saying what pretty knickers the girl was wearing, and he would be far more likely to proceed to the next stage of negotiation if she seemed pleased by the remark\". Mary-Kay Wilmers in the \"London Review of Books\" wrote: \"Since Mr O’Carroll sees nothing wrong with paedophilia, he isn’t interested in our sympathy; and since his opinion of the non-paedophile world is no higher than the opinion the non-paedophile world has of him, he doesn’t waste time trying to be conciliatory\".\n\nThe book received mainstream reviews which were either scathingly dismissive, like Wilmers, or sympathetic.\n\nIn 1981, O'Carroll was convicted for conspiracy to corrupt public morals over the contact ads section of the PIE magazine and was imprisoned for two years. A barrister in the case, Peter Thornton, later a QC and senior circuit judge, wrote about it the following year in \"Rights\", the newsletter of the National Council for Civil Liberties (later Liberty). Thornton was critical of the charges, which he said had been \"too remote from any tangible misdemeanour\" and he suggested that O'Carroll had been convicted on little evidence.\n\nIn August 2002, O'Carroll was convicted at Southwark Crown Court of importing indecent photographs of children from Qatar, which had been found by Customs in October 2001 hidden in his luggage after his arrival at Heathrow Airport. In his packing cases, 94 full-frontal images of naked children aged between 2 and 10 were discovered, apparently taken without their consent or, the judge assumed, without that of their parents. According to O'Carroll, they were equivalent to an art exhibition.\n\nO'Carroll was sentenced to nine-months imprisonment on three counts. The conviction was later overturned in November 2002 by the Court of Appeal which held that the trial judge had been overly influenced by O'Carroll's campaigning. The photos were described in the ruling as having \"the quality of indecency in the context in which they were taken, but were of the kind that parents might take of their children entirely innocently\". O'Carroll's name was no longer required to be added to the Sex Offenders register.\n\nIn 2003, he made an extended appearance on the TV discussion programme \"After Dark\" in a BBC revival of the series, featuring Esther Rantzen and Helena Kennedy, among others.\n\nO'Carroll was convicted in 2006 of conspiring to distribute indecent photographs of children after supplying an undercover Metropolitan Police officer with a cache of child pornography obtained from his co-defendant Michael Studdert's secret vault containing 50,000 pornographic images. O'Carroll said the images with which he was connected had been in his possession for a \"very long time\". A new group O'Carroll was involved in running, International Paedophile Child Emancipation Group, and an offshoot, Gentlemen With An Interesting Name had been infiltrated by an undercover police officer. According to the police, O'Carroll considered the groups as an attempt at creating an \"international secret society\" of \"academic\" child abusers.\n\nO'Carroll was arraigned on 1 June 2006 on child pornography charges. In September 2006, he admitted to two counts of distributing indecent images of children between 1994 and July 2005. On 20 December 2006, he was jailed for 2½ years at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court. O'Carroll was placed on the sex offenders register for ten years and would be prevented from working with children in future.\n\nAfter a gestation of many years, O'Carroll's book on singer Michael Jackson was published in 2010 under the pen name Carl Toms. The book, \"Michael Jackson's Dangerous Liaisons\", concerns the entertainer's alleged intimate relationships with young boys. It was published in the UK by Troubador.\n\nAfter publication, J. Michael Bailey, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, reviewed the book for the academic journal \"Archives of Sexual Behavior\". Describing the author as \"an unapologetic pedophile\", Bailey observed that the book takes \"a pro-pedophilic stance\" and argues \"persuasively\" that Jackson was \"almost certainly pedophilic\". Bailey wrote, \"The idea that pedophilic relationships can be harmless or even beneficial to children is disturbing to many people, including me.\" But, he continued, \"O’Carroll argues against my intuitions and he argues well.\"\n\nIn 2010, O'Carroll's writing was affected following complaints to Amazon.com about a book by another author, Phillip R. Greaves, which encouraged sexual contact between adults and children. After a campaign by outraged Amazon readers, Amazon dropped the book, along with several other books that appeared to promote paedophilia, including O'Carroll's earlier book, \"Paedophilia: The Radical Case\".\n\nIn 2019, an independent documentary, \"\" was released detailing connections with the 1993 allegations brought by Evan Chandler with an attendee of the 1986 NAMBLA conference, in which members were suggesting that if Jackson was perceived to be a paedophile, their movement would be better received by the general public.\n\nO'Carroll joined the Labour Party after Jeremy Corbyn became party leader in September 2015. When this became public knowledge on 16 February 2016, via a report in \"The Times\", John Mann, the Labour Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw, and other party figures advocated his immediate expulsion. A Labour Party spokesman told ITV News a few hours later that O'Carroll had been suspended on the basis that he is a \"safeguarding risk\". The next day, the party confirmed that O'Carroll had been expelled.\n"}

Set in a Melbourne mental hospital in 1971, \"Così\" is semi-autobiographical, and is the sequel to his previous semi-autobiographical play, \"Summer of the Aliens\".\n\nThe play was adapted into the 1996 film \"Cosi\".\n\nSet several years after the events of \"Summer of the Aliens\", Lewis is now in a strained relationship with a bossy woman named Lucy, and in a friendship with political extremist, Nick. Lewis is always desperate for work as he states \"I need the money\". The venue is a theatre that smells of \"burnt wood and mould\", the cast are patients with very diverse needs, and the play is Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\". Through working with the patients, Lewis eventually discovers a new side of himself which allows him to become emotionally involved and to value love, while anti-Vietnam war protests erupt in the streets outside.\n\nThe patients make up a wide spectrum including Roy, a manic-depressive with a passion for theatre; Cherry, who has a food obsession and is a Lewis-addicted romantic; Ruth, suffering from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and is shown as obsessed with counting and distinguishing between illusions and reality; Doug, a pyromaniac, who loves sexual innuendo; Julie, dependent on drugs in the outside world; Henry, an older, silent man, previously a lawyer; and Zac, a drugged-up pianist.\n\nOther characters include Justin, a social worker at the mental institution; Lewis's girlfriend Lucy and his best mate Nick, whose strongly left-wing ideals Lewis has followed up until now without question. Meeting patients with views different from Lucy's and Nick's opens Lewis' eyes to other people and the world around him, teaching him to be more tolerant.\n\n\"Così\" was performed at La Boite Theatre in February, 2003. The play debuted in Asia in 2009, performed in The Hong Kong Fringe Club and directed by Wendy Herbert. It received its UK premiere in 1999 at the New End Theatre in London, starring Isla Fisher in her only stage appearance to date. It was performed at the White Bear Theatre in Kennington, London, starring Australian actor Mark Little as the manic-depressive Roy and Matthew Burton as the young theatre director, Lewis; it was directed by Adam Spreadbury-Maher for a 4-week season in August 2008. In 2011, the play was performed at the King's Head Theatre in Islington, London, directed by Adam Spreadbury-Maher. In 2012, the play was performed at Urban Stages in New York City, directed by Jesse Michael Mothershed and produced by Australian Made Entertainment. In February 2014, the play was given a major Australian revival by La Boite Theatre Company directed by longtime Louis Nowra collaborator David Berthold. Melbourne based theatre company MTC revived it again in a production directed by Sarah Goodes in May 2019.\n"}

It was established in 1984 by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and was located at the ESO headquarters in Garching bei München, Germany. The ST-ECF ceased operations on 31 December 2010.\n\nThe ST-ECF provided detailed technical information about the HST and its science instruments, supported European astronomers who were preparing HST observing proposals and coordinated the development of computer software tuned to the specific data analysis needs of HST users. In all these duties the ST-ECF staff maintained close contacts with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, which is charged with the scientific operation of the HST observatory.\n\nThe ST-ECF was last headed by Robert (Bob) Fosbury. Deputy was Jeremy Walsh.\n\nFounded before the era of the internet and widely available computer resources the ST-ECF was founded with user support for European astronomers as the main goal.\nWhen internet connections across the Atlantic and powerful computers became the mainstay, the focus of the organization shifted towards data product and dedicated instrument science support.\n\nThe ST-ECF was actively engaged in software development in many areas related to HST data calibration, analysis and visualisation for especially the Hubble instruments Faint Object Spectrograph, STIS, and Advanced Camera for Surveys. For example:\n\n\nTogether with the European Southern Observatory (ESO)\nthe ST-ECF operated and maintained the ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility from where all the scientific data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope could be accessed by the public.\nIn collaboration with the HST archives at the STScI and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) data products and access methods were continuously improved to assure the best possible science data for astronomers around the world. This includes work on the Virtual Observatory, On-The-Fly Calibration, and B Associations. Earlier work pioneered projects like Astrovirtel and Astrophysical Virtual Observatory.\n\nAfter the closure of ST-ECF the European HST Archive were moved to ESA's European Space Astronomy Centre in Spain, where most of ESA's Space Science Archives are located and operated from.\n\nOne of the groups at the ST-ECF was the Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre (HEIC), which, since 1999, has been the leading Hubble outreach activities group in Europe (headed by the science communication specialist Lars Lindberg Christensen and graphic designer Martin Kornmesser). HEIC's mission statement is to fulfill the Hubble Space Telescope outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency.\n\nHEIC became a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. After the closure of ST-ECF the Outreach component continued on an ESO contract for ESA, as part of ESO's Education and Public Outreach department.\n\nThe ESA/Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material – press releases, images, brochures, web pages, books etc. – suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provided a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.\n\nThe work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of European Space Agency’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.\n\nAll publicised material can be found on spacetelescope.org. The group is home to the FITS Liberator project and the \"Hubble – 15 Years of Discovery\" project that also led to the book Hubble - 15 Years of Discovery.\n\n"}

{"id": "2099115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099115", "title": "Gap wedge", "text": "Gap wedge\n\nIn golf, a gap wedge, also known as an approach wedge, is a wedge used to hit a shot with higher and shorter trajectory than a pitching wedge and lower and longer trajectory than a sand wedge. The name derives from the club's design to fill the \"gap\" between sand and pitching wedges.\n\nOver time the loft angle on irons in matched sets has been reduced for multiple reasons. Manufacturers, always wanting to advertise longer distances than their competitors, sometimes \"cheat\" by de-lofting their iron sets by a degree or two compared to their competitor's set, producing between 2-5 yards of extra distance per degree of \"strengthening\". In addition, several significant advances in clubhead design, most notably the 1970s development of investment-cast \"cavity-back\" designs, and the 1990s introduction of clubfaces that increased backspin to improve \"bite\", resulted in clubs with higher launch angles and flight paths for the same loft angle than their predecessors. Clubmakers then compensated for this in both cases by reducing loft, to translate that higher flight path into greater distance. Currently, the pitching wedge of a typical matched iron set has a loft similar to a 9-iron from the 1980s, at about 46 degrees, and much stronger lofts are found in game improvement sets.\n\nHowever, sand wedges generally have not received this same reduction in loft, even as they were designed with similar weight-distribution and backspin-improving features. This is because the sand wedge is typically not used with distance in mind; its eponymous purpose requires the traditional 54-56° loft angle in order to dig into the soft sand surrounding the ball and lift it out. The sand wedge's nominal loft and \"bounce\" angles have not changed appreciably from Gene Sarazen's original concept based on the niblick. Cavity-backed, perimeter-weighted sets may de-loft this club by a degree or two compared to a forged set, but this is nowhere near the amount of loft reduction seen in the numbered irons. This leaves a \"gap\" in loft angle between the pitching and sand wedges of up to 10 degrees, causing a distance difference with a full swing of up to 30 yards, both of which are differences normally seen between irons two or more loft numbers apart (e.g., between a 7 and 9 iron) instead of \"adjacent\" lofts as the PW and SW traditionally are.\n\nAs a result, some players who had upgraded to these newer de-lofted iron sets began carrying the pitching wedge of an older set, lofted around 50-52°, to \"fill the gap\". This additional wedge, with a full swing, falls between the average distances of a sand and pitching wedge, allowing the player to fine-tune their approach shot's distance without needing excessive variations in swing speed. Clubmakers, sensing an opportunity, began to offer a purpose-built wedge in this general loft range starting in the early to middle 1990s. These have become known colloquially as \"gap wedges\" due to their origin, despite various proprietary names applied to wedges in this class by their manufacturers.\n\nGap wedges are loosely defined, but typically have the loft between that of a pitching wedge and sand wedge, between 50 and 54 degrees. At the extremes there is redundancy with either the pitching wedge (typically 48°) or the sand wedge (typically 56°), however some players will \"fine-tune\" the lofts of these other wedges to their play style, leading to alternate loft choices for a gap wedge. Most players look for a separation of 4 degrees between clubs, and so with the standard pitching and sand wedge lofts, the complementary gap wedge would be 52°.\n\nWithin the range of lofts seen in gap wedges, the angle that the sole makes to the ground at address, also known as the club's \"bounce angle\", varies from 0° up to 12° or more. Lower lofts typically benefit from a lower bounce angle, suiting their use as effectively an \"11-iron\" for shots from firmer lies such as grass. Higher lofts, generally used from softer lies where the ball may have dug itself in more, require a higher bounce similar to the sand wedge to dig in and then lift back out of the ground. The most common 52° wedge is sold in a wide range of bounce angles; 8° is a common \"medium bounce\" choice, allowing the golfer to use the club in a variety of lies, from the fairway or rough to \"fried egg\" semi-embedded sand or mud situations.\n\nThe relation between actual loft and bounce can change based on how the player addresses the ball; the more forward the ball, and the more open the clubface, the higher the effective loft and bounce angles. Some clubmakers will vary the amount of bounce that the sole has from toe to heel, allowing the player to fine-tune the club to the specific situation by opening it. When square at address, such a club behaves more like a lower-bounce pitching wedge, while when opened, the club behaves more like a sand wedge (without the bounce becoming too high and making a \"skulled\" shot more likely, as it would with a constant bounce angle from tow to heel). A few manufacturers call attention to this by labeling the wedge \"D\" for \"dual wedge\", indicating it can be used as either a pitching or sand wedge (or anything in between).\n\nThere is little consistency in labeling gap wedges; most manufacturers simply label the wedge with its angle, optionally including additional information about the amount of bounce (sometimes the angle measure, more often a series of one to three dots indicating \"low\", \"medium\" and \"high\" bounce). Some manufacturers call it an \"Approach\", \"Attack\" or \"All\" wedge, labeling it in these cases with \"A\". The Karsten Manufacturing Company, maker of the Ping brand of golf clubs, favored the use of \"U\" for \"utility wedge\", but currently only uses this label on wedges sold in matched sets; most individual Ping wedges are currently labelled with their angle. It is actually uncommon to find a gap wedge labeled \"G\"; Adams Golf, Cobra, Mizuno, and Wilson are among the few manufacturers that do so.\n\nThe necessity of the gap wedge is contested by some golfers and clubfitters, who assert that this additional wedge would not be necessary if clubmakers had not de-lofted the clubs in the first place as a marketing move, to attract amateurs looking for more distance from each number. In addition, many matched sets do not include a gap wedge, when most clubmakers have included the pitching wedge since irons first began to be offered as matched numbered sets in the 1930s. The end result, critics claim, is that the 3 and 4-iron of a matched set have become just as hard to hit as the 1 and 2-irons of the 1970s, and with the average golfer carrying a set numbered between 4-iron and gap wedge, clubmakers might as well simply reduce all their labelled loft numbers by one, making the pitching wedge a 9-iron and the gap wedge a pitching wedge. Instead, most clubmakers continue to include the 3-iron and exclude the gap wedge from matched sets, which forces golfers to buy a 3-iron they are extremely unlikely to ever use, while not getting the much more important gap wedge and so having to buy it individually.\n\nFor their part, clubmakers contest that the modern golfer demands customization; wedges (including gap wedges) are available in many combinations of loft and bounce angle, allowing the player to choose exactly the combination they find most useful. Including a 52-degree mid-bounce wedge in a matched set may prove useless to a golfer who prefers a different loft or bounce than this standard offering. They also contend that, adjusting for inflation ($1.00 in 1970 would have the same buying power as $6.13 in 2014), the price of a matched iron set has decreased over this time period, even as design and manufacturing advances have genuinely increased the distance and accuracy that the average golfer can expect, compared to a club of an older design but similar launch angle. They also assert that these design advances have made the modern long irons easier to hit well than older generations, so golfers should at least try these long irons before removing them from the bag. Lastly, some manufacturers do in fact include a gap wedge as part of a matched iron set, often removing the 3 iron to provide the same overall number of clubs in the set (and in response to the concern about including such a difficult-to-use club). Ping, for instance, offers its G-series iron sets in two loft ranges, 3-PW and 4-UW.\n"}

His father, Paul, a railway worker and musician of Alsatian descent, introduced his two sons to various forms of music, while his mother, Renée, of Belgian descent, raised them both.\n\nHigelin's entertainment career began at age 14, when he left school to work as a stunt double. While playing a number of minor roles in motion pictures, Higelin was taught to play the guitar by Henri Crolla, a French-Italian jazz guitarist and a composer of film scores. By the early 1960s, Higelin was attending the René Simon drama school, where he won the François Perier award.\n\nFor two years beginning in 1961, Higelin served in the French military in various countries. Upon returning to France, he resumed his film career but increasingly began to focus on music. By the end of the decade, he had become very active in the artistic underground in Paris and began to channel his music towards radical activism.\n\nHigelin began attracting popular attention through his live concerts, typically held in smaller venues, and released his first solo album in 1971. By the middle of the 1970s, Higelin had become one of France's most successful pop musicians, and he remains influential to this day.\n\nIn the 70's Higelin was in a relationship with a French-Vietnamese woman called Kuelan Nguyen.

Iggy Pop became infatuated with Nguyen, who rejected him, but the incident inspired the song China Girl (song), which later became a hit when re-recorded by David Bowie.\n\nHigelin had three children, all of whom became artists:\n\nHigelin died on 6 April 2018 in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 97 men and three women (\"the doyenne of English women's cricket, Netta Rheinberg, the Pakistani journalist Fareshteh Gati and the Barbadian commentator Donna Symmonds\") on the panel were each given five votes with which to select the list.

The editor of \"Wisden\" at the time, Matthew Engel, wrote that the only real deficiency of the list was the absence of a fast bowler in the top five places. Fast bowlers dominated cricket from the 1970s until at least the mid-1990s, and the most famous pre-war test series, Bodyline, aroused controversy because of England's fast bowling strategy designed to counter Bradman. The Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee was joint sixth in the overall list, selected by 19 of the panellists. The only specialist bowler in the top five is Shane Warne, who was a leg spinner. Warne was the only one of the five still playing when the list was published, and the only one not to be knighted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099143", "title": "The Green Green Grass", "text": "The Green Green Grass\n\nThe Green Green Grass is a BBC television sitcom, created and initially written by John Sullivan, produced by Shazam Productions for the BBC. It is a sequel/spin-off of the long running sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\" and stars John Challis, Sue Holderness and Jack Doolan. Four series and three Christmas specials were originally broadcast on BBC One between 2005 and 2009.\n\nThe series follows three characters from \"Only Fools and Horses\"; Boycie (John Challis), his wife Marlene (Sue Holderness) and their teenage son Tyler. In the first episode, they are forced to move from Peckham to escape the Driscoll brothers. They decide to set up home on a farm in rural Shropshire.\n\nBoycie (played by John Challis) is forced to flee Peckham after providing crucial evidence against the infamous Driscoll brothers regarding illegal immigrants and drug smuggling, resulting in the Driscolls' imprisonment. He is the lead witness in the case and finds himself in trouble when every single other witness changes their statement and the Driscoll brothers walk free. In an attempt to live to old age, Boycie and his wife, Marlene (Sue Holderness) and son Tyler (Jack Doolan) move overnight to the secluded town of Oakam, Shropshire, along with their pet Rottweiler, Earl. Upon arrival at Winterdown Farm, Boycie begins to realise that confronting the violent Driscolls, was maybe the easier option.\nThe situation focuses primarily on their futile attempts to run the farm efficiently through utilising the current staff consisting of Elgin Sparrowhawk (David Ross), Bryan (Ivan Kaye), Jed (Peter Heppelthwaite) and Imelda Cakeworthy (Ella Kenion) – the farm's loyal, if a little eccentric staff. As the series progressed, Boycie and Marlene began to settle into their surroundings however, situations arose occasionally – usually involving their Welsh neighbour, Llewellyn. Tyler was soon sent to school to finish his GCSEs, something he really did not want to do but again problems arose as Tyler fell in love with his English teacher.\n\nThe snob in Boycie is often his downfall, as he found out when he attended the Agricultural Ball in 2005, where his photo was taken and published in a magazine that stated where he would be that Christmas. However, luck ensured that Boycie remained at home when he was snowed in and missed his plane, thus not getting scammed by con artists and not getting killed by the Driscoll brothers, who had travelled to meet him.\n\nAs the series progressed further, Boycie started to use artificial fertiliser on his organic farm, applied to be mayor, fired Mrs Cakeworthy, only to rehire her and, to Marlene's disgust, became infatuated with Tyler's promiscuous French exchange. He also ended up naked in front of Tyler's girlfriend through a massage gone awry, and took part in a pub quiz, in which a £10,000 bet with Llewellyn – of his own money – was up for grabs.\n\nIn 2006, a whole year after they escaped, Boycie allowed Marlene to invite her sister Petunia up to stay; she was, however, followed by the Driscoll brothers, without anyone knowing. They attacked the farm's staff and tied them up in the barn (including Boycie's Rottweiler, Earl). When Boycie realised something was wrong he went to investigate the barn only to come face to face with two sawn-off shotguns.\n\nFollowing the Driscoll brothers' visit, life on Winterdown Farm is calm. Marlene, Tyler and Boycie have settled down and are beginning to enjoy village life. However, they cannot return to Peckham due to a deal between the Driscoll brothers and Boycie – he would allow them to bury a secret item (later revealed to be 5 million Spanish pesetas in cash) on his land and he must protect it. The events of 2006 still had repercussions in 2007, even though Farm Idol was accepting auditions and Earl was missing in the woods. Also, Boycie began to worry about his health after finding out about a genetic similarity between him and past generations (but still worrying about it after finding out that his biological father was a captured Nazi-German pilot). A death was about to hit the farm hard though, Brian's pet turkey, Paxo.\n\nThe departure of Lisa Diveney as Beth was then filled with the arrival of Samantha Sutherland, who played Sara, Tyler's new girlfriend. Boycie fell in fear of the Driscoll brothers once more when they turned up at The Grange and machine gunned his front door down when he refused to answer it. Also, paranormal experts investigate the house, Boycie decides to take some old items to the \"Antiques Roadshow\" and Boycie and Marlene decide to renew their vows for their fortieth wedding anniversary, but realise they might not be legally married at all.\n\nThe humour comes from several sources. The interaction between characters is essential and much is made of the character's individual traits, such as Boycie's snobbery, Elgin's façade of stupidity, Bryan and Jed's general daftness, Imelda's non-cleaning habits and Llewellyn's constant underhand moves. There are also several running gags, including Boycie's attempts to be a gentleman farmer and his yearning for respect which he never gets, Boycie's fear of the Driscoll brothers and Marlene's supposed long-time affair with a now-unseen Del Boy, and the fact that Tyler is hinted to be Del's son.\n\nWriter John Sullivan had the idea for a spin-off to the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\" in 1997; its commission was announced in 2003 and the premise for the series was established in the final \"Only Fools and Horses\" episode \"Sleepless in Peckham\" in 2003. The prequel was shelved and spin-off \"The Green Green Grass\" was then developed to follow secondary characters, Boycie, Marlene and their son Tyler as they escape the Driscoll brothers and attempt to live in the countryside of Shropshire.\n\n\"The Green Green Grass\" was announced in June 2005, written by Sullivan and made by his production company Shazam Productions, its first series.\n\nThe series notably expanded on the characters, giving them greater depth and, particularly in the case of Boycie, more warmth and humanity than previously displayed in the parent series. The series introduced many new characters played by actors who are relatively unknown. Characters from \"Only Fools and Horses\" did not pass over to the spin-off, though there were four exceptions to this. The first was Denzil (Paul Barber), who appeared in the début episode. The Driscoll brothers have made three appearances since the show's debut. Sid (Roy Heather) made a brief cameo appearance in the 2005 special. Boycie has also made many veiled references to Del, Rodney and Uncle Albert. John Sullivan made it clear from the beginning that no characters from \"Only Fools and Horses\" would make an appearance, as if one character appears then viewers would expect the rest to follow, damaging the programme's ability to stand alone.\n\nHe indicated in February 2007, to the \"Only Fools and Horses Appreciation Society\" that \"some old faces may appear over the next couple of series\". The prequel to \"Only Fools and Horses\", \"Rock & Chips\" was announced in July 2009.\n\nThe main writer of \"The Green Green Grass\" is John Sullivan. He wrote all six episodes of the first series and the extended length special, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock\" in 2005. He also wrote the episode \"Here's to You, Mrs Boyce\" in series two and co-wrote another three episodes of the second series as well as the 2006 Christmas special. He co-wrote the episode \"Sweet Sorrow\" for the third series and the 2007 Christmas special with Keith Lindsay. Sullivan has written three of the episodes in series four.\n\nJim Sullivan, John Sullivan's son, wrote two episodes for series two and three episodes for series three. He also wrote two episodes for the fourth series. Derren Litten wrote the episodes \"Bothered and Bewildered\" and \"Brothers and Sisters\" in series two. He has not since written for \"The Green Green Grass\". For the second series, James Windett wrote \"Schoolboy French\" and Paul Alexander wrote the episode \"More Questions Than Answers\".\n\nDavid Cantor has written for both the third and fourth series. He wrote three episodes of the third series and the episode \"Calendar Boys\" for the fourth. Meanwhile, Keith Lindsay co-wrote both the episode \"Sweet Sorrow\" and \"The Special Relationship\" for the third series/special. He also co-wrote the episode \"Home Brew\" and wrote the episode \"The Departed\" for the fourth series.\n\nMost episodes are filmed in front of a live audience at Teddington Studios (the 2005 special was recorded at Pinewood Studios). There are three major sets; The Pub, Boycie's Front Room and Boycie's Kitchen. Other sets are irregularly used. Outdoor shots are constantly used for footage of on and around the farm. Footage of the local village is often used. Location shooting of Boyce's farm is recorded at John Challis' own home near Leintwardine, on the Herefordshire/Shropshire border, and the surrounding area.\n\nIt is also the first multi-camera British television series to be shot in high definition.\n\nThe pilot for the series was recorded on 24 November 2004 at Teddington Studios. The remainder of the series was shot over June–August 2005. A Christmas special was also filmed. The second series and 2006 special were filmed over the summer months of 2006 and the third series was filmed during the summer of 2007. The fourth series was filmed during the summer months of 2008 however the series did not begin to air until 8 January 2009.\n\nSullivan wrote the theme music for \"The Green Green Grass\" when he wrote the first series. He wrote the lyrics to explain the title and why Boycie and his family were running away to the countryside. Music for most sitcoms, such as \"Last of the Summer Wine\" have remained instrumental. However, John Sullivan wanted a theme tune that explained the obscure title (as with Only Fools and Horses) and reasons for the characters' sudden dash.\n\nThe song is performed by John Sullivan. There were rumours at one point that Status Quo would be involved in the theme tune, but this was dismissed after the first episode aired. Status Quo performed the end credits for series four episode, \"Animal Instincts\". They perform in a charity concert set up by Tyler, but they are not seen. The theme tune does not feature in the concert.\n\nThe opening credits see the title, \"The Green Green Grass by John Sullivan\", appear on screen. However, from series two onwards, the on-screen credit states that the show is \"created by John Sullivan\". The only other text to appear during the opening credits is the name of the individual episodes such as \"Keep on Running\". Opening credits have never featured cast names. The show was always broadcast in the 16:9 ratio widescreen.\n\nThe closing credits for the programme varied episode by episode. Most of the first series episodes featured the standard rolling format. However, some episodes featured a scrolling bar across the bottom of the screen. The series' end credits used a full-length version of the opening theme tune as the credits appear on screen. The end credits occasionally appeared over continuing footage (\"Home Brew\"), or a slideshow of photographs (\"For Richer For Poorer\") or a shot of a river, forest or part of Winterdown Farm.\n\nBoycie (John Challis) – A dubious former-used car salesman turned gentleman farmer. He is a frightful snob and looks down at most of the people in Oakham. Boycie made sporadic appearances in \"Only Fools and Horses\" before becoming the central character in \"The Green Green Grass\". Boycie used to be a Freemason. He is very self-centred and arrogant and likes to boast about his social status back in Peckham and his money. He used to be teased by Del Boy due to his low sperm count. This is a joke that has continued into the spin-off series, along with the ongoing joke referring to an unseen affair between Marlene and Del. He was forced to leave Peckham after testifying against the Driscoll Brothers in court.\n\nMarlene (Sue Holderness) – Marlene was initially just an unseen character in \"Only Fools and Horses\". She is a cheerful, slightly daft, optimistic person who is speculated to have had an ongoing affair with Del which resulted in the birth of Tyler. The ongoing joke continued into \"The Green Green Grass\", as Jack Doolan, who plays Tyler, has looks similar to David Jason. The character has been expanded massively for the spin-off series but is still the same loving wife who Boycie married in 1968.\n\nTyler (Jack Doolan) –The character of Tyler made several appearances in \"Only Fools and Horses\", although he was portrayed by different actors. His similarity in appearance to Del Boy has led to a continuation of a running gag dating back to the late 1980s. It has been speculated in both \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"The Green Green Grass\" that Tyler might be the outcome of a fling between Marlene and Del. One of his appearances in \"Only Fools and Horses\" was in the episode \"The Jolly Boys’ Outing\", in which Uncle Albert told him one of his many war stories. Tyler made other appearances in the show (the last having been as a toddler in the 1991 'Miami Twice' double-bill), but was not featured heavily until the beginning of \"The Green Green Grass\". His introduction in the spin-off hyped the speculation that Tyler might have been a result of something between Marlene and Del.\n\nElgin (David Ross) – Elgin Sparrowhawk is the farm manager of Winterdown Farm. He is a rather strange man, who likes to appear a bit thick to ensure his workload remains light, but likes to show people that he is capable of outsmarting Boycie any day. He always carries his briefcase with a string shoulder strap around with him, to help remind people that he is still farm manager, even though it looks empty on occasions. His wife is unseen, but apparently has a glass eye. He has said on occasions that she dislikes him, and at one point he started to have his mail redirected to Boycie's house just to ensure that she does not find out that he is still living there. He has shown deep affection towards his wife on many occasions, although he obviously fancies Marlene. Whenever she has her back turned, he is copping an eyeful; on one occasion he went as far as to dive across to kitchen floor in an attempt to woo an unsuspecting Marlene.\n\nBryan (Ivan Kaye) – Bryan is the farm's herdsman. He again likes to appear a bit thick so that he can take advantage of Boycie's ignorance. He has, on occasions, reduced his workload by bluffing to an out-of-his-depth Boycie. Bryan can be a little over the top on occasions, especially when thinking about his ex-girlfriend Myrtle. In one particular episode, he states that she chucked him seven times, and every time he found exactly the same wedding ring in a second-hand shop. It is sometimes hard to believe that Bryan's stupidity is a put-up job. Little else is known about the character besides the fact that he lives alone in a caravan on the edge of Winterdown Farm.\n\nJed (Peter Heppelthwaite) – Jed is the farm's ploughman. He again likes to think he's appearing a bit thick, but, in reality, viewers are led to believe that Jed is genetically thick. He is renowned for having a family of five children. He is often the brunt of a joke, whereby he and his wife are ‘too lazy’ to use contraception. Jed's workload has also been known to expand from ploughman to various other areas of expertise, such as in the episode \"Home Brew\" when he gets involved in Ye Potato Cyder business. He is also known for attempting to escape his wife, such as when he turns up unexpectedly in one particular episode, in the middle of the night, at Bryan's caravan after having a blazing row with his wife. Bryan just accepts this as a usual occurrence and lets him in.\n\nMrs Cakeworthy (Ella Kenion) – Mrs Cakeworthy is The Grange's housecleaner. Various jokes have been made to her expense, referring to her non-cleaning and biscuit-eating habits. She has even on occasions been asked to lift her legs whilst Marlene does the hoovering. Boycie sacks her in the episode \"Bothered and Bewildered\" after he catches her sitting around doing nothing. However, after some strange experiences he re-hires her. Mrs Cakeworthy has a husband who has been seen on occasions, most notably in the 2006 Christmas special \"From Here to Paternity\". She has also been seen to hold seances within the house. Mrs Cakeworthy is also said to have a dust intolerance.\n\nLlewellyn (Alan David) - Llewellyn is Boycie's next-door neighbour. Boycie continually refers to him as a mad Welshman. He has been known to look after himself and puts his thoughts before others. In one episode, he told the police about Boycie using Artificial Fertiliser on his Organic Farm. This could have put Boycie in prison for up to five years. Llewellyn has a daughter called Rhian, who is Tyler's English teacher. Rhian has appeared in two episodes.\n\nBeth (Lisa Diveney) – Beth is Tyler's girlfriend until the end of the third series. She is clever, attractive and vegetarian. Over the three years she spent as Tyler's girlfriend, she had her patience put to the test. First, Tyler showed no interest in supporting her horse racing protests, then he put meat before her, and, to top things off, she peers through the window to see Boycie completely naked, thanks to Earl, in \"Mother Earth\".\n\nSara (Samantha Sutherland) – Sara is Tyler's latest girlfriend. She is slightly weird in the sense that she is a fan of Tyler's band, Puddle of Agony. Tyler eventually asked her out in the episode \"Your Cheating Art\", after some help from his mum and Dora. Tyler even managed to get her to strip naked for a piece of artwork.\n\nRay (Nigel Harrison) – Ray is Beth's father and landlord of the local pub. Ray does not particularly like Tyler, as he believes that his daughter could have done better. He first appeared in the episode \"Testing Times\" and appeared in another ten episodes since. He is known to lash out in extreme circumstances, such as the misunderstanding in \"From Here to Paternity\" in which he punches Boycie.\n\nThe Driscoll Brothers (Roy Marsden & Christopher Ryan) – First seen in \"Little Problems\" in \"Only Fools and Horses\", the brothers cause Boycie to make a rushed dash to the countryside in an attempt to escape from them. They appeared in the 2005 Christmas Special, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock\" but they did not manage to catch him. They made their third ever appearance in \"Brothers and Sisters\" when they finally caught up with Boycie and made him a deal.\n\nDora (June Whitfield) – Dora is Marlene's mother. She is hated, as always in classic comedy, by Boycie, her son-in-law. She is reluctant to let him in her house and is always making uncalled-for comments towards him. He became more tolerant of her as the series progressed. In an \"Only Fools and Horses\" episode, Dora forbade Boycie to stay with her when his gas-effect log fire gases them out so he had to stay with Del Boy.\n\nGuest actors were brought into \"The Green Green Grass\" on an infrequent basis however, there were a few guests stars over the thirty-two episodes of the sitcom. The first guest star was in the very first episode, \"Keep on Running\" which saw Denzil (Paul Barber), an \"Only Fools and Horses\" regular, warn Boycie about the Driscoll Brothers’ release from prison and the fact that they know who grassed them up. Another character from the parent sitcom who made an appearance was Sid (Roy Heather), who made a cameo appearance, on the set of The Nag's Head, in the 2005 Christmas special.\n\nOccasionally guest actors were essential to the plot such as when Tyler fell in love with his school teacher, Rhian (Karen Paullada) and four con men tried to get Boycie to invest in a fictional polo club. This included appearances from Sara Crowe, Liz Robertson, Roger Alborough and Matthew Marsh in the special, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock\". Other guest stars, essential to the plot included the Farm Inspector (David Cann) in the episode \"Testing Times\", Simon (Ian Bonar) in \"Here's to You, Mrs Boyce\" and Laurence (Beatriz Romilly) in \"Schoolboy French\". Further guest appearances in the series included Paul Bown as Colin Cakeworthy, Lucy Briers as the Doctor, Fiona Bruce as herself in two separate episodes, Jeremy Clyde as Tristram and the Animal Protestors, as played by Danny Morgan and Tony Bignell. Also, Henry Sandon appeared as himself as did Nick Ross in series one. Stephen Evans appeared as the Vicar in \"For Richer For Poorer\".\n\nWell-known actors who appeared in the programme include Paula Wilcox who played Pertunia, Marlene's sister, in the episode \"Brothers and Sisters\", George Wendt who played Cliff Cooper, a rich American soldier revisiting old haunts, in the 2007 Christmas special, \"The Special Relationship\" and June Whitfield (details above) as Dora. All three well-known actors played important roles in their individual episodes, either as the person who led the Driscoll Brothers to Boycie, the father of one of Boycie's staff or as a pain-in-the-backside mother-in-law.\n\nThirty-two episodes of \"The Green Green Grass\", mostly written by John Sullivan, were broadcast on BBC1 between 9 September 2005 and 5 March 2009. The show aired in four series (2005–07; 2009) and also aired three Christmas special editions (2005–07). All of the regular series episodes had a running time of 30 minutes, and all subsequent specials had a running time ranging from 40 to 50 minutes. All the episodes were shot in front of a live audience, with an added laughter track.\n\nThe three extended length specials were aired at Christmas. The first, aired 2005, was 50 minutes in length and featured a guest appearance from The Driscoll Brothers (Roy Marsden and Christopher Ryan). The second special, aired 2006, was 45 minutes in length and featured only the main and recurring cast members. The third, aired 2007, was 40 minutes in length and featured a guest appearance from George Wendt\n\nThe first episode of \"The Green Green Grass\" attracted an average of 8.88 million viewers, giving the channel a 41.7% audience share. Viewership had slipped considerably by 2009 when the debut episode for the fourth series attracted 4.07 million viewers (16.5% share), with the series closing to 4.38 million (18.8% share).\n\nAll four series along with the 2005–7 specials have been repeated on Gold in the UK.\n\nThe complete series has been released on DVD, along with the three Christmas specials.\n\n"}

{"id": "2099179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099179", "title": "T-norm", "text": "T-norm\n\nIn mathematics, a t-norm (also T-norm or, unabbreviated, triangular norm) is a kind of binary operation used in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces and in multi-valued logic, specifically in fuzzy logic. A t-norm generalizes intersection in a lattice and conjunction in logic. The name \"triangular norm\" refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize triangle inequality of ordinary metric spaces.\n\nA t-norm is a function T: [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] which satisfies the following properties:\n\nSince a t-norm is a binary algebraic operation on the interval [0, 1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by formula_1.\n\nThe defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of the partially ordered Abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0, 1]. \" (Cf. ordered group.)\" The monoidal operation of any partially ordered Abelian monoid \"L\" is therefore by some authors called a \"triangular norm on L\".\n\nT-norms are a generalization of the usual two-valued logical conjunction, studied by classical logic, for fuzzy logics. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures that the degree of truth of conjunction does not decrease if the truth values of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as \"true\" (and consequently 0 as \"false\"). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.\n\nT-norms are also used to construct the intersection of fuzzy sets or as a basis for aggregation operators (see fuzzy set operations). In probabilistic metric spaces, t-norms are used to generalize triangle inequality of ordinary metric spaces. Individual t-norms may of course frequently occur in further disciplines of mathematics, since the class contains many familiar functions.\n\nA t-norm is called \"continuous\" if it is continuous as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0, 1]. (Similarly for \"left-\" and \"right-continuity\".)\n\nA t-norm is called \"strict\" if it is continuous and strictly monotone.\n\nA t-norm is called \"nilpotent\" if it is continuous and each \"x\" in the open interval (0, 1) is its nilpotent element, i.e., there is a natural number \"n\" such that \"x\" formula_1 ... formula_1 \"x\" (\"n\" times) equals 0.\n\nA t-norm formula_1 is called \"Archimedean\" if it has the Archimedean property, i.e., if for each \"x\", \"y\" in the open interval (0, 1) there is a natural number \"n\" such that \"x\" formula_1 ... formula_1 \"x\" (\"n\" times) is less than or equal to \"y\".\n\nThe usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, i.e.,\nAs functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called \"stronger\" than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of fuzzy logic, however, the larger a t-norm, the \"weaker\" (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents.\n\n\nThe drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and the minimum is the pointwise largest t-norm:\n\nFor every t-norm T, the number 0 acts as null element: T(\"a\", 0) = 0 for all \"a\" in [0, 1].\n\nA t-norm T has zero divisors if and only if it has nilpotent elements; each nilpotent element of T is also a zero divisor of T. The set of all nilpotent elements is an interval [0, \"a\"] or [0, \"a\"), for some \"a\" in [0, 1].\n\nAlthough real functions of two variables can be continuous in each variable without being continuous on [0, 1], this is not the case with t-norms: a t-norm T is continuous if and only if it is continuous in one variable, i.e., if and only if the functions \"f\"(\"x\") = T(\"x\", \"y\") are continuous for each \"y\" in [0, 1]. Analogous theorems hold for left- and right-continuity of a t-norm.\n\nA continuous t-norm is Archimedean if and only if 0 and 1 are its only idempotents.\n\nA continuous Archimedean t-norm is strict if 0 is its only nilpotent element; otherwise it is nilpotent. By definition, moreover, a continuous Archimedean t-norm T is nilpotent if and only if \"each\" \"x\" < 1 is a nilpotent element of T. Thus with a continuous Archimedean t-norm T, either all or none of the elements of (0, 1) are nilpotent. If it is the case that all elements in (0, 1) are nilpotent, then the t-norm is isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm; i.e., there is a strictly increasing function \"f\" such that\nIf on the other hand it is the case that there are no nilpotent elements of T, the t-norm is isomorphic to the product t-norm. In other words, all nilpotent t-norms are isomorphic, the Łukasiewicz t-norm being their prototypical representative; and all strict t-norms are isomorphic, with the product t-norm as their prototypical example. The Łukasiewicz t-norm is itself isomorphic to the product t-norm undercut at 0.25, i.e., to the function \"p\"(\"x\", \"y\") = max(0.25, \"x\" · \"y\") on [0.25, 1].\n\nFor each continuous t-norm, the set of its idempotents is a closed subset of [0, 1]. Its complement — the set of all elements which are not idempotent — is therefore a union of countably many non-overlapping open intervals. The restriction of the t-norm to any of these intervals (including its endpoints) is Archimedean, and thus isomorphic either to the Łukasiewicz t-norm or the product t-norm. For such \"x\", \"y\" that do not fall into the same open interval of non-idempotents, the t-norm evaluates to the minimum of \"x\" and \"y\". These conditions actually give a characterization of continuous t-norms, called the Mostert–Shields theorem, since every continuous t-norm can in this way be decomposed, and the described construction always yields a continuous t-norm. The theorem can also be formulated as follows:\n\nA similar characterization theorem for non-continuous t-norms is not known (not even for left-continuous ones), only some non-exhaustive methods for the construction of t-norms have been found.\n\nFor any left-continuous t-norm formula_14, there is a unique binary operation formula_17 on [0, 1] such that\nfor all \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" in [0, 1]. This operation is called the \"residuum\" of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum to a t-norm formula_14 is often denoted by formula_21 or by the letter R.\n\nThe interval [0, 1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a residuated lattice. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of adjunction (specifically, a Galois connection): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(\"x\", –) to the functor T(–, \"x\") for each \"x\" in the lattice [0, 1] taken as a poset category.\n\nIn the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called \"R-implication\").\n\nIf formula_17 is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm formula_14, then\nConsequently, for all \"x\", \"y\" in the unit interval,\nand\n\nIf formula_1 is a left-continuous t-norm and formula_17 its residuum, then\nIf formula_1 is continuous, then equality holds in the former.\n\nIf \"x\" ≤ \"y\", then R(\"x\", \"y\") = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for \"x\" > \"y\".\n\nT-conorms (also called S-norms) are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation which assigns 1 – \"x\" to \"x\" on [0, 1]. Given a t-norm formula_14, the complementary conorm is defined by\nThis generalizes De Morgan's laws.\n\nIt follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms:\n\nT-conorms are used to represent logical disjunction in fuzzy logic and union in fuzzy set theory.\n\nImportant t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms:\n\nMany properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example:\n\nFurther properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.:\n\nA negator formula_42 is a monotonous falling, i. e. order-reversion mapping with formula_43 and formula_44 (in other notation: formula_45 and formula_46). \nA negator n is called\nThe standard (canonical) negator is \nformula_49, \nwhich is both strict and strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows:\n\nA De Morgan Triplet is a triple (T,⊥,n) iff (if and only if)\n\n\n"}

'Colebi' and 'Nieweham', were separate medieval hamlets when identified in the Domesday Book of 1086, formerly covered this site. The agricultural legacy of the area, reminiscent indeed of that of the entire wider Middlesbrough area, is still touched on today by the working Newham Grange Leisure farm, itself harking as far back to life in this particular spot of rural North Yorkshire as the 17th century.\n\nOnly as the 1970s dawned, in the shadow of the rest of modern Middlesbrough's continual southerly urban expansion, did this change. Coulby Newham developed after the building of the A174 Parkway (after which the suburb's shopping Mall, the Parkway Shopping Centre, opened in 1986, was subsequently named).\n\nThe first major building in Coulby Newham was Coulby Newham Secondary School (replaced in 2003 by The King's Academy). Coulby Newham Secondary opened with Year 7-10 in the late 1970s, receiving many students that had been excluded from Acklam schools Hustler and Boynton. The school began with many young teachers and in its formative years was a successful school which was at the centre of the growing community of Coulby Newham.\n\nThere are now three primary schools; Sunnyside Primary School, Rose Wood Academy and St Augustine's RC School. The suburb also contains two churches, Coulby Newham Baptist Church and a Roman Catholic cathedral.\n\nCoulby Newham remains a rapidly developing suburb of Middlesbrough, Tesco choosing to locate a new £2m store in the area in 2005. There are many new private housing developments in the suburbs, making Coulby Newham spread in the direction of Great Ayton and other villages close to the hills.\n\nOther large chain stores developed in Coulby Newham include Pets at Home, Halfords, Boyes, Home Bargains, Burger King, McDonald's, KFC, Poundland, Greggs, Cooplands, Specsavers, Costa and Subway.\n\nIn July 2017, a series of arson attacks took place at Newham Hall Farm; a 12-year-old boy was found responsible for one of the blazes, and two other boys of the same age were interviewed in connection with the fires.\n"}

After spending two hours in orbit around the Earth, the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V was reignited to send them to the Moon.\n\nDuring the retrieval of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) from its stowed position below the command and service module (CSM), a light came on on the control panel that indicated the valves of the service propulsion system were open and the engine should be firing. A short was found in a switch that controlled the redundant valves for the engine. New procedures were developed to deal with this. During their first inspection of the LM, Scott and Irwin found that the glass cover of a tapemeter had broken forcing them to clean up the glass shards lest they breathe them in.\n\nOn the fourth day they entered into lunar orbit and prepared for lunar descent.\n\nThe crew were awakened at 4:19 am EST. After brief medical exams, they ate breakfast with the backup and support crews. They then put on their spacesuits and were taken by van to the launch site, where they arrived at 6:45 am. This was about 2½ hours before launch. During the launch phase of the flight, Scott sat in the left-hand seat of the CSM, Worden in the center seat, and Irwin in the right-hand seat.\n\nApollo 15 was launched at 9:34:00 am EST on July 26, 1971. One of the few problems encountered during the launch phase came at the separation of the first and second stages. Solid-fuel ullage rockets had been removed from the interstage between the first and second stages. These rockets were used to settle the fuel and oxidizer in the S-II. The first stage also carried only four retrorockets whereas previous missions had used eight. The first stage engines did not cutoff cleanly, taking over four seconds to drop from 2% thrust to zero. This meant that the S-IC was closer to the S-II than planned and the ignition of the second stage disabled the telemetry package on the first stage.\n\nEleven minutes and 34 seconds after launch the crew were in their Earth parking orbit 92.5 by 91.5 nm (171.3 by 169.5 km). An orbit of this height is not sustainable for very long due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere, but the crew would only spend three hours before reigniting the S-IVB third stage to put them on a lunar-bound trajectory. About 485 lb (220 kg) of liquid oxygen (LOX) was lost through an open vent of the S-IVB after the rocket was pitched down too quickly after cutoff.\n\nOne of the windows of the Apollo 15 CSM was specifically designed to transmit ultraviolet radiation, permitting the crew to acquire UV photographs of the Earth and the Moon. These photographs began as soon as they reached Earth orbit and would continue throughout the mission. During times when they were not using the window, Mission Control had them place a cover over the window that blocked the UV, in an effort to minimize their exposure.\n\nTwo hours, 50 minutes and 2.6 seconds after launch the S-IVB reignited and burned for 5 minutes and 49 seconds. The burn increased the spacecraft's speed from 25,620 feet per second (7,809 m/s) to 35,522 feet per second (10,827 m/s). The altitude had been raised to 167.4 nautical miles (310.0 km).\n\nThe next major task for the crew was transposition, docking, and extraction. The lunar module sat below the command and service module, head-to-tail. As such, it was required for the CSM to separate from the S-IVB, travel a short distance, turn 180 degrees and then dock with and extract the lunar module. First the CSM separated, taking ten minutes to turn, come back and hard dock. About half an hour later, after pressurizing the lunar module and checking the integrity of the docking latches, the crew extracted \"Falcon\" from the S-IVB. The S-IVB would be put on a trajectory so that it would impact the lunar surface at 3°39'S, 7°35'W.\n\nIt was sometime during the transposition and docking that the \"SPS Thrust\" light on the entry monitor system part of the control panel came on. The service propulsion system (SPS) was the rocket engine of the CSM and this particular light was used to indicate the valves in the engine were open and that the rocket should be firing, something that was not in fact happening. As a precaution the crew opened the circuit breakers that controlled the valves to stop them being opened by a short circuit and causing the engine to fire.\n\nAfter some period of troubleshooting it was determined that there was a short circuit in the \"Delta-V Thrust\" switch. This switch opened the valves in the SPS. With the cause being in the switch it meant that the engine itself was fine, but new procedures would have to be used when operating the engine to stop accidental ignition.\n\nOne of the reasons for the success of the Apollo program was the redundancy of critical systems—in the case of the SPS, there were two independent valve systems for the engine. The short in the switch only affected one of these sets of valves and as such it was still possible to fire the engine. But instead of having both sets of valves open at the start of each ignition, only the trouble-free valves would be used. For long burns, the valves affected by the short would be opened only after ten seconds, and closed before the end of the burn.\n\nMission Control decided to cancel the first midcourse correction (MCC-1). This would give them a chance to fire the SPS engine at the second planned correction. This cancellation meant that tasks that would have been done later could be brought forward and the crew could get to sleep sooner. These tasks included a water dump and putting the spacecraft into passive thermal control (PTC) or what was often called \"barbecue mode\", as the spacecraft was put into a slow roll so that there was even heat distribution. Nearly 15 hours after launch, the crew switched off the lights in the cabin and went to sleep.\n\nThe second day of Apollo 15 centered around the second planned midcourse correction and a preliminary check of the lunar module, \"Falcon\". Mission Control first got the crew to perform a 0.7 second burn of the SPS engine before the planned second course correction. This was designed to isolate the location of the short in the Delta-V Thrust switch. The burn allowed Mission Control to confirm that the SPS would only be ignited accidentally if the faulty switch was armed. It was found after the flight that a 0.06 inch (1.4 mm) length of wire had found its way into the switch, and had shorted it. The engine burn itself was good enough, adding 5.3 ft/s (1.62 m/s) to their speed, that Mission Control cancelled the planned second and third course corrections.\n\nAfter venting the atmosphere of the lunar module overboard (in case there was some contamination in the spacecraft), and then replenishing it from the CSM, the crew removed the hatch between \"Endeavour\" and \"Falcon\" and entered the LM. Scott and Irwin checked the switch settings in the LM to make sure none had changed since launch and also checked the electrical, environmental and communications systems. They found that a glass cover on one of the tapemeters had broken and that there was glass in the cabin. This did not impair the meter's use, but was of concern, as glass could be inhaled by the crew or get into the environmental systems. After replacing the hatch, the crew ate and went to bed to end their first full day in space.\n\nThe \"morning\" of the third day centered around an \"eye flash\" experiment. Some previous crews had experienced bright flashes even when they closed their eyes. Irwin reported that he had seen them during the two previous sleep periods. The experiment involves the crew facing in the same direction, wearing blindfolds and having placed shades over the windows. They described the position, color and time of the flashes. They spent an hour doing this. It is thought that the flashes were caused by Cherenkov radiation from high energy cosmic rays passing through the eyes.\n\nThe crew entered \"Falcon\" for a second time. Mission Control had them vacuum the spacecraft and then leave the vacuum cleaner running while they did the rest of their \"housekeeping\". This was in an effort to remove any glass particles left in the cabin. During this period, the spacecraft passed the point when the lunar gravity becomes stronger than that of the Earth's as felt by Apollo 15.\n\nAfter a quiet day, the crew had some problems after they discovered a water leak. Due to zero-gravity the water was just a large ball, and although the spacecraft was water-resistant, if it had grown too large and broken apart, water everywhere would have been unpleasant for the crew. The leak came from a loose fitting on the chlorine injector outlet. During the flight the crew would add chlorine to the water to stop any bacterial or fungal growths. The place where this was injected into the tank had come loose.\n\nThe fourth day saw the fourth planned midcourse correction, although it was only the second actually performed on the mission. The burn lasted 0.91 seconds, adding 5.4 ft/s (1.65 m/s) to their speed. The crew then put on their A7L space suits for the jettisoning of the SIM bay door. This door was jettisoned using explosive cord and there was a small risk that it could cause the spacecraft to depressurize. It was possible, in an emergency for the crew to spend the cruise back to Earth in their pressurized space suits.\n\nThe major event of day 4 was lunar orbit insertion (LOI). Occurring behind the Moon, out of contact with the Earth, this engine burn put the spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. It was the first test of the new procedures for using both SPS during a long burn.\n\nLoss of signal (LOS) was at 78 hours, 23 minutes and 31 seconds GET as the spacecraft went behind the Moon as seen from the Earth. This was about 8 minutes before LOI. As with all the LOI performed during Project Apollo it was perfect, the SPS burned for 6 minutes and 38 seconds, placing them into a 169 by 59 nautical miles (313 by 109.3 km) orbit.\n\nMuch of the first hour or so in lunar orbit was spent describing the landforms over which they were orbiting. The crew had become highly trained field geologists, especially Worden who spent time observing the Earth from an airplane, trained by Farouk El-Baz. They also photographed many features, with this crew being the first to enter into a highly inclined orbit. Previous Apollo crews had been in lunar orbits that were just over equatorial regions.\n\nThe descent orbit insertion (DOI) burn was performed behind the Moon on the second orbit. This burn placed them into a 58.8 by 9.5 nautical mile (108.9 by 17.6 km) orbit, with the low point over Hadley Rille landing site. On Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 this burn was done by the lunar module after it had undocked from the CSM. From Apollo 14 onwards, it was done by the CSM as a way of conserving fuel on the LM, allowing it to land with more equipment and consumables on board.\n\nA major issue for all lunar orbiting spacecraft are mass concentrations or \"mascons\". These are regional areas where denser material is under the surface. Apollo 15 travelled over regions that had never been covered on previous flights, so it was unknown how its orbit would be affected by them. Mission Control predicted that by the time the crew awoke the next \"morning\", the lowest point of their orbit, perilune, would have dropped to about 8.6 nm (16.1 km) but this turned out to be an underestimate.\n\nDuring the crew's sleep period, the mass spectrometer was collecting the prime part of its data. The spacecraft was kept in a perfect attitude for the instrument which was designed to investigate the extremely tenuous lunar atmosphere. The \"Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report\" said that most of the measurements of gas made by the spectrometer were actually caused by the spacecraft itself.\n\nThe crew was woken 18 minutes early when it was found that their orbit had decayed to 58.8 by 7.6 nm (108.8 by 14.1 km). The low point was lower than planned for and the crew had to perform a small trim burn to raise this. This was done on the opposite side of the Moon to their landing site at the end of their ninth orbit of the Moon. It was a 20-second burn of the reaction control system (RCS) and added 3.1 ft/s (0.94 m/s) to their speed. It raised the lowest point of their orbit to about 9.6 nm (17.8 km).\n\nDuring the eleventh orbit, Scott and Irwin began to transfer to \"Falcon\". The crew spent the period behind the Moon activating the LM and general housekeeping in preparation for the undocking. They also updated the guidance computer on the LM and made landmark sightings to improve the accuracy of the known position of the landing site.\n\nUndocking was meant to come at the end of their eleventh orbit of the Moon, but was delayed by an improperly attached umbilical that sent the signal to the docking probe to disengage. After Worden fixed the connection, undocking and separation occurred properly about half an orbit late. The only effect of the late separation was the need to delay some landmark sighting by one orbit.\n\nAt the end of the twelfth orbit, Worden performed a circularization burn with SPS, raising the perilune of his orbit. The reason for this was that in the case of an abort during landing by \"Falcon\", a circular orbit is much easier for rendezvous than to an elliptic orbit. Without the LM, the SPS only had to burn for 4 seconds, raising its orbit to 65.2 by 54.8 nm (120.7 by 101.4 km). During the 13th orbit, Worden placed \"Endeavour\" into the science collecting attitude.\n\nOn \"Falcon\", Scott and Irwin continued to check the spacecraft, and prepared for powered descent, when they would burn the descent engine of the LM to begin their landing.\n\n\n"}

He started his studies of the Iroquois in the 1930s and published a number of significant works over the following decades. His final work was published in 2002. During his career, Fenton was director of the New York State Museum and a professor of anthropology at the State University of New York.\n\nFenton was born William Nelson Fenton in New Rochelle, New York, in 1908. The Fenton family had had interactions with the Seneca people since the 1860s. He grew up in the west of New York State, where the Seneca had their traditional territory. After attending local schools, he studied at Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1931. He went on for graduate study and earned a doctorate in anthropology from Yale University in 1937.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Fenton lived among the Seneca in western New York, becoming fluent in their language and doing field studies. The Seneca nation adopted Fenton into the Hawk clan on January 26, 1934. This was the same clan that had adopted Lewis Henry Morgan.\n\nFenton soon became known as a leader of studies of the Iroquois. Fenton wrote a number of position papers during the 1940s and 1950s that outlined problems and issues relating to Iroquois studies which required further work. He encouraged other students of the Iroquois to meet and discuss issues of concern in the field, notably in meetings at Red House in New York. Fenton focused attention on such issues as diversity in culture and connections between northern and southern tribes.\n\nIn his work as an ethnologist with the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, Fenton drew attention to existing historic and ethnographic sources. During the 1930s and 1940s, Fenton undertook substantial studies of Iroquois music and dance while working at the Smithsonian.\n\nAfter becoming senior ethnologist at the Smithsonian Institution in the 1950s, he went to work at the New York State Museum at Albany. Becoming director, he developed an extensive collection of Iroquois materials. Some tribal representatives criticized Fenton for failing to return artifacts. He regarded museums as necessary safeguards for cultural heritage. Some tribal leaders also criticized him for revealing too much material about sacred rituals.\n\nFenton chaired the Committee on Anthropological Research in Museums (CARM) from 1965 to 1973, during the majority of its life. CARM, a subcommittee of the American Anthropological Association, encouraged scholarly use of museums and museum collections in anthropological research. CARM also encouraged the early use of computers in documenting and inventorying museums collections across North America. In 1965 Fenton was awarded the Cornplanter Medal.\n\nFenton left the New York State Museum to become Professor of Anthropology at the State University of New York at Albany. He worked there until his retirement in 1979. He remained active in continued research and writing about the Iroquois. He published \"The Great Law and the Longhouse: A Political History of the Iroquois\" in 1998 when he was nearly 90.\n\nHe died on June 17, 2005 in Cooperstown, New York, at the age of 96, on the way to the hospital.\n\nFenton wrote extensively on Iroquois ethnology, historiography, the history of anthropology, and museum anthropology for several decades.

The koncerz was used more like a lance while on horseback; it provided a rider with a very long reach in a relatively compact format suitable for a sidearm (the typical primary weapon of hussars was a very long lance).

She spent four years in prison for attempted murder and was released in 1988.\n\nJoey Boca (Kevin Kline) is the owner of a pizza parlor located in Tacoma, Washington, and has been married to Rosalie (Tracey Ullman) for years. Their marriage seems a typical one until Rosalie discovers in the public library that Joey is a womanizer and has been cheating on her for a long time, and with multiple women.\n\nRosalie does not want to allow Joey the pleasure of having every woman he wants, so she refuses divorce. Taking extreme measures, she enlists the help of her mother (Joan Plowright), and her young co-worker Devo (River Phoenix), who's secretly in love with her, to kill Joey in order to put an end to his infidelity. They also hire two incompetent, perpetually stoned hit-men, cousins Harlan and Marlon James (William Hurt and Keanu Reeves).\n\nTo her surprise, Joey proves impossible to kill. Even though Rosalie poisons Joey with sleeping pills, he simply gets a stomach cramp, and dismisses it as a virus. They then ask Devo to come over and shoot Joey, but Devo looks away and only ends up wounding Joey behind the ear. When Marlon's cowardice stops him from being present at Joey's murder, Harlan shoots Joey through the chest, missing the intended target of the heart. Eventually a convict at the local commissary reveals their plan, and when the police arrive they find the wounded Joey in some pain. Joey is taken to the hospital, and Rosalie, her mother, Devo, and the James cousins are arrested. Recognizing the errors in his ways and at his mother's behest, Joey refuses to press charges and bails everyone out of jail. As he waits for Rosalie with flowers and a box of chocolates, he meets the James, with whom he makes peace. After meeting Rosalie again, he asks her to take him back, but still offended, she runs out.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C on scale of A to F.\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum, writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", described the film as a \"fair-to-middling black comedy\" and that \"although the pacing is sluggish in spots, people with a taste for acting as impersonation will enjoy some of the scenery chewing—especially by Plowright, Kline, and Hurt\".\n\nRoger Ebert describes the film as \"an actor's dream\" but isn't quite so sure it is a dream film for an audience. He praises Ullman for her performance, noting it is all the more effective against the overtly comic performance of Kline. Ebert remarks \"William Hurt could have walked through the role of the spaced-out hit man, but takes the time to make the character believable and even, in a bleary way, complex\". Ebert suggests Kasdan was attracted to the script because it seems almost impossible to direct, and although he is not sure it succeeds, it is certainly not boring.\n\n"}

In October 1956, Heinkel introduced the Kabine Model 153 (with three wheels) and the Kabine Model 154 (with four wheels), both with 204 cc engines. The engines in these models were later reduced in capacity to 198 cc for insurance purposes.\n\nThe Kabine had a steel unit body. Access to the interior was by an opening front. In order not to infringe Iso Rivolta's patent used on the Isetta, the steering wheel did not hinge outwards with the door to ease passenger access.

While overall rated as Near Threatened, the eastern race \"lunulatus\", also known as the white-crowned, white-naped, or white-collared mangabey (leading to confusion with the collared mangabey), is considered Endangered by the IUCN. The White-collared mangabey was declared its own species by the IUCN in 2016, but it retains the endangered conservation status.\n\nThe sooty mangabey is native to tropical West Africa, being found in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. It lives in both old growth and secondary forests as well as in flooded, dry, swamp, mangrove, and gallery forests. The primate is arboreal and diurnal. They are omnivores whose diet includes primarily fruits and seeds, sometimes feeding on small animals. They live in social groups of four to twelve individuals, but occasionally groups as large as 95 individuals have been recorded.\n\nThere are two distinctive subspecies of this mangabey, and it is possible they should be considered separate species. Both were formerly considered subspecies of a widespread \"Cercocebus torquatus\".\n\n\nSooty mangabeys are naturally infected with a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), known as SIVsmm. Due to extensive human-mangabey contact in sub-Saharan Africa, SIVsmm has jumped from this species into humans on many occasions, resulting in HIV-2 virus. The HIV-1 strain by contrast came from the common chimpanzee strain of SIV.\n\nThe sooty mangabey can also contract leprosy, as can humans, the nine-banded armadillo, the common chimpanzee, and the crab-eating macaque.\n\nThe sooty mangabey is believed to be decreasing in numbers as its forest habitat is degraded, with trees being felled for firewood and timber, and it is hunted for food in some parts of its range. It is more terrestrial than some of its relatives and sometimes raids farms, which brings it into conflict with humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \"near-threatened\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2099255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099255", "title": "Lewis (lifting appliance)", "text": "Lewis (lifting appliance)\n\nA lewis (sometimes called a lewisson) is one of a category of lifting devices used by stonemasons to lift large stones into place with a crane, chain block, or winch. It is inserted into a specially prepared hole, or \"seating\", in the top of a stone, directly above its centre of mass. It works by applying principles of the lever and utilises the weight of the stone to act on the long lever-arms which in turn results in a very high reaction force and friction where the short lever-arms make contact with the stone inside the hole and thereby prevents slipping.\n\nThe name \"lewis\" may come from the Latin \"levo -avi, -atum\" meaning \"to levitate or lift\", but the \"Oxford English Dictionary Online\" states, \"the formation and the phonology are not easily explained on this hypothesis\", preferring \"origin obscure\", and speculating that the term may derive from a personal name. The Romans used the lewis. The specially shaped hole that is shaped to fit the device is known as a \"lewis hole\". Lewis holes in the uppermost masonry coursings are neatly repaired with matching indented plugs after the stone has been set in place.\n\nA lewis is most useful when it is not possible to lift the stone with chains or slings, because of either the location or shape of the stone, or delicate projections. Examples include the closing stone in a string course, cylindrical column drums, decorated column capitals, and coping stones in a pediment. Heavy ashlar stones are also bedded using a lewis.\n\nThe lewis is liable to slip out of the seating if some of the weight of the stone is subtracted from the appliance, such as when the stone bumps on the scaffolding on its way up to its final location. For this reason, a safety sling should always be used together with the lewis until the stone is reasonably close to its final position. Lifting the stone a small distance from the ground before hoisting is the best way to test a lewis. Any sign of looseness or damage should be corrected by adjusting the lewis hole or packing the lewis with metal shims.\n\nBedding a stone using a lewis: The stone is placed on dunnage laid flat with enough clearance for a mortar bed to be placed beneath it. The safety straps are removed, the stone is lifted using the lewis alone, and the dunnage removed with fingers clear. The stone is then lowered onto the mortar bed, and positioned with sharp taps from a rubber mallet.\n\nThere are a number of different types of lewis used in the stonemasonry trade:\n\nA chain-linked lewis or chain lewis is made from two curved steel legs, linked by three steel rings. The legs fit into a seating cut in the top of the stone, above the centre of mass. When the top of the curved legs are pulled together by the rings, the bottom portions are forced into the lower part of the seating, thereby providing enough friction to lift the stone.\n\nThe split-pin lewis is similar to the chain-linked lewis in that it uses a scissor-like action to produce friction against the inside of the lewis hole. The two legs, semicircular in section, lie side-by-side, and fit inside a 32 mm diameter hole drilled to a minimum depth of 82 mm. This type of lewis seating is the simplest to prepare, requiring a single drilled hole.\n\nA two-pinned lewis consists of two 13 mm diameter steel pins, linked by a short chain. The pins are inserted into opposing holes that are drilled into the top of the stone at about 15° from vertical, and at least 75 mm deep. It operates by gripping the stone (like two fingers lifting a tenpin bowling ball) as the weight of the stone is taken up by a crane or winch. The advantage of using this type of lewis is that it is simple to prepare—two angled drill holes are all that is necessary. Like other types of lewis, it is susceptible to pulling out as the stone is lifted. It should always be tested before hoisting, and used in conjunction with safety slings.\n\nA three-legged lewis, also known as a dovetailed lewis, St Peter's keys, or a Wilson bolt fits into a dovetailed seating in the top of a building stone. It is made from three pieces of rectangular-section -thick steel legs held together with a shackle, allowing connection to a lifting hook. The middle leg is square throughout its length, while the outer legs are thinner at the top, flaring towards the bottom. Held together, the three legs thus form a dovetail shape. The lewis hole seating is undercut (similar to a chain-linked lewis hole) to match its profile.\n\nThe first outer leg is inserted into the lewis hole, followed by the second outer leg. The inner (parallel) leg is inserted last, pushing the outer legs into contact with the inside of the lewis hole. The shackle is unbolted, placed over the legs, and the bolt fastened through both the shackle eyes and the eye in the top of each leg. (See gallery below for diagram.)\n\nThis type of lewis is the safest to use because it relies on its dovetailed shape for security instead of friction alone, but the seating is time-consuming to prepare.\n\nTheir resemblance, once assembled, to a bunch of keys gave rise to an alternative name for them of \"St Peter's keys\". This has frequently been represented allegorically, drawing the name of \"St. Peter\" as \"the Rock on which I shall found my Church\" into an allegory between the fabric of a church building and the community of the church itself. Some illustrations of St Peter even show him carrying a bunch of keys which appear to have no wards. These are not keys in the lock-making sense, but in this sense of stonemasonry.\n\nThe external lewis, kerb lifter or slab lifter is a type of lifting device used in the stonemasonry trade since Medieval times. The external lewis was originally shaped like a pair of scissor-tongs, and swung from a treadwheel crane.\nThis type of tong device has been known as dogs and the holes in the stone as dog holes for many centuries. Many old bridges and walls in UK still have dog holes to reveal how the stones were lifted particularly onto bridge parapets. \nThe external lewis has been modified to handle kerbstones and large slabs of polished stone in contemporary stone yards.\n\nA manual kerb lifter is a large, adjustable pair of tongs, made with a pair of handles so that two men can manoeuvre heavy blocks of stone into position. A mechanical kerb lifter can also be made to fit mechanical lifters like forklifts or crane-trucks so that larger stones can be placed.\n\nIn stone yards, a slab lifter is hung from a shed gantry or forklift to transport slabs of stone between storage racks and stone processing machines. It consists of two hinged, weighted friction pads that close astride the top of a slab, and are pulled tightly together by the weight of the slab itself.\n\nThe slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety chains and a support bracket allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting appliance also has a safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated by the weight of the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.\n\n"}

There are 200 or so lochans in the area which makes the place very popular with anglers. Lochinver is dominated by the \"sugar loaf\" shape of \"Caisteal Liath\", the summit peak of nearby Suilven.\n\nLochinver is the second largest fishing port in Scotland; frequented by European fishermen primarily from Spain and France. Lochinver underwent a major renewal project in the 1990s where the harbour area was rebuilt and a new and much improved loading area was created. This new development involved blasting an area of several hectares out of the surrounding rock. At present the area is mostly undeveloped, with the exception a new Sports Centre.\n\nThe back of Lochinver is a beautiful part of Assynt with local tourism and nature areas being developed in conjunction with small-scale forestry activities.

Digital Spy is one of the 150 most visited websites in the UK, according to Alexa.\n\nAs well as breaking news, in-depth features, reviews and authoritative editorial explainers, the site also features the DS Forum.\n\nIn early January 1999, Iain Chapman launched the digiNEWS website, providing news, rumours and information on Sky's new digital satellite platform SkyDigital. At the same time, Chris Butcher launched the ONfaq website, offering similar news and information on the UK's new digital terrestrial platform ONdigital. Both sites proved to be popular, attracting a lot of attention from visitors eager for more news about these rapidly developing TV platforms. Very quickly, Iain and Chris discussed the idea of a merger of the two sites, to create the digiNEWS Network. On 28 February 1999, digiNEWS and ONfaq merged and were rebranded as sites of the new 'digiNEWS network'. More websites joined the network, including Chris Norris's cablenews:uk (covering NTL and TeleWest cable services), Mark Hughes' DVDNews (DVD news and reviews) and Neil Wilkes' TV:uk (TV news and gossip). While the network grew, it was still served from personal webspace from ISPs such as Freeserve, so discussions with website guru Jose Cardoso began and work started on integrating the multitude of sites into a single portal.\n\nIt was important for the new site to be easily accessible, so a .COM address was preferable but the diginews.com address was already taken. After many many emails back and forth, the name 'Digital Spy' was chosen.\n\nThe Digital Spy forums first went live on 1 March 2000, built on the UBB forum platform. The newly named 'Digital Spy' news portal went live on 19 May 2001, running on a custom-built content management system called RAMS (Remote Article Management System).\n\nDigital Spy Limited was incorporated in late 2001 by Alan Jay, Neil Wilkes and Mark Hughes, with Ian Chapman, Jose Cardoso and James Welsh joining later as shareholders.\n\nOn 9 April 2008, it was announced that the website had been purchased by magazine publisher Hachette Filipacchi UK, a subsidiary of the Lagardère Group for a \"significant\" sum.\n\nIn March 2011, former NME.com and FHM.com editor David Moynihan replaced Neil Wilkes as Editor.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, ownership of Hachette UK was sold to Hearst Magazines UK, with the Digital Spy editorial team and operations unaffected.\n\nOn 2 May 2013, Digital Spy won the Media Editorial Team of the Year 2013 at the British Media Awards.

BR added 60000 to their numbers so they became 68006-80, and classified them 4F.\n\nThey were used for shunting in docks, and other similar work where their short wheelbase meant they could negotiate sharp curves.

{"id": "2099289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099289", "title": "Varied carpet beetle", "text": "Varied carpet beetle\n\nThe varied carpet beetle (\"Anthrenus verbasci\") is a 3 mm-long beetle belonging to the family Dermestidae. They are a common species, often considered a pest of domestic houses and, particularly, natural history museums, where the larvae may damage natural fibers and can damage carpets, furniture, clothing, and insect collections. \"A. verbasci\" was also the first insect to be shown to have an annual behavioral rhythm and to date remains a classic example of circannual cycles in animals.\n\nAdult \"A. verbasci\" range in length from . The body is rounded, almost spherical. The elytra and pronotum are covered in fine scales of different colours, creating an irregular pattern of white, brownish and yellowish patches on these features. The white scales are focussed along the lateral margins of the pronotum and on the elytra, where they form three bright, wavy transverse bands. In addition to these morphological features, their antennae are 11-segmented, with a club of 3 segments.\n\nThe larval form of \"A. verbasci\", commonly known as 'woolly bears' (a name shared with the larvae of \"Arctia caja\" and many other moths of the subfamily Arctiinae), measures up to in length. The larvae are elongated and densely covered in large setae (hairs). These hairs are organised into alternating, transverse groups of light and dark-brown patches: the larva appears covered in brown stripes. The body is usually wider at the back than at the front where it also bears 3 pairs of hair tufts along its rear abdomen that can be used for self-defense.\n\n\"A. verbasci\" has a life cycle ranging from 1–3 years, depending upon the environmental conditions. A study in 1958 found that temperature is able to affect larval development, concluding that the periods of incubation and pupation of \"A. verbasci\" decrease with increase of temperature (the life cycle is thus quickened with a modern rise in temperature). Incubation decreased from 54 days at 15 °C to 12 days at 30 °C, and the pupation decreased from 89 days at 10 °C to 9 days at 25 °C. Relative humidity was shown to have little effect.\n\nLarvae hatch from eggs in the spring and early summer, often in the nests of birds (including those of the house sparrow and house swift) or around stored fabrics.\n\nAdults emerge between late May and early August, flying to and feeding on the pollen and nectar of flowering plants. The life expectancy of the beetle is about two weeks. During this period, mating occurs and the eggs are laid, either close to the human environs or in bird nests, tree hollows and similar, dry places where larvae can find their food. Then the cycle begins anew.\n\nThis species is present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic ecozone, in the Near East, in the Nearctic ecozone, in North Africa and in North Asia, also in the Neotropics.\n\nLarvae feed on keratin and chitin of natural fibers (dead insects, animal hair and feathers) throughout their development, eventually experiencing a dormancy period (also known as diapause) prior to pupation into the adult stage. The length of the dormancy appears to depend on environmental factors, with the most likely zeitgeber being photoperiod. Adults feed on the pollen and nectar of flowering plants.\n\nAmong the natural predators of \"A. verbasci\", one of the most well-studied is the parasitoid wasp \"Laelius pedatus\" (in the family Bethylidae). Upon discovering an \"A. verbasci\" larva, a female wasp will land on the larva's dorsal side and attempt to line up its long, stinger-like ovipositor for a paralyzing blow to the thorax. In response, the larva will erect long hairs on their abdomen and attempt to brush these hairs against the encroaching wasp. The hairs detach and stick to the wasp on contact, presumably causing some sort of irritation. Evidently, such irritation is not enough to deter an attack on \"A. verbasci\" larvae, as the vast majority of attacks are successful. By comparison, the closely related beetle species \"Anthrenus flavipes\" – which has slightly longer hairs than \"A. verbasci\" – uses such a defense more effectively.\n\nAfter a single successful sting, the beetle is permanently paralyzed. The entire process from landing to complete paralysis lasts approximately 40 seconds. \"L. pedatus\" does not lay eggs immediately after the beetle is paralyzed, waiting as long as 24 hours before oviposition. During this time, she grooms herself, removing any hairs that might have stuck to her during the attack. During this lengthy process she appears to monitor the larva's state of paralysis by repeatedly biting it and monitoring its reaction. Once sufficiently clear of hairs, the wasp creates a bare patch on the larva's abdomen and lays 2–4 eggs. Eggs hatch in 3–4 days and the larvae feed on the beetle for 3–7 days, eventually killing the host. They then spin cocoons near the empty shell of the host, emerging some time later as adult wasps.\n\nThe larvae of \"A. verbasci\" are a common household pest. Adult beetles usually lay their eggs in air ducts, in closets, under furniture, or under baseboards. Once hatched and until they pupate into adults, the larvae hide in dark, undisturbed areas and feed on organic material. The larvae are thus responsible for the damage of various items, such as furniture, clothing, blankets, furs, and carpets. They are commonly found in musical instruments which have been stored for lengthy periods of time, feeding on pads and felts most commonly found in woodwind instruments.\n\nCollections of specimens, especially of insects, are also vulnerable to attack, making \"A. verbasci\" a common pest in museums. In a 1987 survey of British national history museums, at least five noted that \"A. verbasci\" was categorised as a major pest for biological collections. Larvae are often found in the nests of sparrows and wagtails, and so larvae and adults may enter museums at upper levels through windows and roof spaces.\n\nInfestations can be prevented by removing the larvae and adults through regular vacuum cleaning, dry cleaning or airing clothing outside, placing naphthalene balls in closets, and removing abandoned bird and insect nests attached to the building. Signs of an infestation include the presence of damaged articles, moulted larval skins in dark areas, and an abundance of adult beetles near windows. Susceptible people may also find that hairs shed from the larvae cause irritated itchy welts that may be confused with bedbug bites. Deterring or killing \"A. verbasci\" can be accomplished using insecticides, oxygen deprivation, freezing, and pheromone and scent traps.\n\n"}

{"id": "2099292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099292", "title": "Chainsaw safety features", "text": "Chainsaw safety features\n\nThis article is about risk control methods specific to chainsaws and chainsaw operations. \n\nChainsaws incorporate numerous safety features common to many engine-driven power tools. Manufacturers have invented numerous design features to improve safety. Some features have become \"de facto\" standards, and others are legal requirements in particular jurisdictions. Best practice dictates that an operator should inspect the saw before starting work and only operate the saw if all the safety features are properly functional.\n\nAdditional safety features are a significant commercial advantage to chainsaw producers. Companies continue to develop new features over time. Most chainsaw safety features are focused on the kickback problem, and seek to either avoid it (chain and bar design), or to reduce the risk of injury should it occur (chain brakes).\n\nIn addition to the safety features built into the chainsaw, operators should also wear specific chainsaw safety clothing. Most older saws have few or none of these features, and extra care should be taken in their use.\n\nThe chain has to be properly matched to the guide bar and the saw. Chainsaw manufacturers specify a selection of suitable chains for each model of saw.\n\nBest safety requires that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the depth gauge setting. The depth gauge is the small steel protuberance in front of each cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the depth gauge determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the depth gauge is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.\n\nSome chains also have guard links in front of each cutter link. The guard link reduces the tendency of the leading edge of the depth gauge to snag on small-diameter objects such as small branches, or to engage with ordinary timber if forced into contact with it.\n\nKickback is primarily caused by cutting with the chain in the \"kickback zone\" on the bar, the upper quarter of the nose. Some saws, usually electric saws intended for domestic garden use, shield this whole area from contact with a \"tip protector\". All cutting produces a reaction force on the saw: normally this should be the lower edge of the bar, where the chain is travelling towards the saw and the reaction tends to pull the saw safely \"towards\" the log, against the spur dogs. Where the chain is moving downwards, as at the tip of the bar, the same reaction force now acts \"upwards\" and will cause a kickback upwards.\n\nTip protectors are metal or plastic devices that fit over the bar tip and are usually fitted to small, domestic-class saws. While these are effective, they hamper the saw in terms of the type and capacity of cuts it can execute, and are not widely used. They find a useful application in pole pruners and one-handed battery-powered saws that are used for trimming, hedge laying etc. The hooked nose of the tip protector can be used to \"grab\" branches for cutting, and presents no great drawback since these very small saw units are not used for cuts where the bar tip is buried.\n\nChainsaw carving often makes deliberate use of plunge cuts, and cuts on the tip of the bar. By simply reducing the diameter of the chain nose, the amount of chain, and thus the force generated during a kickback, may be reduced. Specialist carving bars are available with small pointed noses.\n\nChain brakes prevent movement of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, it can be used to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.\n\nThe chain brake is principally operated by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to engage the brake, and pulled back to disengage. The spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in a fraction of a second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset.\n\nThe chain brake may be activated deliberately by the operator, or automatically by the force of a kickback event. In the former, the operator usually rotates his left wrist and knocks the top hand guard forward with the back of his hand, re-setting it by reaching forward with his fingers to pull the top hand guard backwards. In the case of a kickback event the operator's left hand may be violently dislodged from the handle and the top hand guard will be thrown onto his hand, forcing activation of the chainbrake. Husqvarna models also incorporate a link between the top handle and the chain brake trigger, applying the brake if the saw's bar is forced suddenly upwards. This is known as an \"inertia\" chainbrake and will allow activation of the chainbrake even if the operator's left hand is not removed from the handle.\n\nThe chain brake may also be of use when sharpening a chain on a bar, as it allows robust filing to take place without the chain slipping about. \n\n\"Wrap-around\" top-hand guards restrict movement and make no allowance for the fact that when the handle is gripped on the lower section of the handle (left side of the saw from the operator's viewpoint) it is usually for making lateral, right-to-left cuts. In this situation the operator's head, neck and shoulders are out of the cutting plane of the saw and will generally not be struck even if a kickback does occur.\n\nChainsaw kickback can occur when the tip of the bar comes into contact with a relatively massive or immovable object with the chain under power. The area of the bar tip most likely to be involved is known as the \"kickback quarter\". Looking from the side of the bar, the kickback quarter is the 90° section of bar found between a line going along the centreline of the bar, and another line at 90° to the first, rising upwards from the centre of the nose sprocket. If this area of chain comes into contact with - for instance - a log, the chain will initially cut the wood, but will also produce a reaction force which pushes the bar upwards. As the bar rises, the chain is forced harder into contact with the wood and climbs upwards even harder. In a fraction of a second the chain may jam hard into the wood and hurl the bar upwards towards the operator, often causing very severe injury or death. The violence of a full kickback event is such that no evasive action is possible, and if the operator's head, neck or shoulders are in line with the plane of the bar, they will certainly be struck by it. At this point, the operator must rely on the chainbrake and protective clothing to save them from injury or worse.\n\nAnother form of kickback may occur where the top of the bar is used for cutting and becomes suddenly pinched by the wood moving. In this case the saw may be forced backwards towards the operator, or forced into a position where the tip is pinched and the saw transitions into a classic tip-driven kickback. Kickback may also occur as a result of a failed or improperly executed boring cut. Bore cutting is a specialised technique requiring proper training, and should not be attempted without such training.\n\nBy far the most effective tool in preventing kickback is operator training. By preventing contact between the bar tip and solid objects, kickback may be avoided. By keeping their head and body out of the cutting plane of the bar, injury may be prevented if kickback occurs. A useful tip is that if the operator can't read the logo on the side of the bar, they are too close to the cutting plane and should lean left to ensure safety.\n\nCorrect chain sharpening is paramount to safety in this context. Blunt chain cuts poorly and leads to increased operator fatigue and increased bar loading. Depth gauges filed too low make the chain grab at the wood and may negate the benefits offered by safety chain.\n\nChain design plays a major part in kickback reduction. Older, non-safety designs carried only teeth and depth gauges. Since these present a solid leading edge at the depth gauge should an object be suddenly forced into the chain, they can easily be made to engage fully with the foreign body and launch into a full kickback. Careful filing of the depth gauges, making a radius down to the leading edge, reduces the risk somewhat. Newer chains with ramped drive links fill in the gap ahead of the depth gauge, reducing the tendency to grab still further. Full safety chains have extra bumper links between the cutting links, maintaining nearly full depth gauge height along the full extent of the chain and reducing the risk of kickback to very low levels. Full safety (bumpered) chains are often fitted as original equipment to domestic and entry level saws. Modern \"professional\" chains offer far higher cutting performance than full safety chain, and offset their increased risk with an assumption of a much higher degree of operator competence. In reality they are still safer than traditional chains due to the vastly improved depth gauge design, with a deep ramp ahead of the gauge point.\n\nBar design is another factor in reducing kickback risk. The larger the radius of the bar tip, the greater the risk of kickback as the degree of engagement with the log (or other body) will be greater for a larger tip. Domestic class bars, climbing saw bars and entry-level professional bars usually have very small tips. Professional bars designed for logging and felling may have much larger tips as they are often used for boring cuts to free trapped timber or fell difficult trees, and a tapered, small-tipped bar will wedge easily when boring, stalling the chain. A large-tipped bar with nearly parallel sides bores easily and does not tend to jam.\n\nWhile kickback prevention is a great concern in the context of chainsaw use, it is not the only means by which an operator can be injured by a saw. Local conditions, operator competence and many other factors need to be considered before undertaking sawing operations.\n\nThe chain catcher helps prevent the chain being thrown back towards the user, if the chain breaks or becomes derailed. The catcher catches the chain when it derails downwards and shortens it. Then the chain moves underneath the saw body smashing against the rear hand protection at the rear handle (The bottom of the handle is wider to the ba side as to the other). As shown in the image, chain catchers are made of aluminum not to damage the chain. A worn out chain catcher can be changed.\n\nThe engine throttle is operated by the trigger under the rear handle of the saw. Unless the lock-out switch above the rear handle is also pressed, the throttle cannot move from the idle position, and the chain will not be driven.\n\nThe safety throttle prevents the chain from being driven if the trigger is accidentally pushed by an obstruction, such as a branch in undergrowth. It also prevents throttle activation when hot-starting a saw on the ground with one boot inside the rear handle. The safety throttle is an additional layer of protection in this case, since the chainbrake should be applied before starting a saw in any context.\n\nThe pictured model has an enlarged lock-out or 'dead man' switch which, when released, also activates the chain brake, thus instantly halting the running chain as well as disengaging the throttle. When needed the lock can be bypassed with a zip tie.\n\nIn a gas-powered chainsaw, the on/off switch stops the engine running by preventing the ignition coil from firing. This switch is also called kill switch. It must be clearly marked with the stop position. There must be a positive click action, so that there is no chance that the switch will change position accidentally, even while the saw is vibrating under heavy load.\n\nIf the switch were to move to the off position while the operator was in the middle of a critical cut while felling a tree, there would at least be a delay, which increases the chance that the tree might fall in an uncontrolled manner. Also, the saw might jam in the cut, requiring that the operator spend extra time under the unsafe tree freeing it. A switch failing \"on\" would also present a hazard, since the saw may then start inappropriately, such as when testing compression or assessing starter function.\n\nIf the operator is injured while using the saw, a bystander might have to move in to turn the saw off. The bystander may be unfamiliar with the saw and needs to be able to identify the on/off switch by its markings.\n\nThe Stihl model shown combines the choke, throttle start setting and ignition switch into one unified control lever. Other brands of saw usually have separate controls for all three, or a combined throttle start setting and choke control with a separate ignition switch. \n\nIf the switch fails to operate, a saw may be reliably stopped by operating the choke control to flood the engine.\n\nThe centrifugal clutch disengages the chain from the engine when the engine is only at idling speed, engaging the drive automatically when the throttle is squeezed and the engine is at full speed. The purpose of this clutch is to avoid having a moving chain when the saw is idling and temporarily not cutting. At idle the chain should not move.\n\nMany rear-handled chainsaws are used in a state, owing to poor maintenance, where there is some clutch drag and so the chain does move slowly at idle. For top-handled saws though, this is extremely dangerous and the clutch (and chain brake) on such a saw must always be functioning correctly.\n\nSome early chainsaws used a manual clutch instead, but this is long obsolete.\n\nExcessive vibration over long periods can cause the user to develop hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), or white finger. This is a potentially permanent and debilitating industrial injury. To reduce vibration, saws are divided into two parts. One part is a rigid assembly of the cutter bar and engine. This part vibrates strongly when the chain is cutting. The other part is a rigid assembly of the handles and controls of the machine, the part the user holds. These two rigid assemblies are joined together by mounts which provide spring suspension and damping.\n\nBoth metal springs and rubber bushes can be used to provide suspension. Metal springs are more robust and longer wearing, but rubber bushes provide damping in addition to a spring action.\n\nMany modern saws incorporate electrically heated handles. This can help prevent HAVS by encouraging circulation to the fingers. Husqvarna models with this option have a \"G\" suffix after the model number and Dolmar saws an \"H\".\n\nThe front and rear handles of a typical \"rear handle\" chainsaw are widely spaced, so as to provide enough leverage for good control, and also to provide some degree of control in the event of a kickback.\n\nThe operating controls of the chainsaw, such as the throttle and the engine stop (or on/off) switch, are placed so that they may operated whilst retaining a good grip on the rear handle.\n\nIt is impossible to use a rear-handled chainsaw single-handed. Their balance is such that this is not merely unwise, but so impractical as to be beyond a reasonable chance of it even being attempted.\n\nTop-handled chainsaws are a form of chainsaw whose safety is deliberately compromised in order to permit them being used single-handed where this is essential. They are restricted to working at height, such as up a tree. In all other cases, it should be possible to arrange the cutting task so that it can instead be carried out with two hands and the safer rear-handled chainsaw.\n\nIn the top-handled saw, the rear handle and its operating controls are moved to the top of the saw. This gives a balance to the saw such that it \"can\" now be used one-handed. The front handle remains the same. The chain brake lever is usually separate, rather than being combined into the protective hand guard. \n\nIn most cases, the top-handled chainsaw is used two-handed. It is only used single-handed when this is essential, such as when one hand is required for climbing. At ground-level, top-handled saws should not be used.\n\nOwing to the nature of work at height, and the difficulty of continually restarting the saw, the engine will often still be running when it is not used for cutting at that moment. For this reason it is particularly important that the centrifugal clutch is operating correctly so that the chain doesn't rotate when the engine is idling. The chain brake should also be engaged manually when not actually required, which is why top-handled saws usually have an easy brake control lever.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, use and even purchase of top-handled chainsaws is restricted to those holding the relevant certificate of competence in their use. However in the United States such saws may be freely purchased and used.\n\nThe rear hand guard protects the users right hand from being struck by a snapped or derailed chain. It also allows the rear of the saw to be held down by the operator's boot for starting. This is especially useful for cold engines, and larger (70 cc+) saws.\n\nThe majority of chainsaws are designed to be used by a right handed person. Using such a chain saw in a left hand way constitutes an additional safety hazard. A left handed person should learn to use it in a right-handed way.\nThere are no manufactured left hand user chainsaws.\n\nThe exhaust directs the hot and noxious gases coming from the engine away from the user. A faulty exhaust increases noise, decreases engine power, can expose the user to unsafe levels of exhaust gases, and can increase the chance that the user could accidentally touch extremely hot metal. Most models feature a spark screen which is integrated into the muffler. The spark screen prevents sparks from being discharged from the exhaust and potentially igniting sawdust. The spark screen also reduces noise.\n\nIn the EU at least, it is a legal requirement that chainsaws carry certain standardized warning labels which warn of the dangers of kickback as well as making clear the need for protective clothing.\n\nThe cutter chain is sharp enough to cause injury even when it is not being driven. The scabbard covers the chain when the saw is in storage or being transported. It also protects the chain from damage, for instance blunting by contact with concrete floors.\n"}

He served as a war volunteer in World War I and in the Brigade Ehrhardt (1919–1920).\n\nA founding member of the NSDAP in 1921; after the re-establishment of the party, he rejoined in 1925 and quickly became one of Adolf Hitler's favourites. He was appointed Gauleiter of the Gaus Rheinland and Ruhr in 1922-29, then Gauleiter of Hamburg in 1929, a post he was to hold until 1945. He was also member of the German Reichstag. After Hitler gained power on 16 May 1933, Kaufmann was appointed Reichsstatthalter (Regional Governor) of Hamburg with absolute power over some 1.8 million people. One of his first acts was to turn over control of the city's Fuhlsbüttel Prison to the SA and SS, where it quickly became the nucleus of the notorious Kola-Fu concentration camp.\n\nIn September 1941, after Allied bombing of Hamburg had rendered many people homeless, Kaufmann petitioned Hitler to allow him to deport local Jews so that he could confiscate their property to rehouse bombed-out citizens. Hitler quickly responded, allowing Kaufmann the dubious distinction of being the first Nazi leader to deport German Jews, in this instance to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland.\n\nAdolf Hitler declared Hamburg as \"fortress\", similar to the Festung Warschau, the cities of Poznań, or Kolberg. In April 1945, Kaufmann and Commander Generalmajor Alwin Wolz wanted, independently of each other, to capitulate without further struggle. After negotiations and the publication of a pamphlet prepared by Kaufmann—without Kaufmann's consent—Hamburg was declared an \"open city\" by Admiral Karl Dönitz, then president of Germany.\n\nArrested shortly after the occupation of Hamburg by British forces in 1945, in 1946 Kaufmann was witness at the Nuremberg Trials; he was subsequently tried for war crimes and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, but released soon after on the grounds of ill health after an accident. He was to be arrested twice more before being finally released in 1953. Kaufmann died on 4 December 1965 in Hamburg.\n\nIn his book \"Das letzte Kapitel\" (The last chapter) published in 1947, Kurt Detlev Möller described Kaufmann as a \"good \"Gauleiter\"\", a \"rebel against the leader\", and the \"rescuer of Hamburg\", because of the capitulation without struggle of the city of Hamburg.\n\n"}
{"id": "2099307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099307", "title": "Proto-Elamite", "text": "Proto-Elamite\n\nThe Proto-Elamite period, also known as Susa III, is the time from ca. 3400 BC to 2500 BC in the area of Elam. In archaeological terms this corresponds to the late Banesh period, and it is recognized as the oldest civilization in Iran.\n\nThe Proto-Elamite script is an Early Bronze Age writing system briefly in use before the introduction of Elamite cuneiform.\n\nDuring the period 8000–3700 BC, the Fertile Crescent witnessed the spread of small settlements supported by agricultural surplus. Geometric tokens emerged to be used to manage stewardship of this surplus. The earliest tokens now known are those from two sites in the Zagros region of Iran: Tepe Asiab and Ganj-i-Dareh Tepe.\n\nThe Mesopotamian civilization emerged during the period 3700–2900 BC amid the development of technological innovations such as the plough, sailing boats and copper metal working. Clay tablets with pictographic characters appeared in this period to record commercial transactions performed by the temples.\n\nThe most important Proto-Elamite sites are Susa and Anshan. Another important site is Tepe Sialk, where the only remaining Proto-Elamite ziggurat is still seen. Texts in the undeciphered Proto-Elamite script found in Susa are dated to this period. It is thought that the Proto-Elamites were in fact Elamites (Elamite speakers), because of the many cultural similarities (for example, the building of ziggurats), and because no large-scale migration to this area seems to have occurred between the Proto-Elamite period and the later Elamites. But because their script is yet to be deciphered, this theory remains uncertain.\n\nSome anthropologists, such as John Alden, maintain that Proto-Elamite influence grew rapidly at the end of the 4th millennium BC and declined equally rapidly with the establishment of maritime trade in the Persian Gulf several centuries later.\n\nProto-Elamite pottery dating back to the last half of the 5th millennium BC has been found in Tepe Sialk, where Proto-Elamite writing, the first form of writing in Iran, has been found on tablets of this date. The first cylinder seals come from the Proto-Elamite period, as well.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the Proto-Elamite script was the direct predecessor of Linear Elamite. Both scripts remain largely undeciphered, and it is mere speculation to postulate a relationship between the two.\n\nA few Proto-Elamite signs seem either to be loans from the slightly older proto-cuneiform (Late Uruk) tablets of Mesopotamia, or perhaps more likely, to share a common origin. Whereas proto-cuneiform is written in visual hierarchies, Proto-Elamite is written in an in-line style: numerical signs follow the objects they count; some non-numerical signs are 'images' of the objects they represent, although the majority are entirely abstract.\n\nProto-Elamite was used for a brief period around 3000 BC (Jemdet Nasr period in Mesopotamia), whereas Linear Elamite is attested for a similarly brief period in the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC.\n\nProponents of an Elamo-Dravidian relationship have looked for similarities between the Proto-Elamite script and the Indus script.\n\nThe Proto-Elamite writing system was used over a very large geographical area, stretching from Susa in the west, to Tepe Yahya in the east, and perhaps beyond. The known corpus of inscriptions consists of some 1600 tablets, the vast majority unearthed at Susa.\n\nProto-Elamite tablets have been found at the following sites (in order of number of tablets recovered):\n\nNone of the inscribed objects from Ghazir, Chogha Mish or Hissar can be verified as Proto-Elamite; the tablets from Ghazir and Choga Mish are Uruk IV style or numerical tablets, whereas the Hissar object cannot be classified at present. The majority of the Tepe Sialk tablets are also not proto-Elamite, strictly speaking, but belong to the period of close contact between Mesopotamia and Iran, presumably corresponding to Uruk V - IV.\n\nAlthough Proto-Elamite remains undeciphered, the content of many texts is known. This is possible because certain signs, and in particular a majority of the numerical signs, are similar to the neighboring Mesopotamian writing system, proto-cuneiform. In addition, a number of the proto-Elamite signs are actual images of the objects they represent. However, the majority of the proto-Elamite signs are entirely abstract, and their meanings can only be deciphered through careful graphotactical analysis.\n\nWhile the Elamite language has been suggested as a likely candidate underlying the Proto-Elamite inscriptions, there is no positive evidence of this. The earliest Proto-Elamite inscriptions, being purely ideographical, do not in fact contain any linguistic information, and following Friberg's 1978/79 study of Ancient Near Eastern metrology, decipherment attempts have moved away from linguistic methods.\n\nIn 2012, Dr Jacob Dahl of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford, announced a project to make high-quality images of Proto-Elamite clay tablets and publish them online. His hope is that crowdsourcing by academics and amateurs working together would be able to understand the script, despite the presence of mistakes and the lack of phonetic clues. Dahl assisted in making the images of nearly 1600 Proto-Elamite tablets online.\n\nProto-Elamite seals follow the seals of the Uruk period, with which they share many stylistic elements, but display more individuality and a more lively rendering.\n\n\n"}

They formed in 1978 out of the Star Spangled Washboard Band, a \"post-hippie\" comedy jugband. Blotto's music combined new wave and soul/R&B, but with comedic themes. It began as a pick-up band in Saratoga Springs at a club then known as 17 Maple Ave. (later The Metro), with three Washboard Band alumni (who took the stage names Bowtie Blotto, Sergeant Blotto, and Broadway Blotto), plus a drummer and a bassist (Lee Harvey Blotto, and Cheese Blotto). They were joined by Blanche Blotto, who contributed vocals and keyboards and inspired the band's drumhead lady logo. They began to amass a following and played in the New York City area at clubs such as The Ritz, SNAFU, Eighty-Eight, and My Father's Place. DJ Vin Scelsa of WNEW-FM picked up on their initial recording of \"I Wanna Be A Lifeguard,\" which soon became the theme song of the Jones Beach Lifeguards. Their songs were played on the \"Dr. Demento Show\", and they appeared on television's \"Uncle Floyd Show\". They toured frequently and were popular primarily in the northeastern United States, especially among college students.\n\nAfter releasing two EPs on their own Blotto Records label, they produced an early music video for \"I Wanna Be A Lifeguard\" with video production students at SUNY Albany. The video was played on MTV's very first day on the air in 1981, and continued in frequent rotation. This exposure helped the band produce their album \"Combo Akimbo\", which was released with assistance from Peter Pan Records, as well as a \"Video 45\" on VHS from Sony with three videos of Blotto songs that also received wide exposure from airplay on MTV, including \"Metalhead,\" with Buck Dharma from Blue Öyster Cult on lead guitar. Blotto worked with producer Bob Clearmountain on one song on the album. North Lake Sound Chief Engineer, Chris Cassone, produced and engineered the rest of Combo Akimbo. Cassone was also working with Don Roeser (Buck Dharma of BOC) at the time and suggested he hear the homage Blotto had recorded, \"Metalhead.\" Because of a one-time mistaken erasure of a guitar track, he was dubbed \"Eberhard Blotto.\"\n\nThe group disbanded in 1984, with the players pursuing more profitable interests. Drummer Lee Harvey Blotto (Paul Rapp) graduated from Albany Law School, became an attorney specializing in intellectual property law, and continued to play with the band as \"F. Lee Harvey Blotto\" (a pun on the names of famous lawyer F. Lee Bailey and JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald). Bassist \"Cheese Blotto\" (Keith Stephenson) died suddenly in October 1999 of cardiomyopathy brought on by a liver condition. \n\nAll of Blotto's studio recordings (with one exception, the song \"Bud ... Is After Us\") were reissued on a 1994 compact disc compilation, \"Collected Works.\" In 1999, the band released \"Then More Than Ever,\" a CD comprising previously unreleased live concert recordings, excerpts from a 1982 appearance on the \"BBC College Concert\" radio series, and tracks recorded for the never-completed follow-up album to \"Combo Akimbo.\"\n\nThe band in its current incarnation (Broadway, Bowtie, Sergeant, F. Lee Harvey, Clyde and Hammerhead Blotto) is still active, and has reunited for occasional concerts in the Albany area, including an appearance at the 2008 4th of July celebration at Empire State Plaza, and several shows in 2011 at local festivals. On August 6, 2015, the band opened for Blue Öyster Cult at an \"Alive at Five\" concert in Albany.\n\nFounding member and lead vocalist Sarge Blotto (real name Greg Haymes) died on April 10th, 2019.\n\nIn March 2020, Blotto was inducted into the Capital Region Thomas Edison Music Hall of Fame.\n\nGroup members went by pseudonyms on their recordings and in performance. \nThe members of the original lineup were:\n\n\n\nIn addition to their inclusion on the CD \"Collected Works\", Blotto's cover version of Lou Christie's \"Lightning Strikes\" appears on the compilation LP \"Hudson Rock\", and \"Metalhead\" appears on the compilation LP \"Metal For Breakfast\".\n\n"}

She was also a maternal great-aunt of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nA granddaughter of Queen Victoria and an older sister of Alexandra, the last Russian Empress, Elisabeth became famous in Russian society for her beauty and charitable works among the poor. After the Socialist Revolutionary Party's Combat Organization assassinated her husband with a bomb in 1905, Elisabeth publicly forgave Sergei's murderer, Ivan Kalyayev, and campaigned without success for him to be pardoned. She then departed the Imperial Court and became a nun, founding the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent dedicated to helping the downtrodden of Moscow. In 1918 she was arrested and ultimately murdered by the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn 1981 Elisabeth was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nElisabeth was born on 1 November 1864 as the second child of Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Alice, daughter of Queen Victoria. \nShe was given the names \"Elisabeth Alexandra Luise Alix\": \"Elisabeth\" after both St. Elizabeth of Hungary (the ancestress of the House of Hesse) and her paternal grandmother, Princess Elisabeth of Prussia, and \"Luise\" and \"Alix\" after her parents. Elisabeth was known as \"Ella\" within her family.\n\nThough she came from one of the oldest and noblest houses in Germany, Elisabeth and her family lived a rather modest life by royal standards. The children swept the floors and cleaned their own rooms, while their mother sewed dresses herself for the children. During the Austro-Prussian War, Princess Alice often took Elisabeth with her while visiting wounded soldiers in a nearby hospital. In this relatively happy and secure environment, Elisabeth grew up surrounded by English domestic habits, and English became her first language. Later in life, she would tell a friend that, within her family, she and her siblings spoke English to their mother and German to their father.\n\nIn the autumn of 1878, diphtheria swept through the Hesse household, killing Elisabeth's youngest sister, Marie on 16 November, as well as her mother Alice on 14 December. Elisabeth had been sent away to her paternal grandmother's home at the beginning of the outbreak and she was the only member of her family to remain unaffected. When she was finally allowed to return home, she described the meeting as \"terribly sad\" and said that everything was \"like a horrible dream\".\n\nCharming and with a very accommodating personality, Elisabeth was considered by many historians and contemporaries to be one of the most beautiful women in Europe at that time. As a young woman, she caught the eye of her elder cousin, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. He was a student then at Bonn University, and on weekends he often visited his Aunt Alice and his Hessian relatives. During these frequent visits, he fell in love with Elisabeth, writing numerous love poems and regularly sending them to her. Wilhelm proposed to Elisabeth in 1878, only for her to reject him.\n\nBesides the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, she had many other admirers, among them Lord Charles Montagu, the second son of the 7th Duke of Manchester, and Henry Wilson, later a distinguished soldier.\n\nYet another of Elisabeth's suitors was the future Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden, William's first cousin. Queen Victoria described him as \"so good and steady\", with \"such a safe and happy position,\" that when Elisabeth declined to marry him the Queen \"deeply regretted it\". Frederick's grandmother, the Empress Augusta, was so furious at Elisabeth's rejection of Frederick that it took some time for her to forgive Elisabeth.\n\nOther admirers included:\n\n\nUltimately, it was a Grand Duke of Russia who would win Elisabeth's heart; Elisabeth's great-aunt, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, was a frequent visitor to Hesse. During these visits, she was usually accompanied by her youngest sons, Sergei and Paul. Elisabeth had known them since they were children, and she initially viewed them as haughty and reserved. Sergei, especially, was a very serious young man, intensely religious, and he found himself attracted to Elisabeth after seeing her as a young woman for the first time in several years.\n\nAt first, Sergei made little impression on Elisabeth. But after the death of both of his parents within a year of each other, Elisabeth sympathised with Sergei because she had felt this same grief after the death of her mother. Their other similarities (both were artistic and religious) drew them closer together. It was said that Sergei was especially attached to Elisabeth because she had the same character as his beloved mother. So when Sergei proposed to her for the second time, she accepted—much to the chagrin of her grandmother Queen Victoria.\n\nSergei and Elisabeth married on 15 (3) June 1884, at the Chapel of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg; upon her conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, she took the name \"Elizabeth Feodorovna\". It was actually at the wedding that Sergei's 16-year-old nephew, Tsarevich Nicholas, first met his future wife, Elisabeth's youngest surviving sister Alix.\n\nElisabeth was not legally required to convert to Russian Orthodoxy from her native Lutheran religion, but she voluntarily chose to do so in 1891. Although some members of her family questioned her motives, her conversion appears to have been sincere.\n\nThe new Grand Duchess made a good first impression on her husband's family and the Russian people. \"Everyone fell in love with her from the moment she came to Russia from her beloved Darmstadt\", wrote one of Sergei's cousins. The couple settled in the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace in St. Petersburg; after Sergei was appointed Governor-General of Moscow by his elder brother, Tsar Alexander III, in 1892, they resided in one of the Kremlin palaces. During the summer, they stayed at Ilyinskoe, an estate outside Moscow that Sergei had inherited from his mother.\n\nThe couple never had children of their own, but their Ilyinskoe estate was usually filled with parties that Elisabeth organized especially for children. They eventually became the foster parents of Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, Sergei's niece and nephew.\n\nElisabeth was somewhat instrumental in the marriage of her nephew-by-marriage, Tsar Nicholas II, to her youngest sister Alix. Much to the dismay of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth had been encouraging Nicholas, then tsarevich, in his pursuit of Alix. When Nicholas did propose to Alix in 1894, and Alix rejected him on the basis of her refusal to convert to Orthodoxy, it was Elisabeth who spoke with Alix and encouraged her to convert. When Nicholas proposed to her again, a few days later, Alix then accepted.\n\nOn 18 February 1905, Sergei was assassinated in the Kremlin by the Socialist-Revolutionary, Ivan Kalyayev. The event came as a terrible shock to Elisabeth, but she never lost her calm. It was as if her prophecy had come true that \"God will punish us severely\" which she made after the Grand Duke expelled 20,000 Jews from Moscow, by simply surrounding thousands of families' houses with soldiers and expelling the Jews without any notice overnight out of their homes and the city. Her niece Marie later recalled that her aunt's face was \"pale and stricken rigid\" and she would never forget her expression of infinite sadness. In her rooms, said Marie, Elisabeth \"let herself fall weakly into an armchair...her eyes dry and with the same peculiar fixity of gaze, she looked straight into space, and said nothing.\" As visitors came and went, she looked without ever seeming to see them. Throughout the day of her husband's murder, Elisabeth refused to cry. But Marie recalled how her aunt slowly abandoned her rigid self-control, finally breaking down into sobs. Many of her family and friends feared that she would suffer a nervous breakdown, but she quickly recovered her equanimity.\n\nAccording to Edvard Radzinsky, \n\nElizabeth spent all the days before the burial in ceaseless prayer. On her husband's tombstone she wrote: 'Father, release them, they know not what they do.' She understood the words of the Gospels heart and soul, and on the eve of the funeral she demanded to be taken to the prison where Kalyayev was being held. Brought into his cell, she asked, 'Why did you kill my husband?' 'I killed Sergei Alexandrovich because he was a weapon of tyranny. I was taking revenge for the people.' 'Do not listen to your pride. Repent... and I will beg the Sovereign to give you your life. I will ask him for you. I myself have already forgiven you.' On the eve of revolution, she had already found a way out; forgiveness! Forgive through the impossible pain and blood -- and thereby stop it then, at the beginning, this bloody wheel. By her example, poor Ella appealed to society, calling upon the people to live in Christian faith. 'No!\" replied Kalyayev. 'I do not repent. I must die for my deed and I will... My death will be more useful to my cause than Sergei Alexandrovich's death.' Kalyayev was sentenced to death. 'I am pleased with your sentence,' he told the judges. 'I hope that you will carry it out just as openly and publicly as I carried out the sentence of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Learn to look the advancing revolution right in the face.' \n\nKalyayev was hanged on 23 May 1905.\n\nIn 1915 the All-Russian Zemstvo Union was organised under her auspices to provide support for sick and injured soldiers during the First World War.\n\nAfter Sergei's death, Elisabeth wore mourning clothes and became a vegetarian. In 1909, she sold off her magnificent collection of jewels and sold her other luxurious possessions; even her wedding ring was not spared. With the proceeds she opened the Convent of Saints Martha and Mary and became its abbess.\n\nShe soon opened a hospital, a chapel, a pharmacy and an orphanage on its grounds. Elisabeth and her nuns worked tirelessly among the poor and the sick of Moscow. She often visited Moscow's worst slums and did all she could to help alleviate the suffering of the poor.\n\nFor many years, Elisabeth's institution helped the poor and the orphans in Moscow by fostering the prayer and charity of devout women. \n\nIn 1916, Elisabeth had what was to be her final meeting with her sister Alexandra, the tsarina, at Tsarskoye Selo. While the meeting took place in private, the tutor to the tsar's children apparently recalled that the discussion included Elisabeth expressing her concerns over the influence that Grigori Rasputin had over Alexandra and the imperial court, and begging her to heed the warnings of both herself and other members of the imperial family.\n\nIn 2010 a historian claimed that Elisabeth may have been aware that the murder of Rasputin was to take place and secondly, she knew who was going to commit that particular murder when she wrote a letter and sent it to the Tsar and two telegrams to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Zinaida Yusupova, her friend. The telegrams, which were written the night of the murder, reveal that the Grand Duchess was aware of who the murderers were before that information had been released to the public, and she stated that she felt that the killing was a \"patriotic act.\"\n\nIn 1918, Vladimir Lenin ordered the Cheka to arrest Elisabeth. They then exiled her first to Perm, then to Yekaterinburg, where she spent a few days and was joined by others: the Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich; Princes Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstantin Konstantinovich, Igor Konstantinovich and Vladimir Pavlovich Paley; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and Varvara Yakovleva, a sister from the Grand Duchess's convent. They were all taken to Alapayevsk on 20 May 1918, where they were housed in the Napolnaya School on the outskirts of the town.\nAt noon on 17 July, Cheka officer Pyotr Startsev and a few Bolshevik workers came to the school. They took from the prisoners whatever money they had left and announced that they would be transferred that night to the Upper Siniachikhensky factory compound. The Red Army guards were told to leave and Cheka men replaced them. That night the prisoners were awakened and driven in carts on a road leading to the village of Siniachikha, some from Alapayevsk where there was an abandoned iron mine with a pit deep. Here they halted. The Cheka beat all the prisoners before throwing their victims into this pit, Elisabeth being the first. Hand grenades were then hurled down the shaft, but only one victim, Fyodor Remez, died as a result of the grenades.\n\nAccording to the personal account of Vasily Ryabov, one of the killers, Elisabeth and the others survived the initial fall into the mine, prompting Ryabov to toss in a grenade after them. Following the explosion, he claimed to have heard Elisabeth and the others singing an Orthodox hymn from the bottom of the shaft. Unnerved, Ryabov threw down a second grenade, but the singing continued. Finally a large quantity of brushwood was shoved into the opening and set alight, upon which Ryabov posted a guard over the site and departed.\n\nEarly on 18 July 1918, the leader of the Alapayevsk Cheka, Abramov, and the head of the Yekaterinburg Regional Soviet, Beloborodov, who had been involved in the execution of the Imperial Family, exchanged a number of telegrams in a pre-arranged plan saying that the school had been attacked by an \"unidentified gang\". A month later, Alapayevsk fell to the White Army of Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Lenin welcomed Elisabeth's death, remarking that \"virtue with the crown on it is a greater enemy to the world revolution than a hundred tyrant tsars\".\n\nOn 8 October 1918, White Army soldiers discovered the remains of Elisabeth and her companions, still within the shaft where they had been murdered. Despite having lain there for almost three months, the bodies were in relatively good condition. Most were thought to have died slowly from injuries or starvation, rather than the subsequent fire. Elisabeth had died of wounds sustained in her fall into the mine, but before her death had still found strength to bandage the head of the dying Prince Ioann with her wimple. With the Red Army approaching, their remains were removed further east and buried in the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Mission in Peking (now Beijing), China. Elisabeth's body was ultimately taken to Jerusalem, where it was laid to rest in the Church of Mary Magdalene at Gethsemane. The Russian Orthodox Mission in Beijing was demolished in 1957 and its cemetery paved over as a parking lot in 1986.\n\nElisabeth was canonised by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1981, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate as \"Holy Martyr Elizabeth Feodorovna\". Her principal shrines are the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent she founded in Moscow, and the Saint Mary Magdalene Convent on the Mount of Olives, which she and her husband helped build, and where her relics (along with those of Nun Barbara (Varvara Yakovleva, her former maid) are enshrined.\nShe is one of the ten 20th-century martyrs from across the world who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, London, England, and she is also represented in the restored nave screen installed at St Albans Cathedral in April 2015.\n\nA statue of Elisabeth was erected in the garden of her convent in Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Its inscription reads: \"To the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna: With Repentance.\"\n\nOn 8 June 2009, the Prosecutor General of Russia officially posthumously rehabilitated Elizabeth Feodorovna, along with other Romanovs: Mikhail Alexandrovich, Sergei Mikhailovich, Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstantin Konstantinovich and Igor Konstantinovich. \"All of these people were subjected to repression in the form of arrest, deportation and being held by the Cheka without charge,\" said a representative of the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099335", "title": "Lebanese Communist Party", "text": "Lebanese Communist Party\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party – LCP (, transliterated: ') or Parti communiste libanais (PCL) in French, is a communist party in Lebanon. It was founded in 1924 by the Lebanese intellectual, writer and reporter Youssef Ibrahim Yazbek and Fou'ad al-Shmeli, a tobacco worker from Bikfaya.\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party was officially founded on 24 October 1924, in the Lebanese town of Hadath, south of Beirut. The first meeting was made up of union workers, who formed independent unions for the first time in Lebanon (Previously, labor unions were controlled by the French). The meeting was also attended by scholars, academics, writers and journalists who were active in promoting the ideas of the French Revolution, and who were familiar with the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The party was founded to cover the area held under the French mandate, which is now Syria and Lebanon. Initially, the party's name was \"Lebanese People Party\", in an attempt to evade the French ban on \"Bolshevik\" activities.\n\nThe party was declared illegal at first, but the ban was relaxed during World War II. For about twenty years, the LCP organized communist political activities in both Lebanon and Syria, but in 1944 the party was split into the Lebanese Communist Party and the Syrian Communist Party.\n\nDuring the first two decades of Lebanon's independence, the LCP enjoyed little success. In 1943, the party participated in the legislative elections, but failed to win any seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The LCP ran for election again in 1947, but all of its candidates were defeated and the party was outlawed in 1948. During the 1950s, the party's inconsistent policies on Pan-Arabism and the Nasserite movement cost it support and eventually isolated it. The party was active against the government during the 1958 uprising. In 1965, the LCP decided to end its isolation and became a member of the Front for Progressive Parties and National Forces, which later evolved into the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) under Druze leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt. In the mid-1960s, the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 3000.\n\nThe 1970s witnessed something of a resurgence of the LCP. In 1970, Kamal Jumblatt, as Minister of the Interior, legalized the party. This allowed many LCP leaders, including Secretary General Nicolas Shawi, to run for election in 1972. Although they polled several thousand votes, none of them succeeded in gaining a seat.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the LCP established a well-trained militia, the Popular Guard, which participated actively in the fighting at the start of the Lebanese Civil War. The LCP was aligned with the mostly Muslim LNM-Palestinian coalition, even though its membership was mainly Christian (particularly Greek Orthodox and Armenian).\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the LCP generally declined in influence. In 1983, the Tripoli-based Sunni Islamic movement, Islamic Unification Movement (Tawhid), reportedly executed fifty Communists. In 1987, together with the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, the LCP fought a week-long battle against the Shi'a militants of the Amal in West Beirut, a conflict that was stopped by Syrian troops.\n\nAlso in 1987, the LCP held its Fifth Party Congress and was about to oust George Hawi, its Greek Orthodox leader, in favor of Karim Mroue, a Shi'a, as Secretary General. However, Hawi remained in his post. Hawi, who had been a rising opponent of the party's complete dependence on the Soviet Union, was reportedly unpopular for his idealism and unwillingness to compromise his ideology. Mroue was probably the most powerful member of the LCP and was on good terms with Shi'a groups in West Beirut. Nevertheless, between 1984 and 1987 many party leaders and members were assassinated, reportedly by Islamic fundamentalists.\n\nThe end of the Lebanese civil war was in sync with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Two back-to-back congresses saw the exit of Hawi, Mroue and other prominent leaders of the party, which left it in a major crisis. The congresses witnessed the election of Farouq Dahrouj as the new secretary general of the party. Hawi returned to the party as head of its national council (formerly the central committee), but later abdicated in the 1998 8th congress, which saw the second election of Dahrouj as secretary general. The party was then led by Dr. Khaled Hadadi, who was elected in the 9th Congress in December 2003. Saadallah Mazraani, who was Vice General Secretary under Dahrouj, remained in the same position under Hadadi.\n\nThe party is led now by Hanna Gharib.\n\nThe party participated in the 2005 parliamentary elections in several regions but did not win any seats. In South Lebanon, vice general secretary Saadallah Mazraani won 8,886 votes in the second district, and Anwar Yassin, a former detainee in Israel, received 18,244 votes in the first district. Former general secretary Farouq Dahrouj obtained 10,688 votes in the Bekaa third district.\n\nIn the 2009 legislative elections, the LCP ran independently with candidates in five districts but failed to win any seats. In a formal statement, the LCP commented that \"the 2009 elections widened the gap already existing because of the sectarian system,\" and, while expressing dismay at its electoral showing, analyzed and attempted to justify the party's performance.\n\nOn 21 June 2005, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the LCP, was killed in a car bombing in Beirut. Hawi, a recent critic of Syria, claimed a few days before his death that Rifaat al-Assad, uncle of Bashar al-Assad, Syria's current president, masterminded the 1977 assassination of Lebanese opposition leader Kamal Jumblatt. Allies of Hawi accused pro-Syrian forces in the Lebanese-security apparatus for the assassination. Emile Lahoud, then president of Lebanon, and the Syrian government denied this allegation. Foreign governments, including the White House, strongly condemned the killing.\n\nThe bombing occurred two days after Lebanon's 2005 elections ushered in an anti-Syrian majority in parliament and less than one month after Samir Kassir, a left-wing Lebanese journalist and political figure, was assassinated in a bombing.\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party is one of the few Lebanese parties that have affiliations throughout different sects and regions. It is present in most Lebanese districts, but its strength is greatest in South Lebanon. This structure gives the party a national presence, but at the same time weakens its representation in the local and central governmental bodies including municipalities and parliament. The party, as other traditional communist parties, operates through several popular organizations to recruit and spread its political message. These organizations include the Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth (youth organization), The Committee of Woman's Rights (Women's organization), The Popular Aid (Health organization) and The General Union of Workers and Employees in Lebanon (labor union).\n\nThe smallest organizational structure is a branch, usually found in a town or village. Several branches belong to a Regional Committee (usually made up of 5-10 branches), then every few regional committees belong to a Governorate (\"Mohafaza\"). The party has now an estimated membership of around 5000 members.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Abingdon School in Abingdon-on-Thames from 1964 until 1971. He was a member of the badminton first team, for which he was awarded half-colours, in addition to being a cricket first XI player, captain of the colts cricket team and a member of the hockey second XI. Although he enjoyed the sport, he did not enjoy the school ethos, earning a single 'A' Level in Latin.\n\nIn June 1995, he was appointed a \"Steward” of Abingdon School and presented the awards at “Leavers’ Day”.

These observatories, including the first successful space telescope, provided the first high-quality observations of many objects in ultraviolet light. Although two OAO missions were failures, the success of the other two increased awareness within the astronomical community of the benefits of space-based observations, and led to the instigation of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe first OAO was launched successfully on 8 April 1966, carrying instruments to detect ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray emission. Before the instruments could be activated, a power failure resulted in the termination of the mission after three days. The spacecraft was out of control, so that the solar panels could not be deployed to recharge the batteries that would supply power to the electrical and electronic equipment on board.\n\nOAO-2 was launched on 7 December 1968, and carried 11 ultraviolet telescopes. It observed successfully until January 1973, and contributed to many significant astronomical discoveries. Among these were the discovery that comets are surrounded by enormous haloes of hydrogen, several hundred thousand kilometres across, and observations of novae which found that their UV brightness often increased during the decline in their optical brightness.\n\nOAO-B carried a ultraviolet telescope, and should have provided spectra of fainter objects than had previously been observable. The satellite never made it into orbit however; the payload fairing did not separate properly during ascent and the excess weight of it prevented the Centaur stage from achieving orbital velocity. The Centaur and OAO reentered the atmosphere and broke up.\n\nOAO-3 was launched on 21 August 1972, and proved to be the most successful of the OAO missions. It was a collaborative effort between NASA and the UK's Science Research Council (currently known as the Science and Engineering Research Council), and carried an X-ray detector built by University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in addition to an 80 cm UV telescope built by Princeton University. After its launch, it was named \"Copernicus\" to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\n\"Copernicus\" operated until February 1981, and returned high resolution spectra of hundreds of stars along with extensive X-ray observations. Among the significant discoveries made by \"Copernicus\" were the discovery of several long-period pulsars, with rotation times of many minutes instead of the more typical second or less.\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, the location at the corner of Kingsland High Street and Dalston Lane retained the name \"Dalston Junction\" on road and bus signs throughout the period that the station was closed.\n\nRebuilding the station for the London Overground network began with site clearance in early 2005. The station was opened by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on 27 April 2010. A limited weekday \"preview\" service started that day with the first train leaving Dalston Junction at 12.05. The service was of eight trains per hour between Dalston Junction and station from 07:00 to 20:00; four of the eight trains continued to and four to .\n\nThe full service to West Croydon with branches to and began on 23 May 2010, at hours similar to those of the London Underground. The service interval to each of the three southern terminals is approximately fifteen minutes for most of the day, though greater early mornings, late evenings, and parts of Sundays. The South London Line was open to the public on 9 December 2012 and officially launched the next day by the Mayor, with the station now serving as the northern terminus to and trains. (via ) and trains now start from Highbury & Islington.\nIn the first phase of the extension of the East London Line, Dalston Junction was the temporary northern terminus for all trains. From 28 February 2011 to 9 December 2012, trains from West Croydon and Crystal Palace continued beyond Dalston Junction, taking the relaid west curve north of the station to . As stated above, Dalston Junction still remains a terminal for trains, using the two bay platforms in the middle of the station.\nTransport for London and Hackney London Borough Council are currently developing the extensive station site with a bus interchange and high-rise towers above the new station. On 6 December 2012, The Co-operative Food opened a branch, located left of the station's main entrance.\n\nThe new station has two platform islands, the outer sides of each providing through services, the inner bay faces supporting terminating services. Although the route eastward at the north end of the station has been protected it would require substantial reconstruction first. The entire station is underneath a new building development.\n\nThe western of the two chords north of the station was reinstated on 28 February 2011 for East London Line services to . There are no plans to rebuild the eastern chord but its alignment has been safeguarded. The eastern chord was used by Broad Street services to Poplar until 1944 and freight services until 1965. The City Extension to the south was mainly four-track but now has only two. The wide site at Dalston Junction has in the past had six platforms.\n\nRail services are provided by London Overground. Mondays to Saturdays there is a service every 5–10 minutes throughout the day, while on Sundays before 13:00 there is a service every 5–9 minutes, changing to every 7–8 minutes until the end of service after that. Current off peak frequency is:\n\n\nA new Dalston station has been proposed on the Crossrail 2 route between Surrey and North London and Hertfordshire should it be built.\n\n"}

He grew in a show business family. He is the son of Chilean singer Lucho Gatica and Puerto Rican actress Mapita Cortés; he is the nephew of Puerto Rican actress Mapy Cortés and second cousin of Puerto Rican actor, comedian and producer Paquito Cordero. Having celebrity relatives both in Mexico and in Puerto Rico, Gatica wanted to become a celebrity on his own since he was very young. Gatica participated in various theater plays and in some, not particularly notable, music groups as he grew. He struggled trying to follow in his parents' footsteps.\n\nHis first big break came in 1983, when he was hired by Televisa to act in \"La fiera\", which is considered a contemporary classic among telenovelas. In 1984, he played \"Joel\" in \"Los años felices\" (\"The Happy Years\").\nThis was followed by 1986's \"Marionetas\" (\"Puppets\"), where he played \"Jorge Linares\".\n\nHaving obtained celebrity for the first time, Gatica tried his luck in the world of music, retiring from television from 1986 to 1994. Although his foray into the world of rock music was largely unsuccessful, he nevertheless kept active for those eight years, singing in many Mexican locations.\n\nIn 1994, he was offered a return to television, and he did so by participating in another Mexican classic, \"Marimar\", playing \"Chuy\". Gatica then made his film debut, when he participated in 1995's \"Tiempo de Muerte 2\" (\"Time to Die 2\").\n\n\"Tiempo de Muerte 2\" was followed by \"A sangre fría (\"In cold blood\") where he played \"Beto\". In 1996, Gatica returned to acting in telenovelas, participating in \"La antorcha encendida\" (\"The burning torch\"), as \"Juan Foncerrada\" and in \"Mi querida Isabel\" (\"My beloved Isabel\"), where he played \"Ricardo\".\n\nHe took one year off before returning to the screen in 1998, acting as \"Ruben\" in \"Cazador de cazadores\" (\"Hunter of hunters\"), an action movie. That same year, he participated as \"Patricio\" in \"Preciosa\", another telenovela that was successful. That telenovela was followed by another one, \"La mentira\" (\"The Lie\"), where he personified \"Santiago\".\n\nLuis Gatica made one telenovela in 1999: in \"DKDA: Suenos de Juventud\" (\"DKDA: Dreams of Youth\"), he played \"Raul Arias\".\n\nReturning to the film industry in 2000, Gatica played \"Rodrigo Miranda\" in \"Cuenta saldada\" (\"Paid Debt\").\n\nHis next work, however, was in a soap opera marred by general criticism by magazine and newspaper telenovela critics. \"Sin Pecado Concebido\", where he played \"doctor Garduno\", was not well received by the media, which doomed the show with tele-spectators, and the soap opera was not a success.\n\nIn 2002, Gatica joined other celebrities in the \"Big Brother\" reality show, in Mexico City.\n\nGatica began 2003 by participating in another telenovela: he played \"Jorge Esparza\" in \"Niña Amada Mía\" (\"Beloved girl of mine\"). This was followed by \"Clap! El lugar de tus sueños\" (\"Clap! the place of your dreams\"), where he played \"Rivadeneira\", and by 2004's \"Rubí\", where he acted as \"Cayetano\".\n\nIn 2006, he acted in the telenovela produced by José Alberto Castro \"Codigo Postal\", as Herman.\nIn 2008, he appeared in \"En Nombre del Amor\"\nIn 2014, he acted yet again in another telenovela produced by Roberto Gómez Fernandez \"El Color de la Pasión\", as Ricardo Marquez.\n\nIn 2008, he appeared in \"En Nombre del Amor\"\nIn 2014, he acted yet again in another telenovela produced by Roberto Gómez Fernandez \"El Color de la Pasión\", as Ricardo Marquez.\n"}

{"id": "2099456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099456", "title": "Commercial mortgage-backed security", "text": "Commercial mortgage-backed security\n\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are a type of mortgage-backed security backed by commercial mortgages rather than residential real estate. CMBS tend to be more complex and volatile than residential mortgage-backed securities due to the unique nature of the underlying property assets. \n\nCMBS issues are usually structured as multiple tranches, similar to collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), rather than typical residential \"passthroughs.\" The typical structure for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which is not subject to tax at the trust level.\n\nMany American CMBSs carry less prepayment risk than other MBS types, thanks to the structure of commercial mortgages. Commercial mortgages often contain lockout provisions after which they can be subject to defeasance, yield maintenance and prepayment penalties to protect bondholders. European CMBS issues typically have less prepayment protection. Interest on the bonds may be a fixed rate or a floating rate, i.e. based on a benchmark (like LIBOR/EURIBOR) plus a spread.\n\n\"The following is a descriptive passage from the \"Borrower Guide to CMBS\" published by the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association and the Mortgage Banker's Association\":\n\nCommercial real estate first mortgage debt is generally broken down into two basic categories: (1) loans to be securitized (\"CMBS loans\") and (2) portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are originated by a lender and held on its balance sheet through maturity.\n\nIn a CMBS transaction, many single mortgage loans of varying size, property type and location are pooled and transferred to a trust. The trust issues a series of bonds that may vary in yield, duration and payment priority. Nationally recognized rating agencies then assign credit ratings to the various bond classes ranging from investment grade (AAA/Aaa through BBB-/Baa3) to below investment grade (BB+/Ba1 through B-/B3) and an unrated class which is subordinate to the lowest rated bond class.\n\nInvestors choose which CMBS bonds to purchase based on the level of credit risk/yield/duration that they seek. Each month the interest received from all of the pooled loans is paid to the investors, starting with those investors holding the highest rated bonds, until all accrued interest on those bonds is paid. Then interest is paid to the holders of the next highest rated bonds and so on. The same thing occurs with principal as payments are received.\n\nThis sequential payment structure is generally referred to as the \"waterfall\". If there is a shortfall in contractual loan payments from the Borrowers or if loan collateral is liquidated and does not generate sufficient proceeds to meet payments on all bond classes, the investors in the most subordinate bond class will incur a loss with further losses impacting more senior classes in reverse order of priority.\n\nThe typical structure for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A REMIC is a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which is not subject to tax at the trust level. The CMBS transaction is structured and priced based on the assumption that it will not be subject to tax with respect to its activities; therefore, compliance with REMIC regulations is essential. CMBS has become an attractive capital source for commercial mortgage lending because the bonds backed by a pool of loans are generally worth more than the sum of the value of the whole loans. The enhanced liquidity and structure of CMBS attracts a broader range of investors to the commercial mortgage market. This value creation effect allows loans intended for securitization to be aggressively priced, benefiting Borrowers.\n\n\"(Also see primary servicer)\"\nIn some cases the borrower may deal with a primary servicer that may also be the loan originator or mortgage banker who sourced the loan. The primary servicer maintains the direct borrower contact, and the master servicer may sub-contract certain loan administration duties to the primary or sub-servicer.\n\nThe master servicer’s responsibility is to service the loans in the pool through to maturity unless the borrower defaults. The master servicer manages the flow of payments and information and is responsible for the ongoing interaction with the performing borrower.\n\n\"(Also see special servicer)\"\nUpon the occurrence of certain specified events, primarily a default, the administration of the loan is transferred to the special servicer. Besides handling defaulted loans, the special servicer also has approval authority over material servicing actions, such as loan assumptions.\n\nThe most subordinate bond class outstanding at any given point is considered to be the directing certificateholder, also referred to as the controlling class. The investor in the most subordinate bond classes is commonly referred to as the \"B-piece buyer\". B-piece buyers generally purchase the B-rated and BB/Ba-rated bond classes along with the unrated class.\n\nThe trustee’s primary role is to hold all the loan documents and distribute payments received from the master servicer to the bondholders. Although the trustee is typically given broad authority with respect to certain aspects of the loan under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA), the trustee typically delegates its authority to either the special servicer or the master servicer.\n\nThere will be as few as one and as many as four rating agencies involved in rating a securitization. Rating agencies establish bond ratings for each bond class at the time the securitization is closed. They also monitor the pool’s performance and update ratings for investors based on performance, delinquency and potential loss events affecting the loans within the trust.\n\n\n"}

He first appears in the play's third scene, when he storms onto the stage the morning after a hard night out, complaining about the sombre melancholy that hangs over his niece's household. \"What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I'm sure care's an enemy to life.\"\nThis immediately establishes Sir Toby at the opposite pole from the languishing melancholy which dominated the first scene (including Orsino's speech, \"If music be the food of love...\"), identifying him as a force for vitality, noise and good cheer, as his name suggests.\n\nAt the beginning Sir Toby appears to be friends with another character, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, a guest of Olivia, Sir Toby's niece. However as the play progresses, it transpires that Sir Toby is just taking advantage of Sir Andrew's riches.\n\nHis tormenting of the steward Malvolio is similarly double-edged in its tone of \"sportful malice\" (V,1). The plot against Malvolio is generally considered a comic highlight of the play, but critics have often complained of its cruelty. The play ends with the quarrel still unresolved, and Olivia warning that Malvolio \"hath been most notoriously abused\" (V,1).\n\nThough he taunts Malvolio with the demand \"Art any more than a steward?\" (II,3), he only does so after Malvolio has threatened him with being turned out if he doesn't reform his ways. Indeed part of Malvolio's complaint is that Sir Toby and his companions are not acting like noblemen by drinking and singing, but like \"tinkers\" in an \"alehouse\". His appreciation of Maria, though couched in terms that might not please every woman: \"She's a beagle, true-bred\" (II,3), and eventual marriage, shows that he thinks his title of no particular account compared to his love for her.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099487", "title": "Castell Dinas Brân", "text": "Castell Dinas Brân\n\nCastell Dinas Brân is a medieval castle occupying a prominent hilltop site above the town of Llangollen in Denbighshire, Wales. The presently visible castle was probably built in the 1260s by Gruffydd Maelor II, a prince of Powys Fadog, on the site of several earlier structures, including an Iron Age hillfort. \n\n\"Dinas Brân\" has been variously translated as the \"crow's fortress\" or \"fortress of Brân\", with \"Brân\" as the name of an individual or of a nearby stream. An English name, \"Crow Castle\", has also been used since at least the 18th century.\n\nThe first building placed at Dinas Brân was not the castle which now stands in ruins on top of the hill, but an Iron Age hillfort built around 600 BC. An earthen rampart was constructed probably topped by a wooden palisade and this was further protected by a deep ditch on the shallower southern slope. The walls of the hillfort encircled a village of roundhouses. Dinas Brân is one of many hillforts in this part of Wales; Moel y Gaer is just a couple of miles to the north-west near the Horseshoe Pass, and another is close by at Y Gardden in Ruabon to the east. There are many others on the Clwydian Hills further to the north and in the Marches to the south.\n\nDinas Brân is in what was once the ancient Kingdom of Powys. The last Prince of Powys, Gruffydd Maelor, died in 1191 and the kingdom was subsequently divided into Powys Fadog in the north and Powys Wenwynwyn in the south. His son, Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, lord of Powys Fadog, founded the nearby Valle Crucis Abbey. \n\nAlthough no specific archaeological evidence has been found, some records suggest Madog ap Gruffydd ruled from Dinas Brân. If a structure did exist it would have been a wooden fortification probably consisting of a wooden palisade surrounding a hall and other buildings. These early records further say the castle was destroyed by fire, following which a new castle was built on the same site, therefore little prospect for finding any archaeological evidence of the early building remains. \n\nAn even earlier structure has been suggested, belonging to Elisedd ap Gwylog from the 8th century (Ried, 1973). It was this Elisedd who is named on the Pillar of Eliseg and is one of the founders of the kingdom of Powys, but again no physical evidence for any structure at Dinas Brân has been found.\n\nThe castle visible today was probably built by Gruffydd II ap Madog son of Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor sometime in the 1260s. At the time Gruffydd II ap Madog was an ally of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd Prince of Wales, with Powys acting as a buffer state between Llywelyn's heartland of Gwynedd and England. Dinas Brân was one of several castles being built following the signing of the Treaty of Montgomery which had secured Wales for Llywelyn, free from English interference. Indeed, the castle at Dolforwyn Castle near Newtown ordered to be built by Llywelyn around the same time has some similarities to Dinas Brân and may have been the work of the same master mason. \nGruffudd died in 1269 or 1270 and the castle passed down to his four sons. Madoc the eldest son was the senior, but each of the sons may have had apartments at the castle. The peace between Llywelyn and Edward did not last long and in 1276 war started between England and Wales. Edward's larger armies soon invaded Wales and the support for Llywelyn crumbled. Two of the brothers made peace with Edward, the second brother Llywelyn and Madoc. However, the castle was not in Madoc's control as the surrender document with the English refers to conditions relating to the recapture of Dinas Brân. Meanwhile, Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln arrived in Oswestry with forces to capture Dinas Brân. As soon as he had arrived he was told that the defenders of the castle, probably the younger brothers Owain and Gruffudd - who were still allies of Llywelyn Prince of Wales, had set fire to and abandoned the castle. The reason for this action is not clear but it may be that they had no confidence that they could defend the castle against the English forces, and did not want to let it fall intact into Edward's, or their elder brother's hands. The castle was not badly damaged, the fire being mainly limited to the timber structures within the walls and Lincoln recommended to King Edward that the castle be repaired and garrisoned with English troops. Edward placed some troops at the castle at least into the next year 1277 when Llywelyn sued for peace and ordered some repair work to be undertaken.\n\nThe history of the castle during the final war which restarted in 1282 is not recorded. It may have been recaptured by the Welsh like many other castles in the early months of the war, but ultimately the English were victorious. Madoc had by now died: the three surviving brothers all fought for Llewelyn, but to no avail. Following the end of the war in October 1282 and the death of Llywelyn, most of Powys Fadog including the castle was granted to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Rather than rebuild Dinas Brân, De Warenne choose instead to build a new castle at Holt on the Flintshire, Cheshire border and Dinas Brân continued till the present day a picturesque and romantic ruin.\n\nDinas Brân is in layout a rectangular castle with the longer sides running east-west. Beyond the northern wall the steep natural slope falls sharply several hundred feet, whilst the southern and eastern walls are defended by a deep rock-cut ditch and counterscarp bank.\n\nAt the south-eastern corner where the ditch is at its deepest stands the keep, which looks out onto a relatively easy approach to the castle from the River Dee. The two-storey keep would have been the strongest part of the castle, with its own defended approach through a narrow passage. Next to the keep at the north eastern corner is a gatehouse, which was originally approached by a wooden bridge spanning the ditch. There is however almost no evidence remaining of the bridge and its supporting structure so that the exact configuration remains unclear. The bridge was also overlooked by the keep which allowed archers stationed there to guard the entrance. The Gatehouse had two towers either side of a decorated covered passageway into the castle courtyard. \n\nThe Great Hall is sited on the castle's southern side, where some of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows still look south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west end of the room to what was once the Kitchens in the basement of the adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's drawbar.\n\nOriginally, in the enclosed area of the castle there would have been stables, workshops, storage buildings and maybe a chapel but as these were built of wood nothing remains above ground level.\n\nIn the 19th century there was a local tradition, recorded by Walter Hawken Tregellas, that at Tower Farm, about a mile from the castle, had formerly stood a tower that was an outwork of the castle defences.\n\nWhilst the historical record for Dinas Brân is sparse, there are many myths and legends associated with the ancient site.\n\nThe popular Welsh song 'Myfanwy' was composed by Joseph Parry and first published in 1875. Parry wrote the music to lyrics written by Richard Davies ('Mynyddog'; 1833–77). The lyrics were probably inspired by the fourteenth-century love-story of Myfanwy Fychan of Castell Dinas Brân, and the poet Hywel ab Einion. That story was also the subject of the popular poem, 'Myfanwy Fychan' (1858), by John Ceiriog Hughes (1832–87) and of Felicia Hemans's poem 'Howel's Song', set to music by John Parry in his 'Welsh Melodies' (1822).\n\nThe castle first literary appearance is in a 12th-century historical document entitled \"Fouke le Fitz Waryn,\" or \"The Romance of Fulk Fitzwarine.\" In this tale the castle, named \"Chastiel Bran,\" is referred to as a ruin during the early years of the Norman Conquest. The tale continues to tell of an arrogant Norman knight, Payn Peveril, who hears that no one has had courage enough to stay overnight inside the castle ruins, for fear of evil spirits. Payn and 15 'knightly followers' determine to stay the night. A storm blows up and an evil, mace-wielding giant called Gogmagog, appears. Payn defends his men against the attacks of the giant with his shield and cross, then stabs Gogmagog with his sword. As the giant is dying he tells of the earlier bravery of King Brân who had built the castle to try to defeat the giant. Despite King Brân's attempts against Gogmagog the King had been forced to flee and since then the giant had terrorised all the land around for many years. The giant also tells of a great treasury of idols buried at Dinas Brân which includes swans, peacocks, horses and a huge golden ox but dies without revealing its location.\n\nThe etymology of the name Dinas Brân has been debated since at least the 17th century.\n\nIn modern times it is sometimes incorrectly translated as \"the City of Crows\": the word \"dinas\", \"city\" in modern Welsh, in Middle Welsh signifies a defended enclosure, while \"brân\" is the Welsh for \"crow\", singular, (plural: \"brain\"), suggesting a meaning \"the crow's fortress\".\n\nAn alternative theory is that Brân is a personal name. Humphrey Llwyd and William Camden both suggested it came from that of a Gaulish chieftain, \"Brennus\". There is a legend which says that Brân was a Cornish prince, the son of the Duke of Cornwall, while another suggests Brân could be named for King Brân Fendigaid (the Blessed) also called Bendigeidfran, a Celtic God who appears in both Welsh and Irish mythology. Camden also suggested the name was simply derived from the word \"bryn\", \"hill\".\n\nA further suggestion is that \"Brân\" simply refers to a mountain stream of the same name which originated in the Eglwyseg Rocks and ran at the northern foot of the hill, a suggestion made by Thomas Pennant amongst others. The 17th century scholar Edward Lhuyd, in \"Adversaria\", confirmed that to his knowledge the name \"Brân\" came from \"\"the brook of this name by Lhangollen\"\". As with several other streams in Wales, the word \"Brân\" was applied to the brook apparently due to the black colour of its water.\n\nThe castle is known in English as \"Crow Castle\". This form of the name has been used since at least the 18th century, having been recorded in Gough's edition of William Camden's Britannia. By the mid 19th century this was the form of the name said to be used by most of the inhabitants of Llangollen, where there was an inn of the same name.\n\nThe castle may be approached from two directions. From Llangollen the path starts from Canal Bridge and runs beside Ysgol Dinas Brân. It gradually climbs past several cottages before opening out onto the lower slopes of the hill. A zigzag path then climbs to the summit. The other route starts from 'Offa's Dyke Path' on the north western side of the hill. This route is shorter but steeper. Official advice is to equip yourself with stout walking shoes and warm, waterproof clothing before climbing to the castle.\n\nThe castle is a scheduled ancient monument owned and maintained by Denbighshire council with the assistance of Cadw.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Construction of the tower began in 1898 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland, and Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.\n\nIn 1901, Guglielmo Marconi received the first trans-Atlantic wireless message at a position near the tower, the letter \"S\" in Morse Code sent from Poldhu, Cornwall, United Kingdom. Cabot Tower is now the centre of the Signal Hill National Historic Site of Canada, with walking trails and an interpretation centre.\n\nBegun in 1898, to commemorate both Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's (Giovanni Caboto) voyage to the New World, Cabot Tower was completed in 1900 and has been a part of a number of historic events. Although now one of the most recognizable symbols of St. John's and Newfoundland and Labrador, its construction was not well supported in the town. Most of St. John's burned to the ground in 1892 and the banks in Newfoundland crashed in 1894. When Judge D.W. Prowse, a prominent local man, suggested building Cabot Tower, one person said in a local paper that \"it's like putting a silk hat on the head of a man who can't afford to buy a pair of boots.\" Another project, the Victoria Wing of the local hospital, received much more public support.\n\nThe building was used primarily for flag signalling. The British military first used Signal Hill, originally known as the Lookout, for this purpose in around 1704. There was a mast at the highest point on the hill, and it would be the job of a signalman to keep an eye out for ships approaching the city. When one was spotted he would indicate by flag what type of ship it was, what country it was from and fire off a peterra so that the men below in the town would know to look towards the hill. Then they would fire the same type of cannon in response. By the end of the 18th century, a blockhouse had been constructed on the site. By the 19th century, the signalling was done mostly for the various merchants who operated out of St. John's. Cabot Tower was the last in a line of signalling blockhouses built on Signal Hill. It was used for flag signalling until 1958.\n\nIn 1933, a Marconi station, which operated until 1960, was opened on the second floor of Cabot Tower. In 1920, one of the first wireless transatlantic transmissions of the human voice was made there. Men at the wireless station were able to talk with the steamship Victoria which was steaming out of England. Today, the Society of Newfoundland Radio Amateurs operates a ham radio there.\n\nLocated at the highest point of Signal Hill, overlooking the city and the ocean, Cabot Tower is an example of late-Gothic Revival style. Built of irregularly coursed red sandstone, it is composed of a two-story, 30 foot, square structure with a three-story, 50 foot octagonal tower that stands on the southeast corner of the building. The corners are buttressed at the first floor level and further emphasized through the use of heavier blocks of stone. On the main body of the building, at the top of the second storey level, is a line of repeating pattern like an exaggerated dentil row or inverted crenelations. The attached tower, which houses the main entrance, is very plain with a double string course marking the divisions between second and third storeys and heavy corbel tables marking the eight corners of the turret at the flared upper level. The windows on both the corner turret and the body of the tower proper are rectangular and set under heavy stone lintels.\n\nThe architect of Cabot Tower, William Howe Greene, was a prominent St. John's architect and an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects.\n\n"}

A position, for Klein, is a set of psychic functions that correspond to a given phase of development, always appearing during the first year of life, but which are present at all times thereafter and can be reactivated at any time. There are two major positions: the paranoid-schizoid position and the subsequent depressive position. The earlier more primitive position is the paranoid-schizoid position and if an individual's environment and up-bringing are satisfactory, she or he will progress through the depressive position.\n\nThe paranoid-schizoid position is considered the state of mind of children from birth to four or six months of age. Although this position develops into the next position, it is normal to move back and forward between the two positions although some people operate in the paranoid schizoid position for much of the time. As one of the originators of Object Relations theory, Klein sees emotions as always related to other people or objects of emotions. Relations during these first months are not to whole objects but only to part objects, such as the breast, the mother's hands, her face etc.\n\nParanoid refers to the central paranoid anxiety, the fear of invasive malevolence. This is experienced as coming from the outside, but ultimately derives from the projection out of the death instinct. Paranoid anxiety can be understood in terms of anxiety about imminent annihilation and derives from a sense of the destructive or death instinct of the child. In this position before the secure internalisation of a good object to protect the ego, the immature ego deals with its anxiety by splitting off bad feelings and projecting them out. However, this causes paranoia. Schizoid refers to the central defense mechanism: splitting, the vigilant separation of the good object from the bad object.\n\nKlein posited that a healthy development implies that the infant has to split its external world, its objects and itself into two categories: \"good\" (i.e., gratifying, loved, loving) and \"bad\" (i.e. frustrating, hated, persecutory). This splitting makes it possible to introject and identify with the good. In other words: splitting in this stage is useful because it protects the good from being destroyed by the bad. Later, when the ego has developed sufficiently, the bad can be integrated, and ambivalence and conflict can be tolerated.\n\nLater, with greater maturity and the resolution of the depressive position, the ego is able to bring together the good and bad object, which leads to whole object relations. Achieving this involves mourning the loss of the idealised object, and associated depressive anxieties.\n\nKlein described development as proceeding through two phases: the paranoid-schizoid position and the depressive position. In the paranoid-schizoid position, the \"main anxiety\" is paranoia and hypochondria, and the fear is for the self.\n\nWhen things are going well, the mother is experienced as an all benign figure. However, inevitably when needs or desires of the young baby are not immediately met by the mother, because she is not there to fulfill them, the absence of \"the good object\" is experienced as the presence of \"the bad object\".\nThe bad object is then hated and attacked in phantasies. The hated frustrating object quickly becomes persecutory as it is imagined to get revenge in a similar way to how it is being treated. This is why the baby feels persecuted, hence the \"\"paranoid\"\" in paranoid schizoid.\n\nAs well as the bad (aggressive, hateful) parts of the self deriving from the death instinct being projected onto the object, goodness is also projected onto the object. It is easier to see why badness is projected outside the self rather than it being felt to be within. It is more difficult to understand why goodness also may be projected out. The reason for this is that when the person does not feel that they can sustain goodness themselves, it is safer to project it into the object. This is the basis for idealisation, and it can be useful in certain situations, e.g. idealising a surgeon who is operating.\n\nThe projection of badness into the object is the basis of racism, homophobia, or any other irrational hatred of another group seen as (but essentially not being) different from the self, e.g. estate agents, liberals, conservatives, cyclists, car drivers, single mothers, Northerners, Southerners, traffic wardens, etc.\n\nOver time the baby becomes more able to tolerate frustration and hold on to the good object for increasing periods, enabling the baby to tolerate its own bad impulses without fear that these will destroy it. This enables a more realistic view of the self and object as possessing both good and bad attributes, leading to the greater integration and maturity of the depressive position.\n\nKlein emphasizes that the good and bad parts of the self are projected onto or into the object. This represents the operation of the life and death drive, of love and hate.\n\nKlein saw the depressive position as an important developmental milestone that continues to mature throughout the life span. The splitting and part object relations that characterize the earlier phase are succeeded by the capacity to perceive that the other who frustrates is also the one who gratifies. Schizoid defenses are still in evidence, but feelings of guilt, grief, and the desire for reparation gain dominance in the developing mind.\n\nIn the depressive position, the infant is able to experience others as whole, which radically alters object relationships from the earlier phase. “Before the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object. It is only in the depressive position that polar qualities can be seen as different aspects of the same object.” Increasing nearness of good and bad brings a corresponding integration of ego.\n\nIn a development which Grotstein terms the \"primal split\", the infant becomes aware of separateness from the mother. This awareness allows guilt to arise in response to the infant’s previous aggressive phantasies when bad was split from good. The mother’s temporary absences allow for continuous restoration of her “as an image of representation” in the infant mind. Symbolic thought may now arise, and can only emerge once access to the depressive position has been obtained. With the awareness of the primal split, a space is created in which the symbol, the symbolized, and the experiencing subject coexist. History, subjectivity, interiority, and empathy all become possible.\n\nThe anxieties characteristic of the depressive position shift from a fear of being destroyed to a fear of destroying others. In fact or phantasy, one now realizes the capacity to harm or drive away a person who one ambivalently loves. The defenses characteristic of the depressive position include the manic defenses, repression and reparation. The manic defenses are the same defenses evidenced in the paranoid-schizoid position, but now mobilized to protect the mind from depressive anxiety. As the depressive position brings about an increasing integration in the ego, earlier defenses change in character, becoming less intense and allowing increasing awareness of psychic reality.\n\nIn working through depressive anxiety, projections are withdrawn, allowing the other more autonomy, reality, and a separate existence. The infant, whose destructive phantasies were directed towards the bad mother who frustrated, now begins to realize that bad and good, frustrating and satiating, it is always the same mother. Unconscious guilt for destructive phantasies arises in response to the continuing love and attention provided by caretakers.\n\n[As] fears of losing the loved one become active, a very important step is made in the development. These feelings of guilt and distress now enter as a new element into the emotion of love. They become an inherent part of love, and influence it profoundly both in quality and quantity.\n\nFrom this developmental milestone come a capacity for sympathy, responsibility to and concern for others, and an ability to identify with the subjective experience of people one cares about. With the withdrawal of the destructive projections, repression of the aggressive impulses takes place. The child allows caretakers a more separate existence, which facilitates increasing differentiation of inner and outer reality. Omnipotence is lessened, which corresponds to a decrease in guilt and the fear of loss.\n\nWhen all goes well, the developing child is able to comprehend that external others are autonomous people with their own needs and subjectivity.\n\nPreviously, extended absences of the object (the good breast, the mother) was experienced as persecutory, and, according to the theory of unconscious phantasy, the persecuted infant phantisizes destruction of the bad object. The good object who then arrives is not the object which did not arrive. Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.\n\nIn phantasy, the good internal mother can be psychically destroyed by the aggressive impulses. It is crucial that the real parental figures are around to demonstrate the continuity of their love. In this way, the child perceives that what happens to good objects in phantasy does not happen to them in reality. Psychic reality is allowed to evolve as a place separate from the literalness of the physical world.\n\nThrough repeated experience with good enough parenting, the internal image that the child has of external others, that is the child's internal object, is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the pleasure principle is modified by the reality principle.\n\nMelanie Klein saw this surfacing from the depressive position as a prerequisite for social life. Moreover, she viewed the establishment of an inside and an outside world as the start of interpersonal relationships.\n\nKlein argued that people who never succeed in working through the depressive position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings over the death of a loved one may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there because of a lack of differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever.\n\nWilfred Bion articulates the dynamic nature of the positions, a point emphasised by Thomas Ogden, and expanded by John Steiner in terms of '\"The equilibrium between the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions\"'. Ogden and James Grotstein have continued to explore early infantile states of mind, and incorporating the work of Donald Meltzer, Ester Bick and others, postulate a position preceding the paranoid-schizoid. Grotstein, following Bion, also hypothesizes a transcendent position which emerges following attainment of the depressive position. This aspect of both Ogden and Grotstein's work remains controversial for many within classical object relations theory.\n\n\n"}

The Keeling Curve measures the progressive buildup of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere.\n\nKeeling was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania to Ralph Keeling and Grace L Keeling (née Sherberne). His father, an investment banker, excited interests of astronomy in a 5-year-old Charles, while his mother instilled a lifelong love of music. He graduated with a degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1948. Charles Keeling earned a PhD in chemistry from Northwestern University in 1953 under Malcolm Dole, a polymer chemist. Most of Dole's graduates were going straight into the oil industry; Keeling \"had trouble seeing the future this way\" and had become interested in geology, for which he had acquired most of the undergraduate coursework during his PhD. Keeling had applied for postdoctoral positions as a chemist almost exclusively to geology departments \"west of the continental divide.\" He received an offer from Harrison Brown who had recently started a geochemistry department at California Institute of Technology. He was a postdoctoral fellow in geochemistry there until he joined Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1956, and was appointed professor of oceanography there in 1968.\n\nAt Caltech he developed the first instrument able to measure carbon dioxide in atmospheric samples with consistently reliable accuracy. Keeling camped at Big Sur where he used his new device to measure the level of carbon dioxide and found that it had risen since the 19th century.\n\nKeeling worked at the Scripps Institution for 43 years during which time he published many influential papers. Roger Revelle, the Director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, based at La Jolla, California, persuaded Keeling to continue his work there. Revelle was also one of the founders of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957–58 and Keeling received IGY funding to establish a base on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, two miles (3,000 m) above sea level.\n\nKeeling started collecting carbon dioxide samples at the base in 1958. By 1960, he had established that there are strong seasonal variations in carbon dioxide levels with peak levels reached in the late northern hemisphere winter. A reduction in carbon dioxide followed during spring and early summer each year as plant growth increased in the land-rich northern hemisphere. In 1961, Keeling produced data showing that carbon dioxide levels were rising steadily in what later became known as the \"Keeling Curve\".\n\nIn the early 1960s, the National Science Foundation stopped supporting his research, calling the outcome \"routine\". Despite this lack of interest, the Foundation used Keeling's research in its warning in 1963 of rapidly increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases. A 1965 report from President Johnson's Science Advisory Committee similarly warned of the dangers of extra heat-trapping gases, which cause the temperature of the Earth to rise.\n\nThe data collection started by Keeling and continued at Mauna Loa is the longest continuous record of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the world and is considered a reliable indicator of the global trend in the mid-level troposphere. Keeling's research showed that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide grew from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 380 (ppm) in 2005, with increases correlated to fossil fuel emissions. There has also been an increase in seasonal variation in samples from the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n\nKeeling was an enthusiastic outdoorsman who made many hiking and camping trips to the Western mountains, particularly the Cascade Mountains of Washington state. He was an active member of the Wilderness Society for much of his life.\n\nKeeling married Louise Barthold in 1954. They had five children, one of whom (Ralph Keeling) followed in his father's footsteps and was a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Charles Keeling was also an accomplished classical pianist who almost chose a career in music. Keeling was a founding director of the University of California San Diego Madrigal Singers. He was also general chairman of the citizens committee which drafted the Del Mar General Plan (or \"Community Plan\") in 1975.\n\nKeeling died in 2005, aged 77, of a heart attack.\n\n\nKeeling was a Guggenheim fellow at the Meteorological Institute, University of Stockholm (1961–62); a guest professor at the Second Physical Institute of the University of Heidelberg (1969–70) and the Physical Institute of the University of Bern (1979–80).\n\nHe was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe was a member of the commission on global pollution of the International Association of Meteorology, and scientific director of the Central CO Calibration Laboratory of the World Meteorological Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They had taken delivery of the Westland Wessex helicopter, which could carry a load slung beneath.\n\nThe smallest Land Rover available at the time was a Series IIA 88 inch (2235 mm) wheelbase, which was too heavy. Land Rover began work on a lightweight version to fit the specifications in 1965. A new modification to the basic Series IIA was devised by making many body components easily detachable and removing many non-essential items. The result was the Land Rover Half-Ton, known widely as the \"Lightweight\" or \"Airportable\". In practice, to reduce weight sufficiently for the helicopters of the day to lift them in combat conditions, the tilt (roof) and sticks, the upper parts of the body, the doors and windscreen were removed, to be refitted later. The most significant change, however, was a reduction in width by 4 inch (100 mm), by redesigning the standard Series IIA axles and fitting shorter half-shafts, which meant it would fit on a standard pallet.\n\nComplete, the Lightweight IIA weighed , over the specified weight. The term \"Lightweight\" appears misleading as a standard 88 Land Rover weighed , but the higher total weight was due to the various frame reinforcement required for military usage. However, with the removable body panels taken-off it was below the limit. Since improvements to the helicopters meant more lift was available, the MoD accepted it for use. The main applications were actually to be shipped by cargo aircraft or stacked on train wagons, with helicopter transport a rare occurrence.\n\nThe first production models were completed on 11 November 1968, and production continued until 1984.\n\nAlthough a very few prototypes had been built between 1965 and 1967, and about six pre-production models early in 1968, 'Lightweight' Series IIA quantity production began on 11 November 1968, with a total of 15 vehicles being produced on that day. Total production of Series IIa 'Lightweights' was between 1,500 and 2,000 vehicles. Later Series IIa models had the headlamps moved out into a revised front wing, to comply with revised lighting regulations. It is easy to confuse later Series IIa models with the Series III, though nothing was changed on these vehicles other than the location of the headlamps.\n\nThe Series IIA Lightweight was replaced by the Series III Lightweight in 1972, soon after the replacement of the civilian Series IIA with the Series III. The vehicle remained in essence the same, with a few relatively minor changes - there are detail differences to the chassis; and a revised gearbox had synchromesh on second through fourth gears instead of just third and fourth. In the electrical department the Series III was fitted with an alternator in place of the dynamo of the Series IIa; the new indicator switch incorporates a headlamp flasher and horn; and the ignition switch was now fitted in a new steering column cowl instead of on the dashboard.

The current school building was constructed in 1965. The school underwent extensive construction and renovation from 1998 to 2002 and experienced another addition of more classrooms which was completed prior to the 2007/2008 school year. With the newly opened Ninth Grade Center, the school boasts over under one continuous roof.\n\nThe school is named for the 1880s Vandalia Railroad Executive Benjamin Davis. He was instrumental in getting a stop on the railroad for a small community that would come to bear his name. The community members were so appreciative of Davis's efforts that they named the stop after him. The community around the stop became known as \"Ben Davis\".\n\nThe first Ben Davis High School was built in 1892. That school was replaced in the early 20th century by a bigger building at the corner of what is now Morris Street and High School Road. During the Great Depression, a larger school was built just up the road as part of the Works Progress Administration. Ben Davis High School remained in that location until the current building was established in 1965. The old Ben Davis Junior High School was renovated and now serves as Ben Davis University High School.\n\nBen Davis High School has received the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence award from the United States Department of Education.\n\nThe school is part of the Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township.\n\nBen Davis High School has won multiple state championships under the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA). They have won a total of 28 IHSAA state championships:\n\nBen Davis High School is a member of the Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference, which is known as one of the most competitive conferences in the Midwest. The team's nickname is the Giants. The 2008/2009 Lady Giants basketball team finished the season ranked number one in the nation by \"USA Today\"'s Top 25 poll and ESPN's Rise Poll. This marks the third team national championship in school history. Boys' Track and Field 2009 being the second and the 1991 football team was national champion in the former ESPN/Scholastic Sports America poll, as well as the National Prep Poll and National Sports News Service Poll.\n\nThe school also has a speech, debate, journalism, and communications program. Ben Davis is home to WBDG Giant 90.9 FM, a 400-Watt FM radio station operated by students. WBDG went on the air in 1966 and continues to broadcast today 24 hours, 7 days per week. BDHS publishes a student yearbook called \"Keyhole\", \"Giant Visions\", a literary magazine, and a student newspaper, \"Spotlight\". In 2003, the school re-launched BDTV, a video production house, within the Area 31 Career Center where students produce a weekly school newscast and a variety of other video productions for the township.\n\nBen Davis provides a career center which provides vocational training and serves nine regional schools, (Avon High School, Brownsburg High School, Cascade High School, Danville Community High School, Decatur Central High School, Monrovia High School, Mooresville Consolidated High School, Speedway High School, Tri-West High School).\n\nThe school has been authorized to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.\n\nThe Ben Davis Marching Giants have traveled across the country on invitation to march in various parades and festivals, including the King Kamehameha parade in Honolulu, Hawaii, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California and The Inaugural Parade for President Reagan Jan. 1985 in Washington DC. The band has also won numerous Indiana state titles, finishing first in the Indiana state competition in 1976, 1977, 1982, 1984–88, and 1993. Also, the band has had success on the national level, finishing ninth in the Bands of America National Marching Band Competition in 1981 and second in 1982, and finishing ninth and tenth in the Bands of America Grand National Championships in 2004 and 2008, respectively. In 2012, the Marching Giants traveled to Pasadena to again represent Ben Davis High School in the Tournament of Roses Parade. The Marching Giants were also the champions at the Indiana State Fair Band Day five times in 1960, 1961, 1964, 1966, and 1967.\n\nIn 2014, the Ben Davis Winter Guard won the school's first IHSCGA Open Class State Championship. The guard were repeat champions in 2015.\n\nBen Davis has three competitive choirs. \"Purple-Aires\" is an advanced concert choir that has been named grand champion at numerous competitions throughout the years. \"Premiers\" is a mixed show choir which consistently places in the top five at area competitions. In 2010, the \"Premiers\" attended the ISSMA Choir State Championships where they placed 2nd overall and won the best vocal sound caption award. \"Sounds,\" formerly known as \"Soundsations,\" is a women's show choir. \"Sounds\" placed second at the 2010 ISSMA State Show Choir State Championships. Sounds were named ISSMA Women's Show Choir State Champions at the 2011 and 2013 championships.\n\nBen Davis' Theatre Department is expanding, increasing their season to include four shows throughout the year.

{"id": "2099535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099535", "title": "Nana (echos)", "text": "Nana (echos)\n\nPhthora nana (Medieval Greek ) is one of the ten modes of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos consisting of 8 diatonic echoi and two additional phthorai. It is used in different traditions of Orthodox chant until today (→ Neobyzantine Octoechos). The name \"nana\" is taken from the syllables (written in ligatures \"ʅʅ\") sung during the intonation which precedes a melody composed in this mode. The name \"phthora\" derived from the verb and means \"destroy\" or \"corrupt\". It was usually referred to the diatonic genus of the eight mode system and as a sign used in Byzantine chant notation it indicated a \"change to another genus\" (), in the particular case of phthora nana a change to the enharmonic genus. Today the \"nana\" intonation has become the standard name of the third authentic mode which is called \"echos tritos\" () in Greek and \"third glas\" () in Old Church Slavonic.\n\nIn the theory and notation of Byzantine and Orthodox chant nana is the name of a special phthora which had been used in different ways according to its historic context:\n\nIt is supposed that the Hagiopolites treatise served during the 9th century as a manual preceding a chant book called \"tropologion\". The book contained a collection of simple hymns troparia as well as heirmoi which served as melodic models () for the 10 modes of Octoechos.\n\nNana holds the status one of the two \"special\" additional echoi or \"mesoi\" (medial forms between authentic and plagal echoi) in the system of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos. The other one is called nenano. Already in the Hagiopolites treatise the phthorai nana and nenano have been characterized as both echoi and \"not echoi, but phthorai\" (→ phthora). This means that they were proper modes with their own models, but they had to be integrated within the Octoechos and its eight-week cycle. Thus, phthora nana was subordinated to the tetartos, and the treatise also referred to it as \"Mesos tetartos\": as a third medial mode of the tetartos which was neither authentic (kyrios) nor plagal (plagios).\n\nThe concrete intervals of the enharmonic genus are less subject than the explanation of relationships between the modes. Often certain paragraphs of the Hagiopolites concerned about the phthora nana have been re-interpreted again and again according to the current tradition of psaltic art.\n\nIn contemporary theoretical explanations the phthora nana had not only been regarded as a melodic model for stichera and heirmoi, but also as a transition model as well, which mainly connected tritos with tetartos echoi.\n\nAccording to theoretical explanations of the Papadike, phthora nana was not only defined by its melos like a proper echos itself, as such it had been subordinated to certain echoi already in the Hagiopolites treatise. Manuel Chrysaphes, Lampadarios at the Byzantine court, emphasised that phthora nana is only used as a phthora of the echos tritos, but within its melos it causes always a change into the echos plagios tetartos. Any other changes have to be made after the transition into the plagios tetartos:\n\nHe also mentioned that the phthora had its own solfège (parallage), so that it solved the diatonic echos tritos and binds it to the echos plagios tetartos ( \"binding and solving\").\n\nThe distinction, that it was by the own solfège (\"apo parallagon\") \"like a kyrios echos of its own\" (\"os echos kyrios\"), meant on the surface, that the tritos could be based on the octave on B flat (heptaphonia) with the finalis F, while it had to change into the tetartos octave which was based on C and therefore used b natural as seventh degree. The triphonic solfège could be solved again from the enharmonic into the diatonic genus, but it was in fact not just a change of the genus (, \"metavole kata genos\"), but also a change from the triphonic into the tetraphonic tone system (, \"metavole kata systema\"). It was not organised by separated tetrachords (tetraphonia), but by connected ones (triphonia: C—F—b flat). Hence, the \"own triphonic parallage\" intermediated between both octave species, which were otherwise very far from each other. Already in this transitional function it formed an alternative melos of the tetartos echoi.\n\nThe phthora could intermediate, because it was distinct by its triphonic tone system and its enharmonic genus (the minor tone was always on the top of a tetrachord and smaller than a Western half tone—a diesis). Ioannis Plousiadinos invented an own system of parallage in shape of a square made up by four X. It was constructed to represent the triphonic combinations of conjunct tetrachords, but only the last two X on the bottom described the triphonia of the phthora nana—the triphonia based on echos varys (left) and the triphonia based on the plagios tetartos (right). Both possibilities were illustrated at the end of John Koukouzeles' didactic chant Mega Ison.\n\nThe Papadikai list between six and ten phthorai which represent the ten modes of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos—the diatonic eight modes (which did not need eight phthorai, since the echoi just represented the four elements of a tetrachord) and the two additional phthorai as their own echoi.\n\nIn this very particular sense, the term \"phthora\" did neither refer to nenano nor nana, but simply meant the use of a transposition sign in order to indicate the precise place of a temporary transposition ().\n\nNote also, that these phthorai <nowiki>[</nowiki> and <nowiki>]</nowiki> are different from those of , and or , since the phthorai of the latter <nowiki>[</nowiki>diatonic<nowiki>]</nowiki> echoi bind or solve quickly and thus, they only create a temporary change from one echos to another one, this is the only purpose they have.\n\nThe list of phthora did not include one to indicate a change into the melos of phthora nana. This change was instead caused by one of the great signs (), the xeron klasma (), like here in the sticherarion of the Biblioteca ambrosiana, where the medial signature of phthora nana (a temporary change into its melos) is prepared by this great sign.\n\nThis sticheron could be sung as well by a protopsaltes in the soloistic kalophonic style. If the medial signature of nana was the end of the section chosen for the realisation of a \"sticheron kalophonikon\", this sign could cause, that a whole kratema, a section in abstract syllables like for instance, was created in the phthora nana as an echos kratema.\n\nThe phthora nana was called in various theories \"phthora atzem\" which referred to perde acem (the fret on the long necked lute tambur called \"acem\" which was a common reference for Ottoman musicians) or even to makam acem—the \"Persian makam\" or \"phthora.\" Panagiotes Keltzanides' edition offered a seyir—a melodic example to illustrate makam acem—on page 81:\n\nIt is close to the melodic models of the Persian Dastgāh-e Šur.\n\nThe reform of the Byzantine neume notation in the early 19th century redefined the mele according to each genre (troparic, heirmologic, sticheraric, papadic), it also transcribed for the first time the rhythm which was so far part of an oral tradition or method, how to do the thesis of the melos. In these transcriptions the diatonic tritos echoi had little relevance. Chrysanthos of Madytos, together with Chourmouzios the Archivist and Gregorios the Protopsaltes one of the three \"great teachers\" that undertook the reform, published a treatise explaining the principles of the new system, entitled \"Theoretikon Mega tes Mousikes\".\n\nWhile there was once a diatonic form of echos tritos and echos varys, it has no longer any relevance for the current tradition of Orthodox chant, even if it based on Byzantine monodic chant. Orthodox chanters know nowadays only the intonation \"nana\" (), when they would like to perform melodies composed in echos tritos. Already Papadikai of the 16th century identified \"nana\" signature in their lists with the diatonic intonation \"aneanes.\" But its long formula was already replaced by the short of in Chrysanthos explanation of the former papadic practice of solfège using the enechemata:\n\nThis simple form is used until today, but Chrysanthos also developed its whole melos as a kind of exegesis (\"interpretation\") of the simple traditional echema of phthora nana:\n\nChrysanthos' exegesis of the real nana intonation uses the enharmonic intervals:\n\nHence, if the melos of the enharmonic genus starts on F , F γα and b flat [] should be symphonous, and not the phthongos c νη'. And like the diatonic and chromatic scales are made of tetraphonia, here they are made of triphonia:\nThus, also conjunct similar tetrachords are constructed by the same intervals in the middle [12+13+3=28]: C —D is equal to F —G , D —E sharp [] to G —a , E sharp []—F is equal to a —b flat [], etc.\n\nHe applied this intonation to the traditional varys enechema:\n\nThere is also a diatonic form of echos varys, but according to Chrysanthos' adaption to the Ottoman tone system it was no longer based on a pentachord between kyrios tritos and varys, but on a tritonus on a low b natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099543", "title": "Waterproofing", "text": "Waterproofing\n\nWaterproofing is the process of making an object or structure waterproof or water-resistant so that it remains relatively unaffected by water or resisting the ingress of water under specified conditions. Such items may be used in wet environments or underwater to specified depths.\n\n\"Water-resistant\" and \"waterproof\" often refer to penetration of water in its liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas \"damp proof\" refers to resistance to humidity or dampness. Permeation of water vapour through a material or structure is reported as a moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR).\n\nThe hulls of boats and ships were once waterproofed by applying tar or pitch. Modern items may be waterproofed by applying water-repellent coatings or by sealing seams with gaskets or o-rings.\n\nWaterproofing is used in reference to building structures (such as basements, decks, or wet areas), watercraft, canvas, clothing (raincoats or waders), electronic devices and paper packaging (such as cartons for liquids).\n\nIn construction, a building or structure is waterproofed with the use of membranes and coatings to protect contents and structural integrity. The waterproofing of the building envelope in construction specifications is listed under \"07 - Thermal and Moisture Protection\" within MasterFormat 2004, by the Construction Specifications Institute, and includes roofing and waterproofing materials.\n\nIn building construction, waterproofing is a fundamental aspect of creating a building envelope, which is a controlled environment. The roof covering materials, siding, foundations, and all of the various penetrations through these surfaces must be \"water-resistant\" and sometimes waterproof. Roofing materials are generally designed to be water-resistant and shed water from a sloping roof, but in some conditions, such as ice damming and on flat roofs, the roofing must be waterproof. Many types of waterproof membrane systems are available, including felt paper or tar paper with asphalt or tar to make a built-up roof, other bituminous waterproofing, ethylene propylene diene monomer EPDM rubber, hypalon, polyvinyl chloride, liquid roofing, and more.\n\nWalls are not subjected to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps are designed to be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor barriers or air barriers. Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.\n\nWithin the waterproofing industry, below-ground waterproofing is generally divided into two areas:\n\nIn buildings using earth sheltering, a potential problem is a too much humidity, so waterproofing is critical. Water seepage can lead to mold growth, causing significant damage and air quality issues. Properly waterproofing foundation walls is required to prevent deterioration and seepage.\n\nAnother specialized area of waterproofing is rooftop decks and balconies. Waterproofing systems have become quite sophisticated and are a very specialized area. Failed waterproof decks, polymer or tile, are one of the leading causes of water damage to building structures, and of personal injury when they fail. Where major problems occur in the construction industry is when improper products are used for the wrong application. While the term \"waterproof\" is used for many products, each of them has a very specific area of application, and when manufacturer specifications and installation procedures are not followed, the consequences can be severe. Another factor is the impact of expansion and contraction on waterproofing systems for decks. Decks constantly move with changes in temperatures, putting stress on the waterproofing systems. One of the leading causes of waterproof deck system failures is the movement of underlying substrates (plywood) that cause too much stress on the membranes resulting in a failure of the system. While beyond the scope of this reference document, waterproofing of decks and balconies is a complex of many complimentary elements. These include the waterproofing membrane used, adequate slope-drainage, proper flashing details, and proper construction materials.\n\nThe penetrations through a building envelope must be built in a way such that water does not enter the building, such as using flashing and special fittings for pipes, vents, wires, etc. Some caulkings are durable, but many are unreliable for waterproofing.\n\nAlso, many types of geomembranes are available to control water, gases, or pollution.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to the 2010s, the construction industry has had technological advances in waterproofing materials, including \"integral waterproofing systems\" and more advanced membrane materials. Integral systems such as hycrete work within the matrix of a concrete structure, giving the concrete itself a waterproof quality. There are two main types of integral waterproofing systems: the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic systems. A hydrophilic system typically uses a crystallization technology that replaces the water in the concrete with insoluble crystals. Various brands available in the market claim similar properties, but not all can react with a wide range of cement hydration by-products and thus require caution. Hydrophobic systems use concrete sealers or even fatty acids to block pores within the concrete, preventing water passage.\n\nSometimes the same materials used to keep water out of buildings are used to keep water in, such as a pool or pond liners.\n\nNew membrane materials seek to overcome shortcomings in older methods like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Generally, new technology in waterproof membranes relies on polymer-based materials that are very adhesive to create a seamless barrier around the outside of a structure.\n\nWaterproofing should not be confused with roofing, since roofing cannot necessarily withstand hydrostatic head while waterproofing can.\n\nThe standards for waterproofing bathrooms in domestic construction have improved over the years, due in large part to the general tightening of building codes.\n\nSome garments, and tents, are designed to give greater or lesser protection against rain. For urban use raincoats and jackets are used; for outdoor activities in rough weather there is a range of hiking apparel. Typical descriptions are \"showerproof\", \"water resistant\", and \"waterproof\". These terms are not precisely defined. A showerproof garment will usually be treated with a water-resisting coating, but is not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. This is suitable for protection against light rain, but after a short time water will penetrate. A water-resistant garment is similar, perhaps slightly more resistant to water but also not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. A garment described as waterproof will have a water-repellent coating, with the seams also taped to prevent water ingress there. Better waterproof garments have a membrane lining designed to keep water out but allow trapped moisture to escape (\"breathability\")—a \"totally\" waterproof garment would retain body sweat and become clammy. Waterproof garments specify their hydrostatic rating, ranging from 1,500 for light rain, to 20,000 for heavy rain.\n\nWaterproof garments are intended for use in weather conditions which are often windy as well as wet and are usually also wind resistant.\n\nFootwear can also be made waterproof by using a variety of methods including but not limited to, the application of beeswax, waterproofing spray, or mink oil\n\nWaterproofing methods have been implemented in many types of objects, including paper packaging, cosmetics, and more recently, consumer electronics. Electronic devices used in military and severe commercial environments are routinely conformally coated in accordance with IPC-CC-830 to resist moisture and corrosion but encapsulation is needed to become truly waterproof. Even though it is possible to find waterproof wrapping or other types of protective cases for electronic devices, a new technology-enabled the release of diverse waterproof smartphones and tablets in 2013. This method is based on a special nanotechnology coating a thousand times thinner than a human hair which protects electronic equipment from damage due to the penetration of water. Several manufacturers use the nano coating method on their smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras.\nA 2013 study found that nanotextured surfaces using cone forms produce highly water-repellent surfaces. These nanocone textures are \"superhydrophobic\" (extremely water-hating).\n\n"}

It was acquired by M. Frank Jones of Kansas City, Missouri in 1965. Jones was owner, editor and publisher until 1970, when \"Bon Appétit\" was merged into the Pillsbury Company, who sold it to Knapp Communications, publishers of \"Architectural Digest\", four years later. Condé Nast Publications, the current owners, purchased Knapp Communications in 1993. Its sister publication was \"Gourmet\", before the latter was discontinued in October 2009. The magazine's headquarters, which had been in Los Angeles, CA, was moved to New York City in early 2011.\n\nThe current editor is Adam Rapoport, previously Style Editor at Condé Nast's \"GQ\" magazine. Prior to joining \"GQ\", Rapoport edited the restaurant section at \"Time Out New York\" and worked as an editor and writer for the James Beard Foundation's publications office.\n\nFor the print edition, Condé Nast reported 1,452,953 paid subscriptions and 88,516 single copies in 2012 for the period ending November 2012. The median age of its audience was 48.4, of which 74% were female. Also, 46% of readers had college degrees, 36% were professional or managerial employment, and 59% were married.\n\n\"Bon Appétit\"s \"Bite me\" advertising campaign in 2011 had an estimated $500,000 budget that included print and online ads, billboards, posters, and sweepstakes. The ad campaign came after a period of \"sluggish performance\" since its sibling magazine \"Gourmet\" was cancelled in 2009, during which a limited number of readers and advertisers shifted to \"Bon Appétit\". During the same period, other food magazines, such as \"Every Day With Rachael Ray\" and \"Food Network Magazine\" thrived. \"Bon Appétit\" sold 632 ad pages in 2012, which was a one percent increase from 625 ad pages sold in 2009 but a decline of 27 percent from the 867 ad pages sold in 2008.\n\nIn recent years, \"Bon Appétit\" has increased their web presence through the use of social media, their website, and their YouTube channel. From 2018 to 2019, \"Bon Appétit\" saw a 40 percent increase in video revenue and a 64 percent increase in subscriptions generated from digital channels such as social media plugs, podcasts, and newsletters. The company has begun efforts to leverage the popularity of \"Bon Appétit's\" YouTube and streaming channels towards increasing magazine readership. This included the November 2019 edition of the magazine, which had eight separate covers featuring the staff of the \"Bon Appétit\" Test Kitchen seen on the channels. As well, advertiser interest has increased, with many companies being drawn to the connections the shows’ hosts have with their audience. These companies have included Goose Island Beer, The Mushroom Council, Mitsubishi, Wine Australia and Glossier.\n\nIn 2012, \"Bon Appétit\" launched a YouTube channel primarily featuring traditional \"hands-and-pans\" cooking tutorials.\n\nOn October 21, 2016, the first episode of \"It's Alive with Brad\" debuted. The series began with videos of Brad Leone, the Test Kitchen Manager at the time, in the \"Bon Appétit\" Test Kitchen demonstrating recipes for foods with microbial food cultures, but later moved on to more general recipes as well as outdoor segments at agricultural and food processing sites, including a cocoa farm, a sea salt harvesting facility, and a sausage factory. The series features a casual, unproduced style and comedic editing. The series was edited by Matt Hunziker and filmed and produced by Vincent Cross until Cross's departure in early 2019 to fellow cooking YouTube channel, \"Binging with Babish\". It is now filmed, produced, and edited by Hunziker, whose style has been credited with shaping the aesthetic of the entire \"Bon Appétit\" YouTube channel, including shaky cam-style filming, frequent cameos by non-featured chefs, and a focus on kitchen mistakes.\n\nIn July 2017, \"Gourmet Makes\" with Claire Saffitz debuted, in which Saffitz attempts to recreate or elevate popular snack foods such as Doritos, Twinkies, and Gushers. \"Gourmet Makes\" consistently trends on YouTube and has developed a cult following on social media. Saffitz' work has been described as taking \"junk food staples and...elevating them from their humble processed beginnings into wonders of gastronomy.\"\n\nThe loose and personality-driven style of \"It's Alive\", along with \"Gourmet Makes\", are noted as contrasting the \"curated [and] posh\" brand of \"Bon Appétit\" and were described by \"Forbes\" as having \"changed the way Condé Nast approaches online video.\" As a result, in February 2019, \"Bon Appétit\" launched three new series on a streaming channel which took a more personality driven approach to their content: \"Bon Appétit’s Baking School\", a spin-off of \"It’s Alive\" titled \"It’s Alive: Going Places\", and \"Making Perfect\". \"Bon Appétit’s Baking School\" was presented by Saffitz and taught the basics of baking a cake in a five-part series. The first season of \"It’s Alive: Going Places\" followed Leone as he traveled Central Texas, and was followed by a second season in June 2019 which followed Leone in Hawaii.\nThe first season of \"Making Perfect\" starred Andy Baraghani, Molly Baz, Brad Leone, Chris Morocco, Carla Lalli Music, and Claire Saffitz, and focused on making the perfect pizza. It was followed by a second season in October 2019, with the additions of Christina Chaey and Rick Martinez. The second season focused on making the perfect Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe entire lineup of on-camera staff and contributors at \"Bon Appétit\" appear in the series \"From The Test Kitchen\", which features more traditionally structured instructional recipe videos, as well as \"Test Kitchen Talks\", with videos of the chefs competing in cooking challenges and answering common cooking questions. Several other series feature the individual chefs. Chris Morocco stars in \"Reverse Engineering\", in which he attempts to reverse engineer a recipe by a celebrity chef from taste, touch, and smell alone. Carla Lalli Music stars in \"Back-to-Back Chef\", in which she cooks along with and instructs a celebrity in preparing a dish while facing away from each other and using only verbal instructions. The series' guests have included Natalie Portman, Antoni Porowski, Ninja, Miz Cracker, Braun Strowman and more. Additionally, chefs Bobby Flay, Daniel Boulud, and Gordon Ramsay have guest hosted the series.\n\n\"Bon Appétit\" films regular collaborations with other notable YouTube channels, including \"First We Feast\" and \"Binging with Babish\", with Sean Evans of \"Hot Ones\" and Andrew Rea of \"Binging with Babish\" appearing on multiple \"Bon Appétit\" series, and \"Bon Appétit\" personalities appearing on \"First We Feast\" and \"Binging with Babish's\" respective series. Several other guests have appeared on \"It's Alive\", including Elias Cairo of Olympia Provisions, chef Matty Matheson, chef Samin Nosrat, and musician Orville Peck.\n\nVideos are primarily filmed in the \"Bon Appétit\" Test Kitchen on the 35th floor of the One World Trade Center in Manhattan, where it is part of Condé Nast's headquarters. Bon Appétit won the 2020 Webby Award for Food & Drink in the category Social and 2020 Webby Award and Webby People’s Voice Award for Food & Drink in the category Web.\n\nSince 2009, \"Bon Appétit\"'s Deputy and Restaurant Editor Andrew Knowlton, later joined by Senior Editor Julia Kramer, has put together a list of the Best New Restaurant in the US. The list is released annually at the end of August for the September issue that begins with 50 restaurants that is narrowed down to a Top 10 list. The first two years, the list was not in a specific order.\n\nIn 2014, \"Bon Appétit\" launched a podcast called the \"Bon Appétit Foodcast\". The series is hosted by editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport, and has featured notable guests such as Ina Garten, Gordon Ramsay, and Mark Bittman. A number of the staff at \"Bon Appétit\" regularly appear on the podcast to discuss their recently published recipes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099569", "title": "Schemmerhofen", "text": "Schemmerhofen\n\nSchemmerhofen () is a municipality (\"Gemeinde\") in the district (\"Landkreis\") of Biberach in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Schemmerhofen is located in the Upper Swabia region (\"Oberschwaben\" or \"Schwäbisches Oberland\") of Baden-Württemberg.\n\nThe municipality of Schemmerhofen is located north of the district town (\"Kreisstadt\") Biberach an der Riß. The municipality includes, in addition to the village of Schemmerhofen, the formerly autonomous villages of Schemmerberg, Ingerkingen, Altheim, Aßmannshardt and Alberweiler. The settlements (\"Wohnplätze\") Bachhof, Britschweiler, Brühlhof, Eichelsteig, Grafenwald, Mittenweiler, Öschhof and Ziegelei likewise fall under the municipality's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Mühlbach River flows through Aßmannshardt, Alberweiler and Schemmerhofen before emptying into the Riß River. The Riß River in turn travels north through Schemmerberg before flowing into the Danube River.\n\nThe municipality has a total population of 8,082.\n\nIt is impossible today to determine whether the term \"Scammara\" in a document in the year 851 referred to the village of Langenschemmern or Schemmerberg. Later references to \"ad Scammares\" in 1095, \"Schamern\" in 1127, \"Scammun\" in 1242 and \"Krutschemmern\" in 1319, indicate that no distinction was made during this period between the two towns. Only in 1361 is \"Landenschammar\" referenced for the first time.\n\nFrom the end of the 14th century, a distinction was made between \"Oberschemmern\" and \"Unterschemmern\" (Upper and Lower Schemmern), even though the shortened name \"Schemmern,\" as well as the name used today, was also mentioned during this period. \"Schemmern\" is related to the word \"Schiene\" and refers to the reedbeds in the Riß River valley.\n\nOriginally, the hamlets of \"Aufhofen\" and \"Langenschemmern\" formed a single political entity. However, after the annexation by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806, the inhabitants of Aufhofen chose to secede from Langenschemmern. Since the properties of the inhabitants were spread over the territories of both villages, the separation was not completed until 1843.\n\nAs part of the territorial reform (\"Gebietsreform\") in Baden-Württemberg, Langenschemmern and Aufhofen reunited on 1 August 1972 to become the community of Schemmerhofen.\n\nSchemmerhofen currently has a population of 2928.\n\n Schemmerberg has a population of 1220.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1267 as \"Schamerberg\", Schemmerberg has had its own parish church, dedicated to Saint Martin, since 1275. The origin of this church dates back to the earlier period of Christianization of Upper Swabia in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nOriginally belonging to the Herren of Schaemmern, Schemmerberg was divided in the late Middle Ages: one part belonging to the Counts of Wartstein and the other to the Herren of Sulmetingen. Both of these dominions held their land rights in Schemmerberg as vassals of the Austrian House of Habsburg.\n\nThe Counts of Wartstein sold their rights incrementally to the Imperial Abbey Salem during the 13th and 14th century. When Jakob and Sebastian von Sulmetingen also sold their possessions in Schemmerberg to the Imperial Abbey Salem in 1496, the entire village was owned by this abbey. As part of the Salem Abbey, Schemmerberg fell under the jurisdiction of the bailiffs of Upper Swabia, who resided in Altdorf. Due to the distance to Altdorf, King Maximilian I granted the Salem Abbey the right to establish a legal court in Schemmerberg in 1497.\n\nDuring the German Peasants' War, the Baltringer Haufen looted and destroyed the Schemmerberg Castle on 26 March 1525, after the resident monks had fled to Biberach an der Riss. The castle was rebuilt in 1532 and eventually demolished in 1837.\n\nIn 1742, the Salem Abbey received the privilege to inflict high justice (\"Blutgerichtsbarkeit\" or \"Blutgericht\").\n\nFollowing the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, (the mediatisation and secularisation of numerous secular and ecclesiastical principalities within the former Holy Roman Empire) Schemmerberg became subject to the princely house of Thurn und Taxis. In 1806, Schemmerberg was annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg.\n\nOn January 1, 1974, Schemmerberg was incorporated into the municipality of Schemmerhofen.\n\n Ingerkingen has a population of 1194.\n\nIngerkingen is a village situated along the road connecting the former Free Imperial Cities Biberach and Ehingen. This road was of Roman origin.\n\nThe existence of a local aristocratic dynasty was first documented when, in 1246, Friedrich von Magenbuch transferred ownership of a demesne to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. In the course of this transaction, the brothers Konrad and Hermann von Ingerichingen renounced their rights to the demesne. Furthermore, several members of the local aristocracy appeared as witnesses in documents: in 1263 and 1286 a certain Konrad von Ingerichingen and in 1298 a certain Dietherus von Ingiringen. In 1314 Reinhard von Ingerichingen donated farms in the hamlet of Edenbachen to the Imperial Ochsenhausen Abbey.\n\nAlthough Ingerkingen was under the jurisdiction of the Austrian house of Habsburg, the Imperial Knight of Stadion were enfeoffed with this right. When a royal decree on 10 December 1494 extended this jurisdiction to all inhabitants of Ingerkingen, a long-lasting conflict with the monastery of Buchau and the Imperial City of Biberach ensued, both of which feared this would infringe the rights they held in Ingerkingen. This was only resolved when Hans-Walter von Stadion sold the rights of low and high justice together with six farms of varying size to Biberach on 5 April 1526. The Imperial City of Biberach was to be the owner of Ingerkingen until 1801, when, as a result of the Treaty of Lunéville, the village fell to the Margrave of Baden, Charles Frederick, only to be annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806.\n\nOn 1 January 1975, Ingerkingen was incorporated into the municipality of Schemmerhofen.\n\n Altheim has a population of 686.\n\nFirst mentioned in 851, Altheim is believed to be a Frankish foundation.\n\nAfter having belonged to the territory of the Imperial Knight of Warthausen and their successors, the Counts of Wartenstein during the 13th and 14th centuries, the ownership of the village became divided between several entities. In 1304, parts of the village came into the ownership of the Imperial Abbey of Salem. The rest of the village belonged to the dynasty of the Imperial Knight of Stadion. This part was transferred into the possession of the Imperial Knight of Schienen zu Gammerschwang in 1505, who in turn transferred it to the Imperial Knight of Stauffenberg in 1591. On 12 November 1621, Hans Christoph Schenk von Stauffenberg sold half the village to the Imperial Abbey of Salem.\n\nThe development of the village was heavily influenced by these incessant partitions of rulership.\nIn 1699, Altheim counted 12 houses belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, 33 houses to the Imperial Knight of Stauffenberg and 2 houses to the monastery of Buchau.\n\nTogether with Schemmerberg, Altheim first fell to the princely house of Thurn and Taxis, following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, only to be annexed by the newly formed Kingdom Württemberg in 1806.\n\nOn 1 January 1975, Altheim was incorporated into the municipality of Schemmerhofen.\n\n Aßmannshardt has a population of 865.\n\nAßmannshardt was first mentioned as \"Aßmundeshart\" around 1180 in the Codex Hirsaugiensis, a book which systematically recorded all donations to Hirsau Abbey. Evidence of earlier settlement has been discovered in several tumuli which were dated to the Hallstadt culture. The name of the village contains the elements of a personal name \"Asmunt\" and the word \"hart\" which means forest or meadow.\n\ntoponymic evidence, such as \"Leithauser Wiesen\", \"Lindacher-Weg-Ösch\" and \"Aufhofer Weiher\", suggests that there were more settlements on the territory that now constitutes the village of Aßmannshardt. Another name of a village now lost is mentioned when during the late Middle Ages a conflict arose between the parish Aßmannshardt and Attenweiler regarding the rights held in \"Husshoven\".\n\nA local aristocratic dynasty was first recorded at the end of the 13th century when, in 1288, Konrad Schenk von Asmushard donated a meadow in Altheim. After 1300, the village was held by Seneschal Walter von Warthausen as a fief from Count Walter von Landau. Together with Warthausen, the village was sold to the house of Habsburg in 1331. It remained under the ultimate sovereignty of the house of Habsurg until 1806, being part of the barony of Warthausen. Warthausen, having been mortgaged several times, finally came into the possession of the Imperial City of Biberach in 1446 only to be released from Biberach's rule after the Protestant Reformation was introduced there. In 1529, Martin Schad of Mittelbiberach acquired the rights to Warthasuen and the village of Aßmannshardt. His family owned the village until they died out in the agnatic line in 1696, after which the Counts of Stadion were enfeoffed with Warthausen and thereby also Aßmannshardt.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), Aßmannshardt was devastated. Most of the inhabitants died of war, plague and starvation. The village itself was burnt down. In order to repopulate the village, settlers from the Alps were introduced, mostly from Montafon and Vorarlberg. In 1662, there was not a single inhabitant who had either been born or brought up in the village.\n\nThe barony, which officially had been part of the Kingdom of Württemberg since 1806, was sold to the state on 16 January 1826 by Johann Philipp Eduard von Stadion, thereby relinquishing all seigneurial rights.\n\nOn 1 January 1975, Aßmannshardt was incorporated into the municipality of Schemmerhofen.\n\n Alberweiler has a population of 753.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the village was founded in the 8th or 9th century. In the 11th century, Alberweiler consisted of seven fishermen's huts, a chapel and the local castle (Alberweiler Castle). In 1092 a parish church was mentioned.\nAlberweiler was subject to the Counts of Warthausen, a collateral line of which had its residence there, until 1585, when it came into the possession of the Counts of Stadion.\n\nThe hamlet of \"Grafenwald\" belonged to Alberweiler. Originally owned by the Counts of Berg, the forest was cleared in 1581 and, following further clearing in 1683, was farmed by four tenants.\n\nOn 1 January 1975, Alberweiler was incorporated into the municipality of Schemmerhofen.\n\nThe municipal council consists of 19 members, each representing the whole municipality. Each council member is elected for a five-year term. The council is chaired by the mayor.\n\n\nSchemmerhofen is a predominantly agricultural municipality. There is no large scale industry.\n\nSchemmerhofen is situated on the Bundesstraße 465 as well as on the Ulm-Friedrichshafen rail line. The closest passenger rail station is in Schemmerberg. The Langenschemmern station is only used by freight trains to transport sand and gravel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099596", "title": "Ampacity", "text": "Ampacity\n\nAmpacity is a portmanteau for \"ampere capacity\" defined by National Electrical Codes, in some North American countries. Ampacity is defined as the maximum current, in amperes, that a conductor can carry continuously under the conditions of use without exceeding its temperature rating.\nAlso described as current-carrying capacity.\n\nThe ampacity of a conductor depends on its ability to dissipate heat without damage to the conductor or its insulation. This is a function of the \ninsulation temperature rating, the electrical resistance of the conductor material, the ambient temperature, and the ability of the insulated conductor to dissipate heat to the surrounds.\n\nAll common electrical conductors have some resistance to the flow of electricity. Electric current flowing through them causes voltage drop and power dissipation, which heats conductors. Copper or aluminum can conduct a large amount of current without damage, but long before conductor damage, insulation would, typically, be damaged by the resultant heat.\n\nThe ampacity for a conductor is based on physical and electrical properties of the material and construction of the conductor and of its insulation, ambient temperature, and environmental conditions adjacent to the conductor. Having a large overall surface area can dissipate heat well if the environment can absorb the heat.\n\nIn electrical cables different conditions govern, and installation regulations normally specify that the most severe condition along the run will govern each cable conductor's rating. Cables run in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in proximity. When multiple cables are in proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual cable conductors. The overall ampacity of insulated cable conductors in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable. Usually the derating factor is tabulated in a nation's wiring regulations.\n\nDepending on the type of insulating material, common maximum allowable temperatures at the surface of the conductor are 60, 75, and 90 °C, often with an ambient air temperature of 30 °C. In the United States, 105 °C is allowed with ambient of 40 °C, for larger power cables, especially those operating at more than 2 kV. Likewise, specific insulations are rated 150, 200, or 250 °C.\n\nThe allowed current in a conductor generally needs to be decreased (derated) when conductors are in a grouping or cable, enclosed in conduit, or an enclosure restricting heat dissipation. e.g. The United States National Electrical Code, Table 310.15(B)(16), specifies that up to three 8 AWG copper wires having a common insulating material (THWN) in a raceway, cable, or direct burial has an ampacity of 50 A when the ambient air is 30 °C, the conductor surface temperature allowed to be 75 °C. A single insulated conductor in free air has 70 A rating.\n\nAmpacity rating is normally for continuous current, and short periods of overcurrent occur without harm in most cabling systems. Electrical code rules will give ratings for wiring where short-term loads are present, for example, in a hoisting motor. For systems such as underground power transmission cables, evaluation of the short-term over-load capacity of the cable system requires a detailed analysis of the cable's thermal environment and an evaluation of the commercial value of the lost service life due to excess temperature rise.\n\nDesign of an electrical system will normally include consideration of the current-carrying capacity of all conductors of the system.\n\nSome devices are limited by power rating, and when this power rating occurs below their current limit, it is not necessary to know the current limit to design a system. A common example of this is lightbulb holders.\n\nFor electronic components (such as transistors, voltage regulators, and the like), the term current rating is more-commonly used than ampacity, but the considerations are broadly similar. However the tolerance of short-term overcurrent is near zero for semiconductor devices, as their thermal capacities are extremely small.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099600", "title": "Attribute-oriented programming", "text": "Attribute-oriented programming\n\nAttribute-oriented programming (@OP) is a program-level marking technique. Programmers can mark program elements (e.g. classes and methods) to indicate that they maintain application-specific or domain-specific semantics. For example, some programmers may define a \"logging\" attribute and associate it with a method to indicate the method should implement a logging function, while other programmers may define a \"web service\" attribute and associate it with a class to indicate the class should be implemented as a web service. Attributes separate application's core logic (or business logic) from application-specific or domain-specific semantics (e.g. logging and web service functions). By hiding the implementation details of those semantics from program code, attributes increase the level of programming abstraction and reduce programming complexity, resulting in simpler and more readable programs. The program elements associated with attributes are transformed to more detailed programs by a supporting tool (e.g. preprocessor). For example, a preprocessor may insert a logging program into the methods associated with a \"logging\" attribute.\n\nWith the inclusion of The Metadata Facility for the Java Programming Language (JSR-175) into the J2SE 5.0 release it is possible to utilize attribute-oriented programming right out of the box. \nXDoclet library makes it possible to use attribute-oriented programming approach in earlier versions of Java.\n\nThe C# language has supported attributes from its very first release. However these attributes are used to give run-time information and are not used by a pre-processor (there isn't one in C#'s reference implementation).\n\nThe Unified Modeling Language (UML) supports a kind of attribute named Stereotypes.\n\nThe Hack programming language supports attributes. Attributes can be attached to various program entities, and information about those attributes can be retrieved at run-time via reflection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099606", "title": "Young Latvians", "text": "Young Latvians\n\nNew Latvians () is the term most often applied to the intellectuals of the First Latvian National Awakening (), active from the 1850s to the 1880s. The movement was modeled on the Young Germany () movement led by Heinrich Heine. Originally a derogatory epithet applied to these nationalist intellectuals by their mostly Baltic German opponents, the term \"Young Latvia\" () was first used by Gustav Wilhelm Sigmund Brasche, the pastor of Nīca, in a review of Juris Alunāns' \"Dziesmiņas latviešu valodai pārtulkotas\" (\"Little Songs Translated for the Latvian Language\") in the newspaper \"Das Inland\" in 1856. Asking who could appreciate such literature in Latvian (Alunāns' book was the first major translation of classic foreign poetry into Latvian), Brasche warned that those daring to dream of \"a Young Latvia\" would meet the tragic fate of the boatman in Heine's poem \"Die Lorelei,\" a translation of which appeared in Alunāns' anthology. The New Latvians were also sometimes known as \"Lettophiles\" or \"\"tautībnieki\"\" (\"ethnicists\").\n\nThough the New Latvians can be seen as part of a primarily cultural and literary movement, their cause had significant political ramifications due to the socio-economic conditions then prevailing in Latvia (part of the Russian Empire, it was nonetheless dominated by the Baltic German nobility). 1856 is usually given as the date of the movement's beginning because of the publication of Alunāns' book and the founding of the major Latvian language newspaper \"Mājas Viesis\" which provided a counterpoint to the pro-German newspaper \"Latviešu Avīzes\". Another contemporary and seminal event was the public declaration of nationality by a leader of the movement, Krišjānis Valdemārs; a student at the University of Tartu (then Dorpat) from 1854 to 1858, Valdemārs affixed a \"carte de visite\" to his door that read \"C. Woldemar stud. cam. Latweetis.\" At the time, it was almost unheard of for an educated person to call himself a Latvian; education meant Germanisation, and Valdemārs' act has been compared to Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg in its importance for Latvian nationalism. Just as some scholars consider the posting of the 95 Theses to be apocryphal, Valdemārs' notice can be seen as less dramatic if taken in context. The historian Arveds Švābe noted that Valdemārs denied being a radical in his own writings; the New Latvians had no political program threatening the Baltic Germans until the 1860s; according to Švābe, their political opposition to the prevailing order was crystallized under the influence of the Slavophiles in connection to the reforms of Alexander II of Russia.\n\nValdemārs is seen as the spiritual father of the Awakening. With Alunāns, he led student gatherings while at Tartu and advocated the study of folklore and the founding of marine academies to turn the Latvians and Estonians into seafaring peoples. Krišjānis Barons began collecting dainas under Valdemārs' direct influence, and in 1862 Valdemārs, Alunāns and Barons collaborated in St. Petersburg to publish \"Pēterburgas Avīzes\". The most radical newspaper hitherto published in Latvian, it was closed by the authorities in 1865. From 1867 to 1873, Atis Kronvalds (often known as Kronvaldu Atis) renewed the \"Latvian evenings\" begun by Valdemārs at Tartu. His \"Nationale Bestrebungen\" (1872) can be seen as the manifesto of the New Latvians. Two of their older colleagues included Kaspars Biezbārdis, the first ethnic Latvian philologist, who helped draft petitions to the tsar on the harsh conditions among the Latvian peasantry (for which he was exiled to Kaluga in 1863), and Andrejs Spāģis, the first writer to draw western European attention to the Baltic problem. Fricis Brīvzemnieks (Treuland) is considered the father of Latvian folkloristics; Barons later made the collection of \"dainas\" his life's work. The poet Auseklis (the nom de plume of Krogzemju Mikus), in the diplomat and scholar Arnolds Spekke's words, represented \"the romantic and mystic search for the nation's soul.\" The Young Latvian Andrejs Pumpurs later penned the national epic Lāčplēsis, \"The Bear Slayer.\"\n\nDefining the movement in retrospect in 1889, Pumpurs wrote: \"Those in the grouping that for twenty-five years fought for freedom were called the New Latvians. Their fate was almost always the same. Without a homeland, their people devoid of rights, without goods or sustenance, often without lodging and without bread, they were doomed to wandering. All doors were locked before them, and they were prevented from finding residences or jobs. With a heavy heart they left their beloved homeland and went abroad, into the interior of Russia, searching for sustenance and at the same time gathering knowledge.\" \n\nIn fact, close to half of the ethnic Latvians who received a higher education were forced to seek work in Russia. As Švābe saw it: \"With their selfish and shortsighted politics, the [Baltic] German aristocracy and bourgeoisie pressure Latvians into Russophilia.\" Even Baltic German intellectuals devoted to the study of the Latvian culture and language, like August Johann Gottfried Bielenstein (the editor of \"Latviešu Avīzes\"), opposed the New Latvians -- whilst the editor of \"Die Zeitung für Stadt und Land\" declared that \"to be educated and Latvian is impossible -- an educated Latvian is a nothing\" (\"\"sei ein Unding\"\"). Pastor Brasche, writing that there is no Latvian nation and that the Latvian people have no past, suggested replacing \"New Latvians\" with the term \"New Peasants\" (\"\"Jung-Bauernstand\"\"). The foremost Lutheran publication declared that Latvians had been a nation in the 13th century but had since been reduced to a peasant class; did every class require its own language? \"The Latvian must die.\" Ethnic Latvian supporters of the Baltic Germans came to be known as \"Old Latvians\"; partly because many of the New Latvians' opponents were associated with the Lutheran church, the movement also had a pronounced anti-clerical character. \n\nThough one stream of the National Awakening was at first centered in Tartu, moved to St. Petersburg, and later shifted to Moscow, in the late 1860s Lettophiles finally succeeded in establishing themselves in Latvia, by founding a relief fund for victims of the famine in Estonia and Finland in 1867 and receiving permission to establish the Riga Latvian Association a year later. Similar associations followed in other towns, the Rīga original receiving the hypocorisma \"mommy\" (\"māmuļa\"). The Rīga Latvian Association staged the first Latvian play, held the first conference of Latvian teachers, and organized the first Latvian song festival in 1873. \n\nValdemārs engaged in polemics with Keuchel (the author of \"\"sei ein Unding\"\"), penning \"Nationale Bestrebungen\" in German as a response to his critics.

She served as a Member of Parliament from 1973 to 1989, representing the county of Nordland, as the first parliamentary leader of the Socialist Left Party from 1977 to 1989. She was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1991 to 2002, and served as the committee's vice chair from 1993 to 1998. During her term on the Nobel committee, she participated in the decisions to award the Nobel Peace Prize to individuals such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat and Kofi Annan. She worked for the thoroughly nazified German Red Cross in the ending years of the Second World War, and she was convicted for treason following her repatriation to Norway in 1947.\n\nBy profession, she was a teacher.\n\nHanna Kvanmo grew up in a working-class family in the Norwegian town Harstad. Her father was a fisherman and her mother was a factory worker. Her parents were divorced, and she was brought up mostly by her mother.\n\nAs an 18-year-old (in 1944), Kvanmo joined the German Red Cross as a nursing student. She was stationed for some time on the Eastern Front, and in the last days of the war, she worked as a practical nurse in Berlin. After the German defeat, she was interned in the British sector of Germany; she was returned to Norway in late 1947 where she was tried and convicted for treason. She received an 8-month prison sentence and a ten-year suspension of her rights as a citizen; the prison sentence was suspended after an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter several years as a single mother working as a cleaning lady and cook, she married and passed the university entrance exam (examen artium) with distinction and worked as a gymnasium teacher at Rana Gymnasium from 1962 to 1973.\n\nKvanmo joined local politics in Rana, and in 1973 she was elected to the Storting, representing the Socialist Left Party (SV). From 1977 she served as the parliamentary leader for the party. In 1975 and 1981 she was also a delegate to the UN general assembly. From 1985-1989, her \"vararepresentant\" was Asle Amundsen. She retired from parliament in 1989. From 1991 to 2002, she was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, serving as the committee's vice chairman 1993-1998.\n\nHer activities during the war were often questioned later in her political career in the Socialist Left Party. She described her perspective and her reasons for joining the German war effort in a book in 1990. The book sold approximately 83,000 copies in Norway, and was considered a best-seller.\n\nKvanmo was an opponent of the EU. After her retiring from parliament she moved with her husband to southern Norway and the town of Arendal.\n\nShe was highly critical of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for their efforts of negotiating Israeli-Egyptian peace in the late 1970s. The Socialist Left Party, with Hanna Kvanmo as its leader, was the only party in the Norwegian Parliament that advocated recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1980s. She later wished to withdraw the Peace Prize awarded to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.\n\n\n"}

At the 2010 census, its population was 3,340,841 of whom 767,920 lived in the built-up urban districts of Maojian and Zhangwan on . In 2007, the city was named China's top ten livable cities by Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum.\n\nThe Wudang Mountains run approximately east–west through the territory of the \"Prefecture-level city\" of Shiyan, crossing several of its county-level divisions. The peak commonly referred to as \"Wudang Mountain\", or in Mandarin Wudangshan, is one of the most important cultural centres of the Taoist faith. The surrounding areas are dotted with up to 200 Taoist monastic temples and religious sites. The main attraction in this area, and also one of the most sacred Taoist sites, which forms an important stop for mainly Chinese tourists bound there, with up to twenty bus loads of visitors per day at peak times is Wudangshan \"Jiedao\" of the Danjiangkou county-level city.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Shiyan administers 8 county-level divisions, including 3 districts, 1 county-level city and 4 counties.\n\nThe main urban area of the prefecture-level city of Shiyan is in Maojian District; it is typically labeled on maps simply as \"Shiyan\".\n\nThis area is subject to major change as part of the South to North water diversion project of the Han River. Certain areas will see an increase of up to 5 meters in water level to create a new reservoir to serve Beijing and Tianjin as a part of this major water diversion project.\n\nShiyan is one of the most important centers of automobile industry in China, with Dongfeng, the premier Chinese truck, bus, and heavy goods vehicle as a major employer. given this focus on automobile manufacture.\n\nBefore 1949, it was a small village, which grew after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1967, teams of workers and engineers were first sent to Shiyan in order to survey sites for automotive plants and factories as part of the Third Front Construction plan. At this time, the population of Shiyan was only a few hundred. Chairman Mao chose Shiyan as the site for China's automobile industry because the surrounding mountains and relative inaccessibility could act as a barrier against foreign attacks.\n\nShiyan is located on the Xiangyu Railway between Xiangyang and Chongqing.

It stars Sean Connery, Harry Andrews, Ian Bannen, Ossie Davis, Ian Hendry, Alfred Lynch, Roy Kinnear and Michael Redgrave.\n\nIn a British Army \"glasshouse\" (military prison) in the Libyan desert, prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination, being drunk while on duty, going AWOL or petty theft etc. are subjected to repetitive drill routines as a punishment in the blazing desert heat.\n\nThe arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies, a power struggle erupts between brutal Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry), humane Staff Sergeant Harris (Ian Bannen), Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews) and the camp's medical officer (Michael Redgrave) as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles.\n\nRoberts (Sean Connery) is a former squadron sergeant major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his commanding officer - which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams's brutality and serves as challenge to his authority. The RSM is a career soldier, powerful within the prison in which he is working, but realistic, \"No one's going to pin a medal on us\". However, he sees his duty to be as important as any other - that of breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again, in his words, \"Into men!\"\n\nStaff Sergeant Williams is new to the prison, and his ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. When Roberts is accused of cowardice, he asks Staff Sergeant Williams, \"And what are you supposed to be - a brave man in a permanent base job?\" The RSM also questions Staff Sergeant Williams's motives for getting out of London, as in another scene, he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK (including the civilian prison Williams worked at) just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Williams openly admits that he is trying to impress the RSM by showing that he has got what it takes to do the job, and attempts to undermine the RSM with a late night drinking contest.\n\nStaff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathises with the men, too closely, according to the RSM. The officers, both the CO (Norman Bird) and the medical officer, take their duties casually and, as Roberts points out, \"everyone is doing time here, even the screws\" (prison officers).\n\nIn the finale, the camp's medical officer and Staff Sergeant Harris decide to report the abuses at the camp. Sadistic Staff Sergeant Williams goes to administer one final, perhaps fatal, beating to Roberts, when two prisoners intervene and appear to attack and very severely beat Williams. Roberts pleads with them to stop, knowing that if the prisoners beat up a prison officer, then any case they may have had against them is hopelessly lost, they are still prisoners, and the prison staff have a much stronger hand to inflict whatever cruelty they now wish to.\n\nThe film was based on a screenplay by Ray Rigby, who wrote for TV and had spent time in military prison. Movie rights were bought by Seven Arts Productions, which had a production deal with MGM. Producer Kenneth Hyman arranged for Rigby's script to be rewritten by other people, but when Sidney Lumet came on board as director, Lumet went back to Rigby's original draft. He and Rigby did cut out around 100 pages of material before filming.\n\n\"There really isn't a lot of story,\" said Lumet. \"It's all character - a group of men, prisoners and jailers alike, driven by the same motive force, fear.\"\n\nSean Connery agreed to play the lead because it represented such a change of pace from James Bond. \"It is only because of my reputation as Bond that the backers put up the money for \"The Hill\",\" he said.\n\nLumet says he told Connery before filming began that, \"'I'm going to make brutal demands of you, physically and emotionally', and he knew I'm not a director who has too much respect for 'stars' as such. The result is beyond my hopes. He is real and tough and not at all smooth or nice. In a way he's a 'heavy' but the real heavy is the Army.\"\n\nFilming took place in Almeria, Spain starting 8 September 1964. An old Spanish fort in Málaga was used for the prison. Many people associated with the production had regarded the filming as pleasant, despite difficult conditions: Temperatures went above 46 °C (114 °F) and nearly all the cast and crew became ill, even though thousands of gallons of fresh water were brought in.\n\nThe Hill did not perform well in cinemas, although it received excellent reviews and Ray Rigby's screenplay won at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nRigby published a novel of the story in 1965.\n\n\nThe film screened at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\"The Hill\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on 5 June 2007 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.\n\n"}

{"id": "2099632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099632", "title": "Sperm heteromorphism", "text": "Sperm heteromorphism\n\nSperm heteromorphism is the simultaneous production of two or more distinguishable types of sperm by a single male. The sperm types might differ in size, shape and/or chromosome complement. Sperm heteromorphism is also called sperm polymorphism or sperm dimorphism (for species with two sperm types). Typically, only one sperm type is capable of fertilizing eggs. Fertile types have been called \"eusperm\" or \"eupyrene sperm\" and infertile types \"parasperm\" or \"apyrene sperm\".\n\nOne interpretation of sperm polymorphism is the \"kamikaze sperm\" hypothesis (Baker and Bellis, 1988), which has been widely discredited in humans. The kamikaze sperm hypothesis states that the polymorphism of sperm is due to a subdivision of sperm into different functional groups. There are those that defend the egg from fertilization by other male sperm, and those that fertilize the egg. However, there is no evidence that the polymorphism of human sperm is for the purpose of antagonizing rival sperm.\n\nSperm heteromorphism is known from several different groups of animals.\n\n\n\n\nThe non-fertilising morph(s) have no function, and are simply developmental errors. This is thought to be unlikely in many sperm heteromorphic species because the production of infertile sperm may be highly regulated, and infertile sperm can make up >90% of the total sperm in some Lepidoptera and \"Drosophila\".\n\nThe non-fertilising morph(s) are a means in which males can provide nutrition to the female, her eggs or the fertilising sperm.\n\nThe non-fertilising sperm help the fertilising sperm by assisting their transport or capacitation (i.e. the acquisition of fertilisation competence). This has been demonstrated in \"Bombyx mori.\"\n\nIn silkworms, there is good evidence that fertile sperm are unable to fertilise if the non-fertile sperm are not present. The researchers artificially inseminated fertile sperm, non-fertile sperm or a mixture of both. Only the last group resulted in offspring production.\n\nNon-fertile sperm increase the fertilisation success of the male producing them when sperm competition occurs. This might be offensive (e.g. displacing or even killing rival fertilising sperm) or defensive (e.g. by blocking areas of the female tract or creating a hostile pre-fertilisation environment).\n\nNon-fertile sperm delay or prevent the female mating again, thus allowing the male producing the non-fertile sperm a greater share of the paternity of her offspring (because the male avoids Sperm competition). For example, sperm might fill up the sperm storage organs so that female \"perceives\" that she does not need to re-mate to obtain more sperm. Alternatively, the sperm may transfer chemicals similar to sex peptide, a chemical carried on the sperm of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" that makes females less likely to accept mates (i.e. it is an anti-aphrodesiac).\n\nThere is correlational evidence for this theory in a butterfly, \"Pieris napi\". Females that were receptive to a second mating had fewer of the non-fertile sperm type in storage than did non-receptive females. Thus, the infertile sperm may be responsible for delaying female remating.\n\nThis theory was also tested in the fruit-fly \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\", but the results suggested that \"cheap filler\" was not important in that species.\n\n"}

It has become one of the best-selling statistics books in history, with over one and a half million copies sold in the English-language edition. It has also been widely translated.\n\nThemes of the book include \"Correlation does not imply causation\" and \"Using random sampling\". It also shows how statistical graphs can be used to distort reality, for example by truncating the bottom of a line or bar chart, so that differences seem larger than they are, or by representing one-dimensional quantities on a pictogram by two- or three-dimensional objects to compare their sizes, so that the reader forgets that the images do not scale the same way the quantities do.\n\nThe original edition contained illustrations by artist Irving Geis. In a UK edition, these were replaced with cartoons by Mel Calman.\n\nIn the 1960s Huff was funded by the tobacco industry to produce a follow-up book titled \"How to Lie with Smoking Statistics\" that attempted to use statistical arguments to undermine claims that smoking was harmful to health.

The village contains approximately 2,200 dwellings and is approximately in length, measured from east to west. The population of the civil parish was 5,169 at the 2001 census, increasing to 5,637 at the 2011 census.\n\nRuskington is approximately to the north of Sleaford, from Newark and Grantham, and from Boston and Lincoln, with a flat landscape. The \"Spires and Steeples Trail\" passes north-south through the village, following the River Slea into Sleaford. The High Street is split into two parts, High Street North and High Street South, by The Beck, a brook that flows from Bloxholm west of the village before merging into the Slea at Haverholme Park. A large number of Mallard ducks inhabit the Beck and surrounding gardens.\n\nRoxholm is to the west of the civil parish, and the boundary passes south of Roxholm Grange. On the road to Dunsby it meets Brauncewell, passes eastward through Cottage Farm, crossing the road to Bloxholm, then crossing the B1188, Lincoln Road, north of the village, where it meets Dorrington, skirting the northern edge of the village.\n\nThe border crosses the railway south of Cedar Farm (in Dorrington), then follows to the south of the road from Dorrington out onto the fens (Ruskington Fen). At Sylcote, it meets North Kyme, following Farroway Drain to the south at Ruskington Dales. It then follows Anwick Bank westward, where it meets Anwick to the south. At Highfield, it follows the Anwick road to the south, crossing the A153. North of Haverholme Priory (outside the parish), meeting Ewerby and Evedon at the River Slea, which it follows for over to the west, before meeting Leasingham. It follows the northern edge of the wood westward along a tributary of the River Slea, then follows parallel to the A153 westward to the south. It crosses the A153 south of the 400 kV pylons, before meeting Roxholm at a copse north of Rigg Farm.\n\nRuskington was recorded in the \"Domesday Book\" as \"Rischintone\" (\"farmstead where rushes grow\", OE *ryscen (with Scand. -sk-) + tūn.)\n\nThe remains of a Roman road also run parallel and to the west of Lincoln Road, but are apparent only in aerial photographs. Ruskington's Anglo-Saxon burial ground is situated on Lincoln Road near Mill House. At the time of the \"Domesday Book\", it was part of the ancient Flaxwell \"wapentake\" (a collection of local parishes).\n\nPolicing in Sleaford falls under the responsibility of the Lincolnshire Police, and fire-fighting under the responsibility of the Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nThe medical centre is situated in Brookside Close. There is a dental surgery on High Street North, and an optician on High Street South. Brookside Close has a veterinary surgery, with another vet's surgery on High Street North. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) operates a station on Kesteven Street, Sleaford. The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides services at three main hospitals in the county, Pilgrim Hospital (Boston), Grantham and District Hospital, and Lincoln County Hospital, all of which run 24-hour accident and emergency departments as of January 2015.\n\nThe main employer in Ruskington is Tulip, a division of Danish Crown (previously \"George Adams\"), a pork products factory which originally produced primarily sausages and pork pies. Tulip's Ruskington site now produces fried crumbed products like Scotch eggs and cocktail sausages. It was the manufacturer of Spam fritters and Wicked Pigs, but these products have been discontinued. Stores and local shops provide other employment.\n\nThe B1188 road runs through the village, terminating south of the village, at Speedway Corner. A railway station, which originally opened on 1 August 1882, and reopened on 5 May 1975, is on the Peterborough to Lincoln Line. Passenger trains do not run on Sundays. Ruskington is on a bus route between Sleaford and Lincoln, and a local bus operating company, Phillips of Ruskington, operates the local school buses.\n\nRuskington has two primary schools: Ruskington Winchelsea Primary School and Chestnut Street Church of England Primary School. Winchelsea was judged to be at a \"good\" standard when it was inspected by Ofsted in 2013; at which time it had 156 pupils on roll. Chestnut Street School converted to an Academy in 2012; at its latest Ofsted inspection (2013), it had 293 pupils on roll and was judged to be at a \"good\" standard.\n\nA national school was opened in 1868 to house 120 children and was not provided for by local rates under the Education Act 1902. In 1878, the Ruskington School was established and erected a school two years later; in 1903, the Board was abolished and the school became Ruskington Infants' Council School, provided for by local rates; in or about 1947 it was renamed Ruskington County School. The Winchelsea School replaced it, opening in 1974 and moving to its current, purpose-built site in 1992.\n\nThe nearby town of Sleaford has three secondary schools, each of which were rated \"good\" standard at their latest Ofsted inspections: Carre's Grammar School (male grammar school), Kesteven and Sleaford High School Selective Academy (female grammar school) and St George's Academy (mixed non-selective secondary school). The grammar schools are based in Sleaford, but St George's operates across two sites (one at Sleaford, the other at Ruskington) where pupils are educated separately; the Sixth Form, however, is based solely at Sleaford. The school had 2247 pupils on roll in 2012, across both sites and including the Sixth Form. The grammar schools require students to sit the eleven-plus test and achieve a minimum score before applying; providing they fall within the catchment area, applicants are then given priority based on home location in the event of a tie. St George's is not selective, but gives priority based on home location in the event of it being over-subscribed.\n\nIn 1957, Ruskington County Secondary Modern School was officially opened. Renamed Coteland's Community School by 1999, the school was under-performing by the 1990s: closure was being considered in 1994 and, in 1997, the school's GCSE performances were ranked second-lowest in the country; however, under the guidance of headteacher David Veal (1994−2007), the school was recognised as one of the most improved schools in the country in 2000 and received a School Achievement Award for its progress between 2000 and 2002. In April 2007, a plan to merge St George's College of Technology in Sleaford with Lafford High School, Billinghay, and Aveland High School, Billingborough was announced; Coteland's was invited to join. After Veal's retirement in 2007, the Governors opted in and the school became part of the federation; in 2010, the Government authorised a scheme to merge St George's, Aveland and Coteland's into a single Academy.\n\nThe village is served by several churches. The Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints is at the west end of the High Street. The Norman church was built in 1086 to replace an earlier, Anglo Saxon wooden structure. Parts of the tower are believed to date from 1086, but the chancel portion was built in the 13th–14th century. The tower was damaged in 1618 and rebuilt in 1620.\n\nOther churches include the Ruskington Methodist Church, South Lincs Church (a Pentecostal church formerly known as Emmanuel Christian Centre) and the Ruskington Free Church.\n\nThe village has a bowls club and a junior football team called the Ruskington Lions. The Ruskington Lions girls' team is now entering a newly founded Lincolnshire County Intermediate Women's Football League. The village hall hosts a dance school on Saturdays, and another dance school is located on Brookside Close near the doctors' surgery.\n\nThere are three pubs, the Shoulder of Mutton Inn on Church Street, the Red Lion on High Street North and the Black Bull on Rectory Road. Potters Restaurant on Chestnut Street is now closed.\n\nRuskington's High Street North has a co-op (including a pharmacy and sub-post office), an optician, farm shop, three charity shops, a carpet shop, three barbers, a number of ladies hairdressers, two tea and coffee shops, a florist, five take-aways (one Indian, one kebab and three Chinese), a Chinese restaurant, and two fish and chip shops, one with a restaurant. Church Street has a card shop, a butcher-cum-baker, and a butchers' cash-and-carry factory shop. There is a pet supply outlet and a general supply with hardware shop on Manor Street, and two news agents, a building society-cum-estate agent, a computer shop, and a garden centre on Newton Lane. Priory Road has another farm shop, and Rectory Road has a petrol station-cum-garage (which includes Spar retailing). The village hall is off Parkfield Road.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099657", "title": "Electro-Harmonix", "text": "Electro-Harmonix\n\nElectro-Harmonix is a New York-based company that makes high-end electronic audio processors and sells rebranded vacuum tubes. The company was founded by Mike Matthews in 1968. It is best known for a series of popular guitar effects pedals introduced in the 1970s and 1990s. Unknown to most people, EH also made a line of guitars in the 70's.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s Electro-Harmonix established itself as a pioneer and leading manufacturer of guitar effects pedals. Electro-Harmonix was the first company to introduce, manufacture, and market affordable state-of-the art \"stomp-boxes\" for guitarist and bassists, such as the first stomp-box flanger (Electric Mistress), the first analog echo/delay unit with no moving parts (Memory Man), the first guitar synthesizer in pedal form (Micro Synthesizer), and the first tube-amp distortion simulator (Hot Tubes). In 1980, Electro-Harmonix also designed and marketed one of the first digital delay/looper pedals (16-Second Digital Delay) and a line of guitars in the 70's.\n\nElectro-Harmonix was founded by rhythm and blues keyboard player Mike Matthews in October 1968 in New York City with $1,000. He took a job as a salesman for IBM in 1967, but shortly afterwards, in partnership with Bill Berko, an audio repairman who claimed to have his own custom circuit for a fuzz pedal, he jobbed construction of the new pedal to a contracting house and began distributing the pedals under a deal with the Guild Guitar Company. Fuzzboxes were in demand following a trail of hits involving their sound, including \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by The Rolling Stones two years before, and recent popularization of Jimi Hendrix. The latter connection resulted in the pedals being branded the 'Foxey Lady'. In addition several low priced models of acoustic guitars were sold.\n\nFollowing the departure of his partner, Matthews was introduced to inventor and electric engineer Robert Myer through IBM colleagues. Together they designed a circuit to create a distortion-free sustain. A simple line booster used by Myers in testing to preamplify the guitar's signal was also manufactured from 1969 as the Linear Power Booster (LPB-1), and has continued production in present day.\n\nThe Axis fuzz pedal, also sold under the name 'Foxey Lady' for the Guild guitar company, and LPB-1 Linear Power Booster were the first products in 1969. The LPB-1 massively boosted a guitar signal & could be used to overdrive an amplifier, resulting in a raw distorted sound, full of sustain and harmonics. Several similar devices, which sold well, followed, such as the Treble Booster and Bass Booster.\nThe Mike Matthews Freedom Amp, a portable guitar amp powered by 40 \"D\" batteries, was popular in many venues that lacked an A/C power source.\n\nElectro-Harmonix stopped making pedals in the mid-1980s, and in the early 1990s started selling vacuum tubes re-branded with its name for guitar amplifiers, which it had also been making since the 1970s. However, due to demand and the high prices guitarists were paying for old 1970s pedals on the vintage market, it reissued the more popular old pedals in the mid-1990s, including the Big Muff Pi and Small Stone. In 2002 it started designing new pedals to add to its range. Company policy was that all reissued effects remained as close as possible to the original, vintage designs; however, casings, knobs and especially the old-fashioned mini-jack power plug were not up to later standards. In 2006 the smaller and more standardized \"micro\" and \"nano\" effect lines using surface-mount circuit components were introduced. Circuit board manufacture was outsourced, and the pedals assembled in New York.\n\n Electro-Harmonix produces pedals with many different types of sound manipulation suitable for guitar, bass, vocal, keyboard, and other instruments. It also sells rebranded vacuum tubes carrying the Electro-Harmonix brand name.\n\nIn 1969 Bob Myer and Mike Matthews designed the Big Muff Pi, a fuzzbox that added a bass-heavy sustain to any guitar sound. It is described by the company as \"the finest harmonic distortion-sustain device developed to date\". Originally this was intended to be a pedal that would mimic the fuzz tones of Jimi Hendrix and other guitarists at the time, but the result was a mix of a fuzz and distortion pedal with a very heavy sound. It also made small amps sound much better and allowed distortion at any volume.\n\nThe pedal sold well and was used by Carlos Santana, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Alex Lifeson of Rush and, later, Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and in the 1990s KoRn's rhythm guitarist Munky, Vicente Freitas, Jack White of The White Stripes, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., The Edge of U2, and Billy Corgan (on The Smashing Pumpkins landmark album, \"Siamese Dream\"). The band Mudhoney titled their debut EP \"Superfuzz Bigmuff\".\n\nAlthough the first Big Muff production date was for many years cited as 1971, the first version of the Big Muff was actually sold in 1969 as a hand-made \"perf board\" version. A production version with an etched PCB board was made in early 1970. Mike Matthews was friends with Jimi Hendrix and claims Jimi bought one from Manny's Music in New York, shortly after they were released and had one in the Electric Lady Studios shortly before Jimi's death in 1970. Several variations of the Big Muff Pi followed throughout the 1970s. Electro-Harmonix produced a reissue assembled in New York City; until 2009 it produced a version made by Sovtek in Russia which provided a slightly different tone. The Bass Big Muff replaced the Russian version.\n\nSeveral other variations (some of which are not actually Big Muffs) of the pedal were in production , including the Metal Muff (intended to achieve the higher gain Metal guitar sound), the Double Muff, which incorporates the original Muff Fuzz circuit, twice in series with a single overdrive control for each circuit, providing the user either with a cascaded 'Double Muff' sound or the original Muff Fuzz circuit, the Little Big Muff, a smaller version, and a variation in circuit, of the NYC Big Muff, which produces yet another variation in sound, and the Big Muff with Tone Wicker, which is similar to the 2008 revision NYC Big Muff, with two added features: a tone bypass switch allowing you to bypass the tone control and a switch that adjusts the frequency of three high frequency filters in the circuit.\n\nIn 2018, Electro-Harmonix released three vintage Big Muff re-issues the Green Russian Big Muff, the Op-Amp Big Muff, and the Triangle Big Muff, and in early 2020 the Ram’s Head Big Muff was reissued.\n\nElectro-Harmonix often produces a range of pedals based on a single effect, and then combines two or more into higher end units. For instance, the Epitome combines the MIcro POG, Stereo Electric Mistress, and Holy Grail Plus into one effect unit.\n\nThe widely used Small Stone phase shifter is a 4-stage phaser designed by David Cockerell, whom Electro-Harmonix hired from his former employer EMS. The phased sounds of French composer Jean-Michel Jarre depended heavily on the Small Stone unit. It was reissued years later by EHX and a smaller version of the pedal was eventually introduced in a 'Nano' casing (officially called the \"Small Stone (Nano Chassis)\").\n\nThe Small Clone chorus is a very popular chorus pedal, used by Kurt Cobain, both live and in studio. Like the Small Stone, it is issued in both the standard size and two different smaller versions (the Nano Clone is based on the Clone Theory circuit, while the neo clone is the standard).\n\nThe Electric Mistress is an analog flanger. It had first been sold in 1976 and was by that the first flanger in pedal format. The Deluxe version has been reissued and is still in production, although in 2015, a new Deluxe Electric Mistress was introduced in the company's smaller \"XO\" casing. As well, there are two digital recreations called NEO Mistress and Stereo Electric Mistress. Except for the very first blue/red version the Electric Mistress featured a \"Filter Matrix mode\" which allowed the user to freeze it at any point in the flange, offering distinctive chime-like tones. On the Neo and Stereo Mistress, this is achieved at a certain setting on the \"rate\" knob. Notable users include David Gilmour, Todd Rundgren, Alex Lifeson, Robin Trower, Andy Summers of The Police, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante.\n\nThe Flanger Hoax pedal is a more advanced unit, allowing further control of the various parameters of phaser, flanger and chorusing effects.\n\nThe Polychorus allows highly adjustable chorus, flanger, filter matrix, and slapback echo effects. Notable users include Cobain (i.e. \"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\"), Adrian Belew, and more recently Ryan Jarman of The Cribs.\n\nElectro-Harmonix's 'XO' line added the Stereo Polyphase, an analog optical envelope- and LFO-controlled phase shifter.\n\nElectro-Harmonix also manufactures delay pedals, including the Deluxe Memory Man, Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai, and #1 Echo. They also produce the '2880' pedal, which allows complex looping and multi-track overdubbing. The #1 Echo provides basic digital echo capability, while the Deluxe Memory Man provides more control over length, repeats, etc. The Deluxe Memory Man also includes built-in chorusing and vibrato effects. The digital Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai (distinct from the Analog Deluxe Memory Man) also includes reverse echo effect and looping/overdubbing. The Memory Toy and Memory Boy delay pedals are essentially smaller budget versions of the Deluxe Memory Man. The Memory Man effects pedal was used by Edge from the band U2 to record the songs \"I Will Follow\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". One of the singles from the band Deerhunter's 2010 album Halcyon Digest was named \"Memory Boy\".\n\nThe Holy Grail, Holy Grail Plus, Holier Grail (discontinued), Holiest Grail (discontinued), Oceans 11, and Cathedral pedals produce reverberation. These cover a range of capability, including reverb length, room simulation, etc. The company's Holy Stain multi-effects pedal also includes two different types of reverb.\n\nTremolo and vibrato are included as well, in both solid-state and vacuum tube options. These are available in the Stereo Pulsar (solid-state) and Wiggler (tube) pedals.\n\nAlso available are a series of pitch modulation pedals. These include the Micro Synthesizer (for bass or guitar), HOG (Harmonic Octave Generator), POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator, released in 2005), POG 2 (2009), Micro POG (in an XO casing), Nano POG, Octave Multiplexer, and Pitch Fork.\n\nThe POG line of pedals has been used extensively by several prominent 2000s-era rock guitarists, including Jack White (of The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, etc.), and Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures, etc.).\n\nElectro-Harmonix offers several pedals for envelope/equalization modulation. Amongst them are the Bassballs (appropriately named for its intended use with bass guitars), Doctor Q and the Q-Tron. Another pedal of note was the vacuum tube-powered Black Finger Compressor which adds distortion-free sustain to the sound and which appeared in the mid 1970s. The solid-state White Finger followed.\n\nIn 1995, Electro-Harmonix owner Mike Matthews commissioned Mike Beigel, former owner of Musitronics Corp. and inventor of the Mu-tron III envelope filter, to design a new envelope filter using the same analog circuitry as the original Mu-tron III, thus keeping the sound as close to the original as possible while adding new features to bring the effect into the new millennium. The pedal featured the same controls as the Mu-tron III and incorporated a \"Boost\" feature, which activates an internal pre-amp and changes the function of the gain knob giving the Q-Tron a sound almost identical to the Mu-tron III. Another feature added to Q-Tron was an effects loop switch and attack response switch. Units with these features are called the Q-Tron+. A smaller more compact version, the Mini Q-Tron, is also available, as well as an even smaller version, the Micro Q-Tron. Electro-Harmonix also currently produces a modulated envelope filter, the Blurst\n\nElectro-Harmonix currently manufactures over one hundred other pedals.\n\nThese include the Graphic Fuzz (a fuzzbox which includes an EQ section), the Frequency Analyzer (which creates ring modulation) and the Voice Box, a vocoder. The Voice Box has been included in a series of demonstration videos produced by Jack Conte.\n\nElectro-Harmonix has also made a few small power amp pedals for use as a simple guitar amplifier. The EHX 22 Caliber was a 22 watt solid state pedal capable of driving either an 8 ohm or 16 ohm speaker cabinet. It has been discontinued. The 22 Caliber was replaced in the lineup by the EHX 44 Magnum, a similar pedal capable of driving the same speaker load, but at a 44 watt output.\n\nSeveral pedals produced in the decades prior have also been discontinued, many of which are still in high demand for their unique sound.\n\nThese guitars were only available from EH for a very short time in 1974. They were available through a special offer for $87.50 with the purchase of $50 or more in certain scratch-n-dent EH products. The list price was $187.50. They didn't buy out a warehouse and put their name on them. These are the model names and descriptions: EH-7010 EH acoustic guitar (mahogany back and sides), EH-7020 EH acoustic guitar (D-28 copy, rosewood back and sides), and EH-7030 EH acoustic guitar (D-41 copy, rosewood back and sides, pearloid binding and inlay, 3 piece back).\nThey bought them from Moridaira/ Morris Guitar who at the time were the best guitar maker in Japan, making guitars for Fender and many big companies. \nThey put the EH on the guitars. The guitar, marked with the brand \"Brody\" is another Japanese-made acoustic that EH had made for them in the 70's. Mike Matthews has stated that Brody was his mother's maiden name. Unlike the other EH guitar, this one is of a lesser quality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099676", "title": "Sitt al-Mulk", "text": "Sitt al-Mulk\n\nSitt al-Mulk (; 970–1023), was a Fatimid princess. After the disappearance of her half-brother, the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, in 1021, she was instrumental in securing the succession of her nephew Ali az-Zahir, and acted as the \"de facto\" ruler of the state until her death on 5 February 1023.\n\nShe was born in September/October 970 at the palace-city of al-Mansuriya in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia), to the prince Nizar—the future fifth Fatimid imam–caliph al-Aziz Billah (). Her mother was an unnamed concubine (\"umm walad\"), who is most likely to be identified with the \"al-Sayyida al-Aziziyya\" (\"the Lady of al-Aziz\") who is frequently mentioned in the sources. She was a Melkite Christian, most likely of Byzantine Greek origin, possibly of the provincial aristocracy of Sicily who were captured in the wars against the Byzantines there sometime before 965. It is known that al-Sayyida al-Aziziyya refused to convert to Islam. Al-Aziz's love for her was great, but scandalized pious Muslim opinion, especially at a time when al-Aziz was at war with the Byzantines in Syria; and reportedly caused suspicion that she was behind his tolerance towards Christians and Jews, which went as far as the appointment of a Christian, Isa ibn Nasturus, as vizier. In 986, two of her brothers were appointed to high office in the Melkite Church: Orestes became Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Arsenios was made metropolitan bishop of Fustat, and later Patriarch of Alexandria. It is still debated among modern scholars whether al-Sayyida al-Aziziyya was also the mother of Sitt al-Mulk's younger brother, and al-Aziz's heir and successor, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (), but the evidence appears to be against it. When her mother died in November 995, the historian al-Maqrizi reports, Sitt al-Mulk held vigil at her tomb for one month. From her mother the princess inherited a slave girl, Taqarrub, who became her chief confidante and spy in the palace.\n\nOne year before the birth of Sitt al-Mulk, the Fatimid armies had conquered Egypt. A new capital, Cairo, was built there, and in 973, the Fatimid court moved from Ifriqiya to Egypt to take up residence there. Thus Sitt al-Mulk spent her childhood at the palace of Qasr al-Bahr on the shores of the Nile, and later had her own rooms in the Western Palace at Cairo. \n\nSitt al-Mulk was doted on by her father, and was his favourite daughter. Al-Aziz lavished gifts and wealth on her, and even put a military unit at her disposal. Her wealth allowed her to fund a number of charitable endowments. She was renowned for her beauty, but, following common Fatimid practice, she remained unmarried to avoid dynastic complications. Sitt al-Mulk inherited her father's open-mindedness and tolerance, and, uniquely among Fatimid palace ladies, appears to have been involved in politics. She exercised not a little influence on him during his reign, as seen by the attempt of the Christian vizier Isa ibn Nasturus, when he was dismissed from his post, to regain his post through her intercession (for which he placed 300,000 dinars at her disposal).\n\nCaliph al-Aziz died suddenly at Bilbays on 13 October 996, while preparing an expedition against the Byzantines. His sudden death opened the issue of succession, as the caliph's only surviving son, al-Mansur, was only eleven years old. His half-sister Sitt al-Mulk supported therefore another candidate, an adult son of the prince Abdallah, who had been the first designated heir to Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah () but had died shortly before him, leading to the accession of al-Aziz. According to the Arab chroniclers, she had fallen in love with this otherwise unknown cousin and intended to marry him. The princess reportedly hurried back to Cairo with the senior courtiers and the palace guard to take control of the palace and raise her candidate to the throne, but the eunuch Barjawan, who was al-Mansur's tutor, pre-empted her by putting the crown on the boy's head as soon as news of al-Aziz's death arrived. Al-Mansur thus became caliph with the regnal name of al-Hakim bi Amr Allah, while Sitt al-Mulk was placed under house arrest. \n\nNevertheless, during the early part of al-Hakim's reign, the relations between Sitt al-Mulk and her brother appear to have been normal and even amicable, although not much information survives: in 997, she made him rich gifts, and soon after Barjawan's murder in 1000, which allowed al-Hakim to take over the reins of government himself, he conferred estates with an annual income of 100,000 gold dinars on her. In 1000, al-Hakim even married one of her slave girls. In at least one instance she also intervened to inform her brother, who was rather ignorant of state affairs, of a conspiracy by two senior officials that led to the execution of the vizier Abu'l-Ala Fahd ibn Ibrahim, followed by the extortion of vast sums from tax officials in Palestine. In 1013, she mediated with her brother for a pardon to the Jarrahid chieftain Hassan ibn Mufarrij, who had previously risen in revolt against Fatimid rule in Palestine along with his father, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah.\n\nSoon, however, al-Hakim's reign began to degenerate into terror and arbitrary rule. The state suffered from an increasingly erratic governance, as the Caliph introduced doctrinal innovations, issued a bewildering array of prohibitions ranging from food and singing in public to dogs and baths, launched a persecution of Christians and Jews (culminating in the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009), purged the old guard of officials he had inherited from his father, and even seemed to accept the divine status accorded to him by some of the Isma'ili faithful, who would later found the Druze sect. \n\nAs a result, the two siblings drifted apart. The princess opposed to al-Hakim's intolerant politics, and he was jealous of her, suspecting her of having lovers, including among his generals. The event that most contributed to the rift between the two was connected to the succession: in 1013, al-Hakim chose a cousin, Abd al-Rahman ibn Ilyas, as the designated heir apparent (\"walī ʿahd al-muslimīn\"), violating the line of succession and overturning a century of precedent of excluding the males of the wider dynasty from all affairs of state. Sitt al-Mulk, wealthy and influential, remained committed to the succession of al-Hakim's surviving son Ali, and took him and his mother, the \"umm walad\" Ruqayya, into her palace to shield them from the Caliph. The downfall of al-Hakim's erstwhile favourite Malik ibn Sa'id al-Fariqi in 1014/5 is apparently related to this: Malik, who had been raised to head both the judiciary as chief \"qāḍī\" and of the Isma'ili \"daʿwa\" as chief \"dāʿī\", was accused of being close to her (apparently siding with her over the choice of heir), and was executed.\n\nOn the night of 13 February 1021, her brother the Caliph disappeared during one of his nightly walks in the city, and after a couple of days of search, evidence of his murder was found, and he was declared dead. Of the three contemporary historians to write about these events (and who in turn provided the material for many later historians), the account of Baghdadi chronicler Hilal al-Sabi directly implicates the princess, writing that after Sitt al-Mulk quarreled with her brother over the direction of the state and the future of the dynasty, she began to fear that he would have her killed. She thus approached the Kutama general Ibn Dawwas, whom the Caliph suspected of being one of her lovers, and conspired with him to have al-Hakim killed, which was done by Ibn Dawwas' slaves. Given the fervently anti-Fatimid bias of Hilal, this account is suspect, but the later historians Sibt ibn al-Jawzi and Ibn Taghribirdi, apparently relying on the second contemporary account, that of the Egyptian Shafi'i \"qāḍī\" al-Quda'i, report that she ordered the execution of all those who participated in the conspiracy, thus revealing her own likely involvement in it. On the other hand, Yahya of Antioch, a Christian who had fled al-Hakim's persecution, mentions nothing of Sitt al-Mulk's involvement in al-Hakim's death. Modern scholars are likely divided, with some, such as Yaacov Lev and Fatema Mernissi, considering her participation as probable, and others, such as Heinz Halm, considering it dubious, since there were many other members of the Fatimid establishment, including Ibn Dawwas, who had am interest in removing the erratic caliph. Even Halm admits, however, that the rumours were persistent, and that, as the affair around Malik al-Fariqi shows, al-Hakim did not trust his sister.\n\nFollowing the disappearance of al-Hakim, and before he was declared dead, Sitt al-Mulk moved to establish her own position, distributing money to the court dignitaries and military commanders (according to Hilal, with the aid of Ibn Dawwas). Hilal reports that al-Hakim's son Ali was raised to the throne, with the regnal name al-Zahir, only seven days after al-Hakim's disappearance, but all other sources mention that he was crowned on 27 March, with Sitt al-Mulk as the \"de facto\" ruler of the state in the meantime. All sources agree that she quickly had Ibn Dawwas executed as the one responsible for al-Hakim's death (and perhaps to cover up her own traces). This was followed soon after by al-Hakim's designated heir, Abd al-Rahman ibn Ilyas, who was then serving as governor of Damascus: he was lured back to Egypt, imprisoned, and killed.\n\nThe young caliph had long been under her tutelage during al-Hakim's reign, and remained so for some time after his coronation, which led to tensions with al-Zahir's mother, Ruqayya. During this early period of al-Zahir's reign, Sitt al-Mulk was the effective governor of the state, known in contemporary sources as \"the Princess-Aunt\" (\"al-Sayyida al-ʿamma\") or \"the Princess Aziz\" (\"al-Sayyida al-ʿazīza\"). In this capacity, she began to reverse al-Hakim's decisions, and restore orderly government, by among others cancelling estate grants and salaries that al-Hakim had conferred on his favourites, and restoring the customs duties that he had abolished as un-Islamic. She also reversed her brother's manifold prohibitions, allowing women to leave their homes, and permitting again the listening to music and the drinking of wine. The non-Muslims (\"dhimmīs\") who had been forced to convert to Islam under al-Hakim were allowed to return to their old faith, and those who had fled the country were allowed to return. \n\nHistorian Yaacov Lev points out that she was able to do so as the result of several factors. On the one hand, while women of the Fatimid dynasty were not usually involved in politics, they were \"not secluded from social and economic life\", which not only allowed them contact with the world outside the palace, but also necessitated the supervision of a administrative and financial agents, giving them some experience in such matters. Finally, particularly after the chaos and terror of al-Hakim's last years, the ruling elite was quite prepared to accept direction from her, for they had little left to lose. As Lev writes, in this atmosphere, \"machinations and the readiness to shed blood had become accepted ways of conducting political life, and by these standards, Sitt al-Mulk was a ruler worthy of the name, for she inspired \"[hayba]\" [i.e., awe]\". However, while she was widely praised by medieval chroniclers for both her personal qualities as well as for her sound policies, her position was anomalous, and dependent on the entirely exceptional circumstances. She may have \"de facto\" exercised the functions of a caliph, but it was unthinkable for her to hold power in her own name and claim sovereignty, for example by having her name included in the \"khuṭba\". It is unclear how long her regency lasted; the contemporary official and historian al-Musabbihi indicates that power soon passed to a new circle of officials, and that she lost her influence and died in obscurity, while al-Maqrizi indicates that she maintained her control over state affairs until her death.\n\nShe also severely persecuted the Druze religion, which believed in Al-Hakim's divinity, eliminating it entirely from Egypt, and restricting it to the mountains of Lebanon. She worked to reduce tensions with the Byzantine Empire over the possession of Aleppo, but before negotiations could be completed, she died on 5 February 1023 at the age of fifty-two.\n\nSitt al-Mulk died of dysentery on 5 February 1023.\n\n\n"}

Hammer. It was lying down with the inscription facing downwards, surrounded by five sharp larger stones forming a pentagon or a pentagram. Consequently, the stone has been part of a larger monument like the Björketorp Runestone further east. In 1864, the runestone was moved into the church of Sölvesborg.\n\nMost scholars date the inscription to the 7th century and it is carved with a type of runes that form an intermediate version between the Elder Futhark and the Younger Futhark. A characteristic example of this is the a-rune which has the same form as the h-rune of the younger futhark. This is the rune that is transliterated with A. The k-rune, which looks like a Y is a transition form between and in the two futharks. There are quite few intermediary inscriptions like this one. Three more are known from Blekinge, i.e. the Björketorp Runestone, the Istaby Runestone and the Gummarp Runestone, which were moved to Copenhagen and lost in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728.\n\nThe Stentoften, Istaby Runestone and Gummarp Runestone inscriptions can be identified with the same clan through the names that are mentioned on them, and the names are typical for chieftains. The Björketorp Runestone lacks names and is raised some tens of kilometers from the others. However, it is beyond doubt that the Björketorp runestone is connected to them, because in addition to the special runic forms, the same message is given on the Stentoften Runestone. These runestones are probably not carved by the same person, and so it appears that they reflect a specific runic tradition in the Blekinge area during the 7th century. Runologist Michael Schulte suggests that the archaic text of the Stentoften stone is more effective from a dramatic perspective than the younger and more explicit version on the Björketorp stone.\n\nThe name Hariwulfa is a combination of \"hari\" meaning \"warrior\" and \"wulafa\" \"wolf,\" while the \"haþu\" of Haþuwulfz means \"battle.\" It has been suggested that the assignment of such lycophoric names may have been related to ritualistic practices and religious wolf-symbolism used in the initiation of young warriors. A shortened form of the name Hariwulfa survived into the Viking Age and is attested in the inscription on the Hærulf Runestone.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099701", "title": "Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham", "text": "Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham\n\nAlfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham, PC (18 December 1910 – 27 June 1999), sometimes known as Alf Robens, was an English trade unionist, Labour politician and industrialist. His political ambitions, including an aspiration to become Prime Minister, were frustrated by bad timing; but his energies were diverted into industry: he spent a decade as Chairman of the National Coal Board, and later headed a major inquiry which resulted in the Robens Report on health, safety and welfare at work. His outlook was paternalistic, but in later life, he moved away from his early socialism towards the Conservative Party. His reputation remains tarnished by his failure to have foreseen and prevented the Aberfan disaster, followed by actions widely regarded as insensitive during this disaster's aftermath.\n\nRobens was born in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, the son of George Robens, a cotton salesman and Edith Robens (\"née\" Anderton). He left school aged 15 to work as an errand boy, but his career truly began when he joined the Manchester and Salford Co-operative Society as a clerk; he became a director when he was 22, one of the first worker/directors in the country. He was an official in the Union of Distributive and Allied Workers from 1935 to 1945; being certified medically unfit for military service in the Second World War, he served as a Manchester City Councillor from 1941 to 1945. He married Eva Powell on 9 September 1936; the couple adopted a son, Alfred (born 1935).\n\nFollowing the war, in the dramatic Labour landslide victory of 1945, Robens was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the mining constituency of Wansbeck in Northumberland. He started on a sustained rise through the parliamentary ranks, serving in junior posts at the Ministry of Transport (1945–1947) and at the Ministry of Fuel and Power under Hugh Gaitskell. In 1950, following boundary changes, Robens moved to the new constituency of Blyth, later Blyth Valley. He was briefly Minister of Labour and National Service in 1951, but the Conservative Party won the general election later that year.\n\nIn opposition, Robens continued to rise in the party, being appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary by Clement Attlee while Aneurin Bevan was indisposed, and he began to be considered as a future candidate for party leader. Robens himself \"yearned to become Prime Minister\". However, he failed to impress during the Suez Crisis of 1956 because he had been briefed in confidence by the Conservative Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, on the night before the invasion; sworn to secrecy, he was unable to oppose the invasion effectively in the debate in the House of Commons. Furthermore, party leader Gaitskell felt him too left-wing. He was replaced as Shadow Foreign Secretary by Bevan, and felt that his political ambitions had been frustrated. Thus, when Harold Macmillan (Eden's successor as Prime Minister) offered Robens the chairmanship of the National Coal Board (NCB) in 1960, he accepted enthusiastically. Gaitskell died in January 1963. Geoffrey Tweedale, writing in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", has expressed the view that, had Robens persisted in politics, he, rather than Harold Wilson, would likely have become Prime Minister. Indeed, George Brown (the runner-up to Wilson in the election to succeed Gaitskell) stated in his autobiography that had Robens been in Parliament he himself would not have opposed him, and even if he had, Robens would have defeated him.\n\nRobens took up his appointment at the NCB in 1961 at a salary believed to be £10,000 a year (which was never increased throughout his ten years in office) and was created a life peer as Baron Robens of Woldingham, of Woldingham in the County of Surrey, on 28 June. Amongst those critical of this sudden elevation were his successor as MP for Blyth, Eddie Milne. Robens' leadership of the NCB was high-handed. He expected unflinching loyalty from colleagues and subordinates alike, and was confrontational with politicians. He enjoyed the trappings of power including a Daimler with the vehicle registration number \"NCB 1\", an executive aeroplane (a six-seater De Havilland Dove which he and other Board members used to visit the far-flung coalfields) and a flat in Eaton Square. His behaviour earned him the nickname \"Old King Coal\", a pun on Old King Cole. However, he threw himself into the job with vigour and enthusiasm, visiting pits, arguing with miners at the coalface and developing a deep knowledge of the industry. In 1963 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \"Coal - Its Place in the National Economy\".\n\nAs Chairman of the NCB, Robens oversaw substantial cuts in the mining industry, many of them reflecting market forces and government policies originated before he assumed the post. Although he lobbied to protect the industry, his reputation as a socialist necessarily suffered—when he took over as NCB chair there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners, but by the time he left the post ten years later there were only 292 pits employing 283,000 miners. For a while Robens had a constructive working relationship with miners' leader Will Paynter, but he had a combative relationship with the Wilson Labour government. Industrial relations deteriorated during his tenure, and there was an unofficial strike in 1969 that lost £15 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of a walkout by 140 of the 307 NCB collieries.\n\nRobens expressed concern at the poor health and safety record of the coal industry, and championed campaigns to reduce accidents and to counter chronic occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis. Although the number of fatal and serious accidents fell by over 60% during his tenure, there was also a fall in the workforce of over 50%, from 583,000 to 283,000.\n\nThe largest single blow to his reputation came from his reaction to the catastrophic 1966 industrial accident at Aberfan. On the morning of 21 October, a massive spoil heap from the nearby Merthyr Vale Colliery collapsed onto the village of Aberfan, burying 20 houses and the Pantglas Junior School in a landslide, thirty feet deep, of water-saturated slurry that killed 116 schoolchildren and 28 adults.\n\nRobens decided to go ahead with his installation as the first Chancellor of the new University of Surrey before going to Aberfan, and he did not arrive until the evening of the Saturday following the day of the disaster, a blunder that was compounded by the actions of NCB staff, who falsely informed the Minister of Power, Richard Marsh, that Robens was at Aberfan. It was always his policy to send the most senior mining engineer to the scene of a disaster to coordinate rescue operations. Speaking to the media on the Sunday after the disaster, Robens was concerned that the initial shock and sorrow might give way to anger, possibly directed towards the men who worked at the top of the spoil heaps. To avoid this, he said that those men could not have foreseen what happened. A TV interview during which he made that comment proved to be unacceptable for broadcasting, owing to the atmospheric conditions; instead, the interviewer broadcast a paraphrase of the interview that wrongly made it seem that Robens had claimed that no one in the NCB could have foreseen the disaster. This was later taken by the Aberfan disaster enquiry to imply that the Board was contesting liability, notwithstanding the 19th-century case of \"Rylands v Fletcher\" which meant that the Board had absolute liability for damage caused by a 'dangerous escape' of material. Conversely, in a later interview Robens claimed that the disaster had been caused by \"natural unknown springs\" beneath the tip; but evidence emerged that the existence of these springs was common knowledge.\n\nThe report of the Davies Tribunal which inquired into the disaster was highly critical of the NCB and Robens. He had proposed to appear at the outset of the enquiry to admit the NCB's full responsibility for the disaster, but the Chairman of the Tribunal advised him that this would not be necessary. In the event, when it was clear that his earlier comments to reporters had been misinterpreted at the Tribunal as a denial of responsibility, he offered to appear at the enquiry to set the matter straight. He conceded that the NCB was at fault, an admission which would have rendered much of the inquiry unnecessary had it been made at the outset, notwithstanding the advice of Lord Edmund-Davies that his appearance was not necessary. After the report was published in August 1967, Robens wrote to Marsh, the Minister of Power, offering his resignation; this was rejected by him and by Prime Minister Wilson, although several cabinet members argued strongly that Robens ought to be removed.\n\nThere have been allegations that the resignation offer was \"bogus\" and Robens had been assured that it would not be accepted. According to Ronald Dearing, then a part-time member of the NCB, Richard Marsh was advised that Robens was \"taking the coal industry through a period of painful contraction without big strikes\" and the strong support for him within the coal industry and the union movement were crucial to the decision to retain him. When Robens advised a meeting of the full Board that he had offered his resignation, there was surprise and consternation; Cecil King, a part-time member of the Board, rose to his feet and told Robens that in doing so he had acted correctly.\n\nIn the wake of the disaster, Robens was asked that the NCB should fund the removal of the remaining tips from Aberfan. He was advised, however, that the cost of doing so would have obliged the NCB to exceed its borrowing limits, which had been set by the government. To incur that cost would, in effect, have broken the law. It was not that Robens refused to pay. He had acceded to a request from the bereaved mothers of Aberfan to meet them to hear their views, and he was received by them with courtesy. In the end, the cost was met partly by the Board and partly by the Government, with a levy made on the Aberfan Disaster Fund.\n\nThe Trustees of the Disaster Fund, which had been raised by public appeal, had been put under \"intolerable pressure\" to make a contribution of £150,000 (£2 million at 2016 prices) to cover the cost of removing the tips – an action that was \"unquestionably unlawful\" under charity law – and the Charity Commission took no action to protect the Fund from this misappropriation of funds.\n\nThere is no evidence that prosecution for corporate manslaughter was considered at the time. Robens was exonerated by the official history of the NCB but he remains condemned in other quarters.\n\nIn 1969, Robens was selected by Barbara Castle to chair a committee on workplace health and safety. This led to the 1972 Robens Report which controversially championed the idea of self-regulation by employers. The Report itself led to the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the creation of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive.\n\nFollowing the Conservative victory in the 1970 general election, Robens found the new administration's distaste for nationalisation at odds with his own rather paternalistic views. He fell into conflict with Prime Minister Edward Heath and Minister of State for Industry Sir John Eden. Robens left the NCB in 1971 but always insisted that his tenure was a success.\n\nRobens had become a director of the Bank of England in 1966 and a member of the board of directors of Times Newspapers in 1967. He was Chairman of Vickers from 1971 to 1979, opposing the Labour plans for nationalisation that led to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. He was Chairman of Johnson Matthey from 1971 to 1983, and a director of Trust House Forte and several other companies. His lifestyle was increasingly at odds with his socialist beginnings and by 1979, he had become aligned with the Conservative Party.\n\nHe left public life in 1982, retiring with his wife (died 2008) to Laleham Abbey, once the home of The 7th Earl of Lucan. Robens suffered the first of two debilitating strokes in 1992 and ultimately died in 1999 aged 88. \n\nRobens's period at the National Coal Board was mentioned in the folk songs of the period. Ed Pickford, who was a miner in the Durham Coalfield, was highly critical of Robens: his song \"The Pound a Week Rise\" criticises the low wages paid to coal miners during Robens's reign, and his song \"One Miner's Life\" refers to the widespread pit closures. Jock Purdon, a miner who was made redundant on the closure of Harraton Colliery in Durham, wrote the song \"Farewell to Cotia\" about the migration of redundant miners across the country and particularly to Nottinghamshire, which he referred to as \"Robens's promised land\".\n\n\n"}

She is considered to be the last fluent speaker of the Flinders island lingua franca, a Tasmanian language, and her wax cylinder recordings of songs are the only audio recordings of any of Tasmania's indigenous languages. Her recordings were inducted into the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register in 2017.\n\nAlthough there has been dispute as to whether she or Truganini was the last full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal, Smith was officially recognised as the last Tasmanian Aboriginal by the Government in 1889.\n\nFanny Cochrane's mother Tanganutura and father Cottrel Cochrane (European), according to Tindale (Nicremeric being her stepfather) and both were two of the Tasmanian Aboriginals settled on Flinders Island in the 1830s by George Augustus Robinson, and she was born at Settlement Point (or Wybalenna, meaning Black Man's House) on Flinders Island. No indigenous name is known; Robinson gave European names to all the Indigenous Tasmanians who arrived at the Island as part of his attempt to suppress their culture.\n\nFrom the age of five to eight she lived in the home of Robert Clark, the Wybalenna preacher, and was then sent to the orphan school in Hobart to learn domestic service skills after which she returned to Wybalenna. She served as Clark's servant until the station closed in 1847. In 1847 her parents, along with the survivors of Wybalenna were removed to Oyster Cove.\nNote that there is no evidence that Nicermenic was the father and was not on Flinders Island in the 1830s. In June 1834, the year of Fanny's birth on Flinders Island, he was reported to Robinson as being involved in stealing a boat on the Leven River on the NW Coast with Probelatter.\n\nIn 1854, Fanny married William Smith, an English sawyer and ex-convict, and between 1855 and 1880 they had 11 children.\n\nFollowing her marriage, Fanny and her husband ran a boarding-house in Hobart. After receiving a government annuity of £24 and a land grant of , she selected land near Oyster Cove to be near her mother, sister and brother and the couple moved there shortly before their first child was born. The Smiths grew their own food but derived their income from timber.\n\nFollowing the death of Truganini in 1876, Fanny laid claim to be \"the last Tasmanian\". The government of the Colony of Tasmania recognised this claim in 1889 and granted her of land and increased her annuity to £50. She became a Methodist and gave the land needed to build a Methodist church at Nicholls Rivulet, which opened in 1901.\n\nCochrane Smith died of pneumonia and pleurisy at Port Cygnet, from Oyster Cove, on 24 February 1905. There was some dispute at the time of her death as to whether she or Truganini was the last Tasmanian Aboriginal person. But was officially recognised by the Government in 1889 as the last Tasmanian Aborigine about 30 years after Truganini passed.\n\nIn 1898, Henry Ling Roth published a paper in the \"Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute\" examining Smith's claim to be a \"full-blood\" Aboriginal Tasmanian. He did not examine her personally, but compared locks of her hair with samples of earlier Tasmanians, and conducted a photographic comparison of her and Truganini. Roth concluded that Smith was actually mixed-race, as she had \"Europeanised\" facial characteristics, much lighter skin than Truganini, and hair that was \"wavy\" rather than \"woolly\".\n\nSmith is known for her wax cylinder recordings of Aboriginal songs, made in 1903, which constitute the only audio recordings of an indigenous Tasmanian language. Five cylinders were cut; however, when it was 1949, only four remained as \"A fifth cylinder, on which was recorded the translation of the songs, was broken some time ago\". Upon hearing her own performance, Smith had cried \"My poor race. What have I done\"; she believed the voice to be that of her mother.\n\nThe recording of Smith's songs was the subject of a 1998 song by Australian folk singer Bruce Watson, \"The Man and the Woman and the Edison Phonograph\". Watson is the great-grandson of Horace Watson, who recorded Fanny in 1903.\n\nA photograph of Fanny Cochrane Smith and Horace Watson is displayed in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.\n\n"}

Hong Kong had a population of 7.34 million in mid-2016.\n\nThe great majority of the population mostly follow Chinese traditional religions, which include the worship of local gods and ancestors. Also, in many cases people avoid declaring their religious affiliation in surveys. Traditional Chinese religions were not encouraged during the British rule over Hong Kong, which favoured Christianity. With the end of British colonial rule and the return of sovereignty over the city-state to China, there renewal of Buddhist and Chinese folk religions has occurred.\n\nChinese folk religion, also named Shenism, was the indigenous religion of the Han Chinese. Its focus is the worship of the \"shen\" (神 \"expressions\", \"gods\"), that are the generative powers of nature, also including, in the human sphere, ancestors and progenitors of families or lineages, and divine heroes that made a significant imprinting in the history of the Chinese civilisation.\n\nTraditionally Hong Kong Chinese practised Daoist or folk religion, along with some Buddhist practices and ancestor worship. In recent decades urban residential areas seldom have neighborhood temples. Bosco argues that modern postindustrial life styles do not comport well with traditional practices. Many residents fail to recognize their practices as religious. Instead they regard many traditional practices and rituals, such as neighborhood processions, as part of the unremarkable heritage representing traditional Hong Kong culture. Consequently, religion is often overlooked in Hong Kong. One result, says Bosco, is that diversity and tolerance are the characteristics that most mark the Hong Kong religious landscape.\n\nConfucianism, based on the teachings of Confucius who lived in ancient China from 551 to 479 BC, is mainly a holistic moral code for human relations with emphasis on the importance of tradition and rites. The major festival of Confucianism in Hong Kong is Confucius' Birthday that falls on the 27th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. Confucians in Hong Kong have been deeply involved in education. They run a number of local schools with an objective of promoting the teachings of Confucius.\n\nTaoism is a religious philosophy and ritual tradition that emphasises living in harmony and union with the \"Tao\", the principle of nature. Notable Taoist temples in Hong Kong include the Wong Tai Sin Temple located in the Wong Tai Sin District in Kowloon. This popular temple is dedicated to Wong Tai Sin.\n\nBuddhism has a considerable number of adherents in Hong Kong. Among the most prominent Buddhist temples in the city there are the Chi Lin Nunnery in Diamond Hill, built in the Tang Dynasty's architectural style; and the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, famous for the outdoor bronze statue, Tian Tan Buddha, which attracts a large number of visitors during the weekends and holidays.\n\nBuddhist organisations and temples in Hong Kong have long been involved in social welfare and education. The Buddhist Association of Hong Kong operates a dozen primary and secondary schools, and elderly homes as well as centres for youth and children in Hong Kong.\n\nThe leadership of mainstream Buddhists organisations have aligned themselves with the establishment in Hong Kong. For example, high-ranking Buddhist Association's executives have openly endorsed the re-election of the city's former Chief Executive Donald Tsang. Several of the association's members were on the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law.\n\nUnder the leadership of the former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, the Hong Kong government formally recognised the influence of Buddhism in Hong Kong. In 1997 the government designated Buddha's Birthday as a public holiday, which replaced the Queen's birthday holiday. Tung himself is a Buddhist and participated in major, widely publicised Buddhist activities in Hong Kong and China.\n\nAcademic studies and research of Buddhism in Hong Kong have thrived over the past decades. The University of Hong Kong has a Centre of Buddhist Studies. The Chinese University of Hong Kong also has a Centre for the Study of Humanistic Buddhism.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai International has an estimated 50,000 members in Hong Kong. The local association is called Soka Gakkai International of Hong Kong (HKSGI) and it promotes peace, culture and education based on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nChristianity is one of the most influential religions in Hong Kong. It gained influence partially due to its existence Hong Kong under British Crown rule from 1841 to 1997, and the work of many Western mission agencies from many countries. The Anglican Church held a nominal privileged status through the influenced of the British colonial government.\n\nAfter the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the China in 1997, governmental support from the Church of England was reduced. In China, the ruling Communist Party distrusts missions and humanitarian entities with international religious ties, like religious organizations with missionary connected objectives. China officially supports state atheism and views all religion including Christianity as subversive. The government has in the past closed many churches and schools on the mainland and continues to practice religious persecution of minority religious groups. Since 2010, mainland China has gradually limited Hong Kong's Christian communities' ability to organize their churches in mainland China. Chinese officials have barred mainland residents from attending certain religious conferences in Hong Kong and sought increased oversight of mainland programs run by Hong Kong religious workers.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Hong Kong was established as an apostolic prefecture in 1841 and as an Apostolic Vicariate in 1874. It became a diocese in 1946. About 379,000 Hong Kong people are Catholics as of 2016, many of them immigrants from the Philippines.\n\nMasses are conducted in Cantonese, with around three-fifths of the parishes providing services in English and in Tagalog (for the Filipino community) in some cases.\n\nThe diocese has established its own administrative structure while maintaining close links with the Pope and other Catholic communities around the world. The assistant secretary-general of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences has his office in Hong Kong. The diocese runs around 320 Catholic schools and kindergartens which have about 286,000 pupils. The Catholic Board of Education of Hong Kong assists this area. Medical and social services include about six hospitals, 15 clinics, 13 social centres, 15 hostels, 12 homes for the aged, 15 rehabilitation service centres and many self-help clubs and associations. Caritas—which runs many youth and social organisations and a hospital—is the official social welfare arm of the Roman Catholic Church in Hong Kong.\n\nTo reach people through the media, the diocese publishes two weekly newspapers: \"Kung Kao Po\" and \"Sunday Examiner\". In addition, the Diocesan Audio-Visual Centre produces tapes and films for use in schools and parishes and, overall, the Hong Kong Catholic Social Communications Office acts as an information and public relations channel for the diocese.\n\nThe presence of the Protestant community dates back to 1841.\n\nAccording to the data of HKSAR government, About 480,000 Protestants live in Hong Kong as of 2016; major denominations are Adventists, Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Church of Christ in China, Methodists, Pentecostals and the Salvation Army.\n\nProtestant organisations operate three post-secondary institutions: the Chung Chi College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Baptist University and Lingnan University. They run around 144 secondary schools, 192 primary schools, 273 kindergartens and 116 nurseries.\n\nThe Protestant community operates about 16 theological seminaries and Bible institutes, 16 publishing houses and 57 bookshops. They run seven hospitals, 18 clinics and 59 social service organisations, 74-day care centres, 17 children's homes, 35 homes for the elderly, 106 elderly centres, two schools for the blind and deaf, 47 training centres for the mentally handicapped and 15 camp sites.\n\nTwo weekly newspapers, \"The Christian Weekly\" and \"The Christian Times\", are run by Protestants. Two ecumenical bodies facilitate cooperative work among the Protestant churches in Hong Kong. The older one, dating from 1915, is the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. The other one is the Hong Kong Christian Council, formed in 1954.\n\nAs in mainland China, Protestant churches in Hong Kong provide religious care to all who attend worship services.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had 22,500 recorded members in Hong Kong in 2013. Among these, 5,565 are estimated to be active in the faith.\n\nThe LDS Church first sent missionaries to Hong Kong in 1853 but did not establish headquarters until 1949. In 1996 the Church completed the Hong Kong China Temple in Kowloon. In 2005 the Church Administration Building Hong Kong was opened. The geographical administrative area for the China Hong Kong LDS Mission includes all of China.\n\nThe Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia () is the only church of Eastern Christianity in Hong Kong. It was set up in November 1996 by the decision of the Holy Great Synod of Constantinople. It is now under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nThere were over 300,000 Muslims in Hong Kong in 2016, most of them are domestic workers from Indonesia and also Indian Muslims. Four main mosques and seven madrasas are run by Khatme Nubuwwat Islamic Council, and are used daily for prayers. The Khatme Nubuwwat Islamic Council is located in Sham Shui Po, and is headed by Qari Muhammad Tayyab Qasmi.\n\nThe oldest mosque in the city is the Shelley Street Mosque, which was built in the 1840s and rebuilt in 1915. The Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre on Nathan Road opened in 1984. The Masjid and Islamic Centre on Oi Kwan Road in Wan Chai was opened in September 1981. The Cape Collinson Muslim Cemetery also has a mosque.\n\nThe Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong coordinates religious affairs and manages mosques and Muslim cemeteries in Hong Kong. The constituent bodies of the Trustees are the Islamic Union of Hong Kong, the Pakistan Association, the Indian Muslim Association and the Dawoodi Bohra Association.\n\nCharitable work is carried out by the Muslim community, including financial aid to the needy, medical care, educational assistance, the provision of an Islamic kindergarten and assistance for the aged. In addition to the established Muslim community, there has been a sharp increase in the number of Indonesian migrant domestic workers, who numbered 123.000 at end 2008.\n\nThere were 100,000 Hindus in Hong Kong in 2016, most of whom are immigrants from India, Nepal and Southeast Asian countries. The Hindu temple in Happy Valley is an important community centre for meditation and worship (puja). The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has a center in Hong Kong, established in 1981. Other temples are run by the Sai Baba and Chinmaya Mission groups. There is a Hindu crematorium in Cape Collins. Major religious holidays including Holi, Dussehra and Diwali are celebrated at the temples as well as in devotees' homes.\n\nLike all \"Gurdwaras\", Sikh temples in Hong Kong provide free meals and short-term accommodation to visitors. The main holydays observed are the birthdays of Guru Nanak (founder of the faith), Guru Gobind Singh (the 10th Guru), and Vasakhi (birthday of all Sikhs). Sikhs originally came to Hong Kong from Panjab - \n[Now India/Pakistan] as a part of the British Armed Forces in the 19th century. Hong Konger Sikhs in this century serve HKSAR in all sectors (Police, Business & Administration). \nTheir faith teaches them to be loyal to the land where they live in or are born in, with an aim to contribute to the society. There are around 12,000 Sikhs in Hong Kong as of 2016.\n\nWith a history dating back to the 1840s, Hong Kong's Jewish community, comprising families from various parts of the world, worships at three main congregations. Daily services are held at the Ohel Leah Synagogue (Orthodox), Sabbath and festival services at the United Jewish Congregation of Hong Kong (Reform). Both are located in the same residential complex in Robinson Road. Daily services are also held at the Chabad Lubavitch shul based in the Mandarin Oriental, and in Kehilat Zion Hechal Ezra (Sephardi) in Kowloon.\n\nThe Ohel Leah Synagogue was built in 1901 on land given by Sir Jacob Sassoon and his family and includes a mikvah (ritual bath). There is also a Jewish cemetery in Happy Valley. The site next to the Ohel Leah Synagogue, now containing a residential complex, also houses the Jewish Community Centre which serves all three congregations. The centre offers its 400 member families and visiting Jewish guests kosher dining and banquets, cultural and recreational facilities as well as a specialist library covering all aspects of Judaica.\n\nThere are about 500 Jains in Hong Kong, who immigrated to Hong Kong later than most other Indian groups. They originate mostly from the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Their community grew rapidly during the 1980s. The Jains are most prominent in the diamond trading business. In 1996, members of the community founded a Jain temple, the Shree Hong Kong Jain Sangh.\n\nThere are five major festivals in the Chinese lunar calendar, with the Lunar New Year being the most important. Gifts and visits are exchanged among friends and relatives and children receive \"lai see\", lucky money.\n\nDuring the Ching Ming Festival in spring, ancestral graves are visited. In early summer (fifth day of the fifth lunar month), the Tuen Ng Festival is celebrated with dragon boat races and by eating cooked glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaves.\n\nThe Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. Gifts of mooncakes, wine and fruit are exchanged and adults and children go into parks and the countryside at night with colourful lanterns. Chung Yeung is on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, when many visit their ancestors' graves or hike up mountains in remembrance of an ancient Chinese family's escape from plague and death by fleeing to a mountain top.\n\nApart from the above traditional festivals, a number of important religious festivals, including Good Friday, Easter, Buddha's Birthday and Christmas, have been listed as public holidays.\n\n"}

Native to the plateau of the State of Jalisco in central Mexico, as one of the unarmed agaves, it is popular as an ornamental plant in gardens in many other places with subtropical and warm climates.\n\nAlthough the plant can appear acaulescent, stems often reach 50 to 150 cm (20–60 in) in length, and old leaves fall off, leaving the stems visible. The leaves are ovate-acuminate, 50–70 cm (20–28 in) long and 12–16 cm (5–6 in) wide, pale in color, ranging from a light gray to a light yellowish green. There are no teeth, nor terminal spines, although the leaves taper to soft points that fray with age. The numerous, egg-shaped and tapered leaves are slightly softer than most Agave species, they are bright glaucous-gray to light yellowish green and stingless. \n\nThe inflorescence is a dense raceme 2.5 to 3 meters (8 to 10 ft) high (usually curved), with greenish-yellow flowers, growing after many years.\n\nSpecimens were sent to Kew by the explorer Galeotti in 1834, from an unspecified location in central Mexico.

The 426 m (1,398 ft) long tunnel was a technical sensation; 24 m (80 ft) beneath the surface, two 6 m (20 ft) diameter tubes connect central Hamburg with the docks and shipyards on the south side of the river Elbe. This was a big improvement for tens of thousands of workers in one of the busiest harbors in the world.\n\nFour large lifts on either side of the tunnel carry pedestrians and vehicles to the bottom. The two tunnels are both still in operation, though due to their limited capacity by today's standards, other bridges and tunnels have been built and taken over most of the traffic.\n\nIn 2008 approximately 300,000 cars, 63,000 bicycles, and 700,000 pedestrians used the tunnel. The tunnel is opened 24 hours for pedestrians and bicycles. For motorized vehicles, opening times are currently Monday to Friday from 5:20 AM to 8:00 PM and on Saturdays from 5:20 AM to 4:00 PM.\n\nOn 22 July 1907 the construction, undertaken by Philipp Holzmann, started to connect the quarters of St. Pauli near the \"Landungsbrücken\" and Steinwerder.\n\nWork was done under pressure because the tunnel was below the water table of the Elbe. This type of building technique was used in the 19th century, in large engineering excavations, such as with the piers of bridges and with tunnels, where caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding the excavations, such as the foundations of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.\n\nWorkers who spend time in high-pressure atmospheric pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson without slowly reducing the surrounding pressure. Due to the problems associated with decompression sickness, many of the men working on the Elbe tunnel were affected by what was known at the time as \"Caissons Disease\". Of 4,400 workers three men died, 74 suffered severe cases and more than 600 came down with light symptoms.\n\nThe tunnel opened on 7 September 1911.\n\nIn the tunnel an art exhibition and a long-distance running event \"Elbtunnel-Marathon\" take place. In 2008 the tunnel participated in the \"Tag des offenen Denkmals\" (\"Day of the open heritage site\"), a Germany-wide annual event sponsored by the \"Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz\" that opens cultural heritage sites to the public.\n\nThe old tunnel has featured in several films including \"The Odessa File\", \"Matchless\", \"$\", \"The American Friend\" (Der Amerikanische Freund) and \"Secret Agent Fireball\".\n\nThe tunnel was also featured in the music video for \"One (Always Hardcore)\" by German band Scooter.\n\nThe tunnel walls are decorated with glazed terra cotta ornaments displaying items related to the Elbe river. While most fish or crabs, a few show different items like litter and rats, too.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099759", "title": "Pseudopotential", "text": "Pseudopotential\n\nIn physics, a pseudopotential or effective potential is used as an approximation for the simplified description of complex systems. Applications include atomic physics and neutron scattering. The pseudopotential approximation was first introduced by Hans Hellmann in 1934.\n\nThe pseudopotential is an attempt to replace the complicated effects of the motion of the core (i.e. non-valence) electrons of an atom and its nucleus with an effective potential, or pseudopotential, so that the Schrödinger equation contains a modified effective potential term instead of the Coulombic potential term for core electrons normally found in the Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe pseudopotential is an effective potential constructed to replace the atomic all-electron potential (full-potential) such that core states are eliminated \"and\" the valence electrons are described by pseudo-wavefunctions with significantly fewer nodes. This allows the pseudo-wavefunctions to be described with far fewer Fourier modes, thus making plane-wave basis sets practical to use. In this approach usually only the chemically active valence electrons are dealt with explicitly, while the core electrons are 'frozen', being considered together with the nuclei as rigid non-polarizable ion cores. It is possible to self-consistently update the pseudopotential with the chemical environment that it is embedded in, having the effect of relaxing the frozen core approximation, although this is rarely done. In codes using local basis functions, like Gaussian, often effective core potentials are used that only freeze the core electrons. \n\nFirst-principles pseudopotentials are derived from an atomic reference state, requiring that the pseudo- and all-electron valence eigenstates have the same energies and amplitude (and thus density) outside a chosen core cut-off radius formula_1.\n\nPseudopotentials with larger cut-off radius are said to be \"softer\", that is more rapidly convergent, but at the same time less \"transferable\", that is less accurate to reproduce realistic features in different environments.\n\nMotivation:\n\nApproximations:\n\nEarly applications of pseudopotentials to atoms and solids based on attempts to fit atomic spectra achieved only limited success. Solid-state pseudopotentials achieved their present popularity largely because of the successful fits by Walter Harrison to the nearly free electron Fermi surface of aluminum (1958) and by James C. Phillips to the covalent energy gaps of silicon and germanium (1958). Phillips and coworkers (notably Marvin L. Cohen and coworkers) later extended this work to many other semiconductors, in what they called \"semiempirical pseudopotentials\".\n\n\"Norm-conserving\" and \"ultrasoft\" are the two most common forms of pseudopotential used in modern plane-wave electronic structure codes. They allow a basis-set with a significantly lower cut-off (the frequency of the highest Fourier mode) to be used to describe the electron wavefunctions and so allow proper numerical convergence with reasonable computing resources. An alternative would be to augment the basis set around nuclei with atomic-like functions, as is done in LAPW. Norm-conserving pseudopotential was first proposed by Hamann, Schlüter, and Chiang (HSC) in 1979. The original HSC norm-conserving pseudopotential takes the following form:\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3 projects a one-particle wavefunction, such as one Kohn-Sham orbital, to the angular momentum labeled by formula_4. formula_5 is the pseudopotential that acts on the projected component. Different angular momentum states then feel different potentials, thus the HSC norm-conserving pseudopotential is non-local, in contrast to local pseudopotential which acts on all one-particle wave-functions in the same way.\n\nNorm-conserving pseudopotentials are constructed to enforce two conditions.\n\n1. Inside the cut-off radius formula_1, the norm of each pseudo-wavefunction be identical to its corresponding all-electron wavefunction:\n\n2. All-electron and pseudo wavefunctions are identical outside cut-off radius formula_1.\n\nUltrasoft pseudopotentials relax the norm-conserving constraint to reduce the necessary basis-set size further at the expense of introducing a generalized eigenvalue problem. With a non-zero difference in norms we can now define:\n\nand so a normalised eigenstate of the pseudo Hamiltonian now obeys the generalized equation\n\nwhere the operator formula_14 is defined as\n\nwhere formula_16 are projectors that form a dual basis with the pseudo reference states inside the cut-off radius, and are zero outside:\n\nA related technique is the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.\n\nEnrico Fermi introduced a pseudopotential, formula_18, to describe the scattering of a free neutron by a nucleus. The scattering is assumed to be \"s\"-wave scattering, and therefore spherically symmetric. Therefore, the potential is given as a function of radius, formula_19:\n\nformula_20,\n\nwhere formula_21 is the Planck constant divided by formula_22, formula_23 is the mass, formula_24 is the Dirac delta function, formula_25 is the bound coherent neutron scattering length, and formula_26 the center of mass of the nucleus. The Fourier transform of this formula_27-function leads to the constant neutron form factor.\n\nJames Charles Phillips developed a simplified pseudopotential while at Bell Labs useful for describing silicon and germanium.\n\n\n\n"}

After the conquest of the region beginning in 136BC, the Romans established the Augustan citadel of \"Bracara\", modern Braga, in 20 BC. \n\nAppian wrote they were a very warlike people. According to him, The Bracari women warriors fought defending their town \"never turning, never never showing their backs, or uttering a cry,\" preferring death to captivity.\n\nIt has long been known that they spoke a Celtic language, as can be seen in the inscription dedicated to the goddess Nabia at Braga's \"Fonte do Ídolo\" (Portuguese for the \"Fountain of the Idol\"), or in the name of their town \"Tongobriga\" (in Marco de Canaveses).\nThe region was home to some native and notable citadels that fiercely resisted Roman rule and were sieged by the Romans. These were Lambriaca, Avobriga, and Cinania. Lambriaca and Avobriga were located near the coast, probably near the river mouth of the Ave river where some citadels ruins are known. At the beginning of the 1st century, the Citânia de Briteiros was one of their main citadels and seat of the \"consilium gentis.\" Cividade de Terroso, near the Ave river mouth, shows archaeological signs of the Roman siege and conquest. It was suggested that Citânia de Briteiros could be ancient Cinania. However, this is not certain, as there were other citadels nearby, including Citânia de Sanfins. It is known that cinania had luxuries and an iron ore mine, used for a surprise attack on the Roman camp. It is possible that the Celtic Nemetati were an allied tribe of the Bracari, known previously as \"Kallaikoi\". Neighbouring this people, were the Grovii, who dwelt in the river mouths of the region. They, and the Heleni, were of Greek origin, according to some ancient sources.\n\nThe goddess Nabia was very popular in the territory of the Callaici Bracari with several inscriptions, like the one at Braga's Fonte do Ídolo (Portuguese for Fountain of the Idol).\n\n\n\n"}

Baffert (born January 13, 1953) is an American racehorse trainer who trained the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. Baffert's horses have won five Kentucky Derbies, seven Preakness Stakes, three Belmont Stakes and three Kentucky Oaks.\n\nBaffert grew up on a ranch in Nogales, Arizona, where his family raised cattle and chickens. When he was 10, his father purchased some Quarter Horses and he practiced racing them on a dirt track. In his teens, he worked as a jockey for $100 a day in informal Quarter Horse races on the outskirts of Nogales. He moved from there to racing at legalized tracks, scoring his first victory at age 17 in 1970.\n\nBaffert graduated from the University of Arizona's Race Track Industry Program with a Bachelor of Science degree, got married, and began training quarter horses at a Prescott, Arizona farm. By age 20, he had developed a reputation as a trainer and was hired by other trainers to run their stables. In the 1980s, Baffert moved to California and worked at Los Alamitos Race Course, where he switched to training Thoroughbreds. He got his first big break in 1992 when he won his first Breeder's Cup race with Thirty Slews. He became the leading money-winning trainer in the United States four times.\n\nBaffert's history in the American classic races began in 1996 when he trained a three-year-old colt named Cavonnier, who ran second in the Kentucky Derby. In 1997, he trained the gray colt Silver Charm to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, finishing second in the Belmont. Baffert revisited the Derby the next year, sending two top colts, Real Quiet and Indian Charlie, to Louisville. Real Quiet won the race that year, but Baffert also finished third with Indian Charlie. Real Quiet won the Preakness as well, but, like Silver Charm, the horse was denied a Triple Crown win and finished second in the Belmont Stakes by a nose. Baffert, however, became the first trainer in history to win the Derby and Preakness in back-to-back years.\n\nBaffert did not win another classic race until 2001, when he swept the Preakness and Belmont Stakes with eventual Hall of Fame member Point Given. Although he was denied a Derby win that year, he finished third in the race with Congaree. Baffert won the Derby a third time the following year with War Emblem. The colt went on to win the Preakness Stakes, giving the trainer his third shot at winning the Triple Crown. The colt lost the Belmont Stakes after breaking poorly from the starting gate. Baffert did not have a horse hit the board again in any of the Triple Crown races until 2009, when he trained Pioneerof The Nile to a second-place finish in the Derby.\n\nFinally, after waiting eight years, Baffert trained Lookin At Lucky, co-owned by longtime client and good friend Mike Pegram, to win the Preakness Stakes in 2010. The colt skipped the Belmont Stakes but became the champion three-year-old colt that year. In 2012, Baffert saddled Bodemeister, named for the trainer's youngest son, Bode, to second-place finishes in the Derby and Preakness. He saddled Paynter in the Belmont Stakes later that year, but that colt, like his stablemate Bodemeister, finished second.\n\nIn 2015, Baffert trained the 2014 champion two-year-old colt American Pharoah to win the Triple Crown, the first to do so in 37 years. He won 141st Kentucky Derby, bringing his total number of victories in the race to four; Baffert also ran the third-place finisher, the previously undefeated colt Dortmund. American Pharoah next won the 140th Preakness Stakes, making six victories in that race for Baffert, who also finished fourth with Dortmund. Then, when American Pharoah won the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the win was the fourth attempt at a Triple Crown for Baffert, who at age 62 became the second-oldest trainer to win a Triple Crown.\n\nBaffert also trained the 2018 Triple Crown Winner, Justify.\n\nBetween 1997 and 1999 he won the Eclipse Award as outstanding trainer three years running and was voted the 1997 Big Sport of Turfdom Award.\n\nBaffert has trained horses that won thirteen American Classic Races, fourteen Breeders' Cup races, three Dubai World Cups and the inaugural Pegasus World Cup. In 2010 Baffert scored a first when Misremembered, a horse he bred, owned by his wife Jill and their friend George Jacobs, won the Santa Anita Handicap, marking Baffert's first Grade I win as a breeder. He also has seven wins in the Santa Anita Derby, eight in the Haskell Invitational Handicap, and thirteen wins in the Del Mar Futurity, a race he won seven straight times from 1996 to 2002, when run as a Grade II event. He also won the race in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016 when run as a Grade I event. He has won the Kentucky Oaks three times: first in 1999 with Silverbulletday, who was later selected for the Hall of Fame, then with Plum Pretty in 2011 and lastly with Abel Tasman in 2017.\n\nBaffert has trained for numerous owners including The Thoroughbred Corporation (Prince Ahmed bin Salman), Golden Eagle Farm (John C. Mabee), the late Bob Lewis and his wife Beverly, Robert and Janice McNair, for whom he trained champions Chilukki and five-time Grade I winner Congaree, and his good friend Mike Pegram, for whom he has trained champions Real Quiet, Silverbulletday, Captain Steve, Midnight Lute, and Lookin At Lucky. In 2014, Baffert teamed with owner Kaleem Shah to win his first Breeders' Cup Classic with Bayern. Most recently, Baffert has trained horses for Zayat Stables, including Pioneerof The Nile, Zensational, Bodemeister, Paynter, and American Pharoah, and for Juddmonte Farms, most notably Arrogate.\n\nBaffert was inducted into Lone Star Park's Hall of Fame in 2007, and in 2009, he was nominated and inducted to the National Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame. Baffert was elected alongside one of the best fillies he trained, Silverbulletday. Point Given was nominated in 2009, but elected and inducted in 2010.\n\nBaffert has five children: four from his first marriage to wife Sherry: Taylor, Canyon, Forest, and Savannah. He married his second wife, Jill, a former television reporter based in Louisville, in 2002. They had a son in 2004 they named \"Bode\" ( ), after skier Bode Miller. Baffert and his family reside in California.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the TV show \"Take Home Chef\".\n\nBob survived a heart attack in late March 2012 while in Dubai for a world-class race at Meydan.\n\nFollowing the 2015 Belmont win, Baffert outlined several charities that he and his wife Jill supported. He had been paid $200,000 to allow The Burger King to stand behind him in the grandstand during the televised broadcast of the Belmont, after having turned down $150,000 to allow the mascot to appear with him at the Preakness. At the post-Belmont press conference, Baffert announced he and his wife would be making substantial donations of $50,000 each to the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, the California Retirement Management Account (CARMA), and Old Friends Equine, all programs for retired race horses; and to the Permanently Disabled Jockey's Fund in memory of a Quarter Horse Jockey named Robert Z. \"Bobby\" Adair. A friend of Baffert's and an inductee into the American Quarter Horse Association Hall of Fame, Adair died on Preakness Day, May 16, 2015, at the age of 71.
